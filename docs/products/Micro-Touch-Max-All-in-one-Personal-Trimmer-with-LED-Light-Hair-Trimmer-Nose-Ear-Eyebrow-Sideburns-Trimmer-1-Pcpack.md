      <li>Panasonic trimmer allows me to make them as cute looking as my hairdresser.  </li>
      <li>The product is ok, abit flimsy and sometimes doesnt works when you turn it on</li>
      <li>I have had this micro touch for about a month and used it a couple of times and am getting better at knowing which side cuts and which side dosent.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money, I should have known better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but flimsy.</li>

      <li>it does good at trimming hair but you&#x27;ll have to be very gentle with it and take care...</li>
      <li>Works okay, plastic makes it seem  cheap.</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic, blades pull hair and stop easily and have to be cleared of hair</li>
      <li>feels cheap and comes apart to easily...</li>
      <li>When I turned it to the light option on the device it would flicker and wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
      <li>Received item and light does not work..</li>
      <li>Light never worked.  </li>
      <li>The light in my product did not work.</li>
      <li>light does not work as advertised.</li>
      <li>I was a bit put off by how cheaply it is made....</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>the led light doesn&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>: I was sent a free product sample for review.</li>
      <li>Its not going to last you till the day you die, but its great for stocking stuffer and a quick nose trimmer.  </li>
      <li>i also tried a little area on the  chest and it did remove&lt;br /&gt;the hair follicles very good without any irritation.  </li>
      <li>it works really well except for some reason my light wouldn&#x27;t work for it.</li>
      <li>and it seems well made ,useful.</li>
      <li>but  the polarity of the battery needs to be indicated more clearly.</li>
      <li>But for the price, well worth it</li>
      <li>The trimmer came with two batteries, however I was only able to fit in one.</li>
      <li>It is good for small areas of fine hair</li>
      <li>Other than that, its a good product.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t get the thing to work right</li>
      <li>but even if you do have a larger trimmer, this can still come in handy for situations and areas where a larger &amp; more powerful trimmer won&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While I originally liked this model because it runs at the same power whether the light is on or not (some other models don&#x27;t use &#x27;fullpower&#x27; unless the light is on which drains the battery</li>
      <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>or if you have large areas of hair that need trimming...</li>
      <li>The blade is fairly large and I would not recommend it for nose or ears.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He says it us OK , but I don&#x27;t know if it is as he expected.</li>
      <li>Really underpowered.</li>
      <li>Its a quick cheap little tool.  </li>
      <li>This product actually works and I received it fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at the noise level because the TV commercial does not reveal a sound level for the product.</li>
      <li>This was not at all as high quality as the advertisements claim it to be.</li>
      <li>Spend a little Moe for better item.</li>
      <li>I was expecting to get my purchase in the original packing, instead I got it in loose parts</li>
      <li>I bought the same brand several years ago and it was a fine product.  </li>
      <li>So this I could live with if they didn&#x27;t take care of it.</li>
      <li>It is cheaply made, which is why I would recommend something more expensive if you will be using it a lot</li>
      <li>Nose hair has always been a problem, and it&#x27;s getting worse as I grow older, this product does great for that purpose, but as far as trimming sideburns, moustache, etc., just not enough power.,</li>
      <li>The major downside is the build quality but for the price I can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
      <li>Just a heads up, if you have very sensitive skin, like my boyfriend, it may cut you.</li>
      <li>Its ok but not as sharp as in the commercial...</li>
      <li>Cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t work half the time.</li>
      <li>Trimmer  doesn&#x27;t cut the following very good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Did not trim coarse hairs very well.  </li>
      <li>so  far.  </li>
      <li>All of these trimmers are cheap, but I usually get at least 6 months of use before it needs to be changed out, but this lasted maybe 2-3 months at most.</li>
      <li>Total junk, do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>It might cut a few hairs; but you have to hold it at just the right angle.</li>
      <li>I had owned an older version of this product which worked extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I did not return as it was very inexpensive and not worth the effort to send back.</li>

<li> Because the fit of the cover was sloppy I took the trimmer apart several times, thinking I must have not put it together correctly.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, after not that much use, the green &#x27;cover&#x27; at the end became loose and does would not snap back in properly.  </li>
<li> This is a decent little trimmer for limited use (small areas of hair where another trimmer might be too large, too likely to cut you, or too inaccurate).</li>
<li> I bought them for my teenage sons to clean up all the fur they seem to be growing (think furry like Froto) and the thought of buying something expensive or nice and finding it covered in hair and dust on the bathroom floor just makes me crazy.  </li>
<li> I knew it was a long shot</li>
<li> I hope the battery has long time working.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I was not able to find anything I liked about it.</li>
<li> Cutting too much hair at once with this trimmer may be too much for it, but that&#x27;s not the intended usage.</li>
<li> Kinda disappointed to be honest with uou</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work correctly and was not what I expected.</li>
<li> not really....</li>
<li> You still have to be careful though, or you could still cut</li>
<li> The blade is recessed so it is difficult to position it exactly where you want it.  </li>
<li> Or any other place on me, avoid this garbage .</li>
<li> Also it the blade does not work as sharp as it should be.</li>
<li> Now it will work for a few seconds before  it becomes loose again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Waste of money didn&#x27;t do half of what was shown in adervertisment</li>
<li> you might hear a bit of cutting; but It doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing too much.  </li>
<li> but diont waste your money on this item.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> I think it was a waste of money.</li>
<li> [[VIDEOID:mo38RQ7DW9URJBT]]Everything about the trimmer felt poorly made, just inserting the batteries and turning it on took multiple attempts.  </li>
<li> Terrible item, very cheap.</li>

    <li> My husbabd tried trimming his sideburns,it didn&#x27;t work, then he tried trimming his eyebrows,since it didn&#x27;t work on them either,he tried to see if it would work on his arm and it didn&#x27;t!.</li>
    <li> The light in my product did not work. I was surprised at the noise level because the TV commercial does not reveal a sound level for the product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to get my purchase in the original packing, instead I got it in loose parts</li>
    <li> Thanks!!!!!! works great, packaged with care!</li>
    <li> Works okay, plastic makes it seem  cheap.</li>
    <li> micro touch just does not work well.</li>
    <li> Dont...waste your time</li>
    <li> I liked the micro touch max it works really well except for some reason my light wouldn&#x27;t work for it. When I turned it to the light option on the device it would flicker and wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
    <li> Light never worked.  Sometime it doesn&#x27;t start but after several attempts.</li>
    <li> Its suficient for me. thanks Its excellent item over oll and light good idea.&lt;br /&gt;I recomended it. I hope the battery has long time working.</li>
    <li> This was not at all as high quality as the advertisements claim it to be. It is good for small areas of fine hair but overall it is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> feels cheap and comes apart to easily...it does good at trimming hair but you&#x27;ll have to be very gentle with it and take care...it&#x27;s very fragile...would I buy it again? not really....I was a bit put off by how cheaply it is made....</li>
    <li> Horrid. Cheap. Nasty.</li>
    <li> If you like buying pieces of s***, then hook it up. its useless and couldn&#x27;t trim anything w/o getting stuck</li>
    <li> Does not work as they show on TV advertisement. Also it the blade does not work as sharp as it should be. MAy be I had a bad product.</li>
    <li> They advertise a lot and must write their owns reviews. Cheap plastic, blades pull hair and stop easily and have to be cleared of hair&lt;br /&gt;often. I was given an upgrade by my brother and for $5.00 more it was a much better product. This micro touch would be good for&lt;br /&gt;the hair on a snake.</li>
    <li> the micro touch works well but not quite as good as it looks on tv. As with all products I suppose their is a learning curve to using this product. I have had this micro touch for about a month and used it a couple of times and am getting better at knowing which side cuts and which side dosent. It is safe to the touch as claimed and does trim nicely as claimed.</li>
    <li> This is a decent little trimmer for limited use (small areas of hair where another trimmer might be too large, too likely to cut you, or too inaccurate). Cutting too much hair at once with this trimmer may be too much for it, but that&#x27;s not the intended usage. It&#x27;s only powered by one AAA battery so its cutting power is limited. You still have to be careful though, or you could still cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside is probably the build quality. It is cheaply made, which is why I would recommend something more expensive if you will be using it a lot or if you have large areas of hair that need trimming... but even if you do have a larger trimmer, this can still come in handy for situations and areas where a larger &amp; more powerful trimmer won&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a 1 year warranty but you&#x27;ll have to ship it to them in CA with proof of purchase and $7.99 for return postage &amp; handling, so if it breaks then it would probably be cheaper and easier to just buy another unit since these aren&#x27;t expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 3 stars for what it is. The major downside is the build quality but for the price I can&#x27;t complain much. It works well enough for the situations mentioned above... just don&#x27;t expect $30+ build quality at this price and don&#x27;t expect it to do miracles or to have a lot of power and you probably won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son.  He says it us OK , but I don&#x27;t know if it is as he expected.</li>
    <li> This product actually works and I received it fairly quickly. Just a heads up, if you have very sensitive skin, like my boyfriend, it may cut you. Other than that, its a good product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> drop it in the sink and it blu apart</li>
    <li> i did try it only once so  far.  it  did a great job on the nose  and ear hairs.  i also tried a little area on the  chest and it did remove&lt;br /&gt;the hair follicles very good without any irritation.  so i would assume that i  bought a great product  at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;at the minimum price of the item i would say that the benefits are maximum.  buy it and start trimming......</li>
    <li> Horrible product! What a joke this company is by putting out such a crappy product!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo38RQ7DW9URJBT]]Everything about the trimmer felt poorly made, just inserting the batteries and turning it on took multiple attempts.  The trimmer came with two batteries, however I was only able to fit in one. Because the fit of the cover was sloppy I took the trimmer apart several times, thinking I must have not put it together correctly. The trimmer&#x27;s motor sounded underpowered. The blade is recessed so it is difficult to position it exactly where you want it.  I own Panasonic Pivoting Head trimmer which I use to sculpt my \\&quot;sideburns\\&quot; in between hair appointments.  Panasonic trimmer allows me to make them as cute looking as my hairdresser.  I was not able to do this task with this trimmer. Recessed blade, the size of the blade, the angle of the blade, and under powered motor are possible contributors to the problems I encountered. What the trimmer managed to cut was not a close trim.  The blade is fairly large and I would not recommend it for nose or ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this trimmer for testing and review from Idea Village. I always try to give an honest and fair review stating positives and negatives. Unfortunately, I was not able to find anything I liked about it. This trimmer does not feel well made and does not work well.  I can&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> the item doesn&#x27;t do a real good of trimming unless you go over the area 3 or 4 times. I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Really underpowered. Good for taking care of stray nose and ear hairs, but that&#x27;s about it.  You&#x27;ll be there for hours trying to shave/trim chest hairs, etc.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was just mine, but I had about one week of good usage of this and it quit.  Just wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
    <li> While I originally liked this model because it runs at the same power whether the light is on or not (some other models don&#x27;t use &#x27;fullpower&#x27; unless the light is on which drains the battery faster.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after not that much use, the green &#x27;cover&#x27; at the end became loose and does would not snap back in properly.  Now it will work for a few seconds before  it becomes loose again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this no longer works and I will need to find a replacement...  All of these trimmers are cheap, but I usually get at least 6 months of use before it needs to be changed out, but this lasted maybe 2-3 months at most.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Terrible item, very cheap. Didn&#x27;t work correctly and was not what I expected. Spend a little Moe for better item. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut a darn hair!  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> just a piece of crap!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get the thing to work right</li>
    <li> Its a quick cheap little tool.  Its not going to last you till the day you die, but its great for stocking stuffer and a quick nose trimmer.  I bought them for my teenage sons to clean up all the fur they seem to be growing (think furry like Froto) and the thought of buying something expensive or nice and finding it covered in hair and dust on the bathroom floor just makes me crazy.  So this I could live with if they didn&#x27;t take care of it.</li>
    <li> Received item and light does not work.. Kinda disappointed to be honest with uou</li>
    <li> This is worthless. Do not buy it. It simply does not work. No further description is necessary</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but flimsy.</li>
    <li> Crap, crap and crap. I would not suggest this piece to anyone. I think it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Seems to do all it is supposed to do. Have had it a while and it seems well made ,useful.</li>
    <li> the led light doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Its ok but not as sharp as in the commercial...</li>
    <li> light does not work as advertised. Everything else works. Would I buy another one ? Probably not. Take your chances on getting one that is fully functional.</li>
    <li> I had owned an older version of this product which worked extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;This newer version has the blades recessed and shorter, and thus the trim is insufficient and I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Trimmer  doesn&#x27;t cut the following very good.&lt;br /&gt;1. nose hair&lt;br /&gt;2. ear hair&lt;br /&gt;3. eye brows&lt;br /&gt;4. side burns&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say!!!!</li>
    <li> WAY,WAY,WAY OVERPRICED !!!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when&#x27;s his trimmer was delivered but it happens sometimes. It didn&#x27;t preform like I had thought it would.</li>
    <li> nothing to do with dealer...the item is junk. I knew it was a long shot but diont waste your money on this item.</li>
    <li> Waste of money didn&#x27;t do half of what was shown in adervertisment</li>
    <li> I bought the same brand several years ago and it was a fine product.  I bought three of these and found they&#x27;ve changed drastically for the worse.  They don&#x27;t cut your hair, just try to pull it out.  Painful to use.  Made in China!</li>
    <li> 100% Total junk. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money, I should have known better. Cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t work half the time. The battery connectors are so bad that half the time it doesn&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, get a quality trimmer!</li>
    <li> My Micro Touch Max never worked at all. Changing batteries didn&#x27;t  work.</li>
    <li> Nose hair has always been a problem, and it&#x27;s getting worse as I grow older, this product does great for that purpose, but as far as trimming sideburns, moustache, etc., just not enough power., But for the price, well worth it</li>
    <li> Never ever ever again. Doesn&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
    <li> Total junk, do not waste your money. Could not get it to trim anything. Great if you want to rip your hair out..</li>
    <li> Does not cut any hair in my nose . Or any other place on me, avoid this garbage . Worthless worthless</li>
    <li> Useless already broken</li>
    <li> Great deal great service. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better. The product is just what was shown.</li>
    <li> Junk. Doesn&#x27;t cut hair at all like the commercials show.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Meets all my requirements</li>
    <li> This is a very poor product. Pulls the hair. It will not give you a close cut.you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I liked it but  the polarity of the battery needs to be indicated more clearly. 1 2 3 4 5 6</li>
    <li> The product is ok, abit flimsy and sometimes doesnt works when you turn it on so I have to remove the battery and replace it back on</li>
    <li> Did not trim coarse hairs very well.  I did not return as it was very inexpensive and not worth the effort to send back.</li>
    <li> 2nd one ordered that did not work,  if you need one go to Walmart!</li>
    <li> It doen&#x27;t cut the hair it rips it out! bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad</li>
    <li> you might hear a bit of cutting; but It doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing too much.  It might cut a few hairs; but you have to hold it at just the right angle.</li>
