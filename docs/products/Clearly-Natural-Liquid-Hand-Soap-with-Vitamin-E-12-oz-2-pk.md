      <li>I like the Clearly Natural liquid glycerin soap very much.  </li>
      <li>It smells clean yet has a slight fragrance that is unlike so many heavy floral or fruity soaps - it&#x27;s just right!  </li>
      <li>Secondly, it smells super duper</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a very gentile glycerin soap and decided to try the Clearly Natural.</li>
      <li>This soap has a strong smell and is more difficult to get off your hands when washing than the unscented version of this liquid hand soap.</li>

      <li>, It cleans well and leaves my skin feeling very  soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Although we typically go for foam soaps around here, I find this soap is an exception to the rule. Firstly - it lasts forever: just a tiny bit is all you need for awesome cleaning. Secondly, it smells super duper (a very light and natural citrus-y flavor that doesn&#x27;t linger). And lastly, it leaves hands feeling soft (not dried out), yet clean - no residue. Bonus: The pump never clogs - which is a big difference from most liquid non-foam soaps.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a very gentile glycerin soap and decided to try the Clearly Natural. It has exceeded my expectations. I will continue to order this.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap for a guest bath.  It looks pretty and does not how too much fragrance.</li>
    <li> Low on lather but still cleans. Most importantly, It&#x27;s not harsh &amp; as drying as the vast majority of liquid hand soaps I&#x27;ve tried. And I get severely dried out hands, complete with cracked painful skin.&lt;br /&gt;Usually buy a big bottle of Dr. Bronners to use as my refill. But Amazon had a good deal on this, and the ingredients in this product looked good...so I gave it a try. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy at the price they are asking now. I&#x27;ve bought a far better soap w/ shea butter at Whole Foods for the same price- A price which causes me to look for deals on gentle soap.</li>
    <li> Good soap, good value</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  It smells great and leaves my hands feeling soft.  I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I give this product 2.5 stars. Loved the thick, rich, moisture-filled texture of this soap but the smell was not pleasant at all. I added Geranium essential oil to mask the \\&quot;off\\&quot; smell. I&#x27;ll use the resulting product at the sink, but not in the tub.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I was looking for a non-antibacterial soap that would help me with my drier hands and this is it!  Smells clean but is not &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34; that I can tell.  A little goes a long way.  Great price.  Is a rich and luxurious hand soap!</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again.  The soap is OK but I bought 6 bottles at once time... wrong. Two of the pumps were broken and leaked; two other bottles&#x27; pumps stopped working after several weeks.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this soap, will reorder</li>
    <li> This soap is really nice - it smells great and is very moisturizing. I wish that it came in larger containers so I could use it as a refill.</li>
    <li> Noticed an immediate difference in the moisture level and softness of my skin when I started using this soap.</li>
    <li> Been using the solid bars of this soap for years as they don&#x27;t dry my skin out so much as regular soap.  Moved to a place with a liquid dispenser in the shower.  No problem, filled it with this.</li>
    <li> Great smelling soap that leaves my hands feeling clean. The only thing I don&#x27;t like was how dry my hands feel after use. As a new mom, I am constantly washing my hands. If I wasn&#x27;t washing them so frequently, maybe I would buy again.</li>
    <li> We wash  our hands frequently throughout the day and the anti-bacterial liquid soaps were drying our hands, making them feel rough.  Being prone to eczema, this was a serious problem for us.  Using this Clearly Natural Vitamin E Liquid Glycerine Soap has given us such relief from the dryness.  Our hands feel clean without any lingering perfume and we have stopped suffering from dry, rough hands.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to wash our hands as often as we want without worrying about potential discomfort.  Will continue using this and the Tea Tree version.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it and it didn&#x27;t seem to actually wash dirt or grease off my hands (I bought it for the kitchen).</li>
    <li> Glad this natural soap is available.  Try it in a foaming dispenser.  I ordered and used it from the bottle that it came in for quite a while.  Then I bought 2 of the foaming dispensers from Amazon and tried this in them.  It worked fine.  You will use much less soap and save money.  All you have to do is put about 3/4 of an inch of the soap in the bottom of the foamer and then fill it the rest of the way with water.</li>
    <li> The other reviewer and I have different preferences, because what I love most about this soap is the fragrance.  I bought it on clearance at a store, which no longer sells it, and so I went online to buy it, it smells that great!  It smells clean yet has a slight fragrance that is unlike so many heavy floral or fruity soaps - it&#x27;s just right!  I also like the way it feels, not too runny or too thick.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap, It cleans well and leaves my skin feeling very  soft. I had intended to use it for a body wash, but it really isn&#x27;t meant for that.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to have non-sulfate, non-antibacterial soap.  The work great but the do have that vitamin E smell, which not everyone likes.</li>
    <li> I like the Clearly Natural liquid glycerin soap very much.  Unfortunately, one of the dispensers opened during shipping.  I only lost an ounce or two...</li>
    <li> smell is really really strong.after 2week use, my husband and I both got rash on our hands,and felt really itchy. We never got any problem with any other soap in the past. Are these really natural?</li>
    <li> Works well and very moisturizing .  No real scent, should be great in the winter.</li>
    <li> This soap smells good; It reminds me of a day spa.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped with my dry hands. I have one at every sink.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at Whole Foods.  I have to be somewhat careful about soaps (especially the more natural ones) since many contain ingredients a family member is allergic to. For me personally, this is one of the better smelling soaps I have used. That of course is a very personal preference and I can understand those who do not like it.  We have had no problems with any skin reactions.</li>
    <li> It dries the skin. Expensive and poor quality.</li>
    <li> This product smells horrible. It does seem to moisturize but I have all of the female staff complaining that they want to throw this stuff in the garbage because they can&#x27;t stand to walk around with this smell on their hands.</li>
    <li> Easy spigot to push and thick soap, pleasant fragrance!</li>
    <li> Excellent safe soap to clean your hands &amp; not dry them out.</li>
    <li> It is great it rinses off well and get me clean and does not take a lot of soap to clean me.</li>
    <li> This soap has a strong smell and is more difficult to get off your hands when washing than the unscented version of this liquid hand soap. Dumping this soap down the drain.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for frequent hand washers. The glycerin helps keep skin soft.</li>
    <li> Love this 100% glycerine liquid soap - from face to baby skin and anywhere in between is perfect: good wash, easy rinse, no residue and perfect for any skin</li>
    <li> Loved it! Great price!</li>
