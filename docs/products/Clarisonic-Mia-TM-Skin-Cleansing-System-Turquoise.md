      <li>I love the Mia.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I love the Clarisonic Mia.  </li>
      <li>My daughter really wanted this for Christmas, and she loves it, and it seems to be doing a great job on her skin, but I have no idea</li>
      <li>I bought this because so many of my friends raved about it, but now that I have one I have no idea why anyone would rave about this.</li>
      <li>I use a toner and it is soaked in so much better because of the Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>I have oily acne prone skin and this product helped me on non-breaking out days to wash off the oiliness and make up better than sponges.</li>
      <li>Just recommended it to a friend who has perfect skin, hence the fourth purchase.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen drastic results but it does help exfoliate and when I apply products they do seem to absorb better</li>
      <li>how worthwhile this purchase was.  </li>
      <li>I was able to get it in her favorite color.</li>
      <li>Glad I read the reviews and decided to purchase this item.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I received great service and i also received my purchase really fast.</li>
      <li>However, my face already looks better after I apply makeup.</li>
      <li>plus i love the color.</li>
      <li>I love it and it makes my face feel and look cleaner.  </li>
      <li>The device itself is phenomenal and gives you glowing skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s attractive, sits in the shower, and is getting used twice a day because she loves it so much, so I guess maybe it is worth it!</li>
      <li>This product is the best $ I have spent on skin care period.  </li>
      <li>It really cleans your face good.</li>
      <li>: I recommend, and think it will be especially good for anyone with thicker, more oily skin, or anyone who has to wear heavy or stage makeup.  </li>
      <li>Like the Sonicare toothbrush, it is just a better way to clean pollutants from your skin and stimulate cell growth without being abrasive.  </li>
      <li>It went through easily</li>
      <li>But with the Mia, I love the clean, but not scrubbed, feeling.  </li>
      <li>Any improvement is a good thing for my 61 year old skin!</li>
      <li>After using the Clarisonic for a couple weeks I notice a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>I have heard such great things about them, but this one just wouldn&#x27;t operate.</li>
      <li>4) fabulous way to charge the unit (via magnetic attachment)</li>
      <li>I use the Mia on my face every time I shower &amp; like the resulting smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>My younger daughter has great skin, but sleeps without removing makeup, doesn&#x27;t cleanse immediately after workouts.  </li>
      <li>But this Mia available through Amazon is NOT manufactured by Clarisonic and has not associated warranty.</li>
      <li>I use one every day and she was so excited to get it and start seeing a difference in her pores.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to use it</li>
      <li>Although this product seemed great at first- made my face super clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an esthetician and several of my clients own these and love them as well.</li>
      <li>After I clean my skin with the Clairsonic</li>
      <li>I LOVE it so much</li>
      <li>if it&#x27;s really any better than one of the $30 ones.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my face nice and soft after washing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed that it lasts and doesn&#x27;t stop working as quickly as others have stated.</li>
      <li>After I fell in love with my pink Clarisonic, I was thrilled to find the Mia mini for my 11 year-old daugther.</li>
      <li>It looks very sturdy can be used in shower, rechargeable and then the plug is taken out (magnetic) which is very cool.</li>
      <li>I got the Clarisonic Mia for my teenage daughter, because at this age girls love to wear makeup and her face never looked very clean, even after she washed it.</li>
      <li>First, when it came in the mail, the charging light didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>came straight out of the box, and never worked!!</li>
      <li>Happily received what i thought was a Clarisonic Mia a few months ago, looked just like the ones in Macys.</li>
      <li>but I love it so far.</li>
      <li>She loves it so much, and it is encouraging her to take better, more regular care of her skin.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Save the money on a year&#x27;s worth of make-up.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>After 28 days of working properly, my Mia now turns on and off spontaneously all day and will not respond to being turned on or off manually.</li>
      <li>The charger is magnetic (fun) and even though it&#x27;s just one speed, it&#x27;s the speed I wanted.</li>
      <li>and it really helps me to thoroughly clean my pores.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and CLEAN!</li>
      <li>One speed is fine, the charger could not be any simpler and the same brush heads fit the Mia and the Plus.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than getting facials!</li>
      <li>I charged it for 24 hrs before the first use and watched the care videos provided on Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>At 30 days exactly (when the Amazon return policy expires), the device stopped working at all.</li>
      <li>, however, I feel that my facial scrub cleans my face much better.</li>
      <li>I give it 4/5 stars only because even at Amazon&#x27;s better pricing, this item seems somewhat overpriced.</li>
      <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s an okay product, but if I could do it over again I would just save my money and keep on washing my face the regular way.</li>
      <li>so I will know more about that later.  </li>
      <li>does a great job of cleaning facial skin gently, and is especially suited for women who wear makeup, 3)</li>
      <li>is that much cleaner every night!</li>
      <li>Be sure you get a sensitive one if you have sensitive skin (like me)...</li>
      <li>I admit I was really nervous after reading all the &amp;#34;fake and fraudulent&amp;#34; warnings so first thing I did after receiving it was to register it online.</li>
      <li>Gently exfoliates to leave a clean clear surface on your face.</li>
      <li>Although this is a new product for me, I can easily see how other products will absorb into the clean skin better following (like</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My Clarisonic Mia is awesome! although i still break out from time to time, my face has never been as soft as it is now. Thrilled i purchased this product</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic is fake! So DON&#x27;T buy it. I was so disappointed when I found out that it was fake. Spend a few more bucks for the real one.</li>
    <li> My Dermotologist recommended that I buy a Clarsonic Mia to really cleanse my skin. The Mia is smaller than the regular Clarsonic &amp; is easier to take when I travel.  I use the Mia on my face every time I shower &amp; like the resulting smooth skin.  I was concerned that the rotating brush would splatter everywhere, but it does not. It doesn&#x27;t get the soap or cleanser in my hair or anywhere.  It has a timer in the hand-held device that turns itself off when you&#x27;ve used it for the suggested time in each area.  I recommend it &amp; give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin soft, smooth and it isn&#x27;t rough on the skin UNLESS you apply too much pressure. Just after ONE use, I could feel the difference on my skin. Glad I read the reviews and decided to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I received great service and i also received my purchase really fast. I will definitely buy more products in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago and realized that I never reviewed this awful product. It&#x27;s a fake!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came straight out of the box, and never worked!! I charged it before I used it, just like the instructions told me to. I waited the instructed amount of time. I was so excited to use it and I turned it on and....buzz...buzz...buzz. The thing sounded like it was having  vibrating convulsions! Definitely not a steady sonic vibration. I&#x27;ve used a real Clarisonic Mia before so I know how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Clarisonic with the product ID and was told that I bought a fake. I can&#x27;t believe that Amazon lets sellers sell fakes. A real shame for Amazon&#x27;s reputation.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I&#x27;ve bought one for my mom too as a gift.  My husband has his own replacement head and loves it as well.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it.  Much cheaper than getting facials!</li>
    <li> Already had a Clarisonic Plus, but I wanted a Mia for my frequent travels. One speed is fine, the charger could not be any simpler and the same brush heads fit the Mia and the Plus. My skin has never been better!</li>
    <li> I got the Clarisonic Mia for my teenage daughter, because at this age girls love to wear makeup and her face never looked very clean, even after she washed it. This was until I got the Clarisonic Mia for her! It works so great, I am even thinking about getting one for myself! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Product is very easy to use. I have notice a difference in my complexion and have only used the product about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This little machine is everything it purports to be plus some!  I keep it in my shower and it hold the charge for a long time!</li>
    <li> I use the brush 2-3 times a week and noticed a difference in the texture of my skin almost immediately. This could be one of the best online purchases I have ever made!</li>
    <li> I have acne-prone skin and I use retin A, which makes my skin peel.  The Mia helps exfoliate and makes my skin much smoother.  Also, I feel like products penetrate my skin much easier.</li>
    <li> My Clarisonic died several months ago, unexplainably, and after the warranty expired.  I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement online except for the Mias, so I shrugged and bought this.  It works great, and I enjoy knowing my skin is that much cleaner every night!</li>
    <li> After I fell in love with my pink Clarisonic, I was thrilled to find the Mia mini for my 11 year-old daugther. I was able to get it in her favorite color. I have been teaching her how to take good care of her skin, and this was a perfect tool to get her started. She loves to use it.</li>
    <li> This thing is fantastic!! I leave it in the shower and use it everyday. I&#x27;ve stopped using almost all of my other skin care products. It&#x27;s all I need!</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift for my mother. I use one every day and she was so excited to get it and start seeing a difference in her pores. She loves this product and makes me a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 months and notice a big improvement of my skin. I am getting this one for my sister for her birthday.</li>
    <li> Happily received what i thought was a Clarisonic Mia a few months ago, looked just like the ones in Macys. I went to replace the brush and it had rusted inside. I called Clarisonic, since it was under warranty, and low and behold, the serial number printed on the device was not authentic, it is a fake. I spent over a $100 dollars for this, very upset!</li>
    <li> Although this product seemed great at first- made my face super clean and soft.  It stopped holding a charge and broke almost a year after I bought it.  Considering it is over $100, I would say it is NOT worth the money.  I contacted to seller to see if there was anything that can be done and they said that the warranty for their products is one month.  If I were you I would spend the extra $30 or so bucks and buy directly from Clarisonic so you can get their 1-2 year warranties.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this low quality product! It stopped working after a while. Contacted seller but no reply. Wasted my hard earned money on this POC.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Clarisonic for a year now and I&#x27;m very happy with the results! I have oily skin and it really helps me to thoroughly clean my pores. I always use deep pore cleaning replacement brushes for optimal result. Happy with it!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. I have wondered why it took me so long to purchase one. I have sensitive skin and I use the sensitive brushes and the results are amazing!! My skin has never looked this good! The best advice I would give is not to wait to purchase like I did. Go for it and enjoy the benefits of youthful skin!!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift, my daughter loves it! I&#x27;m an esthetician and several of my clients own these and love them as well. Great for acneic skin.</li>
    <li> I gave it a single star because it doesn&#x27;t allow you to give an item no stars. Basically-the item NEVER worked! The item didn&#x27;t charge. I read and re-read the instructions. Tried different outlets in the house and still no go. Finally called the Company and was told that it was defective. They didn&#x27;t seem surprised by that when I said the item was purchased from Amazon. Not sure what that was all about, but I returned the item. If I purchase another one, it will wont be from Amazon...</li>
    <li> I admit I was really nervous after reading all the &amp;#34;fake and fraudulent&amp;#34; warnings so first thing I did after receiving it was to register it online. It went through easily and I received a $25 coupon code for an order over $50. I purchased the turquoise Mia which is sold through Planet Beauty and so far it&#x27;s working perfectly. I charged it for 24 hrs before the first use and watched the care videos provided on Clarisonic. I can really tell a difference after using it for two weeks. My skin feels softer, firmer and my pores aren&#x27;t as obvious. I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed that it lasts and doesn&#x27;t stop working as quickly as others have stated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but I love it so far. The charger is magnetic (fun) and even though it&#x27;s just one speed, it&#x27;s the speed I wanted. The only thing I would change is that it doesn&#x27;t have the signal to tell you when to move on to the next facial area like the regular clarisonic, but I usually go a bit longer than the minute anyway.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a must for anyone with frequent breakouts. It leaves your skin feeling soft and CLEAN! I use it with CeraVe foaming face wash, which also a must-have product. After I clean my skin with the Clairsonic I use a toner and it is soaked in so much better because of the Clarisonic. After using the Clarisonic for a couple weeks I notice a huge improvement in my skin. The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars is because the battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged as long as I would like (but note- I use it at least twice a day) and the battery takes about 12 hours to charge. After getting used to the clean feeling after using the Clarisonic, I just feel gross when I can&#x27;t use it while waiting for it to charge.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this costs so much money or what benefits I&#x27;m receiving by buying this. First, when it came in the mail, the charging light didn&#x27;t work. Calls to the Clairsonic people resulted in friendly, but patronizing responses (\\&quot;you see, there&#x27;s just a little baby charge on it when it leaves our warehouse . . . \\&quot;) that were not accurate or helpful. The charging light never worked on the thing, which is irritating only because it costs so much money. I bought this because so many of my friends raved about it, but now that I have one I have no idea why anyone would rave about this. I have no visible improvement over my old washing regime and it&#x27;s a fun gadget, but really it just takes up space. Perhaps mine is just broken or something. Anyway, it&#x27;s an okay product, but if I could do it over again I would just save my money and keep on washing my face the regular way.</li>
    <li> It quit working by the second day. :( I have heard such great things about them, but this one just wouldn&#x27;t operate.</li>
    <li> My daughter really wanted this for Christmas, and she loves it, and it seems to be doing a great job on her skin, but I have no idea if it&#x27;s really any better than one of the $30 ones.  That said, it&#x27;s attractive, sits in the shower, and is getting used twice a day because she loves it so much, so I guess maybe it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I was told at the medical spa as well as some friends that this product was a must have. I do like it, however, I feel that my facial scrub cleans my face much better.</li>
    <li> I love the Clarisonic Mia.  I don&#x27;t see any reason to get the more expensive ones that have multiple speeds.  It&#x27;s perfect.  My complexion is much smoother and always feels so much cleaner.</li>
    <li> I love it and it makes my face feel and look cleaner.  It is supposed to help wrinkles and I have been using it for about ten days so I will know more about that later.  However, my face already looks better after I apply makeup.</li>
    <li> I usually use disposable wipes and gentle facial cleaning cream on my face.  But sometimes I&#x27;d notice areas where my foundation or other makeup stubbornly remained- and yet I didn&#x27;t want to be scrubbing my delicate skin all the time.  This product is perfect for what I needed.  Here&#x27;s what I like about it:  1)  its substantially made.  You&#x27;ll understand the cost when you feel the device in your hand.  2) does a great job of cleaning facial skin gently, and is especially suited for women who wear makeup, 3) Although this is a new product for me, I can easily see how other products will absorb into the clean skin better following (like Retin A products, moisturizer, etc)  4) fabulous way to charge the unit (via magnetic attachment), 5) I like that its waterproof and can even be used in the shower, which means it should last a LONG time when used outside of the shower!  Overall: I recommend, and think it will be especially good for anyone with thicker, more oily skin, or anyone who has to wear heavy or stage makeup.  I give it 4/5 stars only because even at Amazon&#x27;s better pricing, this item seems somewhat overpriced.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this cleansing system. I had my reservations about it but finally bought one. I love it. It really cleans your face good. I ended up buying one for each of my daughters.</li>
    <li> This is an overrated product the is very drying to the skin. Mine is relatively oily and flaked after using this product as directed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like if you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth with your finger for your whole life and just discovered a toothbrush.  I love it. I feel much cleaning and my skin is definitely softer.</li>
    <li> Item is listed as described. Would recommend to others. Works well and would buy again. Have no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I use it 2-3 times per week. I haven&#x27;t seen drastic results but it does help exfoliate and when I apply products they do seem to absorb better</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter and she loves it - she uses it everyday and her skin is clearing and brightening.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and uses it every evening. She says her skin is softer than ever. Great Xmas gift that keeps giving</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin and this product helped me on non-breaking out days to wash off the oiliness and make up better than sponges. I have to get a replacement brush. It fell skin softer and smoother when I use it. The only thing is you should not use it every day as it could be too irritating, as it says in the manual/instructions. I don&#x27;t own any cheaper versions of store brands and don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s significantly better, but I love it. It looks very sturdy can be used in shower, rechargeable and then the plug is taken out (magnetic) which is very cool.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Keeps my face nice and soft after washing. Only concern I might have is replacing the brush head.. Be sure you get a sensitive one if you have sensitive skin (like me)... Not necessarily oily or dry skin, but if you get the regular brush just know the bristles hurt.</li>
    <li> Gently exfoliates to leave a clean clear surface on your face. With daily usage I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement of my skin quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as part of my decade-long battle with ance. I&#x27;m 29 and I&#x27;ve had bad skin since I was in my early teens, and nothing helps, even drugs. This, however, FEELS wonderful on your face, and doesn&#x27;t get smelly like my washcloths always do (my bathroom is not well ventilated). It does lessen the amount of blackheads I get, and it makes my skin feel very clean, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not the miracle-worker other reviewers suggest.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews. And the one star is not for the Clarisonic Mia. The device itself is phenomenal and gives you glowing skin. But this Mia available through Amazon is NOT manufactured by Clarisonic and has not associated warranty. After 28 days of working properly, my Mia now turns on and off spontaneously all day and will not respond to being turned on or off manually. At 30 days exactly (when the Amazon return policy expires), the device stopped working at all. I spoke with a representative at Clarisonic today and she said my model number of the Mia I purchased is not made by them, so no warranty can be offered. Don&#x27;t go through what I did, just get a Clarisonic from either clarisonic.com, Sephora or Ulta.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price. The Clarisonic has much improved the texture of my skin, along with less breakouts. I LOVE it so much I even ordered one for my husband, and he loves it too! He said it softens his skin before shaving, he has less shaving related breakouts and we&#x27;ve both noticed our pores shrinking. Invest in a Clarisonic, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase. I bought the Turquoise one for myself (it&#x27;s very true to the color presented online), and Grey for my hubs.</li>
    <li> Starting hearing about this product from friends, and saw at Ulta store a few months ago.  Finally a good friend said she bought one and loved it, that it started improving her skin with first use.  We cycle together, so use a lot of sunscreen, and also we are middle-aged, so need some good cell stimulation.  She had had previous issues with breakouts, which left some scarring, pore exposure, and still has oily skin in some areas.  I purchased the Mia 2 for myself, even though my skin is dry and not prone to breakouts.  I have been using Noxema for several years, and thought I was perfectly fine with that. But with the Mia, I love the clean, but not scrubbed, feeling.  It helped clear debris collected in pores, making my skin feel softer and smoother. I still use Noxema occastionally, with or without the Mia 2.  I ordered one for each of my daughters, one who still suffers and occasional breakout and has oily skin.  She loves it!  My younger daughter has great skin, but sleeps without removing makeup, doesn&#x27;t cleanse immediately after workouts.  Then she complains about small whiteheads and blackhead in pores!  She loves it so much, and it is encouraging her to take better, more regular care of her skin.  Just recommended it to a friend who has perfect skin, hence the fourth purchase.  Like the Sonicare toothbrush, it is just a better way to clean pollutants from your skin and stimulate cell growth without being abrasive.  I think this is a great product for any type skin at any age.</li>
    <li> love it, use it everyday</li>
    <li> I love the Mia.  I truly see a difference in my skin when I use this versus just washing my face by hand.  I have acne and it does not seem to help with that, but it does improve the smoothness and feel of my acne-free areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY complaint is that it takes forever to charge.</li>
    <li> want to exfoliate your skin like no other?? use this!! plus i love the color. i can&#x27;t really say anything bad about this product. just be diligent about changing out your scrubber brushes or they will start to get stinky!</li>
    <li> I have genetically oily skin and have had acne since I was 13 (I am now 29).  This product is the best $ I have spent on skin care period.  I almost never review products, but I wanted to put it out there how worthwhile this purchase was.  I have tried creams &amp; face washes galore with limited to no success. Clarisonic changed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in the morning and at night with my regular face wash (either Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin face wash or Cetaphil) and I can feel the difference.  My skin feels smoother and I haven&#x27;t had a single obnoxious zit in the 1.5 months I&#x27;ve used it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat on the fence for over a year deciding whether to make this purchase.  I should have just bought it.  I now don&#x27;t have to hide behind concealer.  I dislike using much make-up and now I don&#x27;t have to.  Save the money on a year&#x27;s worth of make-up.  Buy this -- you won&#x27;t need all those expensive spot treatments going forward.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month. My skin is a bit smoother and the pores on my nose are less visible. I use the brush for sensitive skin since my skin tends to be delicate and prone to redness. Any improvement is a good thing for my 61 year old skin! I would have given this product 5 stars except that it is expensive to buy and the brushes are not cheap.</li>
