      <li>Love this brush for EVERYTHING will buy again.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>LOVE this for under eye setting powder.</li>
      <li>But I think I&#x27;ll use it as a highlight brush for highlighting the top of the cheekbones.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this brush while it lasted, it blended EVERYTHING beautifully like no other brush I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft and dense and I have experienced no shedding.</li>
      <li>And the bright color yellow is a plus because it is easy to find !</li>
      <li>If you have larger lid space, this is a great brush for crease work.</li>
      <li>This big eyeshadow brush is great.  </li>
      <li>Once again, Bdellium has produced a fantastic blending brush.  </li>
      <li>LOVED this eyeshadow brush sooo much until I washed it for the first time.</li>
      <li>you buy this, use brush shampoo to clean it.</li>
      <li>Fantastic brush and really quick delivery A+++++</li>
      <li>But I have found that it applies product across my whole lid so smoothly and easily.</li>
      <li>I love this brush, soft and full with virtually no shedding.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m considering buying another one in the future when I have more room to organize and store my makeup!</li>
      <li>The price is so reasonable, the shipment was sent out quickly!</li>
      <li>Reminds me of the paint brushes from elementary school used with tempra paint</li>
      <li>This brush is so reasonably priced and although I have not washed it yet I really feel you get more than your monies worth.</li>
      <li>very soft and cleans easily.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was quick since I had Amazon Prime, it took less than a week to receive which I was very pleased</li>
      <li>Too big for the crease, but great for overall diffusing of color.</li>
      <li>This brush it big and fluffy which makes it an awesome eyeshadow blending brush!</li>
      <li>This brush is a little large than I thought it would be but has actually worked out perfectly.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more of these brushes in the future.</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone willing to listen to me gush about them.</li>
      <li>definitely will recommend to anyone deciding to buy this! :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
      <li>I thought that I was blending my eyeshadows very well already until I used this brush!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of stunned at how having the right tool can make such an enormous difference.</li>
      <li>Dries fast.</li>
      <li>It is not the type of brush you would want for detail work--but for across the lid and crease work, I really like it.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this brush!</li>
      <li>The Bdellium brush has held up better than the other brushes</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>The brush is soft and very well made.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this brush for blending out any harsh lines in my makeup.</li>
      <li>But the reason I ordered was for my new bareminerals well rested setting powder.</li>
      <li>I love how soft it is and how fluffy.</li>
      <li>Is very soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave hairs all over.</li>
      <li>very soft and blends well.</li>
      <li>This brush is unbelievably soft!  </li>
      <li>This works really well for blending eyeshadow, especially in the crease.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m surprised how versatile it is.  </li>
      <li>It is really soft on your eyelid,  </li>
      <li>A little bigger than I thought it would be, but not bad.</li>
      <li>The brush is soft enough so that it&#x27;s not scratching your eyelid when applying your shadows, thinking of purchasing another one.  </li>
      <li>Love this to sweep an eyeshadow base over the eye very quickly</li>
      <li>Professional makeup artist Stephanie Lange recommended this for blending eyeshadow, and I don&#x27;t know how I lived this long without it.</li>
      <li>So disappointing considering I&#x27;ve bought other bDellium brushes before (the green bamboo eye set) and no dye ran off after washing and they work perfect</li>

    <li> Great price and brush</li>
    <li> Great brush. Really large, so not for small lids. Will buy more from this seller.</li>
    <li> A bit big.  Maybe when it gets softer with use will blend better.</li>

    <li> Good quality. I use as a blending brush for my eyeshadow. Love this. great price!</li>
    <li> Really great brush! If you have larger lid space, this is a great brush for crease work.</li>
    <li> Loooooooooove this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush is a little large than I thought it would be but has actually worked out perfectly. I use it to lay down my base eye shadow color and also to blend. The brush is soft and very well made. It washes well and i love the handles on these brushes. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and it arrived when they said it would. I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> This brush it big and fluffy which makes it an awesome eyeshadow blending brush! I use it everyday. And the bright color yellow is a plus because it is easy to find !</li>
    <li> Once again, Bdellium has produced a fantastic blending brush.  I use this for applying concealer as well as blending out my crease.  The bristles are soft and dense and I have experienced no shedding.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Perfect for blending.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a makeup artist&#x27;s beauty tutorial on YouTube. I had to get it. It&#x27;s vegan, the hairs are SO SOFT and it makes your eyeshadow look perfectly placed. Cut my eyeshadow time in half (I usually spend a lot of time perfecting my eyeshadow). Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush, love it. Great service too!</li>
    <li> This brush was a very pleasant surprise.  It is really soft on your eyelid,  blends eye shadows well and is well made.  I purchased this brush as the same time that I purchases brushes by MAC and Sigma.  The Bdellium brush has held up better than the other brushes and I prefer it to the other brushes.  I will be purchasing more of these brushes in the future.</li>
    <li> I want to order like 3 more of these bad boys. The price is so reasonable, the shipment was sent out quickly! So happy with the purchase!</li>

    <li> Was happy with it, did a good job until I used cinema secrets brush cleaner to clean it and it hasn&#x27;t been the same since. Became very scratchy and very difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this, use brush shampoo to clean it.</li>
    <li> Love this to sweep an eyeshadow base over the eye very quickly</li>
    <li> Love this brush it&#x27;s one of my favorites!! For the price this is a must have brush!!</li>
    <li> Works awesome. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a little hesitant at first about this brush because it is so much bigger than my other eye brushes.

    <li> I LOVE this brush for blending out any harsh lines in my makeup.</li>
    <li> Professional makeup artist Stephanie Lange recommended this for blending eyeshadow, and I don&#x27;t know how I lived this long without it. No longer does my makeup look streaky or smudgy. I&#x27;m kind of stunned at how having the right tool can make such an enormous difference.</li>
    <li> Color ran! Threw it in the garbage</li>
    <li> This brush is unbelievably soft!  I&#x27;m disappointed that the bristle-protector it came with is not reusable, but the brush itself is huge and very fluffy.  Great for blending out eye-shadow.  Too big for the crease, but great for overall diffusing of color.</li>
    <li> The brush is good for blending eyeshadow, but it is scratchy and shreds.  I wanted to use it for concealer, but it is too scratchy for under the eye.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick since I had Amazon Prime, it took less than a week to receive which I was very pleased about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the best brush for blending I have EVER HAD!! I thought that I was blending my eyeshadows very well already until I used this brush! My eyeshadow was blended perfectly with a gradient effect! I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering buying another one in the future when I have more room to organize and store my makeup! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most definitely will recommend to anyone deciding to buy this! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------U P D A T E-------------------&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED this eyeshadow brush sooo much until I washed it for the first time. After washing the black dye on the brushes kept running. So disappointed because now I don&#x27;t want to use this brush because of the dye getting all up in my skin. :( I really enjoyed this brush while it lasted, it blended EVERYTHING beautifully like no other brush I&#x27;ve used before. Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing another one of this. So disappointing considering I&#x27;ve bought other bDellium brushes before (the green bamboo eye set) and no dye ran off after washing and they work perfect that&#x27;s why I was reeallly bummed at how this brush turned out after washing.</li>
    <li> I will be purchasing some more of these brushes because they&#x27;re awesome and affordable!!! You will not go wrong trying these babies out!</li>
    <li> The brush is a really great brush for a great affordable price.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the paint brushes from elementary school used with tempra paint</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush and really quick delivery A+++++</li>
    <li> This brush was much bigger than I anticipated. So I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for my eyeshadow. But I think I&#x27;ll use it as a highlight brush for highlighting the top of the cheekbones.</li>
    <li> Very nice applicating and blending!</li>
    <li> It works awesome!!! Is very soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave hairs all over. Can&#x27;t wait to collect all brushes from this brand!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this for under eye setting powder. Not sure how I feel about this with liquid concealer because the concealer I tried it with was horrible. But the reason I ordered was for my new bareminerals well rested setting powder. This brush with that setting powder is AMAZING! Definitely recommend, and I have horrible bags! Not sure about shedding since I haven&#x27;t used it for too long.</li>
    <li> I loved it! I am going to recommend it to all my friends! I will surely be buying more bdellim products!</li>
    <li> This big eyeshadow brush is great.  I don&#x27;t have anything like it in my brush collection and I&#x27;m surprised how versatile it is.  I&#x27;m enjoying it a lot.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more brushes from the company.  I would recommend to anyone willing to listen to me gush about them.</li>
