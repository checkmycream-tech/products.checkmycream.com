<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So I received this product and used it to cut my sons hair. As soon as I used it, the small comb attachment broke. I contacted Philips Norelco customer service and after them basically telling me that there was a serial number where it wasn&#x27;t and that I was wrong and it was there, but It&#x27;s invisible or something, they finally said they would send me a replacement part. I waited close to a month and nothing came. So today I contacted customer service again and they told me that the device is out of warranty, even though I JUST bought it, but that they would be soooo nice and make a one time concession and send me a new part. Then they told me that it&#x27;s out of stock, and they have no idea when it will be back in stock, so I have to wait til some undetermined future date to see if the part EVER comes. So basically, I can&#x27;t use this product at all until who knows when. I&#x27;m really aggravated at this point and wish I had bought a different device from a different company so it might not have broken in the first place. Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I used the clipper to cut my son&#x27;s hair since he was only 3 mo old. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Loved this item - at first.  It IS very quiet.  The boys didn&#x27;t mind this one.  It is flexible enough to allow for a longer length on top than most clippers.  However, the plastic combs are very brittle and when you drop the clippers (and you WILL drop them), the combs will break (we have now broken both combs - several teeth on them).  No replacement combs are available - and I will not be buying another entire unit - too wasteful.  Tried the wahl peanut instead.  Not as adjustable, but much more sturdy.  Wish they sold replacements...</li>
    <li> We received this clipper last week and finally got to use it to cut my 5-year-old son&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s pretty straightforward to use and easy to clean.  The only thing I&#x27;d recommend is try not to cut the child&#x27;s hair when it&#x27;s getting too long because you&#x27;ll be surprised at how many hairs got stuck inside and in between the blades.  It&#x27;s quite handy that there was no need to charge the clipper prior to the first use.  It came in with somewhat charged already.</li>
    <li> My son has very curly, thick and coarse hair. I had let it grow to a little afro and the Philips Norelco CC5060 worked wonders on it. It cut through it pretty good without pulling on his curls. I had to put it on the longer length first then put it on the shorter length to get it to the length I wanted. Haircuts before with him were a 2 hour tramatic event because he was terrified of them. I got the Philips Norelco out and let him play with it and let him turn it on to show him that they would not hurt and they weren&#x27;t bulky like the old ones I had. He LOVED it! He also loved the &amp;#34;cape&amp;#34; that came with it. (he&#x27;s into superman so he thought that was awesome) He sat in his chair, watched his movie and let me cut his hair! It was WONDERFUL!!!! There was no crying, no holding him down, he sat there like a champ :) Will definitely recommend this to everyone I can.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for little boy&#x27;s hair. Easy to use, quiet, and cut very well. Would very highly recommend to anyone wanting to cut their little guy&#x27;s hair at home!</li>
    <li> The clippers claim to work on all hair types, but it did not cut my son&#x27;s tight-curly hair.  I was disappointed, because I really wanted kids&#x27; clippers to use on him.  I had to order an adult one from Wahl.</li>
    <li> I always wonder where to give my baby first hair cut and I never thought I can do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I did it! With this kids clipper! And I did a very good job!</li>
    <li> I use this on adults, it is easy to hold in my hand, the comb is soft so does not hurt the scalp and does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Very convenient, very suitable accessories, voice is very light, will not let the children feel afraid, very good, my husband feel good.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic little kit, I highly recommend it for the parent who is wanting to save some money and take on the task of giving their kids hair cuts on their own because it includes everything you need to get started, including a tutorial DVD and a cape. The pros for me are that it includes so much in one kit, that it&#x27;s cordless, low maintenance, easy to use, quiet, has strong power that lasts all through the hair cut, you can convert it back to using the cord if you need more time.  It&#x27;s the perfect size and fits comfortably in my hand, has all kinds of accessories with it and the style/color of it is very fun and inviting, not scary. There were no real cons for me considering the price and value of the kit.  The DVD is a little corny but it does give good basic information for those just getting started.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great - super-quiet and easy to use.  The tips are slightly rounded so there&#x27;s no accidental &#x27;stabbing&#x27; or scratching on a squirmy child, and they&#x27;re fairly light in your hand which is a plus.  The clipper comb tip is adjustable so you have multiple hair lengths to choose from, not just &#x27;short.&#x27;  The how-to DVD is a nice little bonus for those brave enough to venture on to hair-cuts beyond the simple buzz-cut.  Save yourself a trip to the hairdress and do it yourself at home - it&#x27;s easy and affordable!</li>
    <li> Although I am not a hair designer, I cut my child&#x27;s hair at home just to save a little bit of money; therefore, I&#x27;ve tried many different clippers and scissors. The usual problems I had with some clippers include product malfunctions, such as weak blades or poor product construction, in addition to noisy clippers which frightened my child and made it nearly impossible to trim his hair (and if you have children, you know how terrifying the entire haircut experience can be, not to mention a big messy, frustrating situation!!!  However, this clipper was different; it is maybe a little bit pricier than others, but it worked great for my son! We had a very smooth cut and my child didn&#x27;t complain at all. I don&#x27;t need to mention again all the wonderful features, but in addition to that, this has more than enough battery power and includes a very nice design for both parents and child. The product even came with a covering cloth for the child.  The only down side I have is that this clipper took long to recharge the battery, but again, once it charged, it had all the power you need and lasts very long as well.</li>
    <li> This was purchased because my 3 year old hates getting his hair cut.  This clipper is nice and quiet so he does not mind it at all.</li>
    <li> this is great for moms!.. it&#x27;s light and compact and very easy to use! :) no regrets buying this..     my son is 15 mths and i just sit in the bath-tub and distract him with his toys and shave away.</li>
    <li> Over the years we&#x27;ve been through countless clippers, Wahl, Oster, Andis, etc.  We bought this Philips while traveling once as we needed one and it was cheap.  After 4 or 5 years, these little clippers continue to work.  Not only do they work but they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to any of the above we&#x27;ve owned I would characterize the Philips as better designed, easier to clean, quieter, less vibration, better battery life and, judging from the life we get out of clippers, far more reliable.  They also cost us less than any of the other products.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says it should do.  I really like the slider height adjustment for how long the hair trim is.  Uses a rechargeable batter, with A/C charger (when necessary).  Comes with some nice additions too:  scissors, comb, apron, carry bag, etc.  I&#x27;d recommend for anyone who likes to cut their own child&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that we thought this was just the clippers.  It turned out to be clippers, two different clipper attachments, a clipper brush (to clean the clippers), scissors, comb, cape for putting over the kid to keep the hair off, a instructional DVD, and a carrying case.  I looked over the whole box and even the box doesn&#x27;t mention all the stuff inside.  The folks at Norelco really should mention all the goodies inside.    The clippers are really lightweight and quiet.  This is good because my son seems to have a lot of trouble sitting still, so we let him watch TV while getting a haircut and now we don&#x27;t have to have the TV volume blasting us out of the room. They are easy to hold which makes it easier to give haircuts for those of us not trained or practiced in the art of hair cutting.  The length adjustments are slightly curved and a bit flexible, which means less \\&quot;ow\\&quot;s from the hair-cutting subject if you press too hard.    Really, I have to say that I was genuinely surprised and pleased with the entire kit.  The only nitpick I have is that the battery charge time is a bit slow.  However, since it can be used plugged in or cordless, that really isn&#x27;t an issue.  I definitely recommend the kit.</li>
    <li> So these are clippers specifically geared towards kids, and more towards the Moms then the Dads.  With that in mind, what are you looking for when you are trying to decide if these are the clippers your kids will tolerate?  2 things, quietness and portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quietness - Check.  While I am not an expert on clippers, these clippers are indeed much quieter than any other clippers I have dealt with.  Kids do appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portability - Check.  These clippers are able to be used both corded and cordless.  You can sit your kids in front of the TV, makes life easier on both of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the things that matter to your kids.  Everything else is what matters to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, what I liked was that it was an entire haircutting kit, not just the clippers.  You also receive a DVD for basic instructions if you have never cut your kids hair before.  I also liked that it did what it was supposed to do.  It cut nicely, quickly, cleanly once you got the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were only a couple niggles, which while I don&#x27;t think either of them were huge, I would want people to be made aware of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  While you can use this cordless, it seems like it has a very long charge time.  You can&#x27;t just plug it in and an hour later you are ready.  Since haircutting isn&#x27;t an everyday activity, I truly don&#x27;t see this being an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  This is marketed towards the Moms, so translate that to mean smaller than most other clippers.  My wife is a taller woman with larger hands, and she joked that it was called a kids clipper because the kids were supposed to be the ones to use it.  Still, she really had no problems with it overall once she got used to it.  We agree that it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue unless you fall squarely on the larger size.  If that is the case, you might not feel comfortable with these particular clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t had the product long, so we can&#x27;t comment on long term how it holds up.  However, we have had other Norelco products in the past, and we are happy overall with Norelco as a company.  So, we don&#x27;t have any fears on that front.  Of course if that were to ever change, we would update this review to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we are very pleased with the product and glad that we got it, and recommend it to anyone who needs it.are happy overall with Norelco as a company.

    <li> I purchased this item because my 3-year-old hates getting a hair cut. He screams and moves. I assumed it was cause the clippers we were using scared him (with the sound, size and color.) I saw this clipper and thought...Cute color, small, no maintenance, and said to be quieter.  WELL...it&#x27;s NOT quieter.  In fact, it&#x27;s louder than the other one i was using. The different attachments fell off easily too.  I am assuming it was due to my son moving and shaking to avoid the hair cut. It does, however, give a good hair cut.  BUT like i said...if you are looking for a quieter clipper...this is not the one.</li>
    <li> My four-year-old son is a typical whirling dervish when I try to cut his hair (but he&#x27;s a little angel when I take him to a professional barber--go figure). In the past, when I&#x27;ve done the cutting, I&#x27;ve used the adult clippers that I use on my own head. So, I thought perhaps he&#x27;d be a little more accommodating if I were use something like the Philips model. Mmmn, not so much.    Just to make clear what I&#x27;m comparing the Philips model to: I use a Forfex clippers model on my own head; it cost about $120 or so, is rechargeable/cordless, and comes with lots of attachments. Before I owned that, I had a cheapo Wahl model, maybe $25; it had a cord, got very hot, and made loud zapping noises when I turned it on. My parents had one just like it when I was a kid, and I remembered being scared by that zapping.    The Philips model *is* quiet--but no quieter than the Forfex model. I&#x27;ll go out on a limb and say that most rechargeable clippers are going to be of similar quietness.    It is very nice that you only have to worry about two adjustment add-ons (the slide-on adapters that let you set the length of hair cut, from 1 inch to 1-3/4 inch with one adapter, and from 1/8th inch to 7/8ths inch with the other adapter). But the adapters seem pretty flimsy to me.    Furthermore, the product description talks about \\&quot;Rounded tips [that] protect skin and ensure a comfortable cutting experience,\\&quot; and that&#x27;s true, but only if you keep the adapters on. On the smaller adapter you can get down to 1/8th inch, and that sounds pretty close, but it didn&#x27;t get close enough around the ears. So, I removed the adapter to trim around the ears, and of course, when Junior did his Linda Blair imitation, I nicked him.     With the Forfex model I use, you can adjust the cutting depth without an adapter from 0.8mm to 2.8mm. On the Philips, without the adapter, I&#x27;d estimate that the minimum cut is about 0.8mm too--but you can&#x27;t adjust it any higher. The minimum cutting depth with the smaller adapter is 1/8th inch, which converts to about 3.0mm. So, you can either cut at 3.0mm and avoid nicks, or cut at 0.8mm and risk it--and nothing in between.    I do like that it&#x27;s a pretty nice kit, with the shawl (er, \\&quot;stylist&#x27;s cape\\&quot;), storage pouch, etc.      I realize that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not a fair comparison between a $40 product at a $120 product, but I did find other cordless/rechargeable products on Amazon in the same general price range--even one made by Philips: [[ASIN:B002C741NG Philips Norelco QC5055 Power Hair Clipper]]. Perhaps they&#x27;re not *quite* as kid-friendly, but I don&#x27;t think the difference is huge.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a good product, but wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be great. So far it&#x27;s wonderful. It really is quiet, does an even job, and it&#x27;s easy for me to use (I&#x27;d never really cut hair before). You can use it with or without a cord, and it has a lot of different attachment settings. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Previously I used a uni-age, uni-sex clipper I had bought at Walmart or Target to cut my preschooler&#x27;s hair.  It worked ok, but was rather noisy, got hot quickly, and I had to constantly change the clip-on guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco Kids Hair Clipper is a much better tool, and makes cutting my kid&#x27;s hair relatively easily. First of all, it&#x27;s both corded and cordless, so you get a nice choice, especially one you can&#x27;t find a wall outlet close enough. In cordless mode, the built-in LiIon battery (which does not suffer from the dreaded and hated \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; like NiCad batteries used in many cheap consumer appliances) gives you about 30 minutes of cutting time, after charging it for 8 hours. Very convenient, since it&#x27;s unlikely your kid will sit still for more than 30 minutes anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is not silent, but it&#x27;s quieter than the clipper I used before, so this is another big plus. It helps not only because I hated the buzzing sound, but since my kid likes to watch Dora or SpongeBob or Haier Brothers when I cut his hair, the quiet motor makes his TV watching more enjoyable, and I don&#x27;t need to crank up the TV volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a clipper this one is pretty easy to use. It comes with two adjustable guide combs that gives you a total of 15 lock-in lengths. One guide is for hair 1 inch or longer, and the other for hair between 1/8\\&quot; and 7/8\\&quot;. It&#x27;s easy to slide each guide comb onto the clipper itself, and also easy to select a desired length (all is explained clearly in the included DVD video). Compared to my old clipper kit which had something like 10 or 11 guides, now I need not worry about losing one of those guides. The tips are a little rounded so they&#x27;re safer for kids, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is small and light-weight, therefore quite easy to operate, especially on a fussy kid. It also looks quite stylish, thanks to its European design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the kit comes with a pair of scissors, a styling comb, a pouch, a cape, an AC adapter, and a DVD that introduces the clipper as well as gives you some pointers on how to cut a kid&#x27;s hair; be sure to watch the how-to-use chapter so you don&#x27;t need to read the user-unfriendly instruction sheet.

    <li> This is much more than just a clipper - it&#x27;s a hair cut kit.  It includes some decent scissors, a \\&quot;cape\\&quot; to catch the cut hair, a comb, cleaning brush, carry pouch, and instructions DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting hair is quite simple and pays off very quickly, but you should first consider if you are a DIY type and willing to risk perhaps less than the perfect hair cut for your kids, your spouse, etc.  The first few hair cuts will take 20-30 minutes as you figure out how much to take off and where.  Alternatively, you can also start out with a trim here and there so you can stretch out your visits to the barber or salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons why I think it is significantly better than other products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Cordless makes a HUGE difference.  Finding a place to cut hair is tricky enough without having to make sure you have an outlet nearby.  Also, cords can be clumsy when you&#x27;re trying to get the right angle on the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This Clipper is very light and 3/4 the size of regular clippers.  This makes it better suited for smaller hands but also more maneuverable - easier to get the right angle on the clippers to the comb.  Downside is that the cutting path is about 1/4\\&quot; narrower than \\&quot;regular\\&quot; clippers but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Flexible / Adjustable guide comb.  Most other clippers have a series of rigid guide combs that snap on.  This has one comb that adjusts from 1/8\\&quot; to 7/8\\&quot; and another that goes from 1\\&quot; to 1-3/4\\&quot;. This means you don&#x27;t have to switch from one comb to another - just click over to the next setting.  Just as importantly the guide comb also has a nice flex to it which makes it glide much more smoothly over their head and rounded corners so you don&#x27;t gouge their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Lithium Ion battery - makes it quite powerful and lightweight at the same time.  It also means that after charging it holds that charge for a while so you&#x27;re always ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars.  I guess I was disappointed by the DVD.  The video and the packaging came across as strictly for a mother to cut their son&#x27;s hair.  The DVD only included info on how to do 3 types of hair cuts on boys.  However, I&#x27;m a guy and have cut my daughter&#x27;s hair, my wife&#x27;s hair and my own.  I&#x27;d have liked more information on how to do other hair cutting techniques including how to do some simple girls haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received this item free through the Amazon \\&quot;Vine\\&quot; Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please let me know!video and the packaging came across as strictly for a mother to cut their son&#x27;s hair.

    <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have any kids to practice hair cutting on but I got this for my cat, he&#x27;s extremely afraid of loud devices but manages to make a real mess and tangle his silky Persian fur all the time. The cutter is lightweight but quiet in comparison to the  cutters in the store, it also has rounded tips that make it less scary to use. The cape was a neat add on, gives a place to catch the cut fur/hair and the dvd, well I checked it out and was impressed that someone would take the time to make a manual, if I had to give a little boy a hair cut I would be bale to do a good job and save money in the long run, after all hair grows fast and one can barely keep up with the cutting.    I got the grooming done, who says you can&#x27;t use this and on top of it all my cat was happy since he loves short hair in the summer. It took a long time but I got the job done.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these clippers.  For several years now, haircut time was terrible for our 4 year old son and for us.  The big noisy clippers scared him and made him twist, turn and try to get away as fast as possible.  These clippers did the trick.  They are much quieter than other clippers and small enough for him to hold and get used to.  I recommend letting your little one watch the DVD included with the clipper kit.  Our son liked the superhero cape and watched as kids his age on the DVD got their haircut without any problems.  Great product.</li>
    <li> my 2year old now 3 year old son hates getting his hair cut, we tried bringing him to places and keep entertained, we tried using scissors and cutting his hair in his sleep and nothing worked...he was so scared or the buzzer...so we came on the website and had him pick out one the \\&quot;he wanted to get\\&quot; so that we could cut his hair..and he picked this one..when it came in he at first cried but when he realized how quiet and how it does hurt at all, he now let us cut his hair no problem!    Only down fall it that you have to go over the same spot a few times to get all the hair and every now at then leaves a longer hair some where, but that&#x27;s when the best part of the product comes in, the portability and cordless, if I see the long hair or a spot I missed I get it and just buzz it right then and there, even when he in outside playing..    Over all glad I got the product makes my life less stressful</li>
    <li> Perfect for: Cutting kids hair (and adults too)    Includes: How-to dvd, instructions, carrying case, comb, scissors, cleaning tool, two clipper guides that clip onto the clippers (one for cutting hair from 1/8 inch to 7/8 inch, also shown in 3-21 mm, the other for cutting hair from 1 inch to 1 3/4 inch, or 24-42 mm), the actual clippers, charging cable/plug, apron    In a Nutshell: This was an easy-to-use system right out of the box.  A few things I loved about the Norelco kids clipper - it comes with a great apron that helps keep the cut hair off your child, making clean-up much easier when you have a kid who barely sits still long enough for you to cut their hair in the first place.  Another plus - the clipper guides - they are easy to use/adjust, they are slightly flexible which makes cutting a little easier, and the edges are rounded, which reduces the ability of poking an ear or other facial feature.  Finally, the clipper itself is great - it is a good size to hold in your hand, is lightweight, has the ability of being charged ahead of time for cordless use, or use with a cord for use any time.  I do wish I could store the dvd in the carrying case, but the opening isn&#x27;t quite large enough to fit it inside.    Overall - this is a great new system that makes cutting your kids (or an adults easy cut) hair at home easier!  Don&#x27;t forget to add a cartoon or movie to keep your child&#x27;s attention focused on one place for a longer amount of time.</li>
    <li> Honestly, these are just clippers that are packaged for children and the \\&quot;Mom\\&quot; that cuts the hair.  I found that a bit offensive because it seriously advertises and is geared towards \\&quot;Moms\\&quot;.  In our case, my husband was going to be using them on our 3 year old son; he wasn&#x27;t offended but it bothered me that in this progressive society where both parents share in the responsibility of a household and yes, even haircuts they would eliminate 50% of their advertising market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the performance... it truly is a regular clipper at the end of the day.  It&#x27;s saving grace is the DVD that comes along as a tutorial.  There is an introduction and how to keep your child comfortable &amp; in some cases tips on keeping them calm.  Then we are presented with three different(covers all ethnicities/hair types) \\&quot;Mothers\\&quot; and their respective offspring.  You will have a tutorial on a buzz cut, long styles and curly hair.  The DVD made it a lot more understandable and less nerve-wracking for someone venturing out on their own for the very first time.  Yes, the DVD can be a bit corny &amp; cute; especially in the intro when they fast forward the Mom and have her pulling an \\&quot;Edward Scissorhands\\&quot; on her son.  Our son loved the video and kept on nagging us to restart it which I guess can be a positive LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive:&lt;br /&gt;The tutorial DVD!!&lt;br /&gt;The blue cape to keep the hairs off&lt;br /&gt;Hair comb&lt;br /&gt;Scissor for longer hair styles&lt;br /&gt;Brush for the clippers&lt;br /&gt;Being able to convert to wired when batteries run low&lt;br /&gt;Pouch to keep all of these components together for next use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative:&lt;br /&gt;The blue guide clipper bends in the center leaving two hard points stabbing and slowly rubbing up and down the scalp. (Painful according to my Husband)&lt;br /&gt;Charge time is 10 hrs for about 45 mins.  When starting out, that is just not long enough for a nervous parent.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged just for mothers... believe it or not many Dads actually cut their sons&#x27; hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is just an ordinary clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for those that do not have any other experience with clippers because you would highly benefit from the tutorial DVD.  When you become savvy, ditch it for better ones that do not have bending guides.have any other experience with clippers because you would highly benefit from the tutorial DVD.

    <li> I am by no means a hair cutting expert; in fact I have never used a hair clipper before.  When this one said it was ultra quiet I was excited to try it out.  My son is 2 and we usually take him to a kids hair place to have his hair cut.  He always gets a faux-hawk; shaved on the sides and back and a bit longer on the top-middle of the head.  He really doesn&#x27;t like it when they use the hair clippers on him at the hair place but we are usually able to distract him with toys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this clipper worked great on him.  It is very quiet and cordless.  He didn&#x27;t mind it one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with what a complete set this was.  It comes with a bag, two guides, scissors, a brush to clean out the hair clippers, a comb, a how-to DVD, and a sheet to try around your neck to keep the hair off.  We loved that it was wireless, it was super easy to use and very quiet.  The only drawback was that the guides were made out plastic and felt kind of flimsy to me; the guides were also kind of tough to move up and down and change.  Besides that small quip; I think it is a great product...and with a bit more practice I can easily cut my son&#x27;s hair at home.  Only drawback to that is my son doesn&#x27;t get a lollipop and cool color spray on his hair when I do it at home :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very complete set, with everything you need to cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Cordless&lt;br /&gt;- Nice case for travel&lt;br /&gt;- Very quiet&lt;br /&gt;- Very Adjustable for different hair lengths&lt;br /&gt;- How to DVD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Guides felt flimsy and were kind of hard to change/adjust&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked this hair clipper and I am sure it will get lots of use around our house.</li>
    <li> What i love most about this clipper is that you dont have 10 different sized snap on length adjusters but only two. There are two that slide on that give you all the lengths you need and it clearly showed it written on them how many MM they are. there&#x27;s 3MM-42MM in 3 MM increments. so you can choose 3, 6, 9, 12, etc...mm very cool and you dont have to worry about losing one, which is a problem i have had. as far as the noise it is a little less noisy than other clippers ive used but not by much. my son doesnt have problems with the bussing noise so it didnt really matter to me. overall i really like these clippers and my husband uses them also. they do a great job and best of all you dont need to oil these. it comes with a nice little blue pouch that holds everything plus a little cape to keep the hair off your clothes. good overall buy that includes everything you need to make great buzz cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: ive owned these clippers for about 4 months now and they are amazing. i have never once cut somebody using them which did happen time to time with regular ones. that alone is worth it as i dont have to worry about nicking my 5yo and causing pain. great great clippers, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco CC5060 is intended to be a home haircut kit for kids, but the entire package actually works fairly nicely for most of your family&#x27;s touch up needs.  First off, what you&#x27;re getting with this set is a fairly comprehensive package of tools that holds up nicely for simple hair touch ups. Everything from the clipper, a charging kit, a carrying case, scissors and a well produced instructional DVD.  The clipper is cordless (but also can be used wired) making it a great option for those who prefer to get the job done outdoors.  Being a &#x27;kid&#x27; friendly product the device runs relatively quiet and has a gentler feel to it which providing most of the power you&#x27;d expect to buzz down a scruffy mop along the sides and back.  The only downside I experienced was the 5 or 6 hours to get this product fully charged up.  Other than that, this kit makes for a great option especially for those of you looking to DIY on your kids.</li>
    <li> Have a very sensory sensitive kid and had high hopes for this.... its ok. Better than any other clippers we have tried. I like the size and that its cordless. Glad to have it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a fully charged-up battery can last many months. works very well me. I have since bought another 2 to give it to my sister and sister in law.</li>
    <li> Could not get it to cut my baby&#x27;s fine hair and it is not really quiet compared to my other more powerful clipper.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I bought these clippers. I was a little hesitant to buy them based on what the few negative reviewers said. We used them on our three year old son last night and I am so impressed. He was terrified of our last set of clippers. They were painful and loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His haircut with this set of clippers turned out so nice. At first he was terrified of getting his haircut. We had to kind of hold him against his will to start. But as soon as my husband started swiping the clippers through his hair he relaxed and started having a good time. He let us do the whole haircut while he talked and talked. He said the new clippers were nice ones and he wanted to keep them in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband cuts my sons hair and I was afraid this set would be awkward for him since its a smaller design for ladies hands but it wasn&#x27;t awkward at all. I highly recommend these clippers to anyone who is looking for a nice set but is unsure what to buy. If you are extremely picky and are used to very high end clippers you will probably find something wrong with these clippers, but I honestly can&#x27;t understand how anyone could find any reason to complain about this set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~ Very quiet. Sound is comparable to, but slightly louder than an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;~ Lightweight for easy maneuvering and control.&lt;br /&gt;~ Cordless. Gives you the ability to cut anywhere you want, even outside, and to move freely.&lt;br /&gt;~ Self sharpening blades and uses no blade oil.&lt;br /&gt;~ Instructional DVD for a true novice hair cutter.&lt;br /&gt;~ Comb tips are designed very well with rounded tips and plastic that has some give, which provides extra comfort.&lt;br /&gt;~ Charge indicator light tells you when unit is fully charged, also when there is only enough power left for one haircut.&lt;br /&gt;~ Accessories: Nice quality. Scissors, cape, comb, blade brush, adjustable guides, instructional DVD, and nice storage case.&lt;br /&gt;~ Versatile and inexpensive. This unit is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> im a 30yr male who cuts my own hair every 3weeks.  I found this to be a great replacement for my wahl clippers that used to have up # 1-14 for guards. After much research this was one of the very rare clippers that had it.   Its quiet and works really well.    even tho its for a child, it will work perfectly for adults as well. i am very pleased w the quality and cut of the clippers.    Im going to buy 2 just incase they discontinue this clipper in the near future!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for a handful of times on our infant since he was 6.5 months old. He has a lot of hair so it&#x27;s made haircuts sooo much easier having this tool! I can finish a cut in 10 mins! The cuts come out clean, straight. I get lots of compliments on his haircut. The noise is very very subtle. He tends to keep loking around to see what that noise is but is not scared by it. The clipper itself is easy to clean with the brush that is provided in teh kit.  The cap is good but since he is still little with a skinny neck so the cap doesn&#x27;t wrap tightly around hit. Litle hairs still go down the neck but we just give him a bath afterwards so no real issues.   Love it and have been recommending it to other moms. We&#x27;re saving $ by cutting it ourselves and it&#x27;s a fun bonding experience! I gave it 4 starts because the price is a little steep compared to other more fancy units out there. HOwever since this is really the only one fit for little kids and really easy to use, it&#x27;s been worth it for us.</li>
    <li> My four year-old son has autism, and he normally screams and cries through a hair cut. I came across these and read good reviews so I decided to try and see how it works. Simply amazing! He didn&#x27;t cry once (for the first time in 3 years), in fact he was smiling at times! I highly recommend these clippers for children who are sensitive to loud noisy clippers!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got cute colors , comes with some accessories and a storage bag ,but it is only a tiny bit quieter than my regular cordless Norelco clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i have some time i will test the sound levels from both clippers with sound meter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about these is that they are pretty sharp.</li>
    <li> This clipper is just great for my 15 month old.  I had never cut anyone&#x27;s hair before but was so tired of paying $20 every 5 or 6 weeks for a hair cut for my son and they never really got it how I wanted it.  I can&#x27;t say that within the first few times I got it exactly how I wanted it either, but it did come out really good.  I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others as this is the only one I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m certainly happy with it.  It is not very loud...just a little buzz sound.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> People who don&#x27;t have cats (or dogs) will think this is really weird, but sometimes you have a pet who needs a little help keeping clean  under the tail.  This clipper is small, gentle, and quiet enough that our elderly Maine Coon cat and his arthritic  half-brother don&#x27;t mind getting their &#x27;tender bits&#x27; trimmed.  It&#x27;s very light and easy to hold onto, also.  I imagine it would be great for small dogs, too.</li>
    <li> Its okay not the best set of clippers. all my kids say it pulls their hair ... Not a good thing when you have   one child who has SD ...</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer. Does the job FAST and child safe. The child-friendly add-on eliminates fears for hurting the kid (mine is 13 months and has no ability to sit still). There were some complains regarding its inability to cut hair near the ears. That is true. However scissors are included so we just cut hair near ears. We love that the set includes anything you might need to cut the hair. Although I did not watch the disc. But there is also a bag to hold all those hair trimming accessories.  We have used the item once and so far we are confident it is well worth the money we paid for.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to try out the [[ASIN:B002C741NQ Philips Norelco CC5060 Kids Clippers]]. My son is now 17, but for the last 13 years I have paid a barber on average $15 every other month to cut his hair. (Yikes - Do the math!) And it&#x27;s not like it is a difficult cut. He uses a #4 guide all over and then the sides and back with a #2 guide. It takes them about 5 minutes to finish it.  I did try for many years to get him to sit for me and let me do it, but between the loud sound of the clippers and just not being comfortable with \\&quot;Mom\\&quot; doing his hair I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had received the clippers, charged it up and watched the DVD, my son says to me \\&quot;Hey, can we cut my hair?\\&quot;  So I did, actually we both did. We went out onto our deck (because it&#x27;s cordless!) and before I could get him in a chair he had the clippers set to the length he wanted, turned on and he was running it through his hair!! Instead of freaking out, I just watched as he proceeded to give himself a mohawk. Eventually he asked for my help with the back, both in cutting and cleaning up his neckline. And in the end (about 20 minutes from start to finish) my son had his hair cut and I had saved myself a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;~ Cordless: I really think this is great! It allows for easy movement around the head without getting tangled up and doesn&#x27;t limit you on where you can be.&lt;br /&gt;~ Quiet: Much quieter than all the other clippers we&#x27;ve tried. This is nice for small kids.&lt;br /&gt;~ Nice Power: I allowed it to charge fully before our first use and didn&#x27;t notice a drop in power the entire time we were using it.&lt;br /&gt;~ Accessories: DVD had great tips and suggestions, scissors &amp; comb for evening things up, 2 adjustable guides with 15 settings, small blade brush for cleaning, soft velcro storage pouch and a stylist cape like you find in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;~ Adjustable Guides: Although I love these because they allow many different size settings in just 2 guides, we did have trouble switching from one to the other and also sliding the guide up and down to adjust. In a way this is probably good as you really don&#x27;t want the guide to accidentally change half way through a cut, but we were afraid of breaking them as hard as we had to be on them. Maybe it&#x27;s just a flaw on our set?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very nice set that I would have loved to have had when my son was younger, but even now at his age it suits us fine. I look forward to saving money by no longer having to visit the barber and if your curious....Yes he still has the mohawk.sliding the guide up and down to adjust.

    <li> I have a child with severe Autism, haircuts are a nightmare..but a must. I was skeptical about purchasing these clippers but said it can&#x27;t hurt. Charged them just like they said, 8 hrs, proceeded with the haircut. Usually he cries horribly at the sight of them, &amp; the sound makes matters worse, I have to hold him down just to get each corner. &amp; it breaks my heart. It took hours for one haircut. But with these, I turned them on &amp; put them on his hair next to his ear &amp; he just sat there. I was amazed!!! It took 15 mins &amp; I was done, no fighting, no crying.. Complete silence. I was stunned! Now, these do still make noise but very low vibrate like sound. Thank you makers of this wonderful, life changing product! Very much recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used normal clippers on my one year old and he hated it. So I saw these and had to get it. My one year old had no idea I was cutting his hair. I love them,+ They cut well too. Great product!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; REVISED&lt;br /&gt;I ONLY USED THEM ONCE OR TWICE AND HAVE NOW GOTTEN RID OF THEM.  They never stayed chargedand after one cut the blades seem dull.  just a waste now!</li>
    <li> Great for my little baby.  Wont cut him</li>
    <li> My 4 year old is autistic and having his hair cut is a traumatic event. These are quiet, easy to use and work well. Made hair cutting time much easier for everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper in May expecting to use it for my infant son who is now a year old.  Well, we just now could bring ourselves to cut off his curly locks, so we finally got out the norelco kids trimmer.  Unfortunately, with the attachment comb on it wasn&#x27;t even beginning to cut his hair.  As we continued to try coming at the hair from different angles and using the comb to feed the hair into the attachment, we realized we weren&#x27;t going to get his hair cut with this product.  We ended up using the Wahl I use to cut my husband&#x27;s hair which worked with no problem (the fact that it was louder didn&#x27;t bother my son).  However, making the hair-cutting ordeal longer by trying and failing with this trimmer caused my son to lose his patience and made finishing his hair cut quite a nightmare...      Since I bought the trimmer too soon before we used it, it was too late to take it back to Amazon or to get the 45 day money-back guarantee.  I watched the how-to video just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t doing something wrong and found out that their recommendation for curly hair is to not use any of the attachments and just use a finger to measure and keep the haircut even.  Have they ever tried doing that with a wiggly 1 year old?  Besides, I might as well use scissors in that case.  I also talked to customer service just to make sure there wasn&#x27;t something they could do for me and the guy I talked to told me this trimmer was not recommended for curly hair.  Well, it would have been nice to know that before purchasing - I suppose it was my fault for not trying it soon enough so I could take it back though.  I guess I will stick to Wahl products from now on.</li>
    <li> not as quite as I expected. however it is easy to use. and came with a lot of things in a nice handy case</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t completely silent like it was advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers for my 3 year old son who has very curly and fine hair. After using them one time I had to request a refund because the guide has left my son&#x27;s hair uneven. I did not intend to give him a low cut but after the clippers cut the front of his head extremely short I had to take him to a barber to fix it. I&#x27;m not a professional which is why I depended on the guide to give a even cut. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper because my son is terrified of getting his hair cut. We just could not handle one more trip to the hair salon (for kids) and have to see him scream and cry again. Although this clipper is not as silent as I expected, I do love the attachments enabling us to cut the hair at varying lengths and the clipper does glide very well and follows the hair line. It took a couple of days to get the whole head done (had to get someone to restrain him) but it was much easier than having someone else do it and I really think he will get used to it over time.</li>
    <li> If your 2 year old is like mine, he won&#x27;t sit still and is very squirmy when its comes to hair cuts! These clippers are quiet and get the job done quickly and efficiently! The instructional video is very cheesy but helpful for simple classic cuts. This product is worth every penny, and I will be purchasing another one for a fellow friend with a toddler.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my son 9month old was terrified of the noise from the Wahl clippers...&lt;br /&gt;so i purchased this because it&#x27;s suppose to be quieter... doesnt make a difference my son is still terrified... and its a slower cutter than the wahl...&lt;br /&gt;atleast the wahl clippers gets the job done faster...</li>
    <li> Just cut my kid&#x27;s hair with the clipper. I&#x27;ve cut his hair with scissors several times, but this is the first time I use a clipper. The clipper comes charged (just about right for one haircut), and it is super easy to use. I am not a Pro and my kid&#x27;s new hair style comes out great. :) My little one is sensitive to loud noise, but the clipper is not loud so even when I use it around his ears he is fine with that. I would definitely recommend this item.  P.s. I did not use the guides because my kid&#x27;s hair is kind of long.</li>
    <li> Excellent for African hair, the tutorial that comes with it is helpful. It was my first time to use a clipper and everyone was happy with the results they couldn&#x27;t believe how well the hair cut came out.</li>
    <li> We have disabled sun with rare genetic decease. Cutting his hair was the major battle as he was frightened by noisy machines bought on local market, usually faked products from China (we already tested at least three different models). I decided that enough is enough and we should search for solution elsewhere. After researching on Amazon we finally selected the child friendly model (CC5060 Kids Clipper) from Philips Norelco. We were first indeed disappointed to see that shipped product was again \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot;. But this was our last disappointment. Alexander (our sun, he cannot speak and cannot understand anything but only when he is served good meal) immediately fell in love with the machine. He was actually asking us to cut his hair imitating movement of the clipper around his head. It took us just 5 minutes to complete his haircut down to 0 mm. Machine never jammed in quite thick hair cover he has. Now we were able to bring him into bath again, cleaning his head without any straggle and screaming, which was usual practice for us, happening at least once in a week. And in the past we never ventured to shampoo him twice! This day was indeed celebration in our family. Thank you Philips and China, you solved at least two of our many problems! Obviously I can enthusiastically recommend this product to any child - if it worked with Alexander, it will work for anyone!.. RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> We owned these for about two years (until one of the guards broke).  I used the heck out of them before the break and saved SOOO much money on hair cuts for my two sons and my husband.  I told my husband to pick up a new one at Target, but he got a Wahl!  I am not happy with the Wahl clippers at all.  I have now been using the Wahl clippers for about a year and DO NOT like them.  The Wahls are so clunky.  The Norelco kids&#x27; clipper was so light.  The Wahl guards scrape and poke.  The Norelco kids&#x27; clippers have rounded edges, so the kids (and the husband) don&#x27;t get scratched.  The Wahls have a cord.  The Norelco didn&#x27;t.  The Wahls needs oiled.  The Norelco didn&#x27;t.  Even the scissors and cape that came with the Wahls suck.  I actually had to take out the cape and scissors from the Norleco set and put them in my Wahl case.  I don&#x27;t care that the Wahls still work.  I will be buying the Norelco kids&#x27; clippers again soon!  Even if a guard breaks every two years from the many uses in our family, it still beats a crummy hair clipper that&#x27;s a pain to use that may or may not last longer (and it still beats the cost of one hair cut for each of the guys in the family).</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a clipper that was quiet and soft on my son&#x27;s head.  He has autism and haircuts have been an issue, to say it nicely!  This clipper is awesome and my son doesn&#x27;t mind it all. He sits and even relaxes while I buzz away!  I bought another to have as a backup!</li>
    <li> It was perfect for a women who never cut hair. Used on father in nursing home which ment I could keep him groomed anytime I thought he needed a hair cut instead if waiting for a barber to come to the nursing home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 6 haircuts now, on my 2 kids (4 and 7).  It&#x27;s good enough to not return, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- If your child is very sensitive to noise, this is definitely a lot quieter than average hair trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;- I like that it&#x27;s battery powered, and you can take it anywhere.  It can also be operated with the cord, which is critical when you don&#x27;t want to take the time to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;- I really like the fact that there&#x27;s 2 trimmer length attachments that provide adjustability, without having to snap on and off different attachments.  If you&#x27;re going from very long to very short, you might need to use both of them, but you may also be able to get away with just using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- It just doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the regular clippers.  It has a wimpy motor, and you sometimes have to press the hair against the trimming edge to make it cut.&lt;br /&gt;- I frequently have to blow away the hair from the trimming edge - sometimes every time I make a pass through the hair.  With regular trimmers, the cut hair just seems to fall away without needing to be blown away.&lt;br /&gt;- The cutting edge is narrower than a regular hair trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- Because of the above 3 points, it takes longer to cut the hair.</li>
    <li> I use this on my son who is almost two. Works pretty well as long as he is not moving around too much. Comes with everything you need to give a decent hair cut. My son was not afraid of this cutter, more of a interest on this strange buzzing device floating around his head. It holds on to the charge pretty well, I just charge it the night before I&#x27;m going to use it for best results.  My only gripe is the guides are kinda weak, and have a lot of flex to them if you&#x27;re using the longer guide. Also they can slip into a shorter setting if you are not careful. Hopes this helps.  Another nice thing is I can save a lot of money doing this myself versus paying someone else to do, then having to repeat every time my son gets scruffy ;-)  Happy Hair Cutting</li>
    <li> Went well with my son. It took a while for him to get used to it, but once he did, the hair-cut went smoothly.</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t cut hair regularly at home. There are times, where you need some thing to trim the hair and dont have time to wait in the barber shop. This one comes in very handy. A good work horse and reliable tool. It holds charge for a long long time. Once you charge it overnight, it will be ready to use for weeks at a time. It comes for several hair cuts. Especially good for toddlers who wont patiently sit and show their head for hair cut. Never bother cutting hair with scissors. This one is money well spent. I think this one is a must have for every family.     It makes cutting hair a easy job. You have a higher chance of cutting hair straight without creating patches here and there. Set it up to your desired length and it gets the job done. Very well designed and manufactured product. Designed very ergonomically, easy for both large and small hands.</li>
    <li> It is just like what other customers reviews. It is easy to use and i do not need to worry to hurt my baby&#x27;s scalp.</li>
    <li> Great Philips&lt;br /&gt;Very easy use and very easy to operate. I see the instruction this clipper can have several different hair cut. but I am still seeking how to make it. great</li>
    <li> We bought this clipper a year ago via Amazon. And just like many have said it is very QUIET, gentle, and on a single charge we usually manage three hear-cuts, spaced about 6 months apart.  Our toddler is a VERY active child. The only time he&#x27;s still is when he&#x27;s having his bath. So that&#x27;s when we usually trim his hair. - To make the long stories short, twice the CC5060 clipper dove into the tub full of water, and after we&#x27;d get it out, we&#x27;d simply dry it, and... continue off with out work. Afterwards we&#x27;d just leave it on a cloth to dry.... And to this day it still works without any issues!  Definitely a 5 star, and fully recommended!</li>
    <li> Well made product. Quieter than usual trimmers and comes with everything you need for hair cut. There is a instructional DVD also included</li>
    <li> I love it! Is easy, faster, have all the necessary, my mom like one... She is expert in these business...</li>
    <li> I used it to give my son his first haircut as I thought that the comfort of our home would be less traumatic than some unknown place.&lt;br /&gt;I put him on his high chair, give him my Ipad and it only took me 10 min to get it done. I used to do my brothers hair as a teenager. I was able to keep some of his long locks on top and clear his neck and around his ears. It is very quiet and safe if your child moves around. Great buy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, light weight cordless .   Recommend for child hair-cut. Battery life  Is seem good too.   need to find out later. That&#x27;s all I can say now</li>
    <li> Not as the description it has more choices of hair length of 40+ mm. it works well and we feel very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product! Quiet and easy to use and perfect for my 2 year old! No issues. Highly recommended for kids</li>
    <li> Since the product introduction shows that it is Ultra Quiet, I bought it for my 4 month old boy. I found that the noise is  even bigger than the adult philips clipper i had. I do not know if there is some problem of my ordered one. I have not compared it to the same products other people had.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old autistic son struggled with haircuts.  He would cry and avoid them at all costs. It was an ordeal no one wanted to go through.  I bought this product and held a mirror in front of him as we cut his hair, unbelievable!  no crying at all! no fussing moving or anything.  I wish I had discovered this product and had the idea of the mirror 5 years ago.</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazing!  My son has autism and would not sit still at the salon for a haircut.  I tried everything from Great Clips and Supercuts to child friendly salons.  Nothing worked.  Getting his hair cut became a really traumatic event for him.  I ended up having to restrain him completely in order to get his hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these hoping that he would do better getting a haircut at home.  I read the reviews of other moms and dads with autistic kids and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was amazed!  He sat through the entire haircut and even let me trim his sideburns and the nape of his neck without the guard.  I have cut his hair like this for over a year now.  He still sits through it very well.  I LOVE these clippers.  I will never use anything else on his head.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve only used it once after getting it. Very easy to use, it worked well. Also we don&#x27;t care much about being very trendy and stylish, so this meets our expectation.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old with Autism recently decided he hates haircuts. I ordered these clippers praying he would let us at least trim up the sides. They were so much better than I expected. They aren&#x27;t super quiet but they don&#x27;t pull on the hair, are small, cordless, and have a lot of length settings.</li>
    <li> I thought it is specialized clipper/trimmer for babies or for infants but actually it is regular clipper with rubber stuff, but having extra things like seizer and peace of cloth is nice.</li>
    <li> Not very impress with this product. I thought it would be perfect for my toddler who dislike haircuts due to very loud clippers. I purchased the Philips Norelco CC5060 Kids Clippers because it&#x27;s supposedly very quiet. Unfortunately that&#x27;s not the case. Its noise level is still too loud for my toddler, he still won&#x27;t let me give him a haircut..... Oh well, moving forward!</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper for my 20 month old son who suffers a lot when we go to a salon for a haircut. He have sensory issues and like other parents said on the reviews is a godsend, I was able to cut her hair while singing and it was easy! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> as long as you use it fully charged and use the provided plastic attachments. you will have good result.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with cissor + hair coat + comb + 2 attachments + clipper itself.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend hair cut. After charging it could be used for a really long time. And no noise at all. Then I tried to use it for our puppy. (sorry for using the same one, but i got his permission) Puppy was not afraid of it and it is really safe to contact him because it will not hurt any more. I tried to touch it by myself. Really safe, light, easy to handle.</li>
    <li> What makes this product \\&quot;Designed for moms\\&quot;? What does it mean, \\&quot;Made for women&#x27;s hands\\&quot;? Philips, it&#x27;s time for you to get into the 21st century, or at least move away from the 1950s. Some of us dads actually do the parenting thing.  On a side-note, the definition of irony is putting a review of a dad-hating company on Amazon, which is just as guilty with its \\&quot;Amazon Mom.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Good suit it is. I feel it is so suitable for my baby. And my wife likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Extremely quiet clippers!</li>
    <li> Great experience. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My wife convinced me to buy these to cut our kids&#x27; hair. I&#x27;ve got a 3 and 1 year old, and the 1 year old still is not happy about cutting his hair with any clippers. These were a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to get the included guard to the right setting is useless because the plastic guard bends - it doesn&#x27;t matter what you set the guard to because it will never be consistent. The clippers are battery powered, and totally underpowered for the job. After messing with it for a while, I wanted to trim around my son&#x27;s ears to get some strays, and when I pulled off the guard and turned the clippers around to get the hairs by his ears, I nicked him and he cried. I thought it might be because he was scared or it might have hurt him a little, but I was totally surprised when blood started coming from his ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, these are not being used anymore. I do not recommend this clipper at all. The benefits of small size and cordless do not outweigh your inability to give a good haircut. Go get a better set than these and you&#x27;ll be happier.</li>
    <li> This is a great works.I love it very much.it&#x27;s really do me i favar.i will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Kids on the Autism spectrum. WAY quiter than traditional clippers. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love this product, easy to use and easy to maintain...</li>
    <li> The clipper is so easy to use.  It is better than expected.  It would be nice if the design of the cape can be improved to catch the hair.</li>
    <li> I like it. When I cut my baby&#x27;s hair at his 8 months, he cried loudly. He was scared by the noise of clipper. So I chooses this. baby didn&#x27;t cry this time. It is very very quiet!</li>
    <li> I use this clipper to shave my baby head, and it turns out that it is a safe clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to trim my husband&#x27;s hair and find it works better than an adult clipper&lt;br /&gt;And I am alson considering buy another one for my fahter.</li>
    <li> this is easy to use and great for all kids, i just wished it was more quiet so my son won&#x27;t cry as much.</li>
    <li> FAST EASY AND FUN, MY HUSBAND AND I HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE CUTTING OUR SONS HAIR FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND IT CAME OUT BETTER LOOKING THAN THE BARBER SHOP! SUPER HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> my little one used to refuse having his hair cut. however, Philips Norelco CC5060 Kids Clipper was magically accepted by my son. it&#x27;s handy, it makes very little noise and great cutting curly hair. i&#x27;m glad i found this product. no more screeming and yenking.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a baby gift for my friend&#x27;s kid. He loves it after 4-month use.&lt;br /&gt;Hair cut is so easy now! Five star</li>
    <li> These are not high-end clippers.  I do like that they&#x27;re small.  The length adjustment is great (no hunting for the right size amungst several guard attachments).  Nice rounded tip on the guard -no gouging on squirmy kids.</li>
    <li> These trimmers are light weight and very very easy to handle.  Very easy to work with too.  Works ok on hair.  Works good at first but after cutting with it on hair awhile it does not work very good.</li>
    <li> Glad I made this purchase. It did a great job when cutting my sons hair. Money well spent and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> My long-haired Persian kitty absolutely HATES an expensive corded shaver I own.  As soon as he hears it, he goes completely nuts!  But, after reading all the great reviews on this shaver, I just had to give it a try.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it multiple times, I would give this clipper 10 stars if I could!  I use it to trim down the overall length of his fur so he won&#x27;t mat up.  Combing him is so much easier and quicker now.  He even lets me trim his private parts area down to a really short length.  The clipper is so incredibly quiet that my kitty doesn&#x27;t object at all!  I use the plain clipper without any of the plastic combs - just grab little clumps of fur and trim away.  He ends up looking a little &amp;#34;poodle-ish&amp;#34; but he is really cute this way.  And we&#x27;re both a lot happier!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my 3years old son. He doesn&#x27;t like to go to hair salon so I bought it and trim his hair often.Best choice for the baby.</li>
    <li> Right when we got this we had to try it out.  I&#x27;ve attempted to give my son two haircuts with a scissors (at 16 and 17 months old) and was always nervous about getting around the ears and the neck, because he didn&#x27;t like how it felt.  Also, it took me at least 20+ minutes to do it, and there is no way you can get a kid to sit still for that long.  I was drawn to this product&#x27;s quiet setting and positive reviews.  When we tried it I really liked how easy it was to set the clipper length- no numbering systems to try and figure out.  If you want the hair to be 1/2 inch long, you set it to the 1/2 inch setting.  Got my son&#x27;s hair cut in about 5 minutes, and he didn&#x27;t mind it one bit.  In fact, he got a better haircut at home with this clipper than at the kid&#x27;s haircut salon, since they use scissors too.  Best of all, no tears!</li>
    <li> Very bad hair clippers. Doesn&#x27;t cut uniformly, it&#x27;s really a mess, especially when you have a little one who is afraid of the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes forever, literally, as you have to go 100 times along the same path -- the blue attachments are useless and they get stuck every two seconds with hair, no good at all as you have to move fast. The slowest clippers I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I am past the 30 day return period and cannot get my money back. What a waste!</li>
    <li> I really have grown to like these little clippers.  my 3 year old developed an averson to having his hair cut and I saw that it  could be recified but needed to go slow and work some discomfort and fear.  Although his hairdresser was kind and wanted to help, I knew that I could get him over this hair cut thing at home.  I bought these, asked MY hairsitylist to give me the basics of cutting boys hair.  since I have some experience clipping dogs I figured with some good pointers I could figure it out.  The clippers area quite, they are nice to look at with the blue and white, and smaller.  We worked on hearing the clippers and that I could touch the blades to the back of his hand and we both say &amp;#34;no problem&amp;#34; together.  The blades just vibrate on his skin and he learned to think it was funny.  Nearly 9 months later I&#x27;ve cut his hair with these at least 4-5 times and I&#x27;m pretty darned good at at now.  It looks professional and clean.  It did take some time and there were a couple of cuts that I  looked forward to it growing out a bit to cover a couple mistakes, but no big deal.  Whats better is now he about to turn 4 and having his hair cut is a complete non-issue.  I never use the large guard.  I use the clippers guard free to clean up around his ears and at the back, then attach the small guard on a low setting for the lower portion of his hair, then increase to a higher setting for the top of his hair.  I finish off working through the top of his hair with thinning sheers and call it good.</li>
    <li> fantastic. quiet. love the battery option. dont pull the boys hair. comes with a cape.  works great! better than our old mens hair clippers</li>
    <li> It is less noisy compared to normal clipper but still disturbing for my son. At the end, we could not manage to clip his hairs. Anyway, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Read the review for this item and went ahead and purchase it. When we went to use it on our autistic son he still panic which I figured it would still happen. We used regular clippers on him that you plug into the wall and decide maybe going cordless would be great. Especially if clippers are for kids. Clippers worked poor to my son&#x27;s hair length of half an inch. So as he was crying and clippers weren&#x27;t able to cut quick enough his hair probably because of the length we went a head and pulled out the regular clippers. I would do anything and by anything that would assist my son and his autistic behavior. Disappointed that I tried to return this $40 item and was sent an email once use you can&#x27;t, REALLY!!! Don&#x27;t by this item on Amazon recommend a local retail store with great return policy.</li>
    <li> I bought this in January 2013 and it&#x27;s lasted about a year.  After a few uses a small part on the cutting unit broke off, so every now and then the part would fall out.  Now the blue comb has broken completely.  I contacted Norelco thinking this would be covered under the two year guarantee.  According to customer service it isn&#x27;t and they directed me to a replacement parts site.  It would cost $25 plus s/h to order both replacement parts.  That&#x27;s almost the same price as buying a whole new set.  The question is do I buy another set?  I like how quiet it was and I like the cordless element.  But I think I&#x27;ll shop around to see if there&#x27;s something more durable.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why it is so noisy and it does cut well.  The noise is something that Philips can improve as that factor could be detrimental to kids and they are afraid of it.  Otherwise, i just hope my kid get used to it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these to anyone with a sensory sensitive child! Used on my son and he cooperated so much better! Not perfect but with time, I think we will be able to trim his hair without the huge screaming fit!</li>
    <li> I am not entirely sure how to review an electric hair trimmer for kids.  It worked fine for my 2 year-old&#x27;s first haircut--he was entirely unfazed by the process.  The razor is less \\&quot;threatening-looking\\&quot; than my Remington trimmer that I use occasionally on my own hair.  The adjustable combs are soft, rubbery, plastic which may feel better along the scalp.  As far as the noise, it is also significantly quieter  (but, certainly not soundless) than my Remington--which may have helped the process (though I didn&#x27;t try the Remington on my toddler for a perfect, \\&quot;controlled experiment\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very easy to hold in any sized hands--good for mom&#x27;s with smaller hands perhaps (but, also, probably easy for kids as well!  So keep out of reach or your toddler may shave his own hair or even your 1 year-old&#x27;s hair.)</li>
    <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t tried this on my kid but gave myself a decent hair cut using the attachments.</li>
    <li> This clipper lives up to its promise to be quiet.  It is a good choice for people sensitive to loud sounds, whether they will be the clippers or the clipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems a little fragile, though.  Soon after I got it, I dropped mine a short distance onto carpet, and a piece that holds together two parts of the guard broke off.  I had to weld it back on with a lighter for the guard to be usable.  I&#x27;m still quite happy with the product, however.</li>
    <li> I LUV THIS PRODUCT!!!! MY YOUNGER SISTER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND TELL ME IT IS FOOL PROOF.  SHE IS RIGHT.  IT IS.  I LIKE TO GET THE SIDES AND BACK CUT LOW KIND OF LIKE RIHANNA STYLE AND I HAVE THE TOP AND FRONT LONG SO I CAN CURL IT IN SPIRAL CURLS, WEAR IT WAVY OR NATURALLY CURLY AND NOW I DO NOT HAVE TO GO THE THE SALON AND PAY $25 OR MORE...EVERY 2 WEEKS.  THANX NORELCO!!!</li>
    <li> After reading more than enough good reviews, I was extremely excited to order these clippers to cut my little guys hair. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The clippers do not get close enough to achieve the shortness that I want for him. While cutting his hair was not a traumatic experience this time...which says a lot...the short style was not achieved &amp; he still needed his hair cut. Unfortunately, we ended up back in the barber shop:-(.</li>
    <li> Works really well used 5 times already and saved 1/2 of what I&#x27;d paid to have cut my son&#x27;s hair at the salon.  My only suggestion is get really comfortable with the cutters before using without the guide.  Made some off cuts and had to cut shorter..:)</li>
    <li> my husband is a dog groomer, so he is REALLY a critic on clippers as well as pretty expert.&lt;br /&gt;I cut hair and had rarely used clippers&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE NICE&lt;br /&gt;1.

    <li> This is a consumer level clipper that has the same features and add-ons found in most clippers available and marketed for home hair cuts. It is somewhat quieter and lighter, but at the same time lacks that tough barbershop feel that most people will be used to using. It cuts just as well as any clipper I have used in the past and has since replaced our old clipper.     The DVD though... THAT was helpful. When you think about it, most people including myself have no clue how to cut hair. Tossing the disc in made it pretty easy to bang out a good haircut. A definite plus.     The kids clipper aspect doesn&#x27;t really seem to hold much weight for us. It was never the clipper our kids feared, it was sitting still and getting their hair cut. Since the box lacked restraints, it&#x27;s safe to say the DVD is what makes this product stand out.</li>
    <li> I gave my son a haircut today and it was stress free. He has autism and the barber shop clippers upset him. These low noise clippers didn&#x27;t bother him. My only issue was that the guides didn&#x27;t cut his hair low enough. However, I was able to get the cut perfected without guide. This works great on Kinky/Curly hair.    I&#x27;m really pleased!</li>
    <li> I have never cut hair before but felt sure I could do a decent job.  I&#x27;ve thought many times in the past about buying a regular clipper to cut my son&#x27;s hair but never felt right about it and then I saw this lighter, simpler one.  I scooped it up on a lightning deal one day.  Only 2 cuts and it will pay for itself.  The dvd was helpful and not too long or boring to sit through.  My husband says our son&#x27;s hair looks better than the real barber!  I agree.</li>
    <li> wish I could rate zero stars . I work in the beauty industry ... I bought this for my son to cut his hair... this is a joke! didn&#x27;t cut his hair at all...  AT ALLL... trying to do a fade or mohawk, FORGET ABOUT IT! seller didn&#x27;t want to work with me for refund or any compensation, maybe good if your hair is over 3in long...&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUT THIS JOKE PRODUCT IF SERIOUS ABOUT CUTTING HAIR FOR CHILDREN</li>
    <li> Works great. My baby is 11 months and we used it twice already. Hope there will be many uses in the future.</li>
    <li> Very good clipper. Relatively quiet. Cordless is a big plus.</li>
    <li> Claims to be quiet but is not any quieter than the clipper I was replacing.  I set the comb to cut at 3/4&amp;#34; and somehow slid to 1/8&amp;#34; so my son got a much shorter cut than I expected.  He hates my old clipper and hates this one just as much. The comb is pretty flimsy and it takes much longer to cut. You can not get a crisp hair cut. Disappointing at best. Norelco dropped the bomb on this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Really easy to cut</li>
    <li> My son is autistic and doesn&#x27;t like the sound of clippers. This product is good for that. The guard was not so great, it broke easily on second use, but I just cut him low without the guard and his hair grows so fast it works for us.</li>
    <li> Clip attachments are not rigid - the plastic is sturdy but flexible at the same time, perfect for sensitive little heads.  It comes with two attachments, one for over 1&amp;#34; (up to 1.5&amp;#34;)  and one for under 1&amp;#34; (down to 1/8&amp;#34;) slide up or down to desired length. It is as quiet as a bikini trimmer (best comparison I can think of), therefore, not ULTRA quiet, as claimed, but quiet enough to not terrify the munchkins.  It is NOT water submersible, but somewhat waterproof, and cordless.  I couldn&#x27;t think of why you&#x27;d want to cut your kid&#x27;s hair under water, but hey... Anyway, GREAT value for the price.  Very happy with this investment!</li>
    <li> Our son needed a haircut so I ordered these.  The shipping took longer than expected so we ran over to Walmart and purchased a standard hair clipper package.  It worked great but we noticed that the buzzing around his ears started to bother him towards the end.  We were hoping that when the Philips Norelco showed up that it would be much quieter (as per the details) and that it would alleviate the problems around the ears.  It turns out that it is just as loud as the ones we purchased from Walmart.  Overall this product seems like it is of decent quality and design.  I&#x27;m sure the DVD may also be helpful.  They are simply not as quiet as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for a specific task.  It is the best hair trimmer for use by moms on their little kids.  I have an autistic son which is extremely stressed out by the sound of my Wahl, Remington, Braun or Sharp hair trimmers. All my hair trimmers are the top of the line, ultra hi-tech for their specific models.  But this Philips is the only one he actually does not mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Packaging - I love the pretty packaging which shows pictures of little boys having a haircut with this. I presented the box to my son.  He read the box, front and back, and he agreed to have his hair cut.  I guess the fact that he could see other kids using it, he is not intimidated by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Ease of use - It comes with an intructional DVD and literature as well.  A complete beginner will have no problems using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Ergonomics - It is smaller than most hair trimmers so it fits smaller hands very well, and is easier getting around the ears and neck.  The attachments cover from short to long cuts.  It has 2 attachments, one for close cuts and the other one is has adjustable cut feature. It also comes with a carrying case, comb, scissors and cape.  All the things you will need to do the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Looks - It does look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Quality - It is finely made and of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Power - It does not seem to have the same powerful motor as the large hair trimmers I have. But I guess that is the compromise for getting a small form factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;If you have kids and you want to be the one to cut their hair, look no further.</li>
    <li> The clipper quality is very good. The clipper&#x27;s engine causes very little viberation and the noise. Baby was very satisifying for the clipper.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has been cutting her young son&#x27;s hair.  She absolutely loves it and so does my Grandson.  She said it is very quite and he is not afraid of it whatsoever.</li>
    <li> My 2 yr old is not so afraid of the noise from this clipper.  It&#x27;s light, slim and real easy to use.  Great little clipper.</li>
    <li> My baby does not like it, every barber in tears. He is afraid with the Barber. The sound is not small, and getting bigger.</li>
    <li> Actually this thing worked extremely well.  I got it to shave my Himalayan and she was fine with it, I think she actually got to the point where she enjoyed it.  We also used the clippers on ourselves.  They were very quiet for clippers, and gentle.  I wish they had lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Very quiet.  These have paid for themselves between my haircuts and my son&#x27;s.  The small size makes it easy to use for giving yourself a haircut.</li>
    <li> It is a lot quieter than other clippers and it feels gentle on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.  I didn&#x27;t read the instruction/CD and just turned it on and worked on my son.  So the shorter comb with default position actually cut really short, close to shaving my 2-year-old son&#x27;s head. But the damage was done so I had to keep going.  Now my son looks like a little Buddha monk.  I will be more careful next time.  I like that it came with a pouch for storage.  Although this clipper is nice and quiet, it still took the Angry Bird game on my cell phone, a laptop simultaneously playing kids shows, and her aunt constantly talking to distract my son from grabbing the clipper.</li>
    <li> it easy to use and have little noice&lt;br /&gt;my husband use it to make haircut for our 4 months baby</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut any of my kids hair, too delicate</li>
    <li> Good for my newborn just 3 weeks old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly he has much hairs since he was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is quiet and good quality built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot find anything better within the price range.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my infant son had wild hair and I figured they&#x27;d think I was crazy taking a six month to get his haircut.  It works awesome, I just put him on my lap and zip zip he has a little buzzcut.  Has a soft hum that doesn&#x27;t scare him and gentle flexible guides.  Love it.  He&#x27;s now 8 months and I just gave him his second buzzcut and it&#x27;s still wonderful.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product works so well on a child with sensory issues.  My son was relaxed and calm.  He is able to receive a haircut minus the crocodile tears.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old never liked getting his hair cut with the traditional corded clippers... they were loud and vibrated alot. These clippers are much quieter but still powerful enough to cut his hair with ease.  I recommend these to anyone with a young child who is having difficulty in getting them to sit still so you can cut their hair.  The guards make it difficult to screw it up!</li>
    <li> Have never cut hair before and never planned to either, but my toddler absolutely hates the barber shop.  Like screams, cries, kicks and wails the whole time.  I finally decided to stop torturing him and try cutting it at home. This kit worked great.  I watched the dvd, set everything up, and went to work.  No tears!  Love that it comes with a cape, comb, and pouch.</li>
    <li> Works good to cut hair.  This worked very well when my son was afraid of going to the hair stylist.</li>
    <li> Daughter uses it on grandsons and loves it.</li>
    <li> My son is four and highly sensitive to sounds. We have never been able to give him the styles he wants because he is so afraid of the clippers. With the Philips the motor is soft enough that when we let him compare it to his father&#x27;s regular clipper he has no problems. Really its been wonderful! So glad we found this product. My husband actually cuts my son&#x27;s hair. He didn&#x27;t find the dvd all that helpful. Certainly don&#x27;t exspect to learn to cut hair with it. The clipper itself however, is excellent all around. It does everything its suppose to and the quiet motor is best of all. Highly reccomend it!</li>
    <li> The clippers worked well, but were not significantly quieter like I was led to believe. My son still screamed. BUT the blades work well, and seems of sound construction.</li>
    <li> so i bought this especially for my baby boy, shaved him when he was around 4 months. it was light and quiet, but the shave wasn&#x27;t very clean. you will need to run through the same spot at least twice (need to move the buzzer slightly to the left/right to get it done), it&#x27;s the attachment that&#x27;s causing the problem of uneven shaves, but you wouldn&#x27;t wanna shave a 4 month old without it. overall it&#x27;s a good product. oh, did i mention that i shaved his hair while he was sleeping??</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay a barber to cut my 2 yr old&#x27;s hair anymore! I purchased the Norelco kids clipper to give it a try.  They aren&#x27;t as quiet as the kids barber shops but worked great!  We put in a movie for him to watch and cut away.  The package includes a blue kids cap which was also fun for him to wear.  Very easy to learn to use.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before but I just had to for these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2-year-old son throws tantrums every time he goes for a hair cut...I&#x27;ve even tried cutting his hair myself hoping he might be more comfortable with that. Nothing was working until I found these clippers online.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit nervous buying this because I didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d like the noise of a clipper BUT I received these clippers today and tried it out - HE LOVED IT!!! He actually enjoyed me cutting his hair and was laughing.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to all you parents out there with fussy kids when it comes to hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Truly a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the clipper isn&#x27;t all that quiet but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother my son. The guards are easy to attach. The charge lasts more needed (only took me 15 min to cut his entire head of hair). Although I didn&#x27;t really need the scissors, bib, and comb, it still is a nice bonus. WELL worth the $30+</li>
    <li> ...it left a lot of stray hairs here and there.  I had to scissor behind both my boys ears and it took about 10-15 minutes longer than our Flowbee and then there is the mess.  My husband and I are both experienced with clippers (especially me).  I went over my husbands first try and there are still tons of stray hairs.  I don&#x27;t know I guess I am biased after using the Flowbee because there is no clean up and the Flowbee is faster (but louder which is why we wanted to try this).&lt;br /&gt;My son has autism and is very sensitive to loud noises so this clipper worked great for him!  It is not as quiet as I thought it was going to be, sounds like a regular clipper maybe just slightly quieter.&lt;br /&gt;I am still getting used to the adjustable comb, it left a few short spots but it was probably operator error.  Overall Not a bad clipper at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m chinese buyer!I love usa!I hope go to usa travel !this item fit to my nephew!i like it!I like philips</li>
    <li> It was definitely a good buy!! Shaving my baby&#x27;s head at her 1 year was a smooth breeze becoz of this product. No sound, very easy to use and manoever, cuts hair very consistent. Is a lifelong product to keep, infact I gave a hair cut to my hubby with this too.</li>
    <li> This products is advertised as having a complete haircutting kit which includes a case, instructional DVD, scissors, comb, cape, etc.  Mine came with none of these.  I requested this to be replaced and the replacement also did not come with any accessories.  The clipper is actually quite good but both Amazon and seller have managed this product horribly.  Such a waste of time.</li>
    <li> it works very well, I have used for my 2 moths girl, she like it also. but i think it can not be used for the adult</li>
    <li> could be one of the best things I bought here. lovely color ,considerate design and lower noise which make itself well accepted by babys!  just the price gei a little too much volitility</li>
    <li> I use this for autistic son who 2 year old has lots for sensory issue. he crys so so much when i take him salon to get hair cut. last week we use it for first time. he cry little bit only when we go close to his ears because it says on the box no nosie but machine does make a nosie.</li>
    <li> there is no big noise while using it and it&#x27;s very quite, so my kid is able to stay and allow us to cut the hair</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who is 7 and autistic after researching for clippers that were quiet and not a lot of vibration.  He had started to get really upset during his haircuts with an adult corded clipper, crying and plugging his ears, which made it really difficult to get the sides and back so I decided to try a cordless hoping it would be quieter.  It is a bit quieter than the adult clipper but his hair is very thick and coarse so if it is too long, it actually takes longer than before to cut his hair.  I still use this one over the other though because it is so handy being cordless and also the adjustable guard doesn&#x27;t tend to fall off like the old one.  Overall, if your hair is not super thick, this is a good clipper.</li>
    <li> Less noise makes cutting around the ears easier on my kids.  And the rounded edges eliminate the chance for poking as they wiggle around during their hair cut.  Battery life is a little low.  I would recommend this product for younger children.</li>
    <li> I ever bought one, when my mom saw it, she asked me buy another one for my brother. It&#x27;s easy to use, especially for me, my sons ever complained when I cut his hair before, but he will never complain again! Good product and worth to recommend!</li>
    <li> There still loud but not that loud. My child is still scared of them but has started to let us cut his hair with them if we let him turn it on.</li>
    <li> if your kid is afraid of regular clippers these are much louder then regular clippers i have a set of $30 wahl clippers that are 10x quieter and my kid is less afraid of also if you look at the video on (U tube) the kid getting his hair cut notice they are playing music to cover the sound of the chattering of the unit</li>
    <li> nice and quiet, easy to change settings, shape fits perfectly in my hand...highly recommend for young kids. my 2 year old was scared of the noise from the one I use on my hubby but doesn&#x27;t even notice this one</li>
    <li> The video it comes with is very helpful. Very easy and not very loud compared to my husband&#x27;s trimmer. Helpful for my autistic son who hates the barber shop, he rather have mommy do it.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. The blue plastic is so flimsy. A piece of the guard popped off the first time I used it. Im still waiting for my refund from seller.</li>
    <li> This clipper worked for me in trying to cut my grandson&#x27;s hair. Only problem is that he&#x27;s got a thing about getting haircuts. The clipper has numerous add-ons that control the depth of cut. The charging unit seems to work well and holds a charge. The blade cuts hair but is easy on the fingers and scalp. The noise is much easier for a child to handle than the adult clippers on the market. I returned it, not because it didn&#x27;t work, but because it didn&#x27;t work for my grandson. If he ever changes his mind about haircuts, I&#x27;d buy this unit in a flash.</li>
    <li> It does its job but i think a standard clipper is better. Its kinda quiet. I dont think i would buy again.</li>
    <li> A little hard to use but it&#x27;s faster than a trip to the barber shop , doing it at home for my 2 year old he can watch his tv while we cut his hair.  The noise scares him so we had to do it quick, the instruction is not very clear and the video shows a kid with curly hair so which didn&#x27;t help either.  It&#x27;s not as easy as it seems.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Very quiet. Used it only once and so far no issues. Product build quality seems to be good.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this clipper for a little over 2.5 years. I started used it on my son when he was about 2. I used it 2-3 times on him at first, and although it worked fine, he hated getting hair in his face and he would start to cry. It also isn&#x27;t as quiet as I expected, and I think it bothered him a little bit. It&#x27;s about the same noise as hubby&#x27;s beard trimmer (same brand), but I don&#x27;t have other clippers, so I can&#x27;t compare. I assume most others are a little louder just from what I&#x27;ve seen in barber shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few times with this, my husband started taking my son to a barber, and my son does great. I think the compressed air blower is a big factor (to keep the hair off his face), but he has gotten used to their louder clippers also. My son is now 4 and I just recently tried these on him again after over a year of not using them for him. The noise was ok, but again with the hair in his face (he won&#x27;t hold a cloth up the whole time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair on a fairly regular basis. He will get occasional cuts at the barber when he takes my son, but we use these regularly for him because he keeps his shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longest setting goes to about 1 3/4 inches. However, I have tried to use the bigger comb (1&amp;#34;+) several times, and it just doesn&#x27;t work well. I don&#x27;t know if my son&#x27;s hair is too fine, but I have to keep going over sections to get it completely cut, and myself and my son aren&#x27;t patient enough for me to do that. So, I usually drop to the smaller comb pretty quickly, which goes up to an inch. His hair lays pretty flat, so it looks short at an inch on the top (hair height is about the width of a finger), and I usually go shorter on the sides. My husband&#x27;s hair sticks up more, so it looks longer, even on a slightly shorter setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t do 2 haircuts back-to-back because the battery drains after about 30-40 minutes (in the middle of the second, since I have to repeat sections). Evenif I plug it in towards the end, there&#x27;s not enough juice to keep up and it starts to grab. I had to re-charge and touch up later in the day, because it left stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use it on occasion for my son since I think it is a little quieter than most others are and it&#x27;s easy for me to maneuver. I think he will still go to the barber most of the time though. I&#x27;ll still use it for hubby and for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planning to get something else to use so I can do more than one cut a day, and get something with a longer comb attachment (over 1&amp;#34;) that actually works. I have a younger son with curly hair, but I probably won&#x27;t cut his hair at home anyway, so I&#x27;m close to being done with these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned five different consumer and one professional clipper over the last twelve years (three of the five consumer trimmers are still working well - including my CC5060... the professional trimmer is on its last legs).  The CC5060 trimmer is very good, and while not built with the same quality and durability as a professional trimmer, it costs between five to ten times less than a professional clipper (depending on the professional clipper you&#x27;re looking at).  Additionally, there isn&#x27;t a benefit to buying a professional clipper for home use as the cost alone makes it a losing proposition.  The professional clipper I owned was a hand-me-down and rarely gets used due to the fact it&#x27;s more complicated (than the CC5060), and (unlike the CC5060) most professional clippers require a lot of maintenance to ensure a quality haircut.  The CC5060 is very convenient and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the military and cut my own hair.  I purchased my first CC5060 about four years ago when I found it on clearance at Target for around $30.  I had been using a beard style clipper because they tend to do a good job when cutting your hair very short.  I actually found this clipper cut more cleanly and evenly almost down to the closest fade levels.  I still needed the beard clipper to do the fine details along the edges, but this clipper cut the time needed to do all the other areas at least in half - and it essentially cuts as cleanly as a well maintained professional clipper.  I have to cut my hair at least once every week and a half (with maintenance around the edges) and this clipper has held up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only weak area of the CC5060 is the sturdiness of the combs - and Norelco/Phillips wants $19 plus shipping to replace each one.  As such, I&#x27;m purchasing another CC5060 in order to have a working set of combs.  As it happens, this works out well for me because this purchase will ensure I always have one at full charge when the other one runs out.  With regard to charge duration - I can typically get up to three haircuts out of one charge (lithium batteries).  I can take up to 35 minutes (of clipper time) to get things just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With respect to cutting a child&#x27;s hair with the CC5060: this clipper is much quieter than most of the other clippers available on the market and doesn&#x27;t transmit vibrations as much either.  My 19-month old has no problem sitting through a haircut with this clipper.  He hates my other clippers though - another reason to expedite the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;The combs on this clipper are also designed for the finer nature of most children&#x27;s hair.  I can see how curly hair can cause some issues though (the negative feedback that I&#x27;ve read) - but those issues will happen with any clipper and require someone with experience to get it right.  This is because a clipper is really not suitable for anything but the sides of the head (which can be cut shorter) when dealing with a head of curly hair.  Curly hair typically is best handled with an experienced set of barber/stylist hands controlling a pair of quality shears.e duration - I can typically get up to three haircuts out of one charge (lithium batteries).

    <li> We bought this because we have 3 boys in the family and we all keep our hair relatively short, and so Mom can cut it to save us money and frustration.  After about 3 months the plastic piece broke.  So here we are looking for a new one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Cordless&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Broke</li>
    <li> My 5 year old son has down syndrome. Hair cutting was truly a huge ordeal. It would take us at 2 to 3 hours with breaks of course to cut his hair. I purchased these last month and just used them for the first time today. WOW what a huge difference in time. He actually sat still. No crying what so ever. When we were done he even gave us a high five. I purchased two sets and HIGHLY recommend these for all parents of kids with special needs who suffer from sensory issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my house cat&#x27;s &amp;#34;backside&amp;#34; No sharp edges on clipper blades, not too noisy, more than enough charge for multiple uses. All that I need!</li>
    <li> Quite pleased.  I&#x27;ve owned it for almost a year now and it&#x27;s great for cutting my son&#x27;s hair.  He just turned two and is cooperative, but still doesn&#x27;t sit still for long.  These won&#x27;t injure him, do a decent job cutting, and have a long charge so we can get the job done a few times before recharging.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome. I dont have to worry any more about my sons haircut. Easy to use and no noise. Recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> The dvd wasnt all that easy to understand but in terms of kid friendly it definitely is the sound is very quiet an my son who is extremely afraid of the barber was laughing saying it tickled.  My first two sets of haircuts came out blotchy and crooked so if u knw how to cut hair this is a great product and if not jst let their hair grow.haha</li>
    <li> Very good for children I recommend it for everybody who has a child</li>
    <li> It is see had used by other people,it is have hair inside machine,look like I am bought an second hand product?</li>
    <li> I love the size of the clipper. It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise. I use it for triming my cat. She isn&#x27;t afraid of it. I&#x27;m sure that using it on young kids makes it a lot easier. They shouldn&#x27;t be afraid of it!</li>
    <li> overall its a solid product just a little quieter than normal clippers and the adjustments worked well. I give a solid recommendation</li>
    <li> Easy to use, quiet with sharp design to cut young children&#x27;s hair. Do the jobs so well. Love it!! No looking further if you have a child with autism and want to have a good looking hair cut, this one, get it now. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work the 2nd time, after charging it over night. I cannot return it just because it&#x27;s 5 days past a 30-day return period!</li>
    <li> I love it! Very easy to use, and it has a DVD to tell you how to use it. just buy it!</li>
    <li> It is really amazing hair clipper which does not make noise much.&lt;br /&gt;I have searched so many hair clippers to get the best for my kid and if possible for adult together before I have bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;After I bought/received this product I felt I took correct decision(as always).&lt;br /&gt;Product has been delivered within stipulated time which is really appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;I am in Australia and this product was received from USA and the plug and power will work in Australia too....so no issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for those who is looking especially for kids and adults.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Mahesh</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Just slightly quieter than my &#x27;adult&#x27; piece. It does not clean the cheek and neck as a clipper should. I would not recommend this for a precise and long-lasting CLEAN  cut!</li>
    <li> it is difficult to cut around my kids ears with this i replaced my old one with this one that does not work</li>
    <li> Purchased this last year for my son with Autism.  Thought from the reviews it would be quieter.&lt;br /&gt;The attachment on the top holds hair so I am constantly blowing the hair out while cutting which is annoying. We have had times where the attachment slips and you end up cutting a section shorter than the rest.  The flexibility of the attachment makes for an uneven cut, depending on how hard you push down.&lt;br /&gt;The only feature I really like about this clipper is that it is cordless.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Wife cuts my hair every two weeks with this. Also use on the cat. Quiet.</li>
    <li> i like it . easy to use. easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;i need to study with more Hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;my neighbor call me Barber</li>
    <li> My son is 14 months old, and today we gave him his first hair cut. I was totally expecting a screaming match. I put my son in a tall chair with booster seat, wrapped him in the cape, gave him a pretzel rod, and turned on Sesame Street(his favorite show). I am not very experienced with cutting hair so I was a little nervous. I showed him the clippers before I got started and ran it though his hair without turning it on first to show him what I was going to do. Then it was time to cut the hair. It was surprisingly easy!! He didn&#x27;t seem to pay any attention to the clippers, but would get annoyed if I blocked the TV. After a few more times, I might get the hang of it and the cuts would take less time. I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Does the job well. Cant go wrong with this one for the price. It works as promised low sound. I reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I use it to shave my head in the shower. I put packaging tape over the button to make it more waterproof. I love it. Although, if they actually made it waterproof, it would be the best trimmer ever. It&#x27;s quiet compared to most, well sized, easy to use, and holds a charge for weeks. I use it once a week for about 6 weeks or more before I need to recharge it.</li>
    <li> Still noisy, but easy to use. My 2 year old son hates getting his hair cut so I thought I&#x27;d try to use these while he sleeps. It&#x27;s still a little loud and I&#x27;ve only used it once. Hopefully, when he&#x27;s older, he can tolerate it.</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars I would have. In no way is this clipper quiet, it does not cut evenly and the guide to change the length does not stay in place. If my husband had thrown out the package I would have tried to send it back, completely disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco CC5060 Kids Clipper  is very good！Baby did not cry when we cut her hair .I believe philips.</li>
    <li> this clipper i bought it is not quiet, but very noisy. So i want to return it. How should i do?</li>
    <li> I bought, cut hair to my son&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s easy...and design is simple&lt;br /&gt;but i needs work hair cut...&lt;br /&gt;so my son waiting growing up his hair in the house...^^</li>
    <li> Sound like any other Hair Clippers I have bought.&lt;br /&gt;My Austitic Nephew still runs away when I turn on the Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Starting to think that all those Austism Reviews were LIES!!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buzz my sons hair. We tried the kid salon but he hated it and cried the whole time. So after some searching on Amazon, I came across this one. My son actually let me buzz his head. At first I let him play with the clippers (before charging so he couldn&#x27;t turn it on). Once he was familiar with it and bored I got started. I let him play in the bathroom sink and then I proceeded to buzz his head. It made very little noise. It was gentle and I was able to get around his ears without him moving too much. He tried to brush it away like one would do to a fly. With the attached guard, he didn&#x27;t touch the blade and I wasn&#x27;t worried about cutting him. Good product and with a good baby, a good buzz cut will be obtained.</li>
    <li> This really amazing clipper help me to save my money and avoid all tears. We start to look for that kind of clipper after my 18 months son&#x27;s first hair cut at barber shop. It was terrible. Now completely another story, he even does not hear any scarred noise and just keeps playing. 4 stars only because battery life is too short.</li>
    <li> My son HATED getting his hair cut with adult size clippers.  These are much quieter.  The wireless option makes it much easier to place him in front of the TV with his favorite movie.  Hair cuts are a breeze now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: the guard is a little flimsy.  I already broke part of it, but it still works fine.</li>
    <li> The marketing angle in this product is whisper quiet operation...I found it being the same level of noise as my 15 year old Remington hair cutter (which is a low-end model). It&#x27;s far from being noisy but I was expecting whisper quiet operation from the marketing. However, this is still a really good clipper for kids and will stand the test of time -- if you don&#x27;t drop it on a hard floor of course.</li>
    <li> My son is 19 months old.  He has had 1 haircut at the salon at 1 year and he did ok...then we took him another time, which ended in a slight trim because he was freaking out.  The third time, he screamed bloody murder for 20 minutes before I gave up and we left without a hair cut.  I trimmed his hair in his sleep because he wouldn&#x27;t let me near him with even a tiny pair of grooming scissors with the blunt tips!  At my wit&#x27;s end (and my son looking very similar to Moe from the Three Stooges), I sought out kid&#x27;s hair clippers.  These Norelco Kids Clippers had great reviews, so I figured it was worth a shot.  I think the heaven&#x27;s opened and the sun beamed into my living room when my son slightly fussed at the clippers, then completely let me do his entire hair with very minimal whining.  I was very prepared to have to get him in a headlock and shear him like a sheep, however, the experience was...dare I say...pleasant!  Now, he looks better than my wildest dreams, has an amazing hair cut and was an absolute angel the next day when I just finished up trimming around his neck with them.  If you have a boy who is difficult when it comes to hair cuts, BUY THIS PRODUCT.  Outstanding, I am so happy I bought these!</li>
    <li> Sound is very small, easy to use. If the price is cheaper.Would recommend to a friend.But not easy to clean up.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s recommendation is very good, very good product, I very like to use it, it brings me a very good enjoyment</li>
    <li> while this is a quiet one for kids it is not very durable.  i have only used this a handful of times and already it stops cutting midswipe if it gets a little clogged up with hair.  but it&#x27;s a haircutter and i would expect it to be able to handle this...unfortunately i must have too high of an expectation for this.  i would spend a little bit more to get a better one next time.</li>
    <li> Really not worth the price.  Thought these were silent clippers but they are just as loud as any other clippers.  Do not cut good.</li>
    <li> Been using this to cut boys&#x27; hair with this for 3+ years and it&#x27;s still working like a boss.  The guide cracked and I had to superglue it but that&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s given me any trouble.</li>
    <li> Have used this CC5060 clipper about two years.  My wife uses it almost every month for my kid.  It&#x27;s still in a very good working condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1. Quite. This is a big deal to my kid.  The reason that my kid hates having hearcut (before we use this one) was the high noise level from other clippers.  While with CC5060 clipper, I am not saying that my kid loves having hearcut, but at least my kid has no problem with its noise level.&lt;br /&gt;2. Rechargeable battery lasts long.  It does not need to recharge the clipper every time.  I probably recharge it for every 4 times of usage.&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to clean.  You can open the guide comb to fully clean it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Small size - just fits my wife&#x27;s hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;I will update it when I find it.</li>
    <li> Bought these for our 22 month old son, who is terrified of &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; clippers.  To be completely honest, the motor is far from silent but it does do a good job of hair-cutting and it does have a nice clip system for adjusting the hair length.  Has a nice feel in the hand but is really no different from norelco cordless clippers in terms of noise levels.  It is definitely a quality clipper but I though it would be much quieter, as it is supposed to be for Kids.</li>
    <li> my wife used it,and told me it is very easy to hand.but she cut my hair first.i think my baby will enjoy it</li>
    <li> It works good and safely with Kids. However, I have to clean during clipping because hair is got stuck. I use for my son and myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not loud and works very well.  It comes with the scissors, smock, bag type thing and other attachment.  I will be buying another one bc this one was damaged in Hurricane Sandy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product since my son is autistic and I was having problems using a regular buzzer on his hair. He would cry and fight with me every time I did his hair. So, I thought I would give this one a try after reading the reviews. Lets just say, no crying and this was the first time I was able to clean his neck and ears up without a fight. So happy I bought this. What a great product!!!</li>
    <li> It is quiet tool but the plastic part was broken at my first time using it. I am not really like it because other similar clippers can be as quiet as it with a lower price.</li>
    <li> This is the worst clipper I have ever bought. It just doesn&#x27;t cut well and if the hair is more than 1 inch long, forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is just designed poorly. Case in point: the hair gets jammed up in the blue attachment and then you can&#x27;t cut any hair at all!! I wasted my money on this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this clipper is somewhat quiet, if you really want a quiet clipper, get the Conair model below, it produces 1/3 the noise of this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair HC408 powered clipper (not portable) -- this thing is QUIET and actually cuts hair!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item few weeks ago. It is easy to use, and best part is you do not need a cable. Only use it once. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. arrived very timely (thank you Amazon). Exactly as described even though I missed the description of it being being &amp;#34;chargeable&amp;#34; so you can take it off the charger and cut &amp;#34;cord-free&amp;#34;..I hate dealing with cords so that was nice. Only 2 attachments that are easy to slide on and off. Motor was a whole lot quieter than the Wahl we currently use for my husband. He has a Norelco shaver and I would say the noise level was the same. Great product. Highly recommend!! (especially for those kids who think you are coming at them with a chainsaw)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very quite, my 3-month old is not at least scared.  it&#x27;s safe too.  the package comes with a very helpful video instruction.  i think i will spend some time on learning the hairstyles.</li>
    <li> Is it quiet?  Yes, but not silent as one might expect.  A child can still tell it is on.  It is as quiet as my electric razor.  I found that it doesn&#x27;t cut as well as I expected, leaving many hairs uncut as I ran the clippers through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest thing I&#x27;m upset with is the plastic guards.  It comes with 2 large adjustable guards.  First of all, they are really big, making it hard to cut kids hair since their heads are small!  I found it getting in the way and couldn&#x27;t cut anything other than the top of my child&#x27;s head.  It was too big to maneuver around the sides, back, and ears.  Also very fragile since it broke on the first time I used it.  Dropped it about 1/2 foot since the child moved while cutting hair and the guard broke.  Also, the guards are so specific to this particular clipper that you can&#x27;t use any other standard ones out there, and they don&#x27;t sell replacement parts.  Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t cut well, guards too big for kids heads. it breaks easily, and there are very rare replacement parts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how quiet this is. I bought the clippers to groom my cat. This is a cat who hides in the closet when he hears the dustbuster, but he doesn&#x27;t mind this at all.</li>
    <li> Has been used to the baby, the sound is very light, blade work well，If more dangerous with scissors, cut her kids out crying, with it relieved</li>
    <li> I bought it for my two sons but it is good to my husband, too.&lt;br /&gt;Even my 9 month old boy is stay still because it is so quiet and smooth to cut.&lt;br /&gt;I really love love love it.&lt;br /&gt;We aleady save hundreds dollars ^ ^</li>
    <li> We purchased this on amazon.com reviews, and as our autistic son is still not 100% thrilled with getting his hair cut, it is night and day how much better this works.  Super easy to use, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> We went with this kid specific model hoping it was quiet and didn&#x27;t scrape our kids head from sharp attachments.  It worked to our expectations and he even found it fun to hold.  It has a little noise but not too much.  Our kid found it fun to hold as he did much better getting his hair cut vs. our adult hair trimmer.  He is 1.5 years old.</li>
    <li> It is good for small children haircuts. But once the child is more than about 10 years old, the power or blade is not enough when it comes to more coarse or abundant hair. Like thick, curly pre-teen child hair. I have 4 kids, 3 of them boys and I used this product on all of them until last year. Now I only used it on my younger 6 yr. old boy. It is a very quiet and less intimidating hair clipper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it three times on my toddler.  He has sensory issues and head touching isn&#x27;t always welcomed.  Because of this I have used it under pressure as I don&#x27;t have much time.  In an ideal setting, with a child that calmly holds still I imagine this tool to be ideal.  The problem I had was inconsistency when using the longer hair settings.  And the guide not wanting to stay on the longer hair settings.  I imagine with time and practice, I&#x27;ll learn to love it.  Now my son has a short cut and looks clean, but militant.  The instructions are clear and well written.  I&#x27;ve been able to use it all three times on the same charge.  I was told at a beauty supply store that there are no clippers that could hold a charge for one hair clipping much less three!  I like the small size, and all the goodies that come with it.  Nice handy bag, decent cape, scissors do cut.  Now I need practice....  Priced right.  Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> Instead of taking my sons to get their hair cuts, and screaming their heads off.  This makes my life so much better!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used to cut my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair with scissors. No need to say it was a huge pain, so i tried  Philips Norelco CC5060 Kids Clipper. Amazing! it is quite ( my lil one is fine even when i shave close to ears), light, easy to maneuver. The cape is very soft. CD has clear instructions. You can do short haircuts,longish haircuts, you can fix your mistakes any time with ease. You can do much better haircut with this clipper than what they do in kids salons!</li>
    <li> Very quiet, easy to clean, my husband and I both love it, it&#x27;s light and small, just a little bit expansive .</li>
    <li> I bought it to cut my 8 month old son&#x27;s hair,it&#x27;s easy to work,and the styling comb, scissors, cape and pouch includ it is also useful.</li>
    <li> I asked around other moms to see what they use to cut their kids&#x27; hair. Most complained that their device was noisy and because of this their kids didn&#x27;t enjoy the experience of getting their hair cut. This Norelco is quiet and makes cutting my kid&#x27;s hair so much better. It also comes with a cape, a carry case, hair-cutting scissors, and 2 attachments with multiple length adjustments. Absolutely LOVE this product. My only regret is not buying it sooner!</li>
    <li> Very quiet, very easy to use. Packaging is carton and plastic sealed packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are better than I thought. Very happy shopping.</li>
    <li> We bought this hoping it would help our autistic son get quick and easy haircuts at home.  First time using it, he flinched and got a giant bald spot because the guard didn&#x27;t work properly.  This was supposed to be quiet, but it&#x27;s actually louder than the old unit we replaced.  We ended up using our old Vidal Sassoon that was like $10 from Walmart to finish up and it did it a lot quicker.  This thing is so small and not powerful, that it takes FOREVER to cut hair.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and worked so quiet.&lt;br /&gt;My son didn&#x27;t cry or wasn&#x27;t scared at all because it was quiet.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also pretty easy to use and light.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this one for parents who wants to give their kids a haircut.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for cutting kids hair with.  They came with scissors, a cape, and a dvd that is hilarious.  My husband does the hair cutting, and he really thought these did a great job.  I think the kids hair looks wonderful and I love the way the comb height adjusts.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco help me to save some money. Now i don&#x60;t have to take my kids to the salon and pay bunch money every month.&lt;br /&gt;Philps norelco is very good for young children. I gladly recommend this product for parents that struggling on how to cut thier young ones hair. It is quite and affordable and it also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Got the raiser for myself as I wanted a small one that is easier to handle than the usual full size shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore not using the fancy attachments. Works as any other raiser would, it looks a bit odd without the blue attachment but put a q-tip into the guide, would be nice to have another piece of blue plastic to insert if you take of the attachments but guess that is not what this one is intended for, I have this problem with every shaver I buy as they usually do not consider this option. Bought a Wahl color clipper but that one has pretty thick blades and does not cut as closely and hurts a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper also advertised as our quietest model ever, is the loudest clipper I have owned so far!</li>
    <li> Like that you can use cordless and is quieter than wahl clippers. Haven&#x27;t used yet but plan to in the next month on my 9 month old son.</li>
</ol>
