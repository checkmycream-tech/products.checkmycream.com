<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Secret Outlast is a great product and really does give 48 hour protection through teaching gymnastics, dance, cleaning the house and even Zumba! The clear gel still takes a little time to dry before putting on a shirt but it&#x27;s totally worth it! Thanks to BzzAgent I got to try this product for free!</li>
    <li> Love how Secret Outlast drys in seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes</li>
    <li> I have hyperhidrosis and this product works pretty well. Sometimes by the end of the day I think it starts to wear off, but I&#x27;m a constant sweater. The clinical strength works about the same as this one for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff works awesome! I love the clear gel factor, no more white on clothes (even the ones that go on clear, the white stays white on clothes). I was skeptical about 48 hour really lasting that long...IT DOES! I have never had a deodorant work so well. I got this free to try, and have purchased it since then, its that good! It has a light pleasant scent and goes on smooth (not sticky). I&#x27;m so excited to share this with other woman, it REALLY works and does what it says! I&#x27;d highly recommend this for those on the go, that need long-term protection, and no more white streaks on shirts!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described.  It works.</li>
    <li> Keeps my wife fresh and dry!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of secret deodorant for years and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this new product.&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deoderant. It leaves no marks and dries very quickly and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant really works for 24 hours. It keeps me fresh through playing sports. I wore it when I went to the Bahamas, and it kept me dry and odor free in the muggy heat. I could still smell that clean scent at the end of the day. It wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, but nice and pleasant. not too girly.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network, but will definately be replacing my regular product with this one immediately.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample and thought it was like any other deodorant. I was never loyal to any one brand.  I was just trying to find something that smelled good and worked.  This is one of the best deodorants that I have tried in a long time.  It lasts and lasts and lasts.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t cake or leave marks on my shirts.</li>
    <li> This worked so well I received a sample from Secret to try for free and I have to say it dried quickly no white marks as promised I liked the light scent and it really lasted. It&#x27;s been unbearably humid this summer and this antiperspirant kept me dry and fresh all day. I&#x27;m really considering changing my deodorant thanks to secret</li>
    <li> i received this product from bzzagent. I greatly enjoyed using this product, after having my last stick deodorant break I needed a change. first the smell is fantastic, i tend to sweat a lot and i never noticed myself only the product and everyone else seemed to feel that way too. quick drying and stayed where it was meant to, not on my clothes. With summer here and lots of sweating ahead i&#x27;m finally happy to have found a product that really can work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff, quite frankly, just works. The scent is clean (my favourite of all the options in terms of subtlety), and I&#x27;ve never felt compelled to go all the way to the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength, just because this has done the trick. Note that I have never tested it&#x27;s 48-hour claim to fame. Buying the two-pack off Amazon saves the tax and shipping (if you have Prime). Sometimes there&#x27;s even a $1.00 coupon. Totally approve. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for odor.  If you want people pointing out to you that you are smelly, then use this!  ugh  however, it does work great for keeping you dry.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The only one I use.  The scent is wonderful and it works extremely well.</li>
    <li> Item completely as described. Great value. Good packaging. Works how it is supposed to, no complaints at all from my wife!</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as other Secret deodorant. Smells great applying but after about 3-4 hours after a shower it fails.  Does not last and does not work as well as my other Secret deodorant.  I tried this product for free from Secret as a promotional campaign.</li>
    <li> I used a clear gel deodorant before and didn&#x27;t like it because it left a wet feeling pretty much all day so I had my expectations pretty low for this but I was surprised by how much I liked it!  It felt dry after only a few seconds and it smells great without being overwhelming.  You don&#x27;t want the scent of your deodorant to overpower your perfume and this doesn&#x27;t.  I also decided to test out the claim of it lasting for 48 hours and it passed!!  Honestly, I&#x27;m not a very sweaty person to begin with but it&#x27;s been pretty hot recently and I put it on on  a Monday morning, did not reapply on Tuesday and I felt like it was still working.  Super impressed with this product.  *Full disclosure:  I received a sample of this product for free to test and give my full and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free through Bzzagent. I really like this product. It smells great, i dont break out from it like most deodorant and it really protects my clothes from white marks and yellowing from perspiration.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from BzzAgent thanks to Secret, in this same scent. I am the type that doesn&#x27;t like overly fruity scents in deodorant and this scent was perfect. Like clean laundry. And all throughout the summer I wear sundresses, this is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on the underarms. It&#x27;s a little slippery on your underarms til it dries, but waiting for a few minutes for it to dry is totally worth it. It&#x27;s the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Smallest sample ever!  And it seems to last a bit unless your really active and then I can sweat it off in no time.  I got this through bzzagent to try and give my opinion so here it is..  If your very active don&#x27;t waste your time, if your seditary couch potato then tour in the clear.  #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Ok ladies and gents, Secret has outdone itself. I got this free sample to try and I was amazed at how much I actually liked it.  The smell...omg the smell. It&#x27;s amazing!  It&#x27;s a gel that&#x27;s supposed to be stain free and dries instantly. I have never had any gel deodorant that dries instantly so I was very skeptical. I was also expecting the sticky feeling a lot of gel deodorants have. Surprisingly, it went on very smooth and was dry in about one minute. I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth my skin felt after it dried. There was no sticky feeling and it was completely dry. Not only that, but it lasted through the hectic day of a mother of two during a fishing trip!  I honestly gotta say that I&#x27;m switching over from Dove to Secret Outlast. Try it out, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sweaty guy do to work and exercise. This stuff lasts all day. This doesn&#x27;t smell girly at all. Its a similar scent as the dove original scent. Just a clean soap like smell. More importantly this and the dove 48 hour work best at keeping me dry. But Dove and others leave way to much residue in my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;So pr</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant. Let me tell you what are the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Nice scent. It was a little stronger than expected, but that was my fault for putting on too much.&lt;br /&gt;2) Lasts a pretty long time; I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;3) I have tested it, and if you put on enough..&lt;br /&gt;IT WILL LAST FOR 48 HOURS! That is pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) It isn&#x27;t clear as advertised. It still leaves white marks. (It&#x27;s more noticeable for me because I have dark skin.) However, this can be fixed by putting on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great deodorant! Just buy it at brick-and-mortar store. It&#x27;s about $7 here, but at a brick-and-mortar store it should be $2-4 depending on your location.</li>
    <li> What can I say...I work outside in the summer and this product keeps me from smelling like a cheesesteak! Well done!</li>
    <li> This one for me is best without having to go to the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength. I can typcially find this on sale here through amazon at different times, so helps in cost too.</li>
    <li> This has a stronger scent than what I expected. The smell isn&#x27;t bad but not the best. It still does work for the entire day.</li>
    <li> this is the best product for its purpose... I highly recommend it.  And i&#x27;m in Afghanistan... trust me, it works</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the best I&#x27;ve come across to help beat the Arizona heat!</li>
    <li> Thank you! Everything is super!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant as a free sample from secret and was excited to try. Not a fan of the scent. I received &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; and it smells like Plumeria from B&amp;B Works in the mall. It dries super fast as claimed but I don&#x27;t think it keeps me any drier or fresher than most any other I&#x27;ve used. I wouldn&#x27;t buy solely based on the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I use secret because it works far batter then anti-persperants/deodrants for men.  I usually like to switch the type of Secret product I&#x27;m using, i.e. gel, etc.  This one works great.  Tell your friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking this was the gel I&#x27;m accustomed to using instead a recieved two solid sticks.Doesnt work as well as combating under arm ordor like the gel does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve delved into natural solutions and designer deodorants (like LaVanila) and they have not worked for odor nor wetness. I am not a profuse sweater, but I do need odor control. This product lasts the full 48 hours, I tried it and it worked for me. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or white marks on clothes, and it feels clean all day. If you find that you&#x27;re still sweating or stinky after using this, you may need prescription strength because this is a hard working deodorant. I tried the completely clean scent and it smells like cucumber water if you were curious. Received a free sample as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I confided in a close female friend that my starched pressed dress shirts and I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;smell so fresh\\&quot; - to put it mildly - at the end of the day despite daily showers and deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She suggested shaving my underarms daily which was not so strange to me because I am an amateur athlete and have done triathlons and marathons that required shaved pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short:  shaving my underarms and using \\&quot;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent\\&quot; has worked for me perfectly and has eliminated all odor every single day since I tried it.  This has been well over a year. It is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four other things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my dark shirts; don&#x27;t know if this is because of the product, or because I&#x27;m more careful applying it, and&lt;br /&gt;2.  I like the scent \\&quot;completely clean\\&quot; because it isn&#x27;t too feminine - perhaps unisex?  - and&lt;br /&gt;3.  Note that the 5.2 oz is the weight of the \\&quot;twin pack\\&quot;, and&lt;br /&gt;4.  Secret \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; has 20% active ingredient.  This product has 19%.  I love to read the label!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that it is advertised to work for 48 hours - and I can not attest to that since I shower every morning before I leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum:  shaving plus Secret outlast \\&quot;completely clean invisible solid\\&quot; works perfectly for me - thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!

    <li> Maybe it was me and I should tried a different brand but I sweated a lot.  Too much to my liking.  Brought Secret&#x27;s  clinical and paired them together abd my problem was solved.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with my deodorant not lasting all day. I got this product as a sample with bzzagent.com! Wow I am so impressed. As a stay at home mother with two kids, I a constantly chasing kids  around with little downtime. I love that I can put this on and it will last throughout the day and more! No white marks or anything. I just subscribed with amazon to get this delivered every 4 months! So excited!!!&lt;br /&gt;-mamabee</li>
    <li> i have always been a Dove and Soft and Dri girl ,but i got a free sample of this and soooo glad i did bc i would have never tried it. i really luv the smell and keep me smelling great all day thanks Secret1!! Im a Secret Girl now!!:)</li>
    <li> I like this product  and it doesn&#x27;t leave your under  arms white  and it smell&#x27;s good too.  I will be buying mor of the in the future.</li>
    <li> Great Deodorant, Great Value!</li>
    <li> I did not love this. It smelled only &#x27;okay&#x27; to me. It seemed like it took forever to dry so I could to enjoy sticky feeling armpits for a while. It stood up to normal amounts of activity but not heavy sweating so I felt gross and stinky at the end of my busier work days. Not really something I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get on my clothing, and keeps me from sweating, this is the only brand of deodorant I have ever used and I&#x27;m NEVER switching.</li>
    <li> I receive this product from bzzangent for free for review purpose to give my honest opinion. This is the best deodorant I ever use I sweat all the time and using this I only sweated a little and it still smells fresh even after 12 hours or after a shower. 5 stars I would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> A subscribe and save product for me. Price is right, I never run out and don&#x27;t have to rush to the store.</li>
    <li> very pleasant scent, lasts all day, but it will leave white markings on your clothes. I am very happy with the quality, and a very gentle subtle scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan...this left me feeling sticky all day.</li>
    <li> I love this! Such a nice, fresh scent and it definitely does the job!  I will definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Good product, does what it promises!</li>
    <li> I works very well and for the price and convience I works really good for me. I do like the smell its not overly perfumy like some. But still has a clean fresh scent that last most if not all day.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Great coverage for all day amazing fragrance.. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> What can I say-it seems to work, the scent isn&#x27;t really strong, I don&#x27;t stink. Like all of these &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; deoderants/antiperspirants, this one can leave some marks as they all seem to no matter what they advertise. Easy enough fix-put it on once you&#x27;re dressed.</li>
    <li> I love the oh so soft scent of this antiperspirant.  I wanted to try something new that wouldn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing, and I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of Secret Outlast: Completely Clean and was disappointed. Upon application, if stung, probably because I had shaved that morning. The last thing I need is to have to worry about my deodorant stinging when I use it. Also, the smell is not a clean, soapy, just got out of the shower scent... It&#x27;s chemically smelling and overpowering. Even over my perfume, it&#x27;s all I could smell.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast. I received this as a free trial and thankful that I did receive it to try.  I am allergic to a lot of deodorant since I had my second child.  This deodorant does not break me out.  I can put it on without having it on my clothes.  I also do not have to reapply at lunch. I have used all my sample and now this is my have been buying it from the stores now. This now will be my go to deodorant.</li>
    <li> While it takes about an hour after applying to feel dry, the overall effectiveness is pretty great!  After applying, I&#x27;m not thrilled with the wet sticky feeling, but eventually it goes away and leaves me protected all day long.  It also has a pleasant and clean smell.</li>
    <li> I am a gel deodorant user but I am not a fan of the white marks on my shirts or the wet marks you get when you don&#x27;t wait for the deodorant to dry before getting dressed. I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent. I was impressed with Secret Outlast from the getgo - it dried quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about looking like I sweated through my shirt before I even left the house! This is a big deal to me as I do not have time to change shirts and start over in the morning - I have 3 boys to get out the door to school and one bathroom!! Time is a priceless commodity at my house in the mornings! Bonus for me was the smell - it reminded me of clean sheets. Very fresh but not overpowering or perfumey. I can&#x27;t say that it lasts 48 hours for me so far as I shower each morning but I sure am happy to know that in an emergency I can count on its 48 hour protection. I am considering switching from my regular brand for these reasons!</li>
    <li> A feminine deodorant that doesn&#x27;t smell like powder or flowers - just a nice clean scent that goes on clear, dries quickly and provides all-day odor protection (including the night hours.)  Really like this stuff.  I received a free trial from Secret to give my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> At first I definitely thought &amp;#34;deordorants are deodorants&amp;#34; BUT, not Secret Outlast. I was pleasantly surprised how the clear gel dried quickly... and worked for 48 hours! I am wearing black today and do not have have white marks. I love it. I will definitely be buying more once my free sample from Secret runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used secret but this was my first time to try oulast. I am extremly satisfied with it. It really stayed on all day long. It is my new FAVORITE! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have been using it for several months as part of a product promotion where I can try it free. I love the light scent &amp; it blocks odor for a long time without having to reapply. I highly recommend it! Plus no white deodorant smudges!</li>
    <li> Just switched from my old brand a week ago, and am amazed by the difference!  Secret Outlast goes on easier, though I do have to be careful not to get it on my cloths or it will leave white marks.  I love how long it lasts and how good it smells!  Will not go back to old kind, am a Secret girl now!</li>
    <li> #GotItFree and got to try it out!  Loved this product.  Not only is the smell awesome and long lasting, but my clothes stay their original color and do not get white under the underarms.  Great product. Long Lasting, Everything you could ask for in a deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant. I received it as part of a BuzzAgent campaign. It has a nice, clean scent and lasts all day even in the Florida heat. I usually stay away from gel deodorants because they leave behind a mess, but this product works exactly as claimed. Would definitely buy in the future.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about whether this would work for me or not.  I usually use a professional strength deodorant and was concerned that though they claimed it would work for 48 hours, that it wouldn&#x27;t cover me for even 12.  I received this free through the program called BZzagent, so why not try it!  The smell is a bit strong upon applying but fades quickly.  The coverage is great and has worked for me without needing to reapply.  I shower every morning and reapply so I have not tested it beyond 24 hours, but for that period of time it is a great product.  The bonus is that the clear goes on without staining my clothing.</li>
    <li> Received this as a promotion from the brand. Excellent protection. Love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about smell after using it. Clean scent.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast (in original scent) as part of a promotion. I have to say, all in all, it is a good deoderant. Although it isn&#x27;t quite a &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as Secret Platinum, it does provide all-day wetness protection. The frangrance is very pleasant and lasts throughout the day. When first applied, the deoderant can be a tad sticky, but that fades within a few hours. I&#x27;ve had no issues with any marks on clothing. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Got it for stocking stuffers, my daughters like that it doesn&#x27;t leave marks and the scent is gentle. Makes  a good gift.</li>
    <li> Why do they still make this type, went through it so fast. Opposed to the SMOOTH SOLID, lasts a long time compared!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant so much, I have been using the same basic Secret solid deodorant for as long as I can remember but for the first time in years I am so impressed that I am making the switch to the new Secret Outlast. Thanks to Bzz Agent and thanks to Secret for allowing me to try the product for free! It dries seconds after application and keeps you dry all day. I have always struggled with wet armpit stains and the past few days I have been able to wear whatever shirt I like without any worry. I highly recommend this product. Thanks again Secret for sending me the free sample!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this deodorant and it really last all day long. Great product! I would definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I was sent a sample to try and review this product. Now I never tested to see if it holds true to last for 48 hours, because seriously who goes that long without a shower and re-applying of deodorant? Not me anyhow. I love that the gel dries quickly, something I&#x27;ve never found in a gel before. After long sweaty workouts, I still smell fresh and clean. I love the clean scent of completely clean.  i would definitely recommend this product and purchase again for myself.</li>
    <li> This product works better than any gel I have ever tried. It hods up to a work out or an outing in 90 degree heat. I do not however enjoy the smell at all. So I will not be purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I love it! The product does what it says! I totally recommend this for women who on the go a lot during the hot summer days and more! Thank you BzzAgent &amp; Secret for the free sample! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> This product really works well and has a nice scent.. I love the Subscribe and Save option as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> In good condition, corresponds to what is offered and complies with expectations</li>
    <li> The positives:&lt;br /&gt;- I like the scent ok... not my favorite (I prefer unscented as long as it works), but for a scented product I like it.&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;- Works for a long time to control both odor and perspiration for me - at least 24 hours. It mentions 48 hours on the label which I haven&#x27;t tested yet, but I might try it in the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to be used up awfully fast, and I&#x27;m pretty frugal with the amount I use per application. I&#x27;ll be switching back to a solid for sure.&lt;br /&gt;- Maybe it&#x27;s just me as I don&#x27;t see other complaints about this but I have a horrible time using the &#x27;dispenser.&#x27; I generally put deodorant on shortly after getting out of the shower and if my hands are even slightly damp, I can&#x27;t twist the knob on the bottom to push up the product. Even when I dry my hands completely I can&#x27;t always get it, and if I accidentally get any of the product on my hand there&#x27;s no way I can twist it again to get my second underarm area without thoroughly scrubbing and drying my hands again. Wayyyy too much hassle just to put on deodorant. I don&#x27;t have the world&#x27;s strongest grip but it&#x27;s also not that weak. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone with any type of hand weakness or arthritis being able to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s okay, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. In case it matters to anyone reading the review I bought this in a local store, not on Amazon, but still wanted to review the product.</li>
    <li> I have ALWAYS use Secret but this stuff is way better than just the basic Secret you can get from BJ&#x27;s or Costco.  I feel really dumb for being in my 30&#x27;s and not trying it sooner.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite type of deodorant. It works all day without drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant, have tried all the scents, they are good but I like this the best. Good price through Amazon. Not always easy to find the ones you like in stores, nice to have Amazon carrying all of them.</li>
    <li> Received this as a promotion from a company that is one of the best that I have ever joined. Loved the scent made me smell wonderful. Is not expensive to purchase. Left my clothes clear no white residue. My underarms had no white clumps. Thanks for allowing me to try before I buy.</li>
    <li> Secret always works great and the Outlast has never failed me. I actually meant to get the gel and chose this by mistake but I&#x27;m loving it. It kind of smells like watermelon to me but you can&#x27;t smell like it you could perfume or something, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Item just as described.</li>
    <li> I have been a life long Secret user, but I stopped using Secret for awhile because I found it to not meet my needs. It caused my odor to smell worse than just not wearing any! I switched to men&#x27;s to get away from the aluminum, anti-antiperspirant aspect but didn&#x27;t like how I would always smell like my boy-friend. Thus, I went on a search for a better women&#x27;s deodorant again. Outlast came out on top, but I still am weary of the aluminum content. I now switch out between the Outlast and men&#x27;s deodorant every other stick and am very happy!</li>
