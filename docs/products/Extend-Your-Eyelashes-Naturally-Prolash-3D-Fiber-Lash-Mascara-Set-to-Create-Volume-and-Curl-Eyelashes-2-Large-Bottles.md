      <li>I am honestly surprised by the number of excellent reviews here.</li>
      <li>You can buy better at a drug store.</li>

      <li>the directions that came with this mascara are comical...</li>

      <li>My hairdresser noticed very quickly the difference in my lashes, so right then</li>
      <li>For this kind of money I expected better.</li>
      <li>the mascara is rather dry....does not extend my own lashes at all, barely even saturates or separates lashes...</li>
      <li>and I thought a mascara that offered healthy benefits to promote growth sounded great, plus all the promises of long, full lashes further enticed me.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy and really does extend your lashes.</li>
      <li>she said is better than any other that she had :)</li>
      <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
      <li>This Prolash/Mascara is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sparse lashes that I am in the process of strengthening and trying to grow</li>
      <li>and Prolash makes them look shorter than what the most basic drug store mascara.  </li>
      <li>This mascara felt &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; for lack of a better explanation, I&#x27;m not sure how to better describe it</li>
      <li>white , gets thickish after a bit too , but all mascara has issues , and this on e has some good points , on the label or site description .. and only the issues I mentioned were neg.</li>
      <li>The texture is completely different;  not sticky, easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Overall,  FAR SUPERIOR to any of the famous name and even more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>Product description says 2 x Large 6ml Bottles which indicates to me that two separate bottles of the product would be included.</li>
      <li>For the very high price this mascara is much inferior to my $6.50 drug store mascara that I have been wearing for 25 years.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it really added much volume to my lashes either</li>
      <li>Very east to remove.  </li>
      <li>and there was much lost in the translation.</li>
      <li>Doesnt add much volume or length.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It would have been better spent.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be any better then other mascara.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very similar to the double extend beauty tubes by L&#x27;Oreal, which in my opinion is a better product.  </li>
      <li>I normally would never spend $30+ on mascara but the rave reviews convinced me that I should.</li>
      <li>I live this mascara.</li>
      <li>No worries with this mascara, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have spent so much time and money looking for the right mascara</li>
      <li>I was to use as the first layer (it&#x27;s the white one).</li>
      <li>HUGE waste of money, would not recommend.</li>
      <li>Have used it for a couple of months and my eyelashes are ticker and longer naturally.</li>
      <li>There is no reason to spend $29 on this when it does absolutely nothing different than a drug store mascara.  </li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t make my lashes feel soft and lustrous.</li>
      <li>It is not clumpy and really lengthens my lashes and keeps them individual.</li>
      <li>It did help lengthen them but in a way that they looked obviously fake, after the first coat it looked like I had added many coats to the tips of my lashes,</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I don&#x27;t require instructions to apply mascara because those included appear to have been written by someone with a less than rudimentary understanding of the English language.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always envied the ones with long lashes and have tried several products promising to help with lash growth or even mascaras promising those long lush looking lashes with just one application.</li>
      <li>Only used a couple of times so far though so no word on if it makes my natural lashes grow as well.</li>
      <li>The only thing special about this product is the broken English on the instructions, which is actually quite funny.  </li>
      <li>Over the past several months, I&#x27;ve noticed slightly longer lashes and more lash growth.</li>

<li> Over the past several months, I&#x27;ve noticed slightly longer lashes and more lash growth.</li>
<li> The first side (black side) brushed on ok, the second side (white side) left awful large clumps at the tips of my lashes.</li>
<li> I have not been using it long enough to notice that they have grown, will update this review after I use it for awhile.</li>
<li> I use to have really long thick lashes before pregnancy, &amp; really wanted that same look back.</li>
<li> This product is different than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> I have very long and curly lashes</li>
<li> You can use the Collagen enhanced side (white side of the tube) by itself (which is not white mascara, it&#x27;s the same black or brown as the other side ) , or add length by using the black side of the tube.  </li>
<li> I see no difference between the contents of the black tube and that of the white tube of this product.</li>
<li> I have LONG lashes now!!!</li>
<li> Nothing dramatic, but it&#x27;s certainly an added benefit.  </li>
<li> The only problem I have with it is that the first few uses it is very thin</li>
<li> I am pretty disappointed I spent so much on a product that promised so much, with reviews to back it up, only to be so disappointed.</li>
<li> This mascara will give you nothing but a slight coloring on your lashes and an empty space in your wallet.</li>
<li> Not worth the money that I paid for it.  </li>
<li> It has two ends, one is a curling, and the other is a collagen formula that is to help your lashes grow!</li>
<li> From previous buying experiences, this may indicate that this product is from China.  </li>
<li> I like it 2 in 1 long thick black</li>
<li> A little clumpier than I had hoped but still looks longer and fuller.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The instructions on this product are written in a distorted version of the English language.  From previous buying experiences, this may indicate that this product is from China.  So beware!  I see no difference between the contents of the black tube and that of the white tube of this product.</li>
    <li> Like the product. Actually did make s noticeable difference</li>
    <li> I like it, but I&amp;#34;m not sure that it&#x27;s that much better than the Cover Girl I usually use.</li>
    <li> I went back to my Grande Lash Md mascara. I do not like mascaras thet make my lashes brittle. I also did not like the flexible wands.I found it difficult to remove without pulling out lashes. There are better mascaras for the money.</li>
    <li> I returned it.  The&#x27;collagen&#x27; side had no retainer and the product was unusablem</li>
    <li> I just did not see a great change. For this kind of money I expected better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. My hairdresser noticed very quickly the difference in my lashes, so right then and three, I ordered one for her, and dropped it off two days later. I saw her almost three weeks later, and her lashes looked amazing!!! She REALLY had a wonderful and FAST reaction to this. We both wear one layer of this under our favorite mascara. GOOD LUCK!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is different than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. First, it doesn&#x27;t flake. It doesn&#x27;t run;  no &amp;#34;Raccoon eyes &amp;#34; ever! The texture is completely different;  not sticky, easy to apply. Very east to remove.  You can use the Collagen enhanced side (white side of the tube) by itself (which is not white mascara, it&#x27;s the same black or brown as the other side ) , or add length by using the black side of the tube.  Over the past several months, I&#x27;ve noticed slightly longer lashes and more lash growth. Nothing dramatic, but it&#x27;s certainly an added benefit.  Overall,  FAR SUPERIOR to any of the famous name and even more expensive brands. I just bought a second tube.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be any better then other mascara.</li>
    <li> the mascara is rather dry....does not extend my own lashes at all, barely even saturates or separates lashes...was very disappointed in the product</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife she is loving it she said is better than any other that she had :)</li>
    <li> I like it 2 in 1 long thick black i will keep ordering from this coz also easy when i wash it .. It goes easly .. Thank you</li>
    <li> Made my eyelids swell and itch.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  You can buy better at a drug store.</li>
    <li> Far from great. Doesnt add much volume or length.</li>
    <li> My lash look amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product 10 stars!!! I&#x27;ve always envied the ones with long lashes and have tried several products promising to help with lash growth or even mascaras promising those long lush looking lashes with just one application. Every product has disappointed me until now. This mascara is amazing!! I have LONG lashes now!!! This mascara isn&#x27;t clumpy at all so if you are worried about this being a thick, clumpy, mascara that doesn&#x27;t lengthen your lashes, don&#x27;t be, order yours now!!</li>
    <li> I love this products - works great. What an improvement - make my eyelashes look like a million dollars.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> This dual set mascara is amazing!! I use to have really long thick lashes before pregnancy, &amp; really wanted that same look back. I tried this mascara because of all the great reviews, and it did the job!! Very happy with the results:) This would make a great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Goes on easy and really does extend your lashes. Easy to remove also.</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Definitely does the trick. A little clumpier than I had hoped but still looks longer and fuller. Only used a couple of times so far though so no word on if it makes my natural lashes grow as well. But all in all very pleased and will purchase again</li>
    <li> This is great mascara! It doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake and comes off easily. No worries with this mascara, I have very sensitive skin. Been getting compliments and all I changed was this mascara.</li>
    <li> I see no difference.  Clumps and comes off in sections. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I like this product , it can be slightly tricky applying , clumping .. but not too bad .the white , gets thickish after a bit too , but all mascara has issues , and this on e has some good points , on the label or site description .. and only the issues I mentioned were neg., so I give it a 4 star .</li>
    <li> the directions that came with this mascara are comical... Obviously from a non-Englidh speaking country and there was much lost in the translation. I had to go to the Internet to search out which end of the tube I was to use as the first layer (it&#x27;s the white one). I have found the mascara to clump at the lash ends. The mascara comes off in lengths, looks like a lash but it&#x27;s not... If you have used blinc mascara, it&#x27;s the same removal process.</li>
    <li> Terrible came dried out!</li>
    <li> This Prolash/Mascara is exactly what I have been looking for. I agree with everyone who gave this a 5 star review!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definetly purchase this product again</li>
    <li> Phenomenal! This by far is the best eyelash/mascara I&#x27;ve found. It is going to be my re-order item along with the Mineral Fusion mascara. I need to check to see if I can get it on my subscription order..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference from the cheaper brands at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Would not buy again. Does nothing different than regular mascara</li>
    <li> I am honestly surprised by the number of excellent reviews here. Maybe I got a bad batch but I did not have the same experience as everyone else with this mascara. I feel my Covergirl Lash Exact does a much better job of adding length and volume and it&#x27;s under $8. I normally would never spend $30+ on mascara but the rave reviews convinced me that I should. I have pretty sparse lashes that I am in the process of strengthening and trying to grow and I thought a mascara that offered healthy benefits to promote growth sounded great, plus all the promises of long, full lashes further enticed me. I followed the instructions, though they were somewhat confusing to understand, like they were translated from another language. This mascara felt &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; for lack of a better explanation, I&#x27;m not sure how to better describe it but it didn&#x27;t make my lashes feel soft and lustrous. It did help lengthen them but in a way that they looked obviously fake, after the first coat it looked like I had added many coats to the tips of my lashes, sure they looked longer but it just looked like a bunch of product stacked on top of itself, not like an extension of the lash itself. I don&#x27;t feel like it really added much volume to my lashes either, this mascara made them sort of clumpy at the base with stringy clumps extending off the tip of the lash. I wish I would have taken a picture to post here to illustrate what I&#x27;m trying to explain. I am pretty disappointed I spent so much on a product that promised so much, with reviews to back it up, only to be so disappointed. I feel like I wasted my money, I think I&#x27;ll stick with Covergirl.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS.</li>
    <li> Fortunately, I don&#x27;t require instructions to apply mascara because those included appear to have been written by someone with a less than rudimentary understanding of the English language. The product made my lashes very stiff and and &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34;,  and is not worth the price. Had I not thrown the box away upon receipt, I would have returned this item. For me definitely not a keeper.</li>
    <li> For the very high price this mascara is much inferior to my $6.50 drug store mascara that I have been wearing for 25 years. The directions were horribly written...or....badly translated from another language. The first side (black side) brushed on ok, the second side (white side) left awful large clumps at the tips of my lashes. I gave this mascara a 7 day chance with awful results. I had read such great things about this product that I jumped at the chance to buy 2 at the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; price. Thank goodness I was able to return the unopened one, now I&#x27;m stuck with the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. HUGE waste of money, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product and not so much just for the fact that it didn&#x27;t work but also made my short thinning lashes worse. This product cause them to break and fall out. My lashes are now noticeably shorter and thinner than prior to use.</li>
    <li> Seems globby. But for $30 I&#x27;m going to use it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the mascara. It seems clumpy and is difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> Sticky, gooey, totally ineffective.  I read the reviews. I should have paid attention. I use Latisse because my lashes are practically non-existent. I&#x27;m not looking to replace it, but it would be nice to find a mascara that enhances it and gives a bit more volume. This mascara will give you nothing but a slight coloring on your lashes and an empty space in your wallet. It&#x27;s been so cold that I should have burned that money for the minute of heat on my hands. It would have been better spent.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money that I paid for it.  The only thing special about this product is the broken English on the instructions, which is actually quite funny.  It&#x27;s very similar to the double extend beauty tubes by L&#x27;Oreal, which in my opinion is a better product.  There is no reason to spend $29 on this when it does absolutely nothing different than a drug store mascara.  I buy mascara once a month and have tried everything and this isn&#x27;t in the top 100 of what I&#x27;ve tried.  I have very long and curly lashes and Prolash makes them look shorter than what the most basic drug store mascara.  Save your money and go to a beauty counter or drug store.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> I live this mascara. Have given it to a couple of girl friends who also loved it. Have used it for a couple of months and my eyelashes are ticker and longer naturally. The only problem I have with it is that the first few uses it is very thin but as you use it it gets thicker and easier to apply. Easy to apply and easy to remove. The best mascara ever.</li>
    <li> The product does not say where it is made.  The instructions that come in the package are in pigeon English!  After reading them, I was so put off that I returned the product.  I don&#x27;t want something next to or in my eyes made with who knows what from who knows where . Very creepy!</li>
    <li> This mascara is by far the best that I&#x27;ve ever tried! I have spent so much time and money looking for the right mascara and I&#x27;ve finally found it. Im forever a customer!!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! Two in one! It is not clumpy and really lengthens my lashes and keeps them individual. I do not like waterproof mascara as it is so hard to remove, this comes off with soap and water and doesn&#x27;t leave raccoon eyes if you forget to wash it off before you go to bed. It has two ends, one is a curling, and the other is a collagen formula that is to help your lashes grow! I have not been using it long enough to notice that they have grown, will update this review after I use it for awhile.</li>
    <li> Product description says 2 x Large 6ml Bottles which indicates to me that two separate bottles of the product would be included. I only received one. :-(</li>
    <li> It is a fair product. Still doesn&#x27;t compare to Clinique brand.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. Lasts all day, no 3pm raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and easy to remove.</li>
</ol>
