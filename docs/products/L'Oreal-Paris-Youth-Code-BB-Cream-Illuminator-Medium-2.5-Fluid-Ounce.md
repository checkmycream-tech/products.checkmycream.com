      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>and I will say I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>So light but provides great coverage and sun protection.</li>
      <li>This has a nice tone to it, it covers well.</li>
      <li>I noticed that it did a really good job of making the differences in my skin a bit more even while still showing my freckles which I don&#x27;t like to cover up.</li>
      <li>This one is on the thicker side, so if you want more coverage, it is good for that.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make all your imperfections vanish, but for a one layer application it does a nice job of diminishing them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>(Nice that it is under 3 oz</li>
      <li>Nice color tone.</li>
      <li>It enhances your own skin tones without the &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34;</li>

      <li>I am thrilled with this product and plan to continue to use it.</li>
      <li>Living at my mile high location, this gives sun protection as well as a flawless coverage which lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>My niece normally text me but after trying this item she called me to tell me this is the best.  </li>
      <li>smooth application, great color match and very light formula.</li>
      <li>but Fair probably would have been more appropriate.  </li>
      <li>Best BB cream out here and better than the high end ones.</li>
      <li>But this is by far the best yet!</li>
      <li>This is much more effective than rubbing it in.</li>
      <li>Great for daytime or if you just want a nice finish without much coverage.</li>
      <li>love this product, just the right amount of color, great moisturizer, and stays all day</li>
      <li>true BB cream will give you \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, minimize skin imperfections, and if good, can even take the place of your foundation.  </li>
      <li>but I also thought it would have very light coverage (</li>
      <li>the light is a perfect match, and I&#x27;m not a pale person!  </li>
      <li>Love the price.  </li>
      <li>If you are a non-makeup person like me you will fall in love with this stuff.</li>

      <li>You might even try the Maybelline (which was ok but too shiny for my taste).  </li>
      <li>Surely, they did not have what I wanted in stock</li>
      <li>you are experimenting with BB Creams and not looking to fork out a wad of cash for a premium one, I&#x27;d suggest trying the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling it locally, I really love this stuff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product - great price.</li>
    <li> smooth application, great color match and very light formula. a great product for anyone who does not like heavy foundation but wants coverage and sun protection</li>
    <li> I like the coverage it gives but it feels a little greasy when there is high humidity. I would choose it again</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use it in combination with youth code dark spot corrector and youth code illuminating moisturizer. This bb cream does wonders for my skin. A little tip: apply a small amount to (clean) fingertips.. Rub them together some and apply it to your face by patting your face with your fingertips repetitively all over. This is much more effective than rubbing it in. It definitely gives you a glow if you apply it correctly!</li>
    <li> My must use daily product</li>
    <li> I have used several BB creams....   But this is by far the best yet! I put this on and them cover with bronzer</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a real coverage. However, it gives my skin a light and natural coverage which I like.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;ve been using this product forever!</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my skin radiant.  Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  All Youth Code products are awesome!</li>
    <li> It covers my imperfections perfectly!</li>
    <li> This is a great BB cream that keeps my skin looking moisturized and alive.  Others tend to look dull or gray.  This one is my favorite, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
    <li> This is one of, if not my favorite, BB cream I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve worked as a makeup artist, and this provides something you can wear that makes your skin look natural and moisturized. It&#x27;s great as a base for heavier makeup as well. The finish is silky and leaves your skin looking moisturized and dewy, and doesn&#x27;t settle into any wrinkles or pores. I wish they carried them in stores still, and if I remember correctly they used to have Medium Dark as a color choice. Definitely worth the low price if you want natural, even-looking skin.</li>
    <li> Being that it was my 1st time to use a BB cream, I think it&#x27;s good enough for coverage. The last foundation I wore w/ SPF was Clinique, but sinz I&#x27;m acne proned, Ive been using just press powder the past year w/ blush. Although, I still get acne, not a lot, but still annoying all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Good coverage,  I only used 1 app. If u want really really good flawless coverage, then yes, add more w/ press powder. But then, like w/ most foundation, BB or other oil free foundations, most will cause acne, esp. if too hvy make-up. I don&#x27;t think anyone can avoid the dreaded breakouts in their lifetime. I still can get acne even w/o coverage, so its just not make-up that can cause acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did go exercising w/ it, and it was fine, I didn&#x27;t break out on the 1st/2nd time use. W/ the Clinique oil-free foundation, I did. I still use lightly a press powder, BB does hav a mild shine &amp; I like my face w/ less of it, esp living in Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; fit well for my tanned skin, I&#x27;m Filipino, so it blended perfectly. Color looked natural &amp; lasted well throughout the workday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Price was good in comparison to others, $2 cheaper here on Amazon, than Walmt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Mild smell, like most lotions w/spf. The scent dissipates even more if you use powder &amp; blush. I also bought the brand my \\&quot;Etude House BB cream w/ spf 30\\&quot; for comparison &amp; this also has a mild scent. But betwn the 2, I like the Loreal, the color blended way better than Etude&#x27;s one. The Etude looked whiter on me, I mean it was subtle, but it didn&#x27;t look like my natural tanned tone. Also, Loreal is way cheaper. Both had a mild shine, so I still use press powder.</li>
    <li> This Youth Code BB Cream even works for my 74 year old skin and so I intend to repurchase when this tube runs out.</li>
    <li> This has a nice tone to it, it covers well. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is it does settle in the lines but it does smooth out again with a little smoothing of the finger tips. I also think it is heavier than I really like but I do not like to feel anything on my face and it would probably be great for most people weight wise.</li>
    <li> I usually like Loreal products, but this cream is to heavy and the color is unbecoming. It leaves a heavy film on your face. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the only BB cream I use and it is fantastic. The perfect amount coverage.</li>
    <li> okay didn&#x27;t cover as well as I wish it did</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is very difficult to find in stores.  For me it covers just right and leaves a nice feel.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and love it.  It gives me even coverage and SPF protection at the same time.  Wonderful</li>
    <li> The only reason this is getting three stars is because anytime I used it I broke out. I LOVE the product though, it makes me skin glow and look so pretty. It&#x27;s too bad it breaks me out though :/</li>
    <li> I love this product all year &#x27;round, but especially in the summer.  It hides flaws, but doesn&#x27;t look cakey!  It goes on smooth and has several skin correctors in it.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Nice color tone. Smells good and durable. Te skins stay hidratate during all day. Easy to take off.</li>
    <li> I love my &#x27;Age Perfect&#x27; BB cream but this one has color which is good in a pinch without makeup.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product</li>
    <li> After my favorite bb cream, Urban Decay, this one is definitely my second favorite.  I have tried many...Garnier, Avon, Mary Kay, Oil of Olay...and they are not nearly as effective as this one.  It is a little oily which is why I prefer Urban Decay and gave it a 4 star, but for the price, if I wear foundation, I just add a primer and it helps.  If I don&#x27;t wear foundation, I just add a little finishing powder and out the door I go.  love. it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Very good coverage for a light product.  I use it instead of foundation with blush &amp; powder.  I&#x27;ve tried several brands of BB cream, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  I couldn&#x27;t find my color at the local drug store, but no problem getting it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> LOVE the feel on my skin but it&#x27;s a little orange and gives my skin a weird texture. Not very much coverage.</li>
    <li> Stocked up. This product is being discontinued. Not sure what I will do when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great natural coverage</li>
    <li> My niece normally text me but after trying this item she called me to tell me this is the best.  This is what she only uses and not her expensive makeup.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I dont wear foundation or concealer cause its too heavy for my liking. For the people who said it does not cover, put another coat on. I put on two cause i have some pimple scars on my face and it completely covers them. It has a dewy look to it all day, and i dont feel like im wearing makeup at all. Best BB cream out here and better than the high end ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that everyone else has come to in this craze for BB creams - unless they are the Asian kind with whitening agents, they are basically tinted moisturizers. However, I do like this product from L&#x27;Oreal. It has great coverage for being so lightweight, it does have an SPF 15 and it wears for a good long time - I would say about eight to nine hours under makeup and five to six for an event where you&#x27;d be exposed to the elements or working. I have a very physical job and it holds up well for a workday.</li>
    <li> First of all, it was twice as big as I was expecting. This will last me a VERY long time. But most important, of course, is how it works. I got the medium shade, and it&#x27;s perfect. I have nothing negative to say. It has sunscreen, it goes on smoothly. It gives my skin a natural glow. I&#x27;m 57 years old but I think this will work on skin of any age.This is a great product, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I got this because I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person but I have really uneven skintone so I usually need it.&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on I noticed that it did a really good job of making the differences in my skin a bit more even while still showing my freckles which I don&#x27;t like to cover up. It doesn&#x27;t make all your imperfections vanish, but for a one layer application it does a nice job of diminishing them.&lt;br /&gt;I will say the first time I used it it made me break out like all makeup does and caused some dry spots. But I have REALLY sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I put a light layer of moisturizer down first and then the BB cream and it felt like nothing was on my face at all. I didn&#x27;t break out or anything. And after I washed it off for the day my face felt (and still feels) a LOT softer than it usually does. I&#x27;ve got pretty smooth skin, but I&#x27;ve always had little bumps on and directly to the sides of my nose and could never get them to go away, and now they&#x27;re almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say some people may not like the smell. I like it and because my facial wash and moisturizer kind of have weird, bland, old lady smells (because they&#x27;re \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;) once it&#x27;s on my face I can&#x27;t really smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far well worth the $13 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 2 years,</li>
    <li> A few minutes ago I applied this product,- almost immediately my face started to burn and get red. I bought \\&quot;light\\&quot;, it made me look pasty not glowing or \\&quot;illuminated\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve just washed it off but my skin, eyes and lips are still burning.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed. It is leaves my face looking oily. I would not buy this product again Quite shocked  actually. I use Loreals other products beauty products.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, definitely going to buy this product again. And the bottle is huge and will last a very long time!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Been using it for years.  So light but provides great coverage and sun protection.</li>
    <li> this product is ok for me. It is basically a over priced sun screen, I would just use regular sun screen with a dose of fundation and it is the same thing. I may not buy again.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT AND IT WAS THE CHEAPEST WEB SITE I FOUND IT ON AND THE ONE THAT I WANTED .</li>
    <li> I use this BB cream everyday so getting it at a reasonable price is wonderful and fast delivery was great</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product again and again. It is thick, creamy, moisturizing, and leaves a pretty bronzer like tiny on my skin. I use it under make up in the winter and without makeup as a little bit of coverage in the summer.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Started using it a year ago.  My skin looks great.  Love the price.  Gave up on more expensive product.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart for about the same. I&#x27;m 31 and I notice now that I&#x27;m getting a little older my skin doesn&#x27;t look as fresh and clear as it did in my twenties. I don&#x27;t wear makeup to work but I&#x27;m sick of people now asking me if I&#x27;m tired sick or dying!!! This does just the trick. I still use my regular face cream and I also use strivetin which is expensive and when I&#x27;m going out I use regular foundation, but this is perfect for what I wanted. It feels like I have nothing on my face and it evens out my tone and helps with my dark circles. I don&#x27;t use any other makeup products just put a small amount and go. If you touch your face if feels moisturized like youre just wearing face lotion. If youre expecting to look like an airbrushed twenty year old nice try its not a miracle cream for ten bucks. But for the price and what I wanted its prefect.</li>
    <li> While I like the \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; convenience of this BB cream, including the SPF 15, I was unable to find a color match for my light/medium skin tone. I have this BB in both the Light and Medium shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the trouble with the color-matching:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The light is far too pale for me, and looked sort of pasty on the skin. (As if I&#x27;d been ill.)&lt;br /&gt;--The medium is far too dark for me, and looked terribly yellow on the skin. (Jaundice, anyone?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried combining a little of each shade, but the result wasn&#x27;t good there, either. I just ended up with a lighter yellow color, which still (fortunately!) didn&#x27;t match my skin tone. (Fortunately, because light yellow isn&#x27;t what I was after!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, three stars for the convenience, and the fact that it \\&quot;wears-well\\&quot; (as in, it stays put pretty well during all-day wear) But minus 2 stars because of the limited colors and matching problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you don&#x27;t mind experimenting (maybe a friend has some you can try?) you might have better luck with finding the right color.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Gives a night healthy glow ....looks like you&#x27;re not wearing make up!</li>
    <li> loved it got here on time no issues,thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this for an every day sheer but good coverage BB.  It&#x27;s also great as a moisturizer under regular makeup</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a make up wearer, but this balm evens my skin tone, provides sun protection and is twice as big as most beauty balms. This color is right for me, a caucasion with skin that tans easier than most.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream! I have been using it for over a year and I notice that my complexion is clearer and I rarely break out while using this product! It&#x27;s light and easy to use. I can&#x27;t seem to find it locally anymore so I found it a little cheaper on Amazon :-)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like makeup. This product gives my skin a brightness while evening out my skin tone and it lasts all day. I bought this from Amazon because I knew the color that was right for me and the price was considerably less than in the drug store.</li>
    <li> This stuff is THE BOMB!  People ask me frequently how I get my skin to look so fresh and natural, and this is my secret weapon.  I can wear this with or without any other makeup and I look like a younger, more rested version of my real self, mother of 2 young children.  I am not seen in public without it.  I no longer use dept store foundation as I get so many more compliments on my skin when I use just this.</li>
    <li> Great product with great brand</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many tinted moisturizers and BB Creams, and this one is average.  This one is on the thicker side, so if you want more coverage, it is good for that.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the artificial perfume smell.  My skin is combination, and this BB Cream adds some shine (&amp;#34;dewiness&amp;#34; if you want to make it sound nice) so if you are naturally oily you may not like it.  I wouldn&#x27;t repeat this purchase.</li>
    <li> Really Love it! This BB cream made my skin look great  and feel really moisturized. Will definatly buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use this product usually after my daily creams. It is a great alternative for those who do not want to wear make-up and still have a concealer and sunblock.</li>
    <li> Been using for over a year now. It is an all in one makeup and moisturizer but does not feel like makeup and if I don&#x27;t feel like washing it of it does not clog my pores. Loreal Please keep making it just like this. Don&#x27;t change anything !!!  Works great with the Serum Intense as a duo. I am 50 Years old and most think I am in my early 40&#x27;s till they see my kids......</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal BB cream does a great job of smoothing my completion without being heavy (although it is thicker than most BB creams I&#x27;ve seen). Feels great on my skin and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Hard to find item in the medium tone.  It might even be discontinued in the regular department store. I found it here on special with a $50 purchase so I got a couple tubes. I like this better than the Neutregena or Garnier for matching my skin tone. Comparable texture and coverage of the more expensive brands</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I thought it would. I still have to use a highlighter and concealer with it.</li>
    <li> Seems a little drying on the skin.</li>
    <li> Imagine your face covered in lots of oil despite all possible skin exfoliation.  This cream does not do anything good for my skin.  It highlights all the wrinkles and really clogs pores.  After two tries, I had to throw out the entire tube.  Maybe Bb creams are just not my thinkg.  I&#x27;ll stick to traditional Clinique to cover up any imperfections.</li>
    <li> I am at the age when the skin has become thinner, the wrinkles are beginning to become more obvious and inevitable, and hormonal acne is a monthly nuisance. I started researching BB Creams for all the helpful properties being touted: hydration, skin tone correction, sunscreen! True to its proclamations, L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code BB Cream does all of that and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. This is a great multi-tasking, beauty essential and has become part of my daily routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream has proven to be very effective for me. My beauty standard for new products: efficacy, ingredients, cost/value. Some BB creams can be so outrageously expensive, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a small fortune on something still relatively new to the American market. What a value this is! A little goes a long way, the tube size is very generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day, in place of a daytime moisturizer, which in my opinion, is a necessity if you have dry skin like me (wrinkles look deeper when your skin is dry). I like that I can even wear it alone, and forego foundation altogether. I should note hear that the medium tone works well, there&#x27;s no pinky pink undertones. When I do use foundation, I allow the BB cream to dry a few minutes before application. The BB cream helps smoothe out my foundation which I apply with a sponge and I follow up with a powder to tone down any shine. As for the greasy consistency that BB creams or silicone primers purportedly have, I would say L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code BB Cream doesn&#x27;t seem overly so. I am also highly sensitive to heavily scented products, a major turnoff for me no-matter how effective a product can be, and I&#x27;m suffice to say it does not contain anything overpowering or unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit is that it lasts all day. It helps keep the foundation from sliding off your face and gives your face a dewy, luminous, youthful complexion.Having been using this for several weeks, I see a difference in my skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced additional breakouts, as a matter of fact, my breakouts have been minimal! I am utterly amazed at being blemish-free since using this product! I simply love it. I would certainly recommend this product, and will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased it from Walmart but I don&#x27;t see it there anymore. It blends, smoothes, and moisturizes  perfectly.  I was a cosmetics buyer for 5 years and I have tried all the expensive brands......but I prefer this formula.  It is natural looking and light.  I hope they continue production!  I am on my 3rd tube now purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> How is this product still on the market? I&#x27;ve read many reviews about it causing a breakout (after I purchased, of course) and it did the same for me. I have tiny hives covering my entire face and I stopped using this product two days ago. This is not an acne breakout, but terrible hives and even slight puffiness. I&#x27;ve never been allergic to any beauty products, this one seems to contain an ingredient that makes almost half the people who use it have a reaction, which is shocking. L&#x27;Oreal should change the formula or stop making this BB cream, their other BB cream is already fabulous. I&#x27;m so disappointed that I took a risk on L&#x27;Oreal and it didn&#x27;t pan out because I do love their other BB cream so much.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local store because of TV commercials. Not knowing exactly what brand,  I was just looking for BB cream. It feels like lotion on my skin, I have combination of oily and dry skin and this product had fixed this problem instantly within the first day I noticed improvement in my skin consistency. It also has wonderful coverage ( I have not had to use any eye concealer) I have medium tone with olive undertones, although the VB cream didn&#x27;t match my skin exactly it was easy to correct with mineral powder. With on a week I did notice I had small pimples  appeared but quickly went away and have not returned.  Since then I have not had to use add much additional make up. the cream feels so natural that I forget to wash it off at nights and it has not done any harm. this is everything in one.</li>
    <li> This is the best BB cream I have ever used!  And I have used plenty with pricing high and low!  This feels so good on my skin, doesn&#x27;t break it out and looks so natural!  I am SOLD!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product - it feels weightless on your face and blends in really well. I am in my 50&#x27;s and it is perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was expecting but it is ok. I do use it and it does work to a degree. Thanks.</li>
    <li> love this product, just the right amount of color, great moisturizer, and stays all day</li>
    <li> love it and arrived in perfect condition</li>
    <li> It is very thick, the consistency of toothpaste so I use a dab with a bit of water to spread it over.  Nothing special that would make me buy it again.  The medium color looks dark but once applied lightens.</li>
    <li> I purchased this via Amazon Prime in Medium but Fair probably would have been more appropriate.  Since it&#x27;s a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen, it does the job of three products in one, making it easier to get ready to go out, especially when in a hurry.  And, since Medium is a bit too dark for me, it&#x27;s easy to tone it down by applying a small amount of lighter colored makeup. It still feels like nice and light. Plus, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I think it may be ok but as of today - after a month&#x27;s use - I cannot tell any differance</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream because my friends recommended it highly.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and so far I like it.  If I order it again I would order the light shade, but that should have no reflection on the product quality or the provider.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! It feels so good when it goes on, and it doesn&#x27;t have a super heavy coverage and make your face look caked on. I love the way it evens my skin tone without completely demolishing my natural skin. I refuse to buy ANY other BB cream after trying this one, it&#x27;s inexpensive and works so much better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best beauty products I have EVER bought.&lt;br /&gt;Light, covers fairly well for a daytime cover and UV protector - it not for night time make cup foundation but the does job great when I am out gardening or when I need to run to do errands. Put on youth code, some lipstick, a bit of mascara and I feel a made up look in 30 seconds. love this product - smells good, silky, and looks good.</li>
    <li> This product did very little to minimize anything on my skin.  Coverage was non-existant and to top it all off, it has a strong fragrance that irritated my eyes when I put it under my eyes.  Not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thankful to be able to find this foundation cream on Amazon, as it is not available in my local stores.  It is a very thick preparation which I dilute around 50% with SPF 50 sunscreen. Living at my mile high location, this gives sun protection as well as a flawless coverage which lasts all day.  In spite of the name,  it looks very natural on my 70 year old skin.  Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this specifically for my neck area and it does the job.</li>
    <li> I decided on this BB cream because of the price and that it&#x27;s one of the few on the market that claims to not clog pores. I bought the medium shade which is perfect for my olive toned skin, usually drugstore brands are too pink for my complexion but this one matches perfectly. It might be a little on the heavy side for summer if you have oily skin. If you are a non-makeup person like me you will fall in love with this stuff. Its just enough coverage to hide any imperfections but not too much coverage so that you look like a plastic face Kardashian!</li>
    <li> I ordered the medium in this product and it was darker and a little heavier than expected. I try to use sunscreen all the time and that is why I ordered this product ... but I also thought it would have very light coverage (which is what I like) and look natural and I don&#x27;t feel like it reached my expectations. It would be fine for someone with a darker skin who wanted more coverage.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted..it gives me some color very naturally...does not even look like a foundation or anything...it is perfect..non greasy...it is a great product...I will continue buying it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I bought several and they arrived quickly!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product. I have been looking for an oil free, tinted moisturizer for years. The ones I have tried felt thick and greasy on my oily skin. This feels like heaven! Great color and coverage. Nice scent and does not feel heavy. I will stay with this!</li>
    <li> I live in a hot humid climate which keeps my skin fairly well hydrated but after washing my face in the morning it seems a little dry so I have been using only moisturizer plus blusher, mascara, lipstick...since this has a tint to the moisturizer I thought I&#x27;d give it a try (my favorite moisturizer is no longer made and I am running out of what I had socked away)..this had good reviews so I ordered it. It really just gives your skin a little coverage along with the cream which still keeps my skin looking natural. The first day I wore it my daughter-in-law commented that my skin looked really nice (I&#x27;d been staying with her for a few days and this was my first day trying it out--she did not know I even had it with me)...needless to say that remark alone will keep me reordering. (Nice that it is under 3 oz so it can be carried on flights!)&lt;br /&gt;**note** When I originally ordered I ordered medium and the supplier sent me light which I was going to return but instead let my daughter-in-law have since she is much fairer than me. I then reordered the medium and this time the medium arrived** so look carefully when the product arrives to be sure they send the correct color that you ordered (otherwise this would get 5 stars!)</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product.  I use it every day in place of my previous products which has saved me money.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am 56 years old without a whole lot of wrinkles. That being said, every other brand of foundation, and I am talking about the name commercial brands as well as the expensive brands sold at their individual counters in department stores, seemed to find their way into every nook and cranny on my face!. This doesn&#x27;t. It gives an amazingly smooth, even, luminous finish. My nickname by people who know me is &amp;#34;Ms Natural,&amp;#34; so anything that made me look like I was wearing make-up was not a product I would use. I am thrilled with this product and plan to continue to use it. I purchased the Medium shade which matches my skin tone flawlessly. I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
    <li> The coverage is a very smoothing, natural finish,  moisturizers as well throughout day.  It enhances your own skin tones without the &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &amp;#34;wonderful find&amp;#34; for this 73 year old,  thanks L&#x27;Oreal</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I tried this BB cream and i&#x27;m quite satisfied. It feels very pleasant at face as it has very light consistence which gives the feeling of breathing to your skin. It absorbed easily and gave very natural look to the face. color set just perfect. I liked the product and going to buy another one for the future.</li>
    <li> I find the color is too dark for asian.  It makes my face darker and I don&#x27;t dare to wear it outside.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful. I think it&#x27;s the serum that is embedded in the BB cream. It cakey and causes breakouts. It&#x27;s been over a week, and Im still recovering. Gross</li>
    <li> Love this product....wish it was not discontinued!</li>
    <li> Great sheer coverage, not heavy feeling and just great.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS, LOVE IT...</li>
    <li> It was on the shelf at Walgreen&#x27;s, staring at me with a reasonable price and a good-sized 2.5 fl. oz tube.  It was from L&#x27;Oreal, a decent brand, and part of their Youth Code line, which has other products I have used and been satisfied with.  How could I not try a tube?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss, I wish I hadn&#x27;t bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true BB cream will give you \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, minimize skin imperfections, and if good, can even take the place of your foundation.  I had found all these assets in a different L&#x27;Oreal&#x27; product, their Skin Beautifier BB Cream, and thought perhaps their Youth Code  Illuminator SPF 15 version would be even better.  Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this looked natural on me is because it provided no real coverage.  The small variations in my skin color were not evened out by the product.  It went on smoothly, but seemed to disappear with no \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, no color, no illumination as implied in the name, no nothing except the tiniest amount of shine.  As for the possibility of using it with no foundation... nope.  I tried applying a second coat in case more was required for results, but still nada.  Maybe the intention was different, since the packaging refers repeatedly to its sunscreen capabilities... well fine, but then call it a tinted moisturizing sunscreen, don&#x27;t climb on the bandwagon and try to get away with calling it a BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other, superior Skin Beautifier BB Cream (now also being called \\&quot;Studio Secrets\\&quot;) leaves my skin tone even with a subtle pearly finish, minimizes pores, and makes my face look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are experimenting with BB Creams and not looking to fork out a wad of cash for a premium one, I&#x27;d suggest trying the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream.  You might even try the Maybelline (which was ok but too shiny for my taste).  But don&#x27;t let this Youth Code product be your only try of BB creams because there&#x27;s better stuff out there, honest.</li>
    <li> It works well.  I play softball and needed something to protect my skin from the sun and it&#x27;s nice that it works as make-up too.  The bad thing for me is that I have oily skin and just one application has me glowing. I will use it (I am only out there playing ball anyway) but I would not get another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear there is a new one with less oil so I&#x27;ll try that next.</li>
    <li> I have been a LONG TIME user of bareminerals makeup. Although my skin has been very clear my entire life, now that I am older ... I wanted to try something new. I wanted something that had some coverage for the sun spots I now have and that would have sunscreen and that would act like a primer for a more flawless look. I had heard about BB Cream and some of the benefits it had for skin. Of course, I will say my skin is very sensitive and the very slightest product that is too drying WILL cause a breakout as well as any product that is too heavy and oily will cause a breakout. I am asian with NORMAL skin year round except when winter comes around, it can get dry. I honestly was using a face primer prior to my purchase of this and went back to Walmart trying to look for it again. Surely, they did not have what I wanted in stock and I see THIS instead. $13 was no cheap purchase and I was not sure if I wanted to try it especially since I had never heard anything about it before. The first 3 days or so that I used it, I loved the glow of it as well as the coverage. I loved the thick consistency and I LOVE the feminine smell. The only thing I was worried about was I THOUGHT I started getting a few pimples. Not really big or anything but I continued to use it since I did not have anything else and I wanted protection from the sun. It has been 3 weeks and I will say I LOVE it! Other than my skin getting used to the BB Cream and getting but a few pimples that went away quick! My skin is still flawless with NO breakouts! I love the coverage and how I can set my mineral makeup right over it for a matte look or choose to NOT use the mineral makeup and go for the glow! I love the coverage and the scent and the feeling. Now I will say since I NEVER have used foundation for over 12 years, it DOES feel heavy on my skin, heavier than skin primers but when I think about it giving me everything else I want in a bottle, the heaviness of the product doesn&#x27;t even matter to me anymore. Iuse the LIGHT color and it fit me perfect. Of course, after a week at the beach, my color IS a little darker but otherwise, I LOVE this product! I DID see some reviews on Youtube.com about it where some say they don&#x27;t like it. But for someone like me who has extremely sensitive skin and still being able to use it, I LOVE IT! Now I am SCARED to try anything else!</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about BB cream but I found this one to be a little too thick and heavy for my liking.</li>
    <li> Looks great on with no other make up even</li>
    <li> Great coverage that lasts, great moisturizer!  I got the medium, but it was too dark for my skin....the light is a perfect match, and I&#x27;m not a pale person!  maybe the medium will work in with a summer tan!</li>
    <li> Love this instead of heavy foundation.  Two daughters use it also.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin, i don&#x27;t use powder or makeup. So this works great as a SPF and corrects the minor discolorations I have. Normally i just wash my face in the morning, apply this and I am good to go.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and love it.  It smooths out my complexion without looking made up and provides everything else I need for the day including sunscreen and moisturizer.  I use it over a layer of the Youth Code Serum (after letting the serum dry).  I have both shades.  The medium was a little too dark but will be perfect for summer when I get tanner.  The light is perfect for now, in the winter and spring.  I hope this product is around for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, so I have to be careful what I use on it - I don&#x27;t generally wear make-up. This is the first BB cream I have tried and I absolutely loved the glow the first day I used it. I was really excited about the purchase. The second day, however, my face started itching right at my right temple and I got a little pimple - that&#x27;s not a normal trouble spot for me at all, so I know it&#x27;s not just a coincidence. I would highly recommend this product if you do NOT have sensitive skin - if so, you may want to go with something else.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Not available in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this and was excited because I love tinted moisturizers. This applied nicely, gave me a hint of color (though I think a lighter shade would work better for me), covered a few flaws and so on, but the one thing I did not like is its strong scent. I applied, waited, thinking I&#x27;d get used to it, but a while later I could still smell it so I ended up washing it off. If it were unscented or just had a very light fragrance, I&#x27;d give it a higher rating, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to that sort of thing -- and I am -- it&#x27;s too much. If they ever release an unscented version, though, I think I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
    <li> Love the light coverage and darker color.  Brightens my skin with a natural look plus my pores diminish.  Plus it is creamy and moisturizing to my 55 year old skin.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin looks but it leaves your skin really wet it does not dry up ..</li>
    <li> Product good and received  on time</li>
    <li> This was a very thick and heavy makeup, not a light sheer sunscreen with a hint of color. There is an Australian brand called SunSense that makes a wonderful tinted, &amp;#34;anti-age&amp;#34; sunscreen, which, alss, is not available in the US (without paying about $20 for shipping from AU).</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading about it in a magazine. It works well for the price. It&#x27;s difficult to tell which color I should be using, so I think the color I got was a little darker than I needed, but hopefully I&#x27;ll get a tan and it will be even. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling it locally, I really love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong item - it was a shade off. I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; or just passed over. Once shade has been determined, it&#x27;s a nice reasonably priced item. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not only did mine not arrive in a sealed package but it looked melted and smelled HORRIBLE1 the sunscreen scent on it is too strong and almost unbearable :( HATE THIS BB CREAM! I feel like fried chicken with oil all over my face when i wear this! lol , No but really!  It&#x27;s horrible!</li>
    <li> Nice cool creamy moisturizer. Not as much coverage as I&#x27;d like though.</li>
    <li> I love, love love this product and don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in the stores. It is light, doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs, makes my skin look as close to porcelain as it ever has and who knows what other good it might be doing. I appreciate the SPF, too.</li>
    <li> This has lasted me a month and I love it! It gives you an all over covered without the heavy weight some foundations give you. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Leaves this glow to your face. Not much coverage but I love the natural look of this BB cream. Great for daytime or if you just want a nice finish without much coverage.</li>
</ol>
