      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!  </li>
      <li>I am not a makeup person; but this is very easy to use and covers well.  </li>
      <li>It was a gift for my wife so far so good she loves it!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and the kit comes with great instructions (</li>
      <li>well I&#x27;m telling you, it was a total cinch and my face looked AMAZING!!!!-</li>
      <li>(I understand not being able to return make up....</li>
      <li>i chose this brand because it had the best reviews on multiple</li>
      <li>so most liquid foundations I have tried collect in the pores.  </li>
      <li>The standard make up with the kit is not the best</li>
      <li>and then probably i will be able to review.</li>
      <li>So I decided I&#x27;d give Dinair one more chance.</li>
      <li>I would like to use it more</li>
      <li>As of today i love it</li>
      <li>I love this awesome item, i used for special occasions and i am very happy with my purchase, it May be a little pricey but is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Clean it out immediately after use though!  </li>
      <li>The Dinair Airbrush Makeup Kit Pro Edition is a great product for those wanting a professional look.  </li>
      <li>Compact, easy to use</li>
      <li>By way of a disclaimer, the product was easy to use and if you don&#x27;t mind a lot of make up, it might work for you.</li>
      <li>Applying the foundation and blush is easy as pie.</li>
      <li>i ran to the car afterwards and looked in the mirror and was THRILLED to discover that my foundation was still EXACTLY as i had applied it-</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, goes on exactly as it says it will.</li>
      <li>a HUGE issue - Dinair solved it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>In my opinion if you just want a brush free way to apply your make up dinar will work just as well and avoid any of the oils or germs spreading onto your face.  </li>
      <li>After reading the return policy with great care and following EVERY step needed, I still had to contact the company after the &amp;#34;6 weeks&amp;#34; to refund me.</li>
      <li>The makeup goes on lightly with the Dinair tool.</li>
      <li>water-I&#x27;m Celiac-need Gluten Free</li>
      <li>What a fabulous product - you will not be disappointed!!purchase this.</li>
      <li>Clean-up is quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>Originally I thought it was the airbrush</li>
      <li>it came with, but was so excited to try this that i decided to wing it-</li>
      <li>So glad I read them because I got the right one first</li>
      <li>It is very cute (I received the sparkly red airbrish) however....</li>
      <li>It is absolutely worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Where have you been all of my adult life??&amp;#34; This system is absolutely phenomenal.</li>
      <li>but it is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>It is absolutely worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing Bare Minerals for years and have loved it, but the brushes get build-up on them very easy and while I clean them regularly, I don&#x27;t have time to deep clean my brushes after every use</li>
      <li>but I love knowing my stuff is clean and sterile for the next time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>Even the eye shadow is easy, I did a pretty decent job</li>
      <li>i cannot believe that i actually chose the right colour of foundation on top of it-</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll be trying a higher quality make up.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ll admit it, I didn&#x27;t believe all the hype at first.</li>
      <li>My first reaction after I used this was &amp;</li>
      <li>Thanks, Dinair!</li>
      <li>my first try.</li>
      <li>While they are nice and friendly on the phone, they will do very little to compensate the customer for their product&#x27;s lack of quality.</li>
      <li>Make sure you clean out your system after every use, it take a few minutes</li>
      <li>I am a senior citizen with some wrinkling and large pores and acne scars from my youth</li>
      <li>At a certain point you just feel caked.</li>
      <li>and it works very well on my wrinkles.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t cover very well, and it also stings your skin if you apply too much.</li>
      <li>I had to use too much cover to make it work</li>
      <li>then she said \\&quot;wait, your face looks very smooth\\&quot;-</li>
      <li>You really have to clean it well after each use, and you can only use airbrush makeup w it!!</li>
      <li>like most other reviews have said...</li>
      <li>So if you are simply looking at this product for the brush free aspect if you have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re hesitating, if you&#x27;re saying &amp;#34;this won&#x27;t work for me,&amp;#34; or even if you like your current make-up system but want to try something different, something more &amp;#34;natural feeling&amp;#34;,</li>
      <li>It takes some practice to learn how to use it and mix the colors for your particular skin tone</li>
      <li>All I really want is a product that works, and this is clearly something Dinair cannot deliver.</li>
      <li>worth the BIG price tag!!!</li>
      <li>She INSISTED that I just wait for her to send me the new makeup.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t live up to its hype.  </li>
      <li>i checked out several airbrush brands and bought this one because of all the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>Slightly time consuming though as you have to clean it everything you use it.</li>
      <li>and  how natural the color is.</li>
      <li>Dinair has given me a soft silky look and the blush gives me a modest glow without the clownish streaks of brush applied makeup.  </li>
      <li>It is not very complicated to learn, but takes WAY longer for me than applying regular make up.</li>
      <li>I have had seasonal/hormonal acne for a long time, and while it&#x27;s not god-awful, who wants to see that on their face?</li>
      <li>Well after using the new airbrush I was still having the same problems.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Dinair was the first to make the airbrush make-up system, so that&#x27;s why I am trusting them with my business over the other brands.</li>
      <li>i kept dabbing at my face worried that my face was \\&quot;running\\&quot;- the other dog walker was looking at me funny</li>
      <li>As far as the actual airbrush machine goes, I was also unimpressed.  </li>
      <li>I called the other day because I wanted to return the whole system.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I just bought it and used it for practicing. I would like to use it more and then probably i will be able to review. As of today i love it</li>
    <li> Easy to use, coverage is great and I looked younger instantly! Would strongly recommend this product to everyone wanting a great airbrush system! I am a first time user and have tried others in stores and this one is the least complicated one I have found!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!  It takes some practice to learn how to use it and mix the colors for your particular skin tone but it is well worth it.  I am a senior citizen with some wrinkling and large pores and acne scars from my youth so most liquid foundations I have tried collect in the pores.  Dinair has given me a soft silky look and the blush gives me a modest glow without the clownish streaks of brush applied makeup.  My young daughter also is crazy about the eye makeup and has become a real artist with it.  Thanks, Dinair!</li>
    <li> I love this awesome item, i used for special occasions and i am very happy with my purchase, it May be a little pricey but is worth the money.</li>
    <li> 1st time tried it , started clogging,  clogs every time.. makeup makes my  eyes water-I&#x27;m Celiac-need Gluten Free, I feel like Wholesaler has been playing a cat and mouse game with me on getting it returned... Including trying to charge me restock fee of 20% even though product is defective...</li>
    <li> Some of the foundation bottles came unsealed, therefore, they&#x27;ve been used and contaminated. I&#x27;ve contacted the vendor and told them about it and I was ignored. I had to follow up to take care of it so it took months. Also, the foundation was dry on the face. If you used the oil your face comes out shiny. Dinair is not returnable as per the vendor. I&#x27;m very disappointed about this product and the vendor.</li>
    <li> This is the airbrush system to get. There are ads for &#x27;the other one&#x27;, but the forums for that one warn you off. So glad I read them because I got the right one first and it cost me less on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Since day 1 I have been having troubles with my system. Originally I thought it was the airbrush so I had it replaced. Well after using the new airbrush I was still having the same problems. I called the other day because I wanted to return the whole system. I couldn&#x27;t get the makeup to spray out evenly, it was a nightmare using the thing. The lady on the phone informed me that there was a bad batch of makeup that went out and that was probably my problem. I told her I didn&#x27;t care, I was already too frustrated with it. I wanted to be done with it and proceed with the return process. She INSISTED that I just wait for her to send me the new makeup. So I decided I&#x27;d give Dinair one more chance. Tonight I sat down with my new makeup expecting the worst. But let me tell you! I am SO impressed with my airbrush now. The difference in the new makeup is extreme. I am very pleased and can say I am now a happy customer! I really just wish I was notified about the bad makeup so I could have been saved from the past few weeks of frustration. Otherwise, the thing is amazing. Applying the foundation and blush is easy as pie. Even the eye shadow is easy, I did a pretty decent job my first try. The only thing that&#x27;s tricky is eyeliner, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to freehand that though, if you use the eyebrow stencils it&#x27;s way easier.&lt;br /&gt;The actual system itself deserves 5 stars. But because of the bad batch of makeup I received and wasn&#x27;t notified of until I was ready to return the thing I&#x27;m taking one away :)</li>
    <li> After reading the return policy with great care and following EVERY step needed, I still had to contact the company after the &amp;#34;6 weeks&amp;#34; to refund me. Not only did I pay $18.10 to return it (for a signed confirmation and insurance), I paid for the shipping to me and was told that they were going to charge me a 15 percent restocking fee! I spent over $70.00 for this and I never even used the thing. I also got a rude message from them telling me that I was in the wrong because I was asking where my money was after 6 weeks.Quote &amp;#34;We can only assume you didn&#x27;t read the portion that states your refund would be issued within 4 to 6 &amp;#34;business&amp;#34; weeks.&amp;#34;  Even so I had my e-mail saying they go it, the confirmation from the post office that it was signed for over 6 weeks before I wrote them. June 14th was the day it was mailed the 18th was the day it was signed for, the day I wrote them was July 31st. 6 weeks and a few days!  Amazing how and I quote &amp;#34;At your demand, we have since escalated your return for you and it has passed inspection. You will be receiving your refund shortly. Also, Amazon allows up to a 20% restocking fee.  We are only charging a 15% restocking fee&amp;#34;. DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE RIPPED OFF AND INSULTED!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and works great.  Dinair customer services is wonderful and very helpful and prompt</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and this is a great buy! I have purchased others and this one worked the same if not better than more expensive machines! Great for beginners! It sends you the tutorial dvd and walks you through everything! Clean it out immediately after use though!  it will clog.</li>
    <li> i just received my airbrush kit today- i chose this brand because it had the best reviews on multiple websites- well i have never airbrushed in my life, nor seen it done- i have never even worn foundation before- i didn&#x27;t have a chance to put the dvd in to watch the instructional video it came with, but was so excited to try this that i decided to wing it- well I&#x27;m telling you, it was a total cinch and my face looked AMAZING!!!!- i cannot believe that i actually chose the right colour of foundation on top of it- no idea how that is possible.... lol- just held up the bottles and chose what looked like the best match....- i even did the blush air brush and even though i screwed that up a bit, i just took a cotton ball and kind of dabbed up my mistakes and voila, not 5 minutes later, my face looked SOOOOO GOOD!!!!- i asked my tween daughter (who did not know i bought this device) if she noticed anything different about me- she said that she could tell something was different but couldn&#x27;t tell what- then she said \\&quot;wait, your face looks very smooth\\&quot;- i was happy to hear that!- then i took our son to soccer- it was raining tonight and i decided to bring our dog and jog around the track while he practiced- i met another dog walker and we started talking- i was sweating profusely from the jogging and the hot muggy rain and all of a sudden i felt very self-conscious that my foundation was streaking and must look awful- i kept dabbing at my face worried that my face was \\&quot;running\\&quot;- the other dog walker was looking at me funny and i thought \\&quot;oh great! i must look ridiculous! what would possess me to put on full make-up before going for a jog in the rain???\\&quot; - but you will not believe it!!!- i ran to the car afterwards and looked in the mirror and was THRILLED to discover that my foundation was still EXACTLY as i had applied it- how was that possible????? i could not believe it!!!! VERY VERY happy with this product!!!!! the ease of use and the quality of longevity of wear are JUST AMAZING!!! thank-you!!!! PS- when i looked in the mirror, i saw what the other dog walker must have been looking at: my black eye liner was dripping profusely down my cheeks!!! i actually looked like alice cooper!!! lol -anyhow, amazing product!! worth the BIG price tag!!!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife so far so good she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> The hardware itself is very good, the instructions were very good, the DVD was super helpful!  The standard make up with the kit is not the best, I&#x27;ll be trying a higher quality make up.</li>
    <li> It is too hard to use and goes on like mud on your face and a complete waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, goes on exactly as it says it will. Slightly time consuming though as you have to clean it everything you use it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make up, so I was hoping this product would cover the minor discolorations on my face. I had to use too much cover to make it work and then it felt too thick and looked it. By way of a disclaimer, the product was easy to use and if you don&#x27;t mind a lot of make up, it might work for you.</li>
    <li> i checked out several airbrush brands and bought this one because of all the positive reviews.  I am very pleased that i did.  I am not a makeup person; but this is very easy to use and covers well.  I am 65+ and it works very well on my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The Dinair Airbrush Makeup Kit Pro Edition is a great product for those wanting a professional look.  The makeup goes on lightly with the Dinair tool. Clean-up is quick and easy.  I am impressed how smooth my face looks and  how natural the color is. It was a delightful \\&quot;find\\&quot; for me.</li>
    <li> It is very cute (I received the sparkly red airbrish) however....like most other reviews have said...it doesn&#x27;t live up to its hype.  It is not very complicated to learn, but takes WAY longer for me than applying regular make up. And doesnt look that great.&lt;br /&gt;The dinair make up provided doesn&#x27;t cover very well, and it also stings your skin if you apply too much. I tested the make up before fully applying to avoid any allergic reaction, but it did not matter. I still felt a slight burn once I fully the make up on. I have a feeling this vendor just bought a bunch a long time ago and is peddling old make up..... I will not bother with a return, as Returns are not accepted.... even though technically the make up and applicator do not touch your skin. (I understand not being able to return make up....but this should be an exception....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion, It is way too expensive to waste your money on.</li>
    <li> My first reaction after I used this was &amp;#34;Oh hello perfect skin! Where have you been all of my adult life??&amp;#34; This system is absolutely phenomenal. And I&#x27;ll admit it, I didn&#x27;t believe all the hype at first. To say I was slightly skeptical in the beginning when I ordered this would be an understatement; I was convinced I would hate it, that i wouldn&#x27;t have the coverage i needed/wanted, that color matching was going to be too difficult, and that overall this would be a rip-off. NOT SO!! I have had seasonal/hormonal acne for a long time, and while it&#x27;s not god-awful, who wants to see that on their face? I even have a few minor scars on my chin and cheek. I have been wearing Bare Minerals for years and have loved it, but the brushes get build-up on them very easy and while I clean them regularly, I don&#x27;t have time to deep clean my brushes after every use - do you? I could also never attain that &amp;#34;flawless finish&amp;#34; I craved. I&#x27;ve even tried $60 concealers to cover up my acne and scars in addition to Bare Minerals...never enough. At a certain point you just feel caked. :/ This airbrush system eliminates all of those issues; I especially love its sterility. You&#x27;re not tranfering the bacteria from your skin on to your make-up applicator (like with brushes), and for those of us who suffer with acne, that is a HUGE issue - Dinair solved it!&lt;br /&gt;Dinair was the first to make the airbrush make-up system, so that&#x27;s why I am trusting them with my business over the other brands. It&#x27;s super easy to use and the kit comes with great instructions (but I just looked up a few youtube videos). Make sure you clean out your system after every use, it take a few minutes but I love knowing my stuff is clean and sterile for the next time.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitating, if you&#x27;re saying &amp;#34;this won&#x27;t work for me,&amp;#34; or even if you like your current make-up system but want to try something different, something more &amp;#34;natural feeling&amp;#34;, something CLEANER, oh my goodness please purchase this. It is absolutely worth every penny. What a fabulous product - you will not be disappointed!!purchase this. It is absolutely worth every penny. What a fabulous product - you will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> You really have to clean it well after each use, and you can only use airbrush makeup w it!! Compact, easy to use</li>
    <li> In my opinion if you just want a brush free way to apply your make up dinar will work just as well and avoid any of the oils or germs spreading onto your face.  Airbrush also can have a lighter feel than average liquid foundation, depending on how much you need to apply.  Overall though I would not say that this system or product lives up to the hype. Your skin will still look like your skin. As far as the actual airbrush machine goes, I was also unimpressed.  The pen continually clogs and wastes makeup.  I cleaned my every time before use and after use and still had issues. So if you are simply looking at this product for the brush free aspect if you have sensitive skin it may be worth it, otherwise, not a good buy.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend Dinair. Since I purchased this product just over a year ago, I&#x27;ve had to return 2 defective airbrushes, and now the compressor has stopped working. Dinair&#x27;s customer service is lacking. While they are nice and friendly on the phone, they will do very little to compensate the customer for their product&#x27;s lack of quality. All I really want is a product that works, and this is clearly something Dinair cannot deliver.</li>
