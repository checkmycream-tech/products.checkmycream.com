### Positive Reviews

      <li>it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  </li>
      <li>Regarding skin type, this is obviously best on people with oily skin and combo skin (that&#x27;s me).</li>
      <li>It really is great!</li>
      <li>For best results:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>

      <li>The product somehow works, but you have to have an incredible patience to do anything.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>The name of this product should be the Deluxe Rechargeable Welt Maker.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, after one use I can feel my skin get smoother as the surface dirt are sucked</li>
      <li>I wrote a review on the Panasonic portable water pik which is also excellent and can be used to clean this unit easily.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I bought this product expecting it to work okay, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything spectacular.  </li>

      <li>so I&#x27;m pleased and think it works well.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad I purchased the product.  </li>
      <li>It delivers on all it&#x27;s promises and more.</li>
      <li>I received the pore cleanser in the mail today and I love it.  </li>
      <li>A scrub or any cream suppressing the developement of acne would do much better.</li>
      <li>Biore strips are better than this product.  </li>
      <li>It is just better than squeezing it out and or using stripes.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really get any great results with this product.</li>
      <li>Also, I just found out yesterday that the thing does not want to work any more.</li>
      <li>For me, it works a lot better than the Boire strips.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>Particularly satisfying when cleaning the device, since all the crud off my face was visible.&lt;br /&gt;Visible decrease in size and number of visible pores and blackheads after 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t get it all taken care of in one use, but you will notice an improvement that just gets better with more use.</li>
      <li>It is also more effective if you lightly resoap and rinse after use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>yea, (as recommended) make sure you steam your face or shower before trying/using this product.</li>
      <li>but a mosquito does a better suction job on my skin that this gadget.</li>
      <li>I have removed whiteheads from my chin that I have had for more than 15 years.  </li>
      <li>Okay... I read all the reviews before purchasing this item ~1.5 months ago.  </li>
      <li>A home treatment with this is fun--especially the misty part, and your skin feels very clean.  </li>
      <li>My face felt very clean.  </li>
      <li>I used it for the first time this morning as I am leaving for a vacation and thought it&#x27;ll  make me look good in my vacation.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I was able to return it for a refund.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how it works long-term, but so far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;THE BEST [money]I EVER SPENT!</li>
      <li>It comes w/ a mounting rack which is ok if you you&#x27;ve got lots of accessible wall studs in your bathroom.</li>
      <li>Full results require use for about 3 weeks every 3 days!  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The moist spray is useless.&lt;br /&gt;The directions also tell you that if your skin is &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot; you will get bruised easily.  </li>
      <li>The suction is strong (I even managed to get some purple spots on my face)and</li>
      <li>You just need to warm and wash your face first in the shower and use it in the shower.  </li>
      <li>My teenage daughter wasn&#x27;t happy with it either.</li>
      <li>I found this easy to clean even without the water pik and don&#x27;t know why they include the cleaning brush with it.</li>
      <li>*does* loosen blackheads--in fact, it&#x27;s a great complement to a Biore regimen when used regularly.</li>
      <li>I needed a more economical solution and this is what I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for removing white heads/</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s not an extractor, for that your better off getting a metal extractor (revlons it&#x27;s not too hot,</li>
      <li>(b/c they&#x27;re worth it!), or use clay/mud masks and Biore strips.</li>
      <li>The results are completely worth it!</li>
      <li>It will, however, clean the oil that causes blackheads from your pores.</li>
      <li>It didnot clean my pores as promised.</li>
      <li>you can clean the cap by q-tips even.</li>
      <li>One more important note: It also says on the package that you need to use it for a month in order to really get all the blackheads clean.</li>
      <li>I was expecting this thing to help clean out blackheads...</li>
      <li>it did clean my face.</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s kind of cool to vacuum up all that excess oily junk on your nose.</li>
      <li>after all, it is a \\&quot;pore cleanser\\&quot; and it&#x27;s got a special attachment just for the nose...</li>
      <li>You have to use it routinely, creatively, and patiently to see real results.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this pore cleaner.  </li>
      <li>Not to discount the power of this Pore Cleanser, but in order to get the full benefits of this unit, you have to be:&lt;br /&gt;1) patient</li>
      <li>advertising on the packaging promises a lot more than this delivers... there should be  a disclaimer that it doesn&#x27;t work on all people, if it even really works at all.</li>
      <li>The manufacturer&#x27;s claim that you will see an 80% reduction with these skin problems is absolutely true.</li>
      <li>I wet my face at the sink for a few minutes with warm water and use it, and it works fine, but it works best after/during taking a shower or a bath.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s logical to assume that if you bruise easy this product may not be for you.  </li>
      <li>Make sure your face is wet/moist with the warm water before you begin (not too wet).  </li>
      <li>It can cause purple spots after using but it goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>Lucky me, I happened to place the order twice, so</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that buying this product was such a good idea, based on the reviews posted here, so I was very sceptical when I used it for the first time.</li>
      <li>I have now been using it for 4 months and my blackheads have been greatly reduced and are less noticable.  </li>
      <li>You have to spend about an hour the first time you use it, trying the different motions on areas of your face and applying different amounts of pressure in order to find out what works best for you.</li>
      <li>However, folks with dry skin could still use it and enjoy it as it gives the face a nice massage and toning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I think this is a little more effective than a nose strip.</li>
      <li>I still have it-if anyone wants it, can give it for free.</li>
      <li>Particularly satisfying when cleaning the device, since all the crud off my face was visible.&lt;br /&gt;Visible and marked decrease in size and number of visible pores and blackheads after 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>and I think the results have been well worth the effort.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this years ago. Have used only x2 in the past 10 years. Reason is because it doesnt clean any pores, suction is too weak. I still have it-if anyone wants it, can give it for free.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that buying this product was such a good idea, based on the reviews posted here, so I was very sceptical when I used it for the first time. Honestly, it does work for me. The suction is strong (I even managed to get some purple spots on my face)and it did clean my face. On top of that, the suction had the effect of a good facial massage, which I would think will be beneficial on long run. I guess with a regular use there will be an improvement in the skin condition. However, if you expect that all blackheads will be gone with the first use, you will be disappointed. &lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like is the way the pore cleanser works in the shower. It was almost impossible to slide it on my face and the experience wasn&#x27;t very pleasant. &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am really happy that I have it and I would recommend it to anyone, who doesn&#x27;t have the time or $ to have this done professionally.</li>
    <li> Unless your face oil is naturally oozing without you doing anything (that is if you are beyond redemption)MAYBE you&#x27;ll see some dirt sucked up by this machine. Also be careful about the purple spots. Frankly speaking you can see better results if you just use traditional methods (yeah, go infront of a mirror and squeeze)&lt;br /&gt;I would keep my money, buy other hand held black spot extracting instruments, (such as the one your dermatalogist is using, a 4-5 inch thin metal stick with a tiny metal loop attached at the end) which would cost at most 4-5 bucks and give that a try first.&lt;BR&gt;I bought this for my sister and my mom also tried it they are both extremely dissatisfied. I do the nose squeezing now and then, and I tried this too, only once, thinking that this may be a more scientific approach. Nah!&lt;BR&gt;Listen to me,  use a soda straw and keep your money.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing this product.  Some said the suction was too strong, some said it was too weak ... I only needed it for my T-zone -- which is a rather new phenomena to me and I don&#x27;t know how to use my finger nails to squeeze it -- so I decided to give it a try anyways.&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely flawed, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the suction&#x27;s strength.  It&#x27;s like the first car ever built ... it just needs to get modified to work better.&lt;br /&gt;* The suction cup for the nose is still too big.&lt;br /&gt;* The cups are difficult to clean (and the small brush provided is absolutely useless).&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s not suitable for dry or normal-dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you read the directions, it tells you to use it after shower when the sin has soaked and is still a bit moist.  I have normal skin type, but it gets dehydrated after being washed and so I normally use moisturizer right after washing my face (or my skin will feel tight). It will immediately stop working when my skin dries, which is pretty quick.&lt;br /&gt;* The moist spray is useless.&lt;br /&gt;The directions also tell you that if your skin is &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot; you will get bruised easily.  They&#x27;re not kidding!!  I got so bruised that no amount of foundation was going to cover it and I had to go to work with mosquito-bite-look-alikes all over my chin and nose.&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pulled gunk out of my pores, but also broke capilliaries. If you are at all prone to spider veins and broken capilliaries on your face, avoid this product.</li>
    <li> The name of this product should be the Deluxe Rechargeable Welt Maker.  That&#x27;s really all it does.  It just broke the blood vessels on my face where I used it and didn&#x27;t seem to cleanse at all.  I&#x27;d steer clear of this product at all costs.  Unless, of course, you like having little reddish blue marks on your face for several days after its use.  (Yes, I tried using it after steaming my skin.  Yes, I used at various times of the day.  No, I did not find any good qualities about this contraption)</li>
    <li> This product is waste of money for me. It didnot clean my pores as promised. It was not even able to remove my white heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this because I am really surprised by how many people are not happy with this product. It really is great! I would guess that those who were not happy with it weren&#x27;t patient enough with it. You have to spend about an hour the first time you use it, trying the different motions on areas of your face and applying different amounts of pressure in order to find out what works best for you. I wet my face at the sink for a few minutes with warm water and use it, and it works fine, but it works best after/during taking a shower or a bath. This product totally beats boiling water and using a blemish extractor to get rid of your blackheads. And, it&#x27;s cheaper than buying tons of those Biore strips and it works even better. I used the pore cleaner on my husband, and he even likes it! One more important note: It also says on the package that you need to use it for a month in order to really get all the blackheads clean. I&#x27;d say it took about 2 weeks on me. From what I have read in the other reviews, the folks who didn&#x27;t like this product expected perfection in one use. You won&#x27;t get it all taken care of in one use, but you will notice an improvement that just gets better with more use. Regarding skin type, this is obviously best on people with oily skin and combo skin (that&#x27;s me). However, folks with dry skin could still use it and enjoy it as it gives the face a nice massage and toning. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have had a constant battle with minor blackheads appearing on my nose, cheeks and chin for 15 years.  I&#x27;ve tried the Biore strips, deep cleansing, etc. and nothing really seemed to make a long-term difference.  I bought this product because, well, nothing else had worked so why not give something totally different a try?  I&#x27;m so happy I took the chance.  As other reviewers have noted, this product will not provide an immediate fix. But, used every few days over the course of time it will.  I noticed a difference in about 2 weeks.  I have now been using it for 4 months and my blackheads have been greatly reduced and are less noticable.  I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve seen about an 80% reduction.  There are still a few, but they are much smaller and I still have hope that with continued use they too will be gone eventually. I also believe that if I stopped using it regularly my blackheads would come back.  It&#x27;s the constant deep-cleaning of the skin that makes this product work.  However, it only takes a few minutes every other night and I think the results have been well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re the type who loves to stare at the sickeningly immediate gratification of a freshly peeled Biore strip, dirty a/c filter, or the bottom of your Swiffer---stick to the Biore.  Not to discount the power of this Pore Cleanser, but in order to get the full benefits of this unit, you have to be:&lt;br /&gt;1) patient&lt;br /&gt;2) diligent&lt;br /&gt;3) willing to face the fact that after steps 1 and 2, that you may not see any fruits of labor (i.e. suctioned blackheads)right after using the thing. When do see gunk, it&#x27;s usually a small amount of oil congealed to the side of the cup. It will NEVER, ever be the \\&quot;massive forestation\\&quot; that is revealed on a Biore strip.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s weigh the options here---to properly use this Pore Cleanser, you have to hold the suction cup against your nose for 10-30 seconds or as you deem comfortable (some skins can take more suction time, others can&#x27;t). But being that the oval nose cup is a mere diameter of your pinky nail, consider the amount of surface area that you have to cover. Take that small measurement, factor in the amount of skin that you need to cover/massage and multiply the necessary seconds per square acreage----you are literally standing there forever in front of your bathroom mirror counting, \\&quot;1...2....3....4.....\\&quot; and then moving the cup to a new location, only to count again.  And again. Hey more power to you if you have this patience, but i&#x27;ve got lots of pores, and unfortunately very little time.  I&#x27;d rather slap on a Biore and surf the web in my PJ&#x27;s.  Faster, quicker, and much more gratifying for comparatively little invested energy.&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that this Pore Cleanser *does* loosen blackheads--in fact, it&#x27;s a great complement to a Biore regimen when used regularly. And that&#x27;s why I still keep it. But used alone--it&#x27;s not strong enough, requires too much time, and is simply not satisfying in our immediate-gratification world. We as humans like to SEE our deforested results. Especially for all that hard work, it&#x27;s gotta be big payola!  Small dribs and drabs of oil just don&#x27;t seem to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;And as for the \\&quot;misting\\&quot; option--this is so dumb. The mist expels out of the same hole which inhales your nose dirt. To avoid regreasing yourself with your bodily oils, you have to wash out the cup or switch it to the other side first. A small qualm, yes, but a pet peeve of mine.g payola!  Small dribs and drabs of oil just don&#x27;t seem to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;And as for the \\&quot;misting\\&quot; option--this is so dumb.

    <li> A home treatment with this is fun--especially the misty part, and your skin feels very clean.  You just have to take the time to pamper yourself. I&#x27;ll include guys here also--esp. if you have oily skin problems. I got some exfoliation. It&#x27;s best used with a lighted magnifying mirror, so be brave if you&#x27;re over 40 and you see your &amp;quot;character lines.&amp;quot;&lt;BR&gt;It can be used too forcefully and you&#x27;ll look bruised, as they warn you.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this pore cleaner.  It delivers on all it&#x27;s promises and more. I started out using the Igea pore cleaner and could not have been more disappointed--the suction was half as powerful as the Panasomic model, it ran on batteries instead of being rechargeable, the nose and face cups were smaller, and it didn&#x27;t have variable suction.  Not to mention it broke after I used it twice. The Panasonic pore cleaner, however, works beautifully after having used it many times. The horrid pores on my nose have never been cleaner or smaller.&lt;br /&gt;There is a couple of things I suggest to help get the most use out of the pore cleaner--use it in the shower (as suggested in the instructions, the warmth and steam really does open your pores)and once finished with the pore cleaner use a facial cleanser designed to help clean pores (not necessary at all, the pore cleaner does perfectly well on it&#x27;s own but it helps).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great results using the device to remove the sebum in the pores on my nose. Note that I have only had success when using it in the shower. On dry skin, nada. But in the shower, after I&#x27;ve washed my face (and my pores have had a chance to start to open under the warm water), I use it like a vacuum cleaner (rub back and forth, trying not to lose suction) and when I&#x27;m done, the plastic end is filled with sebum. Eeew...But, hey, instant gratification. Works like a charm. When I get out of the shower, I see lots of open pores on my nose...For me, it works a lot better than the Boire strips.&lt;br /&gt;Note that I have only had success with this device on my nose, and on the areas of my face which border my nose. I have had no success elsewhere on my face, probably because the other areas of my face are dryer.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, it is not clear to me if it&#x27;s actually of any value. Sure, it&#x27;s kind of cool to vacuum up all that excess oily junk on your nose. But I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in how often I get the occasional zit, for example.&lt;br /&gt;So although I keep using it, I am not sure why, except that it&#x27;s kind of fun...&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
    <li> The product did not have enough suction&lt;BR&gt;to pull anything from my or my wife&#x27;s pores.</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic Pore Cleanser on a whim and have never regretted it!  Within a month my skin improved beyond anything I could have hoped for.  I have seen other reviews stating that the suction is either too strong or too weak (for this I recommend keeping it in the charger at all times as it does lose strength as the power runs down) and that it didn&#x27;t work for them for various other reasons and all I can say is that I experienced none of these things.  In terms of skin care it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  The instructions were very simple and after the first month I discovered a trick that increased the effectiveness even more dramatically, and I think would improve results for anyone who uses it.  I use the Pore Cleanser for five or so minutes in a hot shower directly following a moderate workout several times a week.  It&#x27;s fairly straight forward.  When you exercise and your body heats to the point that it begins to sweat the pores open which fairly obviously would make it easier for the Pore Cleanser to work.  I&#x27;ve found that exercise is a far more effective technique in getting my pores to open than standing in a hot shower or using one of those facial steaming things; however I&#x27;m sure that those improve results as well.  Whatever you do, even if you aren&#x27;t getting any results at all, don&#x27;t give up without at least trying this method.  The results are completely worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a facial product junkie, and when I came across this pore cleanser, I was elated. However, once I received it, I believe I only used it a few times. I was discouraged by the lack of any visual results, and I gave up on the product. I also read that products that use a suction action can actually HARM the skin due to the constant pulling of the skin. So, it may actually CAUSE wrinkles in the long run! So, stick to professional facials if you can afford them (b/c they&#x27;re worth it!), or use clay/mud masks and Biore strips.</li>
    <li> My fiancee and I found this to be ineffective on either of our faces at removing either oil or blackheads.   Nice construction and easy operation, but unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work as advertised...went right back to the store.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting one of these from the moment they were first on the shelves, but I waited a year for the prices to go down. I&#x27;m so glad - because I threw away [a small amount] instead of [the big bucks]! Gee... I wonder why the price has dropped so much since it came out? Could it be because it doesn&#x27;t work?&lt;br /&gt;It looks impressive, but the suction action simply isn&#x27;t effective. I tried using it for weeks and finally realized I was just massaging my face and nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the mix of reviews, I wonder if those with positive experiences got newer models than I did... I have had mine for about a year. I wonder if Panasonic improved the suction power a bit after hearing negative feedback to help the product?&lt;br /&gt;Or, it is also possible that not all people can be helped by this product... could be that I just have the type of skin this gadget doesn&#x27;t help... but there is no indication that this is possible in their documentation.&lt;br /&gt;The advertising on the packaging promises a lot more than this delivers... there should be  a disclaimer that it doesn&#x27;t work on all people, if it even really works at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews unless the product was great or unless it was completely useless.  For me, this product did nothing.  Biore strips are better than this product.  Though it did leave a hickey on my boyfriends nose for about 3 days.  So, at least I got a laugh out of this product.  But, that was all I got.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotta say that so far I&#x27;ve been disappointed with this gizmo. It comes w/ a mounting rack which is ok if you you&#x27;ve got lots of accessible wall studs in your bathroom. It would have been nice if it had a sturdy weighted bottom so it could just sit on a bathroom shelf or counter without easily tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions come in about every modern language but about 95% of the instructions are safety related (don&#x27;t swim with it, don&#x27;t cook with it, don&#x27;t put it on your eyeball, etc.)... basically stuff to keep them from getting sued.&lt;br /&gt;I would have preferred tips on different types of skin, types of results to expect... how about including a video?&lt;br /&gt;The warnings also sited a danger of the suction being to strong if you drag it along your face, etc... maybe if you hook this thing up to a car battery, that would be the case... but the suction is not strong enough in my opinion to do anything. I was expecting this thing to help clean out blackheads... after all, it is a \\&quot;pore cleanser\\&quot; and it&#x27;s got a special attachment just for the nose... what else is on the nose other than blackheads? The manual says to not use it for pimples... and ladies, we all know that when we see this type of product, we&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;Hallelujah! A way to suck out these... blackheads!\\&quot; Well, think again.&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling that the prototype for this gizmo had a stronger suction, but they toned it down to keep from getting sued by morons who would try to use it.. to lance a boil or remove fat from the thighs.&lt;br /&gt;What a shame. I think a bunch of linked flexible soda straws would work just as well by sucking on one end and touching the other end to your nose....</li>
    <li> On my wife that device doesn&#x27;t seem to be working at all</li>
    <li> I tried several different ones and this one is by far the best.  You need to read the directions and keep you face damp like it says.  It cleans you pores, but you need to use regularly for awhile to see results.  Also it&#x27;s not an extractor, for that your better off getting a metal extractor (revlons it&#x27;s not too hot, but tweezerman makes a good one for about $10-$12)</li>
    <li> Like the others, I&#x27;ve been using Biore Pore strip. I needed a more economical solution and this is what I&#x27;ve found. For best results:&lt;br /&gt;1. You will need to make this part of your routine and with patience your skin can get clearer after repeated use. Honestly, after one use I can feel my skin get smoother as the surface dirt are sucked away.&lt;br /&gt;2. You will need to open up your pore before use. Apply a hot/warm face towel or water on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think this is a little more effective than a nose strip. However, the cons to using this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. Red marks will appear when left on one area for a time (especially true for those with sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;2. After use, you will need to follow the cleaning instructions of the product. Unlike nose strips where you just toss the product in the trash. However, you will get used to this procedure and it isn&#x27;t difficult to do. Panasonic has provided a cleaning tool, but I prefer to use cotton swabs and tissue as my cleaning aid.&lt;br /&gt;3. The motor is noisy.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is completely submersible so you can use this while in the shower. I like having a mirror while using the product (just like when shaving).&lt;br /&gt;There are people who are lucky not to be plagued with evident blackheads on the nose. If nose strips don&#x27;t work for you, this may produce similar lackluster results. However, to those who seem to need this product - have patience and you will see results.</li>
    <li> I received the pore cleanser in the mail today and I love it.  I have only been able to use it for a few minutes at a time-you have to charge it for 8 hours before use and I am not patient:)&lt;BR&gt;No matter, the few minutes that I have used it have been Amazing!  I have removed whiteheads from my chin that I have had for more than 15 years.  I have also removed blackheads from my nose that were impossible to remove in the past.&lt;BR&gt;Even if this is as good as it gets, I have seen results that I have not gotten from any other product.&lt;BR&gt;It is true that the first time that you use this tool, you will need to allocate at least an hour or more-depending upon how many black/whiteheads you have.  &lt;BR&gt;The only con that I can think of is that the charge time seems excessive but then again, I&#x27;m more than a little impatient. &lt;BR&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve takem 5 minutes to write this, so I have a little charge on the tool.  I&#x27;m back to facial cleansing!!!!</li>
    <li> I used it...and used it and used it....just like everyone said that I should do to give it a chance.  Well it was gathering dust in my bathroom and now it just missed the donation pile today.  The reason that it missed the donation pile was because I threw the box away and I didn&#x27;t want someone to wonder \\&quot;what in the heck is this thing...and what did that lady do with it??\\&quot;  So it will continue to gather dust....tucked away in my drawer.  DON\\&quot;T BUY IT.  Get some apricot scrub instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the reviews and with expectation that it&#x27;ll work by using it with patience, but it didn&#x27;t work at all.  I use it for 3 weeks on a regular basis and now it&#x27;s stored in my basement.  Don&#x27;t bother to try it.  It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This unit is supposed to remove oil and possibly blackheads and quite frankly removes nothing. I never even saw marks on my face at all, no matter how high the suction or how long I leave it in one place. I tried it on my preteen son who has multiple, very superficial blackheads and nothing at all was produced. Save your money.</li>
    <li> You just need to warm and wash your face first in the shower and use it in the shower.  This has done miracles for the (formerly) large pores on my nose that were just regular pores irritated by dirt/gunk that wouldn&#x27;t come out with any soap or Biore strip (which was quite irritating and inconsistent.)  Full results require use for about 3 weeks every 3 days!  It is also more effective if you lightly resoap and rinse after use.&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST [money]I EVER SPENT!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I ordered this product with some trepidation.  In fact, I probably would have been disuaded by several of the reviews for this product, had I not been so desperate.  You see--I have a nose that looks like a relief map of Jupiter.  I have pores on my nose that could swallow a VW bug--rivalling even the pot holes here in DC.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I fired this thing up for the first time--man was I pleasantly surprised!!!  I had to grab on to the towel rack to prevent being sucked into the black hole that this thing opened up in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if those with negative reviews mistakenly received the Fisher Price \\&quot;My First Zit Zapper\\&quot; or what, but this thing has some serious pop.  I have no doubt this product could suck-start a Harley--pity the attachments aren&#x27;t bigger ;-)</li>
    <li> I wouldnt say it is a miracle product but it is really good. The machine is simple to use and clean. you can clean the cap by q-tips even. It can cause purple spots after using but it goes away quickly. I would say to use it like before you go to bed not before going out, your nose or face can be red for awhile. It does suck out black spots and oil and you can see it doing it. not all of it at once it takes patience for your face and skin to adjust. Warm water and scrubs help before you use it. It is just better than squeezing it out and or using stripes. It is painless and effective. I would suggest that you use it if you dont have extreme dry skin. Again dont expect miracles.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for removing white heads/black heads.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely oily skin and the problems that go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To maximize benefit of this product :&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face with a soapy cleanser of choice.  This softens up all the dead skin and clogs in pores.  If you need further softening up, rinse in warm water for a couple more minutes or hold a thick wash cloth soaked in warm water against your skin about 5 minutes letting the moist heat open your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concentrate on small areas like cheeks on day 1, nose and chin on day 2, forehead on day 3. Make sure your face is wet/moist with the warm water before you begin (not too wet).  Start using the pore cleanser (best for me is the littlest suction cup, I don&#x27;t use the big cup side). Do not rewet, just repeat over the areas that you just did.  The pore cleaner will suck out all the softened impurities.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been using the Pore Cleanser for about 2 months and we have both realized an incredible reduction in blackheads as well as break-outs. The manufacturer&#x27;s claim that you will see an 80% reduction with these skin problems is absolutely true. We have both tried everything on the market, including an array of dermatologists&#x27; perscriptions. After spending much time and $$$ we thought  we were beyound help. We would highly recommend this product. (Be patient. It takes some time to see results-but you will!)</li>
    <li> I bought this at another store, and now I wish I had seen it here to have saved a lot of $$.  Anyway, this pore cleanser really does work.  I agree with those reviews who say it takes time to see the difference in your complexion.  But, the very first time I used it, I could see LOTS of dirt, oil and maybe even a few blackhead collected on the nose suction tip.  I use it mainly on my nose, and some on my forehead.  These are my oiliest areas.  This is not a magic wand.  If you have a terrible complexion, this will not magically fix it for you.  It will, however, clean the oil that causes blackheads from your pores.</li>
    <li> I think this pore cleanser has really improved my complexion. I use it almost every morning after the shower and am always amazed at the gunk that is pulled out each time! It&#x27;s satisfying in a slightly gross way, but I like seeing results!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews from multiple sites about this so-called pore cleanser.  Thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I should&#x27;ve listened to the bad reviews. Not that many people can be wrong about something not working.  It&#x27;s a piece of crap!  If you&#x27;re looking to get little circular bruises on your face,...this is the product for you.  And, unless your pores are oozing like a water faucet, you won&#x27;t get any results.  Lucky me, I happened to place the order twice, so I&#x27;ve got 2 of these awful things!</li>
    <li> Okay... I read all the reviews before purchasing this item ~1.5 months ago.  I tried using it on many occasions.  It is easy to use.  It did not leave bruises on my skin.  But it also didn&#x27;t suck much oil out of my pores either.  And you want to know why?  Because I&#x27;m already using micro-abrasive facial cleansers as well as exfoliation-enhancing salicyclic acid treatments.  So maybe this product works for those who do not already spend a lot of time and effort deep-cleaning their face.  But for people already following a rigorous cleansing protocol, this product does not do a thing.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks!!!!! It did nothing for me, I did what the instructions told me to do. I even steamed my face and it still didnt suck anything up no matter how long i left it on.</li>
    <li> I bought this item with high hopes but it is pretty much useless.  My teenage daughter wasn&#x27;t happy with it either.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really get any great results with this product. In fact, it was a little bit too powerful for my skin. The suction is very powerful and will leave marks on your face if you are not careful. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this product and feel it is well worth the $.  Your skin feels really good after using it as well.  I wrote a review on the Panasonic portable water pik which is also excellent and can be used to clean this unit easily.  I found this easy to clean even without the water pik and don&#x27;t know why they include the cleaning brush with it.</li>
    <li> this was not helpful for me or my bf.&lt;br /&gt;I just noticed that negative reviews on this item are rated as unhelpful by most: please do not delude yourself. This product does not work for people with moderate acne, at all. A scrub or any cream suppressing the developement of acne would do much better. Unless u want to use this product for non-prescribed purposes</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money.  Its just more propaganda for beauty products that dont work.  The suction is pretty strong and over time it can actually damage your skin and capillaries.  It seems to work ok around the nose area but is worthless on the forehead and cheeks.  I just ended up giving it to a friend of mine after about four uses.  Go buy the apricot scrub facial clensor, seems to work a lot better.</li>
    <li> I bought this product expecting it to work okay, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything spectacular.  It met my expectations, that&#x27;s about it.  For me, it only works on my nose and it only works if I steam my face before hand.  It does suck up a lot of gunk (from my nose), though.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad I purchased the product.  I&#x27;m 25 now, and I think that it would have worked wonders for me 10 years ago.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like this product would work for the vast majority of people, which is supported by the fact that most of the reviews seem to be negative.  If you had pretty bad skin and can sometimes squeeze gunk straight out of your open pores, then this device will suck it up.  For people who have pretty healthy skin who get the occasional blemish, expect nothing from this product.  Also, if you leave the suction on too long then you may get red spots on your face.  It&#x27;s logical to assume that if you bruise easy this product may not be for you.  I don&#x27;t bruise easily at all, and I have left one or two red spots on my faces from over-sucking.&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to be built pretty sturdy and the recharger is convient.  The mist option shoots out a cool refreshing mist, big deal....&lt;br /&gt;Oh yea, (as recommended) make sure you steam your face or shower before trying/using this product.</li>
    <li> The product somehow works, but you have to have an incredible patience to do anything. Since it takes so long to use, I barely have used it over the last year that I have purchased it. Also, I just found out yesterday that the thing does not want to work any more. How convenient, after the warranty is expired, the thing stops working, even though I was using it properly and only occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Reading the other reviews, I think this device depends a LOT on your skin type.  I have large pores on my nose which collect dirt and oil.  The rest of my face is somewhat dry.  I began by using an orange peel mask, then steamed by face with a hot washcloth.  Then I used the nose attachment.  It obviously sucked out the dirt from the pores in my nose -- you could SEE it collected inside the nose cup.  The face cup did very little, but I don&#x27;t have large pores on my face.  Perhaps over time, I will see some \\&quot;toning\\&quot; of the skin on my face.  But I really purchased it to take care of my oily nose -- so I&#x27;m pleased and think it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this product to be very helpful on my face. My skin feels tighter and firmer now. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;You may be wondering why so many people gave the product one star and wrote negative reviews. The reason is simple: they were too *LAZY* to read the instruction manual before using it. The manual is six short pages with detailed sketches and numbered step-by-step instructions that are simple enough for a 10-year-old to understand. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a product like this on my face before and I didn&#x27;t have a single problem with welts or bruising. It&#x27;s very easy to use. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Have you ever installed software on your computer that comes with an attached file titled READ ME FIRST? Typically, the people who complain that the software doesn&#x27;t work properly are the ones who were too lazy to open this &#x27;read me&#x27; file and see what it had to say. It usually includes a few sentences about how to configure somthing simple to get the most use out of the product. I think that&#x27;s the case here. They just didn&#x27;t bother to do that so they got angry at the product because they had to walk around in public looking like buffoons with welted skin. I&#x27;m still laughing at them and their reviews because they got what they deserved. Maybe next time they&#x27;ll read the instructions. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The product makes about as much noise as my electric razor so it&#x27;s quiet enough to use without waking anybody. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the nose piece. It&#x27;s a bit too big. I also wish the charger was designed for portability. Because of these reasons I gave this four stars.</li>
    <li> My skin is moderately oily but sensitive. Skin pore size was medium. Previously little acne but visible pores/blackheads up close. Previously washed face twice a day with Neutrogena Oil-Free Cream Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Biore strips worked well at removing blackheads, but always left my skin irritated. The surface of my skin felt tighter than the flesh below it. Felt like my skin was like foil, it got wrinkled over large areas if I touched the areas involved.&lt;br /&gt;This product works, but does not produce large results immediately. Followed device usage with Neutrogena cream cleaner. Washed twice a day with Neutrogena cream cleanser. Used the device for about 3-5 minutes after taking a shower for a period of 2 weeks. &lt;br /&gt;Keep the suction tip moving and move in opposing directions. Don&#x27;t stay in any area too long to avoid bruises. The underside of my forearms are as sensitive as my face. I practised on underside of my forearms before using the device on my face. Short strokes worked better than longer strokes. Tip of nose was difficult to apply suction to. A plucking motion worked well for the tip of the nose, but only a few plucks each session. My skin is sensitive, so after showering the areas i worked on were visibly pink for 5-10 minutes. I have had no bruises or marks (on my face) that lasted longer than 10 minutes during this 2 week period. Several bruises on my forearms, because I was curious. Particularly satisfying when cleaning the device, since all the crud off my face was visible.&lt;br /&gt;Visible and marked decrease in size and number of visible pores and blackheads after 2 weeks. Results in last 2 weeks has exceeded the months of biore strip + Neutrogena routine. My brother is also using this product on my recommendation. He tells me his results are similar. &lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience, I recommend this product in conjuction with or replacement of Biore strips as part of a facial cleaning routine. I recommend face washing only twice a day, using a good facial cleanser with this product.</li>
    <li> Item was received on time, as advertised.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
    <li> Absolutely no visible results after three weeks of regular use. I never felt like I was clearing anything out of my pores. Fortunately, I was able to return it for a refund.</li>
    <li> This product seems like it might be OK for loosely clogged pores, but for deeper blackheads, or for large pores, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I have drier skin, so maybe that&#x27;s the problem, but we tried it on my boyfriend and absolutely nothing budged.  I have tried it about 6 times over the last two weeks, and the only time anything was ever extracted from my pores was right where my nose meets my cheek, and I was excited to see some gunk actually get sucked out.  However, the next day, that area was completely bruised and dark red with blood under the skin.  Another effort yielded two circular bruises - one on my nose and another on my chin.  So while I believe this might work for some people, I&#x27;m not sure it won&#x27;t damage your skin.  I&#x27;m unfortunately sending mine back since it causes bruising, which doesn&#x27;t seem appropriate for this type of appliance.</li>
    <li> I received a Panasonic Pore Cleanser for Christmas.  I think it works very well.  My face felt very clean.  They do warn not to use it too long in one spot - pay attention - I have a pretty big purple spot on my forehead because I left it in one spot too long.  I just started using it so I don&#x27;t know how it works long-term, but so far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Given the reviews, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect... but thought I would give it a try...&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to. The first two days, I really didn&#x27;t know what I was doing, and thought it didn&#x27;t work. My nose turned black and blue because I kept the suction in one spot for like 8 seconds. But I paid attention to some of the other reviews, and redesigned my technique of using it... I couldn&#x27;t be happier at this point!!&lt;br /&gt;1.  You really really have to use it while your face has been steamed (during a hot shower, or putting your face over some steaming water for like 30 seconds, and then use the pore cleaner... then steam again, then use it again... back and forth).&lt;br /&gt;2.  You really need to move it around constantly on your face. Just sitting in one spot with the suction on doesn&#x27;t do anything but turn your skin red, black or blue! You really have to gently move it along your skin, and as you do (with the hot steam saturating your pores) it collects SO MUCH gunk along the sides of the suction cup!!&lt;br /&gt;   Those two techniques are what really give me results. I was my skin with my normal deep pore cleanser, and then use this suction and sooo many dead skins and gunky oil comes off- it is amazing. But you really really  have to do it while your pores are steamy steamy hot and ready to get rid of what&#x27;s clogging them!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product after I&#x27;ve washed my face with a deep pore cleanser from the drug store, and it would appear my skin is really clean, until I use this product- sooo much gunk comes out. It&#x27;s really surprising.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck,&lt;BR&gt;Feeling fresher in Chicago</li>
    <li> My skin is moderately oily but sensitive. Skin pore size was medium. Previously little acne but visible pores/blackheads up close. Previously washed face twice a day with Neutrogena Oil-Free Cream Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Biore strips worked well at removing blackheads, but always left my skin irritated. The surface of my skin felt tighter than the flesh below it. Felt like my skin was like foil, it got wrinkled over large areas if I touched the areas involved.&lt;br /&gt;This product works, but does not produce large results immediately. Followed device usage with Neutrogena cream cleaner. Washed twice a day with Neutrogena cream cleanser.  Used the device for about 3-5 minutes after taking a shower for a period of 2 weeks. &lt;br /&gt;Keep the suction tip moving and move in opposing directions. Don&#x27;t stay in any area too long to avoid bruises. The bottom of my forearms are as sensitive as my face. I practised on bottom side of forearms before using the device on my face. Short strokes worked better than longer strokes. Tip of nose was difficult to apply suction to. A plucking motion worked well for the tip of the nose, but only a few plucks each session. My skin is sensitive so after showering, the areas i worked on were visibly pink for 5-10 minutes. I have had no bruises or marks that lasted longer than 10 minutes during this 2 week period. Particularly satisfying when cleaning the device, since all the crud off my face was visible.&lt;br /&gt;Visible decrease in size and number of visible pores and blackheads after 2 weeks. My brother is also using this product on my recommendation. He tells me his results are similar. &lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience, I recommend this product in conjuction or replacement of Biore strips as part of a facial cleaning routine. I recommend face washing only twice a day, using a good facial cleanser with this product.</li>
    <li> Makess noise and suck your skin into the nozzle, pore cleansing? Not so much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very effective in cleaning pores  and specially helpful in removing blackheads and whiteheads. If you are one of those who spend hours removing blackheads by those  traditional painful methods, try this.</li>
    <li> I was very upset when I bought this item - it simply was not effective. My sister-in-law, however, asked if she could borrow it. She experienced amazing results with it. I then asked her to show me how she was using it because we both figured that I must just be using it wrong. She was doing everything I had been doing - but I did not get any results. She offered to apply it to my problem areas (mostly the sides of my nose and my chin). She then started wrinkling her forhead and cursing. It wasn&#x27;t that I was doing it  wrong - it just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin type. I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, so I can&#x27;t tell you what differences there are... we are both white girls with greasy noses... but my sister-in-law has no blackheads and you could connect the dots with mine for a year.&lt;br /&gt;It turned out to be great for her - I gave her mine to keep - but I&#x27;m out my investment because the item did not work on my skin. There are no guarantees for money back, no descriptions of different skin types or even an acknowledgement that there are some skin-types this will not work on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some other reviews on here from other people who were also dissatisfied. I think if the suction were stronger... if there was a super-duper model or something, folks like me would have success... but a mosquito does a better suction job on my skin that this gadget.</li>
    <li> This piece of plastic with a little pump does little besides spray water on your skin and make little marks on your face. It does NOT remove whiteheads. It does NOT remove blackheads. It does WASTE your time. Save your money and use facial washes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles. You have to use it routinely, creatively, and patiently to see real results. Don&#x27;t put too much stock in what the directions say; be careful, but do what works for you. It&#x27;s decent. I don&#x27;t particularly regret buying it, but like I said before: Don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> Despite some varied reviews, I took a chance.  So happy I did. If you can (this part is graphic) regularly sqeeze gunk out of the pores on your nose, this cleanser is awesome, and a real time saver.  You get immediate results and pores get smaller as you use it over time, every two days or so.  It only works after or in a hot shower or bath, when your pores are open.  I use it in conjunction with Joey&#x27;s Pore Cleansing Gel, but never on the same day, of course. So, if you have healthy (relatively Acne free)skin, but are battling giant pores and blackheads - give this a shot.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time this morning as I am leaving for a vacation and thought it&#x27;ll  make me look good in my vacation. Guess what? It left all pink/purple marks in my face and I look like a clown now. I can&#x27;t pose for the photos in the vacation now. I am so upset. I didn&#x27;t use it for a long time at one spot. I think my skin is very sensitive. But for the money I paid I didn&#x27;t expect it. It ruined my vacation. I don&#x27;t know when these spots will go away.</li>
