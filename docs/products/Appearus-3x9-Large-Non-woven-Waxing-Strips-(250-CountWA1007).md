      <li>It was a good purchase</li>
      <li>A good buy.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t super impressed with this products ability to remove hair as effectively as some of the online reviews would have you believe.</li>
      <li>I love using these!</li>
      <li>Amazing price.</li>
      <li>Nice strips.</li>
      <li>There are no holes in these nonwoven strips for the warm wax to leach through to make the strip sticky to handle.  </li>
      <li>These nonwoven strips are thicker than fabric, smooth and adhere perfectly to the warm wax and strip it off cleanly.  </li>
      <li>High quality strips that work perfectly.  </li>
      <li>but I had no issue with them and the price is a lot better</li>
      <li>Wax away :)</li>
      <li>These are so much better than the cloth strips or Muslin strips as they don&#x27;t let the wax seep through and make your hands all sticky.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I use a lot of these strips, and this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>(To a better place, I&#x27;m sure.)</li>
      <li>Easy to use strips.</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>This time it was really easy to wax with these.</li>
      <li>Easy material to work with.</li>
      <li>Worked fine had no issues, they feel a bit thinner than the Gigi ones</li>
      <li>I bought these wax strips after looking at the options available on amazon.</li>
      <li>This product is used with Satin Smooth wax</li>
      <li>this was so easy and quick.</li>
      <li>Nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>I used the muslin strips which were good but after using non woven strips, i won&#x27;t go back to musling.</li>
      <li>I ordered the right ones.</li>
      <li>The wax seeps right through them.  </li>
      <li>I liked these nonwoven strips so much, I won&#x27;t be going back to muslin ones.  </li>
      <li>This could be because of the wax I was using, so I gave these 3 stars because I&#x27;m going to try them again with a different bikini wax to see if that has a better result.</li>
      <li>But, it works very well!  </li>
      <li>now my husband decided he wanted me to wax his back, which truth be told had more hair than on his head.</li>
      <li>use it with Cream wax and it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Ive been waxing for many years and never had such problems!!!</li>
      <li>Hot wax comes out of muslin cloth and makes hand sticky.</li>
      <li>These are so much more neat and tidy, and I can cut them down to a smaller size.</li>
      <li>Make sure the wax is not too hot, (if the wax is dripping, then it&#x27;s too hot) and just a thin layer of wax will work much better too.  </li>
      <li>Easy, clean and removes wax with less pain and no tearing.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Look around to find better pricing as this was not worth the money for the product we received.</li>
      <li>and she says they work better than the strips she was previously using that had the wax already on the strip.</li>
      <li>This came with free shipping when I bought some other items, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They also don&#x27;t fall apart in strings like the muslin strips which can cause a huge mess.</li>
      <li>I have observed that I can use it for fewer times than I could use some other strips I have had in the past, but for the price it does a good job.</li>
      <li>I purchased these strips for facial waxing, so the 3 x 9-inch size is too large for me.  </li>
      <li>Honee soft wax, which I use with these cloth strips.</li>
      <li>Compare to the original wax strips came with the wax, this product feel a little like fiber.  </li>
      <li>I don’t care too much for these because they feel more like paper rather than other waxing strips I have purchased in the past</li>

<li> just like they should at minimal cost</li>
<li> Not at all what I expected</li>

<li> and you wind up with a mess.</li>
<li> These have worked well for me and haven&#x27;t fallen apart or left lots of wax behind.  </li>
<li> These strips are too stiff and not flexible.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t seem to get it to work right :-(</li>
<li> Ive never used such bad strips in my life.</li>
<li> but they are somewhat thin</li>
<li> horrible, never have used this before.</li>

    <li> Good strips, wax came off well with these. The kit I bought did not have enough strips...</li>
    <li> Easy material to work with.</li>
    <li> Compare to the original wax strips came with the wax, this product feel a little like fiber.  But, it works very well!  Make sure the wax is not too hot, (if the wax is dripping, then it&#x27;s too hot) and just a thin layer of wax will work much better too.  I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I love using these! I&#x27;ve get these every time I need them, they work great.. and great price! Wax away :)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item works well.</li>
    <li> Worked fine had no issues, they feel a bit thinner than the Gigi ones but I had no issue with them and the price is a lot better</li>
    <li> These work well for waxing at home. The only downside is that they come in plastic wrap -- since I&#x27;m not a salon, I don&#x27;t have a wax-strip-size container to put them in. I settled for a ziplock bag!</li>
    <li> Its very Hard to use with Wax , the Strips should be little Smooth while doing wax. This Strip has lot of Strach in it.</li>
    <li> Perfect solution when you run out of the strips that come in the Sally Hansen waxing kits.  High quality strips that work perfectly.  Very pleased with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used muslin strips in the past for facial waxing, but I thought I&#x27;d give these nonwoven strips a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I liked these nonwoven strips so much, I won&#x27;t be going back to muslin ones.  These nonwoven strips are thicker than fabric, smooth and adhere perfectly to the warm wax and strip it off cleanly.  There are no holes in these nonwoven strips for the warm wax to leach through to make the strip sticky to handle.  I purchased these strips for facial waxing, so the 3 x 9-inch size is too large for me.  But I prefer the larger size because I can make the strip exactly the size I want for waxing small areas.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get it to work right :-(</li>
    <li> These have worked well for me and haven&#x27;t fallen apart or left lots of wax behind.  I am not a professional, but I use these for waxing my legs.  I bought the Gigi wax warmer and All-Purpose Honee soft wax, which I use with these cloth strips.</li>
    <li> I had used these long ago before I had my leg hair removed. (To a better place, I&#x27;m sure.) now my husband decided he wanted me to wax his back, which truth be told had more hair than on his head. I agreed and now he has the smoothest back around! I refuse to do his chest, however...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how people use the &amp;#34;muslin&amp;#34; fabric. The wax seeps right through them.  I ordered the right ones. Phew!</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Easy to use strips.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of these strips, and this one is my favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t separate or tear like some do and you wind up with a mess.</li>
    <li> Works perfect. Nice strips.</li>
    <li> A good buy.  Works just like they should at minimal cost</li>
    <li> Ive never used such bad strips in my life. my skin is hurting and bruised- and it still didnt take off the hair i wanted. Ive been waxing for many years and never had such problems!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter and she says they work better than the strips she was previously using that had the wax already on the strip. She also likes that fact that she can cut these to size depending on the area to be waxed.</li>
    <li> Non-woven waxing strips cloth epilating Wax Strips is a great product.  The quality is better than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> easy to use. reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I don’t care too much for these because they feel more like paper rather than other waxing strips I have purchased in the past and they don’t seem to grab all the wax.</li>
    <li> This product is used with Satin Smooth wax and I have been very happy with the results. It was a good purchase</li>
    <li> horrible, never have used this before. no instructions. instructions found online didnt work. dont buy!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think these are all that great. Oher sellers are selling them for cheaper. Look around to find better pricing as this was not worth the money for the product we received.</li>
    <li> Good but they are somewhat thin sometimes u can feel the wax passing through</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected</li>
    <li> I recently started waxing at home with Gigi wax. I used the muslin strips which were good but after using non woven strips, i won&#x27;t go back to musling. this was so easy and quick. Hot wax comes out of muslin cloth and makes hand sticky. This time it was really easy to wax with these.</li>
    <li> Works great. Amazing price. Just as I expected</li>
    <li> These strips are too stiff and not flexible. I scarred my body using them.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft.  Wonderful quality.  Can use one strip multiple times with wax.</li>
    <li> Easy, clean and removes wax with less pain and no tearing.</li>
    <li> I bought these wax strips after looking at the options available on amazon. This came with free shipping when I bought some other items, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with Cream wax and it works pretty well.
