      <li>The light makes it super easy to us.</li>
      <li>The best small trimmer on the market.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t give you the clean trim and the battery</li>

      <li>I really like this trimmer.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care to much for that one either</li>
      <li>But for me it very helpful.</li>
      <li>the fact that it is unique was instant conversation.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;The one I had previously was better</li>
      <li>Okay to start with didn&#x27;t last long, six months tops, the blades dulled and it wouldn&#x27;t cut.</li>
      <li>The clippers were $5 to $10 over what I&#x27;d pay for a normal run of the mill set of consumer clippers.</li>
      <li>So you can cover pretty much the entire world on this trimmer.</li>
      <li>The light is extremely helpful when I&#x27;m trimming my sideburns.</li>
      <li>In fact, the woman that cuts my hair uses this exact same clippers, so I know that they will stand the test of time.</li>
      <li>It really surprised him and</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;guards\\&quot; on the trimmer are too far apart</li>
      <li>They shine right thru thin, light colored hair.  </li>
      <li>If you have dark thick hair - probably a good thing.  </li>
      <li>Now holds charge for several trims and charges back up fast.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t pay much attention to the person that wrote that the clippers are not what she expected.</li>
      <li>The light is unreliable and only works when it wants to, and the attachments are worthless unless you enjoy having your hairs ripped out of your skin.</li>

<li> it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> $ more expensive than other cheaper trimmers.</li>
<li> So to me that puts this trimmer in the same bin as the other cheap ones, but at least it feels heavy.</li>
<li> I expect to have this trimmer for a long time.</li>

<li> The last one I had lasted for a few years.</li>
<li> This trimmer works as well as any other cheapie.</li>
<li> He can shave in the dark with one hand and no longer has to balance holding a flashlight.</li>
<li> However, there are a few problems.</li>
<li> I bring one home and charge everyday, I don&#x27;t even have a cord at my station.</li>
<li> In the past I&#x27;ve had to hold them in place as I trim.</li>
<li> Gives u a small brush for cleaning after u r done and also a oil bottle to keep your trimmer lubricated.    </li>
<li> These trimmers are not at all what I expected, The light that is on the trimmers cause a reflection on the skin and make it very difficult to see what you are trimming from the neckline , I am a profressional hairstylist and these are the worst tool I have used.</li>
<li> Some salons have different and bad lighting over each  chair</li>
<li> it has no a good power</li>
<li> but it has a very weak battery.  </li>
<li> It has a lot of attachments - 3 day, 5 day, 7 day for trimming and others for hair cutting purposes.</li>
<li> Also they are not on a rechargeable base they connect to a cord that you pull off and this to me is a weird way to recharge the battery  </li>
<li> ,  this must be a bad lot.</li>
<li> If you do it will pull the hair on your face and it&#x27;s very painful.  </li>
<li> Thought the lights would be a plus, instead they are awful.  </li>

    <li> I bought this trimmer basically to get a stubbled look.I knew that Andis is a good manufacturer of trimmers and clippers and so I took this chance. I must say that this trimmer is really worth the price. I got it for about $[...] inclusive of shipping.    It has a pair of illuminating white LEDs which light up the area u r trimming.Personally i didnt require this but since it s comes with it, it s fine.    It has a lot of attachments - 3 day, 5 day, 7 day for trimming and others for hair cutting purposes. Gives u a small brush for cleaning after u r done and also a oil bottle to keep your trimmer lubricated.    The best part of the deal is that this trimmer comes with a dual voltage charger - 240V and 110V. So you can cover pretty much the entire world on this trimmer.That was necessary for me and hell yeah, it served my purpose!!You can read abt this trimmer and its accessories at [...].     I would recommend this trimmer for anyone who needs a basic, polished trim by self-help for day-to-day usage.Of course, you can go to the salon if u really need to stand out in a crowd though!!    A good trimmer this one...For the price, u get a branded product which is just about [...]$ more expensive than other cheaper trimmers.</li>
    <li> The quality of the trimmer seemed great and I loved the light but had to return it.  The \\&quot;guards\\&quot; on the trimmer are too far apart and consequently you can&#x27;t apply any pressure to your face when trimming.  If you do it will pull the hair on your face and it&#x27;s very painful.  I returned this item.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> This feels very solid in my hand as opposed to every other mustache trimmer that I&#x27;ve owned. I love the way the trimmer guard clicks into place. In the past I&#x27;ve had to hold them in place as I trim. I expect to have this trimmer for a long time.</li>
    <li> I sent this straight to my fiancé overseas. He got it quickly and loves it. He can shave in the dark with one hand and no longer has to balance holding a flashlight. It really surprised him and the fact that it is unique was instant conversation.</li>
    <li> I have 4 of them the greatest invention ever. Some salons have different and bad lighting over each  chair this fixes the problem, the shadowing from over head lights goes away, you can see the details you need to see with the lighted timmer. Thank you again Mr. Andis</li>
    <li> Good product professional quality, did not fully charge the first time I charged it overnight took about 24 hours the first time. Now holds charge for several trims and charges back up fast.</li>
    <li> These trimmers are not at all what I expected, The light that is on the trimmers cause a reflection on the skin and make it very difficult to see what you are trimming from the neckline , I am a profressional hairstylist and these are the worst tool I have used. Also they are not on a rechargeable base they connect to a cord that you pull off and this to me is a weird way to recharge the battery  Do yourself a favor and keep looking</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best clipper trimmer I&#x27;m a hairdresser and it is all I use . You can see every hair</li>
    <li> Works great . The light is a added bonus. The best small trimmer on the market. The last one I had lasted for a few years.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t pay much attention to the person that wrote that the clippers are not what she expected. She&#x27;s a stylist using the clippers on others. Me, I&#x27;m a guy using the clippers on myself. The light is extremely helpful when I&#x27;m trimming my sideburns. The light shows those stray hairs that have gotten unruly and need to be cut.     The clippers were $5 to $10 over what I&#x27;d pay for a normal run of the mill set of consumer clippers. The $5 to $10 made all the difference in the quality of the clipper. This is much more of a professional set. In fact, the woman that cuts my hair uses this exact same clippers, so I know that they will stand the test of time. She likes them and they work well for her.  Now I can say the same.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge.  I charged it for hours but it has a very weak battery.  &amp;#34;The one I had previously was better,  this must be a bad lot.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer in my salon for quite a while. I thought the light would be helpful, but for me it is almost too bright. I wish it had an option to turn the light on or off. The blades work great. It is comfortable to hold and I can&#x27;t do without the T-blade when trimming around ears. It charges quickly and holds the charge well.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works as well as any other cheapie. It has good battery life, good weight and feel, and I use it to trim my beard because I&#x27;m usually too lazy to shave unless I have to. However, there are a few problems. The light is unreliable and only works when it wants to, and the attachments are worthless unless you enjoy having your hairs ripped out of your skin. So to me that puts this trimmer in the same bin as the other cheap ones, but at least it feels heavy.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer. The light makes it super easy to us. I haven&#x27;t nicked myself at all. The only issue is that it came with 2 5-day combs, and no 7-day comb. That is the one that would be best for my sideburns.  Anyway, I like it.</li>
    <li> Okay to start with didn&#x27;t last long, six months tops, the blades dulled and it wouldn&#x27;t cut.</li>
    <li> Thought the lights would be a plus, instead they are awful.  They shine right thru thin, light colored hair.  If you have dark thick hair - probably a good thing.  But if not, worse than having no light.</li>
    <li> To tell you the truth I don&#x27;t like the light. This trimmer is ok it works just like the old one I had. I didn&#x27;t care to much for that one either but they do there job.</li>
    <li> Some people said the trimmer with the light will distract them. But for me it very helpful. The battery will last about 12 liens. I got two of them. I bring one home and charge everyday, I don&#x27;t even have a cord at my station. I use all cordless equipment so nice.</li>
    <li> Not for professionals</li>
    <li> I have used Andis  trimmer with the a cord for more than 18 years it always worked good, But this one not so good it has no a good power and it doesn&#x27;t give you the clean trim and the battery it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
