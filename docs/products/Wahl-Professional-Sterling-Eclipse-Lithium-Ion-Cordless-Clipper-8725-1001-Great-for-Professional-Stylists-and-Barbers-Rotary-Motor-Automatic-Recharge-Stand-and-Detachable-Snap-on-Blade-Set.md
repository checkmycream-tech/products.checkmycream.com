      <li>Great clipper...</li>
      <li>I am happy.  </li>

      <li>I had to buy the fine blade which works great.  </li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it offered 1/16\\&quot; and 3/16\\&quot; guide combs, which allows for refined trimming to compensate for the unit lacking a fade control thumb lever.  </li>

      <li>it is best for the economy as a whole.  </li>

      <li>So far this clipper has proved to be an excellent performer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re signaling incoming aircraft, but not so great for a bathroom where you might actually want to sleep without being blinded.</li>

      <li>it is very light weight and cordless.</li>

      <li>Love these</li>
      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>The batter life on all prior was horrid at best, and I could maybe get a 5-10 minute clipper job done.  </li>
      <li>so no doubt you will be able to find a length to your liking.  </li>
      <li>Love the lithium ion battery.</li>
      <li>Being her \\&quot;favorite Nana\\&quot;, I wanted to help her out by purchasing clippers for her.  </li>
      <li>I love that they are cordless which helps to cut quicker and easier around the head.  </li>
      <li>These clippers cut better than any clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
      <li>was never dropped nothing has ever happened to the clipper for it to stop working and not even be able to take the battery hold.</li>
      <li>Hope the clippers are better than the shipping.</li>
      <li>My wife (and barber) likes it much better than the clipper it replaced.</li>
      <li>She chose these and was extremely pleased with the quality.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to keep it lubed up.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I was able to fade my husbands hair with ease and give him a pretty good line up.</li>
      <li>I had no problems at first and was pleased with how lightweight they are and loved the fact that they were cordless.</li>
      <li>things are light and very easy to maneuver.  </li>
      <li>before that it was pretty good...</li>
      <li>-cut)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to replace blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Got them for a GREAT price (better than at any supply store) and I will definately purchase my next pair from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Easy on the wrist, flicks hair off easily.</li>
      <li>This thing is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>Strong and durable.  </li>
      <li>The motor is strong to cut through my hair when it is longer.  </li>
      <li>very pleased, thanks.</li>
      <li>I still wish they supplied it with a fine blade or made a balding blade</li>
      <li>These clippers WERE just fine...</li>
      <li>I am not upping the rating because I had to by the fine blade</li>
      <li>So I emailed Wahl with my story and they sent a replacement fine blade for free.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend to someone that cuts their own hair and beard and wants to be wire free.</li>
      <li>The attachment combs are a bit on the cheap side, but that isn&#x27;t what I bought them for.  </li>
      <li>There were trimmers that would be great for beard trimming and such, but no clippers.  </li>
      <li>Have had the third unit for a couple if years and works great.</li>
      <li>I am cheap by nature, I didnt see the need to get a pro wahl clipper.  </li>
      <li>Usually cheap ones from department stores</li>
      <li>After 6 months of light use it went south on me.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>I had started researching all of the new cordless clippers, which are very few surprisingly, because I wanted to find ones that used a lithium ion battery as those are the best at holding a charge and will keep that charge even after weeks of non-use.  </li>
      <li>Has not been used enough to fully assess, but appears to be a very nice clipper.</li>
      <li>It was my first time placing an order and it went very smooth.</li>
      <li>It is super quiet which is great.</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller and couldn&#x27;t exchange them because I didn&#x27;t have the originally packaging.</li>
      <li>I received the original box that the clippers came in with a USPS sticker on it.  </li>
      <li>It works well and does a good job of clipping, but you must leave it plugged in constantly if you want it to be available, as the battery discharges if you unplug</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned several clippers and these are by far the best.</li>
      <li>They are very light and very dependable.  </li>
      <li>There Specialty are invaluable in texturizing and special effects</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re Smooth, accurate and, fast!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Battery died and wil not recharge after 5 months.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers for my granddaughter who is a professional hair dresser.  She recently started a new job and had to provide her own clippers.  Being her \\&quot;favorite Nana\\&quot;, I wanted to help her out by purchasing clippers for her.  She chose these and was extremely pleased with the quality.  We compared prices and felt that we got a super deal on these clippers.</li>
    <li> Since I have been wearing buzzcuts for decades I&#x27;ve owned several clippers.  Usually cheap ones from department stores but my last set was a more expensive Wahl model I got from Sally Beauty that I expected to last longer but after a drop they were never the same.  My wife requested that the replacement clippers be cordless.  Some research lead me to Wahl Sterling Eclipse clippers.  These have been great!  They cut evenly with only a few passes unlike other clippers I&#x27;ve owned that require you to go over and over and over to get an even cut.  For some reason the Sterling Eclipse clippers cut shorter with the #1 guard than my old clippers did with that guard even though my old clippers were also Wahl.  This kit comes with #1/2 and #1-1/2 guards so no doubt you will be able to find a length to your liking.  These clippers cut better than any clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned plus they are cordless and much quieter.  They aren&#x27;t cheap but quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten.</li>
    <li> As described.  Arrive promptly.  Still working 2 years later (or more).  A bit noisy, but always was.  Head does get warm.  Be sure to keep it lubed up.</li>
    <li> Best cordless clipper I&#x27;ve owned in 35 years...I dare you to find a better clipper at this price! Tired of having to replace corded clippers routinely, I shopped for a cordless clipper on the internet for weeks, and the only models available were 2-3 times the cost of this one. I use them in my salon almost every day. They are light, comfortable in my small hand, and powerful: no snagging when plowing through super thick hair. Love the lithium ion battery. Note: The attachments are slightly smaller than standard Wahl guides. Without an attachment, they cut closer than my trimmers. However, I don&#x27;t use them for skin contact anymore...They are so sharp I actually nicked a client using them around his ear!&lt;br /&gt;So far, after using them for about 2 months in my salon, I would highly recommend this clipper to other professinal barbers and stylists. I&#x27;ll submit another review after I&#x27;ve used them for a year and report on their durability.</li>
    <li> After a few purchases of Andis professional cordless clippers that cut poorly, overheated and/or had terrible battery life or power levels, I was reticent about this one.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised by this unit.  Assuming one understands the motor doesn&#x27;t have the power level of a corded unit, this does a good job trimming my hair on a weekly basis and allowed for 4 trims before needing recharging.  I liked the fact that it offered 1/16\\&quot; and 3/16\\&quot; guide combs, which allows for refined trimming to compensate for the unit lacking a fade control thumb lever.  One great thing about this is that this clipper doesn&#x27;t heat up with use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Wahl clippers (15 - 20 years).  Personally, I have found them to be the most reliable for cutting my hair with the least pull and the blades tend to outlast the clippers themselves.  I use them once every 2 - 3 weeks.  I have found with this usage, a set of clippers will generally last me about 2 - 2 1/2 years.  I am very disappointed that these only last about 16 months.  They were working great the last time I cut my hair, but today when I went to use them they were just dead and will no longer take a charge.  Normally with cordless clippers, they tend to fade out providing some warning they are nearing the end of their lifespan.  This was not the case.  Short of how they just suddenly died on me, the clippers were great.  I won&#x27;t be buying this model again but I will stick with Wahl.  I can&#x27;t recommend these to anybody else without telling to plan on buying another set in about 12 months.</li>
    <li> Strong clipper, harder to clean, blades very sharp.</li>
    <li> Buzzer was ok during the few times i used it. The clips did not fit so well. After a few times of use, the buzzer would not charge. Then i realized it would try to charge if the buzzer is switched to the on state.  Totally junk. Waste of $80.</li>
    <li> I have used a corded clipper for years so this cordless one is a delight!  It does a much better job than my old clipper too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 or 4 different sets of cordless clippers over the past 5 years or so.  These are hands down the winner and will probably still be using them 5 years from now.  One of the biggest problems I have had with my previous clippers is that the battery would stop holding a charge.  The clippers that faired the worst in that area were the Wahl Self Cut clippers where the head pivoted.  Great idea but the battery in those lasted less than 6 months.  These, although they look pretty plain, are very solid and feel very good in the hand while cutting.  The attachment combs are a bit on the cheap side, but that isn&#x27;t what I bought them for.  I wanted a pair that would actually last for a while since I&#x27;m on a very limited budget, as are many nowadays.  I had started researching all of the new cordless clippers, which are very few surprisingly, because I wanted to find ones that used a lithium ion battery as those are the best at holding a charge and will keep that charge even after weeks of non-use.  Up until recently, I couldn&#x27;t find any that had this type of battery.  There were trimmers that would be great for beard trimming and such, but no clippers.  When I found these being sold by Cache Beauty and the fact that they are actually made in the USA, I had no problem shelling out the $70.00 for these.  That is another thing that I have had a problem with lately and that is finding things actually made in the U.S.  Since I am on a limited budget, I have made a rule that anything that I need to purchase that is more than $50.00 must be made in the U.S.  I don&#x27;t care if I have to pay a little more for the product because I know in the long run it is best for the economy as a whole.  So, if you were waiting for a review on this item because you were uncertain as to how these performed, I can tell you for a set of cordless clippers less than $100.00 these are A++.</li>
    <li> These clippers are awesome.  They are very light and very dependable.  I love that they are cordless which helps to cut quicker and easier around the head.  Got them for a GREAT price (better than at any supply store) and I will definately purchase my next pair from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works very well but Be sure not to leave The trimmer on the charger base when the base is unplugged from the wall, this appears to kill the battery. found this out after getting two replacements in first couple of months. Have had the third unit for a couple if years and works great.</li>
    <li> I have really short hair and keep it closely shaved; so when I use the clippers it&#x27;s for no longer than 10-15 min every couple weeks. I was able to use these clippers about 10 times total before they completely stopped working. The unit stopped working so I placed it on the charger; came back a while later and still dead. These are JUNK..Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this clipper in the past and loved it.  I decided to buy the same one.  I received it and put it on the charger for the recommended 12 hours.  when I took it to work to use it, it barely made it through one mens haircut.  I got on amazon today to return it and it says I missed the window by one day.  I am very disappointed!  So much for trying to save money by ordering on amazon rather than the beauty supply.  I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> I got this for general hair cutting and trimming at home. I cut my own hair, and wanted something lightweight and portable that holds a long enough charge for a full haircut. This easily holds enough charge to do several full hair cuts. The light weight and small size (diameter) make it easy to hold especially when I&#x27;m cutting my own hair, because sometimes I have to hold it with two or three fingers when I&#x27;m trimming the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges fast enough - I don&#x27;t need a speed charger - my hair doesn&#x27;t grow that fast!  It also hold that charge for a long time since it uses Lithium cells, unlike my old Ni-Cad powered clipper... charge it once, and it&#x27;s ready to go when I need it.  It stays cool when used for an extended time - my other one would get uncomfortably warm.  The blades are sharp and cut great.  I&#x27;ve had this clipper for almost 2 years, and it works as well as it did when I first bought it.  I&#x27;m expecting the battery to die pretty soon, since Li batteries last about this long, but it&#x27;s also nice to know that the battery is replaceable.</li>
    <li> The power is great and after lining it up, it cuts like a dream. I have owned it for very little time and use it once a week for a couple of minutes. I spray lube pre and post use, and take good care of my barbering equipment. The battery stopped working after only 6 months of occasional use! The cutting blade rusted despite my best efforts in just over a year. It was not terribly expensive to purchase replacements for those parts but should I really have to?</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed . I am a professional Barber and use earlier version for decades. There Specialty are invaluable in texturizing and special effects</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve owned! I love that they are cordless!</li>
    <li> was a little different from first one,  but they are a good clipper.  My daughter cuts hair for a living, so needs a dependable clipper.  Wahls are very good brand.</li>
    <li> Pretty freaking good for cordless!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper back in January. Right after the 30 day return Mark the clipper broke and would not work anymore I got online because I thought it was maybe a battery problem I purchased a battery from a battery online store place it into the clicker and the blue light came on I thought hooray it&#x27;s going to work. About 24 hours later I came back to the blue light flashing nonstop once I took the clipper off the charger I turned it on and all he did was move back-and-forth a couple times very slowly and then died again. I realized at that point that the clipper was broken and could not be fixed the clipper was never dropped nothing has ever happened to the clipper for it to stop working and not even be able to take the battery hold. I never write reviews on products but I was very disappointed that it is only work for 30 days and now it&#x27;s broken forever. But after reading much of the most commonly asked questions was where do I get a battery for this clipper I realize that I wasn&#x27;t the only one who had this problem I think this is a junk product that they are selling. Possibly these clippers have been used repeatedly and then towards the end of their lifespan they sell them. I would not buy another clipper from the seller!</li>
    <li> Worked well, while it worked. After 6 months of light use it went south on me. Got a new battery, that didnt help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several clippers and these are by far the best. I shave my whole head and face at least once a week. Cordless and the battery lasts a long time. Quiet motor. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Lithium battery lasts for several haircuts, doesn&#x27;t stall when cutting hair, not narrow like earlier model, plenty of attachable comb fittings for any length hair, oil in it comes in tiny bottle that leaks over time but you can buy larger container of oil separately for the long run.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> A nice, compact hair clipper ideal for occasional trimming/hair cutting.  Has a nice assortment of attachments for varying lengts of hair.  Has not been used enough to fully assess, but appears to be a very nice clipper.</li>
    <li> These clippers WERE just fine...for a little while.  It didn&#x27;t take long &amp; the clippers seemed to have no power or clipper speed.  They act like the battery is dying, but even after charging them (the blue light goes out &amp; they are supposedly fully charged), the clipper speed is slow &amp; after 2 attempts to cut, the blades stop altogether.  I bought new blades thinking that the blades were dull &amp; the friction was too much for the clipper motor.  New blades didn&#x27;t help.  In conclusion, I don&#x27;t know whether the battery is not able to charge any more or the clipper motor is just weak, but clippers should last longer than 5 months...especially seeing as how often they get used!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product because is lightweight and cordless. However, for me it was dificult to open it.</li>
    <li> I bought these after trying to cut my sons heair with an older set of wahl clippers.  They were reccomended by a friend who is in the business of cutting hair.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.  Price is right and cutting quality is amazing.  The only comment I have is that when you turn them on if you are not holding them firmly in your hand the bussing noise is a little louder than was expecting but once gripped for cutting this is a non-issue.  Not enough to detract from a five star rating.</li>
    <li> i bought this product just used 3 times ,it stop working, i called  the seller ,they&#x27;re answer  sorry you had passed 90 days&lt;br /&gt; i am really disappoint about this clipper wasted 80$ and time</li>
    <li> very pleased, thanks.</li>
    <li> I have had these for about 2yrs now.  I really love them. Battary life is excellent. Powereful. Clients mention how quiet they are. However once they get some age to them they do get a bit louder. I gave them 4 stars because there is no adjustable blade.</li>
    <li> I loved this at first but with less than a year of use the charger died..I had to buy a new...it&#x27;s not worth the cost. From here on out I will spend a little more for longevity!--amber, los angeles, hairstylist.</li>
    <li> The worst ever shipping .  I received the original box that the clippers came in with a USPS sticker on it.  Most people with common sense put the product in a box to protect the product. The box was opened and tore and anyone could have opened took the razor out and put it back.  Hope the clippers are better than the shipping.</li>
    <li> Strong and durable.  Will cut the thickest hair with ease.  Quick delivery and reliable.  I recommend the Wahl 8-Pack Color Coded Cutting Guides with Organizer to go with this remarkably good clipper.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and used these clippers to cut around 20-25 clients/week. I had no problems at first and was pleased with how lightweight they are and loved the fact that they were cordless. However, these clippers, quite literally, just quit working out of nowhere. The battery would no longer hold a charge until it quit charging/turning on all together. Coincidentally this happened just days after the 1-yr manufacturers warranty expired. Being that I took good care of my clippers and they had never been dropped or banged up in any way, leads me to believe that these are not made to last beyond a certain time. On one hand, you could argue that I got an entire year of use from these clippers and that should be sufficient, but I paid $90 for this clipper and I would have been happier if it had lasted more like 3 years. If you are a stylist/barber or someone who plans on using these for a long time, get a clipper with a cord. I am going back to a corded clipper as well.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Has not once let me down since I&#x27;ve gotten them. Wahl always works great for me, I recommend these or any Wahl clippers over Andis ANY DAY.</li>
    <li> I really like this clipper. It is super quiet which is great. I have tried many clippers ranging in prices and they have all pulled hair really bad and were super loud like a lawn mower running next to your ear. The only bad thing about this one is that I have only had this one for 7 months and it has only given less then 20 hair cuts and the battery went bad and will not take a charge. knowing this I still would buy it and would recommend this to anyone. I just can&#x27;t wait to finish the haircut that we had started and didn&#x27;t get to finish because the battery died. Oh well it is only hair.</li>
    <li> This is a frustrating device. It works well and does a good job of clipping, but you must leave it plugged in constantly if you want it to be available, as the battery discharges if you unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there&#x27;s an insanely bright LED on this thing that&#x27;s on while charging. It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re signaling incoming aircraft, but not so great for a bathroom where you might actually want to sleep without being blinded.</li>
    <li> battery should last more than a year and a half. the thing just died. before that it was pretty good...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for years and love it, so I ordered another one. it is very light weight and cordless.</li>
    <li> The charger doesn&#x27;t work.  Wife is a hair stylist and hasn&#x27;t had a chance to use them because of this defect. Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these because every pair of rechargeable clippers ever purchased had the life expectancy of 6 months.  The batter life on all prior was horrid at best, and I could maybe get a 5-10 minute clipper job done.  These work excellent, are well built and will run well into 30 minutes several times prior to a re-charge.  NOTE...the head actually gets warm, even hot if not lubricated prior to use.</li>
    <li> At first I really liked these clippers, but less than 3 months of owning them, the battery will no longer hold a charge.  I find this unacceptable for such an expensive product.</li>
    <li> Just received these last week.  Wow.  Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- small footprint on the bathroom counter (with charger)&lt;br /&gt;- feels like a quality product&lt;br /&gt;- cuts well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- choice in plastic guards is limited&lt;br /&gt;- plastic guards are not interchangeable with other Wahl guards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, these are working exactly like I wanted.  Much quicker than taking out my trusty Oster Light 76.  The charge appears to hold extremely well and there is no loss of power for a single cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my head, beard and goatee buzzed at 3.0mm.  I plan to use these every 2 to 3 days to keep my head and face neat and trim. So far, so good.  No snagging, no loss of power, and no wrist or hand fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are light and very easy to maneuver.  Not sure how they would hold up to longer hair for a first time buzz, but for maintenance on an already buzzed head - they seem to be the answer I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> It was my first time placing an order and it went very smooth. Will order in the future.</li>
    <li> Once we began using these they wouldn&#x27;t stay charged!! There must be a short in the base, because we can&#x27;t get them charged back up. Have used this product in the past and loved them. Don&#x27;t know what happened.</li>
    <li> I did extensive research and this one had good reviews. I thought i would give it a shot.  I tried one hair cut and all it did was pull my hair.  i shave my head and this was not a pleasent experience.  However the return was a breeze.</li>
    <li> This thing looks great, and feels high-quality.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it looking for a razor for a close head shave, not razor-close, just clipper/buzzer close.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use one of the plastic guards.. all of which were not short enough, it catches on hairs a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The closeness is adequate with no guard, but not as close as I&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I&#x27;ve had it for a couple weeks, used it 5 times now. This time it got wet and stopped working.</li>
    <li> very nice  trimer,I got this last year and still running good and my friends hair stylist loves it very much too.</li>
    <li> Very quiet. Works well.</li>
    <li> These clippers are the best! they&#x27;re Smooth, accurate and, fast! I work in a salon, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other brand!</li>
    <li> I love it so far, but it&#x27;s only been a week! I used these clippers many years ago and loved them while they lasted but the problem was they didn&#x27;t last long!! So I went back to a corded clipper. When I saw this one I thought I&#x27;d give it another try. I love the convienience of the cordless! We&#x27;ll see what happens. I hope they last longer than they used to! So far so good!</li>
    <li> These clippers work good and the battery lasts. I can do 15 haircuts with them in a day. It is best to only charge them when they die the first few times. Love these</li>
    <li> I actually like that it does not have the built in adjustment lever.  It has a solid feel and does what it says.  I bought it to augment my electric cutter, thinking that I could keep it upstairs and if I just give myself a weekly buzz, the clippings are short and go right down the shower drain without messing up the sink, etc.  I found I use it a lot more than my corded model.  Can&#x27;t think of any negatives but only owned it for a month.</li>
    <li> Great clipper, while it worked...7 months and it won&#x27;t run at all.</li>
    <li> I used this 2 times then the battery burned up. It was a huge disappointment due the amount of money I spent thinking I was getting a quality product. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Great clipper...I wish I bought this one first&lt;br /&gt;I bought over a year ago&lt;br /&gt;I use to trim my beard 3x a week and my wife cuts my hair once a month&lt;br /&gt;Has held up very very well</li>
    <li> These are officially beard trimmers but can do the work of hair clippers. I was able to fade my husbands hair with ease and give him a pretty good line up. The design of the clippers are sleek and modern. The clippers are solid but not too heavy. Easy on the wrist, flicks hair off easily. They are not extremely loud like others I have tried. I would recommend to someone that cuts their own hair and beard and wants to be wire free. The battery last a very long time. There is one clipper guard that comes with the set that I would just throw out but other than that its a good solid set.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers! Their lightweight and when charged work wonderfully! However, before I had them for even a month they stopped charging. I contacted the seller and couldn&#x27;t exchange them because I didn&#x27;t have the originally packaging. I&#x27;m sorry but I&#x27;m not going to just keep boxes around my house just incase, it should work for longer than this and I&#x27;m very disappointed. I ended up having to send them in to Wahl itself. I haven&#x27;t gotten them back yet so we&#x27;ll see. Bottom line I love these but the company selling the one I bought from isn&#x27;t good.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift to a beautician.. She Loves them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product three times and would like to finally review this product.  I have been cutting my own hair since 2001 with hair clippers mainly of the wahl corded varieties.  Although economical and powerful, the corded Wahl professional clippers can become a bit annoying to use due to their heft and weight.  It wasn&#x27;t until a few months ago that my trusty clippers started to stall and the blades became no longer functional that I finally decided to invest in a set of cordless clippers.  I stumbled upon this set after a little bit of research and decided to give it a shot.  After my uses I can give my following impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- very comfortable to use (ergonomical)&lt;br /&gt;- single charge is more than enough to get through two successive cuts (~30 min a self-cut)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to replace blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- if unplugged, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold the charge (i used for 20 min my first try, and left it unplugged.  when I went to use it again the following week, the battery was dead)&lt;br /&gt;- motor/blades not as efficient as I thought they would be (they snag every now and then. painful, but can be remedied by going slow)&lt;br /&gt;- not the cheapest route&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;If i were given the choice, I would by it again simply due to the satisfactory cutting ability and the comfort of use.  I can&#x27;t say anything about the long run, but thus far I would definitely give it a try if you are in the market for a set of hair clippers.  Just don&#x27;t expect the capability of a $300 set of cordless clippers.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my former clippers because the battery was running out.  This clipper is awesome.  I cut my own hair and these work the best of any I have tried.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts an eternity.  There are others that cut closer, but this one works well enough.  Would have liked some accessories to come with it.</li>
    <li> I read a couple bad reviews regarding the battery on this often being defective, I figured those to be the &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; unlucky few who received them.  I decided the good reviews were the majority and to go with this purchase because of how good people said it was when they got a good one....well, it is luck of the draw  &amp; I got a bad one.  Still trying to get it replaced with no luck thus far. I would reccomend buying something you have more confidence will work &amp; not have to deal with any very potential headaches.</li>
    <li> I have used wahl sterling eclipse clippers for years this is my 9th pair. This time the clippers do not meet my expectations. Think i got a dud.</li>
    <li> So far this clipper has proved to be an excellent performer. My wife (and barber) likes it much better than the clipper it replaced. The fully charged battery lasted thruout my 45+ minute haircut. I&#x27;m also using it to trim my mustache between haircuts (without a recharge so far). It is still very new so I&#x27;ll post additional comments if our opinions change.</li>
    <li> This cordless clipper works great and does not overheat like my previous electric clippers.  It is also light and does not vibrate excessively and does not scare my 5 year old son!</li>
    <li> I am cheap by nature, I didnt see the need to get a pro wahl clipper.  After going through 3 lithium ion cordless home model clippers I got tired of wasting money and creating waste.  So I bucked up and got this.  The motor is strong to cut through my hair when it is longer.  The only problem is this clipper only comes with one blade and a few blade guards.  I dont use the guards b/c I am bald.  But the blade provided doesn&#x27;t cut short enough  maybe about 1/8&amp;quot; is how short it can go.  I had to buy the fine blade which works great.  I have had this a few months now and so far so good.  I am happy.  I hope to have this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 4/6/15.  I was trying to figure out when I purchased this.  It was two years ago almost to the day. This thing is still going strong.  I use it 1x - 2x per week.  I charge it maybe every 3 -5 months.  The was the best purchase I made of 2013.  Now that I am writing this addendum to my review it will probably break.  But at $3.30 a month to cut your hair its a great deal.  That is an $.083 Hair cut at one time per week.  I am not upping the rating because I had to by the fine blade separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/22/15 It died!  I opened up the battery compartment and it looks like the battery overheated.  Its a LiOn battery and I tried to find a replacement on Amazon, but couldn&#x27;t find an exact one.  And if I did it was a NiMh battery.  So I emailed/called Wahl directly and told them I needed  new battery.  They said they can&#x27;t ship a Lithium Ion battery outside a unit and said send it to us and we will replace it for free.  Also they said they would sharpen the blades.  So I sent it back.  A few weeks later they sent me a BRAND NEW unit. No questions asked.  The only problem is I sent my fine blade in for sharpening and the new unit has the standard blade.  So I emailed Wahl with my story and they sent a replacement fine blade for free.  Wahl&#x27;s customer service is phenomenal.  Totally buy this, worth the money.  I have updated my review to 5 starts because of Wahl&#x27;s service.  I still wish they supplied it with a fine blade or made a balding blade but I can totally work with this.</li>
