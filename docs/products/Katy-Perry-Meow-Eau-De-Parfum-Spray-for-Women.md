      <li>Things that drew me in: I love the bottle.</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>I love cats.</li>
      <li>It is more of a nighttime fragrance, although I have worn it during the day many times, but I like a fragrance that has presence.</li>

      <li>Love this perfume.</li>

      <li>Very excited to give this to a friend.</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE the smell, it&#x27;s sweet with a hint of woodsie...</li>
      <li>Thought size would be larger, but love love love it!</li>
      <li>Bottles cute, purfume smells like carmel or candy-its good but doesn&#x27;t last for longer than 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I recieved pretty fast too which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>Mmmmmmm smells so girly, sweet, but not overly sweet!</li>
      <li>This is a great fragrance and has the lasting power of a true eau de parfum spray.</li>
      <li>this!!!!÷ Smells so sweet and pretty! !</li>
      <li>found it in store first and fall in love with this sweet smell.</li>
      <li>Everything was great except that it arrived after the expected delivery time which is HUGE for me</li>
      <li>It is more intense , sultry,stronger, although not over bearing plase no headaches needed.</li>
      <li>Yummy vanilla not too sweet and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It mainly smells to me like a very sweet vanilla with some pear and light gardenia honeysuckle.  </li>
      <li>But, doesn&#x27;t fade too quickly.</li>
      <li>The seller was impeccable and very careful.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re all sceptical about \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; scents, but Katy Perry has a genuine high class fragrance here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The delivery was very fast, just two days since I have prime.</li>
      <li>really fit young girls.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to make this short but informative.</li>
      <li>You can smell the vanilla right out of the bottle and smells almost coconutty too, but upon the initial spray you get a blast of fresh sweet pear, tangerine, gardenia, honeysuckle, and that vanilla.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and came in a pretty pink/ purple box</li>
      <li>Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last long on me.</li>
      <li>The lid fits tightly and the bottle has a nice heft to it.</li>
      <li>I really like the direction Katy is taking with her line of fragrances</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pleasantly sweet, sweet fragrance, the only downside being it doesn&#x27;t last longer than about 4 hours.  </li>
      <li>Definitely recommended for young teenagers and adults!</li>
      <li>Almost immediately that vanilla really starts to take over and overtake all of the other notes of the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is a bit top heavy, and I have knocked it over quite a few times.</li>
      <li>peach pair beautifully with the base of caramel vanilla and sandalwood.</li>

    <li> so cheap and smells amazing</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!÷ Smells so sweet and pretty! !</li>
    <li> Thought size would be larger, but love love love it! Go Katy!!!! This scent is very different from purr, which I also have. It is more intense , sultry,stronger, although not over bearing plase no headaches needed. This scent captures the essence of the woman who wears it. The bottles are keepsakes for me. I love cats. They are beautifully crafted with thought put into the process of a girl or woman wanting to be pretty and smell great. This one is a man catcher so be careful. You need only a little don&#x27;t go spritz crazy. I really like the direction Katy is taking with her line of fragrances, please don&#x27;t stop. The seller was impeccable and very careful. you can tell when something is done with care.Think of a dense fog and flowers all about permeating there scent all around you. That&#x27;s meow.Get it,apparently Katy does and I have alot of fragrance!!!!!!Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you A Place of Beauty you made my dream come true!!! I wanted this so bad and was feeling very left out in OZ.  I recieved pretty fast too which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> Great product and Seller to work with.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE the smell, it&#x27;s sweet with a hint of woodsie...you&#x27;ll want a purse size though to refresh, staying power isn&#x27;t all that.</li>
    <li> Stuff smells like heaven!</li>
    <li> We went shopping for a new scent for my daughter and this is the perfect match for her smells great not overpowering.  This is a signature perfume for my daughter she loves the bottle and the smell.</li>
    <li> Bottles cute, purfume smells like carmel or candy-its good but doesn&#x27;t last for longer than 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> In excellent condition. The scent is sweet and pleasant. I am keeping it.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to make this short but informative. here goes nothing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent would be described as \\&quot;Gourmond\\&quot; by the French. you guessed it, it makes you smell like an edible, tantalizing, and absolutely delicious dessert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is my go-to \\&quot;day\\&quot; fragrance. It is not overpowering, yet attractive to both sexes. Notes of pear, tangerine, and peach pair beautifully with the base of caramel vanilla and sandalwood. Sounds yummy right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your husband will love this as you spritz it on before bed. Your coworkers will say, \\&quot;You smell AMAZING! What is that?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face facts... We&#x27;re all sceptical about \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; scents, but Katy Perry has a genuine high class fragrance here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I wear this, it empowers me to face the day with a fierce Meow!</li>
    <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last long on me.</li>
    <li> Very excited to give this to a friend. Definitely recommended for young teenagers and adults! Fast shipping and came in a pretty pink/ purple box</li>
    <li> This product smells great. The delivery was very fast, just two days since I have prime. The only complaint I have is that the chain with M on it was broken upon arrival.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect scent. Yummy vanilla not too sweet and not overpowering. But, doesn&#x27;t fade too quickly. The smell is creamy vanilla with pear. There are other notes, but you can look those up, if you want. lol Really, this scent shocked me at how good it smells because normally I don&#x27;t go for the celebrity fragrances as they typically smell the same (i.e. awful). I almost cringed when I saw it was Katy Perry. Things that drew me in: I love the bottle. I adore cats, as well. The lid fits tightly and the bottle has a nice heft to it. I&#x27;m used to higher end fragrances, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting that good of quality in the bottle itself and was impressed with how nice it is. The fragrance is so beautiful and feminine and my husband likes it too. Age reference: I&#x27;m 33. He&#x27;s 40.</li>
    <li> Mmmmmmm smells so girly, sweet, but not overly sweet! Love it!</li>
    <li> Omg this smells good !! Not to overpowering and the bottle is adorable ☆</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Beautiful sweet scent. Happy with what I recieved. Shipping was quick anf seller is great. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance and has the lasting power of a true eau de parfum spray. It is more of a nighttime fragrance, although I have worn it during the day many times, but I like a fragrance that has presence. Maybe not the best choice for an office full of cubicles. The bottle is a bit top heavy, and I have knocked it over quite a few times.</li>
    <li> Nice sweet smell to it!</li>
    <li> Everything was great except that it arrived after the expected delivery time which is HUGE for me hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Scent is very nice light airy day-time scent. Not near as heavy as the Meow fragrance.</li>
    <li> You can smell the vanilla right out of the bottle and smells almost coconutty too, but upon the initial spray you get a blast of fresh sweet pear, tangerine, gardenia, honeysuckle, and that vanilla.  (There are more notes but that&#x27;s what stands out most to my nose.) Almost immediately that vanilla really starts to take over and overtake all of the other notes of the fragrance.

You&#x27;ll get alittle longer if you spray yourself heavily, which you can get away with doing with this fragrance because it&#x27;s a very soft scent, and on your clothes.  Overall, I do like this fragrance.  It has pleasant notes and smells very sweet but in no way synthetic.  I would repurchase this aswell as recommend!</li>
    <li> love this sweet smell!! really fit young girls. found it in store first and fall in love with this sweet smell. bought it online, cos it&#x27;s about 5 bucks cheaper</li>
