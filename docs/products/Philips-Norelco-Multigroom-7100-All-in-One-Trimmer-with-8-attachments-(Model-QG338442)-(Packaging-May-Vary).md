<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This trimmer is fabulous! I bought this to replace a cheap beard trimmer, which was obviously not designed for bodygrooming. This trimmer has been awesome. Nary a nick has been made while grooming, which is a major improvement over the replaced device. I highly recommend this, especially for grooming sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well for men&#x27;s grooming tool. Case that&#x27;s included really only holds the attachments. It would be a stretch to get the actual grooming tool inside the bag with the attachments.</li>
    <li> Everything about this set feels flimsy and cheap.  I bought it to replace an $18 Norelco set that I bought at a big box store several years ago.  I was looking for a step up -- and I have to say that the $18 set seems to do an even better trimming job.  I&#x27;d recommend looking further for a set with build quality that justifies this type of price.</li>
    <li> Functionally it&#x27;s alright but the cheap plastic feel is hard to get used to...</li>
    <li> Awesome device. The second one I have. The first one my brother stole from me hahaha</li>
    <li> I bought this after losing on a trip my trusted Philips Norelco G370 trimmer kit. A few years back I paid about $15 for the G370, only to see it now listed for way over $150 on Amazon - the sellers must be crazy. Anyway, I bout this as a replacement and while I like the long battery life, I don&#x27;t think the overall usability is improved from the G370 model. The angles of the trimmers make them much harder to control; the foil shaver looks and feels much narrower than the one from the G370. The beard trimmer attachment has very densely packed adjustments which make it hard to set up; it also gets clogged much more frequently requiring removal and cleanup before putting it back on the trimmer. On the plus side the body trimmer attachment works great and results in much fewer nicks and cuts, so it is not a total letdown. But I have had and used this for about four months now and I can no longer blame muscle memory when I feel like I miss the increased precision and efficiency of the old G370 model.</li>
    <li> i wish it had a 30/40 mm comb, but otherwise works great</li>
    <li> Does the job but not what I expected</li>
    <li> This is one of the best multigroom shavers I have every purchased or owned. The number of attachments makes it an all-in-one tool. Whether it be cleaning up your sideburns, beard, or whatnot, there is practically every attachment you can think of. I primarily purchased this for the bodygrooming capability and I totally love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally had an older model, but it was not longer holding a charge after a couple of years. And so I decided to upgrade to the newest model. I decided to stay with the same brand because I knew Norelco was one of the better brands in terms of bodygroomers. What is cool about this product is a &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; function which gives it that extra boost. I use it for my sideburns or the sides of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best feature about this trimmer is the blade design. It has rounded metal parts that keep from scratching the skin like the previous several Wahl brand trimmers I used. Although it feels perfect and much less painful, it doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave (I notice lots of stubble after using it with no attachments as opposed to very little stubble with other trimmers). Sadly (and as usual) this trimmer only lasted me about one month before the problems started. The top piece with the metal blades, or &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; as I call it, became loose, so loose that I have to hold it in place while using it, otherwise it rotates and ultimately comes off. This creates a very loud rattling noise - normal speed or turbo speed. The Philips trimmer has a very plastic feel (since that is what it&#x27;s mostly made of), and doubled with the loose, rattling head, it gives the impression that this brand is cheap and faulty. Things like this give me anxiety when shaving - I fear that the trimmer will completely give out and die (like my previous Wahl trimmers all have) mid shave. Maybe you&#x27;re into the partially-shaven look, but if you&#x27;re like me and just trim at random as opposed to the &amp;#34;lawn mower pattern&amp;#34; (where you start at one side and work your way across your face), this isn&#x27;t a particularly desired look. Perhaps I am getting my hopes up and being a little too positive, but there has to be a non-faulty trimmer out there somewhere. There just has to be.</li>
    <li> It worked 90% for me. The detail trimmer didn&#x27;t worked for me, maybe the way my beard grows is the problem.</li>
    <li> My husband really liked this.  It&#x27;s high quality.</li>
    <li> Lasted me about 2 months of once a week use... very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rate it higher but the Customer Service is very poor. I received Feb 28th, the ear/nose attachment failed by March 30th. After multiple calls, Philips Customer Service informed me that as a &#x27;one time&#x27; courtesy they would replace the attachment, even though this is not a warranty component! Really, used a couple of times in 30 days and not a warranty component! I should have purchased a Braun, better engineering and support.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time even getting it to run without stopping. Not a good Brand at all any longer.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I&#x27;d #$*@ myself.  This is everything I would imagine it to be and more. To start this badass off, it came with so many attachments I was like &amp;#34;what are these for&amp;#34;, but then I noticed the amazing graphics on the various attachments that described without the need of an instruction manual exactly what they were and what settings you could use them on. So the confusion aside I started to play with the various attachments to test them out at the various settings. Even when I had the attachments (especially the beard one) set to the closest shave, it was completely painless. By the time I was done testing everything on my whole body, I had realized a few things I hadn&#x27;t expected. This utility is so off the charts godly that it reversed my balding and made me lose about 20 pounds as I suddenly had abs of manliness instead of a beer gut. My sexiness had gone from Average Joe to Thoréal and I found myself changing my opinion of my body from &amp;#34;nobody wants me&amp;#34; to the aforementioned statement. Even Odin knows that there is no better utility out there on the market with so much power that even the Asgardians revere it.  Batman would never be caught without this on his utility belt, you want to know why the Universe must always have a Batman? It is because of this single versatile utility that would beat down a lantern ring and make it call him daddy. This thing is so strong that it can cut through the lasso of truth without even fraying it. Lex can only sit in envy as it was not him who came up with this epic piece of technology.</li>
    <li> Great product. couldn&#x27;t find anything like it in retail stores.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer my only complaint is that you can&#x27;t use it and charge it at the same time.</li>
    <li> I hate when the seller type something in the description and what I get is something else !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s QG3390 not QG3384, and yes there is big difference between the two models. I can&#x27;t return it back because its out of us now I wish I can give you 0 star because this is sucks!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my BF and no problems so far! He says it works great and loves the fact that he can take it in the shower..</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great, gives me the closest shave I have ever had with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> High quality!  Good design, typical of Philips.  Works great. The lithium battery is a major step forward.</li>
    <li> Looks heavy and strong but in reality feels cheap made with light plastic. The body hair trimmer guard just flattens your hair before going over it so it doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> Does the job, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> the best multigroom shavers</li>
    <li> The small trimmer in the picture (the one in the lower right) does not come with this trimmer.  Disappointing to me because I bought this to upgrade from a cheap trimmer with a similar trim head profile purchased from the local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  COSTCO has the same thing currently on sale for $35 less.  My bad for not shopping price before I ordered.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been working fine off the first charge. My previous Philips trimmer had major battery charging issues and broke easily. I&#x27;m hoping this one is a bit more robust in that area. The nose and ear trimmer doesn&#x27;t have the circular cutter that most are used to, but this one sided mini-trimmer that can be difficult to gauge what you are actually cutting. The fitting of the attachments requires a little more ffort than the previous trimmer, but are more solid and less prone to pop off. The length adjustment is their own system with super tiny numbers, so use the force on the legth there and remember the number you had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those small grips, it&#x27;s well built and has a more solid professional feel. I hope it lasts longer than the last one.</li>
    <li> The shaver does not shave well and the grooming kits are cheap made of cheap plastic can break easily..... gave this as a gift to my husband, we were  both very disappointed......thanks for the delivery, it was very fast thats why im rating this product as a two stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on cheap clippers over the years as I like to save money on my hair during the summertime. Now that I&#x27;m growing a goatee, I wanted something that would work on that as well. I&#x27;ve had the product for about a month or so now and use the electric razor about two to three times per week. It&#x27;s the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, plus the trimmer attachment works very well on keeping my goatee clean too. I have yet to try it on my head, but I&#x27;ve had zero problems. I would recommend that you turn on the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; option and just leave it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you may have to adjust your grip to keep from accidentally turning it off while in use. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. If you want something better, then you&#x27;ll probably end up paying a lot more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, we just see how long it lasts. All of my others have died for one reason or another within 2 years.</li>
    <li> I would give this product a zero star if I could. I bought this product because I dropped and broke my old Philips QC5170&#x27;s comb; that clipper was so awesome that I decided to replace it with another Philips product-what a big mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Like my old QC5170, the blades don&#x27;t need oil for lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;All-in-one head-to-toe styling&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Showerproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;My head now looks like tiger stripes! It didn&#x27;t clip my hair evenly at all! I am returning this clipper ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;I started at setting 10, then moved down to 8, to 5, and still couldn&#x27;t get even cuts--it just would not clip evenly/properly! I will have to definitely go to a barber shop after this and I haven&#x27;t set my feet in one in over 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd hair clipper; the 2 previous ones cut evenly even though I paid less for each of them!&lt;br /&gt;(I paid ~$15 for a cheap Wahl hair clipper and ~$40 for the QC5170 that I got it when it was on sale.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair with an electric hair clipper for over 3 years now, so I know it is not me but this clipper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps, I got a defective one, but I am not willing to risk exchanging it for the same model. Also, it might work well as a beard/body groomer; I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it out and I&#x27;m not going to risk it. Nevertheless, it does fail miserably as a hair clipper. You should be extremely careful/cautious if you will be using this a few days before an important interview like I did. This product is really that bad, as I think it is the first product I am compelled to write a review about--to warn others from making the same mistake as I did. This product is currently available at my local Costco, BTW.</li>
    <li> You need to handle it with care otherwise you may press on its switch, so its handling is not comfortable, also the replacement parts are of weak materials.</li>
    <li> Very nice, removed 3 product from my sink drawer and replace with one that work better than other 3.  I use everday and have not needed to recharge yet.</li>
    <li> One of the best, Im rly happy with it</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have bought,  and I have bought many over the years.  Holds a charge nicely and I don&#x27;t have to do many passes to get the look I like.</li>
    <li> It works really well and is powerful enough.  I had the previous model that died.  They changed the button and now it is a push button on the front.  It is directly where you hold it when you shave your head.  I have had to change my hold as to not turn it off.  It has a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; button!  if this isn&#x27;t blatantly marketed to men then I have no idea.  It has a turbo!!!  You turn turbo on and never turn it off.  Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;One other issue is that the previous model never got clogged with hair and I never had to use oil.  This one for some reason gets jammed up and every now and then I have to use oil to keep it lubed.&lt;br /&gt;All in all none of it is a deal breaker and I love the ability to use it in the shower with no worries.</li>
    <li> Versatile product due to lots of great attachments with a useful little bag to keep them all in. Feels a little short on power, but gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seeing lots of good reviews for the battery life of this product. My experience doesn&#x27;t match those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a year and until two weeks ago I had only used it to maintain a full beard, maybe once every 2 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved my beard off and now use this every few days with no guard attachment. This takes me 5 minutes tops, but I have to charge it every other use. Shaving the beard off took substantially longer, probably 30-45 minutes, and the charge lasted the whole time. I had charged it just before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why is my battery draining while sitting idle? And why can&#x27;t it be used while plugged in? Seriously what&#x27;s the point of that? How often are people not using this product at home?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost feels like planned obsolescence. Battery goes to crap, can&#x27;t replace it and can&#x27;t use it while plugged in to AC. This would be at least a 4 star review if I could just use the thing while it&#x27;s plugged into the wall.</li>
    <li> The settings for the attachments are clumsy</li>
    <li> Great product but charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough. Brand new and I use it once and it&#x27;s dead. Scared to see how the battery holds when it&#x27;s a year old.</li>
    <li> Works very well with every attachment doing what it&#x27;s designed to accomplish with satisfactory or better results.  I use it for head (shaved), beard trimming, neck shaving and body hair trimming.  I have been able to achieve desired results in each are with very short learning curve as far as figuring out what attachments at what settings work best.  My only complaint is that the storage bag is completely inadequate.  With the number of attachments, you have fumble around in there for what you are looking for and, of greater concern, the shaver attachments will certainly get damaged in the bag before too long (probably from banging against the clipper attachments).  It should have really come with a more protective and organized storage bag/case.</li>
    <li> I bought this item mainly for beard shaving. After shaving for the first time with the beard trimmer I got satisfied with the final result. The cut seems to be quite precise and uniform and I haven&#x27;t notice any major irregularities. So far I didn&#x27;t fell the need to use the turbo function, meaning that it cuts quite well with normal speed. The nose appliance does not seem to work so perfectly, though. I believe this appliance could used better improvement. The extra case that comes along with the package could be a bit bigger. I can only keep inside the charger, the shaver and one trimmer. Still, overall it seems a quite good item with a lot of cutting options that work. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended!  Husband and son love it.</li>
    <li> Its smooth and fast for trim. Its worth the money you pay.</li>
    <li> Love it great control with the multiply settings. Typical Norelco quality</li>
    <li> This is a great product for men for shaving and grooming. I liked the product very much as it has multiple trimmer for complete grooming and shaving. It is very easy to use. It has complete guideline for how to use. Thoroughly impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Works well. Feels good in the hand.</li>
    <li> Like lithium battery.  Good Product.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my husband, works well he loves it.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves all the attachments and how fast it charges. Warranty is a plus also</li>
    <li> This is more expensive than the cheaper model I had in the past, but so far, the metal clipper head, the rechargeable battery, and the clean cutting functionality make it well worth the additional investment.  And, most of the heads and attachments from the cheaper model work interchangeably with this one.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great razor. I have bought three or four of them in the last year. Two didn&#x27;t last a month and one of them didn&#x27;t shave worth a darn. This one shaves nearly as close as a razor (I wen&#x27;t to one of these because I absolutely will never buy another package of $50 blades). All of the attachments work great.</li>
    <li> Excellent kit. Absolutely love it. I use every attachment. I recommend using on dry skin only. I think I paid 50-55 bucks at Costco. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> After looking through a lot of reviews I settled on this one. My husband is happy with it, but I thought it had a stand as is stated in the description. Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for  over a month now and I&#x27;m really happy with it. It has really simplified grooming and it does a fantastic job from head to toe. I used it constantly in and out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After two years of heavy use the cradle where the various shaving attachments lock into, no longer holds the attachments in place. I think it is just worn out. It still works great if you are shaving your head and have a cutting guide on. I really like the ease and precision of this thing. I&#x27;ll be getting another one just like it.</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old and I have been using Norelco products since I was 14 years old. This trimmer is well made and does everything that I want in a single trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Kenneth</li>
    <li> Complete, functional, wireless, easy to use and carry. Fits into any type of luggage.</li>
    <li> I saw several Youtube grooming videos that recommended this for creating a 5&#x27;0 clock shadow look - and this failed miserably. I use the body trimmer occasionally to trim chest hair but it does a bad job even there. I am not hairy at all and a Braun does a much better job than this useless junk</li>
    <li> Really very good, alone that on having used it neither cuts since of root the beard doesn&#x27;t even make the face soft using the one that corresponds for the face.</li>
    <li> Works great,  love the long battery life.  Wish the storage case was really a case and not just the packaging,  but still a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these at Costco last year just because I couldn&#x27;t wait for shipping (I live in Alaska). The battery holds a good charge and everything was going fine until today. About 3/4 into my beard trim, the razor head just snapped off and flew across the sink. I was applying average pressure on the head, nothing major since I was just trimming hair down, not removing it entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I looked at the broken part, I was dumbfounded to see that the two anchor points that hold the razor head assembly in place were black plastic. All the stress applied to the razor is placed directly on those two thin plastic columns into which the head assembly is screwed into. I&#x27;m no engineer, but this just seems like a really poor design if the objective was to create a long lasting, quality product. However, if the objective was to create a razor that will break after a year or so... then well done chaps. Well done.</li>
    <li> seems the quality is little poor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but generally it&#x27;s okay and do its work</li>
    <li> Great groomer recieved on time.</li>
    <li> Hes its really best Multigroom in his  class for 70$ i think you can&#x27;t buy better ;)</li>
    <li> Works very nice for me, I use it to groom my beard every weekend.&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t use it kind of daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For daily use, I cannot give advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a very good product for weekend use.</li>
    <li> I like this because it works so much better than a previous unit I had, much cleaner shaving with it. storage case is ok, could be higher quality but it does the job, all in all I like it!</li>
    <li> One of the best All-In-One products I&#x27;ve seen. Very nice set of tools. Works as advertised from head-to-toe. It has a built-in battery, very convenient when using without having to plug it in. Comes with a very thorough user-friendly manual that you should READ and follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it mainly for body hair trimming and shaving. My suggestion is to use it when your SKIN IS DRY. Trying to shave wet with shaving gel has proven to be too difficult and troublesome. Just be careful when shaving sensitive areas, follow instructions, be patient, and you will love it. Does not hurt at all even when using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holding case that comes with it is nice enough and it gets the job done. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Unit feels very light in my hands, plastic parts seem very fragile. Not even near as being as powerful as corded versions (Wahl for example). Good as a carry on on trips but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> This is a great and solidly made multi grooming kit. Highly recommended!!! I use it strictly for my beard to keep my beard tight and it does a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great variety of trimmer  and useful for almost all body parts, especially for sensitive skins</li>
    <li> Much better than the cheapo trimmers I have been buying.</li>
    <li> Nice little shaver, cheaper than store price.</li>
    <li> It does a pretty good job.  With the attachment I use to get the closest cut (on the three setting), it clogged with hair easily, so I had to frequently remove the hair to keep cutting easily. It has rounded edges and better bracing that works well for delicate body areas.  The other attachments have angles that could jab, but would probably not clog as easily.  There are a lot of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had two units shipped and one was dead on arrival (DOA).  Amazon customer service to the rescue.  I was able to print my own shipping label and process the return on-line.  Didn&#x27;t have to talk to anyone and had my replacement in a couple days.  Love Amazon&#x27;s return service though I&#x27;ve only used it twice in many purchases I&#x27;ve done on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great. . I get good trims..</li>
    <li> I love this product so much it all I use and it&#x27;s perfect I find that it works best while dray shaving I use it to shave everything and I love it the battery is great</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco beard trimmer for years and it still is running perfect.  However when I saw this one with all the different attachments I had to have it.  It works great, love the perks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this! I got it for my BF for XMAS. He was very specific with what he wanted: something that can shave everywhere: beard, head, body AND can be used in the shower! By the time this was opened for XMAS, his beard was nearly two inches thick and even without any combs the blade easily slid through cutting the hair off clean, without nicks or hesitation! He raves about it every use.</li>
    <li> Love this product but couple of these combs it comes with break easily with longer hair so use cautiously...</li>
    <li> Product worked great..that is till it died on me. Considering that this thing costs $70, I expected it to last for more than 6 months.</li>
