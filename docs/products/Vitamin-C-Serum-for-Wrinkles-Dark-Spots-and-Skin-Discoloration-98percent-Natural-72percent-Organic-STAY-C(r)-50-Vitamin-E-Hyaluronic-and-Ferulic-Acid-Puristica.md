      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I get dark spots and discoloration from the sun and Vitamin C helps to even my skin tone plus has amazing ant-aging (antioxidant) properties.  </li>

      <li>It came fast, well packaged, and sealed so there was no possible chances of leaks.  </li>

      <li>so far i can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference but have not been using for that long..</li>
      <li>Not only does it make a noticeable difference on your skin in terms of hydrating it, but it definitely helps remove those dark circles that makes me look so much older and so much more tired than I am.  </li>

<li> , it has nearly taken away all my dark spots!</li>
<li> just a little over a week...will update later</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I bought the double size certain that I would like it because of the reviews, but I now regret that choice.  </li>
<li> This Vitamin C Serum by Puristica arrived well packaged and in 2 days as expected with my Amazon Prime membership.</li>
<li> ; it is very watery and thin compared to the previous product I used (Serumtologie Vitamin C Serum 22)</li>
<li> I use this with 2 of puristicas other products for skin problems I have.  </li>
<li> Otherwise, probably return to the other product just for the texture alone.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t been using this at all and have been using other vitamin C serums instead.</li>
<li> It is a combination treatment for wrinkles, dark spots, uv/damage which I have.  </li>
<li> Less dark circles and the spots seem to be fading.  </li>
<li> It has other heavy hitting ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Vitamin E, Organic Aloe, and Jojoba Oil.</li>
<li> and Sally Hansen Clinical Lipcare Collection)&lt;br /&gt;the lines have been less visible.  </li>
<li> I have been using these for less than a month now.&lt;br</li>
<li> Dark spots are much less noticable, and I&#x27;m noticing a decrease in wrinkles as well!</li>
<li> Cleared up my dark spots!</li>
<li> And had a very odd smell to it.</li>
<li> I have acne scars and this has made them slowly disappear without overly drying out my skin.</li>
<li> My skin is brighter after a few days!!  </li>
<li> I also have weird insect bite scarring on my arms and while what the doctor prescribed helped with the itching, this serum has helped reduce the appearance of the dark spots caused by the insect bites.</li>
<li> This is the least expensive product I have used</li>
<li> I had some nasty dark spots on my skin before and it made me lose my confidence within myself</li>
<li> I am really disappointed in the smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s a really great product and works as it says it does.  I really love this company and will continue to use their products.  I am a very happy customer. The product also arrived early! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> OMG double sized anti-aging serum for this price?  I love the product.  Not only does it make a noticeable difference on your skin in terms of hydrating it, but it definitely helps remove those dark circles that makes me look so much older and so much more tired than I am.  I enjoyed this product.  It came fast, well packaged, and sealed so there was no possible chances of leaks.  It has a lovely scent and really really was easy to apply.  I just can&#x27;t say enough good about Puristica and their products.  I&#x27;m definitely a repeat customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum by Puristica arrived well packaged and in 2 days as expected with my Amazon Prime membership. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and have started to see some results.  This serum has a pleasant smell (some Vitamin C products don&#x27;t) and it is absorbed quickly by my skin. It does not leave it tacky or greasy. I have seen a positive change in my under eye dark circles and the lines there. I have a sun spot on my forehead caused by sun damage and it has lessened. I have used prescription strength medicine that has not touched that spot.  My skin tone overall looks better.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional price and am happy to share my opinion. I am impressed with this serum. It has other heavy hitting ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Vitamin E, Organic Aloe, and Jojoba Oil. I recommend this product to others with sun and age problems showing up on their faces.</li>
    <li> so far i can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference but have not been using for that long..just a little over a week...will update later</li>
    <li> The product shipped in a timely manner and came in a box that kept it well protected. The product had a cloudy orange consistency. And had a very odd smell to it. I&#x27;ve purchased many other vitamin see serum&#x27;s and this one by far has been my least favorite.I think the product may have been old.</li>
    <li> I have acne scars and this has made them slowly disappear without overly drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 and oily skin. I have tried some Vit C serums and so far this is the best. Since first week using it I notice my face was clear and glowing. Great value for quality and size. Love it</li>
    <li> This is a great value! It really makes my skin look better and I&#x27;m sure I will continue using it for awhile. My skin looks better and seems to look more hydrated and I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement to my fine lines.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed in the smell. The product seems to work, I&#x27;ll know more in a month, but the smell is not attractive.</li>

The redness I had has completely disappeared.  This is the least expensive product I have used and I&#x27;am thrilled with the results I have seen in such a short time.  I will continue to use this product.   I received this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as promised. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This serum has worked wonders for my skin, I am so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, great deal.</li>
    <li> I am trying this product mainly because it received good reviews and it is a better deal.  I don&#x27;t like the consistency however; it is very watery and thin compared to the previous product I used (Serumtologie Vitamin C Serum 22) Will finish off the bottle and see if anything remarkable happens.

    <li> Excellent! Love how smooth my skin feels!</li>
    <li> Love this serum! I have adult acne and with the acne comes the scarring. I have plenty of dark spots (I could share lol) and this vitamin c serum has definitely helped lighten those spots. I also have weird insect bite scarring on my arms and while what the doctor prescribed helped with the itching, this serum has helped reduce the appearance of the dark spots caused by the insect bites. Definitely in my top 5 products ever!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  My skin is brighter after a few days!!  Less dark circles and the spots seem to be fading.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin C Serum, my skin feels very good and younger</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:fab3e7817419c22411f478e6acf9d997]]Big fan of this product. It is concentrated with a lot more vitamin C than most serums that compare to it, and it has really helped with my \\&quot;I&#x27;m 30\\&quot; aging issues. Dark spots are much less noticable, and I&#x27;m noticing a decrease in wrinkles as well!</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know how it works by itself.  I&#x27;ve been using it along with another product.&lt;br /&gt;But, I can tell you that since I started using both products(Puristica Vit C Serum and Moist. and Sally Hansen Clinical Lipcare Collection)&lt;br /&gt;the lines have been less visible.  I have been using these for less than a month now.&lt;br /&gt;So, my opinion is both products are working and doing what they say they do .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent of this one.  I like vitamin C serums and I have tried several of them.  The scent on this one just seems really &#x27;off&#x27;.  Unfortunately, I bought the double size certain that I would like it because of the reviews, but I now regret that choice.  I haven&#x27;t been using this at all and have been using other vitamin C serums instead.</li>
    <li> This serum absorbs quickly and acts as a great base for my moisturizer (leaves my skin with a toned feel).  Vitamin C has really done wonders for my skin... I get dark spots and discoloration from the sun and Vitamin C helps to even my skin tone plus has amazing ant-aging (antioxidant) properties.  I like that this serum absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait for 30 minutes before continuing with my beauty routine and I know my skin is actually getting the benefit of the Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my dark spots! I had some nasty dark spots on my skin before and it made me lose my confidence within myself so I turned to online to look for a solution and found this treatment. I&#x27;ve used it for around 2 weeks and I have seen results, it has nearly taken away all my dark spots! I love it and would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
