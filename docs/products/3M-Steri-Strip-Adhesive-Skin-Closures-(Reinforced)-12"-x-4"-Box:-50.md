    <li> Love these to cover patches I have to wear</li>
    <li> Added these to my various first aid kits, haven&#x27;t had the need to use any.  Seem like a quality product.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what it stated, I was very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> It is what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Must have for backpacking or survival kit. If you know how to use it will replace skin suture kit. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> We bought these for an upcoming medical mission. Items came quickly and as described. The product looks high quality.  We can&#x27;t wait to put it in use.</li>
    <li> After having an abdominal surgery I ordered these for the extra support.  They worked great, there is way more in the box than you would think.  I&#x27;ve got plenty left over and will be adding these to my first aid kit.</li>
    <li> These are the filament tape version which look/feel like packing tape. I had wanted the beige colored strips as my FACS uses them with some kind of adhesive to cover up after he goes on mole patrol and makes me a Holey one. There is nothing wrong w/the product, just the user. They came in a nice case and were clean and nicely packed.</li>
    <li> If you are someone with health issues, and were hoping for the flesh tone bandage; THEY DON&#x27;T SELL THEM!!! It was foolish of me to think thats what color they would be since I have never seen them any other color.. now stuck with a very expensive BOX OF 50  bandaids that might look great on my butt!</li>
    <li> They worked for what I needed them to work for. Easy to use and work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping not to have to try them out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the super fast delivery! with a 3-5 business day order, it actually came quicker than I expected! Product came as described. I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> These are the best product for elderly skin tears. I keep them on hand for my mother whenever she accidentally hits her hand or arm against something. These were shipped quickly and arrived in great fashion. Thank you</li>
    <li> OK I guess, have not used them yet</li>
    <li> This was a good buy for steri-strips, which everyone should have in their first aid kit.</li>
    <li> if you look at these in a brick and mortar store they are much more expensive. They are good to have on hand (busy with sports) and part of our backpacking emergency and car kits.</li>
    <li> Perfect, high quality!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for first aid kits.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipping, thank you!</li>
    <li> Great deal, and quality</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a retired or  nurse, this is a great price for this product! and they work great too! everyone should have these in their medicine cabinet</li>
