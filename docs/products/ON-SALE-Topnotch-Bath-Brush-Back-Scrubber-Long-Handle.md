<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Although this item was advertised as having a long handle, I was disappointed when I received it. The handle is average in length, I would not call it a long handled brush.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for dry brushing before I bath. It&#x27;s not super stiff so I can tolerate the brushing without pain. It works for me.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s been a while since my back got a good scrubbing but this is ROUGH. Too stiff for my taste (and I was really hoping to get a good back-scratching in while washing). I also chose this one because reviews on other back brushes mentioned that it was hard to reach your back with a brush &amp;#34;as straight as a ruler,&amp;#34; and it is. I looks curved, and it is slightly, but not in a good way. If anything, the curve makes it HARDER to scrub my back. The head is not angled so it&#x27;s pretty-much just the bottom of the brush (on the handle end) that sees any action at all. It&#x27;s better to go from underneath than over-the-shoulder but still sucky. The company was great and emailed right away to make sure I got it and it was in good condition and all and I will keep it, but only use it rarely or just for dry skin brushing when I&#x27;m feeling brave. It also takes a tremendous amount of body wash to lather it and even then, plan on losing some skin layers!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s only so much you can say about a bath brush, but this is a good one. The fact that it&#x27;s plastic means you don&#x27;t have to worry about rotten wood from storing it in the shower. The bristles are sturdy enough to be effective, but not so hard as to rub your skin raw. It has a handy rope tied at the end so you can hang it on a hook in your shower.  Personally, I partially unhooked one of my metal shower curtain rings and I hang it on the backside of that for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good buy. I can&#x27;t think of any other features I&#x27;d look for, so I consider this a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> Too stiff for my skin so I use this to clean my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Good size, good firmness. I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Excellent, simply exfoliating back/body brush. It does what it says and it&#x27;s certainly worth the money and follow up customer service.</li>
    <li> Not a good product. Despite the fact that I always shake out and hang dry all my brushes after the shower, so they&#x27;re fully dry after each shower, this brush was falling apart after only a few weeks of use.  The bristles were coming out bit by bit all over the shower floor, and the plastic head just broke suddenly in half in the middle of a shower, luckily missing my foot.  Even if wooden-handled brushes deteriorate as well, I&#x27;ve never had a wooden brush break in half so suddenly and so soon.  Save yourself, and find yourself a decent wooden brush rather than this plastic version.</li>
    <li> I like this brush.  It leaves the skin on my back invigorated and I am FINALLY able to scrub my back without having to resort to contortions or slipping in the shower.  It&#x27;s about time I spoiled myself with this sort of thing.</li>
    <li> handle is not particularly long &amp; bristles are much too stiff for my comfiort</li>
    <li> great for scrubbing your back but the bristles are a bit hard</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It really does a good job on my back and feels like a good back scratching at the same  time.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> I had a wooden, natural bristled brush in my cart for some time even tho my previous two fell apart rather quickly what with the constant wetting and drying they go thru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even remember why I decided to check this one out, maybe just finding it for half the price and my back was itching? Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, one of the first reviews sold me almost immediately with a video of the brush and you could HEAR how substantial the bristles are in the video and when it comes to scrubbing my back and legs and feet I like the bristles to have some &amp;#34;backbone&amp;#34;, and this one definitely does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For such a decent price this brush is REALLY nice!  It can handle some decent scrubbing without scratching the skin, and of course if your skin is more sensitive you just soak it in warm water for a few minutes and it softens up, plus, You just don&#x27;t use as much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By nature the style is sturdier and will last longer than it&#x27;s natural counterparts.  The bristles are a bit longer than any natural ones I&#x27;ve ever seen too making it also more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN the downloadable instructions for dry brushing, of which I&#x27;d only recently heard, are great!  Lots of info without overwhelming you and then detailed charts of how exactly to brush and in which direction. Leaving the beginner with no doubts about whether or not they&#x27;re doing it correctly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disabled with energy at a premium so I haven&#x27;t incorporated it into my routine yet, but am looking forward to it, I&#x27;ll give just about anything a decent shot if there&#x27;s a chance it&#x27;ll improve my health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy purchase and saved money!  Sometimes going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ISN&#x27;T the best option, as there are less places for microbes to grow on this brush if you keep it clean and dry in between uses.</li>
    <li> Ahhh!  A perfect body scrub without straining my shoulders to reach everywhere.  Very good purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality &amp; Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> bristles are firm enough to get the job done yet soft enough to do it comfortably - holds soap suds well</li>
    <li> Brush does everything that is advertised. Good product</li>
    <li> Expensive but much better than what I could find locally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried loofahs and the body scrubbers of the mesh type material.  They simply do not compare!  This brush truly works and gives you the option of using it dry which is a service they offer in most top notch salons to aid in circulation, exfoliation, and detoxification.  You can use it wet as well with a thick liquid soap and it performs wonderfully well on those hard to reach places like your back.  I love this brush!  I wish I had found it earlier, and no, other body brushes do not come close.</li>
    <li> Like it  but don&#x27;t use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Very nice bath brush.</li>
    <li> a little harsh on skin but it looks as new as when I got it half a year ago</li>
    <li> its rough on the skin.  i rather use it to scrub the walls n tub.</li>
    <li> I like firm brushes. Most of the ones I tried before were just too soft and it defeated the purpose of having a back brush. This brush is awesome though. Nice and sturdy bristles.</li>
    <li> The bristles are a bit stiff and can be a weapon if not used carefully :p  This of course seems to be an issue more when it&#x27;s used in the shower and your skin is more sensitive than usual; when used dry, it&#x27;s not as bad.  As an exfoliator, I feel this works, then.  I typically use it on a weekly basis.  I probably would not be able to use it in the same spots more than once every few days, at the soonest.  The handle seems long enough for me to reach the hard parts on my back with relative ease, but I typically focus mostly on my legs, which are usually more exposed.  After use, my skin has a slight tingly feeling and can feel a bit warm to the touch due to the stimulation to the nerves and increased blood flow.  I have no problem with this, but I&#x27;m sure those with more sensitive skin may.  I make sure to put on lotion afterward to help protect and moisturize the newly sensitized skin, and I&#x27;m all set!</li>
    <li> The top half broke as i went to use the first time?&amp;#62;?junky</li>
    <li> perfect for me.  now I can reach my back and feet .</li>
    <li> This is a great back brush!  It feels very sturdy to me and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to break like some others I&#x27;ve had. It rinses clean easily, and I hang it to dry and no mold has appeared at all. Thanks to this brush I have a great soft back that is no longer itchy and dry. Thanks for such a great quality brush!</li>
    <li> It works quite well to help me clean my back. It seems to clean better than some of the scrubbie things.</li>
    <li> Works OK. I would have liked a longer handle and a stiffer brush.</li>
    <li> Softly does it! Not abrasive and yet firm enough. Good product.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent for the price. I use it with my body scrub to massage my skin. My skin is smooth and much less dry especially in the hard winter weather we have in Chicago.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery! I ordered this for an elderly friend who has having trouble reaching her back when bathing and it&#x27;s made a big difference in her independence. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Hello,  I like Fuller Brush. They have quality products. However, I wanted a long handle shower brush.</li>
    <li> This brush feels soft to the touch but hard on the back like a hard tooth bush. I&#x27;ll use it as a back up to remind me when the one I use goes bad quickly get another one of my preferred brushes.</li>
    <li> The feel of brush is not the same as natural one but serve the purpose.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush. Only gave 3 stars because this says long handle in the title but the handle is not that long. Does the job though i guess.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I bought two of these and this one isn&#x27;t any better than the other one.  Bristles are sparse and don&#x27;t hold soap.</li>
    <li> Good brush stiffness and genuinely long handle. Great for use with shower gels.</li>
    <li> Appears to be a good length, handle is sturdy and the brushes feel good on the back when washing, so thats a home run in my books!</li>
    <li> The brush is described as having a &amp;#34;LONG Handle.&amp;#34; I beg to differ- SHORT it is- and really needs an additional 4&amp;#34;-5&amp;#34; to be truly useful.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, in use I wouldn&#x27;t describe the sensation as particularly pleasant. On the upside, it is well made- but for me, that doesn&#x27;t offset its drawbacks.</li>
    <li> It arrive fast and the product is great! I love how its not super soft but not very hard either. It&#x27;s a perfect back massage! Heaven on earth! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The. Shower. Bush. Good. And. Strong. Gust. Right. The. Head. Of. The. Brush. Is. 2 1/2. By  3  1/2. Length. Of. The. Shower. Brush. Is. 14. Inches. Long. But. 16.  Inches. Would. Better. If. Short. Arms</li>
    <li> This is a great scrub brush. The bristles are stiff enough to exfoliate well and the handle is the right length and pretty sturdy. The color is meh but who cares.</li>
    <li> Due to shoulder injury, it is difficult for me to scratch or wash my back. This brush works great for in the tub/shower or even for those hard to reach itches. Not too hard, not too soft.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush and it appears to be sturdy.</li>
    <li> Not bad. You do need to soak the brush to soften it a bit, &amp; the bristles are a little tough to soap up, but it does work. Like many others have said, the handle could stand to be a bit longer, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> handle too short for me ....good for legs and feet....only other problem is that  it broke at base now what?  not even one week and am out of money</li>
    <li> Bristles are a bit too rough for my preference. a string would have made this a 4-5 star item.</li>
    <li> this brush is way too short.  It needs to be another 6 inches longer.</li>
    <li> A little stiffer than wanted.</li>
    <li> Brush is very soft, but does a good job.  Liquid body wash doesn&#x27;t disappear into bristles before applying.</li>
    <li> I was totally fooled. This brush is for a tiny person. I can&#x27;t even reach the middle of my back with it. wasted my $$$$$</li>
    <li> Exactly As Expected. Good Delivery Time.</li>
    <li> Simply wonderful will order another one.  The did just what I needed it to do....thank you for your body brush</li>
    <li> The bristles are harder than I thought they&#x27;d be, so I&#x27;m hardly touching my skin with them.  However, the brush is well made.</li>
    <li> The handle was too short for the brush to reach the center of my back. The handle needs to be about 4 inches longer.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Good product.  Promptly delivered.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, love!!!! Ordered four. Great quality, very useful and well made. You will not be disappointed. Order more than one for back up. Excellent gift giving for family, friends, and guests.</li>
    <li> Bristles are a little still/scratchy for my liking.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and my kid does too but my husband thinks it is a bit hard. I think it is just fine. The handle is long enough to reach my back and not so big that gets in the way. I am 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and my husband is 6&#x27;. The brush works well for both of us.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like to make sure all those hard to reach places are taken care of. A little dab of body wash on the scrubber and the soft bristles gently clean your back. It was a nice experience as I have always just used a wash cloth and my hands. I was super excited when I got this in the mail and took shower almost immediately after opening it. It was everything I thought it would be. Soothing, soft, and cleansing! Love it! Feel like I went and had a spa day.</li>
    <li> Its advertised as long handled but in fact its too short. It is made very well but I can not reach where I need to.</li>
    <li> A very good product.  The bristles are firm, yet not harsh.  I think if there was any shortcoming at all it is that I would have preferred that it had a bit longer handle.  Overall, I am not sorry for making this purchase and will likely buy another one.</li>
    <li> The brush works great! Exactly what I expected, except I was expecting the handle to be longer when it is advertised as a long handle brush,  it still only reaches tabout your shoulder blades. that&#x27;s the only reason why it didn&#x27;t get full stars.</li>
    <li> These are not medium bristles .They are so soft this brush is useless.</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at dry brushing and I think this brush is perfect for that - bristles are firm enough to be invigorating but not so firm as to hurt my skin. However the included eBook is wordy and amateurish - filled with typos and overblown claims such as dry brushing will eliminate the need for lotion and make your skin &amp;#34;literally glowing&amp;#34; (really? LITERALLY glowing!?). The book could have been a lot more scientific and concise, but it did include a lot of information and the brush itself really is nice!</li>
    <li> The brush is a little stiffer than I expected. I hope it will soften up a little with use. I missed the chose of colors so I ended up with pink. As a man I would have liked blue more even though color doesn&#x27;t effect how it works.</li>
    <li> I love to use this brush before I shave. It is excellent for exfoliation and shaving prep work. The bristles do soften after the first use, so just be careful not to use it on sensitive areas unless you run the bristles under warm or hot water so they can soften up a bit. I also use this brush to reach those hard to get to back areas and scrub the dead skin off my feet. Love this thing!!</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of bath brushes and always thought I had to have one with a wooden handle for some reason.  Now after using this pink one I have no idea why.&lt;br /&gt;When this arrived, I was amazed and pleased by how pretty it is.  The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice at all.  It is a gorgeous shade of translucent pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main characteristic of a great body brush is the bristles.  Do you need expensive natural ones? No!  They turn black after a while and I\\&quot;m not sure if it&#x27;s mold or what, but I just threw away an expensive one I had with a wooden handle and natural bristles because they had turned black at the part where they meet the wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on this are not too soft and not too rough.  It feels wonderful against the skin, and the bristles are the perfect texture and firmness. It feels soft and yet has enough spring and body to really scrub the skin.  I like to use this with liquid soap and this does a better job of really scrubbing the skin, while stimulating the circulation, than any other brush I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to feel super clean and like I&#x27;ve really scrubbed my skin, and feel it stimulates the circulation while getting all oil and dirt out of the pores.  This brush works great and I love how it looks.  The handle is the longest I&#x27;ve seen on a body brush so I can get all of my back with it.  If you&#x27;ve never tried a good body brush you will like this one.  It&#x27;s perfect.  And it looks good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent a free sample for testing and review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shower brush, it works. Slightly stiff bristles, has a rope to hang.</li>
    <li> Like this backbrush; not too stiff and comfortable to hold. The handle could be a little longer...but it&#x27;s practical and pretty.</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy product. It has a curved long handle so you can reach your entire back. The bristles are firm enough so you can really feel clean but still soft. I would definitely recommend this product. I might buy a few more to make Christmas baskets for family and friends. Also, I love anything pink being the only female in a house of 7 they will know for sure which one is moms!</li>
    <li> my husband absolutely loves it.  i am not able to use it due limitations on arm movements.</li>
    <li> The long handle will reach just about anywhere you need it to. The bristles are still enough yet solf enough to use on my super sensitive feet without me feeling like I am torturing myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to anyone looking for a solid Bath Brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out various back brushes lately for the shower since the ones I used to get are no longer being made (or impossible to find) and I thought I would try out this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the bristles are great. They aren&#x27;t SUPER HARD where they scratch off your skin, but they are firm enough that they really clean well. I hate back brushes with the fluffy, soft bristles. But I also hate the ones that feel like steel wool. There&#x27;s a happy medium in there and this brush is perfect, in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice and sturdy- no snapping handles or flimsy plastic with this back brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue with it is the size. It&#x27;s not short, but it&#x27;s not long enough for me. I like one of those brushes that are extra long, the ones that reach your entire back when used &amp;#34;over the shoulder&amp;#34;. Another issue is the size of the brush head- it&#x27;s bit smaller than what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the pros outweigh the cons with this one- sturdy and durable and long-lasting takes precedence over perfect size, since all the &amp;#34;perfect size&amp;#34; brushes I have tried either snap in half with the tiniest bit of pressure or wind up mildewing and falling apart after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can deal with the slightly compact size, and firm bristles, I&#x27;d recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Such a nice brush!  The length is perfect, longer than others I&#x27;ve used.  The head is largers than others, too.  The bristles seem just right for my skin, so I hope this lasts a good long time.  Seems very sturdy.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moC3H93QD4K36S]]I have a couple of bath brushes and this one shot up right to the favorite status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✅ The feel of the bristles: a nice balance between soft and stiff. It stiffer than many brushes, but not as stiff as a natural loofah brush I have.&lt;br /&gt;✅ Stiff curved handle: stiff handle does not flex, goes exactly where I want it to go.  Curved shape makes it easy for me to reach the back.&lt;br /&gt;✅ A loop on the handle allows me to hang it on the bathroom caddy so it drips right into the tub while it dries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total length of the brush is 14\\&quot;. The length of the handle is 10\\&quot;. The size of the head is 3.5\\&quot; x 2.5\\&quot;. The height of the bristles is 7/8\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In attached video I show several close-ups of the brush. I also run my fingers through the brisles to give you a better idea of their stiffness.  I really like this brush!  My favorite feature of this brush is a stiff curved handle which makes it easy to wash the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review&lt;br /&gt;[sample provided for review]</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter. She needed a stiffer brush. Feels too stiff when dry but once wet, she loves it!</li>
    <li> My brush with greatness.  A great brush.</li>
    <li> This brush does the job.  Wonderful for getting the hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> This brush is terrific. Yes , I would recommend to others.  It firm but soft, it&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, but Long Handle....not so much. My fault for not reading the dimensions that were listed, but never the less this is not a long handled brush. At least not in my mind. I&#x27;m six foot and find it hard to get my entire back without some effort which is why I bought a back brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also not a Medium Soft Bristled brush either. It is pretty stiff in my mind. It might soften over time, at least I hope so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might not be fair to only give it three stars, but it specifically states \\&quot;Long Handle\\&quot; and \\&quot;Medium Soft Bristles\\&quot;, neither of which are accurate statements. I&#x27;ll keep it but be looking for one that is really long handled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a medium handled stiff brush, this one will serve that purpose well.</li>
    <li> I brought this body brush to replace my old wooden one which cracked after only a couple of months, since this brush comes with a one year guarantee. So far I am very pleased with the feel and quality of the brush and the best part about it is that I can use it for my dry skin brushing routine as well as in the shower or bath afterwards. It is very easy to wash the soap of when I&#x27;ve finished and it just hangs up to dry. I also found the eBook about skin brushing very useful as it gave good diagrams and instructions for skin brushing.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical of dry brushing when I first found this product.  I do not like to feel that my skin is being peeled off of my body and that is what came to my mind when I thought of dry brushing.  However, after using this brush my skin feels amazingly soft and enlivened after using this.  I look forward to making this a part of my daily routine.  It is a very good price and the shipping time was fantastic.  I would highly recommend this product if you have ever wanted to try dry brushing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several back brushes in the past and this one is far superior. The bristles are just right -- not too soft, not too hard. The handle is the proper length and angle.</li>
    <li> It is a bath brush, how much can you say about a bath brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived promptly, kind of a big box but to accomodate its length the box was equally as wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle length is good and should be sufficient for the tallest people with the shortest arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The individual bristles are soft but with the number of bristles the overall effect is stiff. Not really hard, no danger of scratching yourself but they don&#x27;t &#x27;give&#x27; a lot. For me this is perfect as I desired a stiff rub with the soaping. But it may be a bit more than some people want. It says putting the bristles in a stream of warm water immediately before use will soften them and it does a little but just due to the number of bristles they still are stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet read the ebook about dry brushing and its health benefits, as this was of no interest to me. I merely wanted a bath brush to clean/massage my back during my daily shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price it is a very good bath brush and if you are looking for use as a dry brush and the ebook then that is just a bonus.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect back brush for me.  Others are saying it&#x27;s too short, but I prefer this.  I have a stall shower, which I hate so much, because it&#x27;s difficult for a grown person to be comfortable enough in it to take a shower.  The stall shower also has a big seat molded into it, making the available shower space even smaller.  Well anyway, my old shower brush would hit the walls of the shower every time I&#x27;d use it, and my husband would come running into the bathroom asking if I was okay.  Stupid shower!  Well, this little pink back brush made taking a shower in a cramped space much better.  It doesn&#x27;t hit the walls when I scrub my back.  I might hate my shower, but I love this little back brush.</li>
    <li> The handle is the perfect size for me to reach my entire back without stretching. The brush is just firm enough to clean without taking the first layer of skin off!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I suppose I really don&#x27;t want to be exfoliated as much as I want to be sudsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t get any sudsing when I pour shower gel on the brush, as I can do with all the other shower brushes. And the head is very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer a different sort of head entirely, something that looks more like a ball of thin nylon rags attached to the handle. The edges of the rags are sharp and stiff, and they do the exfoliating and also suds up so I can easily spread the soap around my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using one like that but it started to get full of mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving your brush I decided to run some mildew remover thoroughly over the head, and now it looks and smells good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to disappoint but it&#x27;s honest.</li>
    <li> Bath brush is very nicely made. I just wish it was a little longer. I broke my right humorous and can not reach with that arm that well, otherwise I am satisfied with this brush.</li>
    <li> I finally bought a back brush after struggling in the shower due to a shoulder injury. This brush was everything I needed. It is easy to grip while wet  and has a long enough handle to really cover my back. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t completely taken with was that the bristles were a little hard for me, although they may just take some getting used to and may soften with time. Overall, I am satisfied and will continue to use this brush. I received this item at a discount in return for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I use this brush in two ways. I dry brush in the mornings and love the results I&#x27;m seeing from that. In addition, I love to use it in the shower after workouts to really get my back clean and all the yucky sweat off. It works so well!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moT50WXDRVDI6H]]&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a hot and nice looking pink color with see thoroughness too it I used it already several times to soap my body up with my Favorite Shea butter body wash , but you&#x27;ll can use any kind of wash or even a bar of soap , their wasn&#x27;t any shedding which means it&#x27;s a very (high quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;body brush ).

    <li> I love this brush.  It works equally well for dry brushing and in the shower.  The handle is easy to grip and the right lingth</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; soft, had others&amp; didnt like them on my skin.this was much better.ive told lots of people about this.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d find myself writing a review about a bath brush but after using it I changed my mind.  I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to get out your favorite natural body wash or yummy coconut soap and start lathering up your back with this pretty brush.  The bristles on this are firm, and I scrubbed hard, but if you have sensitive skin, you may want to brush lighter.  My back tingled afterwards and felt like it was getting a good exfoliation too.  My boyfriend said my back felt smooth and he loves rubbing it (win win!).  It is very pretty (looks great sitting on my tub next to my plants), solid quality, and was packaged really nice.  My boyfriend surprised me after eyeballing the PINK brush saying he was looking forward to using it too, so made me extra glad I got it.  Would make a great addition to a gift basket full of luscious bath products for a loved one or for your special lady.</li>
    <li> Needed a back brush to replace my very old, cracked, and worn one. Found this on Amazon and the price and description were exactly what I was looking for. The length is just right, easy to maneuver without becoming a contortionist. The bristles are not too rough and not too wimpy. I did find that if the bathroom was cold in the morning the bristles were a bit more stiff and by holding it under the shower spray for a few moments warmed them up and the stiffness eased up. Customer service was exemplary as was the packaging and shipping speed. Pink is not a manly color but since no one other than my wife is going to see me using a pink brush, the color doesn&#x27;t really matter. Overall very pleased with this purchase. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of times to replace my old one with brushes from Walmart and Target and one was like a deck brush and the other one was way too soft. This one is right in the middle.</li>
    <li> good but don&#x27;t have an option of colors</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this bath brush.&lt;br /&gt;After only 60 days of use (one shower a day, on average), bristles are falling out, and the the bristles at the handle end of the brush are a matted and tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;After getting 3 years of use out of a less expensive brush, I had hoped for a couple of years of use from this one.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the return and replacement period for this brush was only 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and they instantly refunded my purchase in full.&lt;br /&gt;While I was not happy with the brush, I am pleased with the customer service from TopNotch US!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to give dry brushing a try, so I picked up one of these. First, the length of the handle is good. I can reach every part of my back without any issue, but it also makes reaching my legs and the ends of my arms very easy. I&#x27;d read with dry brushing you need firm, but not uncomfortable bristles and I think this fits that bill perfectly. The bristles are firm enough that I&#x27;m getting a good brushing/exfoliating in, but not so firm that I feel in pain after using it. I am able to do the dry brushing with a good amount of force and don&#x27;t find my skin to be sensitive afterwards. The plastic seems very high quality and like it will withstand my clumsy hands dropping it from time to time. The bristles are very firmly attached and it doesn&#x27;t look like they run a risk of coming off (an issue I&#x27;ve had in the past). Overall, this is a quality product and if you are looking to give dry brushing a try, think this brush fills the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a body brush for the shower. I have used a fuller brush for many years.  When I tried to purchase a new one of the same type, alas, it was no longer in their inventory. I have been searching for something of the equivalent size and shape and this was as close as I could find. I am very pleased with this brush. If the bristles had been denser I would have given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved handle on this brush makes it easy to reach every part of my back.  Since the brush does not flex, you can use as much or little pressure as desired.  I love the fact that the bristles are firm enough it can be used to exfoliate and for cellulite massaging. I recommend you use it for your at home pedicures.  Bristles may be softened before use, just run them under water for about 30 seconds.  To clean the brush, rinse with cold water and hang to dry by the provided loop.  Remember to download the free ebook guide on dry skin brushing.</li>
    <li> I like things just right. :-) This Top Notch brush is not too long or short, not too stiff or too soft, has a handy curved handle, is a great price, and is beautiful!  See? Just right.</li>
    <li> Way too soft for my liking. Maybe I should have got another color...</li>
    <li> I must say I like this shower brush a lot the bristles are just fine for me.  The others I&#x27;ve used are very soft and don&#x27;t really scrub like this one does.  I&#x27;m a guy and pink really isn&#x27;t my favorite but the quality and stiffer bristles make up for it.  If I had to give a negative it would be, for me, a little bit longer handle to get further down my back.  Good quality product and good follow up from the seller.</li>
    <li> Works well, and the quality seems good.</li>
    <li> Wish the handle was longer and the bristles a little more firm, but it works.</li>
    <li> Many back brushes on the market are too soft bristled to exfoliate sufficiently. The item description given mentioned both &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; which led me to think this may be just the kind I was seeking! One tip on the brush&#x27;s tag suggested to use warm water to soften the bristles. I do NOT want soft bristles for my extremely dry skin. Therefore, I placed a hook in the corner of the shower to keep the brush dry until I use it. I LOVE this brush. It does a great job of exfoliating! Never thought I could be this pleased with just a back brush! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It feels great on my skin (kind of like getting a nice back scratch) and is very sturdy.  I love that it is plastic as I feel that it is easier to clean than some of the wood brushes I&#x27;ve seen.  Comes with a nice hanger which is perfect for hanging up in the shower.  Great product!</li>
    <li> this is great on my feet. I cannot stand it against my back, it is far too rough for that, but it works wonderfully on my feet, which I will continue to use it for. It&#x27;s a great product, so I do not want to discredit how useful it is, but it is just far too rough for tender areas.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this brush. Bristles are too stiff, I could scrub the shower stall with them  :(  I don&#x27;t like the super soft brushes because they feel like they don&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;d like something either in-between the normally too soft brushes and this too stiff brush for my body except it&#x27;s okay for my feet. A little uncomfortable, but doable.  One thing I don&#x27;t like about this hard brush is that I can&#x27;t get shower gel/ liquid soap to cling to the bristles to wash my back :(  or my feet!  Although I did read the description of the brush being 14&amp;#34;, it turns out to be too short for me.  That&#x27;s not a complaint about this item because I knew the length when I bought it, I&#x27;m just mentioning it.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 8&amp;#34; and I need a longer handle to reach the middle of my back. This</li>
    <li> handle too short...bristles tough</li>
    <li> Great product. Very exfoliating. Fast delivery. Wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> As a mother of seven children, my skin has been through quite the ordeal.  After every baby, I rely on dry skin brushing to help restore the elasticity of my skin and reduce the floppy look that pregnancy causes.  As you can imagine, I have been through MANY brushes.  After using this one for a while, I think it is shaping up to be the best one yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used plastic brushes and wooden ones.  Being a quasi-crunchy mama, I&#x27;d like to say that the all natural ones are better, but the bristles just do not stand up to the torture I put them through.  I&#x27;ve had a couple other plastic ones, and they always feel cheap.  I&#x27;ve broken the handle off of one.  The other met its demise at the hands of my then three year old son.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one feels sturdy, more substantial.  It feel like it may be the longest living brush so far.  :D  I&#x27;ll edit my review if that changes!</li>
    <li> Bristles could be a little stiffer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various bath brushes, a couple a year, for several years, and never found the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; one.  Most of the time, the bristles are just too soft to do much.  I was beginning to think that no one made a brush with stiffer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a sample from the manufacturer to try out, and provide an honest review.  I can honestly say, I really LOVE this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are just stiff enough -- not too abrasive, but stiff enough to feel like they&#x27;re really DOING something.  The handle length is just fine for me, too -- I&#x27;m tall-ish (about 5&#x27;8&amp;#34;), and I can reach what needs to be reached with no problem.  The handle is textures so that it doesn&#x27;t slip in soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this enough that I&#x27;m planning to purchase another one for my guest bathroom, and possibly one more to pack for trips.  It&#x27;s really that good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too hard and it hurts me. It feels like I&#x27;m scrubbing my body with a stainless steel scouring pad. I tried letting it sit in hot water, but it didn&#x27;t soften. I thought it would soften over time with use, but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m now typing this review, my body stinging from an earlier shower with this scrub. It feels like I have scratches all over! Too many of my skin cells were forcefully removed with this and now my skin feels raw; and I barely touched my skin with this scrub since it was so darn uncomfortable! My family members tried it, and they had the same reaction: \\&quot;ouch!\\&quot; Then again, everyone who tried it is either 22 years old or younger, so our skin is young and sensitive to harsh scrubs like this. I can see it being used to scrub your calloused feet, though. My grandma loves using it for that.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Quick shipping.  Quality product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always seen these in the store, but always thought to myself that it would be too hard on my skin.  I decided to give this one a try and I am so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this brush is that there are multiple uses for it.  You can-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You can use this for hard to reach places such as your back, back of legs, etc.  The bristles are really soft that I did not have a problem with irritation, in fact it felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  My favorite use, is for the bottom of my feet.  It is very hard to find something that will give the bottom of your feet a good scrub.  I am a sandal wearer by religion, so it is important I am able to adequately get my feet super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Perhaps my favorite use once I am able to work on it.  Dr. Oz said that this is the best treatment for leg cellulitis (look it up).  He recommends that daily you can use this brush (dry) and in an upward motion on the back of your thigh, keep rubbing the brush starting from the knee up to the thigh, in repetition.  Overtime, that should move and break up the cellulite that has built up there.  I am excited to try this and will be taking before and after photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very well made and super easy to clean.  The bristles are far enough apart to get the soap out of there, but close enough together to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Bristles aren&#x27;t too soft and not too hard .. just right for me. Not to hard to hold onto in the shower. I&#x27;m fat so this helps out a lot washing places that are harder to reach .. like my little piggy toe.</li>
    <li> Though the brush works well, the handle could be a little longer.</li>
    <li> After my doctor told me that my itchy back might be remedied by using a back brush while showering I bought this brush. It relieved the itching and it feels good on my back.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It is exactly what I wanted and it is very sturdy.  I use it in the shower and I have also used it for dry brushing.....works well either way.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review on a bath brush, but this brush is the best. I love the long, STURDY handle that makes it easy foe back scrubbing. And I&#x27;ve had no problem with bristles falling out. I have dry, itchy skin and love the relief I get with this brush - from soothing the itch to sloughing the dry skin. A very good quality brush.</li>
    <li> nice brush soft and the handle is the p[roper length. Thank you</li>
    <li> I like it, though would like it to be a little softer.</li>
    <li> First bath brush that I have owned. I love it! The handle is long and is ribbed so that when you are scrubbing it will not slip out of your hands, and you can reach all of your back. It has nice bristles and really leaves you feeling invigorated. You can feel the tingle in your skin. It was heavenly on my feet! It is also easy to hang up in the shower. It comes with an ebook about dry brushing that I have not yet read but plan to soon!</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a back brush that reaches  my back.  Does the job my wife won&#x27;t</li>
    <li> What can I say, it is a bath brush. It arrived in a timely manner, was overpackaged. It does the job.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this brush - my husband was forever calling me into the bathroom to wash his back for him (Yep) so hello, personal back scrubber!  I love that he can use the loop to hang it up on the shower organizer instead of laying it down on the shower floor and getting moldy/mildewy. Unlike my husband, I&#x27;m a washcloth user but I&#x27;ve tried it out myself a couple of times and it&#x27;s soft enough to be comfortable yet you can feel the scrub and know that the bristles are doing their job. I foresee us having this brush for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> Bought the brush based on the many positive reviews and thus far I am very pleased.  I have used just 2 times but felt an immediate difference on my skin after the first use and even better after the second use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t put my finger on what exactly one thing that is bothersome about this brush. There are a few . The angle of the brush head is very awkward and tends to stick up when attempting to scrub the back.  Either the handle needs to be a bit longer or the brush head a lot bigger to get to mid back,  While the bristles are very very hard It does fine on the feet. .</li>
    <li> Very good quality brush but has one glaring problem, for me, in that the handle is too short. The handle may be adequate for the distaff side, but a man&#x27;s requirement for body reach is different, unless he has arms like a gorilla. I will look for a body brush that has a longer handle.</li>
    <li> Love, love the feel of this brush for lathering/scrubbing in the shower and for dry exfoliation. I just wish the head were larger and the handle at least 4 inches longer. The handle is curved making it shorter than the dimensions would indicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other color choices would be nice, but overall, I am very pleased with this bath brush.</li>
    <li> This brush gets to where I can&#x27;t. My back feels much better after only a few uses. I use it dry to remove the dead skin. I have had a problem with my back itching for years and this brush helps immensely.</li>
    <li> I gave this item to my granddaughter for her birthday and she loves it.  She&#x27;s wanted one for a long time.</li>
    <li> I looked at an almost identical looking pink, ribbed handled bath brush at the .99 cents store recently, but I did not purchase it because the bristles seemed much too soft.  Other reviewers of this brush said that the bristles on it are fairly firm, so I ordered it.  After it was delivered, I took it to the .99 cents store to compare the brushes side by side.  Although the brush at the .99 cent store looked almost identical to this one, it was not the same quality.  It was a slightly thiner plastic and did not feel as sturdy as this one.  This brush is much more nicely made.  I have used it several times now, and the bristles are indeed firm.  If one desires softer bristles, one is instructed to run warm water over them before using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one to two uses a day, I estimate that this brush could easily last a year, maybe a good bit longer, and because it seems well made and arrived quickly after I ordered it, I am quite pleased with the purchase.  I LOVE the colour, too.  It matches my bathroom decor perfectly!  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, bristles could be a little courser/</li>
    <li> This brush is so rough, by back actually stings when I go to rinse the soap off.  I imagine tiny little abrasion marks all over my skin.  The handle is also too short for me.  It will stay in the shower though.  I will use it to scrub the walls on cleaning day.  It is seriously that rough.  Oh, and if you buy this from TopNotchUSA, expect to be inundated with emails about ever other day.  I finally clicked on one of these damned emails only to realize I actually have to unsubscribe them.  I&#x27;m a little ticked off with Amazon for allowing their merchants to use this type of marketing.  I unsubscribed, so hopefully that will be the end of it.  I sure as hell will not be buying any more of these dreadful brushes.</li>
    <li> This bath brush is exactly what I hoped it would be. It is just the right shape and stiffness for scrubbing my back, which I can no longer reach now that I am getting older. The handle is just the right length. I also find that it makes cleaning my feet easier during my shower. As a bonus, this brush sure makes it easy if I need to scratch my back, even when I&#x27;m not showering, and there have been times when I used it just for that. Also I thought that such a good brush was a bargain at $10.99. I have had it for about two months and so far it seems sturdy and hasn&#x27;t changed at all since I first used it. I rinse it off to remove any soap after each use, and then hang it to dry. Buy this brush and you won&#x27;t be sorry. Five stars all the way.</li>
    <li> This brush is long handled, which makes it easy for me to reach my feet or back while in the shower.  I like that it has two options to hang it in my shower to dry, either by the cord or directly by the handle.  I prefer using it on my feet as the exfoliation is a bit intense for my skin.  The long handle and ridges make it easy to grip securely in the shower.</li>
    <li> 74 yr male, arthritis, pot belly, etc., would give 5 stars if 6&amp;#34; longer. I believe I was able to reach &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; parts of my back, but it was done with considerable pain and discomfort. This problem will probably not affect 95%-99% of users, as it is very specific to being moderately obese, and afflicted with joint and muscle pain. The brush (imo) is a very good balance between softness and stiffness. I actually use the brush nearly full body and not just on the back.</li>
    <li> Loved it so much I bought another as a gift!</li>
    <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon that got amazing reviews and I hate the product. For one simple reason... when I use it in the shower I feel like my skin is on fire after lightly scrubbing. It&#x27;s too hard. I bought this after I visited my mom and she had a boar&#x27;s brush in a similar design. I could use that one the entire shower and feel clean, this one just hurts. Some reviews said it was too soft, and this leads me to believe the product is not consistent in it&#x27;s manufacturing. Either that, or Amazon has Rhino&#x27;s using this thing. I&#x27;ve since purchased a German made wood/boar bristle one.</li>
    <li> I am so IN LOVE with this brush! I especially love the LONG handle that makes it easy to reach my entire back two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I have come to the conclusion that as I age I am not longer able to reach some of the nooks and crannies that I once did. Enter the bath brush. I have a shoulder injury that limits the area that I can cover when taking my shower. This brush lathers nice and provides just the right amount of extension needed to cover my back. I like this unit in particular because it is light weight and just the perfect reach without seeming bulky. I wish it came in more colors! I would get a different color for everyone in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I found another color. I am not sure how I missed it. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H3MATM2?psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> Good enough. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and I feel like this brush was just 3/4&amp;#34; or 1&amp;#34; too short. I can use it though.</li>
    <li> The handle is not long enough for us, and bristles are not as firm as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Brush is very nice. Handle is just right for reaching the back areas. Rinses clean after use. I really enjoy my bath brush an would recommend it for anyone</li>
    <li> Nice long handle and good bristles. Gets the job done. We really like it.</li>
    <li> My Keratosis Pilaris or &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; is gone. This brush is a little rough so I use it every other 3 days.</li>
    <li> I needed a good body brush that would allow me to reach all parts of my back for my 4 minute dry brushing technique that I do each morning before my shower. By the way, dry brushing is the fastest, easiest, most effective way to get rid of cellulite besides all of its other important benefits.  See the You Tube video &amp;#34;The Correct Way to Dry Brush&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This brush is not only great for hard to reach areas, it works wonders on my feet. I scrub my feet with it in the shower every night and it leaves them feeling soft and smooth. Just what I needed after wearing heels to work every day! My husband even steals it and uses it for himself. May have to purchase him one as well. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying this as it does a good job of scrubbing back and legs. I use it daily in the shower and will continue to due so.</li>
    <li> I adore a good bath brush. It exfoliates, scrubs, and even helps soothe/massage aches and pains (I have Fibro and Ehlers Danlos). This one is sturdy and pink and just the right length. Also great for back scratching. :)</li>
    <li> got it in one piece  the packaging was torn up</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get used to the feel of the brush, but it does a great job. I am six foot and don&#x27;t have any issues with the length of the handle.</li>
    <li> Great brush for price!</li>
    <li> Too short, and the bristles are painfully sharp.  Hey, I try to be manly but the damn things are like needles.  As for the length--well, I suspect many of us buy this because we&#x27;re not all that flexible, right?  I&#x27;m of average height, and I have to work to get to the middle of my back.  And once I do, well, the angle is wrong and only the edge of the brush is touching.  I can&#x27;t understand why people like this--I think it&#x27;s the worst back brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Would have cost me five bucks to return it, so I&#x27;m keeping it as my new toilet brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to replace a yerba prima skin brush that I was using to clean my back. Well, this brush is equally as stiff. In fact, i&#x27;s so stiff you can&#x27;t even get liquid soap to lather on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a brush to clean your back, this is not it. If you are looking for a brush to leave scratches on your back, this is it.</li>
    <li> Besides it being pink, it needs to be curved toward the end of the brush.  The other bath brushes I have bought in the past had a curve toward the bristles which makes it contour to the back much better.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is very good if you like a stiff bristled brush.</li>
    <li> Rub a dubb dubb.  Its a nice brush.</li>
    <li> Good enough for the price. Can be used to give a sound spanking too.</li>
    <li> It is painful when you use it!</li>
    <li> AWESOME BRUSH....WORKS GREAT IN THE SHOWER FOR WASHING MY BACK SIDE....COULD BE A LITTLE LONGER..BUT NOT A DEAL BREAKER... BRUSH IS A BIT STIFF AT FIRST ...HOPING IT WILL SOFTEN UP.LIKE A TOOTH BRUSH.......WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Perfect for the shower, nice long handle to reach everywhere needed. The brush is a very nice bristle - not too hard or too soft. I like that it has a plastic handle, as opposed to the wooden ones which tend to crack and mildew after prolonged use.</li>
    <li> Well made, sturdy bath brush. I like the curved handle and the grooves at the top of the handle to keep it from slipping. I find that the bristles are soft, yet firm. The brush is long enough for me to reach those not easy to reach spots, but my 6&#x27;2&#x27;&#x27; husband found it a little short for him. But that&#x27;s okay, because it&#x27;s mine! :) It&#x27;s lighter weight than I thought it would be, but still feels sturdy. It looks like it will be easy to keep clean compared to similar products. Love the pink color!</li>
    <li> Great brush.  A tad stiff for my taste but I&#x27;m sure it will soften with use.</li>
    <li> good quality durable and easy to clean !</li>
    <li> Firm but not to the point of damaging my sensitive skin. Great for back, feet.</li>
    <li> Not quite what it says it it.  Hard to hold on to handle if you have a little soap on your hand.  Too short.  But yes, the bristles are harder then most, and I do like that.</li>
    <li> The brushes are deadly.  If you want a seriously rough brush, with stiff bristles, this the the brush for you.  I have only used mine once, so maybe after a few washes it might soften up.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is fairly short, so you have to be limber to reach your back, or small</li>
    <li> I got this brush for my mother, who is in her late 60s. She is having a problem reaching places and she asked for a back brush. This one is great, its not too soft not too hard, moderate enough bristles to use on a dry back. The really cool thing is that the handle is slightly curved to make it easier to reach your back by minimizing the stretch of your arm to reach your back. Has a convenient loop on the handle so you can hang it. I advise letting it dry out between uses to increase the longevity of the brush/bristles.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how effective this simple brush is! I can only liken it to having a spa attendant bathe you. And it looks really good. I plan on ordering more to use as gifts.</li>
    <li> The bath brush is exactly as described, well constructed and made of high quality materials. As others have commented, the brush features rather firm bristles, which is exactly what I was looking for when selecting a bath brush.</li>
    <li> I love this back brush. I do wish the handle was two inches longer but if it were maybe it would break easily. I am able to wash my back and reach under my arms to wash my lower back. The bristles are strong but not to strong that they scratch your skin. It feels like your back is getting a good washing. There are comments here that the bristles are to weak. The person that posted this comment must have alligator skin because If the bristles were any stronger it would leave scratch marks on your skin.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and super fast delivery time</li>
    <li> Nice item, just wish handle was longer.</li>
    <li> great brush for my back!</li>
    <li> great product- nice curve to the handle, nice mid level stiffness to the bristles- I later bought a second brush as a gift!!</li>
    <li> I like this brush. Some people have said that this brush is too soft. I don&#x27;t think so! Now, I am may have sensitive skin (it&#x27;s possible), but those who think it is too soft must have the hide of a rhinoceros (possibly possible? smile).</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say that I have never been so disappointed in a product as I have experienced with this one. After reading all the wonderful reviews I thought I had found what I was looking for in a simple bath brush since they seem to be so hard to find in the stores these days. What I found was a brush handle that was way too short for me to use with ease and bristles that are so hard it actually hurt my back when I used it. Personally and in my own opinion the bristles are so hard and uncomfortable on my skin that rather then throwing out money by throwing it out I can and will probably use this bath brush on my kitchen floor to clean my grout somehow.</li>
    <li> If this is as durable as the last one I will be happy.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Poorly designed handle does not sit comfortably in the hand at all brushing angles. When grabbing this with my natural grip, the brush is turned at an odd angle for brushing the back. To brush effectively, I have to re-position the handle in my hand to where it is not a natural or comfortable grip. And it&#x27;s very slippery with soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The handle is too short, at least for me (I am 6&#x27; tall).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The bristles are a bit too hard for me. Of the many brushes we have owned, this is the hardest. This may be a good thing for those wanting hard bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Over-priced for what you get. This brush is basically a heavy duty version of what one might find at a dollar store.</li>
    <li> Durable and still if you like deep exfoliation. Personally, I should have gotten a softer brush.</li>
    <li> I am returning the brush.  It was not at all what the description indicated.  The bristles were soft, not stiff.  I recently had purchased a similar brush at a local store (1/2 the price of the Top Notch brush), with the same soft bristles.  The brush does not have any exfoliation qualities to it at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hard to grip with wet, soapy hands, and the angle of the bend in the handle is odd. The brush part doesn&#x27;t lie flat against your back as you are holding it. I prefer a natural bristle brush that I have for its shape and curve of the handle.</li>
    <li> My family has had a long series of back scrubbers over the years - loofahs, mitts, puffs, and even a few brushes.  Most of them either didn&#x27;t reach all the parts that needed washing, or they were too soft or too scratchy.  I had a natural bristle brush once that took the skin off and then molded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is just about perfect. It has a plastic handle with well-attached plastic bristles, so it can be bleached or scalded to keep it sanitary.  The bristles are stiff enough to give an invigorating scrub without damaging my skin.  It has a loop of cord to hang it conveniently in the shower between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it dry as directed, and was amazed and a little embarrassed by all the dead skin that came off on my legs!  I&#x27;m not convinced that massaging with a brush will do anything about cellulite, but time will tell and I will update this review if I notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about the product is the price, which seems high for a back brush.  I received a complimentary brush for the purpose of testing and review.</li>
    <li> All the bath brushes I&#x27;ve purchased through the years have been too soft for me.  Ever in search for a firmer brush, I finally stopped wasting money on bath brushes  because I thought they must all be too soft.  I was asked to provide an honest review for the TopNotch Body Brush - Quality Bath Brush &amp; was delighted to have finally found a brush with medium bristles. Perfect for me. The bristles don&#x27;t squish together when I&#x27;m trying to wash my back, but stay firm enough to do a great job cleaning my back &amp; provide an invigorating tingle too. The brush measures about 14\\&quot; from end to end &amp; is long enough for me to reach all parts of my back. The handle has ridges so it&#x27;s easy to hold when wet. The brush is see-thru,  medium  pink &amp; has a nylon hanging loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious about the free Dry Brushing eBook offer so I checked it out &amp; am going to try it. According to the eBook, \\&quot;dry skin brushing is a traditional way of massaging the body that stimulates &amp; refreshes the lymphatic system &amp; the skin.\\&quot; There are many benefits of dry brushing, among them are: improvement in skin texture, cleansing the lymphatic system, rejuvenated cells, muscle toning &amp; more. According to ayurvedic medicine the whole body will function &amp; feel much better when  dry skin brushing is done properly &amp; regularly.  I suggest you take time to check out the eBook. You might want to give dry skin brushing a try.  It feels great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year guarantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
    <li> I like good exfoliation, and this brush is the best one that I&#x27;ve tried for feeling really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are perfect, they aren&#x27;t scratchy, just firm enough to provide a good scrub, they do soften just a bit in hot water, but not too soft. The length works well for me, and the brush size is just right. The handle is sturdy enough that even with firm use it hasn&#x27;t snapped. That&#x27;s been an issue in the past. It&#x27;s ridged in just the right place to keep it gripped with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer, and my back feels really clean using this brush. The color is great too, the bright pretty pink is very happy looking.&lt;br /&gt;[The product reviewed was provided to me at no cost for the purposes of review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product.]</li>
    <li> Never used a body brush. But I must say I have been missing out. This thing is sooooo great with a lathering soap. Long too for my back, had trouble washing my back without this. Too perfect this body brush. Plus it is pink as a bonus!</li>
    <li> I like the brush.  It isn&#x27;t too hard or soft.  The handle could be a little longer, but that would be my only comment.  It was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Finally found a bath brush that didn&#x27;t feel like it was scraping skin off.  It&#x27;s firm, but doesn&#x27;t scratch.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> The brush handle is sturdy and the brush bristle is firm enough but the length of the brush is not long, needs to be 3&amp;#34; to 4&#x27;&#x27; longer. I am 6&#x27; 1&amp;#34; tall and cannot reach the center of my back with the brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got lovely, stiff bristles that make the  back feel properly scrubbed. If the handle were longer it would be perfect, but really it should be called &amp;#34;medium handled&amp;#34;. Very hard to reach the center of my back with it; my arms just aren&#x27;t long enough.</li>
    <li> Nice brush  Sturdy.  Bristles are pretty stiff.</li>
    <li> The description states that the brush has a long handle, but in fact it is only 14&amp;#34; long!  I can not easily reach where I need to, especially since the brush constantly slips out of my hand when I use it in the shower, even though I rinse the soap off my hand before picking it up.  What is especially annoying is that the brush in not returnable.  Therefore, I am stuck with a grossly inferior brush until I decide to replace it with a decent model.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help with the rough skin I have developed on my back after chemo treatment, but after two showers all I have to show for it is a very red back. I have rough skin patches that are easily scratched off with my nails but that I find irritating and had hoped this brush would help wash them off or prevent them from developing, but nothing has changed. It did, however, do a fabulous job on my feet with just one wash. My feet are already smoother, and after my shower I almost felt like foot lotion was overkill!</li>
    <li> What a lovely brush of the highest quality. Real value for money and I&#x27;m finding myself using it daily! I was disappointed after my wooden brush cracked and broke so searched out for an alternative and I&#x27;m dead pleased with this one! Quick delivery and arrived in great condition, would recommend!</li>
    <li> Good brush so far. Brush made of plastic. Be careful I can see it breaking if dropped. Would be better if made of wood or rubber.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush among all my brush family. First is because the brittles are soft enough to caress my skin and keep it moisturize but stiff enough to take off all the dirt at my back. The handle is long enough to reach all the parts of my body which I can&#x27;t reach and it doesn&#x27;t slip even though my hand is filled with soap or shampoo. It is very convenient to use. The brittles are not too close to each other too and that makes it easier to clean. I think it is the best shower brush you could ever have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Way too coarse and bristly. The handle is also too short.  Not long as advertised.</li>
    <li> this is a perfect bath brush.  the length is perfect.  The plastic handle &amp; bristles clean well &amp; stay dry between uses.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Yes it exfoliates my skin so it is a little ruff but that is what we wanted</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT---HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> Bristles are way, way too stiff. I have sensitive skin everywhere, but my back is definitely the least sensitive, and this still  left my skin really agitated.</li>
    <li> I had a wooden handle brush and of course it got spunky and cracked pretty quickly.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  The brush is the right firmness for me.  Recommend</li>
    <li> I am used to using a loofah on a handle and this brush does not give the same feeling of resistance and coverage of my old brush.  The reason i switched is because the loofah kept falling off the handle.  I doubt that will ever be a problem with this brush.</li>
    <li> It is OK.  I wish the handle was a bit longer and the head larger and softer.  I use it in the shower and because of the stiff bristles it does not suds up a lot.  I am still looking for one like my previous scrubber.  The handle was longer and instead of a brush it had a plastic mesh scrungy head that held the lather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TopNotch brush does well asa back scratcher and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This brush works well and its just the right size, sturdy, and durable.  Not sure if it&lt;br /&gt;comes in other colors, this pink is nice.</li>
    <li> The handle is too short. The bristles are too hard. (You can hold it under warm water for 30 minutes and it won&#x27;t soften up). If I didn&#x27;t use it for two days I would have returned it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BTW, I went to Walmart today and bought 2 soft bristle, long handle AND detachable brush for less than the price of this one!</li>
    <li> great product. great price. fast service</li>
    <li> Bought several. Given with gift bags. Everyone loved them.</li>
    <li> Yikes its harsh! I am not even all that sensitive and this is too much.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever used a bush for my back in the shower, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. The quality of the brush looks impressive. But there is a design flaw. The handle needs to be slip resistant. I found using the brush with soap almost unusable in the shower. I will solve this problem with friction tape, however. I wonder if the designer of this bush actually used his product. My advice: Stay away from this brush.</li>
    <li> It looks like a cheapo shower brush, and that&#x27;s basically what it is. Does the job just fine. Bristles are too harsh for most of my body, but then very comfortable on my feet. Overall, good to have around, nothing earth shattering.</li>
    <li> This brush does exactly what I need in one. My Daughter is handicapped &amp; For the last 3 months we had to change her shower &amp; I have to get in behind her to help her get a bath. Now I don&#x27;t have to stand on my head to help Her wash. Thanks, Lee</li>
    <li> Feels very good on the back and feet.</li>
    <li> Good brush.  It won&#x27;t rot like wood bath brushes.</li>
    <li> Nice brush at a nice price. The bristles are firm, but comfortable. So happy to find one that is not soft. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this brush and the way it assist your shower or bath.  Nice Scrubber with soft bristles and long handle.</li>
    <li> If u like hard brush than it for u I like it</li>
    <li> This is strictly a sloughing brush, not a back wash brush at all.  I prefer the bristle brush to this brush anyway.</li>
    <li> When I first got this item my first thought was that the handle was too short, but after trying it I found it to be the perfect length for a women or even a child.  My husband tried it and it was too short and a little awkward for him. So ladies , this is the perfect size for you!!&lt;br /&gt;I loved the one piece construction and the brush is not too coarse.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for exfoliation!  Put your favorite yummy shower gel on there, rub in small circles, and exfoliate away!  Your skin will feel amazing!  I love the long handle for reaching your back (I already have a loofah w/ a long handle for daily purposes, but I love the feeling of exfoliating my back too).  There is a loop at the end, so it can be hung on your bath caddy, out of the way, to dry and be ready for it&#x27;s next use.  The pink adds a touch of color and fun to the shower too.  :)</li>
    <li> I only recently heard about dry brushing and wanted to give it a try. I was very happy to find a brush that actually came with a dry brushing guide. For dry brushing it works great. Easy to reach and with light strokes it feels like it&#x27;s doing what it should be to help. The guide was very clear and helpful. In the shower it is great for reaching my back and scrubbing my feet. I haven&#x27;t had it long and the bristles are still pretty stiff so it&#x27;s not quite something I can use for overall washing, but I think it will get there with more use. My husband immediately stole it and said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s pink, that thing is awesome.&amp;#34;  Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way, nor promised any future promotions. I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
    <li> I love this body brush and would recommend it to anyone.  It was received promptly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Fairly well made but handle is to short to reach all areas of your back. Next time I&#x27;ll be looking one for a longer handle and stiffer bristles.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this brush for about two weeks now. The bristles are not soft, but they aren&#x27;t too stiff either. It&#x27;s amazing to see the grime and dirt that this brush gets off your body at the end of the day. As gross as it may sound, but to see that being washed off your body gives you an extra clean feeling. You won&#x27;t get this kind of clean with just a wash cloth. Also, my skin is amazingly soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it with African black soap and the combo works like magic! The handle is long enough and has ridges for a good grip even when wet. Worth the money. Will repurchase as necessary.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush.  It came with some of the bristles bent by the packaging, but once the brush sat for a day or so, the bristles popped backed up.  The company was kind enough to contact me to offer a replacement, but it&#x27;s fine now, and I do appreciate a company that pays attention to their customers, and reaches out as they did.  The bristles are just the right firmness I was looking for, it fits nicely in my hand, and is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for in a dry brush. Not too expensive, but sturdy and does the job!</li>
    <li> I like it well enough, but it slips in my hand.  I guess I can wrap the handle with a few rubber bands</li>
    <li> I love this brush. The bristles are stiffer than some I&#x27;ve tried, so my back feels very clean. The plastic handle cleans easily so there is no disgusting build up or cracking. The brush comes with a loop to hang it in the shower and has a nice long reach. I had no trouble reaching my back. I also have a bad knee and it was very easy just to bend over and get my feet and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Very nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sent for evaluation</li>
    <li> item was as described. quick ship, good vendor. A++++</li>
    <li> Great brush... a little stiff but I&#x27;m hoping it softens up with time.</li>
    <li> The best brush I have ever used.My wife loves it too.will buy another two in a couple of week and pass them on to my kids.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush in Germany last year and still in good shape.Use it everyday for body brushing and exfoliating before I get into the shower. Also got the blue one for my partner to use as a bath brush.</li>
    <li> This worked out well.  I love the length/</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Easy to clean. Handle material not subject to mold. Exfoliates well.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> What a great brush!  I have been dry skin brushing for awhile now and the one I was using before now feels so brittle.  The bristles are not too stiff which is important to me because I have sensitive skin. I have tried it in the shower and like the way the handle curves.  It makes for easier use on my back area.  I also noticed that the bristles did not get overly soft like some other brands when it is used in warm water.  Definitely a plus!.  The grips make for a good grip and the string makes for easy access on the shower caddy.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a shower brush but decided to buy one.  I purchased this one based on the reviews and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> works great, I am very happy with it. I recommend it to all out here, you&#x27;ll love it for sure.</li>
    <li> It is good quality - but the bristles are just too hard.  I ended up throwing both of them away after a couple uses.  I thought I liked them at first, I knew the bristles were really firm but I thought maybe it would soften up a little after some use.  In the end, no matter how gently I tried to use it, it just ripped my skin up.</li>
    <li> I usually end up with bath brushes that have wooden handles and super stiff bristles. This one&#x27;s handle is made of very sturdy plastic and to me seems more sanitary.  I can only imagine what kind of germs my old bath brushes were harboring.  The bristles them selves are not very stiff. And even if you find there are once you ket the brush sit in warm water for a min they become more pliable.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have a few must have&#x27;s  in my shower, and I have added this to my list. I can reach every spot on my back with the length of this brush. The bristles are neither too stiff or too soft and respond well to the level of pressure you prefer. My skin feels great after I use this. Well circulated and exfoliated. I am very happy with my order.</li>
    <li> This brush has bristles that are stiff enough to do the job but are not stiff enough to be painful on the tender back skin.  I am six feet and the handle is plenty long enough for me.  I mostly use it on my upper back and shoulders.</li>
    <li> I have fibromayalgia. I wanted something to make showers easier. Holding this hurts my hand and lower arm. I have since tried an exfoliating shower glove and that seems to work way better. I wish I would of thought of it sooner. 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t really get sudsy as I would have imagined and it is kind of stiff.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are stiffer than I thought they would be.  They are perfect.  I really like the curve of the brush.  The only thing that would make it better would be if it were a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I love this bath brush. It is not heavy like my wooden handle bath brush. The bristle are not as hard on the skin, and not too soft either, I am very pleased. I need to change the cord to a little longer one. I like to wrap the cord around my wrist when scrubbing my back so I don&#x27;t drop the brush.</li>
    <li> I am just learning about dry brushing and how great it is for your lymph system so I really appreciate this brush and the free dry brushing ebook, With this bath brush and the info it gives I have what I need to understand and do the process correctly. The reach of the brush is excellent and the bristles firmness is just right.  The bristles feel good on my skin and yet give the firmness needed to exfoliate. I am also happy with the way the brush design distributes the pressure I apply, this is the feature that sold me.  My back thanks you too, this brush lets me get to that hard to massage spot.</li>
    <li> This brush was better than expected.  The handle is very sturdy and the bristles are soft.  Was able to reach hard places with the long handle.  Like the loop on the handle so I can hang in the shower to dry.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s all right I guess...but the handle isn&#x27;t as long as I had thought it would be. The bristles are soft enough and it is probably just fine for a younger more agile person...! It&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; in its appearance, which is fine, of course, and yet I&#x27;m having trouble actually using it on anything but my shoulders...and that is tricky too. Of course there&#x27;s really nothing wrong with it...it just needs to have a more flexible wand/handle if it is to be used successfully by someone who is somewhat physically challenged. I had so much better luck with one of those flexible bands that have rows of soft plastic scrubber bristles to slide back and forth over one&#x27;s back. I&#x27;ll give this one to one of my daughters.</li>
    <li> Just got this and tried it today. Great for exfoliating and the bristles are just right . Love the handle length for scrubbing my feet and back. Very sturdy,too and has a rope for hanging conveniently.</li>
    <li> My favorite back scrubber. Love the stiff bristles and the handle because it is just the right length to reach entire back but not so long that it hits the shower walls when in use.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for several days in a row now. The bristles are a little rough for my sensitive skin on my back, but I love it on my legs. Especially the back of my thighs. The ridged handle is good for holding onto when you have soapy hands! It feels sturdy and made of high quality materials. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now. I like it and especially the smaller size for scrubbing my front side and feet. It could use a longer handle to make it easier to reach my back side. The bristles are stiff and great for getting off all the dry skin.</li>
    <li> Dry brush or scrub brush, works well both ways.  Bristles firm, easily softened for back scrubbing holding under warm shower water. Sturdy. easy to hang on bath basket, easy to clean during shower. Solid gift especially for post op patients for hard to reach spots not just the back.</li>
    <li> Bristles have good stiffness. Length and slight curvature are sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic handle slippy in soapy environment. Has held up well after months&lt;br /&gt;of use. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This brush was the more expensive one I got and I liked it the least. The handle looks much longer in the advertisement. So besides the handle not being long enough to really reach all of my back, the brush part is small (at least for me) and the bristles are WAY WAY TOO SOFT.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on the day I was informed without any problem.</li>
    <li> I am a 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; male and I&#x27;ve used this for about a week.  If anything the handle could be a little longer but I am getting much better at reaching with it.  The bristles are perfect!  My itching back is invigorated during use and calmed afterwards.  Great product.  I definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pretty much as desired with respect to bristle stiffness and size of head.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather it had a somewhat longer handle, but that is a very small issue.&lt;br /&gt;The handle seems to be sturdy enough that it will not break as did some previous brushes.</li>
    <li> This bath brush is close to perfect.  I would have like the handle to be a bit longer, but it is still much better than any other bath / back brushes that I have tried.  The handle does NOT bend or flex.  The bristles are about the right stiffness.  Great purchase.  8/5/2015:  Originally purchased in September of 2014 and just received my second back brush.  Great product.  Also works as a back scratcher in a pinch. It has held up well with regular use.  The handle does not slip in your hand when your hand is soapy.</li>
    <li> I wish the handle were a couple of inches longer.</li>
    <li> Ahhhhhhhhh! Perfecto!</li>
    <li> Horrible! Too hard for skin!</li>
    <li> This is a quality brush.  It is great in every way except for me, an old lady, it is just too short.  The picture looks like a long brush but it is not.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush were a lot rougher than I thought they would be.  I have to brush very gently with it on my skin or it hurts.  I&#x27;m hoping with time it might soften up a little bit, but I&#x27;ll probably be looking for another brush</li>
    <li> Sent it back for a refund, Long handle it was not! Not saying the product is bad but I have one from the 99 cent store looks exactly the same except the cheaper one from the 99 cent store has a longer handle!</li>
    <li> Will be using this brush on Amazon.when I have my hip replacement as I will not be able to bend for a while to reach my feet.  Fast shipping and a great item for me. Thank you very must for featuring this item on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful back brush and exactly what I wanted. It is the right length and such a pretty color...&lt;br /&gt;I received the brush earlier than expected and I was so happy to get it. You will not be disappointed with this seller&lt;br /&gt;as they are right on the ball!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE MY BRUSH!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected and is a great product! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really needing to purchase this item for a few months now. Due to the oils from my hair running down my back after exercise, I&#x27;ve developed a little bit of backne (small bumps). Anyway, I do use my exfoliating gloves typically but they just weren&#x27;t doing the trick. My dermatologist stated that the back requires a coarser method of exfoliation than the rest of the body. Needless to say I&#x27;m really pleased with my brush. It&#x27;s perfect length wise for me and very easy to manipulate. Additionally, it lathers extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it&#x27;s very well made and has no bristles falling out.</li>
    <li> I am afraid the Top Notch body brush I purchased through Amazon was not what I needed.  It is too stiff for me to use in cleasing my back.  It would, however, be good for some peoples use in exfoliating, but for my skin it was even too stiff to use it for that.</li>
    <li> Would be nice if the handle were a little longer, but it works well.  Brush feels somewhat soft on my hand but was the perfect stiffness for scrubbing my back.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Plastic material is stronger, particularity at handle and brush joint where other products have broken.  Bristles close to sweet spot between too hard and soft.  Although I would prefer the natural look of a product made from wood, I can never find one that doesn&#x27;t split or turn a dark color.</li>
    <li> I was desperate to buy a new bath brush that I trusted the rave reviews without doing the research; otherwise I would have caught that the handle is only 10 inches. My current bath brush is 17 inches which I LOVE but can&#x27;t find it anywhere. I received it years ago as part of a bathing gift basket but it&#x27;s finally worn out. I can reach all areas of my back with that thing... But not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles of this brush isn&#x27;t too soft (though I&#x27;d prefer even firmer to really get my back circulation going). For those who experience a little pain with firmer brushes at first - it takes getting used to but you have to keep using it. Then one day it feels great and you won&#x27;t be able to imagine using a brush any softer and you&#x27;ll realize your back&#x27;s skin looks amazing because of the great skin circulation from firmer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to point - I think this is the perfect size for my eight year old niece or my petite sized mom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving the pampering that this brush gives me!  At first I just used it as a shower brush - and it is great on feet!  But then I read the ebook that you can download and started using the dry brush technique.  I&#x27;m a mom of two kids (2 and 2 months!!) so I don&#x27;t get a lot of me time (let&#x27;s face it, I don&#x27;t get any &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time!).  Being able to exfoliate with this brush by dry brushing before I shower feels like a spa get-away for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and my skin already feels softer!  It is invigorating and after dry brushing and a shower I&#x27;m ready to finish the day feeling refreshed.  Plus at the end of a long day, scrubbing my feet with this feels so good and helps me be ready to run after a toddler...again.</li>
    <li> Brush broke on the first usage</li>
    <li> The brush is perfect for our needs, does the job very well.</li>
    <li> Bath Brush with long handle are the right size,the Brush are is not to Hard or soft it just right&lt;br /&gt;I love the color.</li>
    <li> I never dreamed that I could get a good back scrubbing like this, it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Brush is as described and more.  Brush is excellent in all manners and tops in price.</li>
    <li> I finally had the opportunity to try my new bath brush and I absolutely loved it!  The bristles are nice, soft, and gentle to the touch and with all of my vigorous scrubbing on my thin delicate skin no damage was done whatsoever!  On that particular day that &amp;#34;simple old fashioned bath brush&amp;#34; turned bath time into such a refreshingly wonderful experience I had almost forgotten about, since it&#x27;s been quite a few years since I&#x27;ve used a bath brush due to the numerous choices on the market over the years.  Now that I&#x27;m getting on in years my body is a little stiffer therefore I can use a little help I can get.  When I saw the advertisement especially  at that great price I thought why not and let me tell you I&#x27;m so glad I made that decision.  There was only one drawback,  the handle is a little too short for my personal taste.  Other&lt;br /&gt;than that you have a wonderful product that I would highly recommend to each and everyone out there in Amazon land. May I also add my package arrived in perfect condition as well as ahead of time which is often the case.</li>
    <li> Very good brush...I can feel it working when I use it in the shower.  It&#x27;s nylon bristles seem to almost grip the skin as you pull it across your back.  Excellent support with information about the brush and its use from the seller.</li>
    <li> The brush was advertised as having a LONG HANDLE. However, the handle was really TOO SHORT and really NOT LONG ENOUGH</li>
    <li> The bristles are just right. Not too stiff or too flimsy. The handle isn&#x27;t long enough for me but I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; tall.</li>
    <li> i love this bath brush</li>
    <li> Broke in my first use. Brush is rough. Better to use to wash my pots in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;Refund was fast though.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  The curvature is really convenient.  Cannot comment on mildew yet, because I have not been using it for long.  Will follow-up.</li>
    <li> Great quality. It feels great to scrub my back.</li>
    <li> I love the bristles in this brush as it gives my back a good scrubbing but not too hard. Just right for me. The ridges on the end of the brush are good for non slipping when the brush is lathered up, However the handle could be at least 2&#x27; longer as I am short and have short arms and cannot reach down to the bottom of my back.I have to try to reach it from the sides. Other than that it is a great back brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old and have a long history of arthritis which is now starting to cause shoulder pain when I try to wash my back.  I bought a brush to make it easier.  This brush would have been the perfect solution if the handle were a little longer.  I&#x27;m only 5&#x27; 3&amp;#34; so I thought this would be long enough.  Wrong!  I still can&#x27;t reach the very middle of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping it until I find a longer handled brush. It&#x27;s a decent brush for the price.  The curve in the handle is right for the arch of most backs.  The bristles are stiff enough and yet soft enough as not to irritate normal skin.  For those with more joint flexibility and a little longer reach, this would be a nice purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a simple bathing  brush.  The bristles are firm enough to scrub skin but not too rough as to cause pain.  While the handle is adequate, I wish it were a few inches longer to get to the hardest to reach places.  Overall, an inexpensive and useful product.</li>
