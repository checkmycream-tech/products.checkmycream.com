      <li>But that&#x27;s many years away.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more, but I am thankful Amacon has it.</li>

      <li>Why more?</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>i will not be able to get it from you any longer</li>

      <li>Has a great smell and is very soft and conditioning and gentle on the skin.</li>

      <li>I love and prefer the original scent (chamomile, sandalwood, and rose, in the pink bottle).</li>
      <li>I kind of hope it stays just as it is, hard to find but available here on Amazon because if it gets too popular</li>

      <li>Maybe Chandizzle&#x27;s grandma was born in the 1950&#x27;s or 60&#x27;s and would have used Shower to Shower original scent in her 20s or 30s, when it first came out</li>
      <li>I love this original scent the best, but it is impossible to find in stores.  </li>
      <li>If an item lasts for 3 years, buy 3 years worth (if you can afford it).</li>

      <li>Even though I normally can&#x27;t stand to be near anything with the scent of rose in it, Shower to Shower Original Scent does not upset my sensitive nose (except on days where my sinuses were already super enflamed by pollen, but then just about any scent bothers me when my nose is in that condition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In order to be worth buying here the price of this 2-pack of 13 oz bottles needs to come down to about $6, or $7 at the very most.</li>

      <li>This increasingly hard to find product is maintained in Amazons inventory at a great price.</li>
      <li>Another reason might be that Johnson &amp; Johnson doesn&#x27;t make a great deal of profit on this product so maybe they don&#x27;t push it too hard.</li>

      <li>I truly love the different scents and the softness of the powder.  </li>
      <li>(she wasn&#x27;t a grandma then, probably was a hot chickie).</li>
      <li>Love this powder especially where it has the chamomile in it.  </li>
      <li>My favorite product, after trying multiple brands.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Reviewer Chandizzle (on another page) said the original scent smells like his/her grandmother or \\&quot;old woman\\&quot; hugs.</li>
      <li>I was regularly complimented by people I knew and by strangers on how fresh I smelled, using the original scent.</li>
      <li>In my opinion not the longest lasting, but still the most tolerable aroma, particularly when compared to Gold Bond powder.  </li>
      <li>It works very well and is soothing and gentle (doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin).  </li>
      <li>If an item is non-perishable, like this one is, and lasts indefinitely, buy as much as you can afford and need for coming years.</li>
      <li>and it is now priced over twice as much.  </li>

      <li>We&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a good powder that my 90 year old mom won&#x27;t be allergic to.  </li>
      <li>Then again, I read years ago that frying starches like potatoes in hot oil causes a change in the food molecules resulting in the creation of a cancerous chemical, but potato chips are still available (I&#x27;ve cut down on these</li>

      <li>Not sure what to make of the reports since the product is still available, but I think about it when I use it and try to be more careful when I apply it.  </li>
      <li>But I find the scent of the original with chamomile (pink container) to be the farthest thing from smelling like a grandma.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s just too high a price to pay as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>I use it every day after showering and I just love the smell, unlike other body powders this one keeps you dry.</li>
      <li>Maybe that reviewer didn&#x27;t rinse the soap away completely that day before applying the Shower to Shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s probably a very good idea considering the questionable side effects of aluminum and other ingredients in deodorants and antiperspirants.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for those of you who use powder for their body daily!</li>
      <li>This is a great scent, but for some reason almost impossible to find in stores these days.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m old enough to be a grandma</li>
      <li>have read that there are some health concerns regarding the use of talc products so it appears warranted to consider whether you feel you absolutely need to use it and to then be careful when you apply it to not create a cloud of talc that you breathe in.  </li>
      <li>It used to be common, but now I only find the blue bottle, so I&#x27;m glad to find it here.</li>

    <li> My favorite.. great scent.. easy to use.. Just love this product</li>
    <li> QUALITY &amp; PERFORMANCE:&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t be beat. Keeps you cool and dry, much better than regular baby powder. It&#x27;s the corn starch that does that. The baking soda helps absorb moisture and neutralize orders. One reviewer (on another page) said he uses it instead of deodorant due to the absence of aluminum. That&#x27;s probably a very good idea considering the questionable side effects of aluminum and other ingredients in deodorants and antiperspirants. But this same reviewer also said \\&quot;don&#x27;t use it immediately after washing underarms: nasty rash that lasts for days can result.\\&quot; - I&#x27;ve personally used it immediately after washing underarms (showering) for 20+ years and have never had a rash issue. In fact, it&#x27;s just the opposite. The use of Shower to Shower on damp, fresh washed skin will help insure no chafing and rash. Maybe that reviewer didn&#x27;t rinse the soap away completely that day before applying the Shower to Shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENTS:&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the original scent. I love and prefer the original scent (chamomile, sandalwood, and rose, in the pink bottle). Even though I normally can&#x27;t stand to be near anything with the scent of rose in it, Shower to Shower Original Scent does not upset my sensitive nose (except on days where my sinuses were already super enflamed by pollen, but then just about any scent bothers me when my nose is in that condition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewer Chandizzle (on another page) said the original scent smells like his/her grandmother or \\&quot;old woman\\&quot; hugs. But I find the scent of the original with chamomile (pink container) to be the farthest thing from smelling like a grandma. Maybe because my grandmothers were born in the early 1900&#x27;s and used plain talc to keep dry. Shower to Shower wasn&#x27;t even invented during their prime, when they choose their favorite body powder to use for life. Maybe Chandizzle&#x27;s grandma was born in the 1950&#x27;s or 60&#x27;s and would have used Shower to Shower original scent in her 20s or 30s, when it first came out (she wasn&#x27;t a grandma then, probably was a hot chickie). I&#x27;m old enough to be a grandma and I used it when I was in my 20s and 30s, when it first came out, and men loved it. In fact, women loved it too. I was regularly complimented by people I knew and by strangers on how fresh I smelled, using the original scent. As an aside, I personally can&#x27;t stand the smell of traditional baby powder because it reminds me of babies (wet diapers). Yuk!! Go figure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE:&lt;br /&gt;I was buying this item through Amazon Subscribe and Save - FOUR 13 oz bottles for $11.23, sold by Amazon LLC, under a different Amazon.com listing. That was back in May and then the price spiked up to over $15 in June of 2011. But now the Subscribe &amp; Save offer for the 4-pack is no longer available. Amazon has informed me of this by automated email (nice of them, thank you, one of the reasons I like Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save) and their automated system suggested I subscribe to this 2-pack currently selling for $8.31 through Subscribe and Save instead. Well, sorry, but that&#x27;s just too high a price to pay as far as I&#x27;m concerned. In order to be worth buying here the price of this 2-pack of 13 oz bottles needs to come down to about $6, or $7 at the very most. $6 is really the price that would make it a money saving offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears the price fluctuation for this item coincides with when it goes out of stock as well as the rising and fall of the price of oil &amp; gas. More than likely the new stock costs the manufacturer more to make with each new factory batch. Why more? Plastics. When the price of oil increases so does the price of anything made with plastic (the container). And of course the cost of fuel to run a factory and ship goods also goes up when the cost of oil goes up, so items made from plastics get a double whammy when the cost of oil goes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning to everyone - prices of all products will only continue rise as long as the manufacturer and shipping of items relies on fossil fuels. Prices of plastics will continue to rise more quickly than other items for the same reason. When manufacturers get smart and turn to more economic and environmentally friendly energy sources, and when they make more \\&quot;plastics\\&quot; from soy or other sustainable materials, you&#x27;ll see prices finally come down. But that&#x27;s many years away. Until then, to combat the rising cost of manufactured goods, there are three things consumers should be doing right now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Reduce use of (or boycott) any product made with plastics (oil based products) AND be sure to tell the manufacturer why you&#x27;re doing this.&lt;br /&gt;2. Send letters of protest to manufacturers of products made with plastics (oil based products) asking them to start using more economically and environmentally friendly packaging. This would include things like soy based plastics as well as refillable packages with refill containers made from inexpensive biodegradable materials.&lt;br /&gt;3. Lastly, if you cannot do without your oil based products (or items packaged in them) and see no chance of changes in the near future regarding productions costs, we recommend you stock up now, before the prices rise even more. If an item lasts for 3 years, buy 3 years worth (if you can afford it). If an item is non-perishable, like this one is, and lasts indefinitely, buy as much as you can afford and need for coming years. If you can afford a life time supply, buy it now. I know I&#x27;ll be stocking up on this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVAILABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;As other Amazon.com reviewers have mentioned on other pages for this item, for some reason this item is hard to find in stores. One reason I can think of is possibly the competition is greasing the hands of store owners to put their items on the shelves instead (that happens often). Another reason might be that Johnson &amp; Johnson doesn&#x27;t make a great deal of profit on this product so maybe they don&#x27;t push it too hard. Or maybe the profit margin is not high enough for the end seller. I kind of hope it stays just as it is, hard to find but available here on Amazon because if it gets too popular the price may go up even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ ~ ~ ~ ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK OUT OUR FB PAGE FOR MONEY SAVING TIPS, AND PLEASE RECYCLE YOUR PLASTIC CONTAINERS!ies on fossil fuels. Prices of plastics will continue to rise more quickly than other items for the same reason. When manufacturers get smart and turn to more economic and environmentally friendly energy sources, and when they make more \\&quot;plastics\\&quot; from soy or other sustainable materials, you&#x27;ll see prices finally come down. But that&#x27;s many years away. Until then, to combat the rising cost of manufactured goods, there are three things consumers should be doing right now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Reduce use of (or boycott) any product made with plastics (oil based products) AND be sure to tell the manufacturer why you&#x27;re doing this.&lt;br /&gt;2. Send letters of protest to manufacturers of products made with plastics (oil based products) asking them to start using more economically and environmentally friendly packaging. This would include things like soy based plastics as well as refillable packages with refill containers made from inexpensive biodegradable materials.&lt;br /&gt;3.

    <li> My favorite product, after trying multiple brands.  In my opinion not the longest lasting, but still the most tolerable aroma, particularly when compared to Gold Bond powder.  Watch what you pay, since I paid seven seventy six for two thirteen ounce bottles back in January and it is now priced over twice as much.  In my area, some local smaller (non WalMart) supermarkets or drug chains still stock the Shower to Shower brand, and I even located some \\&quot;behind the counter\\&quot; at a Target by asking the pharmacist (they have demand from customers so they order it as a special order to sell to customers who ask for it).  I recently purchased an eight ounce container for three twenty five when I found it at a local supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that there are some health concerns regarding the use of talc products so it appears warranted to consider whether you feel you absolutely need to use it and to then be careful when you apply it to not create a cloud of talc that you breathe in.  I don&#x27;t have a link handy to some of what has been written but you can probably easily find information online by doing a search.  I recall reading that it centered on infants exposed to the talc in the air developing breathing issues and talc having an effect on the mucuous membranes of adults.  From what I&#x27;ve read, many have opted against talc based products, but I have yet to locate a product that is as effective.  Not sure what to make of the reports since the product is still available, but I think about it when I use it and try to be more careful when I apply it.  Then again, I read years ago that frying starches like potatoes in hot oil causes a change in the food molecules resulting in the creation of a cancerous chemical, but potato chips are still available (I&#x27;ve cut down on these but gosh I tend to get tempted from time to time such as with Cape Cod Sea Salt and Cracked Pepper.  It&#x27;s a good thing Cape Cod stopped making their Nantucket Spice version).  However, this may explainwhy the Shower to Shower product is harder to find nowadays.  If anyone has found a non talc product that they feel is effective please feel free to let me know.</li>
    <li> Just what we wanted.  We couldn&#x27;t find it locally. Thx</li>
    <li> The powder smells soooooo good!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 30 years!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a good powder that my 90 year old mom won&#x27;t be allergic to.  This is it.  Soothing for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good absorbent body powder that works!  I used to use Jason&#x27;s chamomile which is no longer made and the odor of the medicated powders are too strong (Gold Bond) and tend to make me feel ill.  I have very delicate skin and after reading the reviews on this product, thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It works very well and is soothing and gentle (doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin).  This is now my favorite body powder.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon! I can never find this at the store! I&#x27;m so glad I bought it, did the trick for me! Has a great smell and is very soft and conditioning and gentle on the skin. I highly recommend for those of you who use powder for their body daily!</li>
    <li> It worked fine, arrived on time, and was not damaged in transit.It worked fine, arrived on time, and was not damaged in transit.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 for the price and it was a while ago.  No only did it come in time, it was boxed nicely and got 2 for the price.  We still have both and love the smell of the power and the product!!  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this original scent the best, but it is impossible to find in stores.  Great to find it online for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shower-to-shower powder for about 25 years!  I truly love the different scents and the softness of the powder.  Living in a warm-to-hot location, the powder is helpful in my underarms and other areas where clothing fits - belted areas, underwear waist and leg holes, on chest, etc. The powder container lasts a long time for all the areas I powder-up!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find that this is still being sold. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this powder and it is getting hard to find.  I am very dissapointed i will not be able to get it from you any longer</li>
    <li> The texture of the powder is silky fine making it easy to spread and keeping you friction-free.  The smell is pleasant and long-lasting making it a great body deoderant.</li>
    <li> I do love this product.  I love the smell which is not intrusive, but just &#x27;nice&#x27;  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more, but I am thankful Amacon has it.</li>
    <li> I use it every day after showering and I just love the smell, unlike other body powders this one keeps you dry. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I hate turning that cap to open and close.</li>
    <li> Love this powder especially where it has the chamomile in it.  Lovely scent and it relaxes you with it&#x27;s soothing scent.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product but learned it, and other talc based powders, have been linked to ovarian cancer :(</li>
    <li> This is a great scent, but for some reason almost impossible to find in stores these days.  It used to be common, but now I only find the blue bottle, so I&#x27;m glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff, and don&#x27;t think I could ever go without it. Nice scent.</li>
    <li> This increasingly hard to find product is maintained in Amazons inventory at a great price. I get it on subscription.</li>
    <li> This is the best body powder ever.  I have used it for a long time.  The fragrance is great and the price is too.</li>
