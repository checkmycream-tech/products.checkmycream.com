      <li>Love it, high quality</li>
      <li>/&gt;Go lightly as first!  </li>
      <li>It was nice getting multiple pairs for gifts!</li>
      <li>I actually just wanted some kind of washing gloves because it seemed simpler than a washcloth.</li>
      <li>Now more that twenty years later I can see these marks starting to fade away from the use of these gloves along with a good body wash soap.</li>
      <li>This has to be my favorite purchase by far, I&#x27;ll be buying again</li>
      <li>These gloves are effective and deeply exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>You really feel clean.)</li>
      <li>So if you would like for your skin to have a smooth and like new appearance again, try these exfoliating gloves.</li>
      <li>Since its polyester and not cotton, it dries super fast (moisture gives things a chance to get moldy, eeek).</li>
      <li>They are very reasonably priced compared to what you can buy in the store.</li>
      <li>Also liked the neutral color which complimented my bathroom better than the pink and blue ones you find in stores.</li>
      <li>first used they can be a bit abrasive</li>
      <li>A gentle touch for your first time is all that&#x27;s required.  </li>
      <li>I have never taken really good care of my skin (not really important to most guys), so I still have dark marks and scaring from when I had chickenpoxs and acne as a kid and would scratch until they bled, or oozed, or whatever, which caused skin damage.</li>
      <li>I thought was decent is now borderline unusable after trying these Earth Therapeutics gloves!  </li>
      <li>They last a good long while too before you need a new pair!</li>
      <li>LOL, I&#x27;m big on ONLY buying American products!!)</li>
      <li>I really like using them.  </li>
      <li>it did not bother it much.</li>
      <li>My whole family uses them to exfoliate with a moisturizing body wash.</li>
      <li>I really, really like these gloves.  </li>
      <li>i use it everyday its soft and good</li>
      <li>are also good for cleaning items that are difficult to clean with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>prefer the gloves to the many other loofah products I have tried.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and the gloves look just like the picture (deep scrubby nubbies--way cool).</li>
      <li>Before putting them on, you wet them, and they will extend and slip on easily.</li>
      <li>Until now, I&#x27;ve purchased the flimsy ones they sell in the drug stores and, while they worked decently, they never tended to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They give you a nice massage, don&#x27;t press too hard, subtlety is</li>
      <li>The price was fair but not great.</li>
      <li>These gloves work much better, for much, much less!</li>
      <li>I live where there is no running water, aside from a hose or a bucket dump;</li>
      <li>and now I&#x27;m using it pretty regular with no issues.  </li>
      <li>The gloves have a knobby texture, but they feel soft and are not hard on your skin at all.</li>
      <li>These potentially could damage you skin if used with too much pressure.  </li>
      <li>Ready for next time.  </li>
      <li>When you order this product, you do receive a total of 4 pairs of gloves, and they work very well.</li>
      <li>I can say is WOW.  </li>
      <li>Use water as hot as you can take it to rinse the face, then blot dry and dab with organic coconut oil!</li>
      <li>These Earth Therapeutics are rather large, thick, and pretty abrasive.</li>
      <li>While the St. Ives Oatmeal &amp; Shea Butter body wash has a nice, faint smell to it, you don&#x27;t smell like a breakfast product after using it.  </li>
      <li>(I have large hands) and can be used wet or dry.</li>
      <li>The yellow ones are a little less abrasive than the green ones but they&#x27;re still spectacular.</li>

    <li> They exfoliate well with a body scrub.</li>
    <li> What a great find! Those gloves fit, well, like a glove! Before putting them on, you wet them, and they will extend and slip on easily. They give you a nice massage, don&#x27;t press too hard, subtlety is the key!&lt;br /&gt;It feels good to foam them up and wash, since I can use my natural hand movements. No losing them or dropping them, like those &#x27;strap across the back of the hand pads&#x27;. I even use them for a facial scrub, but you&#x27;ve got to ease up seriously! It works well! Use water as hot as you can take it to rinse the face, then blot dry and dab with organic coconut oil! Smoooooooth skin ahead!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get yourself a spa treatment at home, get these! You will love them, too! Basically you get 4 pairs for the price of 2. A steal!</li>
    <li> Got really tired of those dollar store specials: elven-sized, holes surfacing immediately upon wearing, and not very scratchy. These Earth Therapeutics are rather large, thick, and pretty abrasive.</li>
    <li> Made in America (I think...LOL, I&#x27;m big on ONLY buying American products!!) Good for exfoliating and giving your skin the best possible treatment, at home, that you can!</li>
    <li> I use exfoliating gloves for almost 10 years now and i wanted to give this one a try. It doesn&#x27;t disappoint but its not the best out there either. For the price, is very good.</li>
    <li> They work as they say in the details and are a neat alternative to using the standard loufa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first used they can be a bit abrasive but your body will get used to it. I would say avoid scrubbing really hard since it does the scrubbing on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Able to hold soap in pretty well, only issue is the awkward trying to avoid not getting soap in your eye if you are conditioned to wiping water from your face in the shower.</li>
    <li> Love these gloves for exfoliation, they are well made.  They are very reasonably priced compared to what you can buy in the store.</li>
    <li> When you order this product, you do receive a total of 4 pairs of gloves, and they work very well.</li>
    <li> These gloves are amazing, as soon as I started using them my skin started to feel softer and smoother. This has to be my favorite purchase by far, I&#x27;ll be buying again</li>
    <li> I actually just wanted some kind of washing gloves because it seemed simpler than a washcloth. I was hesitant to buy exfoliating gloves but these were the best priced ones. I don&#x27;t regret it though these scrub off the grim much better than cloth and the glove is as I suspected easier than a washcloth.</li>
    <li> Much thicker than the shower gloves I&#x27;ve bought in drug stores, which make them more luxurious.  I hang them on the shower door to air dry and toss in the washer and dryer now and then.  Also liked the neutral color which complimented my bathroom better than the pink and blue ones you find in stores.</li>
    <li> These are great gloves and can&#x27;t beat the price. They last about a month per pair--could stretch them longer, but a month is ideal. I recommend getting hooks or somewhere to hang these in the shower so they dry out between use. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> These are the best exfoliating gloves I have ever used! I have never taken really good care of my skin (not really important to most guys), so I still have dark marks and scaring from when I had chickenpoxs and acne as a kid and would scratch until they bled, or oozed, or whatever, which caused skin damage. Now more that twenty years later I can see these marks starting to fade away from the use of these gloves along with a good body wash soap. It took a few tries to get used to using these gloves instead of a wash cloth, but now I think they are much easier to use. So if you would like for your skin to have a smooth and like new appearance again, try these exfoliating gloves.</li>
    <li> These gloves are fantastic. They make your skin baby soft, and it&#x27;s a wonderful exfoliater. I highly recommend this as a cheap and easy way to take care of skin. I use it about once a week. It&#x27;s wonderful at removed flaky/dry or rough skin. Follow with a good, natural moisturizer like aloe gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each pair lasts at least 3 months. I use each for more like 6 months. They are machine washable.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice!</li>
    <li> These exfoliating gloves are the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34;  Do NOT get carried away and scrub your skin too briskly (like I did).  These gloves are effective and deeply exfoliating.  A gentle touch for your first time is all that&#x27;s required.  The action on dry, scaly skin feels so very, very good under a warm running shower; you may have a tendency to get carried away.  However, when you dry off and moisturize-- that&#x27;s when you&#x27;ll know that you&#x27;ve scrubbed yourself raw.  Even your hands from being within the gloves will feel puckered and tender.  Learn a lesson from one who knows that raw, burning feeling that occurred after I put on lotion... Ouch!  The raw feeling left within the day, but... &amp;#34;You&#x27;ve been warned!&amp;#34; These gloves are Fabulous, but must be respected.  I love the fact it was a package of four (4).  I rinse them in the bathroom sink with mild soap, rinse with cold water and hang on my interior shower rail. Voila! Ready for next time.  The shipping was fast and the gloves look just like the picture (deep scrubby nubbies--way cool).</li>
    <li> I like using wash gloves rather than a wash cloth or those poofy things that are everywhere and these ones are really effective. You can reach all the places you would with just your hands and you can feel what you&#x27;re doing. The gloves have a knobby texture, but they feel soft and are not hard on your skin at all. The elastic at the wrist is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t stretch out and become useless after a few uses. I like these. I replace a pair about every three months or so, so I&#x27;ll be getting another four pack here soon (I bought these last February).</li>
    <li> I found shower gloves a number of years ago when I stumbled across them in a drug store and haven&#x27;t showered without them since.  Until now, I&#x27;ve purchased the flimsy ones they sell in the drug stores and, while they worked decently, they never tended to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I thought was decent is now borderline unusable after trying these Earth Therapeutics gloves!  These are very well made, not flimsy at all, and feel great and leave my skin in great shape as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a couple of people say that these are too rough, but they are supposed to be exfoliating gloves and you don&#x27;t want them to be soft.  If you&#x27;re expecting a washcloth like feeling, these are NOT what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you want a loofah-like experience with the mobility of gloves, you have to give these a try.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin and quality seems great but only thing I would have like is that it had a loop so I can hang it in my shower</li>
    <li> i use it everyday its soft and good</li>
    <li> Great - just as expected!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would use these but they are great.  My wife talked me into trying them.  I really like using them.  I have medium sized hands for a man.  They fit well and exfoliate my skin easily.  My wife has washed them in the machine a couple of times with no apparent problems.  I have used them for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go lightly as first!  These potentially could damage you skin if used with too much pressure.  I find that is I use them once or twice a week that is optimal for me.  I really enjoy the tingling feeling after using these gloves with or without soap.  I usually use them with a moisturizing solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it men!</li>
    <li> This is a better product than most any out there.</li>
    <li> love these. i think you can find them for cheaper at target but this brand is good quality and thicker than most others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these gloves for a while now and can leave a favorable review.  I live where there is no running water, aside from a hose or a bucket dump; though I&#x27;ve figured out how to be hygenic with no running water (indoors) I&#x27;ve been concerned with the buildup of dead skin.  These gloves have made a world of difference!  I started out slowly so I didn&#x27;t rub off all 7 layers at once, and now I&#x27;m using it pretty regular with no issues.  My skin is softer and not so flaky  It dies come in a 4 pack, and does not have an odor (I&#x27;m sensitve to things that off-gas).  It can easily be hosed off and dipped in sanitizing water (i.e. silver colloid in water).  It tucks away discreetly, and even if it is in view it&#x27;s no big deal.  Over all it was well worth the price!</li>
    <li> These were ordered for my father who has big hands.  They fit much better than cheaper brands.  It was nice getting multiple pairs for gifts!</li>
    <li> We love these hydro gloves. The price was fair but not great. Would buy them again but would like a better deal.</li>
    <li> These are great gloves. My whole family uses them to exfoliate with a moisturizing body wash. They last a good long while too before you need a new pair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with flaky skin (especially arms and legs), during the late fall and winter dryer winter months (even in Houston, we DO have our dry, cool air periods).  I have usually just used some lotion, but recently, that didn&#x27;t solve the problem.  I have used exfoliating products on my face before, but never my body.  When looking online for possible solutions, I came across the Earth Therapeutics Exfoliating Gloves, and read all of the great reviews.  Got them in the mail very quickly (as with most all Amazon orders), and today I decided to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is WOW.  I was expecting them to be stiffer and harsher on the skin, but they almost felt like regular gloves.  I used the gloves with St. Ives Oatmeal &amp; Shea Butter body wash.  I could tell in the shower the gloves were eliminating the flaky skin problem.  The St. Ives body wash made the gloves glide over my skin.  After the shower, I have never seen my skin look and feel so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These gloves rock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(BTW...I looked at different body wash products to use with the gloves.  Being a guy, I DON&#x27;T want to smell like strawberries, lemons or flowers.  I just want to smell CLEAN.  While the St. Ives Oatmeal &amp; Shea Butter body wash has a nice, faint smell to it, you don&#x27;t smell like a breakfast product after using it.  You really feel clean.)</li>
    <li> I use these gloves almost every day.  I use them for three uses and then send them for a wash.  I really, really like these gloves.  The yellow ones are a little less abrasive than the green ones but they&#x27;re still spectacular.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, using it religiously for my dry SPA treatments - looks,  feels and works exactly as has been described !!</li>
    <li> I stumbled across a pair of these gloves at a friends house and had to find them. The first few places I looked only sold single packages (1 pair) for about $8 each. I was so happy to find these here.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the gloves to the many other loofah products I have tried. They fit well (I have large hands) and can be used wet or dry. I have even thrown them in the wash to extend their life.&lt;br /&gt;They are also good for cleaning items that are difficult to clean with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;I would and have recommended them to friends as well as given them as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;The only things I find odd is the pricing. The 4 pack is the best buy, especially if you are an Amazon Prime Member like me.</li>
    <li> Love it, high quality</li>
    <li> Had a battery operated exfoliating brush, with bristles rotating in circulatr motion. These gloves work much better, for much, much less! Super cheap and super great! Easy to maintain. Since its polyester and not cotton, it dries super fast (moisture gives things a chance to get moldy, eeek). I clean it with soap and water after each use. And hang dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on face, then body, 2x a week. I have mild acne on face, chest and neck, and this has helped. Pores are smaller, and skin is smoother. For less than $3 a pair, its the best and cheapest investment for your skin.</li>
    <li> Works well, long-lasting, everything to like.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these gloves. They work great for exfoliating before sunless tanning. They exfoliate well without being too abrasive. I have eczema in some areas an it did not bother it much. If anything it made it better, because my aveeno and prescription medications were able to penetrate better. Even better, because I got 4 pairs I gave one pair to my husband who likes them too!</li>
