      <li>but these are good too.</li>
      <li>So use it with good heat proofing products.</li>
      <li>this is a HIGH quality item that does a WONDERFUL job.</li>
      <li>We ordered this straightener over the internet and have been pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it works.  </li>
      <li>One additional advantage is that I have been able to extend the time between touch-ups.  </li>
      <li>I was dissapointed that my item did not arrive in time for Christmas, but my 17 y/o daughter who has used and burned through many a hair straightner absolutly loves this one.</li>
      <li>I find I am able to do my hair faster as well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed and thankful for the low cost!</li>
      <li>The Pink Chi has been just wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be really good, but it works just as well as my new $30 straightner.</li>
      <li>The first one had an adjustable thermastat and it worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for such great service.</li>
      <li>It does heat up quick, but with some coersion.  </li>
      <li>She was thrilled that it was pink as this is her favorite color.</li>
      <li>The straightner is worth the price.</li>
      <li>The item works well and the price for the Chi Flat Iron is amazing.</li>
      <li>Could have bought a comparable product at a much cheaper price!</li>
      <li>I have had my first Chi for about 5 years now.  </li>
      <li>Even at this price, the cheap drugstore brand that costs half works better.  </li>
      <li>It works great on my hair which is only slightly wavy.  </li>
      <li>I have really frizzy hair</li>
      <li>They lead you to believe its a real CHI, its NOT.</li>
      <li>My sister&#x27;s have very curly hair</li>
      <li>My daughter was thrilled to have her new Chi flat iron as she has now on her third one.  </li>
      <li>I like the black ones better, it seems they get hotter</li>
      <li>My hair comes out soft, shiny, and straight.  </li>
      <li>I purchaed another one generic and it works just like the real thing.</li>
      <li>I ordered this iron and was surprised to read the information that came with it.  </li>
      <li>However, I noticed that my stylist used one with a fixed temperature.  </li>
      <li>She said no other has made her hair feel so soft.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
      <li>and this is the only flat iron that can make it straight.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a total rip off and I would suggest you stay far away.  </li>
      <li>I bought it for my teenage daughter, and she is still using our old one.  </li>
      <li>The item arrived in a reasonable amount of time and it was as expected.</li>
      <li>We not only found the one she wanted, it cost less and shipped right away.</li>
      <li>The advertising states the iron heats up to 400 degrees, when in fact, it heats up to half of that just like the other cheap drugstore brands.  </li>

<li> I am assuming that the tourmaline has a lot to do with the improved texture of my hair after flat ironing.  </li>
<li> i didnt get my flat iron yet.</li>
<li> My daughter wanted this flat iron for Christmas.</li>
<li> I could not live without this flat iron.</li>
<li> The two reviews are not good but the explanations are rasonable and they seem like they were willing to help</li>
<li> This product does not work as well as other Chi flat irons we have owned especially for my longer hair.  </li>
<li> I only bought this one because I am a pink fantic.  </li>
<li> I received the item after a long wait and it does not work.</li>
<li> I have long hair</li>
<li> If you spend a little extra money on yourself this is the thing to do it on.  </li>
<li> It was delievered in no time and was what I expected.</li>
<li> We have spent $150 for Chi models.  </li>
<li> That company does offer a pink version that is sold for Breast Cancer Awareness, this is not it.  </li>
<li> They didn&#x27;t answer my email and their phone says closed due to family emergency!!  </li>
<li> This is a imitation!</li>
<li> She has used it everyday since she got it.</li>
<li> I have been using it for the past 4 months now.</li>
<li> and I finish in usually 10 mins.</li>
<li> So don&#x27;t go by all the negative reviews.</li>
<li> When its all said and done, it flattens my hair, but I&#x27;m late to work by then.</li>
<li> If you have really thick ,curly hair it will straighten it in no time.</li>
<li> so I can file a false advertising claim with amazon!</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> and im kinda scared because the discussions at the bottom are bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a imitation! They lead you to believe its a real CHI, its NOT. Also.. NO RETURN policy!! Could have bought a comparable product at a much cheaper price!</li>
    <li> The item arrived in a reasonable amount of time and it was as expected. The item works well and the price for the Chi Flat Iron is amazing.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this flat iron for Christmas. We not only found the one she wanted, it cost less and shipped right away. She has used it everyday since she got it. Thanks for such great service.</li>
    <li> This product is not at all what it claims to be.  The advertising states the iron heats up to 400 degrees, when in fact, it heats up to half of that just like the other cheap drugstore brands.  Even at this price, the cheap drugstore brand that costs half works better.  I bought it for my teenage daughter, and she is still using our old one.  I wish I read the reviews before I bought this.</li>
    <li> I received the item after a long wait and it does not work. Will not turn on. No response to multiply emails for refund. I have been trying to make contact for weeks. Don&#x27;t buy from these guys.</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled to have her new Chi flat iron as she has now on her third one.  She was thrilled that it was pink as this is her favorite color.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts. Both people are VERY happy</li>
    <li> I have three daughters who have all used different levels of straighteners.  We have spent $150 for Chi models.  They eventually stop working.  We ordered this straightener over the internet and have been pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it works.  My daughters find no difference between this and the $150 model.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I have been using it for the past 4 months now. No problem at all. I have long hair and I finish in usually 10 mins. The only thing is that it may dry your hair out with constant use. So use it with good heat proofing products.</li>
    <li> I like the black ones better, it seems they get hotter but these are good too.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be really good, but it works just as well as my new $30 straightner.</li>
    <li> This is my second chi flat iron.  The first one had an adjustable thermastat and it worked just fine.  However, I noticed that my stylist used one with a fixed temperature.  So when I saw this one on sale, I decided to purchase it.  The Pink Chi has been just wonderful.  The temeperature is perfect.  My hair comes out soft, shiny, and straight.  I find I am able to do my hair faster as well.  I am assuming that the tourmaline has a lot to do with the improved texture of my hair after flat ironing.  One additional advantage is that I have been able to extend the time between touch-ups.  I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is my second Chi.  I have had my first Chi for about 5 years now.  I only bought this one because I am a pink fantic.  If you spend a little extra money on yourself this is the thing to do it on.  I could not live without this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I orderd it 3 days ago and it said it was in stock, but I still have not gotten an e-mail from them telling me it was shipped. I would like to know the shipping number. The two reviews are not good but the explanations are rasonable and they seem like they were willing to help</li>
    <li> I was dissapointed that my item did not arrive in time for Christmas, but my 17 y/o daughter who has used and burned through many a hair straightner absolutly loves this one. She said no other has made her hair feel so soft. So don&#x27;t go by all the negative reviews. The straightner is worth the price.</li>
    <li> It works great on my hair which is only slightly wavy.  My sister&#x27;s have very curly hair and it works on them too!</li>
    <li> i didnt get my flat iron yet. ive been waiting for a while. and im kinda scared because the discussions at the bottom are bad</li>
    <li> I am returning it, doesnt work as stated. I purchaed another one generic and it works just like the real thing. This one is nothing like what it is suppose to be.</li>
    <li> Lack of research on my revealed to me that this was not the \\&quot;CHI\\&quot; that everyone was talking about.  That company does offer a pink version that is sold for Breast Cancer Awareness, this is not it.  It does heat up quick, but with some coersion.  I have to test the pulg two or three times before it comes on and sometimes the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; indicator doesn&#x27;t even come on then.  When its all said and done, it flattens my hair, but I&#x27;m late to work by then.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best falt irons that I have ever used.  I have really frizzy hair and this is the only flat iron that can make it straight.  Everyone should buy this product!!!!</li>
    <li> It was delievered in no time and was what I expected. But it does not work as well as the regular CHI flatiron.</li>
    <li> This works great ! If you have really thick ,curly hair it will straighten it in no time.</li>
    <li> although this didn&#x27;t turn out to be the \\&quot;Chi\\&quot; product that we thought...this is a HIGH quality item that does a WONDERFUL job. I&#x27;m very impressed and thankful for the low cost!</li>
    <li> I ordered this iron and was surprised to read the information that came with it.  It says heats to 80-200 degrees.  Not the 410 degress they claim.  It&#x27;s a total rip off and I would suggest you stay far away.  They didn&#x27;t answer my email and their phone says closed due to family emergency!!  Sounds fishy to me!  Waiting for the time period so I can file a false advertising claim with amazon!</li>
    <li> This product does not work as well as other Chi flat irons we have owned especially for my longer hair.  Disappointing. We did receive it promptly from Amazon and it was in perfect condition.</li>
