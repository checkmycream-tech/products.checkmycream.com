      <li>its good.</li>
      <li>loved it.....</li>
      <li>and it did a good job.</li>
      <li>This product is really good</li>
      <li>Better than paying at the salon!</li>
      <li>And I love the idea about using paper instead of the collars, it works amazing!</li>

      <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone as it is a great buy!</li>
      <li>It is like going to a salon in the comfort of your own home.</li>
      <li>Not painless, but the results are effective.</li>
      <li>i can now save money while doing it in the privacy of my own home and at my convince.</li>
      <li>but it was very easy to use and did the job.</li>
      <li>After I got the hang of it though, I liked it and will continue to use it for touch ups :)</li>
      <li>I love My Gigi Waxer since i do my own waxing....</li>
      <li>So easy!  </li>
      <li>am really pleased with this seller,packagin,and</li>
      <li>and I got a warmer and free honee all purpose wax with strips for 25 bucks!</li>
      <li>I was able to get rid of most using a baby oil</li>
      <li>just be sure to use with care-- when you lift the applicator out of the wax, spin it because the wax gets stringy.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, works very well.</li>
      <li>I love the Honee wax and the warmer</li>
      <li>But once you figure out exactly what you&#x27;re doing with the equipment, it&#x27;s fantastic, and a great deal.  </li>
      <li>as other posts said, the directions are not the best.  </li>
      <li>other than that a great product!</li>
      <li>ON HAND FOR EASY CLEAN-UP</li>
      <li>Eventually, I tried it without and it&#x27;s fine,</li>
      <li>I love this waxing machine it is very much salon quality!</li>
      <li>Oh and I got the package in 2 days w/ the free shipping.</li>
      <li>This warmer is fabulous.</li>
      <li>It was very easy to assemble, very convenient and is cost efficient.</li>
      <li>I was quite excited about this product when I read the reviews.</li>
      <li>There were no instructions in regards to handling the wax or how to clean it.</li>
      <li>Honee wax is wonderful, it really grabs the hair and wasn&#x27;t messy--</li>
      <li>I attempted to use the Poetic wax kit, but it took forever to warm up on the stove top and cooled down to quickly.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and very efficient.</li>
      <li>i bought this for my little sister for her birthday, she was SO happy with it.  </li>
      <li>If its too hot, the wax will not come off your skin when you pull the strip so if its not stringy, let it cool until it is to save yourself the pain and hassle of trying to pick hardened wax off of your skin.</li>
      <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
      <li>I use it often and simply go to a beauty store when I need any more wax strips or wax sticks, etc.</li>
      <li>came so fast also.from purchase day and in two day i had it!</li>
      <li>The only thing that would make it better would be if it was easier to remove</li>
      <li>I loved the idea of a previous reviewer of using a sheet of paper around the wax container!      </li>
      <li>I GOT PROFESSIONAL RESULTS RIGHT FROM THE COMFORT OF MY HOME!  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great product and it will save a lot of money that you would have spent on professionals!</li>
      <li>it is large and takes up quite a bit of counter space.</li>
      <li>Thanks alot</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t have to worry about going to the salon and spending so much money for something i can do myself.the product</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than going to a salon.  </li>
      <li>The packaging of the external box was poor but the box inside and waxer were in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>The wax warmer works well and heats the wax up to a decent temperature.  </li>
      <li>Speaking of the strip, the hemp-ish material is very soft and sticks to the wax very well.</li>
      <li>so it won&#x27;t get sticky and messy :-).  </li>
      <li>Other people complained about the wax but it is great for me, sticks well, and cleans off well with the wax remover (sold separately).</li>
      <li>Clear instructions!  </li>
      <li>the print paper covers much more surface than a small ring like the collar) or buying a bunch of collars.</li>
      <li>One recommendation: If you are gonna do your bikini line have someone help you or get that done professionally.</li>
      <li>As a result I am getting professional results with ease and am saving a lot of money (and embarassment) without the need to go to the salon for a routine wax.</li>
      <li>Perfect for every woman, especially those with thick hair ( it&#x27;s grows back lighter) JUST make sure to get PFB so that you don&#x27;t get ingrowns (especially black woman or woman with thick curly hair who are prone to ingrowns)</li>
      <li>You need to make sure its at the right temperature, and that you get a long thin string on the wooden stick when you dip it in the wax.</li>
      <li>I have found that baby oil and warm water can remove the wax but, for convenience, it would be much easier to just use cold wax.</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is in the sparse directions that came with the warmer, but given that it is a simple piece of equipment, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve only used mine twice thus far, though on  alot of places).</li>
      <li>I was interested in getting this product after reading the reviews and I thought to call down to a sally&#x27;s beauty supply store to see if they had it.</li>
      <li>All Purpose Honee waxes on my face with success and very little pain.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several different waxing appliances and finally bought this professional model.</li>
      <li>Also, about half of my wax was stuck to the plastic lid, wasting a large amount...</li>
      <li>, I took the clean collar that came w/ the container and placed it on  another piece of regular print paper(or a few at a time) and cut out the circle in the center, after which I placed both the collar and the paper over the wax pot.</li>
      <li>This worked very well for me after a little practice.</li>

<li> This worked very well for me after a little practice.</li>
<li> So I would recommend that anyone using this product start of with small areas and work your way to where you are comfortable, and hopefully w/ time less spillage will occur.</li>
<li> was a breeze for me.the wax actually took approximately 30-45mins to heat up completely.i was able to get all the facial hair i wanted gone in just a few mins in one pull</li>
<li> Till now I have used this only for one time and not aware how long would it last but would like to recommend to buy this product.</li>
<li> So that I would say is the down side, but of course that is not due to the product but just the fact that you are doing a self wax.</li>
<li> I got sticks and other products that were necessary.</li>
<li> I spent about 30 minutes running around looking for a collar that I thought would have come with it since all the instructions required it.</li>
<li> IF you are prone to ingrowns DO NOT get the wax specifically for brazilian; where it&#x27;s pink, you put it on and manually pull off the hardened wax.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s still a messy job but it was very easy to use and did the job.</li>
    <li> So easy!  Great results! Clear instructions!  Honee wax is wonderful, it really grabs the hair and wasn&#x27;t messy-- just be sure to use with care-- when you lift the applicator out of the wax, spin it because the wax gets stringy.  This will just ensure that you don&#x27;t get small wisps of wax in places you don&#x27;t want them to go.  I loved the idea of a previous reviewer of using a sheet of paper around the wax container!      Overall, this is a great product and it will save a lot of money that you would have spent on professionals!</li>
    <li> I always wanted to buy some warmer for heating wax. Finally I bought this product after reading the reviews on it. I also noticed everybody here using Gigi warmer to which ever beauty parlor I go. I like the heat control switch. Till now I have used this only for one time and not aware how long would it last but would like to recommend to buy this product.</li>
    <li> i bought this combo #2 based on the reviews and i must say i wasn&#x27;t dissappointed at all.some reviews say the product didn&#x27;t come with instructions but well mine did and setting it up with the wax was a breeze for me.the wax actually took approximately 30-45mins to heat up completely.i was able to get all the facial hair i wanted gone in just a few mins in one pull and i may also have been imagining but it wasn&#x27;t painful for me at all compared to doing it at the salon.now i don&#x27;t have to worry about going to the salon and spending so much money for something i can do myself.the product came so fast also.from purchase day and in two day i had it! am really pleased with this seller,packagin,and product.would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product is really good i like it . It&#x27;s kind a easier to me .really its good.</li>
    <li> The wax warmer works well and heats the wax up to a decent temperature.  Unfortunately, the wax can get everywhere and it gets very sticky and messy.  I have found that baby oil and warm water can remove the wax but, for convenience, it would be much easier to just use cold wax.</li>
    <li> I was interested in getting this product after reading the reviews and I thought to call down to a sally&#x27;s beauty supply store to see if they had it. They did have it and it was on sale until the end of the month! (june) and I got a warmer and free honee all purpose wax with strips for 25 bucks! I got sticks and other products that were necessary. One recommendation: If you are gonna do your bikini line have someone help you or get that done professionally. I did my eyebrows no problem. Also, don&#x27;t get the wax off product. Get baby oil it is cheaper and works twice as well. Rubbing alcohol works to get the wax off of hard surfaces.</li>
    <li> There are no warmer collars in this kit (at least mine didn&#x27;t come with one), although both the wax and the wax warmer instructs you to put one on the wax tin. I spent about 30 minutes running around looking for a collar that I thought would have come with it since all the instructions required it. Eventually, I tried it without and it&#x27;s fine, but I recommend a collar eventually.   Also, about half of my wax was stuck to the plastic lid, wasting a large amount... that is, until I peeled it off with my fingers and had my hands coated in wax-film. I still ended up throwing the lid out with a lot attached. I also had to pry it off with my teeth (the lid, that is).     It is extremely sticky, and not coming off my fingers well with baby oil; I&#x27;ll have to scrub hard in the shower, I guess.     Also, there are instructions for the warmer, but no \\&quot;wax-tips\\&quot; or instructions of that nature, so know what you&#x27;re doing beforehand.     Overall, it does the job and it comes with quality strips, and plenty of them for eyebrow-waxers. Better than paying at the salon!</li>
    <li> THIS WAS THE BEST PURCHASE!! WELL WORTH THE MONEY. I GOT PROFESSIONAL RESULTS RIGHT FROM THE COMFORT OF MY HOME!  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL MY FRIENDS! ONE TIP: KEEP BABY OIL ON HAND FOR EASY CLEAN-UP AND YOU ARE SET!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my little sister for her birthday, she was SO happy with it.  the price was excellent and it came with everything she would need to use it!!!</li>
    <li> Im so happy I bought this warmer. I love the Honee wax and the warmer keeps the wax perfect. The only thing I didnt like is the amount of time it takes to melt the wax to the consistity i like. I usually turn it on before I shower and by the time im out its heated (about 1/2 hr). And I love the idea about using paper instead of the collars, it works amazing!</li>
    <li> This is very nice! It&#x27;s just like going to the salon for waxing except I can do this in the privacy of my own home!</li>
    <li> I have paid for eyebrow waxing for years. This product is awesome. It is easy to use and very efficient. Is it my imagination or does it even hurt less? Maybe it is because I control the \\&quot;rip off\\&quot; of the strip. Speaking of the strip, the hemp-ish material is very soft and sticks to the wax very well. A little warning- it is large and takes up quite a bit of counter space. If you have a vanity counter, as I do, it&#x27;s not a big deal. But I don&#x27;t know where you would keep it otherwise... Other people complained about the wax but it is great for me, sticks well, and cleans off well with the wax remover (sold separately).</li>
    <li> This was a great item. I got tried of paying $20.00 a week for brows and lip. Saved me alot of money. !! loved it.....</li>
    <li> Great product! My local salon uses the same waxer, although i wished it had instructions to help newbies (but youtube is just the trick!) other than that a great product!</li>
    <li> I have used the warmer with All Purpose Honee and Espresso All Purpose Honee waxes on my face with success and very little pain.  I have been very happy with the results, ease, and money savings (as compared to a salon).  The only complaint I have is in the sparse directions that came with the warmer, but given that it is a simple piece of equipment, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for me after a little practice. I used it on my eyebrows and upper lip as well as my forearms which have a lot of blond hair, which i just dont like and it did a good job. You need to make sure its at the right temperature, and that you get a long thin string on the wooden stick when you dip it in the wax. If its too hot, the wax will not come off your skin when you pull the strip so if its not stringy, let it cool until it is to save yourself the pain and hassle of trying to pick hardened wax off of your skin. After I got the hang of it though, I liked it and will continue to use it for touch ups :) Thanks, Amazon</li>
    <li> The product is great, with one exception...as other posts said, the directions are not the best.  But once you figure out exactly what you&#x27;re doing with the equipment, it&#x27;s fantastic, and a great deal.  It will save you a lot of time and money instead of having to go to salons all the time!</li>
    <li> This product is gr8 for any wax novice like myself (I&#x27;ve only used mine twice thus far, though on  alot of places). I gave it 4/5 stars b/c as noted before it requires a wax remover,which should have been included. I use regular baby oil, but if you are waxing a long length of skin, eg your leg, it gets a bit tedious because you have to rub at the wax for a bit, and the wax will eventually get on surfaces you don&#x27;t want it on and you will find yourself applying baby oil all over, and then having to wash it of w/ some soap and water. So that I would say is the down side, but of course that is not due to the product but just the fact that you are doing a self wax. So I would recommend that anyone using this product start of with small areas and work your way to where you are comfortable, and hopefully w/ time less spillage will occur. And 1 small detail, I took the clean collar that came w/ the container and placed it on  another piece of regular print paper(or a few at a time) and cut out the circle in the center, after which I placed both the collar and the paper over the wax pot. Therefore when the paper got wax on it, it can just be discarded and you can reuse the collar to cut another piece of paper and repeat. It saves you getting wax all over(since the print paper covers much more surface than a small ring like the collar) or buying a bunch of collars. I say once you substitute some of these accessories w/ a little creativity you can save yourself a lot of money.</li>
    <li> This product works really great!! I was a bit skeptical about it because I&#x27;ve never tried waxing myself always the salons, but the results match the reviews. This really is a great product. And I will continue to use this wax and say goodbye to expensive salons!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it.  I wish it would have come with instructions for waxing, but the product itself and the directions on how to use the wax warmer were great.</li>
    <li> So this deal was great and I just couldn&#x27;t by pass it.  Everything was packaged well.  The warmer came w/ a collar, so I am going to do what was suggested in a previous review and use printing paper over the collar so it won&#x27;t get sticky and messy :-).  Then there is the honee wax, 20 stips and 20 applicators.  For 32 dollars how can I be upset.  Oh and I got the package in 2 days w/ the free shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different waxing appliances and finally bought this professional model. As a result I am getting professional results with ease and am saving a lot of money (and embarassment) without the need to go to the salon for a routine wax. Good value as well.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. The packaging of the external box was poor but the box inside and waxer were in perfect condition. Thanks alot</li>
    <li> This is a great product, works very well. It was very easy to assemble, very convenient and is cost efficient.It is like going to a salon in the comfort of your own home. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone as it is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Very nice wax warmer. U can switch the types of waxes out. I use it often and simply go to a beauty store when I need any more wax strips or wax sticks, etc.</li>
    <li> It felt like it took forever to get to me but I got it just in time for when I needed it ... and the product is amazing!</li>
    <li> I was quite excited about this product when I read the reviews. However, when I got it and opened the wax, it got stuck all over my fingers. There were no instructions in regards to handling the wax or how to clean it. I was able to get rid of most using a baby oil however I felt stickiness on my fingers for the next couple of days. I decided not to use it and return, but the company refuses to take it back.</li>
    <li> I love My Gigi Waxer since i do my own waxing....</li>
    <li> It works fantastically.  I used it on my legs and it was incredibly simple.  Much cheaper than going to a salon.  The only thing that would make it better would be if it was easier to remove</li>
    <li> This warmer is fabulous. I was using a sugar product before, but wanted to try wax. I attempted to use the Poetic wax kit, but it took forever to warm up on the stove top and cooled down to quickly. This is the perfect solution. I used this on my bikini line, with the Gigi wax and it worked great. Not painless, but the results are effective.</li>
    <li> I love this waxing machine it is very much salon quality! I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money to wax i can now save money while doing it in the privacy of my own home and at my convince. You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  why pay someone $45 when you can do it yourself? i prefer the black wax for thicker haired victims like myself lol. I use this about once a month and I&#x27;ll NEVER go back to shaving. Perfect for every woman, especially those with thick hair ( it&#x27;s grows back lighter) JUST make sure to get PFB so that you don&#x27;t get ingrowns (especially black woman or woman with thick curly hair who are prone to ingrowns) IF you are prone to ingrowns DO NOT get the wax specifically for brazilian; where it&#x27;s pink, you put it on and manually pull off the hardened wax.  That one will definitely give you ingrowns.</li>
