    <li> I have been using this cream for almost two years now. I always get complements on my skin and am told how I look so young. No one can guess my real age! I am told I look 21 and I&#x27;m almost 37!!! I always get carded everywhere I go and the best part is I have No wrinkles either!  I love the feel of the cream and the smell. This product works!!!!</li>

    <li> I got a jar of this, along with the eye cream, at TJMaxx last year. After two nights I combed all the TJMaxx&#x27;s in my ate to get more, to no avail. I then combed the Internet....I don&#x27;t know how I ran across it here, but I am so glad I did. I have very sensitive akin, and it is excellent. Rich but nor oily, vitamin C is great for skin, and smells nice to boot</li>
    <li> Excellent.....wake up to nicer skin.</li>
    <li> I have nearly used up a jar of this night cream that I bought at T.J. Maxx for $5. I cannot say enough good about this product, I have sensitive skin also, and it was quite broken out and had dark acne remains before I used this. (About 4 or 5 weeks of use?) I didn&#x27;t know my skin could even look this good. Me! I could tell a difference within the first two-three days. I have used forty years worth of high-end as well as drugstore products on my face, including Regenerist, which had been my go-to facial product. I am SO glad I found this one here on Amazon, as it is no longer available at my two local T.J. Maxx&#x27;s. Great stuff at any price! My skin is now clear, supple, wrinkle-free. I am 62.</li>

    <li> I discover this product at TJMaxx.  I have noticed a different in my skin, it is brighter and less dry as a result.</li>
    <li> Be aware that any creams with Vit C has a particular smell to it.  Personally, I don&#x27;t like that smell. I have used this brand before without the VIT C and I liked it better.</li>

    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer.  I live in Las Vegas and the weather is a bit harsh on my skin. I&#x27;m also an esthetician and vitamin C is great from building collagen and preventing hyperpigmentation. I&#x27;ve gotten great results with this product, that I&#x27;ve even decided to use it on my clients as well. I haven&#x27;t had any complaints about it.  Everyone loves their results and how if feels on their skin.  I would recommend it to others.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I do think my skin is softer and a bit smoother. We&#x27;ll see after a few more weeks...but so far, so good.</li>
