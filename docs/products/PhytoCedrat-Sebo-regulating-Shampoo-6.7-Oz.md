### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I swapped out the cap from another bottle, and now it dispenses perfectly.</li>
      <li>Good package &amp; ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Although I feel like this shampoo does a good job of keeping my hair from getting too oily, the downside is the consistency of it</li>
      <li>This product did neither, so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>I need to get some more!</li>
      <li>I have never been able to do this before!</li>
      <li>I will give an honest critique.</li>
      <li>It lathers rather nicely.</li>
      <li>but it sure didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>I may pay a bit more for them but they are of much better quality, no harmful ingredients</li>
      <li>Smells great, and works really well.</li>
      <li>but I actually love it.</li>
      <li>and I plan on buying more when my bottle runs out.</li>
      <li>When I would apply serums and condioners it didn&#x27;t help and just made my scalp more oily.</li>

      <li>I use it every few days, alternating with PhytoCedrat Intelligent Shampoo or another product, and it keeps my hair clean and lightweight.</li>

      <li>No shampoo is worth risking this agony, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
      <li>Based on my experience, I would not recommend it; however, it&#x27;s always worth the try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shampoo is the only product I have found that effectively controls the oil on my scalp with long-term use.</li>
      <li>Although there were not too many reviews for this product I took a gamble because I&#x27;ve tried other Phyto products that I am fairly pleased</li>
      <li>I still can&#x27;t see right out of that eye.</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth, soft and not oily!</li>
      <li>On top of that, I exercise (vigorously) multiple times a week.  </li>
      <li>I guess my hair needs an extra cleanse :)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos for oily hair.</li>
      <li>First, let me describe my &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Shake the bottle first and use the cap.</li>
      <li>I live in a very hot, humid climate, and my scalp is often sweaty and oily.  </li>
      <li>At first I really noticed the smell</li>
      <li>Most of them will totally dry out my ends after one wash and after repeated washings I end up with the rebound effect, an even oilier scalp.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also super sensitive.</li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work for my hair</li>
      <li>I am 38 and my hair is naturally very oily.  </li>
      <li>the shampoo cleans my hair very well, but does not reduce the oiliness</li>
      <li>But its very liquid, I didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
      <li>And of course it will sting if it gets in your eyes, lemon is acidic but it works very well for oily skin and hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to try this product and even though I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon (it was much cheaper at the actual store!)</li>
      <li>I have an extremely oil scalp and this product does make it better.</li>
      <li>I have used many other products recommended by salon stylists for oily hair and none of them have helped me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells wonderful either.</li>
      <li>I have fine, color treated hair that gets oily at the roots and dry at the ends.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair very clear!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It can be challenging to get the shampoo on my head without it seeping through my fingers and going down the drain!</li>
      <li>I have used it consistently and even let it sit on my hair for several minutes.</li>
      <li>One thing I have noticed is that, for this to work for me, I have to first use a regular shampoo and wash it and then use this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Other products would get my hair clean, but then would stop working after a month or so.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny without over drying.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo helps keep my hair soft, non-oily, and manageable.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had oily hair since I was in Middle School/Junior High.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is the only thing that makes my hair feel normal.  </li>
      <li>Always had an oily scalp (MPB), and this product although not ideal, is better than any previous shampoo I have found, leaving my scalp oil free for hours, but not all night.  </li>
      <li>As others have said, the consistency is a little more watery than normal shampoo, but I just pour a little into the cap and dump it on my head.  </li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal with a cheaper product, but when you pay this much for shampoo, you want to use every last drop!</li>
      <li>The only thing so far that helps with greasy hair!</li>
      <li>One full cap if you have longer hair and less for short hair.</li>
      <li>shampoo leaves my hair soft and lighter, itch-free scalp and no need to wash my hair daily.</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is that the bottle opening is very large, and the product is VERY runny.</li>
      <li>Its very runny so be careful not to pour it all out!</li>
      <li>I like this shampoo, but don&#x27;t really notice any difference from other shampoos</li>
      <li>I usually use even less for the second shampooing because it will make a lot more lather.</li>
      <li>Just now am I noticing my ends getting a bit dry, but I think that can be fixed with some moisture</li>
      <li>Love this product I usually wash my hair everyday sometimes twice a day because of oily roots.</li>
      <li>The consistency is something a user has to get used to, but actually not so bad after a few tries.</li>
      <li>but if my scalp gets irritated due to heat, humidity, hormones or whatever, I use phytoapaisant until it gets back to normal again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First, let me describe my &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34;. I have extremely oily scalp/hair. If I wash it in the morning, by late afternoon I need to pull it back in a ponytail because it gets &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; from the oil. Same thing at night... if I wash it before I go to bed, by morning time I need to brush it back into a ponytail for the day. Although there were not too many reviews for this product I took a gamble because I&#x27;ve tried other Phyto products that I am fairly pleased with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, the bottle comes in a metal-like canister and the actual product has a watery consistency. Needless to say it didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I went to an Aveda store today and bought a shampoo/conditioner set that is formulated to balance out oily scalps/hair (Scalps Benefits Balancing Shampoo/Conditioner). Out of the 577 reviews, only 39 were rated 1, 2 or 3 stars. The rest were 4 and 5s. I&#x27;m excited to try this product and even though I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon (it was much cheaper at the actual store!) I will give an honest critique.</li>
    <li> I wanted it to work but it did only for a few washes and then my hair started getting oily again. Going with something different.</li>
    <li> Love this product I usually wash my hair everyday sometimes twice a day because of oily roots. With this product I can go at least a day without washing it.</li>
    <li> Always had an oily scalp (MPB), and this product although not ideal, is better than any previous shampoo I have found, leaving my scalp oil free for hours, but not all night.  The consistency is something a user has to get used to, but actually not so bad after a few tries. The real only down side is the price. If available, to save money I would be willing to buy a jumbo sized version of this. My actual rating would be 4.5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I have fine, color treated hair that gets oily at the roots and dry at the ends. I&#x27;m a product junkie and I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos for oily hair. Most of them will totally dry out my ends after one wash and after repeated washings I end up with the rebound effect, an even oilier scalp. This product did neither, so I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;ve been using it to wash my hair every other day for about 2 weeks now. My hair is still greasy on the second day but much less than with other shampoos. (I usually use dry shampoo and put it up in a ponytail.) Just now am I noticing my ends getting a bit dry, but I think that can be fixed with some moisture treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that this shampoo is very thin, almost watery and it slipped through her hands. I&#x27;ll agree with that, although I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it slipping through my hands. It lathers rather nicely. At first I really noticed the smell but now I hardly do. It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells wonderful either. My hair doesn&#x27;t smell like it after a wash, so I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product to a friend and I plan on buying more when my bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now. Other products would get my hair clean, but then would stop working after a month or so. This shampoo is the only product I have found that effectively controls the oil on my scalp with long-term use. I use it every few days, alternating with PhytoCedrat Intelligent Shampoo or another product, and it keeps my hair clean and lightweight.</li>
    <li> I am 38 and my hair is naturally very oily.  If I wash my hair everyday, the oil gets worse and worse.  I am the QUEEN of using dry shampoos and thank God for them! I ordered this thinking it would help control the sebum (oil) in my scalp.  I do think it helped a little, but it didn&#x27;t not eliminate my need to dry shampoo a few hours after washing my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and works really well. Leaves my hair shiny and soft. I have definitely noticed a difference with regular use of this product. The only complaint I have is that the bottle opening is very large, and the product is VERY runny. I swapped out the cap from another bottle, and now it dispenses perfectly.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for another person.  as far as I know they liked it a lot.  it helped their oily hair.</li>
    <li> I accidentally got some of this in my eye and it burned like acid. I still can&#x27;t see right out of that eye. No shampoo is worth risking this agony, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Two days later - I am pleased to report that I did not go blind, but I&#x27;m seriously afraid to use this stuff again. :(</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see what the big deal is.  It&#x27;s just a regular shampoo</li>
    <li> This is some of the ONLY shampoo that works wonders on my oily scalp during the winter. Pretty pircey! Its very runny so be careful not to pour it all out! The smell is much more pleasant than other scalp/dandruff shampoos. I need to get some more!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the only thing that makes my hair feel normal.  I live in a very hot, humid climate, and my scalp is often sweaty and oily.  On top of that, I exercise (vigorously) multiple times a week.  This shampoo helps keep my hair soft, non-oily, and manageable.  As others have said, the consistency is a little more watery than normal shampoo, but I just pour a little into the cap and dump it on my head.  It leathers well.</li>
    <li> That was my hair type. I need to not wash everyday, as my hair was dry and frizzy. When I would apply serums and condioners it didn&#x27;t help and just made my scalp more oily. With this product I can actually go a day withou washing. My hair is smooth, soft and not oily!</li>
    <li> My hair is super oily and I have to wash it every day. It is so bad that it will start to look gross after just a few hours of shampooing. I took a chance on this (expensive, for me) shampoo and was sadly disappointed. I have used it consistently and even let it sit on my hair for several minutes. I have not noticed any change in the oiliness of my hair. I also have two other complaints about this shampoo. For one, it is thin as water. It can be challenging to get the shampoo on my head without it seeping through my fingers and going down the drain! I cannot afford that at this price! Second, I am not a fan of the lemony scent. I know other people do, however, so this one is just a matter of opinion. This shampoo did not work for me, but it does have a lot of raving reviews. Based on my experience, I would not recommend it; however, it&#x27;s always worth the try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!: After using this shampoo for a month now, I have actually been able to skip a day of shampooing! I have never been able to do this before! One thing I have noticed is that, for this to work for me, I have to first use a regular shampoo and wash it and then use this shampoo. I have better oil-controlling results this way. I guess my hair needs an extra cleanse :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had oily hair since I was in Middle School/Junior High. For 20+ years, I used the same over-the-counter oily hair formula shampoo. Then, about 2 years ago, I couldn&#x27;t find that shampoo anywhere anymore. Nor, could I find any over-the-counter shampoo designed for oily hair. Does no one have oily hair anymore? I tried using a variety of regular shampoos, but my hair would get oily and stringy by the end of the day. I had to wash my hair every day. Then, my hair-stylist suggested this shampoo. I was hesitant because of the price, but I decided to try it. It took a few tries, but now I only have to wash my hair every other day! Hooray! T&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;he only thing I don&#x27;t like about this shampoo (besides the price) is that it is a thin liquid. It is not thick like most shampoos. If I&#x27;m not quick, this expensive shampoo runs right through my fingers and down the drain before I can even get it onto my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 3-4 years now.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by similar shampoos of this brand, that might contain \\&quot;oily\\&quot; in the title.  I bought some because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and they did not work.  This does work.  It must be the sebo-regulating shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a shampoo that will control or prevent oily hair.  I like this shampoo, but don&#x27;t really notice any difference from other shampoos unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people mention spilling it.  I don&#x27;t have any issues with that- I cup one hand tightly and pour some in my hand.  Next I combine my hands into a larger tight cup and dump shampoo onto scalp.  It lathers well and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I have used many other products recommended by salon stylists for oily hair and none of them have helped me. My hair would get oily within a couple of hours of shampooing, but with this product I haven&#x27;t had this problem at all.  It makes my hair soft and shiny without over drying.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The only thing so far that helps with greasy hair!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work for my hair but it didn&#x27;t. I tried it until the bottle finished with showers every other day. Nothing changed. My scalp actually felt itchy the day after every use and I noticed dandruff, which I did not have prior to using this. Everyone has different hair so it might work for you but it sure didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very clear! But its very liquid, I didn&#x27;t expect that. Need to moisturize your hair, otherwise the hair is not combed. Good package &amp; ingredients.  foam is not very good</li>
    <li> I have been using Phyto products since 2009 recommended by my dermatologist. I alternate between phytoapaisant and phytocedrat since not only I have oily scalp but it&#x27;s also super sensitive. So I use phytocedrat but if my scalp gets irritated due to heat, humidity, hormones or whatever, I use phytoapaisant until it gets back to normal again. I also use phytopolleine once a week before shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo leaves my hair soft and lighter, itch-free scalp and no need to wash my hair daily. Even though some don&#x27;t care for lemon scent but I actually love it. And of course it will sting if it gets in your eyes, lemon is acidic but it works very well for oily skin and hair. They use lemon/ lime ingredients a lot for oily skin/ hair products in asia. Since it&#x27;s very runny, you should not pour it on your hand because you will waste a lot. Shake the bottle first and use the cap. One full cap if you have longer hair and less for short hair. I usually use even less for the second shampooing because it will make a lot more lather. This tip was given to me by the staff at Phyto Salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a true believer in Phyto products. I may pay a bit more for them but they are of much better quality, no harmful ingredients and they work for me.</li>
    <li> Although I feel like this shampoo does a good job of keeping my hair from getting too oily, the downside is the consistency of it makes it hard to use.  The shampoo is so liquid and a lot of it gets wasted unless you&#x27;re really careful when you pour it in your hand.  Wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal with a cheaper product, but when you pay this much for shampoo, you want to use every last drop!</li>
    <li> the shampoo cleans my hair very well, but does not reduce the oiliness and I still need 2 shampoos every day,</li>
    <li> Well, it is not bad. I have an extremely oil scalp and this product does make it better.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that keeps my hair from being oily all day. My head doesn&#x27;t itch anymore either.I have recommended phyto to others as well. Others have noticed scalp itching stopping too. The price seems high until you use it and see how little it takes to shampoo.</li>
