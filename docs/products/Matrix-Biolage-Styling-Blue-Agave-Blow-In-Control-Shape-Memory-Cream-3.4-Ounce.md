    <li> This is very hard to find in stores and other websites, but luckily I was able to find on Amazon.  I have super fine, limp hair, and this really thickens things up and gives it some bounce.  A little goes a long way...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it.  Very heavy.</li>
    <li> Held a blow dry for several days, smells good, and leaves my hair feeling as if there isn&#x27;t product on it.  I like that.</li>
    <li> Works well on curly hair. With this product I can blow dry my hair without frizz.</li>
    <li> Only used it one time.  Not sure yet how I like it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smooth and silky</li>
    <li> This product is amazing smoothing not heavy puts hair exactly where u want love it . Would buy this item again</li>
    <li> if you want a product to hold you hair that will not leave that shinny gel look this is the best product I have found.  And it&#x27;s not sticky either</li>
    <li> Had a sample to use an couldn&#x27;t get this at my salon. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Container slightly sticky when it arrived...had a shipping-type label stuck to it, perhaps the sticky smudged from it onto the container.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay and good price.</li>
    <li> I got a smaple of this when i bought my Biolage Color Shampoo and Conditioner. I LOVE it. I was looking for something that would keep my style but would keep my hair soft and this does the trick. I just put some in my hair when it is wet, blow dry my hair with a round brush and i am done. No more other products. Plus it smells great. Could not find it anywhere, so came to trusty old Amazon. Just bought 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> I have been using Blue Agave Blow-In for over a year now and do really. like the product.  Just one partial pump does the job.  I rub it over my finger tips of both hands and start working it in from the roots out.  Then I blow dry using a round brush.  It seems to keep my style fresh for several days which I love because I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often now as I get older.  (Not that I go with dirty hair..just don&#x27;t have to shampoo  every day as I used to).  My hairdresser first used this on my hair and I was quite happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair really soft and helps to hold your blow dry. If you leave it in with wet hair it kind of helps to hold your natural waves or whatever your hair does.</li>
    <li> My stylist gave me a sample of this and I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine and a short style and I need all the volumizing and texturizing I can get. I also use Aveda or Design Line (Regis) volumizing powder (another great product). Someone even said to me &amp;#34;Your hair must be really thick.&amp;#34; Nope!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in a package that I received and fell in love!  I have naturally curly hair that on occasion I like to straighten.  I put a little in my dry hair and it smooths the curls down before the iron. No flyways and helps keep it strait through humidity and even overnight!  The product I ordered through Amazon was exactly like the sample I received (Ive seen some concerns about counterfeit products.)  If you want your style to stay put, this stuff is perfect!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair product. A hairdresser friend gave me a bunch of hair product samples and this was my favorite one. I have very thin hair and i put this in before i blow dry it and get volume! Also helps with frizz and heat protectant</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this because I was afraid it would leave my fine, frizzy, color treated hair too soft. After reading the excellent reviews, I decided to try it anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised. My hair was soft (not too soft), shiny, smooth, and full of body. My hair felt clean and my style held all day. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have thick, fluffy, frizzy, wavy hair and this stuff plus coconut oil makes my hair look like I straightened it. It stays in well so I only need to use it once until I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Good Price on great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I first got a sample foil packet of this product in the mail from a beauty store... I loved it ever since the first use.  Halfway through the foil pack, I came here in search of this product.  I don&#x27;t know if the product I received was really old or if it was from a different formulation... but what I received was nothing like what I experienced with the foil pack.  It didn&#x27;t fluff up my hair as much, left it flat, got greasy very fast, and was thicker/stickier than what I thought I was buying.</li>
    <li> Great hair stuff!!  Have been buying it regularly.  Does a good job of giving hair some bounce.</li>
