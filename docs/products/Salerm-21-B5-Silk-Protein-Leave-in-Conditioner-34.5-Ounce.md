      <li>This is the first time I am reviewing any product online; I viewed so many excellent reviews that I am compelled to offer my experience hoping that it will help someone who has transitioned from perm to natural, but is looking for an alternative.  </li>

      <li>Great product and this company delivers super fast...</li>
      <li>It softens your hair, but the smell is so strong and smelly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Make my hair frizz free.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair, and it really helps hold the curls in nice ringlets.  </li>
      <li>I have silicon mix and was using that not only as a rinse out conditioner, but as a leave-in (which is great, by the way).</li>
      <li>I can comb right thru it when wet with ease, Best product I have used.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and live in a warm climate, I need a good moisturizer for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I originally found this product in a beauty supply store.  </li>
      <li>Good product in general</li>
      <li>my hair blow with the wind, looks so full, and bouncy.</li>
      <li>I also love the fast way it was shipped to me</li>
      <li>Love it leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>The initial treatment was not cheap because I had all virgin hair which meant applying more of the Keratin treatment, BUT IT WAS THE BEST THING THAT I COULD HAVE DONE FOR MY HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Worth a try.</li>
      <li>I love it for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>Either way this product is worth buying.</li>
      <li>It works great for repairing damaged hair as well as to tame and hydrate frizzy/after-shower hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>the price is right.</li>
      <li>As for the smell, yes it is very strong and \\&quot;perfumed\\&quot; inside the container, but once I applied the proper amount I don&#x27;t smell it at all.  </li>
      <li>One of the best hair care products to dry or just leave it wet.....</li>
      <li>I use about a quarter size amount of Salerm before I blow dry, the difference that I see in my hair is amazing.</li>
      <li>I always come back to this product to do the job and it is very light weight on hair and never greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought a big tub of this!</li>
      <li>Then I started to use more than a teaspoon or my hair about a table spoon or more in four sections (natural thick curly hair) and it keeps my hair soft, manageable, tangle free, free of knots</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, soft, and full of volume.</li>
      <li>It makes the hair super soft.....</li>
      <li>I love it when i blow dry my hair with the FHI blow dryer, it gives my hair so much body.</li>
      <li>I researched for several months and decided on getting a Keratin Treatment just at the time that formaldehyde became a huge issue.  </li>
      <li>I bought this size because it is economic.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate that.</li>
      <li>I really like this leave in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I kept on researching online and finally visited a Dominican Hair Salon that used SaLerm Cosmetics products, formaldehyde free.  </li>
      <li>It comes wrapped very well, however it did have a bit of the product seep through, which wasn&#x27;t a bother at all.  </li>
      <li>I then flat iron eachsection after spraying on the Serum and a very, very small amount of the Silk Touch after wrapping my hair; the result is hair that is very silky, shinny, free flowing &amp; moving and feels very healthy to the touch.  </li>
      <li>However, I quickly realized with my new natural hair length that MY natural hair was far from being easy to manage, but I remained determined not to go back to perms.  </li>
      <li>but my hair comes out very soft after air drying.  </li>
      <li>I used the 8 oz bottle in the past, mostly on my daughter.</li>
      <li>Keeps the hair natural and very soft.</li>
      <li>I have natural afro-textured 3c/4a hair and do not straighten it.  </li>
      <li>This product leave my hair so soft for 3 days until I sampoo again.  </li>
      <li>After one week&#x27;s use of the product, my hair is soft.</li>
      <li>Makes hair soft and it feels protective.  </li>
      <li>My  naturally curly hair loves this product.</li>
      <li>I use no other!</li>
      <li>so i will not down grade it</li>
      <li>The smell, texture and quality was exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I live in a tropical climate and sun dries out my hair constantly requiring me to look for ways to retain moisture in my hair.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely added to the products that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>I really did need to do something about how dry and brittle my hair was</li>
      <li>At first I was ONLY using the Deep Impact Plus Mask after shampooing, but it left my hair tangled.  </li>
      <li>So I transitioned from a perm to natural hair using different latch hook/crochet braids (videos and styles are on YouTube).  </li>

    <li> It makes the hair super soft.....I use no other!</li>
    <li> Best leaving conditioner I ever tried</li>
    <li> I have natural hair that tangles and gets very dry. Problem solved. I can comb right thru it when wet with ease, Best product I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with Salerm 21 B5 Silk Protein Leave in Conditioner.  I have naturally curly hair and live in a warm climate, I need a good moisturizer for my hair.  I can use this moisturizer after a shampoo and or choose to leave it in as a daily moisturizer. It does not leave my hair sticky or weighted down.  Also, buying it in this quantity was cost effective.</li>
    <li> Works great, leaves my hair silky.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I also love the fast way it was shipped to me</li>
    <li> Had to give a 3 out of 4 due to the smell. It works great but i can&#x27;t stand the smell. It&#x27;s too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Fairly good price for a large tub o Salerm.  Good product in general and I like to keep it on hand. Makes hair soft and it feels protective.  Worth a try.</li>
    <li> Yet another present for my mother, so far she loves this product.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. Keeps the hair natural and very soft. I am very satisfied with salerm 21 !!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Make my hair frizz free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful.  When I put other product on my hair after shampoo.  The softness only last one day. The next day, I feel my hair becomes a little dryer.  This product leave my hair so soft for 3 days until I sampoo again.  I will buy more for my family.</li>
    <li> This stuff is going to turn into my holy grail! I&#x27;m so glad I bought a big tub of this! Definitely going to use this in the summer when I go to the beach or just out and about. Also very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Always. I intend to share with my sister. I use a little on my locks and they become moist and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I went for a hair cut at a random salon where my stylist recommended this leave-in conditioner after seeing how extremely damaged my hair was from all the chemical processing and sun etc. I really did need to do something about how dry and brittle my hair was so I purchased a small bottle for $15 and when I ran out, I decided to buy this big tub! Just couldn&#x27;t do without it. It works great for repairing damaged hair as well as to tame and hydrate frizzy/after-shower hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually shampoo and condition in the shower normally, let my hair towel dry a bit then put some of this on, comb and waaaalah! It hydrates my hair wonderfully and I can leave it on for days! Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> not as great as i recall. I used the 8 oz bottle in the past, mostly on my daughter. I have silicon mix and was using that not only as a rinse out conditioner, but as a leave-in (which is great, by the way). So I bought this, thinking I needed a leave-in. Eh. nothing to write home about. I will use it until it&#x27;s done, but it&#x27;s ok. My hair is soft, but the consistency is not as thick as other I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s just me. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Great product and this company delivers super fast... I really appreciate that. Thank you</li>
    <li> It softens your hair, but the smell is so strong and smelly.  There are other things out there to soften your hair, with much less of a harsh smell.</li>
    <li> My wife Is Very happy for the price and the product she ask me Is Very Good.</li>
    <li> EVEN THOUGH MY HAIR IS TREATED, THIS GREAT PRODUCT MAKES IT HEALTHIER!!!!</li>
    <li> It is not authentic. It came in a broken box and the cream leaked out of the jar.  I reached the seller and explained. And they were not proactive. However, Amazon did bring comfort to the situation.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality of mask for the hair, silky finish and nutritive for colored hair. I bought this size because it is economic.</li>
    <li> I choose Salerm 21 B5 Silk Protein, because it make my hair feel soooo healthy after i wash it and put this leave-in conditioner on it. I love it when i blow dry my hair with the FHI blow dryer, it gives my hair so much body. Once i dry my hair i put maybe a dime size of the Marrakesh hair oil in it and then i flat iron and wrap it. i leave my hair wrap for an hour and comb it down and boi ol boi my hair blow with the wind, looks so full, and bouncy. I will recommend this product to every Stylist in the whole world, and the reason why i gave this products the ratting i did because it deserves it, didn&#x27;t let me down so i will not down grade it</li>
    <li> This person sent me a fake product, watery and broken seal. This person is a thief. Their SALERM is a joke. It sure smells lime salerm thou. Good job thief!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product I order it about every month. Sadly in my last order they sent the Wheat germ and I hate it. I kept it to give it a try but it smells and to my disappointment it doesn&#x27;t provide the conditioning I expected and was use to from the salerm 21 B5 leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great it makes your hair so soft. since I have been using it my hair is longer and stronger.</li>
    <li> The product is good, it just smells too perfumy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product helped very dry hair the quantity has last a long time.</li>
    <li> I recently began using this product a few days ago and really like it.  I have natural afro-textured 3c/4a hair and do not straighten it.  It does not have the best \\&quot;slip,\\&quot; but my hair comes out very soft after air drying.  As for the smell, yes it is very strong and \\&quot;perfumed\\&quot; inside the container, but once I applied the proper amount I don&#x27;t smell it at all.  The first time I used it, I put too much in my hair and there was a faint scent that faded over time, but even that did not bother me.  However, everyone has different sensitivities to smell.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I am reviewing any product online; I viewed so many excellent reviews that I am compelled to offer my experience hoping that it will help someone who has transitioned from perm to natural, but is looking for an alternative.  So, after years of perming my hair, I got to a point where I just couldn’t do it anymore.  So I transitioned from a perm to natural hair using different latch hook/crochet braids (videos and styles are on YouTube).  When your hair is in a protective hairstyle it will grow no matter what type of hair you have.  However, I quickly realized with my new natural hair length that MY natural hair was far from being easy to manage, but I remained determined not to go back to perms.  I researched for several months and decided on getting a Keratin Treatment just at the time that formaldehyde became a huge issue.  I kept on researching online and finally visited a Dominican Hair Salon that used SaLerm Cosmetics products, formaldehyde free.  The initial treatment was not cheap because I had all virgin hair which meant applying more of the Keratin treatment, BUT IT WAS THE BEST THING THAT I COULD HAVE DONE FOR MY HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue then became maintenance.  At first I was ONLY using the Deep Impact Plus Mask after shampooing, but it left my hair tangled.  As a result, after combing through and blow drying I had some breakage; then I reviewed, ordered, and used Salerm21.  I now use the Salerm Maintenance Shampoo, Salerm21 together with the Deep Impact Plus Mask, the Serum and Silk Touch; I placed an order with ienjoybeauty and received my order in 3 days (that was three days ago before Thanksgiving 2013).  The 5 products that I mentioned above have now replaced EVERY item in my hair care regimen.  Salerm21 is a leave-in conditioner that I use and leave on with the Deep Impact Plus Mask (after shampooing), after washing out the conditioner and mask, I then apply a small amount of Salerm21 before blow drying.  I then flat iron eachsection after spraying on the Serum and a very, very small amount of the Silk Touch after wrapping my hair; the result is hair that is very silky, shinny, free flowing &amp; moving and feels very healthy to the touch.  I will also use a small amount of Salerm21 on a daily basis in between shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;I thank each person who reviewed these products, especially Salerm21; I learned a lot and I am hoping to pass the information and my experience on to others; thank you.</li>
    <li> Amazing product of course. But HORRIBLE SHIPPING 1/4 of the product was all over the container and the bubble wrap like really? Bubble wrap?! And to top it off, the 2nd lid it came with to put in the pumper was broken ! Very displeased :(</li>
    <li> My  naturally curly hair loves this product. I use about a quarter size amount of Salerm before I blow dry, the difference that I see in my hair is amazing. My hair is shiny, soft, and full of volume. This is definitely added to the products that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and loved the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this leave in conditioner.  I have curly hair, and it really helps hold the curls in nice ringlets.  It has a nice scent that is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly six months now, and it has made my hair less brittle and course.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  After one week&#x27;s use of the product, my hair is soft.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser started selling this to me and I wasn&#x27;t using a lot of it.  Then I started to use more than a teaspoon or my hair about a table spoon or more in four sections (natural thick curly hair) and it keeps my hair soft, manageable, tangle free, free of knots and it feels like silk for days.  I only bought this here because my hair dresser only sells the small squeeze bottle and I wanted to save money by getting the liter since I am using more of the product.  I still can&#x27;t find this in stores so I will keep getting it.  Love it!  Best leave-in conditioner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this product. You can choose to leave it in or do a deep conditioner with it and rinse it out. Either way this product is worth buying.</li>
    <li> Love this product, leave my hair in a really good shape. Super happy!!!!</li>
    <li> Is a great product i really like it and the price is right. ......thank u!</li>
    <li> My hair is transformed instantly with this product.  I live in a tropical climate and sun dries out my hair constantly requiring me to look for ways to retain moisture in my hair.  I always come back to this product to do the job and it is very light weight on hair and never greasy.  Having it in this larger size is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> Love it leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Great product leaves your hair shine lokking smooth smells really good i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair care products to dry or just leave it wet.....u have a customer for ever!!!!!! thank you:)</li>
    <li> I originally found this product in a beauty supply store.  This package was the same as what I had purchased in the supply store.  The smell, texture and quality was exactly what I expected.  It comes wrapped very well, however it did have a bit of the product seep through, which wasn&#x27;t a bother at all.  I use it after my hair drys naturally and before the flat iron.  Sytlists may use it after the hair is flat ironed. The results are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Salerm is THE BEST leave in conditioner out! I love it for my natural hair. I&#x27;ve been using Salerm for over 7yrs way back when I had permed hair.</li>
