      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I advice you NOT to waist you money or precious time waiting on this product !</li>
      <li>and nobody&#x27;s guessed yet that it isn&#x27;t my own hair.</li>
      <li>Nice peace of hair, love the 5 clip , soft, length is perfect</li>
      <li>I have had them for two days now and they are super amazing!</li>
      <li>To achieve the look on the picture you will need more than one clip.</li>
      <li>It was just okay.</li>
      <li>I just love them.</li>
      <li>I was able to straighten the hair</li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;m going to order more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok i guess for the price</li>
      <li>love how the curls bounce, it tangles just a little.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn it on more than one occasion</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to give it a good comb through upon receiving, work from the bottom up, and you won&#x27;t have such a problem with tangling.</li>
      <li>Knots up easily though.</li>
      <li>These get tangled really easily</li>
      <li>Hair extentions knot easily, and the hair falls out often.</li>
      <li>They feel so real and blend in perfectly just be gentle when opening and comb gently with fingers!</li>
      <li>Was nice, for the money, will get knotted if not cared for really really really well.</li>
      <li>in the description, but other than that, it&#x27;s easy to manage and it looks great.</li>
      <li>Looked awesome the first time I wore it, but throughout the day it turned into a huge mess</li>
      <li>I ordered these extensions before many times, the very 1st time I did they came in about 2 weeks</li>
      <li>A great buy, looks natural even though it isn&#x27;t and very soft to the touch</li>
      <li>Beautiful matching with my hair but gets super tangled and its to heavy</li>
      <li>Overall an amazing extension and def worth buying!</li>
      <li>I love how soft they are and how bouncy the curls are.</li>
      <li>I just wish they were a little light !!!</li>
      <li>Right now I do have my hair thinned out</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.!!</li>
      <li>and they look exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for and feel and look incredibly real.</li>
      <li>, I was very satisfied, the 2nd time I ordered them they came in about the same time</li>
      <li>Also they cant take much heat.</li>
      <li>Over all not what i expected couldve been better by alot.</li>
      <li>would recommend this piece, you may want to buy more than one for a fuller look, it arrived before I expected</li>
      <li>but I had to keep the heat on a low setting so it didn&#x27;t burn the hair which Is ok because clearly it&#x27;s not human hair.</li>
      <li>But if you want a realistic, usable hair extension - this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>They get tangled to easily and are not as soft as I expected I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend these.</li>
      <li>well then you might have to come a little more out of pocket.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soft and have a lot of body.  </li>

<li> However the\\&quot;darkest black\\&quot; is not anywhere near black and</li>
<li> My hair is already long so I just needed something to make it look fuller.</li>
<li> Not as long as I&#x27;d hoped for but still!</li>
<li> -- mine looks like the one in the previous photo posted for this hairpiece rather than the current image.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if the change in photo&#x27;s is an indication of change in their product or not, but if it&#x27;s the same as what I got in this purchase, I&#x27;d definitely buy this hairpiece again.</li>
<li> my other review cause</li>
<li> They came in wayyy before expected and Intime for my wedding!  </li>
<li> But I wear mine with a black headband.</li>
<li> Less hassle.</li>
<li> Here are a few pictures.</li>
<li> One is too thin and not enough to achieve the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; look.</li>
<li> &quot; it&#x27;s a ponytail with a ribbon and one extremely weak clip piece</li>
<li> and I was unable to comb or brush through.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t buy it its fake hair it burns when you iron it and the hair falls out</li>
<li> Nasty, matted up mess.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed and unsatisfied</li>
<li> hate it</li>

    <li> I advice you NOT to waist you money or precious time waiting on this product ! It is not&lt;br /&gt;what it appears to be !</li>
    <li> To achieve the look on the picture you will need more than one clip. One is too thin and not enough to achieve the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> It was not as its described.. \\&quot; a 5 clip piece\\&quot; it&#x27;s a ponytail with a ribbon and one extremely weak clip piece and it took over a month to arrive. I&#x27;m disappointed and unsatisfied</li>
    <li> Was nice, for the money, will get knotted if not cared for really really really well. My suggestion, pony up the doe for the good stuff. Less hassle.</li>
    <li> These get tangled really easily but they came in WAY BEFORE they were supposed to and they look exactly like the picture. I highly recommend these.!!</li>
    <li> Hair extentions knot easily, and the hair falls out often. Also they cant take much heat. Heat singes the bottem of hair. Over all not what i expected couldve been better by alot.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for and feel and look incredibly real. I love how soft they are and how bouncy the curls are. I just love them.</li>
    <li> Got these to wear at my wedding! And they are amazing!!! My hair was gorgeous and no one could even tell they were extensions!! They are awesome quality!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit thinner than I thought it would be from the picture and the word &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; in the description, but other than that, it&#x27;s easy to manage and it looks great.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re soft and have a lot of body.  However the\\&quot;darkest black\\&quot; is not anywhere near black and the curly extensions are not the 23\\&quot; as advertised; they are about 20\\&quot;. So there are some variations between the actually product and its description and advertisement</li>
    <li> I had to delete my other review cause Amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me post a picture with an update. But omg these are amazing! I have had them for two days now and they are super amazing! It&#x27;s so beautiful! Not as long as I&#x27;d hoped for but still! Here are a few pictures. Right now I do have my hair thinned out so I may have to order another one. But I wear mine with a black headband. You&#x27;ll see it in my pictures. Overall an amazing extension and def worth buying!</li>
    <li> They get tangled to easily and are not as soft as I expected I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend these.</li>
    <li> I really loved it easy to use and looks great</li>
    <li> Love it! I wish I could buy two or more!  Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to give it a good comb through upon receiving, work from the bottom up, and you won&#x27;t have such a problem with tangling. I&#x27;ve worn it on more than one occasion and nobody&#x27;s guessed yet that it isn&#x27;t my own hair.

    <li> Nasty, matted up mess. Looked awesome the first time I wore it, but throughout the day it turned into a huge mess and I was unable to comb or brush through. Would work for Halloween. But if you want a realistic, usable hair extension - this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Nice peace of hair, love the 5 clip , soft, length is perfect&lt;br /&gt;I love how the curls bounce, it tangles just a little.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this piece, you may want to buy more than one for a fuller look, it arrived before I expected</li>
    <li> My hair is already long so I just needed something to make it look fuller. Looks great and matches my hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> Beautiful matching with my hair but gets super tangled and its to heavy I brush them and they return the way they came I just wish they were a little light !!!</li>
    <li> Bought this hair to just add some volume to my hair for my matirnity pictures and it turned out great! I was able to straighten the hair but I had to keep the heat on a low setting so it didn&#x27;t burn the hair which Is ok because clearly it&#x27;s not human hair. I was very satisfied with the price and the hair. If your expecting something that will last longer well then you might have to come a little more out of pocket.</li>
    <li> These are amazing for the price!! They came in wayyy before expected and Intime for my wedding!  I will definitely be buying these again to wear again! !! They feel so real and blend in perfectly just be gentle when opening and comb gently with fingers!</li>
    <li> I actually love the hair!</li>
    <li> Only received tracks w out clips.</li>
    <li> I ordered these extensions before many times, the very 1st time I did they came in about 2 weeks &amp; they were human hair, I was very satisfied, the 2nd time I ordered them they came in about the same time but this time they were synthetic hair which I did not expect &amp; did not like, I ordered some once again &amp; I am still waiting for them &amp; its been over a month, I&#x27;m not too happy about it.</li>
    <li> Loved the way it looked but kinda like doll hair sorta but great quality (:</li>
