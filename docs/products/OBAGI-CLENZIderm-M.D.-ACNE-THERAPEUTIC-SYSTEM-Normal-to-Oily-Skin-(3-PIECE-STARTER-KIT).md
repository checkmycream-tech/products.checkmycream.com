      <li>, I thought my skin looked so much better.</li>

      <li>Everyone would say, my skin looked fine.</li>
      <li>I am also a huge fan of reviews</li>
      <li>I started with this system again and I can honestly say that it has made my skin much clearer and my pore size has reduced.</li>
      <li>During the day, I use a light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Last week, my mother commented:  \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe how great your skin looks!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I was on the verge of using accutane, one of the most powerful acne medications until my friend told me about this product.  </li>
      <li>After reading how the Clenziderm skin systems treats the root of the problem, I said its worth a try!  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased so far with the Clenziderm.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in shock and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
      <li>My pores seem to be getting smaller and my skin is more bright not dull!</li>
      <li>some of the other reviewers experienced.  </li>
      <li>I have had acne troubles for many years and have been on accutane 3 times as well as antibiotics and many topical treatments.</li>
      <li>I saw results within the first week!  </li>
      <li>Its very smooth and soft now.</li>
      <li>Well it was worth every dollar because after one week my cluster of bumps on my forehead disappeared.</li>
      <li>So I gave it a shot, and found it was definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>so I only use it at night with a gentle cleanser and a good moisterizer in the morning.</li>
      <li>I think its totally worth it.    </li>
      <li>I think this system is definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>BUT, at first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the product or just that my skin is usually better in the summer; however, once I ran out and tried something else for a few weeks, I could tell a huge difference.</li>
      <li>so I was searching for the right wash.  </li>
      <li>I am a big fan of multiple step systems and I feel that they are the most effective treatment for all with acne.</li>
      <li>If you stick with it, you older skin will shed off and new better looking skin will emerge.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product for those of you who have oily skin and this product will help clear up the acne and will help to prevent future break outs and will also help with oil control.</li>
      <li>I bought this product after trying MANY MANY different types of ...over the counters creams, cleansers, spot treatments etc... and prescription drugs such as antibiotics.</li>
      <li>unfortunately no.</li>
      <li>and this is the first thing I can say works</li>
      <li>At first I did not like the smell or the tingling and burning sensation on my face</li>
      <li>I did have to rinse off some areas of the BP from my face the first night (cheekbones) b/c of a burning feeling</li>
      <li>Since Newderm did something better than my topical perscriptions I thought why not try this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many prescription medication &amp; lately haven&#x27;t been satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I use the whole system at night and wash in the morning with Clean and Clear Continuous Acne wash which is very gentle.</li>
      <li>They both said the type of benzoyl peroxide used in this product is far superior as gets down deeper into the pours and doesn&#x27;t sit on the top layer of the skin like other treatments.</li>
      <li>Six months later, my skin was clear, and my cheeks were smooth for the first time in 20 years!      </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I have ever had anything that has worked so well and so fast.</li>
      <li>Pro-Active worked okay for a while, but my cheeks were still rough with under-the-skin pimples.  </li>
      <li>but now I apply more carefully.</li>
      <li>I used Obagi Clenziderm at the very beginning of my cystic acne development and it worked wonders until my skin built up a tolerance to it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup</li>
      <li>For the price you would think you were getting some nice botanicals in there like green tea or pomegranate, but</li>
      <li>I learned about this product at a medspa, but they wanted almost double the price, so I was excited to see it here.  </li>
      <li>She seems to spend about 20 minutes each wash with this product, which is more than other products.  </li>
      <li>I had high expectations as I do with every product I try but this one really works</li>
      <li>Obagi cleared my face so much that I rarely get breakouts and when I do get them, they are not the same anymore,they&#x27;re not cystic and heals really really fast.</li>
      <li>I have always had very oily skin, and that&#x27;s why I chose the normal to oily Clenziderm.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is nice and leaves your skin soft and tight, but the menthol in it burns the eyes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;ve had a problem with acne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started getting acne at age 14 when I was in High School</li>
      <li>I always tried to keep my face clear, but couldn&#x27;t get much improvement.  </li>
      <li>STARTER SETS - Normal to Oily</li>
      <li>Overall, it serves the purpose of preventing pimples, but I do not believe that it is worth the money at all.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try, especially for those with oily skin.</li>
      <li>then I switched to Obagi C-Rx which also worked wonders and picked up right where the Clenziderm left off.</li>
      <li>The product describes as 2009 brand new.</li>
      <li>This product not only burned and turned my face beet red -- it caused 3 huge cystic acne bumps.  </li>
      <li>I was previously using Proactiv with fair results, but it was the only regimen outside of accutane that helped.</li>
      <li>The Clenziderm system doesn&#x27;t necessarily treat pimples, but it does prevent new pimples pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I started using it and my acne started to clear up within a week!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen more results in the last two weeks of using this product than all other stuff combined.</li>
      <li>I used the products twice daily at first.  </li>
      <li>I do think this product was worth the money and that it will last a decent amount of time if only used once a day.</li>
      <li>and my face is completely clear.</li>
      <li>I tried this and in 2 weeks I&#x27;ve never looked so clear.  </li>
      <li>and now I am 26 years old.</li>
      <li>Let me just start off by saying that I am 29 years old and have suffered from acne for years.</li>
      <li>Iam 47 years old and still breaking out</li>
      <li>However the product expiration dates weren&#x27;t as far as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t ask your husband to check out how smooth your skin is everyday.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells like chemicals, and really that&#x27;s the only thing in it.</li>
      <li>I have had acne my whole life and now in my mid 30&#x27;s.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is very good if you have acne. I have been using it for a couple of years now. Very good for all skin types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started getting acne at age 14 when I was in High School and it&#x27;s been a recurring problem ever since. I&#x27;m going on 23 now. I tried almost every acne treatment in stores and nothing seemed to work. Proactiv seemed to work for a short period, but I&#x27;m guessing my skin got used to that product because after a short period of time, I began breaking out again. So, I finally decided to see a dermatologist for my acne problem and he recommended clenziderm. I started using it and my acne started to clear up within a week! I have oily skin, so he recommended the \\&quot;normal to oily skin\\&quot; step system, BUT he replaced the 3rd step from the \\&quot;normal to oily skin\\&quot; system, and gave me the 2nd step from the \\&quot;dry to normal\\&quot; skin step system. The only problem was that it did dry out my skin after the first week, and my skin began to get a little red and flakey. If this happends just decrease the dosage and it&#x27;ll be fine. I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;ve had a problem with acne. It is a little pricey, but its worth it!</li>
    <li> Ok I have suffered from acne since I was 21 and now I am 26 years old. I tried EVERYTING you can possibly try to clear up acne. I tried all the mall department store ance treatments I tried PROACTIVE, nothing comes close to this Obagi Acne Treatment. I use this for two months then I switch to another DR prescribed ance treatment, I reccommend this acne treatment for people who have tried everything they could to get rid of acne. This is a good product for those of you who have oily skin and this product will help clear up the acne and will help to prevent future break outs and will also help with oil control. I am 26 years old and my skin is flawless thanks to Obagi, I used it faithfully like the doctor advised me to do and the results are amazing. I have used it for over a year and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since my teens, and upon turning 40, wondered \\&quot;how can I still be dealing with acne at this age??\\&quot;  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried everything from over-the-counter products to Retin-A, Differin, etc.  Retin-A caused my face to peel, and some of the other products bleached my face.  Pro-Active worked okay for a while, but my cheeks were still rough with under-the-skin pimples.  I started to wonder whether I had rosacea instead of acne and tried prescriptions for that too!  Finally, I decided to scour the internet and find something new to try, regardless of the cost.      Thats when I found the Obagi system.  The products received good reviews, so I decided to give them a try.  I used the products twice daily at first.  I have super-oily skin, so I did not experience the dryness some of the other reviewers experienced.  I saw results within the first week!  After a month or so, I started using the products once a day, alternating with an antibacterial soap in the evening.  Six months later, my skin was clear, and my cheeks were smooth for the first time in 20 years!      Last week, my mother commented:  \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe how great your skin looks!\\&quot;  Honesty, I can&#x27;t believe it either!  This system worked for me when nothing else did.</li>
    <li> Hi Viewers,    Upon turning 40 yrs. of age, I started noticing the annoying adult acne resurfacing and it drove me crazy. My forehead had a cluster of fine bumps and sporadic zits just kept popping up on my face.  Everyone would say, my skin looked fine. But when I felt my skin and noticed this problem, I had to do something about it. So I rediscovered this product name at a doctors office and decided to do some research. So I went to the Obagi &amp; Amazon website and after reading the info. &amp; reviews, I decided to give it a try. After reading how the Clenziderm skin systems treats the root of the problem, I said its worth a try!  Well it was worth every dollar because after one week my cluster of bumps on my forehead disappeared. Seriously, I can see and feel a difference in my skin. Its very smooth and soft now. It can dry your face out a bit. So I just use this product once a day instead of using day and night.     So, if you are experiencing annoying breakouts, give this product a try. Like I said it does work!  And if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, at least with Amazon you can return the item and get your money back!    But I am a glowing and happy camper!!! :)</li>
    <li> This product not only burned and turned my face beet red -- it caused 3 huge cystic acne bumps.  We&#x27;ve always been told that alcohol is bad for the skin and yet these products contain most of the ingredients that we&#x27;re told to avoid.  I dont understand why dermatologists sell these products but it was a complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner. However the product expiration dates weren&#x27;t as far as I had hoped. The product describes as 2009 brand new. So I assumed that it was produce for 2009, where the product would have a longer life span a few years later. But it was actually expired in 2009. Overall, product was in new condition, as described.</li>
    <li> I am also a huge fan of reviews so I hope this helps someone! I just received this product and started using it 2 days ago. I have had acne troubles for many years and have been on accutane 3 times as well as antibiotics and many topical treatments. I was previously using Proactiv with fair results, but it was the only regimen outside of accutane that helped. I have always had very oily skin, and that&#x27;s why I chose the normal to oily Clenziderm. I wanted to try the Nuderm line but it was more expensive and didn&#x27;t seem like it would target my acne. I am a big fan of multiple step systems and I feel that they are the most effective treatment for all with acne. I am very pleased so far with the Clenziderm. It leaves my skin dry, but that is nothing new to me. I use the whole system at night and wash in the morning with Clean and Clear Continuous Acne wash which is very gentle. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup but I think I might continue using my Proactiv oil control under my make-up, just to have some protection on in the day time. It has reduced my pore size already and I can tell an improvement in my skin tone. My only negative comment is that it makes my skin very dry, however I would rather have dry skin that I can moisturize opposed to oily skin that I can&#x27;t control. I try to use as little moisturizer as possible since it has always made my skin oily and break out (even the oil free ones).  The smell of the product is nothing to complain about; the last step smells the least attractive, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that bad. I do think this product was worth the money and that it will last a decent amount of time if only used once a day. When I run out I might switch to the normal to dry system, but I will definitely stay with Clenziderm and throw out all of my old products. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try, especially for those with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I was on the verge of using accutane, one of the most powerful acne medications until my friend told me about this product.  It saved my skin.  I haven&#x27;t had a pimple since using this.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for 5 weeks. I have hormonal acne and I noticed clearer skin in 2 weeks. I forgot to use it one night and the next day I had a big zit on my chin. It is almost gone in 2 days though.  My pores seem to be getting smaller and my skin is more bright not dull! I had high expectations as I do with every product I try but this one really works and I&#x27;m suprised. At first I did not like the smell or the tingling and burning sensation on my face but I stuck with it and so happy I did.  I have ordered the rest of the obagi system because I have heard great things about it and now I trust the brand. You should try this product.Beautiful clear skin is worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> I had occasional breakouts on my cheeks, forehead, and chin before starting this product.  The Clenziderm system doesn&#x27;t necessarily treat pimples, but it does prevent new pimples pretty well.  However, it made my previously oily skin very dry; my skin went from one extreme to another.  I have rough patches on my cheeks, and I have to slather on moisturizer just to soothe my skin.  The texture of my skin has changed dramatically.  Overall, it serves the purpose of preventing pimples, but I do not believe that it is worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> I am SO glad I gave this product a try.  Like others, I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have always had acne, despite trying hard to clear it.  I always tried to keep my face clear, but couldn&#x27;t get much improvement.  I did notice within a day that my face started to improve.  Now, I&#x27;m to 2 weeks, and have just one breakout on my face.      My husband noticed after a week that my skin was looking better.  He wondered what I was doing, and couldn&#x27;t believe how well this product was working.  I use all 3 products just before bed, and dab on the #3 serum in the morning on anything \\&quot;trying\\&quot; to break out.    I learned about this product at a medspa, but they wanted almost double the price, so I was excited to see it here.  I think its totally worth it.    For those who say it severely dried out their skin, maybe you don&#x27;t have oily skin like you think you do.  My face is always shiny by afternoon, and this product was great![[ASIN:B003047VBE OBAGI CLENZIderm M.D. (BUY 2) STARTER SETS - Normal to Oily (BUY 2 SETS @ THIS PRICE)]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and suffer adult acne after I stopped taking oral birthcontrol.This is the only acne treatment kit that worked for me and my skin is not that sensitive. I tried the Murad kit and it SCARRED my face with zits (made it worse). Obagi cleared my face so much that I rarely get breakouts and when I do get them, they are not the same anymore,they&#x27;re not cystic and heals really really fast. I alternate it with a milder,drugstore wash and gylcolic acid serum because it will really dry out your face if used everyday. I only use it once a day, every other day. I left one star for the price.</li>
    <li> Pretty expensive but I found a good deal from Amazon.  So far this product has delivered &amp; since I only need to use a small amount at a time it should last a while.  I&#x27;ve used many prescription medication &amp; lately haven&#x27;t been satisfied.  After hearing of this product &amp; doing some online research including reading many reviews I decided to give it a shot.  After the money I had been spending on stuff that didn&#x27;t work what did I have to lose.  Fortunately, nothing!  I&#x27;m pretty happy that I don&#x27;t need to worry about wearing cover-up in the summer time.  Hopefully this product continues to work long-term.  I&#x27;ve only been using it about two months now.  I did have to rinse off some areas of the BP from my face the first night (cheekbones) b/c of a burning feeling but now I apply more carefully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my mild/moderate acne. I&#x27;ve had every over the counter product plus Proactiv with only some relief. I went to a dermotologist and a &#x27;skin care consultant&#x27; and they both recommended this product. They both said the type of benzoyl peroxide used in this product is far superior as gets down deeper into the pours and doesn&#x27;t sit on the top layer of the skin like other treatments. I was hesitant over the price and was doubtful that it would be worth the high cost -- we&#x27;ve all heard the same pitches before! So I gave it a shot, and found it was definitely worth it. It does dry out my skin a lot so I only use it at night with a gentle cleanser and a good moisterizer in the morning.</li>
    <li> I foolishly decided to purchase this product after meeting with an aesthetician that kept raving about this system and convinced me to purchase it.  I have been dealing with acne for at least 10 years and hoped i would grow out of it, but im in my 20&#x27;s and nothing&#x27;s changed.  this system is similar to others that are out there like Proactiv and Neutrogena.  No special ingredients that justify the price either.  The serum gel is the worst part...the pump doesn&#x27;t work and i had to spend extra time every night just trying to get the stuff out of the bottle.  Also it changed consistency and color after a few months and began burning and turned my skin extremely red (I checked and it is not expired so i have to idea what happened)  I DID NOT notice ANY improvement after starting this treatment and I stayed with it for a couple of months, all it did was dry out my skin!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife.  It does a great job against Acne.  Initially, it&#x27;ll dry out your skin and you&#x27;ll need to stay out of the sun.  She reduced the interval a bit due to the dryness.  She seems to spend about 20 minutes each wash with this product, which is more than other products.  If you stick with it, you older skin will shed off and new better looking skin will emerge.  Please don&#x27;t ask your husband to check out how smooth your skin is everyday.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products that has cleared my skin and kept it clear. I know they say it takes a few weeks to see a difference, but the first time that I used it my face felt so much cleaner and within 2 days there was an obvious difference. I will never try anything else!</li>
    <li> OK.....Let me just start off by saying that I am 29 years old and have suffered from acne for years. But as of recently (3yrs) I have developed cystic acne which is only brought on by my cycle or period if you&#x27;d rather. About a week out before I start my cycle I will being to notice very hard and painful knots starting to rise under my skin...I have spent $250/wack on chemical peels which have helped with scarring and hyperpigmentation drastically but never helped long term with the cystic acne. I used Obagi Clenziderm at the very beginning of my cystic acne development and it worked wonders until my skin built up a tolerance to it......then I switched to Obagi C-Rx which also worked wonders and picked up right where the Clenziderm left off. Cleared up the acne scars, hyperpigmentation/uneven skin tone from the acne etc. This system worked for me for a period of 3 months until I switched BACK TO OBAGI CLENZIDERM and I mean to tell you that the big huge knots under my skin are DISSOLVED WITHIN MINUTES with this Obagi Clenziderm kit, I would suggest with someone that has my skin type to use it two weeks prior to any hormal changes such as a period or guys going through puberty etc. I would then use the Obagi C-Rx system 2 weeks after that with ONE USE of the Obagi Clenziderm mid-week for two weeks and then right back on it for a solid two weeks. This will help with your skin building up a tolerance with either because you are always changing the \\&quot;stimulus\\&quot; therefore not allowing it to accomdate itself to either product! Hope this helps eventhought its long!</li>
    <li> I have had acne my whole life and now in my mid 30&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve tried every topical perscription and antibiotic but don&#x27;t want to put pills in my body anymore so I was searching for the right wash.  I never felt like the topical perscriptions being written for me were working and every doctor kept telling me to take accutane which I refuse.  A long time ago I tried Nuderm by Obaji.  It was ok but didn&#x27;t fully do the job.  I knew others where Nuderm did the job.  Since Newderm did something better than my topical perscriptions I thought why not try this.  I tried this and in 2 weeks I&#x27;ve never looked so clear.  The last time I looked this way I was on an antibiotic.  I have ordered every acne wash, gel, etc and constantly go to the dermo and this is the first thing I can say works and I&#x27;m actually taking the time to write about it.  I&#x27;m in shock and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  Yes, it felt a bit weird on my face in the beginning and I peeled but what acne stuff doesn&#x27;t do that.  Get through that and you&#x27;ll look your best.  Definitely use this system.  Only use #3 at night.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like chemicals, and really that&#x27;s the only thing in it. The cleanser is nice and leaves your skin soft and tight, but the menthol in it burns the eyes. The serum and pore toner stink, literally. I have oily skin, and they dry my skin out horribly and burn when you put them on. They have left my skin red and dry like other benzoyl peroxide treatments. For the price you would think you were getting some nice botanicals in there like green tea or pomegranate, but unfortunately no. This stuff works like any other over the counter acne treatment, only difference is the price is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when I was visiting a friend and complimented on how beautiful her skin looked. She told me that she got this stuff, and had been using it for quite some time. She decided to buy it after seeing how well it worked for room mate and her step mother. I&#x27;ve had really stubborn acne for a past couple months, trying all sorts of expensive facials and o.t.c. creams and things. Nothing seemed to work. I&#x27;ve seen more results in the last two weeks of using this product than all other stuff combined. Sure it&#x27;s expensive, but it works. You also don&#x27;t need to use alot at a time, or even every day. This kit will last months. Some people have commented on how dry it makes your skin. For me, that was only for two nights of really dried out skin. During the day, I use a light moisturizer. If you&#x27;re on the fence and feel like you&#x27;ve \\&quot;tried everything,\\&quot; definitely give this a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after trying MANY MANY different types of ...over the counters creams, cleansers, spot treatments etc... and prescription drugs such as antibiotics. I have been battling acne for 15 years. Iam 47 years old and still breaking out so you can imagine my frustration. I began using this product and within 5 days all of my acne was healing nicely. I have been using night and day for three weeks and my face is completely clear. I don&#x27;t think I have ever had anything that has worked so well and so fast. I only gave it 4 stars because I did have a problem with the pump on serum bottle. Its stopped working almost immediately so I have to use a Q-tip stick it down in the bottle to get it out. I also noticed that opening the bottle to put Qtip in has exposed the product to air which has made it turn to a grainy texture. Obagi seriously needs to fix this problem because with the cost of this product you expect it to work properly. I am afraid that when I get down to the end of serum I won&#x27;t be able to get it out. It is really thick and won&#x27;t move down to the opening even with turning the bottle upside down. Otherwise I am so impressed with how well this product has been working for me. I have not noticed my skin getting so dry as others have said and I am using twice daily. I also use obagi new-derm clear with this to help fade red marks and dark spot this is another obagi product that I love. It is expensive but I will continue to buy as long as it continues to work this well. Clear skin mean everything to me.</li>
    <li> Great results! I think this system is definitely worth trying. I initally bought some from my dermatolgist this summer because they were having a sale and after using it for just a few weeks, I thought my skin looked so much better. BUT, at first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the product or just that my skin is usually better in the summer; however, once I ran out and tried something else for a few weeks, I could tell a huge difference. I started with this system again and I can honestly say that it has made my skin much clearer and my pore size has reduced. It also has drastically reduced any PMS breakouts. I know that when you have bad skin, you try everything and I know this is a little more expensive, but I really feel it has worked wonders for me. My tips: I usually apply a moisturizer at night after step 3 has dried and I only use step 3 in the evening.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3-4 weeks since I&#x27;ve used the product and its been great so far, I&#x27;ve only had a few small new pimples and most of what I had is under control and slowly fading away. The product is extremely drying and need to moisturize during the day. Excellent for someone who has flared acne and wants something strong to get it under control.</li>
