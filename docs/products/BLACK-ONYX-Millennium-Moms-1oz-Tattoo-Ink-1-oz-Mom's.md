<li> Not real moms ink</li>
<li> ...heals dark and stays dark..</li>
<li> This ink came in a very decent sized bottle however it is extremely thick it makes seeing the outline of the tattoo very hard</li>
<li> Ink holds well in my skin at least, very dark black.</li>
<li> a little hard to wipe off</li>
<li> Not a very good buy at all.</li>
<li> I mean, I&#x27;ll take it, but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Might</li>
<li> Fake.</li>
