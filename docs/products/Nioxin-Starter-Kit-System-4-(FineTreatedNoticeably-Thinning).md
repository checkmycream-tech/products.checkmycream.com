      <li>I bought this stuff and from the very first use, my hair felt thick and beautiful again!  </li>
      <li>and at first it seems to work fine.</li>

      <li>I enjoyed the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was left very clean, and with a shine.</li>
      <li>but it is not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>and my hair is super dry even if I use good conditioner and serum.</li>
      <li>I have tried many things and this is the first time I have seen real results.</li>
      <li>Seller is fantastic and received item fast in the mail...</li>

      <li>Keeping optimistic because other reviews have been good regarding this product.</li>

      <li>I will also write a review there as a \\&quot;confirmed Amazon purchase\\&quot; so that people know my review is accurate and that I honestly use the products.and then smoothed over my head starting at the back and ends first.  </li>
      <li>The main improvement I noticed is that it slowed the shedding of hair significantly.  </li>
      <li>I received this product very fast.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for over 6 weeks and started to see improvements since the first week.  </li>

      <li>so it&#x27;s been over a month since I&#x27;ve started using this &amp; at first I was using it every day as the instructions said to.</li>
      <li>and I had to order it thru her, but I found it on Amazon.com at a reasonable price!  </li>
      <li>My hair has much more body as it did when I was younger.  </li>
      <li>Seems gentle, no odor, hopefully my scalp responds!</li>
      <li>Nioxon is a great product, I wash my hair once a week, I&#x27;ve used it four times so far, and I&#x27;m see less hair in my comb and sink.</li>
      <li>I got a great price online, but I think the shipping was too high, for what I paid altogether, I could have bought it from a local salon and had the kit the same day.</li>
      <li>Nioxin is the best system I have ever found for my very thin hair.</li>
      <li>The smell is not unpleasant, and I have a very sensitive nose.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The box came crushed (oh well, we can get past that). But, the items weren&#x27;t full. They were either used already or old bottles half filled from something else. Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> My scalp become irritated and caused serious flaking. After 2 months, Nioxin worsens the problem and my hair is thinning even more.   My hair is thinning even more after I started to use Nioxin.The flaking is horrible too.       Now I have two problems. Thinning hair and serious flaking. :(</li>
    <li> This changed my hair and my life! :-) Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 6 weeks and started to see improvements since the first week.  The main improvement I noticed is that it slowed the shedding of hair significantly.  After 4-5 weeks I noticed increasing shedding, but it slowed again.  This should be due to the natural hair growing cycle.  Also the treatment foam helps give body and make hair looks thicker making styling my hair a lot easier.  A friend had recommended this product and so far is performing as I expected.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this to me because I had lost a LOT of hair due to menopause because also from some medication I use.  I&#x27;ve been using it since late November and have new growth all over my scalp.  I have recommended it to my mother to use as well.  I don&#x27;t find the scent unpleasant although it&#x27;s not pretty like other shampoos/conditioners.  But that&#x27;s okay, that&#x27;s what I use perfume for!  Now that I&#x27;m used to how my hair behaves with the scalp treatment, I find styling much easier.  It almost doubles as a styling gel but since I don&#x27;t like the wet look, I brush it when dry for a softer look and feel.  I recently purchased the scalp treatment separately as I find when using the kit, that I still have plenty of shampoo and conditioner.  Try it!  It may work as well for you!</li>
    <li> Nioxin is the best system I have ever found for my very thin hair. I have tried many things and this is the first time I have seen real results. I have only used it for about 3 weeks and I can see new growth plus the rest of my hair appears thicker. Nioxin is very expensive so this starter kit is a wonderful bargain. I would advise anyone with my hair type to try it!!</li>
    <li> These items typically come in a package, but these came separately and looked old and used.  More importantly, the small pump has no instructions (they were probably on the box) so I don&#x27;t know how to use it.  Because the shampoo and conditioner are in tubes, there is no way to tell if these products were used when sold.  This is a low-budget seller. WILL NOT PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Nioxin is probably the best product for thinning hair. It is important to get the kit - the 3 items together make it work so wel</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my daughter who at a young age has very thinning hair and it works.  It is a little costly but worth it.</li>
    <li> I love these products. My hair loss is less and my hair is growing faster. I also take the Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex and my nails are growing and much stronger!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give negative stars!! This product did the opposite of what it was supposed to!! It damaged and broke my poor hair!!!</li>
    <li> This product works well in stopping hair loss.  I will be purchasing it again online, because the price is so much better that in the salons or grocery stores.  Great for thinning hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks. I can&#x27;t tell if it grows hair or just makes the hair you have look fuller. All I know is that my hair was recently damaged due to chemicals. I had a huge bald spot on top and the sides were thinning. Now, the spot is gone and the sides are coming in, too. In fact, I can&#x27;t even make a part in my hair because it&#x27;s so much hair in the way. I have only used the shampoo &amp; conditioner 3 times so far, but I use the scalp treatment foam everyday. The shampoo has a minty, herbal scent to it. By the way, I bought this whole starter kit on eBay for $30, inclu. shipping.</li>
    <li> Products like this for hair loss seem to be on the pricey side, so I wanted to try this one out before spending a lot of money on the full size versions. I give the Cleanser (shampoo) and the Scalp Therapy (conditioner) high marks.  The smell is not unpleasant, and I have a very sensitive nose.  Whether or not they are helping my hair, I can&#x27;t say for sure yet.  It is a trial size and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks.  But my hair seems healthy and soft.  Definitely no worse off than it was before and maybe shedding a little less.     The only product in the package I didn&#x27;t like was the Scalp Treatment which is like a leave in conditioner.  It made my roots very stiff and almost sticky.  Horrible feel and did not brush out easily.    I plan on buying the full size of the Cleanser and the Scalp Therapy in the hope that continued use will bring even more benefit.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY HAIR DRESSER BECAUSE MY  HAIR WAS THINING -  RESULTS WERE IN THREE WEEKS - DON&#x27;T HESITATE - THIS   STUFF IS GOOD  [[ASIN:B00138Y0RM Nioxin Starter Kit, System 4 (Fine/Treated/Noticeably Thinning)]]</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recomended Nioxin to me since my hair was breaking and thinning after hitting menopause. I had tried Rogaine for women and it made my hair break faster which was frightening. I love the results I&#x27;ve gotten with Nioxin and I recomend it to any woman to try. My hair is healthy, the natural color is much better, and I only have normal breakage. It smells herbal but it is not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Just could not use this product because I had an allergic reaction to it.  Although I did not get the product in my eyes, they were burning and swollen in the morning.  Tried it for a few days and then discarded it.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference between this and a $2 shampoo and conditioner. Very disappointed, considering Nioxin&#x27;s reputable name. Save your money and your time and buy something that you know smells good instead.</li>
    <li> I recently noticed thinning hair in the front of my head. From all of the information I gathered on the internet it would appear that when you notice thinning hair you need to act fast because the hair follicles reach a point where hair growth will not return back to those spots. I purchased Nioxin Starter Kit 4 because this suits my hair type. If you go to the company website they have a nice little interactive tool that will ask you questions and then from your answers  recommend the correct system for you. I recommend this tool because even though the starter kit is reasonably priced, the actual full sizes bottles can be pricey. I enjoyed the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was left very clean, and with a shine. I found that I didn&#x27;t have to add my usual conditioning sprays that I normally add after I condition my hair.  As for the scalp treatment I found that it made my hair very hard, thus not easily able to comb through. Perhaps I used to much, but it seems like I got just as much in the hair as I did on my  the scalp trying to put it on. I guess you need to have a technique for application. I believe the main component in the scalp treatment is a sun screen, so given how it made my hair and the fact that I&#x27;m not totally sold on the need to have sun protectant on my scalp I&#x27;m just gonna let it sit in the back of my closet until I have more time to research it&#x27;s uses and more time to practice with it. All in all a good buy for a starter kit and hopefully I&#x27;m well on my way to maintaining my hair line.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I could not use the scalp treatment on an everday basis because it had my hair feeling very stiff.  The shampoo and conditioner did nothing for my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me. Made my hair more fragile and dull.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that this stuff is amazing.  Due to the stress of finding out that my husband was having an affair, I lost a lot of weight that I didn&#x27;t need to lose...and a lot of hair.  My hair used to be so thick, and now it&#x27;s not at all.  I started taking the vitamin Biotin which has helped my hair to stop falling out, however it&#x27;s still thin.  I bought this stuff and from the very first use, my hair felt thick and beautiful again!  It&#x27;s expensive, unfortunately, but worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> The product left my hair dry and flat.  My scalp become irritated and caused serious flaking.</li>
    <li> Nioxon is a great product, I wash my hair once a week, I&#x27;ve used it four times so far, and I&#x27;m see less hair in my comb and sink. My hair feels and look healthier already. I will continue to use nioxon.   I got a great price online, but I think the shipping was too high, for what I paid altogether, I could have bought it from a local salon and had the kit the same day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month. It does make the hair appear thicker. I do notice this which is a relief. The jury is still out on whether or not it is actully repairing hair. I think it is more of a cosmetic effect.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism last summer and started to notice a difference in the texture of my hair.  My doctor also recently diagnosed me with a Vitamin B deficinency, not sure if it is part of the thyroid problem or from taking Synthroid but my hair was starting to thin and break easily.  I began dreading showering and shampooing since handfuls of my hair would fall out in the shower and then during my comb-out, we are talking 100&#x27;s of hairs.  I even had about 5 inches cut off the length hoping to make it seem fuller.  After much research I decided to purchase the Nioxin System 4 products, I am so glad that I did.  My hair feels and looks thicker and my scalp is so clean.  I love the tingling sensation from the products, you can really feel the blood rushing to your scalp.  I also like the smell, it reminds me of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner and I have been getting comments on how good my hair smells.  Since I started using the products I have little (less than 5) to no hair loss in the shower and about 5-10 hairs during my comb-out afterwards.  This is a huge difference between the handfuls of hair that would come out prior to using. My hair has also stopped breaking and is no longer feeling like brittle straw, it is so soft to the touch...even after blowing it dry (which is something that I had stopped doing altogether). I have also been using the Nioxin Follicle Treatment along the front on my hair line, I felt that the thinning was most noticable here and have also tried the Nioxin Root Lifter, Thickening Spray and Finishing Creme.  I used the Root Lifter and Thickening Spray prior to blow out and it gives me great volume, I then take my curling iron and curl the ends inward to frame my face and smooth out any cowlicks and my \\&quot;horns\\&quot; (little cowlicks that I have at my temples that when untamed make my me look like I have little devil horns).  To finish I took just a pea sized dollup of Finishing Creme and rubbed it between my hands and then smoothed over my head starting at the back and ends first.  I use the finishing creme since I live on the Gulf of Mexico and humidity is somthing we deal with 24/7/365.  I am so pleased with these products and highly recommend.  After using the starter system (which I purchased for retail at a salon), I purchased from Amazon the liter bottles of the cleanser and conditioner, the price was insanely low (over 40% off retail).  I will also write a review there as a \\&quot;confirmed Amazon purchase\\&quot; so that people know my review is accurate and that I honestly use the products.and then smoothed over my head starting at the back and ends first.

    <li> Does this really promote new hair growth?  Or does it just make your hair LOOK thicker?  Either way, it definitely improves the look of my thinning hair.  I have been using the product for about a month now and I do see a difference.  I hate the smell of the stuff and my hair feels dry and a little coarse, BUT it looks thicker than it has in years.  I plan to keep using it for a while longer before making my final decision on its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Nioxin has made a noticeable difference in my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I was having problems with breakage and now that&#x27;s all gone!  I would recommend trying it for at least 6 months to really make a difference.</li>
    <li> I decided to try it and at first it seems to work fine. I like the smell. But after I used it for a couple weeks, I noticed my hair started to falling out easily and my hair is super dry even if I use good conditioner and serum. And I might be allegic to ingredient too cause my scalp has red bumps all over and it&#x27;s itchy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for a week now and my hair doesn&#x27;t falling out that much anymore and there&#x27;s no more bumps on my scalp!!</li>
    <li> I am a gastric by-pass patient and after a year of literally eating nothing and drinking only water my hair was falling out.  The bang area was almost non-existant.  I started using Nioxin and within several months my hair was starting to grow back in and the hair that I still had was stronger.  Just recently I noticed my hair was starting to break and it was looking noticably thinner.  I again purchased Nioxin and am very pleased to say that I am already noticing the change. I am using the System 4 kit and my dyed hair is retaining its color.  My hat is off to NIOXIN!</li>
    <li> I have very thin fine hair, especially in the front.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two months, and I already see a difference.  My hair is shinier, healthier, and more hair is growing.</li>
    <li> The product has a wonderful smell.  However, I did not notice any difference with my hair, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Terrible .I think that it&#x27;s old product . It was manufactured in a plant that no longer exists because Nioxin moved its corporate plant elsewhere according to my Internet search.  The products came in a dented cardboard box without shipping receipt. Very unprofessional looking.The shampoo is very  drying and the other components of the starter kit made my hair so brittle it felt like the hair was going to break off.I think that I should receive a full refund.</li>
    <li> Great product saw immediate results ! Dosent really regrow hair but stopped it from falling out and also have thickness and volume .</li>
    <li> Everything arrived as expected</li>
    <li> Nioxin really seemed to Halt&amp;#34; my hair loss. Also makes your hair appear to be slightly thicker.I would have given it  five stars however it does make it difficult to comb thru hair after using the foam for scalp treatment cause hair is very dry.....that being said; I love the fact that I&#x27;m not losing anymore hair !</li>
    <li> This product combo has improved the texture and &amp;#34;stylability&amp;#34; of my fine and thinning hair. There is no doubt that my hair is soft and healthier feeling.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this stuff and swears by it so I keep buying it for her.  I don&#x27;t know if it protects her hair but she thinks it does.</li>
    <li> This item is fantastic, and at the price here on Amazon just makes it even better. Seller is fantastic and received item fast in the mail...</li>
    <li> I bought this set of Nioxin system 4 due to the generally good reviews that I read. However, I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in the Scalp Treatment part of this system. I just started using the system today so I can&#x27;t say whether it helps with hair growth. What I can say is that the Scalp Treatment feels like the worst kind of hair spray once it&#x27;s in your hair. I let it sit in my hair anyway and tried to style it -- hah! My hair looked and felt like straw! No kidding. Maybe the shampoo and scalp conditioner do what they say, but the Scalp Treatment puts a thick glue-like coating on your hair that just doesn&#x27;t get any better after trying to work with it. I had to re-wash my hair and start over. DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!!! I love it. I am 57 and was considering buying a wig my hair&lt;br /&gt;was thinning so bad. A friend told me to buy Nioxin, system 4. I have been&lt;br /&gt;using it daily for about 2 1/2 weeks now and I have new hair growth. I recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Wrote a review for #2 Starter kit.  Please refer to that review.  These are great to try this product.  You will see results.</li>
    <li> There are so many products on Amazon that are superior to this one at better prices. This is so-so, but nothing to rave over. Would not reorder</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I&#x27;m using it to help prevent hair loss from some surgery I&#x27;ve had.  It smells great. I will keep using it indefinitly.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see the results I had hoped for when I purchased this product. It was a little expensive so I was hopeful but it wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought. Maybe it would be good for someone who didn&#x27;t have hormonal issues that caused the thinning.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels after using this product.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a growth increase, but i&#x27;ve only been using it 10 days, but i do notice a difference in how my hair looks and feels, and it definitely looks fuller.  The product came as promised and in the time promised.  Unfortunately it was frozen in my outdoor mailbox (Minnesota) but defrosted quickly.  :)</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the experience and the product I would recommend to friends and family and any one I could</li>
    <li> I purchased this product package from COSTSELL and after my first use, broke out in hives all over my body. I tried it several more times and each time the rash would show up in a different place. While this may just be my own body&#x27;s personal reaction to the product and it may work for other people, COSTSELL was very unpleasant about refunding my money. I contacted the seller to return and they flat out denied me, saying they apologize I did not \\&quot;get the results that I was looking for\\&quot;. Having the Nioxin system work on thinning hair and breaking out in a rash are two completely different things- I am very disappointed that after spending over 70 dollars, I am unable to get any of my money back whatsoever. I will definitely not be purchasing anything from this seller again.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It leaves hair feeling thicker but too soon to tell if permanent improvement.  The leave in foam is good.</li>
    <li> Love the Nioxin system.  My hair always looks thicker than it is and styles really well.  Been using this now for a little while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice now and have seen a difference. I lost a lot of hair after having my son and this has brought back life to my hair. I have tons of new hair. I love the way it smells and and the minty cooling sensation on my scalp.</li>
    <li> OK... I just got this today and the cleanser (shampoo) is larger than the conditioning treatment, so that was a little surprising. Maybe because it&#x27;s just a starter kit? The product came perfectly packaged so there were no issues with that. I literally just used the products and was worried about the \\&quot;horrible smell\\&quot; people were saying that it had. Unless you hate the smell of mint, it does NOT smell horrible. It tingled and made my scalp feel cool and refreshed. I followed the instructions to the T and I can actually see a slight difference in my hair already! It still feels soft like baby hair, but it&#x27;s definitely got a bit of body to it. I plan on following the steps on a daily basis and will report back with results in a month. (It says it&#x27;s guaranteed results in 30 days.) I&#x27;m really hoping this works for me. I had a double organ transplant almost 4 years ago and the pills I have to take to suppress my immune system have seriously thinned out my hair. Extensions were getting waaaay too expensive and I&#x27;ve tried every other product out there. Keeping my fingers crossed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so it&#x27;s been over a month since I&#x27;ve started using this &amp; at first I was using it every day as the instructions said to. I had excellent results. My mother flew in from out of state &amp; was so amazed by the results that she bought me the entire (full sized) line for my birthday. Istopped washing my hair every day &amp; I&#x27;ve gone back to flat lifeless hair. So as long as you&#x27;re willing to keep up with the routine every single day, you&#x27;re sure to see excellent results. Also, it does seem to dry out your hair, but my stylist recommended I use my regular conditioner every other time I wash. I also deep condition my hair once a week, so that has also made quite the difference. I&#x27;d still recommend this product for DAILY use.</li>
    <li> I am still in the trial phase of this product. I have noticed that after using, when I comb my hair out, not as much hair comes out. This makes me hopeful because my hair is already thin and I have been experiencing hair loss for a few years now. The mfr. stresses the fact that you must use it as described, and I have been using all 3 products according to the directions. Keeping optimistic because other reviews have been good regarding this product.</li>
    <li> Waiting to see if using it for 60-120 days improves my hair regrowth. Seems gentle, no odor, hopefully my scalp responds!</li>
    <li> For me, the Nioxin was a nice shampoo and conditioner in that it cools the scalp.  But, other than giving me the cooling sensation, it didn&#x27;t do anything to actually thicken my hair or prevent hair loss.  Maybe it works for others.  For me, just very expensive for no results.</li>
    <li> Who knew? We are amazed that this product solved the thin hair on tippy top of head!  Worth the price of trying it! Trust me!</li>
    <li> My beautician suggested Nioxin when she noticed the loss of hair at my last appointment. Within a week, hair was growing back. I have not been using dyes or hair gels/sprays either. My head of hair is much fuller now without all the chemicals but with Nioxin shampoo and scalp treatment. My head loves the massages every morning!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to me and I though I&#x27;d like to give it a try. When combing my hair , I have noticed less falling out.  My hair feels and looks thicker.  It also feels soft and not brittle.  It is a very easy system to use.  I am hoping for continued success.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try it b/c my hairdresser said it was expensive and I had to order it thru her, but I found it on Amazon.com at a reasonable price!  The more I used it, the better my hair was.  Less shedding, and lots of body/volume.  I won&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo.  This product has a strong minty almost medicine like smell..it will clear your sinuses.</li>
    <li> The Doctor had prescribed this Shampoo for my Daughter, she was losing her hair by the handfuls everytime she would touch her hair.  She has started using Nioxin and her hair has stopped coming out and has started getting new hair in. Her hair is shiney and healthy looking again.  My Daughter had tried several other hair treatments and had no success with the other treatments until now using the Nioxin 4 .</li>
    <li> Love the way makes my hair look thicker. So far I am very pleased</li>
    <li> I received this product very fast.  I have been struggling with hormonal changes and tons of stress.  I have been using salon quality products however, I can see now if your scalp is not healty then you hair will fall out especially w/stress and hormonal changes.  Using products with synthetic fillers even though salon quality after years is not the best for your scalp.  After only 1 week of this product(s) I see and feel great results.  #1.  Much less hair in the brush and on the floor.  I was actually condering a professional help.  I know that genetics play a part but my grandmother did not have the products as of today.  I will continue using this product.  For now I am very satisfied w/results thus far. #2 My hair has much more body as it did when I was younger.  I would recommend the product to women/men with minimal/thinning and/or hair loss.  I will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the Nioxin System 4 for about 2 weeks.  Admittedly, that probably isn&#x27;t enough time to determine if it&#x27;s going to make a difference in the thickness of my hair, but so far I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days I used it, hair fall was noticeably less.  However, over the past week, my hair is falling out at least as much as it was before I started using Nioxin. When I dry my hair, there is hair everywhere. I&#x27;m not sure why that improved for the first week, but now my hair is falling out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though it isn&#x27;t supposed to strip the color from dyed hair, it most definitely has stripped it out of mine. My hair was a very dark brown (nearly black) when I started using it.  Now it&#x27;s back to the medium auburn brown it was before I dyed it, which I&#x27;m not too happy about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed that my hair looks or feels any different than it did.  I also hate the smell of the Nioxin. It has a minty smell, but not a pleasant mint scent. Instead, it&#x27;s a medicinal minty smell.  I&#x27;m going to use up what I have, but unless I see some improvement, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser and salon suggested this product for my thinning hair. You can literally feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;It will make your scalp tingle in a good way. It will leave your hair feeling so fresh.</li>
