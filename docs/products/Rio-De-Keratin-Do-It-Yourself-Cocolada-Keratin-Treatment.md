      <li>Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
      <li>Nothing has worked as good as this stuff!</li>
      <li>I bought this product a couple of months ago and it worked great.</li>
      <li>It greatly reduces the frizzy, it makes my hair shinier and smoother.</li>
      <li>It would be great if a chemist would verify them.  </li>
      <li>Well it DID do GREAT for my hair.</li>
      <li>I bought the trial size, a great price</li>
      <li>and it looks great.</li>
      <li>and she said it looked like a good product.  </li>
      <li>It smells good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Oh my god, this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>A co-worker recommended this product after she tried it on her own hair</li>
      <li>This is by far the best at home Keratin treatment!</li>
      <li>I have very fine but ringlet-curly, frizz-prone hair.</li>
      <li>I had a friend help me apply it to make sure it was applied evenly and the process was very easy from start to finish.  </li>
      <li>and conditioner smell nice and feel smooth on the hair.</li>
      <li>I figured it was great for her &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; hair and it wouldn&#x27;t do much for mine.</li>
      <li>and i love it ...</li>
      <li>My hair feels better not as frizzy more shine to it.</li>
      <li>Glad I tried it</li>
      <li>The best part was I colored my hair red 2 days before this</li>
      <li>my hair turned out better then when done in the salon.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;As far as the results they turned out great.  </li>
      <li>nice curls underneath but straight frizz on top from the sun.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply too.</li>
      <li>I HAD BEAUTIFUL BLONDE HIGHLIGHTED HAIR AND THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>than I do so I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this treatment.  </li>
      <li>so in a way its buy two get one free for me.</li>
      <li>+ at the salon this product is well worth it!</li>
      <li>With my super fine and shoulder length hair I think I&#x27;ll get 3 uses out of one bottle.</li>
      <li>It made my hair more calm and relaxed, shiny, soft, no frizz and very easy to style.</li>
      <li>My hair accepted styling products more easily and styled better with my flat-iron and curling iron for the 6 weeks following the treatment.</li>
      <li>However, I had a pretty strong reaction to the fumes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the spray that is the actual treatment is hazardous.  </li>
      <li>this is worth a try....  </li>
      <li>Of coarse I live in Maryland which is one the most humid states in the US!</li>
      <li>I was so amazed how straight it still was and thicker feeling too!</li>
      <li>I love this product and will definitely buy this again.  </li>
      <li>still straight!</li>
      <li>So, if you are buying this product based on the claim that it is a safer formaldehyde free alternative, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
      <li>Have used it twice already and will come back for more.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions EXACTLY</li>
      <li>My roots are smooth and straight and my hair is bouncy, shiny, and soft.  </li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply and made my hair frizz free with a slight wave!</li>
      <li>This product claims to be formaldehyde free and uses germaben II as a safe commonly used alternative.</li>
      <li>I really think someone should look into the ingredients.  </li>
      <li>This really works i promise.</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy in some areas, straight in some areas, curly in some areas, and frizzy just about everywhere.</li>
      <li>i didnt even use 1 bottle of the main spray.</li>
      <li>My hair was straight, smooth and shiny when blown out; when I let it dry naturally, the curls were waves and tamed.</li>
      <li>so I had almost 4 inches of new growth.  </li>
      <li>so my hair texture is pretty course and it has been almost 5 months since my last treatment</li>
      <li>It really takes care of frizzy hair and lasts for several months.  </li>
      <li>And to be specific - the fumes were MUCH stronger than when I&#x27;ve gotten this done in the salon.  </li>
      <li>Walked my dog in the early humid morning...</li>
      <li>(she bought it direct off the Rio De Keratin website.  </li>
      <li>After washing it blow dried straight, not its usual huge ball of frizz!!</li>
      <li>i can let my hair air dry for the first time</li>
      <li>my hair is very thick and dry and this made my hair nice and soft and it feels much healthier.  </li>
      <li>For almost 2 months my hair was so soft, no frizz, and although it wasn&#x27;t completely straight, it only took me 10 minutes to run a flat iron through my hair instead of 45 minutes that it would take before i used rio de keratin.</li>
      <li>My hair is dry and very frizzy.</li>
      <li>but it was WAY more manageable and less resistant to styling (cut ironing time down by 1/3).</li>
      <li>Either way, I have enough of the treatment left over for at LEAST 3-4 more applications so at $40.00 (total including shipping) for 4 applications vs. $175</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate.  </li>
      <li>It is like it relaxed the rigid folicle (or something) and really calmed down my hair.  </li>

    <li> I need a lifetime supply of Rio de keratin. It is so easy to apply and made my hair frizz free with a slight wave! I am getting this for all my closest gals! It will make a great Christmas gift!  I received my shipment the same week I ordered. No complaints!!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying when I read the previous reviews and product details I was very excited to try this out.  A little bit of back-round my hair type is 3b curly.  I tend to straighten with a blow-dryer and/or flat iron often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and conditioner smell nice and feel smooth on the hair. HOWEVER...I&#x27;m pretty sure the spray that is the actual treatment is hazardous.  Of course, I know not to spray anywhere close to my face, but I didn&#x27;t have to.  The fumes from spray are so harsh my eyes watered for hours.  It caused me to cough A LOT.  If you do take a chance in buying this product keep your pets away until you finish blow-drying.  I sprayed the chemical in one room and blow-dryed my hair in another. My pet who was a distance away from me...eyes started to water as well.  Didn&#x27;t not expect that.  On the positive,I do see that my hair is slightly less frizzy but I truly warn that the fumes are a big negative and really not worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not here to put the product down but I&#x27;m hoping to warn anyone whose desperate to cure a frizz problem  NOT TO TRY THIS.</li>
    <li> This product claims to be formaldehyde free and uses germaben II as a safe commonly used alternative. However, Germaben II is a preservative that is made up of several different parabens and GIVES ALL FORMALDEHYDE. [...] So, if you are buying this product based on the claim that it is a safer formaldehyde free alternative, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
    <li> This product worked well for the price.  My hair is not as sleek as when I get it done in the salon, but it costs a fraction of the cost so no complaints there.  However, I had a pretty strong reaction to the fumes.  And to be specific - the fumes were MUCH stronger than when I&#x27;ve gotten this done in the salon.  My eyes watered so badly that it was actually running down my cheeks.  During the 24 hour wait period, my lips, nostrils, and eyes got small red bumps around them that felt like they were burning.  And my back - where my hair had touched - also started burning a little.  I really think someone should look into the ingredients.  It would be great if a chemist would verify them.  I&#x27;m not going to do this again.  Oh well, still looking for that perfect hair defrizzing solution!</li>
    <li> My hair feels better not as frizzy more shine to it. I did it by my self it will be easier if you have a friend help you.</li>
    <li> I bought the trial size, a great price and it contains two treatments. My hair was straight, smooth and shiny when blown out; when I let it dry naturally, the curls were waves and tamed.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this product does burn your eyes, but it burns when you have the treatment done in the salon as well.  I love this product and will definitely buy this again.  my hair turned out better then when done in the salon.  my hair is very thick and dry and this made my hair nice and soft and it feels much healthier.  I would recommend this to anyone.  and it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
    <li> Oh my god, this stuff is amazing. Life changing, no joke! I have very fine but ringlet-curly, frizz-prone hair. I did this treatment and left it in for 38 hours. After washing it blow dried straight, not its usual huge ball of frizz!! I was floored. I can let my hair air dry now and it dries to beachy looking waves. With my super fine and shoulder length hair I think I&#x27;ll get 3 uses out of one bottle. I&#x27;ll never be without this stuff now. Just try it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference..WON&#x27;T ever buy hair products on line again</li>
    <li> i am a mixed with mexican. i have black frizzy hair with natural curls. nice curls underneath but straight frizz on top from the sun. i would never go out without my hair straightened and avoided the heat and rain as much as possible IN FLORIDA... This really works i promise. It smells good. I dye my hair (gray hairs) i dyed it 2 days before using it. i have long hair past the center of my back and it is fairly thick. i didnt even use 1 bottle of the main spray. i still have the shampoo and the conditioner too. so in a way its buy two get one free for me. i can let my hair air dry for the first time and it looks great.</li>
    <li> I have thick frizzy dry hair.  I live in a dry climate.  A co-worker recommended this product after she tried it on her own hair (she bought it direct off the Rio De Keratin website.  She has thinner smoother hair than I do so I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this treatment.  I figured it was great for her &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; hair and it wouldn&#x27;t do much for mine. Well it DID do GREAT for my hair. For a $50 treatment - this lasted about 6 weeks. I followed the directions EXACTLY (I think that is key).  It made my hair more calm and relaxed, shiny, soft, no frizz and very easy to style. It is like it relaxed the rigid folicle (or something) and really calmed down my hair.  My hair accepted styling products more easily and styled better with my flat-iron and curling iron for the 6 weeks following the treatment. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it. What it didn&#x27;t do: Straighten.  I still had to use my irons to style it but it was WAY more manageable and less resistant to styling (cut ironing time down by 1/3). I hope this made sense.  I think for $50 this is worth a try....  Glad I tried it and I will again....</li>
    <li> Great product!  It really takes care of frizzy hair and lasts for several months.  Easy to apply too.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I HAD BEAUTIFUL BLONDE HIGHLIGHTED HAIR AND THIS PRODUCT DRIED OUT ALL MY HAIR AND BROKE OFF ALL MY BLONDE HIGHLIGHTS. I WAS FORCED TO DYE MY HAIR BRUNETTE AND ITS BEEN 6 MONTHS LATER AND MY HAIR IS STILL BREAKING OFF AND ALL DRIED OUT. NEVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t change .. still having curly hair .. even though I used 2 bottle and I followed all the steps .. l&#x27;m really disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. Have used it twice already and will come back for more. It lasts just a little bit over 2 months. My hair is dry and very frizzy. During the summer when it&#x27;s humid, I can just forget about it. With this product, I can give my hair a little break from over using flat irons and blow-dryers. It greatly reduces the frizzy, it makes my hair shinier and smoother. I tend to &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; a lot and this also reduces the hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too intense as mentioned here a few times. Actually I smelled nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I had someone helping me with the procedure. We followed the instructions very carefully. It takes about 2 hours. You can&#x27;t rush.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if it lasted longer than 2 months. But with this product, there is no need to go spend $300+ in salons.</li>
    <li> I get keratin treatments in the salon every few months but as I am currently deployed I do not have the salon option.  I emailed this product to my hair stylist in the States before purchasing it and she said it looked like a good product.  I had a friend help me apply it to make sure it was applied evenly and the process was very easy from start to finish.  I am not sure if the ingredients of the treatment have changed but neither myself nor the person helping me had any issues with burning eyes, coughing, etc and we were working in a relatively small (14x6) space with one window which does not fully open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the results they turned out great.  I am African American so my hair texture is pretty course and it has been almost 5 months since my last treatment so I had almost 4 inches of new growth.  My roots are smooth and straight and my hair is bouncy, shiny, and soft.  The results are almost identical to the salon results although I cannot currently vouch for how long they will last.  Either way, I have enough of the treatment left over for at LEAST 3-4 more applications so at $40.00 (total including shipping) for 4 applications vs. $175+ at the salon this product is well worth it!</li>
    <li> Of coarse I live in Maryland which is one the most humid states in the US! With having very frizzy, curly, thin hair, I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;them&amp;#34; all! Nothing has worked as good as this stuff! I left it product in for 36 hours instead of the 24. When I showered with no cap, I wet hair and did not wash it, I just used the conditioner provided and when I blew dry my hair I was so amazed how straight it still was and thicker feeling too! Walked my dog in the early humid morning...still straight! This is by far the best at home Keratin treatment! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of months ago and it worked great. My hair is wavy in some areas, straight in some areas, curly in some areas, and frizzy just about everywhere. For almost 2 months my hair was so soft, no frizz, and although it wasn&#x27;t completely straight, it only took me 10 minutes to run a flat iron through my hair instead of 45 minutes that it would take before i used rio de keratin. The best part was I colored my hair red 2 days before this and it make my hair color last almost 2 months too!!!</li>
    <li> I order 3 and i love it ...</li>
    <li> Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
    <li> the product was time consuming and did not work! I would not buy this product again. False adverstisement for this product.</li>
