      <li>Excellent quality, it looks like a professional wig.</li>

      <li>It worked, and now the wig feels fine!</li>
      <li>They will love dressing up &amp; playing with them😃</li>
      <li>Love this I thought because of the price it would look cheep</li>
      <li>so much better than the children&#x27;s dress up wigs...</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>this seems more for kids heads</li>
      <li>love it soft hair very nice quality wig.</li>
      <li>SUPER DUPER cute.</li>
      <li>nothing like a cheap holloween wig.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wig is admittedly of good quality, however the color is not anywhere near Anna&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I have a 23 1/2 inch head, so I was worried about this fitting right.</li>
      <li>This wig is definitely worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>Soft silky hair with perfect white &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; streak.</li>
      <li>Love the weight and the hair feels almost real.</li>
      <li>And despite other reviews, the wig fits perfectly (the other purchasers probably don&#x27;t know how how to put wigs on; I advise referring to a YouTube video), just make sure to use the hooks!</li>
      <li>The fit is more for an adult</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too!!</li>
      <li>I honesty did not have success with the wig cap, but that was just a bonus with the purchase.  </li>
      <li>The braids are long, and the wig hair net that comes with it is very helpful for getting the wig to look good without having your own hair sticking out the sides.  </li>
      <li>I actually loved the deeper color because when my brown hairline showed through slightly at the bang line, it wasn&#x27;t super glaring.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very full bodied and looks natural.</li>
      <li>It looks super real.</li>
      <li>It is very much like Anna.</li>
      <li>so it shows, but the quality was higher than I expected, and it&#x27;s cute!</li>
      <li>It was exactly what here Anna outfit needed.</li>
      <li>Looks just like the real thing!  </li>
      <li>Overall, for our uses, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>they looked odd but the braids were cute!</li>
      <li>I can barely get it to fit over my whole head.</li>
      <li>Adjustable size, fits a large (child&#x27;s) head.</li>
      <li>The wig fits my 9-year-old very well.</li>
      <li>My daughter dresses like Anna and is highly entertained!</li>
      <li>looks like real hair...</li>
      <li>maybe it could pass as a very brown-auburn.  </li>
      <li>It looks soo real</li>
      <li>The bangs didn&#x27;t really work for me...</li>
      <li>The actual quality of the wig is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is soft and pretty.</li>
      <li>is 7 and it fit her head with no problem not too small or big really cute on her</li>
      <li>There was several people that thought it was my real hair!!</li>
      <li>It does fit a little different than you may expect, more on the back of the head.  </li>
      <li>I does have the little white streak through one side of the wig, which is a nice touch.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how soft and real the hair felt/looked.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this for my 7 year old granddauther for Halloween!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s grate my 9 year old loves it!</li>
      <li>I does have a hint of red, as it&#x27;s not a mousy brown, but it is certainly brown.  </li>
      <li>I am an adult.  </li>
      <li>but my 6 year old wears it when I clip it in front.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 5 yr old for Halloween.</li>
      <li>so my 8 year old could not wear it.  </li>
      <li>decent quality but hard to maintain good for a few uses</li>
      <li>The only down side to this wig is that it is more brunette than red in color..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more brown than red, and you have to sort of pull out the white streak</li>
      <li>Bangs were really long but other than that very good thick long wig l.</li>
      <li>However, it looks fantastic and it just needs some time to get used to the feel of it not fitting quite like a hat.  </li>
      <li>which is kind of creepy on a 2 yr old.</li>
      <li>It is way too dark, without even really a hint of red.</li>

    <li> The actual quality of the wig is fantastic. Love the weight and the hair feels almost real. It is very much like Anna. However, the size of the wig is small- even with the straps unhooked. I can barely get it to fit over my whole head. I gave it 3 stars because of the size- this seems more for kids heads</li>
    <li> The wig is admittedly of good quality, however the color is not anywhere near Anna&#x27;s. It is way too dark, without even really a hint of red.</li>
    <li> Great quality wig!  Purchased this for my 7 year old granddauther for Halloween!  She was Ana and her identical twin sister was Elsa! Looks just like the real thing!  Fast shipping too!!</li>
    <li> This is not at all made for a child so my 8 year old could not wear it.  Also the brad was a little messy and the bangs were soooo long that they covered my daughters entire face.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my niece for her Anna costume from Frozen - she loved it and it is very good quality nothing like a cheap holloween wig.&lt;br /&gt;She is 7 and it fit her head with no problem not too small or big really cute on her</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on to good but looks like Ana hair!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this wig for the price. It&#x27;s a little more brown than red, and you have to sort of pull out the white streak so it shows, but the quality was higher than I expected, and it&#x27;s cute!</li>
    <li> so much better than the children&#x27;s dress up wigs...this fits my 7 year old perfectly and adjustable so she&#x27;ll have it for a long time playing Anna!</li>
    <li> Great wig. Soft silky hair with perfect white &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; streak. Love it! The fit is more for an adult but my 6 year old wears it when I clip it in front. She and her friends love it!</li>
    <li> Got for granddaughters for Christmas. They r worst they money! They will love dressing up &amp; playing with them😃</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, it looks like a professional wig.</li>
    <li> I have a 23 1/2 inch head, so I was worried about this fitting right. As expected, when I got it, the wig was far too tight. Luckily, I followed some internet tutorials to make a bigger wig cap (as the one included was small for me too), and how to make the wig bigger by cutting and adding elastic. It worked, and now the wig feels fine! My other complaint is that this wig is too brown. Anna has red hair, and there isn&#x27;t any hint of red or orange in the wig. It&#x27;s very soft though, and the streak is perfect!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Adjustable size, fits a large (child&#x27;s) head. Great price $12. It even has the blond streak in it. My daughter dresses like Anna and is highly entertained! Very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Bangs were really long but other than that very good thick long wig l.</li>
    <li> Just after 2 wears it was messy and of no use now</li>
    <li> This wig is pretty great.  It is soft and pretty. The quality for the price is wonderful. The braids are long, and the wig hair net that comes with it is very helpful for getting the wig to look good without having your own hair sticking out the sides.  The wig fits my 9-year-old very well. It is a bit small for my head, though.  The only down side to this wig is that it is more brunette than red in color..maybe it could pass as a very brown-auburn.  I does have a hint of red, as it&#x27;s not a mousy brown, but it is certainly brown.  So if you want that very definite red-head look for your Anna, this isn&#x27;t going to give it to you.  I does have the little white streak through one side of the wig, which is a nice touch.  Overall, for our uses, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this I thought because of the price it would look cheep but NO it&#x27;s grate my 9 year old loves it! It looks soo real I would even wear it! Love this</li>
    <li> SUPER DUPER cute. I bought this for my 5 yr old for Halloween. It was exactly what here Anna outfit needed.</li>
    <li> For the money it was a good wig. The bangs didn&#x27;t really work for me... they looked odd but the braids were cute!</li>
    <li> decent quality but hard to maintain good for a few uses</li>
    <li> Nice good quality costume wig! Worked perfecrly</li>
    <li> As advertised. looks like real hair...which is kind of creepy on a 2 yr old.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how soft and real the hair felt/looked.  It is well made, with adjustable straps to make it smaller if desired.  It does fit a little different than you may expect, more on the back of the head.  However, it looks fantastic and it just needs some time to get used to the feel of it not fitting quite like a hat.  I actually loved the deeper color because when my brown hairline showed through slightly at the bang line, it wasn&#x27;t super glaring.  I am an adult.  I think my daughter could pull it off (3) if I tightened the straps, but the wig is quite long on her.  I honesty did not have success with the wig cap, but that was just a bonus with the purchase.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This wig is definitely worth the purchase! It&#x27;s very full bodied and looks natural. My white streak isn&#x27;t discolored like I&#x27;ve read from reviews on other products. And despite other reviews, the wig fits perfectly (the other purchasers probably don&#x27;t know how how to put wigs on; I advise referring to a YouTube video), just make sure to use the hooks! Leaving them unhooked won&#x27;t hold the wig in place and make it seem &amp;#34;too small&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> love it soft hair very nice quality wig. i got it before delivery schedule time</li>
    <li> This wig looked great!! There was several people that thought it was my real hair!!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my granddaughter&#x27;s dress up box...she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> This wig is adjustable so it fits my daughter perfectly.  It looks super real.</li>
