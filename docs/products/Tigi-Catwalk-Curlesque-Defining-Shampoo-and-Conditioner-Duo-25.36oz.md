      <li>and I just love it</li>
      <li>I love the smell and how it works on my hair.  </li>

      <li>Used to love this product.  </li>

      <li>I have been using catwalk for five or more years now</li>
      <li>I love how this makes my hair feel, look and smell.</li>
      <li>but the curly hair tigi shampoo they had before is just better.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve purchased sooo many.  </li>
      <li>So glad I found this duo set.</li>
      <li>I did like the way this shampoo and conditioner helped my hair become wavy with more volume</li>
      <li>I have not ever found a better product for keeping my hair from frizzing out.  </li>
      <li>i love them.  </li>
      <li>Still, I do miss that feeling and sometimes think my hair isn&#x27;t getting very clean.</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo for my fine, flyaway, dry hair.</li>
      <li>I love this Shappoo and conditioner, it keeps my curls moisturized, but I have to use a clarifying shampoo nonce a week, because it leaves build up from curleque light weight moose.</li>
      <li>So, THIS product, Curlesque, is not as wonderful as the other.  </li>
      <li>It was hands down the best curly-hair washing system I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length, fine, curly hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, sulfate-free and does a great job of keeping my hair clean and smelling fresh without an overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner is my absolute favorite!  </li>
      <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m so glad to find the large size on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Because my curls are achieved through chemicals, I have to use a light leave-in conditioner as well.  </li>
      <li>But nothing has been awesome enough to get me away from Curlesque--I&#x27;ll buy as much as I can find if they ever discontinue it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft, as moisturized, as de-tangled, nor smelling as good as its predecessor.</li>
      <li>I also like the way the product smells; it has a light jasmine scent that isn&#x27;t too sweet.  </li>
      <li>The smell is great and lasts a long time, esp if you use the serum.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>thought this would be better since i paid so much.</li>
      <li>(Organix Renewing Morrocon Argan Oil, I brush or comb it through, then scrunch in Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Sculpt).  </li>
      <li>This Shampoo and Conditioner does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
      <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
      <li>Was not as good as I expected for the price.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your hair soft, smooth and adds ton a volume!</li>
      <li>Sulfate free is the way to go, particularly for curly haired people.</li>
      <li>Easy enough to clean</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>- I still love this shampoo and conditioner and use it regularly.  </li>
      <li>Such a strong flowery scent.</li>
      <li>Very high quality stuff</li>
      <li>I have naturally very curly hair, but somewhat fine in the sense that it&#x27;s not coarse</li>
      <li>There was way too much fragrance in these products.</li>
      <li>I really like the curls rock amplifier</li>
      <li>The smell throws me off a bit, because it is really perfumey.</li>
      <li>However, it is still better than other drugstore and salon brands that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I bought this system during a liter sale and it came highly recommended from the ladies working in the store.</li>
      <li>so I had high expectations.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, but when I received this product it was a MESS!</li>
      <li>Plus, I live in the midwest and it is winter.</li>
      <li>so different from the light blue Catwalk bottles.</li>
      <li>I used to use tresemme or john frieda and finally came across this product because I wanted something with no sulfates, I have to say it makes my curls more pronounced especially if I leave the conditioner in for just a minute instead of a long period of time.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this shampoo and conditioner is not as good as I need it to be.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I have naturally curly thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the middle of a Texas summer right now, and my long, curly hair needs all the help (and moisture)</li>
      <li>Every once in a while, a different product catches my eye, and I&#x27;ll try something new for comparison.  </li>
      <li>It gives my naturally wavy hair extra bounce and softness!</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner is okay, but not great.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product and at least 30% less price from the stores.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to trying these products, but it left my hair feeling dry and stringy.</li>
      <li>I had rotated through several products before purchasing the Curlesque (formerly Curls Rock) shampoo and conditioner on the advice of someone with naturally curly hair.  </li>

<li> but I had to wash my hair right after it dried with my other shampoo.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that I need so much conditioner that I am on my second bottle of conditioner.</li>
<li> But the conditioner is thick and moisturizing, it really helps with my curl pattern.</li>
<li> and I definitely notice my hair being easier to manage both when it&#x27;s wet and dry.</li>
<li> Having curly hair and living in a dry climate don&#x27;t go well together, but with Tigi Catwalk Curlesque Defining Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</li>
<li> I can either dry my hair with the blow dryer or let it air dry ...</li>
<li> They must have changed something because it weighed my curls down and left them dry and lifeless.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t get me wrong; this is not a bad product.</li>
<li> Keep in mind that I also add product to my hair after I wash it when it&#x27;s still wet and damp</li>
<li> The old Catwalk Curls Rock seriously rocked.  </li>
<li> over 10 % of the shampoo had leaked out cause the cap wasn&#x27;t on tight enough and it was just a mess inside the plastic wrapping.</li>
<li> I bought a small bottle to try out and ended up buying the big ones.</li>
<li> THe shampoo is thick and luxurious feeling, and it does not dry out my hair.</li>
<li> And I don&#x27;t mean the 7$ bottle of drug store or walmart shampoo that say&#x27;s \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; when there are multiple types of sulfates.</li>
<li> This one left my hair dried out and dull.</li>
<li> I have very long, thick, curly hair.</li>
<li> Before buying this I read a lot of reviews and understood there would be little to no suds.</li>
<li> I was to told to give it a few days to see results</li>
<li> I only wish it were less expensive</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used to use tresemme or john frieda and finally came across this product because I wanted something with no sulfates, I have to say it makes my curls more pronounced especially if I leave the conditioner in for just a minute instead of a long period of time.</li>
    <li> Used to love this product.  They must have changed something because it weighed my curls down and left them dry and lifeless.  Not sure what they did to it but, I wish they&#x27;d have left it alone!</li>
    <li> I have been using catwalk for five or more years now and I just love it</li>
    <li> I bought this system during a liter sale and it came highly recommended from the ladies working in the store. I&#x27;m in the middle of a Texas summer right now, and my long, curly hair needs all the help (and moisture) it can get!     Unfortunately, this shampoo and conditioner is not as good as I need it to be. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw, but I get the worst frizz after using it if I don&#x27;t pack on a bunch of product after washing. Plus, the conditioner smells terrible. It&#x27;s a flowery scent that reminds me of a funeral parlor.</li>
    <li> My shoulder-length hair is naturally thick and frizzy, and I&#x27;ve chosen to get a permanent twice a year in order to avoid using a straightening device every day.  I had rotated through several products before purchasing the Curlesque (formerly Curls Rock) shampoo and conditioner on the advice of someone with naturally curly hair.  The shampoo cleans my hair without drying it out, and the conditioner hydrates my hair without adding weight to it.  Because my curls are achieved through chemicals, I have to use a light leave-in conditioner as well.  I also like the way the product smells; it has a light jasmine scent that isn&#x27;t too sweet.  Update 2/28/15 - I still love this shampoo and conditioner and use it regularly.  Every once in a while, a different product catches my eye, and I&#x27;ll try something new for comparison.  But nothing has been awesome enough to get me away from Curlesque--I&#x27;ll buy as much as I can find if they ever discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is okay, but not great.  The old Catwalk Curls Rock seriously rocked.  It was hands down the best curly-hair washing system I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve purchased sooo many.  My hair is long and curly and impossible to de-tangle without taking an hour, UNLESS I use Curls Rock.  That conditioner not only softened and moisturized my hair, but also de-tangled without any hassle.  And it smelled great, too!  So, THIS product, Curlesque, is not as wonderful as the other.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft, as moisturized, as de-tangled, nor smelling as good as its predecessor. However, it is still better than other drugstore and salon brands that I&#x27;ve used.  Also, I would have to agree with the company&#x27;s claim that this product helps to prep and maintain curls for styling.  I don&#x27;t use heat styling nor hairspray, just some cream gel and shine serum, and my hair maintains its shape all day.</li>
    <li> I received this set as a gift and loved it. The smell throws me off a bit, because it is really perfumey. But the conditioner is thick and moisturizing, it really helps with my curl pattern. Sometimes I just pump some into my hand and run it through my hair before brushing it. THe shampoo is thick and luxurious feeling, and it does not dry out my hair. I will purchase this set again!</li>
    <li> this is terrible for anyone with natural curly hair.  so different from the light blue Catwalk bottles. i love them.  thought this would be better since i paid so much.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but when I received this product it was a MESS! over 10 % of the shampoo had leaked out cause the cap wasn&#x27;t on tight enough and it was just a mess inside the plastic wrapping.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is my absolute favorite!  I have naturally thick curly hair but this brings out my curls so perfectly! So glad I found this duo set. Obsessed!</li>
    <li> Was not as good as I expected for the price.  I really like the curls rock amplifier so I had high expectations.  Left my hair frizzy.  Would not recommend for curly hair</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I have hair with body, but using these products helped define my curls.  My friends noticed the difference and asked which product I was using.  So I told them and now they use it.</li>
    <li> I love this Shappoo and conditioner, it keeps my curls moisturized, but I have to use a clarifying shampoo nonce a week, because it leaves build up from curleque light weight moose.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner ever. I bought a small bottle to try out and ended up buying the big ones.</li>
    <li> The product smells good, it work alright, im hoping i&#x27;ll see more results i just have like a week using it!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is easier to comb and the curls look great.  I can either dry my hair with the blow dryer or let it air dry ...either way it looks great. I was to told to give it a few days to see results but I already started seeing results from using it just last night.</li>
    <li> Having curly hair and living in a dry climate don&#x27;t go well together, but with Tigi Catwalk Curlesque Defining Shampoo &amp; Conditioner my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite.  I love the smell and how it works on my hair.  I only wish it were less expensive but this is the best price I have found.  Very high quality stuff</li>
    <li> Sulfate free is the way to go, particularly for curly haired people. And I don&#x27;t mean the 7$ bottle of drug store or walmart shampoo that say&#x27;s \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; when there are multiple types of sulfates. Well worth the expense.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using tigi products since 2005. don&#x27;t get me wrong; this is not a bad product. but the curly hair tigi shampoo they had before is just better. at least for my hair.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have naturally curly thick hair.  Keep in mind that I also add product to my hair after I wash it when it&#x27;s still wet and damp (Organix Renewing Morrocon Argan Oil, I brush or comb it through, then scrunch in Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Sculpt).  Tigi Catwalk Curlesque Shampoo and Conditioner is awesome, my curls are definitely more defined, and it leaves my hair feeling very soft, and it smells so good.  I can clearly see the difference when I was using other shampoos and conditioners using the same hair products afterwards. Definitely a great product and worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have a mix between 3c &amp;4a hair. The TIGI Curlesque product is the only thing that moisturizes and keeps my hair frizz-free. Moisture stays in hair for like three days and I don&#x27;t have to worry about greasiness.</li>
    <li> Everything was on time but the packaging was terrible. The bottles of shampoo and conditioner were simply taped shut and placed in a bubble bag. No interior bags and no protection. The tape did not work and the conditioner leaked all over everything. Easy enough to clean but I lost quite a bit of the product in the packaging. Plus, I live in the midwest and it is winter. You can&#x27;t ship unprotected liquids to the midwest in February!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as curls rock by catwalk. This one left my hair dried out and dull.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo and Conditioner does exactly what it claims to do! It gives my naturally wavy hair extra bounce and softness!</li>
    <li> I have naturally very curly hair, but somewhat fine in the sense that it&#x27;s not coarse but I have a LOT of hair. I was recommended this product by my hairstylist and I definitely notice my hair being easier to manage both when it&#x27;s wet and dry.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m so glad to find the large size on Amazon. I have very long, thick, curly hair. After about two months of using the TIGI Catwalk, I noticed a big difference. My hair is shinier and overall healthier looking. I use the Catwalk curl serum as well and both products are great. The smell is great and lasts a long time, esp if you use the serum. Before buying this I read a lot of reviews and understood there would be little to no suds. Still, I do miss that feeling and sometimes think my hair isn&#x27;t getting very clean. But once it drys it looks great, so my worries are for nothing.</li>
    <li> I have not ever found a better product for keeping my hair from frizzing out.  combine with leave in conditioner and curl product and it looks beautiful!</li>
    <li> I did like the way this shampoo and conditioner helped my hair become wavy with more volume but I had to wash my hair right after it dried with my other shampoo.  There was way too much fragrance in these products. I even had to ask my adult son to take it from the bathroom and throw it in the trash because the perfume was so awful.  My son said it gave him a headache too.</li>
    <li> I could tell the difference the very first time I used it, and now after six weeks it is still doing the job and making my hair feel and look great.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have beautiful curls after using the shampoo and conditioner together!! Plus olive oil after the bath my curls looks amazing!</li>
    <li> Such a strong flowery scent. I hate the smell of flowers so in my shower, I could barely take it. Gave it to my mom who loves it though. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and at least 30% less price from the stores. I have bought them before and I did again. Keeps your hair soft, smooth and adds ton a volume! Perfect for people like me who has semi curly hair :)</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my hair feel, look and smell.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner for curly hair because even though it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates you still get a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragrance of the product. My hair feels clean and not frizzy.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to trying these products, but it left my hair feeling dry and stringy. I have shoulder length, fine, curly hair. I went back to Devacare No Poo and One Condition, which has better ingredients anyway.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for my fine, flyaway, dry hair. It&#x27;s gentle, sulfate-free and does a great job of keeping my hair clean and smelling fresh without an overpowering scent. My only complaint is that I need so much conditioner that I am on my second bottle of conditioner. They should make the conditioner twice the size as the shampoo!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this brand.  I buy it when I can find it at a &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; price.</li>
