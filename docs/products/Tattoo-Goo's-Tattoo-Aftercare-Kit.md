      <li>many people already have what they need at home.</li>
      <li>My artist recommended Aquaphore and that is probably even better then my face lotion.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know that it is any more or less effective honestly, but it feels better and makes the healing more comfortable for</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Each product has a special use and works as stated. I have a hand tattoo and was worried about fading, but it truly is about care. Follow directions and have a great looking tattoo.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product along with the H20 kit. I was getting a lot of work done over the course of a couple of months and was not sure which to try so I ordered them both. Tattoo Goo aftercare kit was my favorite. Everything was easy to use and my tattoos seemed more vibrant after each use. The Salve and the SPF stick are my favorite. My tattoo healing time appeared to much shorter using these products which was a plus. I will continue to buy the Salve because it is easy to travel with and helps make my Tattoos look vibrant and like new.</li>
    <li> Am pretty happy with this kit so far.  The soap is very gentle and did not irritate while the ink was healing.  Tattoo Goo has been my standby for previous work, and it continues to be a great product, helping the healing process without weird odor or greasiness.  I haven&#x27;t used the sunblock yet, but the other tube of moisturizing lotion has been great so far also.  Nice light lotion, absorbs easy, has a light scent that is not noticeable after absorbs into skin.  All together a great kit and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer with this brand of tattoo aftercare, I have 8 (so far) and have used \\&quot;Tattoo Goo\\&quot; whenever possible. The actual product that arrives is not the one pictured... it&#x27;s actually the newer \\&quot;white bottle\\&quot; versions. As far as I no, there&#x27;s no difference other than packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What comes with this kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Plastic/vinyl carrying bag (with zipper), for portability. Has an insert full of instructions!&lt;br /&gt;- Subscription information for \\&quot;Tattoo\\&quot; magazine. Pretty decent publication if you like this sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Tattoo Goo\\&quot; salve, small tin. Contains ingredients like beeswax, olive oil, etc. I use this when I leave the house because of the lasting effects of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Tattoo Goo\\&quot; lotion. Same purpose as the salve, but provides more immediate effects for a dry/itchy tattoo. I use this when I am just hanging around the house, as multiple applications are needed throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Tattoo Goo\\&quot; soap/cleaning solution. Works for tattoos and piercings. Great safe, PH balanced way to clean your tattoo. Follow the directions and DON&#x27;T SCRUB.&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Tattoo Goo\\&quot; color guard sunscreen SPF 30. Easy, quick applicator. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this until after your tattoo has fully healed... you should not expose your new tattoo to direct sunlight or bodies of water anyway! Great for keeping rich colors from fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, follow the directions of your tattoo/piercing provider. No product is a supplement for common sense.</li>
    <li> Tattoo Goo has amazing stuff!! The lotion is great, smooth and makes new &amp; old tattoos look great!! The tattoo wash is perfect for keeping the new tattoo clean and healthy and the blam that comes in the tin is simply amazing stuff...makes those older tattoos look new again!! I&#x27;ve bought Tattoo Goo in the past and will continue for life!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this, and it looks nothing like the picture.. Very tiny containers and they were all only half full! I am very unsatisfied. Also didnt have very good directions. I would just reccomend using a&amp;d ointment and plain lotion to care for a tattoo instead of buying this ripoff.</li>
    <li> I was so overwhelmingly underwhelmed with this product.  The balm is hard to use, as is the sunblock stick.  The cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam up or show any real sign of cleansing and the lotion that was supposed to have lasting moisture just seemed to evaporate and my skin dried far too quickly for what I expected from products specifically made to care for a new tattoo.  Will stick to my Dove soap and Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. My tattoo healed faster using tattoo goo. During the healing process it itched a lot less.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of these products because I have only had them a few days. However, what a huge disappointment so far! The goo is so thick and difficult to get a thin layer applied. The lotion and the soap are the opposite! They are SO THIN they are almost water and pour out of the tubes as soon as you open them thus creating a huge amount of wasted product! When you take into conscideration the tubes are basically travel size products they will be gone in no time!</li>
    <li> The lotion works well. The salve brightens more than the lotion, but at first it does have a little funky smell. It does go away after 30 or so minutes.</li>
    <li> I was a nearly 40yr old tattoo virgin with no idea beyond the short lecture my tattoo artist gave me while I was still riding the high of pain-induced endorphins to guide me on how to care for my brand new tattoo...the first of many that will eventually become a full back piece.  I sought guidance on the interwebz only to find a confusing mix of ads and opinions.  After doing my best to care for my new, expensive bit of body art the itching set in...OMG, the itching!  And I sensibly turned to Amazon where other customers guided me to Tattoo Goo.  I paid for overnight shipping, did I mention the itching? And was greeted by a very small box the next morning.  I was, of corse, skeptical.  But, with in the little box was a little plastic bag with everything I needed to make the itching stop, and to properly care for my investment.  The contents of that one little plastic bag have now seen me through three beautiful tattoos and will be seeing me through a fourth that I got today...and a fifth scheduled for a month from now.</li>
    <li> My wife has been getting her half-sleeve done over the past few months. After my first sleeve I learned that aftercare is crucial to having you tattoo&#x27;s heal and look great for a lifetime. I previously used a product called InkFix however it seems like it&#x27;s no longer made and whats left is very expensive. After reading reviews I gave this set a try, I&#x27;m so happy with it I ordered another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gives you everything you need to heal and keep your ink looking fresh. Has a very pleasant scent, not perfume or medicated smelling. Very soothing on sore, healing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I know this is a sampler pack, meaning not huge volume of product but I wish there was a little more Balm and lotion. The sunscreen stick is great but really doesn&#x27;t come into play until after you&#x27;ve healed completely. From experience this is months after a tattoo. I would rather have double the balm or lotion as that is needed in the early stages of healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great set and I recommend it for anyone planing on getting a tattoo. Proper aftercare (and keeping out of the sun) will keep your ink looking clean and new for a long long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift set, or something to give to those customers that just keep coming back. Its cheap for what you get and really nice. I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This kit is super inexpensive and has come in handy so very much.  I haven&#x27;t ran out of any of the products after a year and 7 new tattoos.  In addition, the stick is awesome for those ladies and gents who enjoy tattoos and sun tan salons.  If you are worried about the tanning bed fading out your tats, just use the stick before getting in the bed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff since I got my first tattoo and I won&#x27;t use anything else. The tattoo goo salve is perfect and I love it. I use it on all my tattoos (new and old). I would recommend this to anyone who is getting ink or has ink. It is wonderful and you will not regret purchasing this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have a few tats and this stuff is by far the best i have used on a new tat.  Will keep in my mind for my next one</li>
    <li> I got my first Goo kit for some new work I had before going to Iraq, I got dirty dusty ans few chances to washdry and care for it This kit was a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;healed quick and full of color!  this stuff goes a long way also good value</li>
    <li> I use it for my derma rolling on my face or my breasts and it does a good job of taking away the sting and swelling from daily use of the derma roller. Good product.</li>
    <li> My tattoo artist did my thigh piece and I used Goo on it and it developed spots and didn&#x27;t want to heal, among making it itch a lot more. I asked my artist and he asked what I use so I told him, and he told me to immediately stop and go back to Aquafor. Tattoo Goo clogs pores and makes the healing process so much longer and more likely to damage the tattoo. Do not use this. Go to your local Walgreens, Kroger, CVS, and get yourself a bottle of Aquafor for about $5.</li>
    <li> this product works great on nu tattoos i highly recommend 2 anybody. the tattoo salve works wonders and it doesnt smell bad,the lotions great too and the spf suncreen protector is gud for old tats helps protect frm the sun and keeps it shiny looken.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical of whether or not these products would work on my tattoo. I have two tattoos, one four years old and one that I received two weeks ago. It has helped speed the healing on my newer tattoo up, but what I really loved is how is made the color of my older tattoo much brighter; it has faded a little bit but the day after using the products on it, it is so much brighter. It&#x27;s somewhat surreal. I love this and would buy it again. I just wished that the soap wasn&#x27;t so watery--kind of hard to work up a lather from it.</li>
    <li> I got these when my tattoo was only about 6 days old, and the colors were already a little bit faded, but the salve and lotion made the colors bright and shiny again. Highly recommended to anyone with tattoos.</li>
    <li> I was told to get this when I got my new tattoo and it worked well really gave it a shine and it wasn&#x27;t overly oily great stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this kit. I swear by tattoo goo, it is the best thing for any tat. This kit is awesome.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Use it on all of my tattoos. New and old. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.Fairly priced too. Try it.</li>
    <li> This kit is great for first time tattoo receivers as well as old hands. It contains everything you need to get from healing to protecting.</li>
    <li> Is good product, I like the bundle because it includes all the essentials, fast shipping. Worked very good. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had gotten tattooed and the artist stated to use unscented dial soap to clean and unscented lotion as well. I had done so while part of the tattoo remained ok. I had gotten tattooed on both arms.. Certain parts on each tattoo began to appear as if they were getting infected  and the parts that weren&#x27;t were not treated any differently. My arms ached in pain and began completely red around some of the tattoos.. These were not big tattoos.. Kanji lettering and a heart.. Anywho.. after I got this product, within 15 minutes of applying the anti bacterial soap .. then air drying.. and then placing the lotion.. I was pain free and the tattoo started healing like it should right away.</li>
    <li> The allegiance to Tattoo aftercare is unreal. When researching products I found everything from &amp;#34;this product is horrible&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;I will never get a tattoo without it&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t need it&amp;#34; is the most common. Now that the lines are drawn in the sand i&#x27;ll offer my advice as to why I think Tattoo Goo is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t need it&amp;#34; - Well actually, I did. The argument here is that Goo is just a collection of things that you have around the house. I didn&#x27;t have the collection at the house. This kit is relatively inexpensive (compared to the Tattoo!) and it bundles all of what you need together. Small enough for travel and storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Horrible&amp;#34; - I don&#x27;t understand how this collection could be horrible. It&#x27;s not complicated and it was effective for me. I usually see the its horrible comment followed up by the recc&#x27; of another product. Maybe ill try a different product for my follow up to see if there is any validity to the comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size - I got about 40% of my back tattoo&#x27;d the Goo kit was just enough. The only one that&#x27;s nearly empty is the soap. If you&#x27;re getting smaller tats you will have this kid for round 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that you read all of the aftercare things just as I have so I won&#x27;t get into all of that. It&#x27;s really not all that hard. If you are getting a back tattoo make sure that you have someone dedicated to help. If not there are back applicators on amazon for 6 bucks.</li>
    <li> This is great care kit for your tattoos it helped it feel better to be honest especially when it itched!</li>
    <li> Just got some more added on to my sleeve a few days ago. I&#x27;ve been using it for two days, and it seems to be pretty good. I mainly purchased it because I&#x27;m going to be on a lake all weekend and I&#x27;m curious to see how it will work.</li>
    <li> nice product, good smell, nice feeling on fresh tattoo.</li>
    <li> I like tattoo goo, Iv been using it on tattoos for years and I have never had a problem. so good product, good price but where is the carrier bag that was pictured? that would have been nice.</li>
    <li> Great price and easy kit to purchase before getting a tattoo.</li>
    <li> For my first tattoo, I had been advised to go to CVS and pick out some lotion and just make it was blah blah blah blah. So i did and I used that same lotion for the next few tattoos, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, upon getting my most recent tattoo, my artist recommended I get either Tattoo Goo or Aquaphor. Obviously I went with the Goo -- And it&#x27;s such a huge improvement over what I had been using. I&#x27;ve had significantly decreased redness around the tattoo, my skin gets dry less quickly, and it seems to have healed so much faster. I&#x27;m 100% sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the Salve or the Color Guard yet, but will update when I do. In the meantime, I can&#x27;t say enough about the Antibacterial Soap and the Lotion... except that they come in kinda small bottles... though you only need a very little bit at a time, so it&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> i love this little set. it is great for tattoos and my husband loves it as well its great for his tattoo stuff makes a good addition to the collection.</li>
    <li> This is kinda overpriced for what you get. It&#x27;s essentially a nice moisturizer in the carmex way, a SMALL bottle of lotion,, soap, and a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;You can get a better quality sunscreen with higher SPF factor for a few bucks more.&lt;br /&gt;Any lotion would do,&lt;br /&gt;I love the salve, but it too is unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;As for the liquid soap you can get this elsewhere in generic form, and most tattoo artists will tell you this themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF it wasn&#x27;t so overpriced I would recommend this for your first two months with a tattoo b/c everything you need is right there. They shy away from selling this at many tattoo parlors b/c they know it&#x27;s really just packaging.and many people already have what they need at home. or can get dual use items. Unscented Liquid soap is fine -- Like Soft soap.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My new tattoos always feel so much better after i use the cleanser, i also use it on my piercings and they heal up super fast. The lotion isnt too thick which i think is great. The salve makes my old tattoos look brand new again. And it got to my house the day it was expected to. Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the promptness of this delivery. i dont get my tattoo for another 10 days so i am unable to state if the product works. My only \\&quot;criticism\\&quot; is that the package does not look anything like it is pictured. The color and size and shape of the product is completely different. On the plus side, the price was reasonable so, i purchased this product (from a different seller, same price) for my little sister to use for when she gets her 1st tattoo. i will write another review after getting my new tattoo</li>
    <li> The lotion is good for after your tattoo is healed. But the salve is what you want for fresh ink. Everything came out bright and clear. I&#x27;ve used tattoo goo for my last 2 tattoos and they came out much better than the first that I got and did not use this with.</li>
    <li> Made the healing process a lot more comfortable. Everything u need in one box.</li>
    <li> havent used the sunblock stuff but every thing else works great i had a tattoo that looked nasty and this stuff helped it out in just two days recomind for personal tattoo care that is if u get alot tattoos like me</li>
    <li> The tattoo goo products are all good minus the salve it caused me itching aand burning when I applied it to my tattoo. But everything else is great esp anti bacterial soap</li>
    <li> Excellent product, shipping is fast. 5 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;Everything you need.</li>
    <li> Love the goo, cover stick and wash, but the lotion smells terrible and isnt very moisturizing. Loved the other 3 items.</li>
    <li> The package comes with 4 items and comes in a very nice plastic carrying pouch with after care instructions. The Tattoo Goo Cleansing Wash (2oz., 59.15ml), Tattoo Goo Aftercare Lotion (2oz., 59.15ml), Tattoo Goo Colour Guard Stick (0.45oz., 13g) and Tattoo Goo Salve (0.75oz., 21g). Honestly it has all you would need if you got a new Tattoo and all the items are the original Tattoo Goo Brand. The only concern is that, as you can tell by the sizes, you would need a lot of these products dependent on the size of your tattoo, so just keep that in mind. The wash, the lotion and the salve are all good and I have used them all with no problems at all. Again my only concern is that the salve is a tad bit greasy and should only be used when your home, the lotion I would use when going out so it does not stick and mess up my clothes, especially if you wear fully covering clothes. I have yet to use the colour guard so I cant comment on its effectiveness, but it&#x27;s Tattoo Goo brand and I really don&#x27;t think I will have a problem.</li>
    <li> I love my tattoo goo kit! I would recommend this product to anyone. Tattoo goo is the way to go when it comes to caring for your tattoos. :)</li>
    <li> The salve makes my fully healed tattoo itch (tattoo is almost 1 year old)&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use the lotion either because I prefer lubriderm (sp?) But I love the soap. I received this near the end of the healing process, maybe 2-3 weeks after I got it and I had previously been using a bar of jergins mild soap. Deffently prefer the tattoo goo. And I don&#x27;t use the color gaurd very often because my tattoo is on the inside of my arm. It&#x27;s basically a sunblock stick, which I would recommend to people who have tattoos that see a lot of sun, and it&#x27;s small so it can fit on your pocket or purse.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would recommend the soap to everyone, but for other people who have sensitive skin like I do, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the lotions.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good kit comes with everything you need after your tattoo and some i am happy with it!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband who normally uses this product for his tattoos. It works and doesn&#x27;t ruin your tattoo. He just got a new tattoo done, we ran out of the ointment, this seller delivered quickly and item was priced right. Product highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Comes with everything you need to take care of your tattoo. It all smells really great, with the exception of the lotion since it is unscented.</li>
    <li> Tattoo goo is a great tattoo skin care product. I really enjoy the unique smell it has as well. Overall it keeps my skin soft and keeps my tattoos looking brand new. Applies easily, and the sun tan color gaurd stick is VERY easy and applies a lot better than other brands i have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> I bought the kit mostly for the sun care protection and wash. I do use everything in the kit now. it all works very good. my tattoo looks great.</li>
    <li> Great price, did the job, although not entirely sure if it is better that the competitors or even normal lotion. I used Aquaphor on my previous tattoo (which is apparently not good for it?) and it came out just as fine as the tattoos i used the Goo on. No blurring, anything. So for the price, i&#x27;m glad i bought it.</li>
    <li> You got your soap, your lotion, and a couple other things that I don&#x27;t use much but I&#x27;m sure they work fine.</li>
    <li> I would give this 2.5 stars but it wont let me so I&#x27;m just going to give it 2 because I don&#x27;t think it is worth a 3. I just got my first tattoo and thought this would be the best thing to get so I ordered it, at the time it was $18. The slave works pretty well and feels good for the first couple days after about a week I started to break out around my tattoo so I switched to the lotion. The lotion would just dry up and only kept my tattoo moist for about 5 mins. I kept having to wake up in the middle of the night to put more on because my tattoo would get so dry. Last night I put on some Cetaphil and that&#x27;s just a fragrance free lotion I use on my face and it worked so much better then the tattoo goo lotion and its not even one that tattoo artist recommend. My artist recommended Aquaphore and that is probably even better then my face lotion. So get the slave and possibly even the sun screen but you can find a better lotion at a drug store and a better soap. The soap is ok but it is really runny so I feel like I have used more then I have needed when i was my tattoo.</li>
    <li> I really liked the wash and the goo in the tin.  Good set to buy if getting a new tattoo</li>
    <li> I love the salve but as soon as I starting using the lotion my tattoo became really dry and flaky. I&#x27;ll probably go back to my other lotion but I love the other products.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little kit that contains everything you need to take care of a tattoo, from immediate aftercare to longterm care.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been a faithful user since 2006. I have tried a few other products (like tat wax, a&amp;e, etc) and this is the best. It has a good scent, specifically, it DOES NOT HAVE a FUNKRA scent that other products have. It is easy to apply and easy to apply correctly without excess. When you receive this, at least when I did, it did not look like the purple container pictured products provided. The Soap does not smell pleasant. The Lotion is not thick at all, very watery. The Goo itself is just the GREATEST. I am EXTREMELY Fair skinned, and a ginger, so I burn like a corpse in Death Valley during the middle of Summer. So the sun block provided is great. It is SPf 30 and very easy to apply, convenient, and does it&#x27;s job successfully.</li>
    <li> Pretty good kit for new tatts. Not to mention the price is not too expensive. My friends at work had been telling me to Check out this &amp; h2ocean i recommend if youre thinking about getting this to try it out</li>
    <li> Perfect for healing and protection!</li>
    <li> i had a small tattoo and it healed nicely. i used the soap and the lotion… haven&#x27;t tried the circular tattoo goo gel yet but the sunscreen applies on easily. haven&#x27;t really needed to use it</li>
    <li> I got this kit for a large back piece I&#x27;m having done. I&#x27;ve mainly used the soap and the lotion for the first 2 days after each session. They were both great for the outlining, but now that I&#x27;m having shading done, the soap stings a bit and the lotion doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all. I find myself needing to reapply it 20 minutes later and feeling very uncomfortable soon after. The sizes they give you are very small- fine for smaller pieces, but if I planned on using this throughout my back piece, I&#x27;d have to order at least 5-6 more packages, at the very minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see ordering this again if I was having something less than 4x4&amp;#34; done, otherwise I&#x27;ll stick with Lubriderm. Actually, I think I&#x27;ll just stick with Lubriderm anyway, but TattooGoo was fine to try.</li>
    <li> I give the products themselves 5 stars, but wish the soap and lotion bottles were larger. I hate to give it four stars for that, but you could get through a number of rounds with one kit if they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the products themselves - as I indicated - I love them. I am no expert but here is my take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Sure you could probably find most of this stuff elsewhere, but it is really nice to know you have everything you need to protect your tattoo from the get go. I recently got one on the inside of my arm. Because the skin is very tender there healing was really annoying. I needed all the help I could get to help with the itching and flaking, especially since it is summer and sweat gets into it.  It is just nice to have this stuff around and know you can take care of the thing that is going to be on your body forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My favorite part is the goo itself - the salve for direct aftercare.  The shop I go to gives a vitamin A and E ointment. It is ok, but I feel like the tattoo doesn&#x27;t get air when I have it on. Tattoo goo helps heal your tattoo, but doesn&#x27;t gunk up your pours. I don&#x27;t know that it is any more or less effective honestly, but it feels better and makes the healing more comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I really like the lotion. It is uncounted and not super thick. Most lotions you get at the store are really thick and you run into the same problem I mentioned earlier, gunking up your skin. This is a thin, scentless lotion that moisturizes, but doesn&#x27;t stick on your skin for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is all - at least supposedly - natural. I am by no means someone who REQUIRES everything in my life be natural. I can&#x27;t afford that. If the price is close to the same and I have a choice though, I will take products that are made with things I can mostly pronounce.  Tattoo goo fits the bill.</li>
    <li> This kit is great to have when you recently got a tattoo and after.</li>
    <li> Started a full leg piece and have been using this kit with every session (along with Tatu-Derm).  Color is extremely good!</li>
