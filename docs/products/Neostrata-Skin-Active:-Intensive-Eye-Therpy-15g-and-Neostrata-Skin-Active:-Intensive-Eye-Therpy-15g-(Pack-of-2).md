<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used this product for almost 2 weeks now.  The instructions tell you to use it once a day for a week and then switch to 2 times a day if tolerated.  I couldn&#x27;t understand why at first, but once I started using it more often I noticed that my eyes were actually drying out underneath.  I even used an additional under eye cream.  I have now switched to using it once a day or once every other day.  I guess I will see if there are any results in a few weeks. (Kenerase has a professional under eye serum/cream that is much better and has immediate results.)</li>
    <li> I read an article about skin care for 20 somethings that recommended this eye cream, so I decided to try it.  And I am so glad I did because I love it!  The first two weeks, I only put it on at night, and you could tell it was doing something because it tingled.  After two weeks I started using it in the morning and in the evening and it&#x27;s even more perfect for that!  The caffeine in it totally helps my eyes to wake up in the morning.  The small lines I had seem to get smaller everyday, I look &amp; feel more awake, there are no dark circles or puffiness at all.  And even better, it&#x27;s like a serum texture, so it&#x27;s not overly thick and greasy.  I recommend this product to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> This is part of the system my dermatologist told me to use .  She has beautiful skin and is also past fifty; and she uses these products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Teamine eye complex for the past two years...and I have never seen results like I have with the neostrata eye therapy. I am prone to bags under my eyes bc of allergies...lack of sleep...and just genetics.  I am 37 y.o so I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles...so I can&#x27;t speak to that. This serum glides on super smooth..no sticky feel at all...dries quickly so that I can apply my makeup within 4 minutes of application. The result is almost immediate...the bags disappear..eye area feels firmer...and moisturized all at the same time, I did experience a slight tingling sensation the first several times but it only lasted 5 seconds and wasn&#x27;t intense. I love this product! It makes me look more refreshed and rejuvinated. I hope it is healthy for the long term management of the delicate eye area bc the short term results are immediate and impressive. I never have high hopes for eye creams, but this one has me sold. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Neostrata for over 2 years &amp; love it.  The serum truly does eliminate dark circles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> The cream is gentle and non-irritating to very sensitive skin.  It seems to moisturize very well.  The anti-aging effect is not overly obvious, but I haven&#x27;t found any that are.</li>
    <li> i like so much, its comes quick, its the first time i used and iam proving the cream,  i hope do good thing in my eyes and wrinkles, the only thing is that i like that comes more bigger</li>
    <li> This is fab and you will find it for $75 every where but right here! It is not always listed on sale with this company so I just keep watch....</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I was first introduced to it by my Dermatologist.  Really noticed a big difference with smoothing around eye area and have received numerous comments about how great my skin looks.  A little expensive, but goes far and it totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I have ever used!</li>
    <li> The best eye cream. Smooths out crepey lines and fine wrinkles without being greasy or dry. Works well with my other products. Eye liners go on well. I&#x27;m a fan forever!</li>
    <li> It does not work; I have not seen any change in my skin.</li>
    <li> Very good. Bolsters eye area well and reduces puffiness, not so much the fine wrinkles, but does a better job than most other eye creams. Nice rich texture.</li>
    <li> Didnt see much difference for me.  I have heard I need to use it longer. 6 months to see a difference.  Switching to obagi gel.  Will reveiw that in a few months.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist&#x27;s office recommended this product for wrinkles.  It&#x27;s okay but I am not very impressed overall.  It doesn&#x27;t work any better than products I&#x27;ve purchased at Sephora, and may, in fact, be aggravating the problem.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream by far. I have tried a LOT - and they tend to break me out a bit around my eyes. With the NeoStrata product my eyes look brighter and feel more moisturized. Start using it just at night, but then after a couple weeks you can use it both day and night. Cant say enough great stuff about it - I love it!</li>
    <li> I have gone through about a thousand different eye creams trying to find one which can fix the puffiness under my eyes.  So far, this is the best one I have found; and even after a few weeks of regular use, it has not once cause any irritation to the delicate skin.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time. Great packaging. Product was as advertised. I am very pleased with the product and the price! I also enjoyed the free samples, sweet card of appreciation and seller contact information. I would order from this seller again. Thank you for making the skin care products I enjoy available at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have this stuff on auto-delivery. Noticeable difference in days. It feels nice too and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product came in on time. I don&#x27;t see that it does what it is supposed to but I have not found anything that does.</li>
    <li> After using for 3 weeks my face has lightened up and lines have disappeared.  Combine this with their dailly lotion</li>
    <li> My eyes got worse and i got more lines.. I am so sad and will never buy a thing again</li>
    <li> after about 6 weeks,  eyelids don&#x27;t look like crepe paper now</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  This eye cream has nice softening ingredients in it. Will give it 3  months before I can say more. Amazing price!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I used it for 4 months.</li>
    <li> NeoStrata Intensive Eye Therapy is wonderfully luxurious eye cream that helps combat the signs of aging.  It attacks the sagging under-eye area, fine lines, puffiness, crow’s feet, and discoloration.  This intensive eye therapy uses apple stem cell extract to help protect your own skin’s cells so that you look younger longer.  Collagen is boosted by peptides and NeoStrata’s NeoGlucosamine, which helps promote skin turnover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powerful antioxidant Vitamin E works to fight cell damage from free radicals.  Hyaluronic acid helps to promote hydration along with caffeine, which helps plump the skin.  Together they work their magic to refine and perfect your skin’s tone.  Because it’s so powerful, it’s recommended that you use it once a day for two weeks and then you can start using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin around your eyes will look younger and healthier when you use NeoStrata Intensive Eye Therapy.  What are you waiting for?  You’re not getting any younger, but you can fight the signs of aging with just a few drops of this fine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received compensation in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s much cheaper here than at the medical spas. I can see a difference in my under eye &amp; it only takes a tiny bit</li>
