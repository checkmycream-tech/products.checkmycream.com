<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother and she LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this as a gift again in the future</li>
    <li> Smaller that I thought it would be, I gave this away as a gift so I can&#x27;t say much for scent but the amount of money I paid for this wasn&#x27;t worth it. I wish I would have made my own basket.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Daughter for christmas. She loves this kinda stuff. I will update once I get her opinion. Packaged well. smells real good. And the bath tub is adorable. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> A perfect gift for that some special. My girlfriend love it.</li>
    <li> Dollar store quality.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than u think and can buy a much bigger one at Walmart</li>
    <li> my Mother loved it for Mothers Day</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it. I&#x27;ll have to ask her about the fragrance that was in it. I was impressed how nice the bathtub was. It would be cute as a bath planter afterwards or just to keep bath things in.</li>
    <li> Came on time and well made</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast but no option was given to put a message for the recipient.</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter-in-laws mother. She liked it a great deal.</li>
    <li> Ordered as a Christmas gift. Got exactly what was pictured and arrived before Christmas as promised.</li>
    <li> I bought this gift for my mom and she absolutely loved it!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this twice as gifts, for my sister and then for a friend.  Both said they thought it was very nice.</li>
    <li> Was shipped on time and the person loved their gift. Plus it smells super good! :)</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister and she loved the smell and the tiny bathtub!</li>
    <li> Okay, I consider myself a guy&#x27;s guy.  I can&#x27;t tell you details about how my mom&#x27;s skin loved it and how pretty the package is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a guy like me, this one is a no brainer.  I&#x27;m middle aged and my mom is aging gracefully.  Give it because it says you remember and you care. Your mom or spouse will never give you a critique for a review like this.  They will smile and tell you how much they love it... my mom did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I see it? yes, it looked great to me!  Did I borrow any of the products, nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So guys, my mom was really happy. Buy it and you won&#x27;t get complaints, at least I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy with no clue when it comes to touchy feely women&#x27;s gifts.  Not proud of it, just sure I have no clue.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift. My friend said it was pretty and liked it. So, I don&#x27;t know, really, about the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item as a gift for one of my Aunts, a Christmas gift. When it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t tell what it looked like because I had Amazon wrap it up for me. Well, when my Aunt opened it she loved it it seems but I thought it was a bit too small compared to the product picture. Maybe it was just a mistake on my part, maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, I cannot say what the products smell like or feel like or this or that like. But the little bathtub they come in was an eye catcher and everybody in my family commented that it was really cool. I&#x27;d only ever get this as a gift again if it was a lower price than what I had paid. Other than that, I&#x27;d probably get a different gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Bathtub container&lt;br /&gt;-Looks like a nice gift for somebody&lt;br /&gt;-Neatly wrapped&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-A bit too small for the price</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend and she loves it.  The old fashioned bath tub looks so sweet that I couldn&#x27;t resist buying it.  I think I&#x27;ll buy one for myself so I can use the bath tub as a holder on my sink top.  Great smell, great product.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my BFF, and so although I have not personally tried the products, my friend was pleased, and told me the silver tub makes a pretty display in her bathroom.</li>
    <li> they must have done some heavy zooming in because it looks much bigger on screen than in person. the bottles are more like those small shampoo and conditioner bottles you get in the hotels</li>
    <li> Made cheap ! Came in broken</li>
    <li> this is a nice addition to the bathroom the tub is cute and the rose jasmine smells nice</li>
    <li> I sent this gift set to my daughter-in-law for her 40th. birthday in another state. She received it late in the day the day before her birthday, which was just perfect timing. She texted me immediately and said how much she enjoyed the fragrance and the cute packaging tub (she has a claw foot tub in her new bathroom and loves it).</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present to a friend. She loved it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a birthday gift for my granddaughter she is very please with the products.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for my mother. She loved it especially the little tub everything came in.</li>
    <li> Simply and amazing gift set.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for gift for a cousin in the UK and being that postage is so high when shipped from US it is perfect and looks so elegant for the money!</li>
    <li> The look of the tub is misleading. It&#x27;s smaller than I expected and the tub is gold. In the picture it looked like an antique white but overall it was very nice.</li>
    <li> Very small but nice. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It was a birthday gift for a family remember and she liked it.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged, nice mild fragrance. If  this offered more bath salts with the package deal then the customer would have gotten more bang for the buck. I predict at least 3-4 uses from this package deal. If the consumer could have gotten the same amount of bath salts to equal same amount of uses for bath gel, bubble bath and lotion uses, it would have been a better deal.  Will use the decorative tub to keep my bath sponges in. Received my order fast.</li>
    <li> Cute for a good price.</li>
    <li> sent as a gift to a friend</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister in law for this past Christmas and she said she loved it.</li>
    <li> Cheap . . . basically says it all.  Tub is gold . . . plastic.  And of dubious quality.  Contents of the set are small quantities of unimpressive soaps, etc.  Nice but rather mundane.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister and she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> The bubble bath did not BUBBLE</li>
    <li> pretty nice, kinda love the sort of cheapy tub it all comes in but the products are very dollar store in presentation. would gladly have paid around 9$ soooo if its cheap go for it.</li>
    <li> Not bad, bought it as a gift.  Hope the person enjoys it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it was splendidly appreciated and enjoyed.  I might order on for me so I can see the tub.</li>
    <li> The package was soaked in gel and cream. and the scent is nothing like jasmine (can&#x27;t smell the rose either). and to prepare a bubble bath i needed to use more than half a bottle of \\&quot;bubble bath\\&quot; and still there weren&#x27;t enough bubbles. and the bubbles didn&#x27;t last for long, they lasted for like 5-10 minutes after that it was all just water. Even though it seems like a good deal it&#x27;s not. I believe its a waste of money. Next time I&#x27;ll try a kids stuff as a bubble bath product I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
    <li> Yes!  The friend absolutely loved the gift set.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.</li>
    <li> The girlfriend loved it.</li>
    <li> looks just like the photograph, it is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love this and it so pretty sitting in my bathroom. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Too small for a presentation I want to use it for.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a last minute birthday gift for my mother-she loves it-perfect gift; delivered exactly on time!</li>
    <li> When I ordered it I thought it would be the size of a normal gift basket, bt it&#x27;s teeny tiny, very small. It was a gift for someone else but theres no way I&#x27;ll buy another one I the future. Better off to go to Walmart.</li>
    <li> the item was a gift for a family member. i learned after i had bougt the bath set that someone had already sent her a similar gift. so i had to return it.</li>
    <li> Arrived On Time and Un-Damaged. Exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I am told by the recipient that she loved it all.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend as a gift.  She absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Described great...packed well...it&#x27;s so cute...doesn&#x27;t take much room which I like being the bathroom is a bit small. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Everything smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my grand daughter  in law. She loved it . I can&#x27;t really say much else because she didn&#x27;t say much more. The delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> It was a surprise Christmas present for my sister,she said there wasn&#x27;t any clue as to who it was from,no name  from sender, but she loved the gift.</li>
    <li> It looks cool but it is way too small for the price plus the smell is not very strong.  Would have been better off buying a gift at Walmart.  Also the gift wrapping was a joke.  It was wrapped sloppily in shrink wrap, stuck in a box twice its size with a ribbon wrapped around the box.</li>
    <li> Bath tub is very flimsy, but nice selection of products. Could use a more substantial container.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the size of product. For the price I expected it to be a little larger. Looks pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> She&#x27;s loved it from the packaging all the way down to its scent. Great gift for a special lady. You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> This item was a gift. I have not actually seen it myself. I spoke with my daughter-in-law yesterday. She was very pleased. She loved the scent and found using it in her bath to be very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift. Friend was very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Bought this as birthday gift for my aunt, she just loved the gold tub! it was small, but very cute and charming</li>
    <li> What a great read for little ones. Super friendly and super fun! Can not wait to give this to my nephew for his birthday!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a coworker&#x27;s birthday and it was lovely.  The tub can be used for fun things in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Very unsatisfied with this product for that price. Quality of the soaps were not good</li>
    <li> Great Christmas Present for my mother</li>
    <li> Awesome set.... My friend truly enjoyed this set... Great price and quick delivery...</li>
    <li> The person all but ignored it.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a dear friend birthday, I have to say she was overjoyed. The tub and all in it are of high  quality. When she call me she couldn’t stop thanking me for this perfect present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She went wild over the smell, she told me she really feels the love in the scent.</li>
    <li> Daughter-in-law liked this present</li>
    <li> This was well received by my daughter in law. She has a big job chasing after my 2 grandsons and appreciates anything that gives her a relaxing moment. I will keep this in mind for my other daughter in law for xmas</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend. It was delivered on the date promised. She loved it!</li>
    <li> This was a very good choice for christmas. It was wrapped and put together very nicely, and arrived on time. My mother loved it.</li>
