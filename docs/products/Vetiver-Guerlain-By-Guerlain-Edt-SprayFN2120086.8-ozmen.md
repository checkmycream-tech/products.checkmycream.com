      <li>Still love it, although it hasn&#x27;t helped me with the ladies.</li>
      <li>Love the Geurlain fragrances--this one (Vetiver) has been around for years--</li>
      <li>This product lacks the freshness of the authentic fragrance and the undertones of tobacco and fruit.</li>
      <li>My answer to them is, if you had a better scent than this</li>
      <li>then more</li>
      <li>Now I sound like the guy from Men&#x27;s Warehouse!</li>
      <li>my favorite fragrance</li>
      <li>Most can&#x27;t remember the name...</li>
      <li>and SO glad I did.  </li>
      <li>People tend to do that more and more</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Try it and believe me, you and people around you will love the way you smell, I guarantee it.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>Guerlain is the best Vetiver I tryed much better than other brands.</li>
      <li>- subtlety is ALWAYS best, especially with this bold scent.</li>
      <li>easy going, breezy vetiver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll spare the fragrance notes, as it can be easily found on basenotes.net.</li>
      <li>This is the most delicious fragrance for only fabulous men -- highly recommend it!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been the best men&#x27;s fragrance for over half a century, with a discrete mix of lemon, vetiver, tobacco and pepper.</li>
      <li>Elegant, fresh and earthy....</li>
      <li>This is light years better than all the fresh, aquatic clones that are everywhere these days.</li>
      <li>Wow, Why do you smell so good?</li>
      <li>vetiver scent is a unique clean herbal, forest like scent.</li>
      <li>all the way.&lt;br /&gt;It is clean and bright and it lasts for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;There is no sweetness at all in this scent.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite</li>
      <li>The price is great and this is not a Davidoff Cool Water, or any other off the rack fragrance.</li>
      <li>If you like Vetiver&#x27;s this is one of my favorites and is a classic that you can wear for many years...</li>
      <li>read reviews about how much better the older formula was.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised because I love Guerlain fragrances.  </li>
      <li>A classic that once you understand it, it could easily become your signature fragrance.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and buy this fragrance right away.</li>
      <li>is a classic that is still relevant.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the scent of vetiver, but it is really hard to find in a women&#x27;s perfume where it is the dominant top note.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice clean fresh smell of subtle spices.  </li>
      <li>It has a very soothing and light scent of green, and not too strong.  </li>
      <li>The delicious  green aroma of Guerlain Vetiver was the most difficult to locate in the NYC market.  </li>
      <li>Much to my surprise</li>
      <li>Perhaps I should contact paypal or other to learn more about return or replacement options.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of a crisp early morning in a dense forest.</li>
      <li>The intensity of the scent from the bottle degrades with time.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a significantly noticeable difference between the last drops of the older bottle and the new one.</li>
      <li>An all time favorite, great size, will last a long time because this is one of those fragrances that, a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>My Fav.&lt;br /&gt;Haitian Vetiver (7 Virtues) floral, beautiful, hard to find in U.S.(Vet Extreme is very close substitute)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just returned from a trip oversees where I had sent shipments to my hotel and was pleasantly surprised at how large this bottle is upon opening it.  </li>
      <li>Extreme- very similar but more modern and spicy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, despite the authentic packaging, the fragrance itself is not the original Vetiver by Guerlain.</li>
      <li>I buy more of this EdT than any other, and I use several Creeds, Penhaligon fougeres.  </li>
      <li>purchase it again in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
      <li>Something in my old age triggered my memory and decided to get a new bottle.</li>
      <li>it DOESN&#x27;T, it smells like a DAINTY-FLOWERY OLD WOMENS PERFUME (not what I want my man to smell like).</li>
      <li>It is by far</li>
      <li>The lovely green scent is there; although it is a &amp;#34;man&#x27;s&amp;#34; cologne, it is not overwhelmingly so - just clean, green and fresh.</li>
      <li>i smell shower clean, woodsy, green and oriental.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered as I usually just go with the 3.4 oz bottle from the Duty Free shops.  </li>
      <li>As with any fragrance: if you fill an entire room with your scent you are wearing entirely too much.</li>
      <li>This lasts &amp;#60;10 seconds on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed this and the equivalent at a dept store (smaller size) on different wrists and there&#x27;s a clear difference in quality.</li>
      <li>classy, long lasting sillage&lt;br /&gt;Sel de Vetiver, TDC-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells like a forest.</li>
    <li> Have been using Guerlain Vetiver for over 36 years and as a result, the scent and I are indistinguishable.</li>
    <li> Guerlain is the best Vetiver I tryed much better than other brands.</li>
    <li> This is a man&#x27;s scent - the notion behind any fragrance is for it only to be hinted on the air or smelled by another person who gets close to you. One spray of this, maybe two will last all day long and lighten as the day passes. It&#x27;s weighty, musky, earthy with a hint of bergamot and a touch of green floral notes but very, very little. As with any fragrance: if you fill an entire room with your scent you are wearing entirely too much. People tend to do that more and more and it&#x27;s offensive whether it&#x27;s a $50 fragrance or $500 - subtlety is ALWAYS best, especially with this bold scent.</li>
    <li> Has to be my signature scent.  I buy more of this EdT than any other, and I use several Creeds, Penhaligon fougeres.  I think for me, this frag just wears well and fits my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> What can you say. It&#x27;s been the best men&#x27;s fragrance for over half a century, with a discrete mix of lemon, vetiver, tobacco and pepper. You know it&#x27;s good if even your dentist ask you what this wonderfully smelling scent is.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to cologne for years. I constantly get favorable comments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Exceptional fragance!!!&lt;br /&gt;The price is even better.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase it again in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> Excellent vintage fragance</li>
    <li> Great quality great Price and fast shipping !</li>
    <li> Just returned from a trip oversees where I had sent shipments to my hotel and was pleasantly surprised at how large this bottle is upon opening it.  I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered as I usually just go with the 3.4 oz bottle from the Duty Free shops.  I checked yesterday at the airport and a small bottle was running about $75..  this is a great value.  From the packaging and all-- I have no doubt that it is a legit product, not a copy.</li>
    <li> Great men&#x27;s fragrance</li>
    <li> This product has claims it smells similar to Chanel Allure Homme (mens) - it DOESN&#x27;T, it smells like a DAINTY-FLOWERY OLD WOMENS PERFUME (not what I want my man to smell like). I purchased it as a GIFT (noted on my Amazon account). Now, can&#x27;t return or replace it - Amazon claims it under &amp;#34;hazardous materials&amp;#34;, saying to dispose of it as such..............it is an EXPENSIVE product - DO NOT BUY IT FOR YOUR MAN!!!!!!! (*unless you enjoy a dainty, flowery smelling man). TERRIBLE PRODUCT GUARANTEE. Perhaps I should contact paypal or other to learn more about return or replacement options.</li>
    <li> My husband use this product all his life, so i decided to buy this time the product online vs going to the Guerlain store in Toronto. BIG MISTAKE!!! this is not the same product at all, the smell is horrible! I had to poor it down the sink.... i am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it was a gift!  HE LOVES IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised because I love Guerlain fragrances.  They are all very high quality and exquisite fragrances.  But, this one is an exception.  To me, it smelled like sweat.  Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but based on my experience I would not recommend it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guerlain Heritage and Habit Rouge and L&#x27;instant (or whatever it&#x27;s called) are all outstanding.  This one is just a not go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, 5 stars for Amazon for working so well with me on this issue!!!!!</li>
    <li> This one is a staple in my collection.  It has a nice clean fresh smell of subtle spices.  If you like Vetiver&#x27;s this is one of my favorites and is a classic that you can wear for many years... I&#x27;ve been wearing for over 15.</li>
    <li> This cologne is a great deal for the size and for the quality scent it delivers.&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews about how much better the older formula was. My answer to them is, if you had a better scent than this then more I envy you.&lt;br /&gt;The vetiver scent is a unique clean herbal, forest like scent. It&#x27;s green all the way.&lt;br /&gt;It is clean and bright and it lasts for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;There is no sweetness at all in this scent. or any dark scent like oud or leather.&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect scent to wear at work because it smells great, and it&#x27;s not invasive.&lt;br /&gt;When the scent is about to disappear it kind of smells like you are getting out of a swimming pool with chlorine in a summer day. For some it may not be a great feeling, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the scent of vetiver, but it is really hard to find in a women&#x27;s perfume where it is the dominant top note.  SO, took a chance on this one and SO glad I did.  The lovely green scent is there; although it is a &amp;#34;man&#x27;s&amp;#34; cologne, it is not overwhelmingly so - just clean, green and fresh. I have no problem using it and have received compliments at the office.</li>
    <li> Great product and fantastic prize.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. My son loves it and find it to be a great value for the money. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This lasts &amp;#60;10 seconds on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed this and the equivalent at a dept store (smaller size) on different wrists and there&#x27;s a clear difference in quality. Do not purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either i received a fake duplicate or this product has been turned... returning this immediately.</li>
    <li> Also called &amp;#34;The reference vetiver&amp;#34;, this fragrance is exceptionally crafted and beheld by its incredible quality. I&#x27;ll spare the fragrance notes, as it can be easily found on basenotes.net. I&#x27;ll instead remark on the emotional aspects - the moment you apply this perfume, you experience this transcendental abundance of earthyness. It reminds me of a crisp early morning in a dense forest. You can smell the freshness of the morning combined with the earthy aromas of the forest. It is a wonderful balance. Do yourself a favor and buy this fragrance right away. Forget the fashion brand name chemical weapons they sell in department stores; this fragrance is many levels beyond them. At $40 a bottle, you just can&#x27;t pass this up.</li>
    <li> A classic that once you understand it, it could easily become your signature fragrance. This is light years better than all the fresh, aquatic clones that are everywhere these days. This just reeks of class, refinement, confidence, and ability.</li>
    <li> The prince of men&#x27;s fragrance.... Elegant, fresh and earthy.... My absolute favorite</li>
    <li> This is the most delicious fragrance for only fabulous men -- highly recommend it!!  Actually, I thought it was my secret -- now you know!!</li>
    <li> It is the place to start for vetiver fragrances. I have sampled 3 dozen vetiver frags and this one is wonderful. If you had to blind buy one vet. frag. this is the one. If you like this then some other ones you must sample are:&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver Extreme- very similar but more modern and spicy.&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver Tonka- MMMMmmmm, this is the only frag I worn that people say Wow, Why do you smell so good? My Fav.&lt;br /&gt;Haitian Vetiver (7 Virtues) floral, beautiful, hard to find in U.S.(Vet Extreme is very close substitute)&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver Fatal, Atelier- spicy, warm&lt;br /&gt;Tom Ford Grey Vetiver- Well restrained for the boardroom&lt;br /&gt;Chanel Sycomore- absolutely beautiful stuff, elegant, pricey&lt;br /&gt;Lalique Encre Noire- Smlr to Sycomore but way cheaper and more synthetic smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Creed Orig. Vetiver- classy, long lasting sillage&lt;br /&gt;Sel de Vetiver, TDC- easy going, breezy vetiver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very nice aroma, very nice price!</li>
    <li> The delicious  green aroma of Guerlain Vetiver was the most difficult to locate in the NYC market.  Much to my surprise,  I never knew that a 6.8 ounce size existed.  This gift was received with great joy and will continue to add whiffs of hapiness in the coming  months.</li>
    <li> Love this. I stole a bottle from my dad 45 years ago and I have always loved this scent. Something in my old age triggered my memory and decided to get a new bottle. Nothing compares to this, but don&#x27;t spread the word. I want to be the only one around here using it.&lt;br /&gt;Oct 5 2017: I just received my second bottle. Next time I&#x27;ll order a smaller bottle. The intensity of the scent from the bottle degrades with time.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a significantly noticeable difference between the last drops of the older bottle and the new one. Still love it, although it hasn&#x27;t helped me with the ladies.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell,  because arrived broken,.</li>
    <li> This is for men, but also great for women.  It has a very soothing and light scent of green, and not too strong.  Perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> Love the Geurlain fragrances--this one (Vetiver) has been around for years--is a classic that is still relevant.  I get compliments when I wear this.</li>
    <li> why should men be the only targeted audience ?&lt;br /&gt;when i wear it i smell shower clean, woodsy, green and oriental.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my dad who has been using Vetiver for over 30 years. Unfortunately, despite the authentic packaging, the fragrance itself is not the original Vetiver by Guerlain. This product lacks the freshness of the authentic fragrance and the undertones of tobacco and fruit. It is very disappointing that the real Vetiver is getting harder to find and this is just another knockoff.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SCENT, I HAVE BEEN WEARING VETIVER  SINCE 1975, AND IT STILL SMELLS GREAT, AND WOMEN CAN WEAR IT ALSO. PERFECT,</li>
    <li> I came across Vetiver at Neiman Marcus and spend $110 on a bottle, same size. It is by far my favorite fragrance and I have people asking me all the time what I wear. Most can&#x27;t remember the name...lol...I use one to two pumps after the shower and smell it all day long. The price is great and this is not a Davidoff Cool Water, or any other off the rack fragrance. Try it and believe me, you and people around you will love the way you smell, I guarantee it. Now I sound like the guy from Men&#x27;s Warehouse!</li>
    <li> An all time favorite, great size, will last a long time because this is one of those fragrances that, a little goes a long way.</li>
