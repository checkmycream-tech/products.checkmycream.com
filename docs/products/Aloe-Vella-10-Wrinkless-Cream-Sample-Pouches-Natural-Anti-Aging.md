<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this as a &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; thing.  The reviews seemed hyped but I use a night cream anyway and the packets ween&#x27;t expensive. I like it!  It works as well as the high end stuff and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes as so many of them do.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought a sample before purchasing .  Not a fan at all</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible smell.  It was sticky on my face, just horrible product.  Threw it away!!</li>
    <li> Smells gross but takes ur eye wrinkles away.</li>
    <li> I use Aloe Vella Wrnkless Cream on my neck which has made my wrinkles less noticeable during the day and has worked better than other creams I have tried.</li>
    <li> Bought the sample packages as I wanted to use it before purchasing regular jar.  I gave a package to my sister to try, we love it..  It is a rich creamy smooth lotion that applies well.  It makes the WRINKLES fade and appear non existant.  I have noticed a big difference around my lips, the lines that appear and make your lipstick run (yuck I hate that !!!)- very much improved....Sister had a deep large wrinkle on one cheek , since using this cream it has plumped up and filled in, looks great...I will continue to purchase this item...</li>
    <li> So far so good. I opened one.</li>
    <li> no differnec noted after using</li>
    <li> It was starting to reduce the fine wrinkles.  I like it</li>
    <li> I like the cream.  It minimizes lines and wrinkles, especially at first.  Doesn&#x27;t make them go away, just minimizes.  Somehow, that cream just makes my skin look better overall.  I love getting it in the little packets --great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT like the company and am grateful to get it from Amazon.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d find some other product.</li>
    <li> This lotion is like MAGIC! After only two days, my skin looks younger!</li>
    <li> Bad smell !! Smells like a bad floor cleaner or something I can&#x27;t put my finger on it !!</li>
    <li> Yes, I like it a lot.  It smooths the fine lines, in one&#x27;s skin.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> While it may not work for everyone I like the results even though the smell is something like burnt hair coated in sugar. So only put it on at night when I know the smell wont bother me</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before BUT this product warrants me giving up my day job and working for the company who developed this! I cannot believe what this product delivered me in 3 short days: less wrinkles, smoother, younger appearance. Cannot wait to see how I look on day 30 given my coworkers are complimenting my skin on day 3 of my using this product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product at all,could see no difference! The smell is bad too!</li>
    <li> texture very nice. smell to strong</li>
    <li> They tell you to put the two creams together but do not say if it should be equal amounts or what</li>
    <li> I like the cream, especially the way it feels on my face. I can see somewhat of a difference. Fast service.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell and it does NOTHING! In fact is seemed to accentuate the wrinkles around my eyes! How awesome is that....NOT!</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this after seeing something in a magazine indicating that you should use this product, and put Aloe Vella AYUR 5 Skin Renewal Cream on top.  The key ingredient according to the magazine was allegedly the winter cherry extract, while the key ingredient mixed with this in the Ayur 5 is &amp;#34;gold water.&amp;#34;  According to the article (ad is more like it), these two products used together were the key to anti-aging without surgery.  Thank goodness for trial samples!  Even so, five packets of this and five packets of the Ayur 5 cost $8.95 shipping and handling.  My wife used these on her face for a few days, and while it did not break out her sensitive skin, she noticed that her pores were looking somewhat larger and clogged.  As such, she discontinued use and went back to her old products.  But not a quitter, my wife decided to use the creams on her left hand and arm, and did not use anything on the right hand and arm.  She is 52, spends a lot of time in the sun, and has quite a few sun spots.  After using the products in this manner, she could not see any difference in the reduction of sun spots on the left arm.  Not a miracle, at least for her.</li>
    <li> terrible!!!! no results and smells and feels bad.</li>
    <li> very thick doesn,t improve skin appearance</li>
    <li> Used religiously for weeks, didn&#x27;t notice much change if any. Way over priced.&lt;br /&gt;Still have some left.&lt;br /&gt;Just my opinion</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> wasted $$, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Too much fragrance for me.  I have allergies to strong scents.</li>
    <li> I found the cream very dry,did not get any results</li>
