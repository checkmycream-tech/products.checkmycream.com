      <li>and this is the best!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I can order it from here</li>
      <li>LOL.</li>
      <li>It is the best and makes you feel and smell so good. :)</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, Great lather, great scent.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a good size.</li>
      <li>It rinses off very easy leaving skin feeling great.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell!</li>
      <li>I would buy it more often!</li>
      <li>My favorite body wash yet!</li>
      <li>I love soap and gloary products and this one was good.</li>
      <li>This smells pretty good, suds ups nicely, and Stephenson&#x27;s Online is a great place to buy these products.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s of great consistency and in truth, I feel that it&#x27;s way better than the Clean</li>
      <li>I love me some Soap and Glory......</li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
      <li>Love this line.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite body wash.  </li>
      <li>Also, the scent seems to linger which I love.</li>
      <li>but it is okay.</li>
      <li>i like just don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>When I am done with this bottle, I&#x27;ll buy some Clean on Me, YO!</li>
      <li>Lather up great, so smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>But my favorite remains Clean on Me.....</li>
      <li>But, if you love this brand and use Clean on Me, then nothing will probably compare aroma-wise for you.</li>
      <li>Hands down, the best scent there is provided from Soap &amp; Glory.</li>
      <li>thing that strucks me the most about this product is that it almost exactly smells like Disney&#x27;s almond/pecan glazed nuts!</li>
      <li>It suds up nicely and smells really divine.</li>
      <li>Body wash smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>however I was really excited with Amazon</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I bought the whole line.</li>
      <li>specially after exices .</li>
      <li>I really wanted to try this because I love Soap and Glory&#x27;s Clean on Me.</li>
      <li>I love it so much .</li>
      <li>We love it so much that I&#x27;m ordering another bottle so we can have one in each bath.  </li>
      <li>after shower I am so relax with the sweet smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of sweet and florally when you wash, but when you&#x27;re dry it just smells very clean.</li>
      <li>Most fragrances and scents don&#x27;t stay no where near as long and as great as this body wash</li>
      <li>Soap and Glory is such a fun brand and their products are really effective as well.</li>
      <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It has such a nice creamy texture.</li>
      <li>It left my skin very clean and nice soft scent.  </li>
      <li>Super quick international ship, accurate in filling orders and thoughtful packing.</li>
      <li>They smell and feel great, and usually do what they promise.  </li>
      <li>It smells very delicious, and the scent seriously lingers on my young &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; skin!</li>
      <li>Received it fast!</li>
      <li>I was looking for this type of scent to try something different because I usually use light, floral and sweet aromas, but this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>It kind of reminds me of the Britney Spear&#x27;s perfume (Fantasy I think), but more grown up and expensive.</li>
      <li>i expected it to get more foamy, as the name implies, but the wash itself is sooooo creamy and smells delish.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was only available in the U.K.</li>
      <li>so you have to pump a bunch more times and before you know it youve used about half the bottle in a weeks time.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight and dry after using and so far the pumps have worked great on both bottles.</li>
      <li>and it cost the same of not less than it would cost me to order and ship it if available in the USA.  </li>
      <li>I live in Florida to know that!&lt;br /&gt;XD</li>
      <li>The bottle is big and will last a long time, I love Soap and Glory products.</li>
      <li>Very luxurious product that I would definitely repurchase</li>
      <li>it leaves my skin fairly soft and the scent lingers.</li>
      <li>Not too soft like some body washes.</li>
      <li>it left my skin very soft and the smell is not over powering.</li>
      <li>This body wash smells so good and lathers like crazy.  </li>

<li> I was so sad when Target stop selling this brand</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased a ton of soaps, even some really expensive ones</li>

    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about Soap and Glory products.  Have never bought anything I didn&#x27;t like.  They smell and feel great, and usually do what they promise.  Love this line.</li>
    <li> I love it so much . specially after exices . after shower I am so relax with the sweet smell</li>

    <li> i like just don&#x27;t love it. it leaves my skin fairly soft and the scent lingers. it lathers enough and the scent was not exactly what i expected but it is okay. i like the packaging. i might try different scents eventually.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best scent there is provided from Soap &amp; Glory. It smells very delicious, and the scent seriously lingers on my young &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; skin! LOL. Imagine. Most fragrances and scents don&#x27;t stay no where near as long and as great as this body wash and this isn&#x27;t even a lotion! How awesome is that?! I was looking for this type of scent to try something different because I usually use light, floral and sweet aromas, but this stuff is amazing. I think it&#x27;s of great consistency and in truth, I feel that it&#x27;s way better than the Clean On Me shower gel. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that strucks me the most about this product is that it almost exactly smells like Disney&#x27;s almond/pecan glazed nuts!

    <li> Body wash smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash yet! It makes me look forward to showers. Very luxurious product that I would definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> I ordered just one bottle for me and my daughter (who is 17) to try.  We love it so much that I&#x27;m ordering another bottle so we can have one in each bath.  My husband even likes it.  A little goes a long way.  I even used it shave with.  Worked the same if not better than any shaving cream or gel.  I wish they sold this in the USA.  I&#x27;m so happy that I can order it from here and it cost the same of not less than it would cost me to order and ship it if available in the USA.  Lather up great, so smooth and soft.  It rinses off very easy leaving skin feeling great.  Not too soft like some body washes.</li>
    <li> i expected it to get more foamy, as the name implies, but the wash itself is sooooo creamy and smells delish. i shave with this and my skin is like BUTTA after. recommend!</li>
    <li> My second bottle. Creamy sudsy lather that smells like cake batter and oatmeal cookie. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight and dry after using and so far the pumps have worked great on both bottles.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say, as long as they&#x27;re making this soap I will never use another one again. I&#x27;ve purchased a ton of soaps, even some really expensive ones and this is the best!  I do not like any of the other S&amp;G scents but if can&#x27;t get enough of this one. It&#x27;s kind of sweet and florally when you wash, but when you&#x27;re dry it just smells very clean. Also, the scent seems to linger which I love.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells so good and lathers like crazy.  It left my skin very clean and nice soft scent.  It will last a long time. It has such a nice creamy texture.</li>
    <li> Received it fast! Love the smell!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, Great lather, great scent. I just wish it was only available in the U.K. I would buy it more often!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this because I love Soap and Glory&#x27;s Clean on Me. I was really disappointed , maybe I got part of a bad batch because it has almost no scent and doesn&#x27;t make the suds that you get with Clean on Me. I&#x27;ll keep it to use as hand soap.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body wash.  I use this and the Righteous Body Lotion instead of heavy perfume.  It is the best and makes you feel and smell so good. :)</li>
    <li> Soap and Glory is such a fun brand and their products are really effective as well. I was so sad when Target stop selling this brand however I was really excited with Amazon started to sell it. Its worth every penny. I loved it so much I bought the whole line. I used this while on vacation and I did not need to apply any lotion after my shower it left my skin very soft and the smell is not over powering.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of different bathroom products, but this one takes the cake. It suds up nicely and smells really divine. It kind of reminds me of the Britney Spear&#x27;s perfume (Fantasy I think), but more grown up and expensive. The bottle is big and will last a long time, I love Soap and Glory products.</li>
