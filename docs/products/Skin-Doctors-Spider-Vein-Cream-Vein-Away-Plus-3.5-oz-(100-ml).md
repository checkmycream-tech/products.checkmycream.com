    <li> I used this product faithfully for over a month with little or not difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product was useless.  It is a water of money.  No results or changes.  Do not waste any money on it.</li>
    <li> Why I just gave it 4 not 5 stars...I just received this product and have been using it for less than 1 week... give me some time...  If someone is going to purchase this, I suggest that they purchase 2 tubes of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful and is not the least bit greasy.  I will let you know if it works, after a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  There are no&lt;br /&gt;benefits from regular use, that I could see.  Just more&lt;br /&gt;snake oil in a jar, I should have known better!</li>
    <li> I note the changes on my legs over time.  I have gone through three jars now and see the difference.  I am using after the shower in the AM and that seems to be enough application.  I recommend it for all the claims they make!  Yah!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cream. I was skeptical at first, and it took some time before I saw results, but now I&#x27;ll never be without a jar! The spider veins are nearly gone &amp; it is helping to eliminate veins that are WAY beyond the spider stage! Very noticeable improvement. Do yourself a favor &amp; use it, just have some patience... it will work!</li>
    <li> This product does not work...don&#x27;t waste your money.. you will just be giving your money away...They got me once, and that was one time too many..you can&#x27;t say that you were not warn....</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this product to keep the skin on the tops of his hands from bruising so easily. It&#x27;s one product he uses religiously. He even wants to take it to the hospital this week where he is scheduled for surgery</li>
    <li> I used the product, but didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in the spider veins in my legs.  If it helped it was minimal at best.  I would probably require longer usage than using just one jar.</li>
    <li> This product did wonders for my embarrassing spider veins. I recommend this cream highly and the results for me is WOW!!</li>
    <li> THE imagen is not THE same version</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results yet</li>
    <li> Better than any product of this kind that I have used.</li>
    <li> I only took this for one month last summer and I couldnt believe it actually worked.Wish other products lived up to expectations.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It takes a few weeks (3-4) to see any results, but it is definitely worth the wait!! I  can&#x27;t wait to see how well it is after a few more weeks!</li>
    <li> I suffered from broken veins in my ankle while wearing a cast for my broken foot.  The cream helped to soothe the ankle.</li>
    <li> does not take away spider veins</li>
    <li> I have been using for awhile now, it does not do as expected. Will not be purchasing again. would not recommend</li>
