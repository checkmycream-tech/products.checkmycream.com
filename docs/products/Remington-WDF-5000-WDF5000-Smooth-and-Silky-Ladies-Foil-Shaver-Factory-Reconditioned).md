      <li>I have truly enjoyed this razor and have had it for many years..</li>

      <li>I love my shaver.  </li>
      <li>Thought remington would be better.</li>
      <li>Love this shaver.  </li>
      <li>It is a terrific shaver that handles anything I throw at it, and it has worked wonderfully for somewhere around 3 years, now.  </li>
      <li>that free delivery--hated to see the $35 limit increase but still reasonable--just have to wait and order more things together.</li>
      <li>&amp; refurbished working fine &amp; is cheaper than buying replacement head/blades.  </li>
      <li>I have since purchased another brand, which seems fine.</li>
      <li>but it looks smooth and gone.</li>
      <li>I bought this replace a newer model of the Remington Smooth and Silky Razor.</li>
      <li>I bought this model for my wife because it was one of the last Great Shavers Built by Reminigton.  </li>
      <li>Smooth &amp; Silky Ladies</li>
      <li>I ordered the replacement cutter and foil linked to this item and it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>It is indeed Smooth and Silky and the newer model was scratchy and pulled.as it shaved.</li>
      <li>are No where near as good.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t shave close, blades dulled quickly, more work than it was worth since you had to go over and over the same area to do any good, etc.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, I had to clean and disinfect it myself, and will never buy refurbished again.  </li>
      <li>My last one was good for 10 years.  </li>
      <li>I bought it to shave my intimate area, so I can only give the review on how well it shaves there, and it does shave wonderful, its not silky smooth like with a hand held normal razor, it leave a feeling of a one day growth</li>
      <li>, right?  </li>
      <li>I like an old fashioned electric shaver and this one works just fine.  </li>
      <li>So after trying many different styles, I found this.  </li>
      <li>I had owned several Remingtons and have been satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Just be aware that there may be some wear on this product.</li>
      <li>My daughter has MS and anything that makes her life easier is a real bonus.  </li>
      <li>Really cannot rate this product.  </li>
      <li>I tried out this shaver I ended up bleeding from both armpits (even on the gentle setting), a fact I explained to Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It works very well.  </li>
      <li>Bought many other types/brands and &amp; this 6 blade beats them</li>
      <li>I am going to buy a second one, just because I love it so much and don&#x27;t want to be without when this one finally wears out.  </li>
      <li>As an older lady, I was trying to make my life easier.  </li>
      <li>Decent</li>
      <li>Amazon quickly sent instructions on how to send it back (returned to \\&quot;Shragy bender\\&quot;?)  </li>
      <li>The batteries (at least in mine) are ni-cad, and have done amazingly well - no loss of charge or anything that one normally thinks of with ni-cad batteries.  </li>
      <li>I just wished we could have replaced the screen and not bought a new one.</li>
      <li>We could buy another  for the price of new battery and screen head and cutters.</li>
      <li>Product looked and worked like Brand New</li>
      <li>Times have changed the New shavers from Remington</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use on wet or dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I have used the WD5000 models for the past 10 years and absolutely love them.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>old daughter has taken over it</li>
      <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t really remember ever running it completely flat.    </li>
      <li>No soap, no water, no mess.  </li>
      <li>Out of desperation I actually took my old one apart (which was a challenge), purchased a new battery, and got it up and running.  </li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel like messing with sending it back and waiting for a new one to arrive</li>
      <li>only one contained the little brush to clean the blades with.</li>
      <li>Since they apparently don&#x27;t make them anymore, I ordered one of these for myself &amp; one for a friend.</li>
      <li>After many failed attempts, this one seems to be similar to my old razor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product, my wife is very impressed with the results. this is the second one we have purchased ( !st lasted 3 years. We could buy another  for the price of new battery and screen head and cutters. recommended purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver.  I purchased it the 1st time over  17 years ago.  My 16 yr. old daughter has taken over it so I ordered this one as a back up.  This order came on time.  Remington should remake this shaver. I have tried their newer models and they do not stand up to this one.</li>
    <li> I bought my Remington shaver about 6 months ago.  As an older lady, I was trying to make my life easier.  Wow!  I loved it. No soap, no water, no mess.  My daughter has MS and anything that makes her life easier is a real bonus.  So, I bought the very same shaver for her.  You guessed it.  She loves it too.  Is there anything you can&#x27;t buy at Amazon.com?</li>
    <li> I have truly enjoyed this razor and have had it for many years..Does an excellent job...I would recommend this product to any woman..</li>
    <li> I actually received my WDF-5000 from a lady on FreeCycle who had received it as a gift and never used it.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be too great, but - hey, it was free, right?  WRONG!  It is a terrific shaver that handles anything I throw at it, and it has worked wonderfully for somewhere around 3 years, now.  The last electric shaver I had (women&#x27;s) was a bit of a bust - didn&#x27;t shave close, blades dulled quickly, more work than it was worth since you had to go over and over the same area to do any good, etc.  I actually used a man&#x27;s shaver for quite a while, as the men&#x27;s seemed to shave closer/better than the woman&#x27;s models did.  This one doesn&#x27;t go as close as a blade, but easily as close as the BEST men&#x27;s shaver I ever used, if not a bit better. I didn&#x27;t know it was wet/dry (remember how I got it), but now will start using it in the tub as well.  I am going to buy a second one, just because I love it so much and don&#x27;t want to be without when this one finally wears out.  The batteries (at least in mine) are ni-cad, and have done amazingly well - no loss of charge or anything that one normally thinks of with ni-cad batteries.  I get several shaves off of a single charge.  In fact, I don&#x27;t really remember ever running it completely flat.    So I give this shaver an unreserved 5 stars, and wish that Remington still made them!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t make this model any longer.  It works very well.  I had one that lasted forever and finally broke.  I purchased 2 of the same razor from Amazon for this reason.  Products from Amazon work perfectly at a very good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this replace a newer model of the Remington Smooth and Silky Razor. It is indeed Smooth and Silky and the newer model was scratchy and pulled.as it shaved.</li>
    <li> Do not buy! Leaves lots of stubble. Daughter unhappy! Tried both wet and dry...same effect. Try something else! Thought remington would be better.</li>
    <li> I had a previous one for over 10 years and it  broke. It was a great shaver. This one is just as good. I bought a back up in case it breaks.</li>
    <li> I had this shaver for many years and it worked wonderfully.  when it finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; i couldn&#x27;t find another one that did as well.  So after trying many different styles, I found this.  I am so happy and it works so well.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002EHQ3D0 Remington WDF-5000 WDF5000 Smooth &amp; Silky Ladies Foil Shaver Factory Reconditioned)]]&lt;br /&gt;When I tried out this shaver I ended up bleeding from both armpits (even on the gentle setting), a fact I explained to Amazon.  Amazon quickly sent instructions on how to send it back (returned to \\&quot;Shragy bender\\&quot;?)  However, then I had to pay return postage.  Up to that point, I wasn&#x27;t going to complain online, but now... DO NOT BUY!!  I have since purchased another brand, which seems fine.</li>
    <li> I tried using another Remington model because Walmarts were out of the WD5000.  I used it for about 3 weeks and absolutely hated it.  Returned it to the store.  Out of desperation I actually took my old one apart (which was a challenge), purchased a new battery, and got it up and running.  I was estatic when I found one on line which I purchased from you and have it as a spare.  I have used the WD5000 models for the past 10 years and absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> I forgot how great this shaver is. I guess I am not the only 70+ lady that gets chin whiskers. Amazing no fuzz  and no pain.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington products for almost  30 years  Victor Kiam was President of the company and they were made in the U S A  Times have changed the New shavers from Remington are No where near as good.  I bought this model for my wife because it was one of the last Great Shavers Built by Reminigton.  The Refurb job was GREAT  Product looked and worked like Brand New</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago &amp; it worked GREAT. Since they apparently don&#x27;t make them anymore, I ordered one of these for myself &amp; one for a friend. They work fine, but the storage/travel bag that comes with them were dirty &amp; only one contained the little brush to clean the blades with. Just be aware that there may be some wear on this product. Again IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> Best lady&#x27;s shaver on the market--for women with hair thicker than &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.  Been using this shaver for 30 yrs. &amp; refurbished working fine &amp; is cheaper than buying replacement head/blades.  Bought many other types/brands and &amp; this 6 blade beats them all even those removal lotions--returned or gave others away.  Quick delivery &amp; excellent service as always from Amazon--&amp; love that free delivery--hated to see the $35 limit increase but still reasonable--just have to wait and order more things together.</li>
    <li> This is the shaver (#2) that I have enjoyed for many years.  When the mfgr. discontinues service, or accessories, then&lt;br /&gt;the consumer must &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; another product.  Even this refurbished one will probably last me another 10 years or longer.&lt;br /&gt;It is most convenient for me to dry-shave in the morning, and then apply lotion to my legs.  I don&#x27;t have to concern myself with a slippery shower or tub.</li>
    <li> FYI - I have this shaver and I love it and it works great!  I ordered the replacement cutter and foil linked to this item and it doesn&#x27;t fit. Now that it is opened I can&#x27;t return it.  Wanted to let everyone know, so no one else gets stuck with something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product.  It&#x27;s great when it works.  My son says he thinks it&#x27;s being over charged sitting in the stand all the time.  I don&#x27;t know about that, I think Remmington would have a safety inside so this doesn&#x27;t happen.  It&#x27;s just that sometimes it works &amp; sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  I never know when I&#x27;m going to have to resort to the razor again.  That usually happens, of course, when I&#x27;m in a hurry!</li>
    <li> I ordered this, but didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.  I got, I believe, the newer version.  It&#x27;s been working well but only has the one trimmer head instead of two like the WDF-5000.  I still think the WDF-5000 gave me a closer shave than what this seller sent me but I didn&#x27;t feel like messing with sending it back and waiting for a new one to arrive so I just kept it.</li>
    <li> I like an old fashioned electric shaver and this one works just fine.  I thought I was getting a shaver with two cutting edges, but the one I received has only one (plus the center foils) so I rated it a 4 instead of a 5.  I have had the shaver a couple of months and it holds it&#x27;s charge well.</li>
    <li> Within a few weeks the battery would no longer hold enough charge to complete a single shaving session. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I understand the shaver is factory serviced, but it was not cleaned.  I was considering returning it, but decided not to because I like the shaver.  I had owned several Remingtons and have been satisfied.  Therefore, I had to clean and disinfect it myself, and will never buy refurbished again.  The seller should investigate any product they sell.</li>
    <li> I love my shaver.  It is very easy to use on wet or dry skin.  My last one was good for 10 years.  I just wished we could have replaced the screen and not bought a new one.</li>
    <li> Really cannot rate this product.  I order a WDF-5000 and was shipped a WDF-5500 which is different.  Did not open the package and got authorization to return it which I did, but my account was not credited.  I had to submit a dispute.</li>
    <li> The shaver lasted a little over 3 years. I bought it because it had dual voltage for use overseas. Decent</li>
    <li> My old remington wet and dry shaver I got in 2002, broke....so I&#x27;ve been searching for a razor to replace it. After many failed attempts, this one seems to be similar to my old razor. It does not pull my hair and hurt like the newer ones I&#x27;ve bought and it does its job. I bought it to shave my intimate area, so I can only give the review on how well it shaves there, and it does shave wonderful, its not silky smooth like with a hand held normal razor, it leave a feeling of a one day growth but it looks smooth and gone.</li>
    <li> I was shipped the newer model. It&#x27;s ok but I would have preferred the purple model as that Was the model I previously owned. It was definitely  nicer to holds and A bit heavier.</li>
