<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell is stronger than white thing.&lt;br /&gt;It is good for my foot.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the red one. I have used the small Ultra strength for a very long time. Love it even takes away Sciatica pain I&#x27;ve been told. I use it for my lower back and shoulders when gardening. But mine doesn&#x27;t stain. Now someone just mentioned this does. I&#x27;ve also used it on my leg muscles. It just works when you hurt. That&#x27;s it in a nut shell. Just had to mention this too. This morning I had a charlie horse cramp all down my leg. I could have screemed. I rubbed tiger balm on and within minutes the cramp was gone. So far it hasn&#x27;t stained my socks I don&#x27;t think. Hard to tell their black. Tiger balm follows me every where. Love it.</li>
    <li> Nothing works better for aches and pains!  Magic stuff from the orient!  They know how to take care of pains!</li>
    <li> Nothing better!  Been using it for years and the company is excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s my go too. Relieves pain and my headaches.</li>
    <li> I never knew this existed until I got into Muay Thai Kickboxing...and I have used the TB White for years, but this red is the best.  I am sticking to TB Red for life.</li>
    <li> I love this ointment!  My daughter-in-law bought me a small jar at her local Wal-Mart to see if it would help with my Rheumatoid Arthritis.  Because of the medications I currently take for my RA, I am always on the lookout for natural remedies.  The Red Tiger Balm has certainly been a good buy.  Although it won&#x27;t cure my RA, it sure does help with some of the pain.  It works great on sore muscles and joints!</li>
    <li> A bit hotter once you applied it on your achy body but it works great.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing to bear in mind is the Red Tiger Balm will stain clothes, but its pain relief is worth it.  This stuff beats all the other over-the-counter stuff out there, trust me, I have tried everything.  Very long lasting as well.  One other thing I noticed, if I have a sinus headache, I rub a tiny bit on my temples - poof - headache gone!  Great product - just sorry it took me so long to find it.</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say is try it and see for yourself. This works fast  and deep</li>
    <li> This works, glad to have found on Amazon</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used tiger balm for years, it&#x27;s great for bruises, achy muscles, headaches and even sinus pressure.  Nice to get the larger size jar.</li>
    <li> I love it, works on my pain</li>
    <li> The jar was a small jar not a 30 0z jar as advertised</li>
    <li> Thank You.All OK.&lt;br /&gt;Brgds,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of analgesic products but always go back to Tiger Balm.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed. I can barely feel it where I&#x27;ve applied it. I can get a bit of the sensation if I continuously rub it in. I can&#x27;t believe I paid this much for a product that is useless!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, overall.  Big jar.  I like the cinnamon-y smell of the Red, which I had never tried before. It&#x27;s a really strong smell, so I usually use it in the evening, when I know I won&#x27;t be going out in public for a while.  But personally, I find it pleasant. It&#x27;s great on sore muscles and joints. You only need a little bit, and I suspect this jar will last me a really long time.&lt;br /&gt; I also tried it on my temples for a headache, and on my upper lip to help with nasal congestion, but I did not like it for these purposes.  It was just too strong, and the sensation when placed on my face was actually painful.  I assume this is because of the higher sensitivity of the skin there.  I&#x27;ll probably get a little tin of Tiger Balm White for headaches.</li>
    <li> Good salve. Better than Ben-Gay in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love tiger balm. It just works.</li>
    <li> It works good, but $12.95 is over priced...you can get 18 g at Target for $4.50. I guess if you need it delivered to your door, you pay for it. I like the clear one better.</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm really does the trick.  The penetrating formula goes on smoothly and gets relief to the area quickly.</li>
    <li> Used to use this when I was in the army for aches and pains...still looks, feels and smell the same as i remember. Much preferred than linanment</li>
    <li> We have used tiger balm in the past and this purchase met our expectations.  We are very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Torn meniscus.  This product gave me more relief than just about anything besides Rx narcotics.</li>
