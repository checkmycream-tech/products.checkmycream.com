      <li>This razor is a good razor.</li>
      <li>good no blades were sent</li>

      <li>Over all a good way to see if you like this shaving system but could be cheaper given the blade situation.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>The razor is nicely balanced.  </li>
      <li>Maybe not the best to start with, but a great second razor.</li>
      <li>Best straight razor that I ever used.</li>
      <li>It fits nicely in my hand.  </li>
      <li>comfortable to hold though and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The blades fit perfect</li>
      <li>I used halved Feather blades in this, and I barely have words to express how impressed I am.</li>
      <li>Does not look or feel cheap, has a good weight and easy to install blades.</li>
      <li>I love this razor.</li>
      <li>For the money I don&#x27;t believe you can get a better razor.  </li>
      <li>and I love these razors.  </li>
      <li>i would like the blad to b more exposed.</li>
      <li>it would have be better if it was a bit heavier.</li>
      <li>With this and the Feathers, I get as close of a shave with the grain as I did going against the grain with a Mach 5, and with much more comfort.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t found any thing better.  </li>
      <li>but ok for now the blade lock rivet head is deteriorating</li>
      <li>3 stars, would&#x27;ve got 5 stars with better blade exposed.</li>
      <li>Let me start out by saying this shavette is pretty good,</li>
      <li>and they have really great customer service i received my new razor and its showing problems</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this razor, and will be ordering more MD Barber products (this was my first - I am a straight-razor user, not a barber).  </li>
      <li>:) This thing can create incredibly neat sharp edges around the head, on forehead and sides.</li>
      <li>Great product especially for the price.</li>
      <li>so I know cheap when I see it.</li>
      <li>The handle looks cheap but come on the razor</li>
      <li>Made of plastic which felt cheap.</li>
      <li>The heavy weight is perfect.  </li>
      <li>As I get more comfortable with straight razor shaving, I will upgrade, but I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I use it on my friend and give him the full barber experience.</li>
      <li>The blade-holder leaves are well-finished, of what appears to be a very high-quality stainless steel, and the scales are also nicely finished.  </li>
      <li>For the price it is a complete rip off and looks nowhere near as nice as these lovely photos and reviews make it seem.</li>
      <li>It takes time to put a blade on, but the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>I own 4 different ones.</li>
      <li>the one I got was not closing right.</li>
      <li>I wish there was a little more blade exposure, but for a beginner, this may be for the better.  </li>
      <li>Good razor,the handle could be a little thicker and heavier.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>Loading a blade was a little more tricky than the Mr. C razor I&#x27;m used to, the blades are a lot thinner too, and since the Dragon is stainless steel, I think it&#x27;ll hold up better and not corrode being dipped in and out of barbercide between clients.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m extremely satisfied</li>
      <li>I found this razor to be of far higher build-quality than that of a recently-purchased (and quickly returned) P***er brand razor.</li>
      <li>get a parker straight razor</li>
      <li>For the money, you absolutely cannot beat this product.  </li>
      <li>the &#x27;&#x27;gold&#x27;&#x27; handle rivets are rusted but im on the coast and really humid</li>
      <li>I have been using a straight razor for 9 years</li>
      <li>I am a novice, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare against.  </li>
      <li>Holds the blade very well.</li>
      <li>The scales are plastic, yes, but they must be high-grade plastic, as it&#x27;s heavier than the stainless steel Parker.</li>
      <li>At least it would look good in a collection if I didn&#x27;t like using it.</li>
      <li>I do have to say that it is a lot better than the some of the other shavettes out there on the market.</li>
      <li>I also have a very expensive Feather Razor and it&#x27;s excellent but costs over $100.  </li>
      <li>Once you do, however, the added weight is great for coarse, thick beards like mine.</li>
      <li>blade does not fit properly good for shaving neck and sideburns only it will cut up your face</li>
      <li>Although the razor is quality made, sturdy handle, has a weight to it, and the stainless steel is nice, the blade exposure sucks.</li>
      <li>Im not a razor expert, but I do collect high end knives</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I see some fixed blade straight razors out there that are hundreds of dollars.  </li>
      <li>but that makes the blade slides smoothly on your skin with minimal effort</li>
      <li>figured I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
      <li>Their \\&quot;Elite\\&quot; razor has more blade exposure, but still not satisfied.</li>
      <li>For those of you wanting the straight razor experience, without the sharpening maintenance, LOOK NO FURTHER!!  </li>
      <li>This obviously is not that high end.  </li>
      <li>I started wet shaving with a stainless steel Parker SR1, and thought that I would never stray.</li>
      <li>The handle looks like it was made with one of those crappy 3d printers and can barely support the metal razor.  </li>
      <li>The pins that hold the blade are a little stubbier than the Parker&#x27;s, so you have to use a little more care loading the blade, especially if you&#x27;re using the unholy-sharp Feather blades.</li>
      <li>The MD Master Razor is simple to use, takes a half of a double edged razor blade, has a surgical stainless steel blade arm, with a third rivet in the center of the handle for sturdy long life, this razor should be much higher in price for the quality and customer service.  </li>

<li> As a barber I&#x27;m always curious about different tools.  </li>
<li> the black dragon is the same thing just painted and double the price.</li>
<li> the blade exposure sucks not worth it at all this or the md black dragon wouldn&#x27;t refer to anyone and it sounds like the first two reviews are from the makers them selves read my review</li>
<li> If I had found these razors first I would never have bought the expensive Feather.</li>
<li> It gives this extremely close shave, so</li>
<li> This one heavier than my other razors</li>
<li> This has got to be, hands down, one of the finest shaving instruments for the price that I have ever used, and use every day.  </li>
<li> I read a few of the other reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
<li> I have the Master and the Black Dragon</li>
<li> the black dragons a ripoff</li>
<li> The blade holder itself is slightly bulkier and heavier, which takes a little bit of getting used to.</li>
<li> A bit heavy in the front</li>
<li> they are way better then this crap !!!</li>
<li> Not a very good hold on the blade.</li>
<li> This is seriously the cheapest flimsiest piece of crap i could have bought.</li>
<li> so you avoid cutting yourself.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this razor. I use it on my friend and give him the full barber experience. :) This thing can create incredibly neat sharp edges around the head, on forehead and sides. It gives this extremely close shave, so even the fanciest electric shaver will not do this for you. Great purchase, love it!</li>
    <li> this razor is trash i spent 40 bucks for nothing and sent it back the blade exposure sucks not worth it at all this or the md black dragon wouldn&#x27;t refer to anyone and it sounds like the first two reviews are from the makers them selves read my review get a parker straight razor they are way better then this crap !!!</li>
    <li> Although the razor is quality made, sturdy handle, has a weight to it, and the stainless steel is nice, the blade exposure sucks. 3 stars, would&#x27;ve got 5 stars with better blade exposed. Already returned. Their \\&quot;Elite\\&quot; razor has more blade exposure, but still not satisfied.</li>
    <li> This has got to be, hands down, one of the finest shaving instruments for the price that I have ever used, and use every day.  Customer service is unequalled anywhere, period.  The MD Master Razor is simple to use, takes a half of a double edged razor blade, has a surgical stainless steel blade arm, with a third rivet in the center of the handle for sturdy long life, this razor should be much higher in price for the quality and customer service.  For those of you wanting the straight razor experience, without the sharpening maintenance, LOOK NO FURTHER!!  This is what you&#x27;ve been wanting, trust me! Order today!</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving with a stainless steel Parker SR1, and thought that I would never stray. I got this on a whim, figured I&#x27;d try something new. At least it would look good in a collection if I didn&#x27;t like using it. Admittedly, it feels different than the Parker. The scales are plastic, yes, but they must be high-grade plastic, as it&#x27;s heavier than the stainless steel Parker. The blade holder itself is slightly bulkier and heavier, which takes a little bit of getting used to. Once you do, however, the added weight is great for coarse, thick beards like mine. I used halved Feather blades in this, and I barely have words to express how impressed I am. With this and the Feathers, I get as close of a shave with the grain as I did going against the grain with a Mach 5, and with much more comfort. The pins that hold the blade are a little stubbier than the Parker&#x27;s, so you have to use a little more care loading the blade, especially if you&#x27;re using the unholy-sharp Feather blades. My verdict- an excellent razor, and beautiful to boot. Maybe not the best to start with, but a great second razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is a good razor. the black dragon is the same thing just painted and double the price. if you&#x27;re gonna choice md. go with this one. the black dragons a ripoff</li>
    <li> This is seriously the cheapest flimsiest piece of crap i could have bought. The handle looks like it was made with one of those crappy 3d printers and can barely support the metal razor.  It feels like it just collapses under the weight of holding it in your hand.  DO NOT BUY THIS.  For the price it is a complete rip off and looks nowhere near as nice as these lovely photos and reviews make it seem.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying this shavette is pretty good, the one I got was not closing right. I did not want to bother with ordering another one. So I returned it and got my money back. I do have to say that it is a lot better than the some of the other shavettes out there on the market.</li>
    <li> Not a very good hold on the blade. And the blade tensioner came off after two times after changing the blade. But it dose the job just take a minute or two extra to change the blade</li>
    <li> Good razor,the handle could be a little thicker and heavier.&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable to hold though and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The blades fit perfect</li>
    <li> i had to send one back already the rivet on the blade lock broke and they have really great customer service i received my new razor and its showing problems but ok for now the blade lock rivet head is deteriorating i don&#x27;t know why maybe the barbicide is doing it and the &#x27;&#x27;gold&#x27;&#x27; handle rivets are rusted but im on the coast and really humid</li>
    <li> For the money, you absolutely cannot beat this product.  I see some fixed blade straight razors out there that are hundreds of dollars.  This obviously is not that high end.  However, it gives me the closest shave I have ever gotten.  It fits nicely in my hand.  The best part is, with the changeable blades, it never needs sharpened or stropped.  Highly recommend.  In fact, this is the razor my barber uses.</li>
    <li> Best straight razor that I ever used. I own 4 different ones. This one heavier than my other razors but thats a good thing. It takes time to put a blade on, but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> I have the Master and the Black Dragon and I love these razors.  The heavy weight is perfect.  I have been using a straight razor for 9 years and I haven&#x27;t found any thing better.  The derby blades sold by MD Barber Supply are also excellent. For the money I don&#x27;t believe you can get a better razor.  I also have a very expensive Feather Razor and it&#x27;s excellent but costs over $100.  If I had found these razors first I would never have bought the expensive Feather.</li>
    <li> I am a novice, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare against.  I wish there was a little more blade exposure, but for a beginner, this may be for the better.  For the price, I would recommend this to start with.  As I get more comfortable with straight razor shaving, I will upgrade, but I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use when I travel so I don&#x27;t have to take a razor &amp; strop.  This is perfect for that.  Sturdy scales and holds the blade solidly.  Great product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> blade does not fit properly good for shaving neck and sideburns only it will cut up your face good no blades were sent</li>
    <li> this razor gots a good feel to it. i would like the blad to b more exposed. The weight balance makes it feel perfect in control.  i would get another if ne thing..</li>
    <li> is good for the price.  it would have be better if it was a bit heavier. but I does what it suppose to do .</li>
    <li> Made of plastic which felt cheap. No blades to start with, which others in this price point give you. Over all a good way to see if you like this shaving system but could be cheaper given the blade situation.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor, and will be ordering more MD Barber products (this was my first - I am a straight-razor user, not a barber).  The blade-holder leaves are well-finished, of what appears to be a very high-quality stainless steel, and the scales are also nicely finished.  The scales are plastic, with what appears to be brass end-caps at the end.  The razor is nicely balanced.  I am very pleased.  I found this razor to be of far higher build-quality than that of a recently-purchased (and quickly returned) P***er brand razor.</li>
    <li> Shipped in 3 days, seems to be great quality. Does not look or feel cheap, has a good weight and easy to install blades. Im not a razor expert, but I do collect high end knives so I know cheap when I see it. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Overall. I would definitely recommend the razor, you can&#x27;t beat it for the price. If you are looking for the most bang for your Buck, this is it!!</li>
    <li> best razor everrrrrr!!!</li>
    <li> As a barber I&#x27;m always curious about different tools.  I read a few of the other reviews and decided to give it a try. I ordered on Tuesday and picked it up from the post office the next day(awesome).  Loading a blade was a little more tricky than the Mr. C razor I&#x27;m used to, the blades are a lot thinner too, and since the Dragon is stainless steel, I think it&#x27;ll hold up better and not corrode being dipped in and out of barbercide between clients.  Hair shaved off the nape of the neck like butter and I can&#x27;t wait to do a face shave and head shave.  Overall I&#x27;m extremely satisfied</li>
    <li> Holds the blade very well. A bit heavy in the front but that makes the blade slides smoothly on your skin with minimal effort so you avoid cutting yourself. The handle looks cheap but come on the razor it self is actually cheap,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good product.</li>
