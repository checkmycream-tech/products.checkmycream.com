      <li>The package states to not use more than 3 weeks of the month.  </li>
      <li>My mood swings are better.  </li>
      <li>I have also tried progesterone and Dhea in separate creams but use both regularly so more convenient to use in one cream.</li>
      <li>have read many sources citing to use hormonal creams since hormones taken orally</li>

      <li>I love this product and use it twice a day.  </li>
      <li>I love the packaging, and the metered dose pump, but I&#x27;ll not be purchasing this brand again.  </li>
      <li>But so far, so good!</li>
      <li>I find this to be a great balancing cream and would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>OK, this is the ABSOLUTE BEST for naturally dealing with Menopause symptoms and it balances out estrogen.</li>
      <li>I have tried some other brands and I like this one the best.</li>
      <li>This is easy to administer.</li>
      <li>I am a retired teacher and have bones as strong as a 20 year-old according to bone density tests.  </li>
      <li>This helps amazingly with menopause issues of hot flashes and bloating.</li>
      <li>I was too busy looking at all the great reviews and good ingredients and just happened to overlook the last ingredient.  </li>
      <li>There is some great information on all these topics on the web, especially in the Life Extension Foundation articles published 2004-2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know of many useful products that can say that.</li>
      <li>Great product for menopausal symptoms -- especially when combined with it&#x27;s sister product BiEstro-Care, which contains bio-identical USP Estriol and Estradiol.  </li>
      <li>There is some great information on all these topics on the web, especially in the Life Extension Foundation articles published 2004-2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell I was using anything with this particular brand.  </li>
      <li>However, magnesium aluminum silicate is most definitely NOT a &amp;#34;known neurotoxin.&amp;#34; It has been thoroughly tested over many years, in many studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>although I wanted to like this one better, I simply felt like it did not control my symptoms as effectively.  </li>
      <li>I was having more hot flashes and overall was not feeling good at all.</li>
      <li>I really felt energy , and looked better and better mood - I am not to tell you about hot flashes</li>
      <li>but when I only use that amount it seems to be good.</li>
      <li>She wants more it seams to do the trick.</li>
      <li>Wish this would have worked for me though, such a good idea</li>
      <li>I believe it will take another month to see the full benefits/effects of this product.</li>
      <li>Seller was quick.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and it absorbs well and quickly.</li>
      <li>It also had kept me hot flash free.</li>
      <li>I use this on a regular basis, I love this brand, wouldn&#x27;t change!</li>
      <li>someone wants to avoid everything, out of an abundance of caution, fine.</li>
      <li>Dr. White said the saliva test is more accurate than a blood test.  </li>
      <li>No artificial hormones for me.</li>
      <li>I have slept better, felt more alert mentally, lost weight</li>
      <li>It does not leave an oily residue and is quickly absorbed.  </li>
      <li>but this time more natural</li>
      <li>Convenient and reasonable price .User friendly with pump for dose</li>
      <li>It makes me feel better and keeps my skin looking years younger than its true age.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy to see this product on Amazon for about half the price I was paying at my local health food store.  </li>
      <li>There are many reasons why many women and even some men should use natural progesterone creams to help balance hormonal disruptions, but always under the guidance of qualified medical, healthcare or wellness</li>
      <li>My husband is ready to back the semi up to our front door and unload a pallet of this stuff for me to use because it has been so effective for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in menopause, but I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones who has never had much problem with hot flashes, etc.</li>
      <li>Because I have other medical conditions such a PCOS it was great to have my period start on its own without having to use prescription medication.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making a pre-measured pump!  </li>
      <li>have recommended this to several friends who are going through menopause, and they all love it too......</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t give up in the first week of usage.</li>
      <li>Without taking the amount despensed, I have hot flushes.</li>
      <li>Works for my comfort in keeping hot surges throughout the day and night.  </li>
      <li>#34;estrogen dominance?!&amp;#34;) Estrogen continues to be produced from the fat in cells even after menopause; however, progesterone production virtually ends.</li>
      <li>On the recommendation of a lovely lady at my local health food store, I started using this product, and lo, and behold!  </li>
      <li>My sister is now suffering from hot flashes</li>
      <li>This product has done exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
      <li>It really helps with the decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I prefer the one with only progesterone in it.</li>
    <li> The product works great for me and arrived in a very timely manner</li>
    <li> I have had good success with this product.  I use a half pump during the day and a half pump at night.  If I wake up during the night I use a half pump more.  I find that it helps with the jitters, waking up hot at 3 a.m. and restless sleep.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without it...or else, it&#x27;s hormone hell!!</li>
    <li> I have a schedule with this, estrogen, a cortisol regulator, melatonin and barley grass that has put humpty dumpty back together for me.... My husband is ready to back the semi up to our front door and unload a pallet of this stuff for me to use because it has been so effective for me. If I use progesterone without dhea then I take it in pill form along with the progesterone.</li>
    <li> It worked just like it said it was. She wants more it seams to do the trick. I love what it does.</li>
    <li> used femgest which is discontinued, looking for a replacement. this product appears to have all i needed but didn&#x27;t control minor hot flashes which femgest did. on to my next product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do without this for hot-flashes.</li>
    <li> Stinks BAD,, but it works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and I think it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a month now. I have had NO hot flashes or night sweats. I am sleeping better than I have in years too! No known side effects for me other than feeling much better! I am so thankful I found this product.</li>
    <li> container sometimes do not work.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for me.  Had to go on prescription bio-identical hormones.</li>
    <li> I have only been using about a month.  My mood swings are better.  I believe it will take another month to see the full benefits/effects of this product. But so far, so good!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how this product has changed my life.  I started using it before menopause, for PMS symptoms that were severe.  I felt enraged about 1 week out of each month, and was foggy headed, clumsy, very curt and short with people, and not at all pleasant to be around,  On the recommendation of a lovely lady at my local health food store, I started using this product, and lo, and behold!  The raging beast was tamed!  It even helped with menstrual cramps.  Then when I entered menopause, I stopped using it, thinking it was not necessary.  WRONG!!  After a few months, I has such terrible night sweats and hot flashes, I felt as if I would spontaneously burst into flames.  I had a little Progesta Care left over, so I tried it, and within a few days, all was calm again.  I use it for 3 weeks, then lay off for one week per month.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to several friends who are going through menopause, and they all love it too......</li>
    <li> Aluminum is a known neurotoxin. However, magnesium aluminum silicate is most definitely NOT a &amp;#34;known neurotoxin.&amp;#34; It has been thoroughly tested over many years, in many studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone wants to avoid everything, out of an abundance of caution, fine. For example, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not putting hormones in my body!!! Who knows what will happen? It might cause cancer!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know lots of women who have used this product. It works great, and none have reported side effects. I don&#x27;t know of many useful products that can say that.</li>
    <li> I really like the formulation on this &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34; Life-Flo product.  I have switched over from the progesterone only form because of the addition of pregnenolone and 7-Keto DHEA in this one.  I think the additional ingredients improve and already good product.&lt;br /&gt;It still has the same excellent cream base and handy measured, pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> OK, this is the ABSOLUTE BEST for naturally dealing with Menopause symptoms and it balances out estrogen. I have slept better, felt more alert mentally, lost weight and my night sweats are gone. I don&#x27;t even take my supplement when I am on this. It is pre-measured when you squeeze the pump. Use this instead of taking pills. It absorbs better!</li>
    <li> I see an improvement in my mood, tolerance, etc with the use of this and bi-estro care. I would recommend if you are slightly deficient and need a little boost.</li>
    <li> Great product..have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in menopause, but I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones who has never had much problem with hot flashes, etc. I was on prescription bio-identical hormones off and on over the years, could never tell a difference one way or the other, but now I&#x27;ve decided that I don&#x27;t need all that, and I&#x27;d like to find an OTC progesterone cream to use. I haven&#x27;t noticed any effects, pro or con, but the smell is like something rancid and outdated, even though the date stamped on it says otherwise. The scent in any body product is about 50% of its value to me. I&#x27;ve been putting a drop of Essential Oil in with it to camouflage the odor and will likely use the rest of the bottle, but this is a one-time purchase.</li>
    <li> It made me feel really hyper and edgy. Thinking that it was the additional DHEA and Pregnelonone that affected me that way. As soon as the product ran out, I began to return to my normal self. I now understand what it must feel like to have ADHD. I will try their plain progesterone cream sometime. I like their Estriol. It seems to be helping me a lot along with my NOW formula progesterone cream and NOW menopause supplements.</li>
    <li> For me .... it gives me more energy.&lt;br /&gt;I am not so very tired &amp; very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;I use less than what they tell you to.&lt;br /&gt;That is what works for me.&lt;br /&gt;We are all very different, so you will have to judge for yourself.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see this product on Amazon for about half the price I was paying at my local health food store.  Way to go Amazon!  I find this to be a great balancing cream and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 5 years and recently added the Bio-Estro from Life-Flo which increased my results.  Night and day sweats gone.  Tried Amberen last year and it was only about 50 percent effective.  So i went back to Life-Flo.  The cost is so low and it sure beats paying doctor&#x27;s bills and being on prescription drugs.  Like all things, you have to give it about 4 to 8 weeks of usage to experience results so don&#x27;t give up in the first week of usage.</li>
    <li> Before I went on doctor prescribed hormones I used the creams. I&#x27;d say they work okay but if you are really suffering from menopause, get the doctors prescribed hormones. They do a better job at the 33 symptoms of menopause!</li>
    <li> I wish I had started this a few years ago! I think every woman needs to start in their forties. I&#x27;m 50 now and have been using this for 3 years. Have tried other bra ds and go back to this. Convenient and reasonable price .User friendly with pump for dose I have also tried progesterone and Dhea in separate creams but use both regularly so more convenient to use in one cream. I had great luck for 2 years for many menopausal symptoms but needed to start estrogen this year!</li>
    <li> I had been on prescription HRT for several years, tried tapering down and my hot flashes ect. would come back. I started using Progesta-care complete and Biestro-Care, I have stopped taking the oral HRT and no hot flashes. It&#x27;s also helped with other menopausal symptoms such as dryness. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Wow this product really works well for me! No more hot flashes! My sister is now suffering from hot flashes and I recommended it to her!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand when I found it had a metered dose pump, and a slightly lower price than my regular brand of progesterone cream, but I noticed a difference as soon as I began using it (as compared to my regular brand).  The difference was impossible to ignore, although I wanted to like this one better, I simply felt like it did not control my symptoms as effectively.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell I was using anything with this particular brand.  I am a believer in the benefit of topical progesterone therapy, and I&#x27;m not certain why this brand was less effective, but it certainly was for me.  I love the packaging, and the metered dose pump, but I&#x27;ll not be purchasing this brand again.  Too bad I ordered two bottles of it, and I waited a week past the return deadline or I&#x27;d be sending it back.</li>
    <li> I have been using natural Progesterone creams for nearly 20 years.  This is one of the best and is the most economical to use.  I am a retired teacher and have bones as strong as a 20 year-old according to bone density tests.  The pump is a handy way to measure out the amount that you want to use and the consistency is like a cream, not a lotion.  No artificial hormones for me.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT* REASONABLE PRICE*I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN FROM AMAZON</li>
    <li> Use this product daily; however, I&#x27;m not sure if its helping with my heat flashes as they seem to have increased.</li>
    <li> I use this.  I&#x27;m happy with the dispensing pump - never had any problems with it.  Seller was quick.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It really seems to work for me. I had a total hysterectomy and use this to replace some hormones naturally. I appreciated the hint that if you apply it at night it will help you sleep too!</li>
    <li> my doctor guessed I used this because i had no symptoms of menopause, I also lost 10 lbs</li>
    <li> I use this on a regular basis, I love this brand, wouldn&#x27;t change!</li>
    <li> Along with a healthy lifestyle this will work well.  I&#x27;v  given up meat, most dairy,  exercise and walk.&lt;br /&gt;Used in conjunction with supplements you will feel good.  You can&#x27;t do just this, eat junk, be a couch&lt;br /&gt;potato and expect miracles.</li>
    <li> Thanks for making a pre-measured pump!  This product is wonderful and it has made a difference.  I noticed a huge difference when I ran out, that will not happen again!</li>
    <li> Tho is the best medication for Brest tumor</li>
    <li> Works for my comfort in keeping hot surges throughout the day and night.  Without taking the amount despensed, I have hot flushes.</li>
    <li> This helps amazingly with menopause issues of hot flashes and bloating. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used ProgestaCare Complete for two months and it did not get rid of the hot flashes but worked well for vaginal dryness and has made my skin softer.  But my main problem was my hot flashes so I decided to try the BiestorCare also made by Life-Flo.  That did it,  my hot flashes have decreased in intensity and in numbers greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women in menopause need the Estrogen,  and the Progesterone to help balance the Estrogen.  Since Progesterone is one of the first hormones women loose,  I would assume taking this product alone would work well for perimenopause and premenopause.  But when we are smack dab in menopause and postmenopause we must have the estrogen.</li>
    <li> I am referring to the product. I formerly used a product that had to be scooped out daily with a spoon. Big pain. This is easy to administer. I just wish it rubbed in better, that&#x27;s my only criticism.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, doesn&#x27;t have a rank aroma, and brings the pms to an end. Very grateful to have found this, as the perimenopause makes the hormone fairy skip our house every so often.  One squirt does the trick, for 7 days, twice a day. Afterwards, like the time we endure does its monthly visit, and ta da. No more crazies.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised at how quickly this product worked. I have been using it for about two weeks now. I immediately used it morning and eve. I was not using any HRT at the time, but seriously need to.  I had surgical menopause 10 years ago at age 40 due to endometriosis. Very painful!! , so the only solution per my OBGYN was to have a complete hysterectomy including ovaries.  I had immediate hot flashes in waves the day after the surgery so he prescribed ESTRIDIOL  (estrogen- plant based- NOT synthetic) . Worked very well and took for about 5 years, but noticed after awhile I was looking bloated and puffy.. and realized after researching  I was not taking any other hormone therapy to balance the estrogen out.  So I weened myself off the Dr. prescribed estrogen and went cold Turkey taking nothing.. I don&#x27;t know why. But my girlfriend had talked me into it. After about a year I felt horrible. Depressed gained a terrible amount of weight, and had to take a drug like Stratterra and Adderral to keep my mood up.  I finally had enough and decided it was time to find some HRT but this time more natural and I came across this product.  I ordered this plus the Life-Flo BIESTRO-CARE (that has both kids of estrogen in it). And wow!! I can not even tell how different I feel. I do not have to take any Adderrall anymore. I feel like I did before my surgery.  I would recommend having your hormones tested by a BIO IDENTICAL Dr. which I was getting ready to do. but gave this a try first. and it just so happened to work. I would curious to see what my HRT read out would say...but for now I am satisfied and my vaginal dryness is getting better each day..too! I would highly recommend this product!! ;)</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  It is very Outstanding!  It is also priced very affordable.  Thanks you so very much.</li>
    <li> I had been using Life-Flo Progesta-Care Plus Natural Progesterone Body Cream with Phytoestrogens and when I placed a reorder, I purchased this one by accident.  This particular formulation did not work as well I my previous purchase.  I was having more hot flashes and overall was not feeling good at all.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the pump cream. Wish it would have worked on me. When my expensive Rx for oral DHEA ran out, I thought this would be a good option as a replacement. However, I didn&#x27;t have any luck with the results. Perhaps because it&#x27;s a blend? Not sure, but since I didn&#x27;t have results, I ordered some oral OTC DHEA and have had good results. Wish this would have worked for me though, such a good idea and I&#x27;d like not to have to take more pills.</li>
    <li> Has helped with night sweats and mood.  The only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little heavy.  Wish it were a serum.</li>
    <li> Hi.  It does have a faint weird smell when you first put it on, but it fades very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with lack of menstrual cycle. So I ordered this product in hopes that it would help with my low progesterone levels. This product has done exactly what I needed it to do. My period started after years of not having a period I had no side effects. Because I have other medical conditions such a PCOS it was great to have my period start on its own without having to use prescription medication.</li>
    <li> I am going through menopause. and was loseing my mind. fife flo made me fill Human again. it has been the best thing a women can use during this time of her life.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it twice a day.  It makes me feel better and keeps my skin looking years younger than its true age.  I use it on my face and neck teice a day and my skin feels firm, soft and hydrated.  It looks line-free and radiant. It does not leave an oily residue and is quickly absorbed.  It also had kept me hot flash free.</li>
    <li> Never used this brand before but have really appreciated the measured pumps. It helped reduce and/or resolve my symptoms within a few days (hot flashes, depression, anxiety and low energy).  Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using Life flo Progesterone alone for several months, and am now trying this one with DHEA. I can only use a dot of about 1/2 the dosage or my mood becomes not very pleasant...but when I only use that amount it seems to be good.</li>
    <li> I really felt energy , and looked better and better mood - I am not to tell you about hot flashes -I am 43 and dont have them yet - but generally -I totally love the product and already bought the second bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product for menopausal symptoms -- especially when combined with it&#x27;s sister product BiEstro-Care, which contains bio-identical USP Estriol and Estradiol.  (They are NOT phytoestrogens).  If this progesterone does not work for you, it is probably because you are at the point where you now need to combine it with the estrogens, in which case I highly recommend Life Flo BiEstro-Care.  Progesterone typically works very well for peri-menopause, as it did for me, but by the time a person has full blown menopausal symptoms they need the estrogens also.  Of course, you can always have a doctor do a blood test to measure your hormone levels, but for some people like me, the test will show you are in the normal range when you are having symptoms from hell.  Suffice it to say that &#x27;normal&#x27; ranges are not &#x27;normal&#x27; for everyone.  Just remember, whenever you use Estrogens it must be combined with progesterone.  There is tons of info about bio-identical hormones on the internet, but this is a good bio-identical progesterone cream.</li>
    <li> There are many reasons why many women and even some men should use natural progesterone creams to help balance hormonal disruptions, but always under the guidance of qualified medical, healthcare or wellness professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read many sources citing to use hormonal creams since hormones taken orally tend to be 90% eliminated by the liver before being utilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural progesterone USP is linked to many health benefits including: helping the body to eliminate excess sodium and fluids thereby acting as a natural diuretic (obviously safer than our experience with Lasix!),  raises core body temperature (thermogenesis- much safer method than using germanium!) which translates to increased fat burning by helping the thyroid, it helps with bone building (preventing osteoporosis), helps to regulate blood sugars (stabilizes both highs and lows which is critical for both the diabetic and those who are hypoglycemic, and it helps to regulate blood pressure; in other words, progesterone plays a key role in ALL chronic metabolic conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pregnenolone was very well studied in the 1940s through 1970s and was highly recognized for it&#x27;s anti-inflammatory effects on the body and was used extensively for this health property until corticosteroids were developed by pharmaceutical companies (ie for greedy profits over real health.) Pregnenolone is the grandmother of *all* hormones. Every hormone in the body originally started out as pregnenolone - obviously a shortage or deficiency here translates into deficiencies elsewhere in the body&#x27;s proper functioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-keto-DHEA is very well known for it&#x27;s weight loss benefits. DHEA is also proven to help build bones, strengthen the heart, help promote energy and cognitive function- all good benefits to help smooth the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package indicates to massage into the chest, abdomen, inner thighs and upper arms, rotating each once or twice daily application. I have come across many other reports of other ways to apply this cream including closer to the pubic areas and avoiding areas closer to the liver.  There are a number of articles and sources citing the application of this cream directly onto the male and female genitalia for treating specific issues - again, follow the advice of your provider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the package:  each full press of the pump provides approximately 20 mg of natural progesterone USP, 15 mg of pregnenolone, and 15 mg of 7-keto-DHEA acetate.  Since it is formulated as 480 mg of progesterone per ounce, this equates to 24 presses per ounce or approximately 96 for this 4 ounce bottle. The package states to not use more than 3 weeks of the month.  There is much research and theory around this statement... follow the advice of your healthcare &amp; wellness professionals as well as *listen to your body*.  There is some great information on all these topics on the web, especially in the Life Extension Foundation articles published 2004-2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As when starting any new supplement, always follow the guidance of your trusted healthcare provider and start with BABY STEPS as your body adjusts to changes.many other reports of other ways to apply this cream including closer to the pubic areas and avoiding areas closer to the liver.

    <li> I was too busy looking at all the great reviews and good ingredients and just happened to overlook the last ingredient.  Magnesium aluminum silicate is a known neurotoxin.  Most places will tell you that the molecules are too big to absorb but that&#x27;s not enough reason to risk it.  It&#x27;s not something you should want on your skin even if it doesn&#x27;t absorb.  Aluminum in any form is very harmful to the body.  I definitely do not want this on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried some other brands and I like this one the best. The automatic dispenser is great. You don&#x27;t have to guess at the amount, and you always get the same dose. This product really helped with night sweats and insomnia in (post) menopause. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it absorbs well and quickly. If there is a scent, I haven&#x27;t noticed it. I have used it for about 9 months. I have it on subscribe and save so I don&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People will tell you that you don&#x27;t need progesterone if you&#x27;ve had a hysterectomy and no longer have a uterus, but I think that&#x27;s bunk! My uterus isn&#x27;t the ONLY part of my body that utilized progesterone. I have an estrogen patch and I actually get more relief with this product. Some of the signs of low progesterone are depression, low thyroid, fibrocystic issues, water retention, weight gain, and loss of libido. During the menopausal years, progesterone levels decrease to almost zero while estrogen levels only decrease by 40 to 60 per cent (can you say &amp;#34;estrogen dominance?!&amp;#34;) Estrogen continues to be produced from the fat in cells even after menopause; however, progesterone production virtually ends. Some practitioners say that women over 50 years of age should use natural progesterone cream to prevent osteoporosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the improvements I have seen while using this regularly have been a reduction in muscle aches and pains, improvement of skin issues, and improved sleep patterns. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;*personal purchase</li>
    <li> I love this product because Itaddresses all my mid life issues post menopause.I sleep better and am in better frame of mind no snapping everyone heads off and no horrible mood swings. It should be used by every woman who is having hormone issues.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for me as a woman that is 67 yrs old and still in menopause.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, couldn&#x27;t go without it!</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t be without it - - takes the edge off - ah</li>
    <li> I have been using progesterone cream for years, as I am post-menopausal.  It keeps away the hot flashes, and I believe (as Dr. John Lee stated in a lecture of his) that it helps make small skin cancers go away.  Try it, you may agree...</li>
    <li> I have been using progesterone products for many years and have found Life-Flo Progesta-care Complete to be one of the best on the market!</li>
    <li> The main reason I purchased my first container of \\&quot;Progestra Care Complete\\&quot; in Sept. 2012 was due to EXTREME vaginal dryness. I am post menopause so I have been using 2 pumps a day for the last 4 1/2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose two pumps each day after reading, \\&quot;WHAT YOUR DOCTOR MAY NOT TELL YOU ABOUT MENOPAUSE,\\&quot; by Dr. John Lee.  Website is: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He suggested to some of his post menopausal patients to take the equivalent of two pumps a day for 4-6 months.  He stressed the importance, then, to get a test done to see where their hormone level was at, after using the cream twice a day for that amount of time. (The kit may be ordered from his website, or if you type \\&quot;hormone test kit\\&quot; into search engine, you will find other places available.  Dr. White said the saliva test is more accurate than a blood test.  I PLAN TO DO BOTH, HOWEVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product I did not have mood swings or hot flashes so I cannot speak to these issues.  I did have SLEEPLESSNESS issues but cannot say it has helped with that. But for VAGINAL DRYNESS, IT HAS HELPED! Every other day, I use a pump (one of the two per day) on my face and neck.  It has helped with softening my skin, somewhat...causing lines above my upper lips to look less severe. But this is not a face cream, it is a HORMONE CREAM, so we need to be careful to not use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer, which read like a professional, company spokesperson mentioned a 4 oz bottle had 96 pumps. I have found this to be pretty much correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting using this product I have found a female doctor, locally, whose specialty is, \\&quot;Menopause\\&quot;.  I plan to go see her and tell her all I have been doing and be under her guidance.  I am not a doctor!  I understand the importance of being under their care, especially during such a transitory time in a woman&#x27;s life.  I hope my review has helped you in some way.  I am coming to understand the importance of reading all the reviews one can before purchasing a product.  It really helps with the decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!  I ordered this product in early October from DAKOTA DEEDS.&lt;br /&gt;The pump was defective.  I returned product.  Am being penalized for sending back a defective product.  I paid almost $28 (including shipping) and am being&lt;br /&gt;refunded just $19.98.  Beware before ordering from this company.ng a product.

    <li> I am undecided about this product. I feel it left me fatigued. I am not quite sure why. I&#x27;ve read other reviewers and they stated it gave them energy. I will use it a bit longer to see if there is any difference.</li>
