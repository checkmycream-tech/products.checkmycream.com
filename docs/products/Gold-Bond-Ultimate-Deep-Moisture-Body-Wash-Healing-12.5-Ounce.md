      <li>I have been using this wash for a about a week and have noticed my skin is soft, smooth radiant all day</li>
      <li>If you have ever seen what the hot sun does to a sweet, soft, moist, and</li>
      <li>It lasts MUCH longer than other body washes and makes my skin nice.  </li>
      <li>Will continue top purchase as needed as long as I can get it.....</li>
      <li>My skin was so dry and rough, now it&#x27;s baby soft from using the Gold Bond Ultimate Deep Moisture Body Wash. Great product, great price.</li>

      <li>She really likes this product, I will probably set her up a scheduled monthly delivery.</li>
      <li>I have very dry/irritated skin, and this body wash works very well for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with really dry rough crack (sometimes bleed ) skin at the knees ( could have been from break dancing back in the days lol ). I was embarrassed to put on my shorts afraid people would call me ashy Larry, so I gave this a try. 1st application smoothed 80% of my dry skin and a 2nd coat made the cracks vanish. even after washing my hands or legs the lotion can still be felt. it last all day so no need to carry the bottle with you. very excellent product and would sure purchase another pack when needed.</li>
    <li> It Is perfect for my combination body. I love how  it feels and smells on me. I will highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond is great. I have skin issues and this product always, always relieves my issues. So glad I can order it here.</li>
    <li> I actually initially bought this product on accident thinking it was their lotion that I also absolutely love. Today I went to the store to restock for myself as well as send to my husband overseas and the store had discontinued it, so here I am ordering it from amazon. I gave a bottle of this to my mother-in-law whose skin is so sensitive that up until I gave her this she wasn&#x27;t able to even use soap. By far the best body wash I have ever used, even above dove and Olay body washes which was what I had used before- and this although is somewhat scented is not anything like dove or Olay in the way that it won&#x27;t alter the smell of any perfume or lotion you wear. It helps that you really don&#x27;t need lotion after using this too.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have found so far!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best body washes I ever used. After days of using it I could really tell a difference. But as quickly as it worked it dropped off the shelves so amazon i the only place I can find it now.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and also chronic hives.  I ran out of this soap, used something else and my hives returned.  I cannot locate this in any store any longer, but can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash.  It is expensive, but really keeps your sky from getting dry.  I love the gold bond lotion as well. Even though it is expensive for the size I will continue to buy.  It lasts MUCH longer than other body washes and makes my skin nice.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my 73 yr old mom, It had been recommended to her by a family member for her dry skin. We searched all of the local store, and could not find it, so luckily I found it on Amazon. She really likes this product, I will probably set her up a scheduled monthly delivery.</li>
    <li> Is the best body wash I have found  for my body.  It has a nice lather and keeps my skin soft.  I love it.</li>
    <li> If you have psoriasis, you may want to give this body wash a try.  It has helped me more than some prescription creams.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this body wash. it&#x27;s simply amazing and leave the skin super soft. Why is it that all good products get discontinued?? I haven&#x27;t been able to find this ANYWHERE. Last time i purchased it which was less than a year ago it was $8 and now it&#x27;s $20. I&#x27;m sad. I can&#x27;t justify that for a body wash.</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash I have found. Love love love it. It has helped my dry itchy skin greatly.</li>
    <li> I loved this body wash and the comfort powders with aloe. I used to buy the at walmart store in Anderson, SC. they discontinued them both from their shelves. both of these products were great. I have psoriasis and these products really helped. they were reasonably priced. where can these products be found now? I have prescriptions for creams for psoriasis that cost $420.00 for one of them and $380. for the other one. I cannot afford these prices, so these prescriptions are still at the drug-store and will stay there forever. I would rate these products a 10star.&lt;br /&gt;Patricia Cox</li>
    <li> This body wash works just fine for me, makes enough suds and yet is not harsh on the skin. I reccoment it</li>
    <li> My sisters and I started using this product a year as our body wash. All of us have noticed how much softer our skin is.  Will never go back to regular bar soap as long as it is made.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years.  It is not a cure all, but it definitely improves the feel of my skin, and I have very old skin.</li>
    <li> This product makes your skin so smooth, you won&#x27;t need to put moistriize on after your shower..  It really does work.</li>
    <li> Love this healing and soothing as well as moisturizing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. One tube arrived broken.</li>
    <li> I have very paper thin skin that breaks out in lesions all year long. this is the ONLY body soap that does not give me any skin problems, and it moisturizes too!!</li>
    <li> Sooooo disappointed that this product has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  It was the BEST shower cleanser.  Sooooo creamy and mositurizing.  I used it in place of shave gel and I used it daily on my upper arms for KP.  It did not clear the redness but did improve the texture of my KP.  The problem was that it was never properly marketed.  It was almost impossible to find in stores as it was not stocked with the bath products but with all the other Gold Bond products.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon, but I will have to renew the search again for something that works this well.</li>
    <li> I find this body wash soothing and healing as the tube suggests.  It is great for itchy and dry skin.  Sorry the makers decided to discontinue the product.</li>
    <li> Wow a little goes such a long way. Its so important to moisturize your skin  hard water, soap, sun, and being diabetic all take a toll on your skin. This body wash leaves your skin like u just added lotion. its not greasy feeling, and rinses off nice. I use about half of this compared to other body washes.</li>
    <li> Makes our skin very smooth and soft. Pleasant fragrance too. What more can I say? Easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> This bodywash moisturizes without leaving an icky, oily residue.  Also, doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I always use it before/after shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> This is really the best I ever had in body wash, I strongly recommend this product. Your skin improves noticeable by the time and even more after three days of use it worked for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  My 83 year-old mother loves as well as my 16 year-old son.  They both have dry skin and feel itchy at times.  This helps make the skin look and feel so much better.  Wonderful wonderful product!</li>
    <li> It was what I wanted and it works as it specifies. Products is great and both my husband &amp; I both use it!!</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use many body washes. The Gold Bond Healing (and also their Softening!) Body Wash is perfect.  Not too highly scented, they have a light and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find a body wash that didn&#x27;t make my skin dry and itchy but Gold Bond&#x27;s products actually make my skin softer, smoother and moisturized. They create lots of lather with a small amount of body wash. I love Gold Bond products. I highly recommend their moisturizing foot cream too!</li>
    <li> This product is way too expensive for the amount of body wash in the container.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. This is what she says: \\&quot;The Best Product\\&quot; I have found that actually works. Softens your skin, smells great and you only use a little. My skin was so dry and rough, now it&#x27;s baby soft from using the Gold Bond Ultimate Deep Moisture Body Wash. Great product, great price. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  When you get out of the shower your skin feels soft. I even use it to wash my face and it doesn&#x27;t make it feel greasy.</li>
    <li> The Gold Bond Ultimate Deep Moisture Body Wash is one of the best products I have ever used.  I fondly refer to my skin as \\&quot;alligator\\&quot; skin and I can tell you no alligator ever felt this soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is quite dense and lathers up best with a sponge.  If you squeeze a bit more than a quarter size of the product on a wet sponge it will more than wash your entire body with plenty of suds left over.  There is absolutely no residue or itching and I have actually been able to use the product without having to lotion my body afterward if I am in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and there is not scent.  I was even able to get my husband and my father to try it and they liked it as well even using a sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very competitive and if you shop around you can find a deal once in a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions and Gold Bond is the only lotion that healed my extremely dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried out all of the Gold Bond lotions and they all have worked for me. I can&#x27;t say anything bad about them. They smell great, they&#x27;re not greasy and the best part is that the moisture lasts for 24 hours. This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> This has been difficult to find anymore in stores:/ it is the only body wash I can use to shave my legs that doesn&#x27;t cause razor burn! I wish they still sold it in stores so I didn&#x27;t have to pay $25 to order:( but the product is great!</li>
    <li> I have loved this product since I first used it.  I can definitely tell that my skin feels softer after using it</li>
    <li> This has been very good for irritations.  Have had problems with skin irritations for quite a while and this has healed the problem</li>
    <li> Have re-ordered it twice for my exceedingly dry skin.</li>
    <li> Amazon....your myskins  hero for having this product available!  Have used this great product for about two years.  Solved all my dry skin issues and then it was no longer avaiable at my local store.  Will continue top purchase as needed as long as I can get it.....the product works GREAT for me.</li>
    <li> I have very dry/irritated skin, and this body wash works very well for me. Other products claiming to be for dry skin and have a &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; label have never seemed to make the cut. This body wash almost makes you feel like you have used a moisturizer or lotion. It is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is  great product!  For some reason it has been difficult to find in the local stores--so I was thrilled to find it</li>
    <li> On 07/31/2013 I bought 5 tubes for 5.99 a tube (12.5 oz - 48 cents per ounce).&lt;br /&gt;The only ones I have been able to find on AMAZON the last few days are 22.00 a tube (12.5 oz - 1.76 per oz).&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t pay 3.52 a day (I use about 2 oz per day) for body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to make my own with Kroger body wash and mix in baby oil and aloe vera and see how that goes</li>
    <li> I bought [[ASIN:B004IS92G8 Gold Bond Ultimate Deep Moisture Body Wash, Healing, 12.5-Ounce]] on a whim.  I didn&#x27;t so much need another wash inasmuch as I was bored with the one I was using.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it, too.  I&#x27;ve never used a wash before that left my skin so wonderfully soft and scented.  It&#x27;s so nice that it&#x27;s going on my Subscribe and Save list.  My skin isn&#x27;t dried-out at all and feels lovely.</li>
    <li> It is a great product and I really like it for my shower.  No better product out there for me.</li>
    <li> Good price and great ship time. Received it right away. Just what the misses wanted. She purchased enough to share some and have a good supply on hand.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a skin problem and it has helped to control the&lt;br /&gt;Spread an itching. Thanks !</li>
    <li> this is the very best body wash on the market!  It is the only one that really moisturizes my skin without felling &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; or oily afterwards.  It is very difficult to find, but luckily Amazon had it!</li>
    <li> Good product. But it came with a hole in the top which meant I had to either toss it or transfer it into another bottle. I choose option #2 and lost a lot of the product in the process.</li>
    <li> Utah in the winter.  If you have lived here you understand that it is very dry even though we have six plus inches of snow in the yard, the air is so dry.  The air sucks moisture out of your body.  If you have ever seen what the hot sun does to a sweet, soft, moist, and oh so tender rose when it is off of the vine and in the sun, that is what the winter air does to people&#x27;s skin in Utah and this body wash is better than any body wash</li>
    <li> THis body wash is the best product on the market!  We wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Our skin is so soft and moist, and the feeling lasts all day.  The scent is clean and not overwhelming so it won&#x27;t interfere if you want to use fragrance.  But I am constantly told that I smell wonderful, fresh and clean, so I don&#x27;t have to use any fragrance.  This product is a \\&quot;Gold Mine!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> FIVE STAR ----- BUT COST WAY, WAY TO MUCH!</li>

    <li> This is great body wash especially if your skin is feeling the effects of winter.  I am a fan of the Gold Bond Ultimate line and this product did not disappoint.  Very mild scent, lathers and rinses nicely, and very soothing to the skin.</li>
