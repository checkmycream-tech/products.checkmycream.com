      <li>Still, I do makeup for movies and it has come in handy as a prop and as a resource for preparing talent for shoots.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The case the product comes in is a nice, sturdy case with a snap-close and a good-quality mirror.  </li>

      <li>I am glad that I did.</li>
      <li>However I have ordered from shany before, and I have not been satisfied with the packing.</li>
      <li>THE EYESHADOWS ARE SO VELVETY AND SMOOTH!</li>
      <li>I love the colors though.</li>
      <li>And when you put secolors on, they get even more muted...</li>

      <li>Love the colors,which of course are very colorful and pigmented as alway because they are Shany!</li>
      <li>Very exciting colors!</li>
      <li>I loved it the first time I seen it</li>
      <li>the reason why i say it is 99% fab is because while the colors are bright and pigmented, the shimmer in the color really brightens the color.</li>
      <li>the colors are very pigmented and good quality</li>
      <li>Its beautiful, unique, and is velvety soft.</li>
      <li>The plastic doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or brittle, the latch is secure, and the brushes and mirror look fine too (don&#x27;t use brushes myself, but they don&#x27;t feel like the cheap foamy ones that fall apart).</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this palette.</li>
      <li>I tried it anyways, since it was cheap, and I figured to return it</li>
      <li>Soooo smooth and</li>
      <li>So smooth to apply.</li>
      <li>Pigmented, blendable colors and sooooo smooth.</li>
      <li>The plus is that they are shimmery colors that are fairly smooth in application.  </li>

      <li>Take my advice, and invest in it, It&#x27;s worth every penny, you won&#x27;t regret buying it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun to mix up and play up my loook!</li>
      <li>It stays on, the colors are great, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>there very silky and easy to apply!</li>
      <li>I love the whole multi effect thing.</li>
      <li>so they are about 99% true to color.</li>
      <li>and I like having some more unusual colors to work with.</li>
      <li>Arrived quick, well packaged, and in pristine condition.</li>
      <li>The colors are very vivid, go on smoothly and blend easily.</li>
      <li>i love it and highly recommend it.</li>

      <li>super vibrant and easy to apply and can be worked well with water, always a plus.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> got my replacement in the mail because the first one was crazy broken when it arrived. I love the colors though. super vibrant and easy to apply and can be worked well with water, always a plus. still a little bummed though that it&#x27;s not Shany...i don&#x27;t know why they would advertise it as such when it clearly has another brand name written on the outside. oh well! i dig whatever it is</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Its beautiful, unique, and is velvety soft. Ususally when I order eyeshadow, at least one or 2 are broken, this product was perfect. However I have ordered from shany before, and I have not been satisfied with the packing. I was fortunate when I received this!</li>
    <li> i like how the colors are bright and they go on great. it has a big mirror you also carry it in purse if u need too. no damge at all</li>
    <li> I purchased one set at first weary that it would arrive broken or that I wouldn&#x27;t like the colors, and the price was a little steep. Or even that it would be too messy. Boy was I wrong, and super glad that I decided to invest in this palette. The colors are absolutely stunning, soft, and go on so beautifully that you don&#x27;t need more than a little for it to go a long way. What I especially liked was that it was powder, and not the creamy stuff that I hate, that was a bonus add-on. I used it with Urban Decay&#x27;s Eyeshadow primer on Easter, and mixed 4 different colors together. It not only lasted all day, but I got so many compliments from everyone in my family, that even my cousin asked me to do a similar effect on her eyes. Take my advice, and invest in it, It&#x27;s worth every penny, you won&#x27;t regret buying it!</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow went on just like it says...like velvet! It covered well and I didn&#x27;t have to use that much.</li>
    <li> This palette contains highly pigmented, long lasting shadows - the colors are beautiful, yet each pan contains two colors that blend together - almost as one color.  All colors work well, shadow are soft and pretty.  Great mirror in case.   Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I received this item today. The colors are very pretty. My only concern was the box it came in was really tattered and when I opened the makeup one of the eyeshadows fell out. Fortunately, it wasn&#x27;t cracked or broken. All in all I am a fan of the product, just not how the package was handled.</li>
    <li> I plead guilty of not reading the description throughly, and being unpleasantly surprised when my order arrives, so when I read this and it says &#x27;velvet&#x27; touch, to me that means matte not shiny. Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of semantics. Women my age do not look good in glittery shadow, it just accents the fact that your skin is not as taut as it might be. This product is so the opposite of matte, you could probably read by it&#x27;s glow. The colors are kind of shocking as well, so it will collect dust in my makeup drawer I guess. Or I can save it for next Halloween.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow palette is marketed as a Shany product and this is something called Starry, made in China? What the HE!! is this supposed to be and how can you sell a product and not supply what you are selling? I broke 3 of my fingernails trying to open the crap case. It is complete rubbish.  Very sorry I bought this product but you get what you pay for : /</li>
    <li> This pallet has very good quality eyeshadows I loved it the first time I seen it and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS EYESHADOW PALETTE!! I BOUGHT YEARS AGO AND JUST REPURCHASED! THE EYESHADOWS ARE SO VELVETY AND SMOOTH! ALSO EXTREMELY PIGMENTED!!!</li>
    <li> Good color selection, ultra blendable and compact palette.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with Shany eyeshadow.  Love the color payout and quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great little eyeshadow! And the multi-effects are awesome. Like getting 2 colors in one! Very exciting colors! I usually do not like smaller palettes but this one rocks!</li>
    <li> First off, this product is NOT Shany.  It is made by \\&quot;Starry U.S.A.\\&quot; or \\&quot;Starry U.S.A Boutique Colors.\\&quot;  (Interestingly enough, despite having \\&quot;U.S.A.\\&quot; in its name, it is not manufactured in the U.S.A.!  But nothing is anymore, so I can&#x27;t complain too much there...)  In any event, this product is very falsely advertised.  I tried it anyways, since it was cheap, and I figured to return it, I would probably have to pay the return shipping, which would probably cost as much as what I paid for the product anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is unfortunately not anywhere near Shany quality.  In the palette, the colors appear vibrant; however, not anywhere near as vibrant as actual Shany products.  And when you put secolors on, they get even more muted...nowhere near Shany pigmentation.  The plus is that they are shimmery colors that are fairly smooth in application.  However, they are not as smooth as a real Shany eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the green (right column, 3rd from the bottom) and the beige (left column, bottom), and they took more working with than my Shany eyeshadows to get them on.  (With Shany, I put powder on the brush, and I can get from on side of my eyelid to the other with one brush stroke.  Not the case with this product.  I had to re-load much more often with this product than I do with Shany.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is unclear to me why this product is called a 24-color palette.  It contains 12 colors that are marbled with a second color, so maybe that is how they got 24 colors?  However, for many of the colors, their \\&quot;marble\\&quot; is so small, it&#x27;s hardly enough to call it a second color.  For example, the light blue (left column, 2nd from the top), its \\&quot;marble\\&quot; is the size of about 1.5 peas.  The purple directly across from it has a similar \\&quot;marble\\&quot; size.  And in the case of the green, the darker green color cast a turquoise hue on the light green, so the end result was not a nice, spring green as I was hoping for, but rather, a turquoise-y color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case the product comes in is a nice, sturdy case with a snap-close and a good-quality mirror.  (This is the one and only area where I would say this product out-performs Shany!  If you&#x27;ve ordered Shany before, you know.  In my opinion, Shany&#x27;s packaging leaves something to be desired.)  It comes with a small sponge applicator, which I haven&#x27;t tried because I don&#x27;t use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this product is just a disappointing dud.  This is not a Shany product, and it doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the quality nor performance of a Shany product.  Normally, I can work with an eyeshadow palette, and it&#x27;s rare for me to give an eyeshadow 1-star, because I love eyeshadow, but I just don&#x27;t see myself using this at all.</li>
    <li> I just received my order and I could not be happier. Arrived quick, well packaged, and in pristine condition. Quality is clear when you first open it up. The colours are vivid and go on creamy and smooth. Actually wants to stick to your eyelid, not your finger, and smudges just how I want it too. Some have complained about the case being cheap, and I disagree. The plastic doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or brittle, the latch is secure, and the brushes and mirror look fine too (don&#x27;t use brushes myself, but they don&#x27;t feel like the cheap foamy ones that fall apart). The colours look quite matte to me in the photo above, but actually have a fine shimmer. For me, however, this was a pleasant suprise as I feel it makes them look even BETTER and adds a lovely depth of colour. &lt;3 this so much!</li>
    <li> Is this really shany? I couldn&#x27;t find any label on it. Anyway could&#x27;n use it, either.  Because it was all broken.</li>
    <li> this palette is really beautiful. the colors are bright and are really pigmented, which is WONDERFUL!! the reason why i say it is 99% fab is because while the colors are bright and pigmented, the shimmer in the color really brightens the color. so they are about 99% true to color. dont get me wrong, you WILL NOT be dissapointed. i love it and highly recommend it. enjoy it!</li>
    <li> My daughters love this eyeshadow! It stays on, the colors are great, and lasts a long time. I have purchased a few times because you can&#x27;t beat the price. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled. This is NOT Shanty. Never heard of the brand they sent; \\&quot; starry\\&quot;. Arrived damaged. Not very encouraged at this point.</li>
    <li> I love this! yes its 24 colors but 2 colors are mixed together and i Love it! its great gives off a pretty look on your eye when you put it on! you should all totally try it! highly recommend! the colors are so pigmented! get it now!</li>
    <li> What better way to have Makeup when it can be mutliply colors in one! I recommend anyone to have this because it&#x27;s a really nice palette!</li>
    <li> Lovely, shimmering shades in complementary colors. Very easy to customize, work great as both shadows and liners. I love that the shades are two-toned, so you can mix or just use one. I&#x27;d definitely recommend to people starting to build their make-up collections.</li>
    <li> These are just.... wow. Freaking pretty! Right? I love the whole multi effect thing. And velvet to the touch... come on who doesn&#x27;t love that! So smooth to apply.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on this product and saw the negative reviews. Despite this, the positive ones outweighed them for me and, because the price is so low, I took the risk. I am glad that I did. I especially liked the reviews that had customer pictures of different techniques using the makeup. So far I have been very pleased with this eyeshadow and I like having some more unusual colors to work with. I think with a primer it will be very vibrant and long-wearing, since the results without are so good.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does say Starry and not Shany on the package, as some have mentioned. I don&#x27;t know what this is, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have made a difference. I hope this helps you decide if you are on the fence.</li>
    <li> These eye shadows are so pretty! They go on smooth and evenly and last all day without creasing or fading. These shadows are so soft an light feeling I just love them.</li>
    <li> It interest me that there is 2 different color in one shadow, probably that&#x27;s how it gives the multi effect. I&#x27;m looking forward in trying this.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the quality of this eyeshadow kit for the price. The colors are very vivid, go on smoothly and blend easily. Add a good eye primer and you have a beautiful all day look! These colors are metallic so keep that in mind when ordering.</li>
    <li> goes on beautifuly silky. Well pigmented and beautiful on skin. I would reccomend this to everyone. Will be giving this as gifts for christmas. :-) :-) :-)</li>
    <li> Very bright and shiny. I have fair skin and it does NOT look good on me. Still, I do makeup for movies and it has come in handy as a prop and as a resource for preparing talent for shoots.</li>
    <li> Love the colors,which of course are very colorful and pigmented as alway because they are Shany! Love the mirror as well</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors. Personally, I hate small palettes, but I&#x27;d buy this one simply for the colors that it has in it. I love the green and the blue one especially.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Soooo smooth and the pigmentation is incredible. I LOVE that you can use these shadows both wet and dry and get completely different look. I can&#x27;t wait to use it more and see what kinds of looks I can get</li>
    <li> these colors are so pretty! there very silky and easy to apply! the colors are very pigmented and good quality</li>
    <li> This palette is perfect!! The colors are super pigmented and the consistency is like pure silk gliding on. The colors lasted all day and never fade!! This is high quality and a must have for any makeup user out there!</li>
    <li> Pigmented, blendable colors and sooooo smooth. This palette has a little bit of everything. Everything was shipped in tact. As always, a great Shany product!</li>
    <li> OMG! This palette is marvelous! I love the \\&quot;velvet touch\\&quot; feature that these eyeshadows have! The mirror is perfect size and the choices of colors are sweet too! It&#x27;s fun to mix up and play up my loook!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this palette.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Vibrant ,rich colors that would stay all day .I have a lot of name brand eye shadows which are more expensive but it works much much better than them.Highly recommended</li>
