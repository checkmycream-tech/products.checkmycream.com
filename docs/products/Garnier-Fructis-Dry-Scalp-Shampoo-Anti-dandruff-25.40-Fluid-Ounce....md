<ol>
      <li>Very good.</li>
      <li>Good ol&#x27; Amazon to the rescue!</li>
      <li>I have tried so many shampoos for scalp, this one is the best and the best for the hair as well .</li>
      <li>But after reading the great reviews decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Now can&#x27;t find this in the stores in Ohio either, but great to find it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a week of using it, I found a great improvement.</li>
      <li>I was extremely happy when I found it on Amazon, because when Momma&#x27;s happy everybody&#x27;s Happy....LOL</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!!</li>
      <li>Got a good deal on this one.</li>
      <li>It smells really good</li>
      <li>This shampoo works great, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;dandruff shampoo smell&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>It lathers up nicely as well as getting rid of itch, and it smells great.  </li>
      <li>And it smells good as well.</li>
      <li>This is some good shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This has a triple benefit, and this manufacturer could stand to make millions more dollars, given the effect of the anti-aging, ant-graying, and anti-balding that this product has, along with the anti-dandruff!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing to me that no one else has a formula that works for him.</li>
      <li>I have tried many types and while they have good ratings and rave reviews (which they do deserve)</li>
      <li>It also smells good and keeps my hair clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product dries my scalp more.  </li>
      <li>It works much better.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>This works every time, for me, and I love it.</li>
      <li>But I can´t find it in stores any more , so I think it´s discontinued .</li>
      <li>Love it , will be buying more soon.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, it is the only shampoo that stops my dandruff.</li>
      <li>Why do you want more words.  </li>
      <li>Love this product....</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff for a dry scalp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth buying online!</li>
      <li>I was drawn to it because I love the smell of Garnier shampoos, and this one smelled as good as any other, but it didn&#x27;t help with my dandruff.</li>
      <li>I returned this product for a full refund.</li>
      <li>I will always be a loyal user.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After the very first shampoo, all of the flakes were gone</li>
      <li>but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this many times yet, but so far I like it.  </li>
      <li>His hair is soft, brown, and much controlled as far as his dermatitits from dandruff, not to mention, it restored his natural hair color and even caused some of his male-patterned baldness to fill in with fine tufts of hair, which beats no hair at all!!!!  </li>
      <li>I was in need of a dandruff shampoo, and because I&#x27;ve used and enjoyed other Garnier Fructis haircare products, I was excited when I saw they had a dandruff shampoo available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad we don&#x27;t have to waste money finding the right product any more.</li>
      <li>It was fine for my hair itself, as it left it clean and shiny, so I have no complaints there.</li>
      <li>Looking for a nice smell and shampoo that actually works in dandruff control, then I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>Really like how my hair looks after I use Garnier Fructis!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok to give short responses</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just not as effective on his dandruff as other products.</li>
      <li>After first shampoo, VERY noticeable results.  </li>
      <li>It is MUCH drier in Colorado.  </li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>it really works.  </li>
      <li>I really hope they keep making this product.</li>
      <li>And this thing worked, it really did, couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
      <li>So much so that I have to buy it online now</li>
      <li>His scalp is so sensitive - he has tried many shampoos and has finally found Fructus.  </li>
      <li>Works better for me than Selsun Blue(sp?), or any other - have tried just about everything.</li>
      <li>It simply smells clean.</li>
      <li>so i consider myself lucky but standard</li>
      <li>My order from you allows me to have my favorite shampoo available for at least the next year.</li>
      <li>Like many people with dry scalp/itching/flaking problems, I have been on a continuous path of discovery to try and find the magicial elixir that would finally get rid of this problem.  </li>
      <li>if not I hope you find the right one sooner rather than later.</li>
      <li>Then I moved out to my new home in Boulder, CO.  </li>
      <li>Was brand new.</li>
      <li>only one  what  really  </li>
      <li>Well here I am, 26 year old man and</li>
      <li>so far, it has not made any difference at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since tried Head and Shoulders, and my scalp is much improved, so I&#x27;d have to recommend that brand over this one if you want a dandruff shampoo that actually does what you&#x27;d expect a dandruff shampoo to do.</li>
      <li>the only shampoo that ever really helped with my dandruff, couldnt find it anywhere, didnt even occur to me to check on here</li>
      <li>I had a mess to clean up from the spill because they were not secured for shipment.</li>
      <li>I used to live in Atlanta, and since it was more humid and warmer, I usually had less issues.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo also did not make my tempermental red hair color run, as other shampoos that claimed to be gentle did!</li>
      <li>I am always weary about trying new hair products because my hair is very curly and a little bit on the dry side.</li>
      <li>I tried Head &amp; Shoulders, but it seemed to dry out my scalp even more and make the problem worse, along with drying out my hair</li>

<li> It contains some of the same items in its formula as other shampoos, but somehow Fructis is the only one that works for me.</li>
<li> I guess that it&#x27;s all about the active ingredient that is used in the product, and interestingly enough, I had never heard of pyrithione zinc in any of the other products I tried, which btw include (head &amp; shoulder, Nuetrogena T-Gel, Selsun Blue, all the big names, and even a medicated shampoo from my dermatologist.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d previously tried a store brand to try to save money, but apparently I got what I paid for, as my dry scalp saw no improvement.</li>
<li> I have tried tar shampoos and other shampoos, but the only product that works for me is Garnier Fructis Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Fructis Anti-Dandruff % Conditioner.  </li>
<li> My hubby has dry scalp in a couple spots on his head.</li>
<li> but Garnier Fructis Dry Scalp Shampoo does the job.</li>
<li> It supposed to help with dry scalp.  </li>
<li> Let me say that my biggest problem is dry scalp and flaking, my scalp doesn&#x27;t get oily.  </li>
<li> He has no flaking and says his hair feels healthier and not as dry.  </li>
<li> I was using it every time I shampooed, and my scalp stayed as dry and itchy as before I started using it.</li>
<li> While I would have used it everyday, I just don&#x27;t have enough hair to go through an entire 25.4 oz bottle of shampoo (let alone two bottles) in three month&#x27;s time.  </li>
<li> If you want to get rid of your dandruff AND soothe your dry scalp, this is the shampoo for you!</li>
<li> I have now been using Garnier Fructis Anti-Dandruff for years because its one of the few shampoos that actually keeps away my dandruff and reduces/eliminates itchiness.</li>
<li> But I should point out that I was also using one of Garnier&#x27;s conditioners at the same time, so I&#x27;m not sure if it was the shampoo or the conditioner that deserves the credit.    </li>
<li> I have to  try  some  other  chipper  options.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m still using a Garnier conditioner with the Head and Shoulders shampoo, so I have nothing against Garnier products in general, but this particular one was a disappointment for me.</li>
<li> The product also adds body so do not let it run down and over your body in the shower or you will look fat.</li>
<li> It has also recently been dyed red, which is a difficult color to maintain.&lt;br</li>
<li> Use it regularly and hard to find in stores!</li>
<li> and I put alot of value in my hair, so as you can imagine, I was extremely embarrassed!!</li>
<li> in the past few months before using this product, my scalp had been getting progressively itchy.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I had the same experience with this shampoo.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not going to sugar-coat the smell, because it is definitely not as fragrant or pleasing as shampoos by Herbal Essences or Suave, but it doesn&#x27;t reek of chemicals or have a weird smell.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it in store...</li>
<li> Takes care of the dandruff problem without making your hair hard,</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so hard to find though.</li>
<li> And I guess if that is your issue, this stuff at least deserves a try.</li>
<li> It was discontinued in retail stores at least here in Louisiana.</li>
<li> Oh well at least Amazon sells it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> At least if he wanted extensions, there would be hair there to anchor them to.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the expiration dates on both bottles were less than three months from the day I received them in the mail.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is almost impossible, for me, to find anymore. So much so that I have to buy it online now but it is worth it. I don&#x27;t have a serious issue with my scalp so i consider myself lucky but standard shampoo doesn&#x27;t do it anymore. This works every time, for me, and I love it. Not all shampoos work well for everyone. I have tried many types and while they have good ratings and rave reviews (which they do deserve) they didn&#x27;t work that way for me so it is a hit and miss thing but Garnier Fructis Dry Scalp Shampoo does the job. Hopefully it will work for you as well but if not I hope you find the right one sooner rather than later.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a dandruff shampoo, and because I&#x27;ve used and enjoyed other Garnier Fructis haircare products, I was excited when I saw they had a dandruff shampoo available.

    <li> I used to get this from walmart and it worked well but this bottle didn&#x27;t seem to work that well. It was not expired (I checked). I ended up switching to Biotera Scalp Refresh Cooling Mint Shampoo. It works much better.</li>
    <li> Love this product....it really works.  I looked all over town for it, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!!  Don&#x27;t know if it was sold out or just not stocked anymore.  I found it on Amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this many times yet, but so far I like it.  It lathers up nicely as well as getting rid of itch, and it smells great.  :)</li>
    <li> I have now been using Garnier Fructis Anti-Dandruff for years because its one of the few shampoos that actually keeps away my dandruff and reduces/eliminates itchiness. It also smells good and keeps my hair clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I can never seem to find the larger sizes in stores. Oh well at least Amazon sells it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such an under-rated shampoo. I really hope they keep making this product. I will always be a loyal user.</li>
    <li> Like many people with dry scalp/itching/flaking problems, I have been on a continuous path of discovery to try and find the magicial elixir that would finally get rid of this problem.  I used to live in Atlanta, and since it was more humid and warmer, I usually had less issues.  Then I moved out to my new home in Boulder, CO.  It is MUCH drier in Colorado.  The winters are crazy, I get shocked from everything walking around my house, bc the air is so damn dry.    Enter Garnier Fructis commercial that I saw about 2 weeks ago, claiming that they have a money-back guarantee if the product doesn&#x27;t work. So, I thought, ah what the hell, I&#x27;ll give &#x27;er a try.  After first shampoo, VERY noticeable results.  After second use, flaking is practically non-existent.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I guess that it&#x27;s all about the active ingredient that is used in the product, and interestingly enough, I had never heard of pyrithione zinc in any of the other products I tried, which btw include (head &amp; shoulder, Nuetrogena T-Gel, Selsun Blue, all the big names, and even a medicated shampoo from my dermatologist.  And this thing worked, it really did, couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Let me say that my biggest problem is dry scalp and flaking, my scalp doesn&#x27;t get oily.  And I guess if that is your issue, this stuff at least deserves a try.</li>
    <li> so far, it has not made any difference at all.</li>
    <li> Been using for 4 years after could no longer find the Pantene version (same ingredients) in the store.  Now can&#x27;t find this in the stores in Ohio either, but great to find it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.  Works better for me than Selsun Blue(sp?), or any other - have tried just about everything.</li>
    <li> the only shampoo that ever really helped with my dandruff, couldnt find it anywhere, didnt even occur to me to check on here and it was!</li>
    <li> My hubby has dry scalp in a couple spots on his head. Nothing else works to make it go away but this shampoo. It&#x27;s amazing to me that no one else has a formula that works for him. I&#x27;m just glad we don&#x27;t have to waste money finding the right product any more.</li>
    <li> Was brand new. Shipping box was in grate shape too.</li>
    <li> Well here I am, 26 year old man and im buying freaking shampoo on the internet. What has the world come to.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife it&#x27;s the only shampoo that works for her....It was discontinued in retail stores at least here in Louisiana.And to here her talk the World was coming to an end.I was extremely happy when I found it on Amazon, because when Momma&#x27;s happy everybody&#x27;s Happy....LOL</li>
    <li> Love it , will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> It is no longer being made, and what a dismal shame!!!  His hair is soft, brown, and much controlled as far as his dermatitits from dandruff, not to mention, it restored his natural hair color and even caused some of his male-patterned baldness to fill in with fine tufts of hair, which beats no hair at all!!!!  At least if he wanted extensions, there would be hair there to anchor them to.  Think about begging the manufacturer of this product to continue it.  This has a triple benefit, and this manufacturer could stand to make millions more dollars, given the effect of the anti-aging, ant-graying, and anti-balding that this product has, along with the anti-dandruff!</li>
    <li> Very good. But you have to look for it everywhere. Not all stores have it, CVS, Walgreens does not have it either.&lt;br /&gt;In a week of using it, I found a great improvement.</li>
    <li> This is some good shampoo.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it in store...Got a good deal on this one.</li>
    <li> I am always weary about trying new hair products because my hair is very curly and a little bit on the dry side. It has also recently been dyed red, which is a difficult color to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had problems with dandruff but in the past few months before using this product, my scalp had been getting progressively itchy. Having curly hair, I get compliments all of the time and I put alot of value in my hair, so as you can imagine, I was extremely embarrassed!! I tried Head &amp; Shoulders, but it seemed to dry out my scalp even more and make the problem worse, along with drying out my hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the very first shampoo, all of the flakes were gone and I did not scratch my head again until the next day just before I had done another shampoo. The shampoo also did not make my tempermental red hair color run, as other shampoos that claimed to be gentle did! I would recommend this shampoo to anyone! I&#x27;m not going to sugar-coat the smell, because it is definitely not as fragrant or pleasing as shampoos by Herbal Essences or Suave, but it doesn&#x27;t reek of chemicals or have a weird smell. It simply smells clean. If you want to get rid of your dandruff AND soothe your dry scalp, this is the shampoo for you!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!! It&#x27;s so hard to find though. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere around me. It&#x27;s worth buying online!</li>
    <li> I have had dandruff for years.  I have tried tar shampoos and other shampoos, but the only product that works for me is Garnier Fructis Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Fructis Anti-Dandruff % Conditioner.  It contains some of the same items in its formula as other shampoos, but somehow Fructis is the only one that works for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;dandruff shampoo smell&#x27;.  I used to buy it locally, but the store stopped carrying it.  Good ol&#x27; Amazon to the rescue!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  a very  sad,  that  Garnier discontinued  to produce  this  shampoo,  it&#x27;s  only one  what  really  work  on my  scalp.  In  Amazon it&#x27;s so  expensive,  compare  how  it was  in drugstores.For  this  reason, this one ,probably  ,last  bootle  of  this  product,  what  I  bought.I have to  try  some  other  chipper  options.</li>
    <li> Use it regularly and hard to find in stores! Really like how my hair looks after I use Garnier Fructis!</li>
    <li> Takes care of the dandruff problem without making your hair hard,</li>
    <li> His scalp is so sensitive - he has tried many shampoos and has finally found Fructus.  He has no flaking and says his hair feels healthier and not as dry.  He is on his 3rd bottle.  We can&#x27;t find the anti-dandruff in stores - thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many shampoos for scalp, this one is the best and the best for the hair as well . But I can´t find it in stores any more , so I think it´s discontinued .</li>
    <li> Looking for a nice smell and shampoo that actually works in dandruff control, then I highly recommend this product.  I can&#x27;t even go to another brand without a big dandruff come back.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for a dry scalp. And it smells good as well. I did notice it starting to disappear in the stores so I bought it here</li>
    <li> My order from you allows me to have my favorite shampoo available for at least the next year. Don&#x27;t know what I will do then. These containers have a tendency to come open in the shopping bags. That is just what happened to several of the bottles. I had a mess to clean up from the spill because they were not secured for shipment.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, it is the only shampoo that stops my dandruff. The product also adds body so do not let it run down and over your body in the shower or you will look fat.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son. It smells really good but it&#x27;s just not as effective on his dandruff as other products.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased two bottles of this shampoo from Amazon.  Unfortunately, the expiration dates on both bottles were less than three months from the day I received them in the mail.  While I would have used it everyday, I just don&#x27;t have enough hair to go through an entire 25.4 oz bottle of shampoo (let alone two bottles) in three month&#x27;s time.  I returned this product for a full refund.</li>
    <li> Has the same key ingredient as Head&amp;Shoulders which doesn&#x27;t work for me. So I was leery trying it. But after reading the great reviews decided to give it a try. Nope. Did absolutely nothing. If Head&amp;Shoulders doesn&#x27;t work for you, neither will this product.</li>
    <li> It supposed to help with dry scalp.  This product dries my scalp more.  Why do you want more words.  It&#x27;s ok to give short responses</li>
</ol>
