      <li>I don&#x27;t have any money to go buy a wig or even buy more hair.  </li>
      <li>The shedding does make it look thinner at the ends, but once I added on more pack to it, it looked like I grew it again.</li>

      <li>No problem with the shipment, once we knew it was on its way, it was easy to track.</li>
      <li>It looks nice when you first put it in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quality was great at first and then it became real knotty and tangled.</li>
      <li>I wish the bundles where a little fuller but the quality is excellent!</li>
      <li>I was happy that this product actually arrived ealier than promised.</li>
      <li>She love it so much, now her heir is beautiful, like human</li>
      <li>I excitedly booked my appointment to get it put in.</li>
      <li>This hair is suppose to be 100% good quality hair, but when I first purchased it, it was soft and wavy.</li>
      <li>thought the bundles was going to be more full, but thanks again.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll remove a full bundle .</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t full at all.</li>
      <li>The WEFTS ARE FULL</li>
      <li>thanks!!</li>
      <li>.it was beautiful in a week it started to tangle,was not satisfied one bit....</li>
      <li>Well when I first got the hair it was pretty and the waves were accurate, but then when I washed the waves fell out and it was super straight</li>
      <li>texture is just right</li>
      <li>After about a week I was completely done with this hair , I removed it to find huge gaps where hair should be on the tracks , it thinned out tremendously .</li>
      <li>Hair nice and thick at top sparse on ends.</li>
      <li>My feelings are slightly mixed about it because the add says no shedding, however, it probably shed because I wasn&#x27;t sure of what to put on it to maintain it in the beginning.</li>
      <li>I am very unsatisfied with this hair!  </li>
      <li>so it looks better.the body waves disappear from the first week of having it in my hair.</li>
      <li>it reaches my hip exactly where I wanted .the</li>
      <li>3 IT IS PRETTY WHEN YOU FIRST GET IT.</li>
      <li>this hair was pretty on the install</li>
      <li>good weave a waste of money</li>
      <li>Iam obsessed wit my hair :) !!!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t tangle at first, but then just like real hair</li>
      <li>Its was thinner than I expected and there wasn&#x27;t much hair at all but its really soft and good quality hair</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s soft inch is true to length fast shipping</li>
      <li>The hair was held on by pure imagination because all it took was a run through the with your hand</li>
      <li>It came in an envelope at first sight the hair looked healthy, thin for 100g each but healthy, the ends were noce</li>
      <li>When I opened the packet everything was there as I expected and the wefts were very filled.</li>
      <li>I was very unsastisfied with this hair.</li>
      <li>Grate deal real hair must buy</li>
      <li>It got tangled fast</li>
      <li>I noticed a very funky smell, but thought that it was because of the delivery/packing.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t real Brazilian hair.</li>
      <li>I had to cut so much off, by the time I was done, it was a 18\\</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t flow and sheds soo much from me trying to untangle it.</li>
      <li>This hair shed sooo much , it affected my career.</li>
      <li>It holds curls, flex rods, crinkle irons curls really well.</li>
      <li>very misleading.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
      <li>, we decided to give the hair a clean rinse--with only plain, warm water.</li>
      <li>could of did better other tan</li>
      <li>It wont return to the natural curl that it had when it first came in.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!</li>
      <li>The hair is thin, shedding a lot, and didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
      <li>First of all I was under the impression that I would be receiving LOOSE WAVE, I received body wave in pink retail packaging that said human hair,(although the packaging was not a factor) I have been purchasing virgin hair a while before it ever became popular in the states from China.</li>
      <li>and it went right back to that natural wave.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok not satisfied,</li>
      <li>This was my first and last purchase.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hair awful do not buy!!!!</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied the hair lasted a week.  And i had hair that last over a year including multiple washes. I would have returned it but i had know idea the hair would look undesirable,  thin. I expected it to last longer although the grade wasnt A+  to me.  Im a very disappointed customer &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Hair stinks. The hair is thin like it has been used. Doesn&#x27;t look nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> i love the length i just hate that it sheds so much and it gets tangled even after washing and conditioning at the end of the day its tangled</li>
    <li> Love the weave.got more than i expected.got order before time.great customer service</li>
    <li> Horrible quality ! Hair tangles &amp; sheds . Dont waste your time or money with this vendor</li>
    <li> Not what they promise. I received 5 50 gms each of silky hair. Not wavy. Hair nice and thick at top sparse on ends. All were approximately 16 inches... No stars.</li>
    <li> This hair did not have no labels all of it look the same and the ends are extremely thin.</li>
    <li> very thin and sheds horribly</li>
    <li> Lol y&#x27;all should be ashamed for selling ppl this hair! Lmao!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I bought this hair and I didn&#x27;t care for it at all. So I did more research and found The Good Life Hair Company and I haven&#x27;t looked back since! I&#x27;m team Good Life Hair Company now.</li>
    <li> This is horrible hair. It sheads terrible and tangles real bad. I am a stylist and I know how to maintain virgin hair. But even with proper maintanice of this hair its still no good at all. It wont return to the natural curl that it had when it first came in.</li>
    <li> its good hair for a week but its not tangle free.good hair but not as described I&#x27;m going to color it today and tell you about it.</li>
    <li> Great weave loving it daily. Great service</li>
    <li> I knew the hair would be thin but not this thin. Wow.</li>
    <li> 😓😞😞😞😞 please be 100grms a bundle  I&#x27;m so scared that I will be unsatisfied by the reviews of the hair</li>
    <li> YOU GUYS SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO SEARCH FOR QUALITY VIRGIN HAIR FROM AMAZON! *sips tea and continues to read the horror stories*</li>
    <li> I really like this product, but the only problem is that it took so long before I got it!</li>
    <li> The hair seems to be excellent quality the texture of it seems natural . The delivery was on point and I had no delays or problems to report.Getting my hair done this weekend.😃😃😃😃</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t real Brazilian hair. I am very upset that I&#x27;ve wasted my money on this. It tangles, its sheds (a lot) and certainly isn&#x27;t worth anything more than 30 bucks! They should be ashamed for scamming people and false advertising.</li>
    <li> Super thin....hair is nice though!! I suggest buying 2 lots bundles are short</li>
    <li> Very thin lengths weren&#x27;t labeled and dry shedding crazy....I wish I could get my money back</li>
    <li> saying i was very disappointed, never had a bad encounter but i will stick with human hair direct for now on.. Very bad customer service, never got a reply back but they did see the email because they followed instructions as to how i wanted i packaged. It came in an envelope at first sight the hair looked healthy, thin for 100g each but healthy, the ends were noce i played with it and no shedding but the smell was awwwful!! It got tangled fast and i found bonding glue stuck to some of the hair on one.of the bundles not sre why it was there but im guessing it was carelessness of whoever was trying to seal the wefts. Bundles are very thin. Then come to realizationt hat its mixed with sy thetic hair it matted up smh wouldnt advise nobody to purchase</li>
    <li> Try going to [...] where you will find hair that not only lasts but you would only need two bundles. You also have the opportunity for signing up to get money for sharing where you buy your hair. Go to my website to find out more info.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Really Good Hair I Can&#x27;t Wait To Color It</li>
    <li> This is very good and original waves. My customers and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered two more already and I will be placing order for another 10 sets soon</li>
    <li> this hair was pretty on the install but as soon as the hair got wet not only did the wave go straight but the color started to wash out too.  I guess the virgin untreated part as well as 100% human hair was a lie, the synthetic fillers in this hair burnt out when i used a curling iron and afterward the hair smelled like burnt plastic and i couldnt get the smell out.</li>
    <li> This hair freaking sucks!</li>
    <li> it hasn&#x27;t even been 3mths yet and i looks horrible i know weave and this is not good weave a waste of money, i see the price went down i would like a refund......</li>
    <li> tHIS HAIR IS FAR MORE THE WORST HAIR I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!!! TERRIBLE IT TANGLES AFTER 3 DAYS .. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS EVERRRRRRRRR AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> Hair is extremely thin, definitely NOT 300 grams</li>
    <li> I ordered a mixed length of 20,22,24 inch hair when I received it it smell like it had been in a warehouse for years .. After getting it installed for which I paid an addition $150 one week late I had to get it cut out because as soon as it got wet the hair immediately tangled up.the curls do not stay in tack and there customer service after asking me to remove my first review was terrible</li>
    <li> I love the hair but I dislike the ends they are so brittle no matter how much I flat iron it. It curls well love it but them ends honey woo.</li>
    <li> First of all I was under the impression that I would be receiving LOOSE WAVE, I received body wave in pink retail packaging that said human hair,(although the packaging was not a factor) I have been purchasing virgin hair a while before it ever became popular in the states from China. I instantly knew when opening this hair that it was not virgin, it did not have a natural color and everything about it just looked WRONG! I didn&#x27;t take the time to read the reviews until now which was my mistake because I make sure to read them on every hair purchase I make from vendors over seas. This is a waste of time &amp; money and i&#x27;m pretty sure you can purchase this same hair I was sent from your local beauty supply for half the price or less. I&#x27;m just grateful that amazon has free returns because I will be needing a refund INDEFINITELY!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair curls well. Its doesnt bleach well tho. No shedding so far its wave always come back after washing.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed bout my hair the bundles are suppose to b 100 gram a bundle they are not they are very thin could of did better other tan that it&#x27;s soft inch is true to length fast shipping</li>
    <li> This hair shed half of its bundle in two days</li>
    <li> I AM CHANGING MY REVIEW AFTER PUTTING HAIR OIL IN THE TANGLED HAIR I BRUSHED IT AND IT MADE IT MORE MANAGEABLE . I GIVE THE HAIR A 3 IT IS PRETTY WHEN YOU FIRST GET IT.</li>
    <li> The Longer Tbe Bundles The Thinner They Are Ladies</li>
    <li> smh its a good hair til 3weeks later its all bad but if u want to try it its on u . never again</li>
    <li> Please do not buy, its fake, thin and stinks. He&#x27;s on ebay selling it for $86.00. Please do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this hair. It&#x27;s quality was great at first and then it became real knotty and tangled. I am not pleased.!!! I will have to bite the bullet and buy hair from another place that is known for it&#x27;s good quality hair. This was my first and last purchase.</li>
    <li> The hair is very little bit &amp; look the same lengths to me, just one looks a little longer by a few strands but it&#x27;s ok not satisfied, thought the bundles was going to be more full, but thanks again.</li>
    <li> I love the hair!!!!!!!........ it reaches my hip exactly where I wanted .the texture is just right I do recommend this hair to everybody I know.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it trust me. This company should be shut down,  worst hair ever. I am beyond disappointed that words cannot even explain.</li>
    <li> Grate deal real hair must buy</li>
    <li> That hair was terrible and I really want my money back!</li>
    <li> Not human hair it&#x27;s a blend horrible horrible hair it&#x27;s not 300 grams either it&#x27;s 200 I sent this back for a refund didn&#x27;t even bother to use</li>
    <li> This hair is suppose to be 100% good quality hair, but when I first purchased it, it was soft and wavy. After like 2 weeks it started to shed and tangle.</li>
    <li> The texture of the hair is soft but brittle,  I try dying to blond it came out grey, my  hair stylist have to put a different color on it so it looks better.the body waves disappear from the first week of having it in my hair. It sheds and breaks,Overall not the best hair.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered this hair for me as a Christmas gift. I added it my wish list and received it maybe 4 days after he ordered so the shipping time is excellent. I wanted it to come in 1b so- only 1 bundle was 1b so I had to spend extra time dying it before the install. It didn&#x27;t tangle at first, but then just like real hair, it did, so I used a tiny bit of pink lotion on it to keep it soft and luxurious looking. That seems to work best on it. I have since washed it and restyled it. It holds curls, flex rods, crinkle irons curls really well. I&#x27;ve gotten multiple compliments on it. The shedding does make it look thinner at the ends, but once I added on more pack to it, it looked like I grew it again. My feelings are slightly mixed about it because the add says no shedding, however, it probably shed because I wasn&#x27;t sure of what to put on it to maintain it in the beginning. The pink lotion moisturizer seems to be working well. Now, my favorite part is the curl pattern. I flex rod it and HATED the huge curls so I just wet it down and it went right back to that natural wave. Wish I could post a pic. It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>

    <li> The hair was thin n sheds bad n tangles n it&#x27;s very poor I don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
    <li> The hair is thin, shedding a lot, and didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
    <li> Its was thinner than I expected and there wasn&#x27;t much hair at all but its really soft and good quality hair just wish it was thicker and more hair</li>
    <li> Soft &amp; Bouncy Didnt Install Yet But This Is Really Nice Hair .</li>
    <li> upon receiving this hair i was very unsatisfied.it was too small and it could not do my entire hair.the image i saw is a total different thing from the one i got. very misleading.</li>
    <li> Hair sheds terribly and my hair wasn&#x27;t even the right inches I ordered my sister and I both brought the same lengths and my hair is shorter than hers won&#x27;t get my money again</li>
    <li> THIS HAIR IS HORRIBLE .. IS REALLY THIN AND ITS PRE-COLORED . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!</li>
    <li> The Hair Didn&#x27;t Last A Month</li>
    <li> This was the Worst hair I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life . It was shedding before I even put it in . It had a very synthetic feel and appearance and was very rough and stiff straight outta the package . This hair shed sooo much , it affected my career. Loose hairs is frowned upon in the military and all throughout the day I was picking hair off my uniform . Mind you I wore it in a bun , and it still shed . Constantly . After about a week I was completely done with this hair , I removed it to find huge gaps where hair should be on the tracks , it thinned out tremendously . The hair was held on by pure imagination because all it took was a run through the with your hand and you&#x27;ll remove a full bundle . Don&#x27;t buy this hair .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with that hair a orders is good</li>
    <li> Good delivery time and good product.</li>
    <li> The Product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all. I don&#x27;t even think the individual packs are up to 100grams, it&#x27;s so so scanty and worse of all its shedding off so bad</li>
    <li> When I got it.. .it was beautiful in a week it started to tangle,was not satisfied one bit....a waste of money</li>
    <li> She love it so much, now her heir is beautiful, like human heir.&lt;br /&gt;She is my sunshine, perfect like I see in web.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy, buy it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This was the worst hair I&#x27;ve ever received. But I too was bargain shopping. I had my hair done on Nov. 20th &amp; today Nov. 26th I&#x27;m getting it re done. I had to take that mess out my head. I should have received a 24\\&quot; which it was, but the ends were so split, it look like spaghetti strings hanging. It wasn&#x27;t full at all. I had to cut so much off, by the time I was done, it was a 18\\&quot; (maybe). I was very disappointed &amp; will never order from this site again. Neither will I recommend anyone. But as I stated I was bargain shopping...(never again)</li>
    <li> The hair is thin . And it sheds horribly.  I will never order this hair again I do not recommend anyone to buy this hair</li>
    <li> Well when I first got the hair it was pretty and the waves were accurate, but then when I washed the waves fell out and it was super straight and the ends were very thin. But when I let it dry the waves came back a little. And it sheds</li>
    <li> Beautifull i luv it ....</li>
    <li> This hair is so thin it will not cover half of a head and the end of the hair is super thin. I&#x27;m so unhappy and I&#x27;m having a 50th birthday red carpet party and was unable to get my hair done. I have hair loss and I couldn&#x27;t get my money back from the beautician due to not having the hair to go to mi appointment.  I am going to cry because by the time I received the return label my party is over. I don&#x27;t have any money to go buy a wig or even buy more hair.  I sorry that I&#x27;m raving bit I&#x27;m so hurt by Amazon and the waiting period I have to wait to get my money back. I had to put 1 star in order to rate it, but i give it a ZERO 0</li>
    <li> The hair I recieved is very thin, and 1 bundle is one track long I brought 4 bundles and its not even enough for a full head of hair! I want my money back! this is a scam!</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Please ladies don&#x27;t buy this hair please , is shades like crazy</li>
    <li> I was very unsastisfied with this hair. I put this review up as a warning. This hair looks great and amazing when u first get it. Once Installed the hair I knew something was wrong. I wear weave so I know real weave from fake. I could have spent this money on higher quality hair. I knew instantly this hair was synthetic. Just to prove my theory I did the burn test which u can find on YouTube. I burned strands of it and they clumped up like synthetic hair. The hair tangles CONSTANTLY. doesn&#x27;t flow and sheds soo much from me trying to untangle it. Also once I washed it the curl pattern never returned. I&#x27;m so unhappy with this product and wished I purchased elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Horrible hair, plenty shedding</li>
    <li> April Jones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair was shipped and packed professionally. However, the hair did have a smell to it which is an indication that it is not Virgin Hair. I purchased the hair as a gift to a family member who was extremely happy with the hair. I am only giving this hair 3 stars because of the smell. If I purchased anything else with a smell I would have returned it thinking something was wrong with it. Since this was a gift I did not want to disappoint BUTif I were purchasing this for myself I would have returned it</li>
    <li> Waiting on my hair to arrive I hope I want be disappointed after reading the comments 😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞</li>
    <li> It looks nice when you first put it in but it gets tangled alot &amp; you constantly have to brush it out .</li>
    <li> Will never buy this hair or any hair from this guy any more! Hair is not what promises! THIN AND NOT EVEN 3 FULL BUNDLES! WHEN YOU PUT IT TOGETHER PROBABLY ONE!</li>
    <li> When the hair arrived it seemed soft it looked nice until my Daughter washed hair ,it turned frizzy and nappy she could even flat Iron it .</li>
    <li> Very confused sellers pls do not purchase</li>
    <li> I KNOW that this IS NOT 300GRAMS OF HAIR!!!!! The WEFTS ARE FULL BUT THE ENDS ARE SSSOOOO THIN THAT ALL 3 BUNDLES LOOK LIKE 50GRAMS AT THR ENDS 💯 I&#x27;m disappointed frfr and this is false advertisement to the MAX!!! The pattern didn&#x27;t even keep as u can see, its already messing up and its installed yet, smmfh...... STINJY ENDS, NOT ENOUGH HAIR, NOT 300GRAMS AT ALL!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not full bundles not  full length don&#x27;t waste your time you get what you pay for. Sheds not virgin hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair..it is nice and the hair texture is wonderful.. Iam obsessed wit my hair :) !!! Will continue to get hair from here..thanks!!</li>
    <li> I am very unsatisfied with this hair!  It looks amazing when you receive it but once installed it sheds like crazy and tangles just as easy.  Very poor grade of hair!  Do not waste your money on this trash. I gave it 1 star because giving it none was not an option....</li>
    <li> I wish the bundles where a little fuller but the quality is excellent! Waiting to see how it takes to lightener &amp; color</li>
    <li> The hair sheds a lot it don&#x27;t even look 24 inches &amp; the waves do not last I&#x27;m very disappointed  with this hair</li>
    <li> I love this hair,I got it on time. It&#x27;s just how I imagine it will be.</li>
    <li> Terrible as hell. It super thin and tangly. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good hair but it sheds</li>
    <li> I was happy that this product actually arrived ealier than promised. When I opened the packet everything was there as I expected and the wefts were very filled. I noticed a very funky smell, but thought that it was because of the delivery/packing. I excitedly booked my appointment to get it put in. My hairdresser agreed that it smelt funny, and while installying, it we noted that the hair felt &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; due to a very waxy buildup.&lt;br /&gt;There were no care instructions, so we decided that  I will wear it for a few days to see if the smell would wear off. IT DID NOT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Then, we decided to give the hair a clean rinse--with only plain, warm water. NOW THERE ARE NO CURLS IN THE HAIR!!!!! In addition, this hair sheds like crazy!!!!!! (unlike all the other unprocessed hair I have bought)!!!!! I SPENT ALOT OF MONEY HERE AND COULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS LOCALLY......VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!! NOT COOL. WILL NEVER ORDER FROM YOU AGAIN!!! WOULD LIKE A REFUND!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect bundles very big same as a product bid pay 120 plus form, very happy</li>
