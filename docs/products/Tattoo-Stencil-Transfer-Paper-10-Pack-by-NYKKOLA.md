<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item was as described and would recommend! Got for my Husband and he is excited to use it! Can&#x27;t wait to see his next tattoo!</li>
    <li> i am a very upset customer. i was needing and looking for my paper.it did not say it would take this long for me to receive it when i ordered.why is it taking so long. i have never had to wit this long for any product &amp; may not ever order again from this seller.i am very angry.</li>
    <li> This came early in perfect</li>
    <li> I got my package of items quicker than I thought I would get it. :)  There were NO instructions on how to use the product.  But everything I have ordered on Amazon, only 1 item had instructions.  That is what the internet is for, looking for instructions.  I like it all.</li>
    <li> These were nothing like other practice skins I had before. Don&#x27;t take ink nor do they have consistency. Can&#x27;t even see your work because when u wipe away it stains the skin. Pointless</li>
    <li> Great item.good shipping</li>
    <li> I choose this paper over any other because its long-lasting,&lt;br /&gt;its durable and you get bright lines every time.&lt;br /&gt;The best tattoo stencil transfer paper on the market!</li>
    <li> i got it today  i cant wait until my hubby opens it too thanks so much and the package was good looking</li>
    <li> this product came in not useable with the transfer papers all stuck together so I wont recomend it at all.</li>
    <li> I recieved the item sooner than expected the quality is awesome. I can&#x27;t wait to get going i recomend for anyone considering this product to go ahead and go for it</li>
    <li> I will be doing a lot of ordering from these people because they got the product to me SUPER fast and the transfer paper they use is awesome and doing the amount of tattoo\\&quot;s i do in a day i need good transfer paper, and if this stuff is that good then i bet the rest of there tattoo stuff is great, i just ordered a foot peddle for my power supply box because mine is messing up, well i hope you guys and girls there keep getting great stuff and doing such a great job getting it delivered so fast because my business is counting on it...FOR REAL!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say whether this is a great product or a bad one.  My tattoo sheets arrived loose in an envelope with no instructions.  It was about as unprofessional as you could imagine.  I&#x27;ll probably look around on the inet for clues how to process tattoos.  The seller sure didn&#x27;t provide anything.  Didn&#x27;t even bother with packaging.</li>
    <li> amazing stencil paper, they should put more in the package just as a bonus or something, its my recommendation to yall</li>
    <li> Paper works good.Bought it for my up and coming tattoo artist son and he likes it.Will definitely buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> This Tattoo Stencil Transfer Paper 8½\\&quot; X 11  is the best Tattoo Stencil Paper i have ever used Very Good to make Handmade Tattoo Stencil and so very easy to use in a Tattoo Stencil copper can make it darker or lighter with most coopers I will only use this Tattoo Stencil Transfer Paper A+ if you need Tattoo Stencil Transfer Paper Use this paper you will not go to any other !</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like what I was supposed to receive, when I went to open the package there was a rip on the side of the package and most of the stencil sheets were all messed up and looked like it had some water damage on the corners. I pulled apart the extra sheet and they were all stuck together and there were a lot of splotches of carbon on the extra sheet and its like that for everyone of them. Other than that it came before the estimated time.</li>
    <li> This paper is not worth the money or time waiting for it. I have to press super hard and retrace my lines 4-5 times to get ANYTHING and it&#x27;s still crap. Once on the body and working, after about 2-3 wipes, the stencil has mostly wiped away. Stay away from this!</li>
    <li> Though issues had a rose upon receiving the order both amazon and the seller contacted me to show their care and concern graciously refunding me the cost, I am thankful and will indeed continue shopping through amazon and the seller, I will not let it discourage me and I will encourage other shoppers that though mistakes happen amazon and sellers are always ready to access and fix the problem or problems that may arise immediately to ensure full satisfaction.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth order of this paper. Its perfect!!! It gets the job done! It transfers easy with a bar of soap. I love this paper</li>
    <li> hey they worked just like there suppost to work for 50 cents a sheet i liked what i got in the mail</li>
    <li> its exacly what i expected from the beggining it was alot of paper so u can draw and tattoo anybody.</li>
    <li> it makes my job more easy&lt;br /&gt;there for i just draw on the paper&lt;br /&gt;then turn around and put the desin&lt;br /&gt;on my arm</li>
    <li> I got this for Jagua Gel but it did not work very well. I will not purchase again. Poor Poor</li>
    <li> Loved dem dry work great cand wait to use den again.. in def.. gonna miss from u guys Thank alot</li>
    <li> I was really content with the quality of this paper, granted it was my first time using transfer paper, I think I&#x27;ve got it figured out now. :]</li>
    <li> I do not like this paper. You have to press hard to get the transfer through. Also the lines that transfer on the paper are thin and light. Put it on skin and it is almost too light to see.</li>
    <li> This came in handy for Halloween this year. What a great find</li>
    <li> actual spirit brand transfer paper, not this knock off Chinese crap. Beware of the crap stencil paper, this is the real deal SPIRIT paper</li>
    <li> This transfer paper arrived quickly and as described.....almost.    The product worked great at first and I used it to give myself a tiger chestpiece. After hours of hard work and using my bathroom mirror I was able to accomplish a pretty sick tat (the transfer was perfect and I could not have done this without it). Everything was great and my mom said she loved my new \\&quot;Sink\\&quot; sick ink for you non tatteders lolol) so I sat down at my personal computer (DELL F140 Skeezer) and went to type a five star review for this item but that&#x27;s when I started feeling a searing pain near my male-nipples.    I looked down to find the tiger biting and clawing at my sensitive pink titties, it gets worse from there...  The tiger immediately made eye contact with me and began to emit a horrible screech that broke 3 of my 5 glass dragon dildos. It then began to move around my skin and consume all of my other sick tats ( I had 3 lol probably more than u) and started s***ting blood that ended up marking most of my body.    Long story short: This company did NOT mention the ancient forbidden tree this paper was made from and now I have s*** tattooed all over my skin. 2 stars because I DID get a bunch of free ink and now most people call me \\&quot;Ink Boi\\&quot; but the curse is pretty painful and the tiger tends to tear voids into the nether and occasionally remove parts of my soul.    NOT FOR THE FEINT OF HART!!!1</li>
    <li> It got hear on time and it is really good stuff! Y&#x27;all are doing a good job with sending out y&#x27;all&#x27;s stuff to us!</li>
    <li> this will not transfer anything without transfer oil which it doesn&#x27;t come with. even with the oil i wasnt even able to get a good transfer of ink</li>
    <li> all the edges of every page has bled out, I&#x27;m sure this is not the sellers fault but still highly disappointing....</li>
    <li> was not what i ordered instead of tattoo transfer paper i received temp tatoos for kids you know the kind u lay on skin add water and have a tattoo what a fraud</li>
    <li> The transfer paper were all messed up. They were not binded together at the top how they are supposed to be and 5 ink pages were missing</li>
    <li> Perfect and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I ordered twice it always comes fast 😎 but today I got 12 instead of 10 so I&#x27;m even more excited thanks will order again soon 👍💯</li>
    <li> the transfer sheets are one of the top sheets i have had in my three years of tattooing. the shipment came in fast and i got it here even before the shipment was estimated on being here.</li>
    <li> Opens up a lot of options!!!</li>
    <li> at first i was like dang! this paper is horrible nothing sticks then i realized i was using the wrong side!!! after i figured it out this paper is excellent and sticks really good.</li>
    <li> My bf is a Polynesian tattoo artist. I always end up buying these same tattoo transfer sheets for him.&lt;br /&gt;According to him, these are the most simple, yet best transfer sheets you can get. Just don&#x27;t get them wet. Also, it transfer the stenciling onto the skin nicely without irritating the skin.</li>
    <li> perfect shipping time exactly what i was expecting works great and i love the product def. buying again when needed</li>
    <li> Makes the outline heavy and doesn&#x27;t rinse off for several days. Probably a good product for plastic surgeon to use for marking patterns.</li>
    <li> Ordered Friday Feb. 10,2012 evening got today on Feb. 16,2012. Came package neat nothing out of place. I WILL very much order again.!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong it works excellently. It is just not as good as another product I have used. It will definitely do what you need. Just not as many uses as I am used to.</li>
    <li> Arrived wrinkled and bent.</li>
    <li> I have tried other transfer papers but this is by far the best. The sellers are gearing their product towards professional artists, not amateurs; in other words they expect you to know what you are doing. The package comes with nothing but the transfer paper. If you are just starting out and don&#x27;t know how to use transfer paper or other supplies, I suggest you go watch some videos on the subject and do some research before making purchases and doling out negative reviews because of your own ignorance. As for the product itself, it is inexpensive, transfers neatly and travels well making it ideal for traveling to tattoo shows. I have used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I personaly like this item, good shipping got here a day before the due date. Stencil works great used it for 3 tribal tats so far an had no problem with them show up great doesnt wipe off as easy as some I&#x27;ve used. Havent tried them on more detaled designs yet but dont think it would be a problem. Will purchase more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with this paper, maybe only that you have to press a little harder then I&#x27;d want for the stencil to take to the paper. Other than that it&#x27;s good paper.</li>
    <li> My brother said these work great. They don&#x27;t separate before you need them to. He liked them</li>
    <li> When buy transfer paper for tattoos make sure that you purchase this or something very similar. Carbon paper does not do it.</li>
    <li> I did recieve this item It did take over a mont to recieve this but havent had the chance to use it.</li>
    <li> it was good paper but there was only 5 in the bag but it was good ill just order some were else next time :(</li>
    <li> Came in earlier then I thought but I don&#x27;t like the way it comes all rolled up</li>
    <li> let me start with the paper is really good paper i was pleased with the quality however the price is a bit high as you can get a whole pack of transfer paper (100sheets) at my local office depo for 8 bucks so 5 bucks for 10 leaflets is a bit high(mine only came with 9) if its expensive to buy in your region i would recommend it but i would check around first.</li>
    <li> This is the worst paper ever at least for making stencils by hand. THe lines are SKIPPY, THIN And totally rub off after a drying time of 15 minutes. I also tried coating with vaseline and it still rubbed off immediately. MA B it was the seller i bought it from in Hong Kong and not the brand?? But I contacted the seller and he never got back to me. Take my advice and if you see this picture of this stencil pack.... RUN  LOL Buy another brand cause this crap sucks!!! Also for newbies dont buy REPRO FX for stencils by hand that paper doesnt work well for hand drawn stencils only a thermal copier. Hope this helps some one!!</li>
    <li> if you need to make a stencil this paper is great, transfers great with green soap, can not go wrong with this paper</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get this to work, I looked up instructions online but still couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  I still have it but have not touched it since I first tried it, sending instructions with it would be a good idea.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t had the chance yet i&#x27;m waiting for the stencil soap but i have faith it will work great i&#x27;m also waiting on idea of tattoos i might like b4 i can proceed</li>
    <li> The tattoo stencil transfer paper in a ten pack works great for transferring designs to the area where the tattoo is to be</li>
    <li> Love The Stencils And Not To Mention The Shipping</li>
    <li> Product is as described. Packaging was a little shabby as some of the transfer paper was wrinkled a bit but all in all&lt;br /&gt;i am happy</li>
    <li> My sheets came in no packaging just taped up plastic. The sheets were dented and bent and some corners were torn. Transfer sheets are important to keep from denting because the dents imprint on the transfer papers.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous for the price,wasnt expecting the quality.you must buy if looking for a good deal.I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Based on the fact that I have never got this I for sure would not buy again. I havent gotten any responds to my emails. Dissapointing to not get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I bought this for real cheap but was a bitch paying for the shipping and handling and all you know, but overall was worth paying for. I say go for it i got exactly what i paid for no joke!</li>
    <li> Yes, it was a cheaper way of getting stencil paper, but it took almost a whole month to receive,and is the worst paper I have ever used for stencils. It doesn&#x27;t stick well, the lines are so light it&#x27;s almost impossible to see them, and it was also short two pieces. I&#x27;d prefer drawing free-handed then rely on this stencil paper. I would recommend NOT buying this.</li>
    <li> Paper did as described. Arrived wrinkle-free, ready to use. Good transfer quality too. It stood up to the green soap, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this..&lt;br /&gt;LRE II</li>
    <li> it is easy to use with the carbon paper like backing /..no need for hectograph pencils with this at all</li>
    <li> Cheap but easy to use and I&#x27;ve found that the trick to this paper is press a little harder. Thank you!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re fine for practicing stenciling but would not recommend as an actual skin transference. The ink doesn&#x27;t grab well no matter how much pressure you apply, I&#x27;ve definitely used better but as an apprentice this was the right price for me to practice. A good stencil is a good start to any tattoo, but you wont get it with these.</li>
    <li> They work perfect. I bought them as part of a gift package for a friend who was just starting out as a tatto artist. It it took a little bit of time to get here, but they did come from China. So no complaints</li>
    <li> I use this for Henna tattoos, but have found other uses for it (painting a mural on my son&#x27;s wall)  works great and reasonable</li>
    <li> It was extremely difficult to get this paper to transfer onto the paper. Once I did get the design I wanted on the paper, it did stay on the skin well though. Also, delivery took almost 3 weeks. I didn&#x27;t receive 10 sheets, I only received 5. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This took the full time to get here and the package was shipped in an envelope but no scratches so far.</li>
    <li> Does not work piece of crap</li>
    <li> Needed last minute fast ship transfer sheet better with printer</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Works great! Stays on skin like it should. I&#x27;ll buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described. Best price on the internet. The quality of the product would be hard to beat.</li>
    <li> This is the best transfer paper I have used for my tattooing. It stays on the skin great after whipping it with green soap and water. Don&#x27;t think ill buy any other kind again.</li>
    <li> Very good qaulity. I use it for doing tattoos and it&#x27;s great. It also showed up in my mail box a lot faster then I expected.. Probably about 3 weeks from the day I placed the order, which is FAST compared to anything I have ever ordered from Amazon. Thank you! I will order again soon :)</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and works great! A great choice for stencil paper.</li>
    <li> i bought this for someone else so i am unsure how to really rate this. that is why its ok</li>
    <li> I liked how many came in the pack and the size of the papers, I&#x27;m just not a big fan of my art being flipped backwards during the stick-n-press process. Anything with words has to be drawn onto the stencil backwards, or I have to change shadowing on the pictures and what-not. But that would be with any stencil paper. Other than that, it&#x27;s a recommended buy.</li>
    <li> Its just transfer paper. It does everything it suppose to do. I have no complaints, good price as well. :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from Hong Kong, since I live in America its taken quite a while to get here.</li>
    <li> Awesome , fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This transfer paper did not work no matter how many ways we tried it. Watched YouTube videos on the application process but the design did not transfer to the skin.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine. My only complaint would be that the paper is folded in half which is not a huge deal but it does put a permanent crease in the paper which does cause a little confusion when trying to sketch out a large tattoo design. That is the reason why I rated the product 4 stars. On another note, this product has no tracking information, so you never really know when it will arrive, which was a big let down. (This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon that has had this problem.) I will say though that when I contacted the seller about the issue and informed them of the 30 day Amazon rule, (basically if you do not receive your item (s) with in 30 days of your purchase you can file a refund claim) they replied with in a day or 2 apologizing for the inconvenience of not having tracking information and the extremely lengthy delivery time (which was 30 days exactly before I received it). I don&#x27;t want to completely dismiss the seller as it&#x27;s obvious that they are trying to do right. I think they just need to start using a different carrier and have tracking updates available. If I were to rate the seller&#x27;s customer satisfactory rate, I would give them 3/5 stars for trying. So, with all of this being said, if you are willing to wait for a month for delivery and don&#x27;t mind not being able to track your package and receiving the product with a crease down the middle of the paper, then by all means this is a good deal. If you can not deal with those obstacles then I would suggest finding a different seller.</li>
    <li> The packs took about a month to get here. It was hard for the image to transfer and no matter what I tried, nothing would transfer to skin, even using Stencil Magic. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Thanks for having it arrive right away and its good for transferring tattoos onto skin</li>
    <li> Paper does what&#x27;s it supposed to ink tranfets fine works good teats smooth every thing was as expected good buy</li>
    <li> I never received the transfer paper yet. I had to rate it above but not sure how it works its been about 6 weeks now and still nothing  very disappointed  and I was charged for it</li>
    <li> Works good and does what its meant for</li>
    <li> Not the best but the stencils transfer for the most part. Gets the job done and is a fair price.</li>
    <li> i get a lot of uses out of it..i love using this product and am able to use for more than one stencil</li>
    <li> This was not the highest quality paper. It takes a lot of pressure to transfer by hand. The stencil does stay on good though.</li>
    <li> this is some good transfer paper,i&#x27;m buying some more of this paper and hope,its the same paper,because it&#x27;s some of the best paper out there.i rather have that instead of the knock off spirit stencil paper.BUT LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADDVICE DON&#x27;NT ORDER FROM NCED Liquidation CO BECAUSE YOU WANT NEVER GET YOU STUFF,I ORDERED THE PAPER FROM THERE ,FOR WHAT REASON AT THE TIME,AND IT WAS THE WORST SCREW UP I&#x27;VE MADE IN YRS.I ORDERED IT JAN. 26 AND STILL CAN&#x27;NT TRACK IT,IT&#x27;S COMING FROM HONG KONG.I SUOULD HAD ORDERED IT FROM A USA CO. THAT STOCKS IT,BUT IT WAS A REASON AT THE TIME I HAD TO ORDER IT FROM THESE PEOPLE,BUT YOU LEARN BY YOUR MISTAKES. THIS IS SOME GOOD STENCIL PAPER IF I EVERY GET IT,AND I&#x27;M GLAD I HAD ALOT OF PAPER STOCKED UP,OR I WOULD BE IN A BAD TIME. CRAZY RICK&lt;br /&gt;HERE IT IS ,FEB17 AND I ORDERED IT JAN 26, AND STILL WAITING, IT BEEN AROUND 24 DAYS NOW, NO STENCIL PAPER,PEOPLE DON&#x27;NT ORDER NOTHING FROM THIS CO. NCED LIQUIDATION,BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT GET YOUR STUFF,ORDER FROM A SELLER THAS GOT IT IN STOCK.</li>
