      <li>you!&lt;br /&gt;Product: love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love it -</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>Five stars for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Vendor: great price, fast delivery, thank</li>
      <li>Not my favorite serums, by the way.</li>
      <li>Does what it says and more.</li>
      <li>I just love it, love it, love it.</li>
      <li>but I received this yesterday and promptly washed my face to try it on a bit to make sure it didn&#x27;t bother my skin before going to bed with it on.</li>
      <li>I have acne scars and sun damage, and my skin looks better now than when I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I found  better products (for my skin) at Ulta and Sephora.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My skin always looks better in the morning when I remember to put it on before bed.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>It is an outstanding product that helps your face feel tighter and smoother.</li>
      <li>Skin was smoother, brighter, more even-toned.</li>
      <li>I love using it before my moisturizers.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife and we BOTH love the results.</li>
      <li>My skintone is more even and smooth since using this product.</li>
      <li>I probably sound like I&#x27;m an infomercial for Avon, but I just cannot tell you how glad I am</li>
      <li>My skin is noticeably smoother, pores tighter, just overall looks beautiful.</li>
      <li>The seller has great customer service too.&lt;br /&gt;Other things that work similarly are DDF 10% Glycolic Moisturizing Exfoliator ROC Retinol Day</li>
      <li>It does smooth out the complexion.</li>
      <li>Light and absorbent.</li>
      <li>I have also be using this product along with the Avon Anew clinical Advanced retexturizing peel with glycolic acid</li>
      <li>Did not realize my skin was so sensitive, but would not recommend this product to anyone with fair skin.</li>
      <li>I hope it only gets better with continued use!!</li>
      <li>I love this, it really helps smooth out skin, shrinks pores,</li>
      <li>It felt smooth from the very first use and has ever since.</li>
      <li>But after just a couple of days I saw my LARGE pores disappear on my chin and nose---I just ordered more cause</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
      <li>I have switched to a much cheaper alpha hydroxy cream and it has made a much more drastic difference in my skin in comparison.</li>
      <li>This is great for getting rid of dark spots caused by acne.  </li>
      <li>so anything less is a great price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fast and easy way to take care of myself.</li>
      <li>I purchase this from avon book put it on at night and in the morning skin was very soft , love It</li>
      <li>Definitely will purchase more when mine runs out!</li>
      <li>Plus I love the smell of this fluid, and how easily it goes into your skin.  </li>
      <li>but I really like the way it feels on my skin and how it seems to help keep my skin smooth.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price people.</li>
      <li>If you can get this stuff at below what AVON sells it for, it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
      <li>and I have been seeing an improvement of shrinking my very large pores on&lt;br /&gt;my cheeks and forehead.</li>
      <li>I have used up the whole bottle and the design is really cool, but altogether no change to my skin.</li>
      <li>Great product, it actually make a facial scar go away!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: I thought this was working well at first...</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>The acne scars I had are smoothing out and fading with consistent use of this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it and report more later.</li>
      <li>Actually like the exfoliating pads that avon sells better.</li>
      <li>First review:</li>
      <li>This burned my skin with the first application.  </li>
      <li>Wow, I love the way my 50 year old skin feels when I use the resurfacing serum.</li>
      <li>But my dry skin did feel like it needed more moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Felt nice, slight tightening and no irritation.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have large pores</li>
      <li>If you have large pores on your nose or chin</li>
      <li>Well, this product really has nothing for me that I can see.</li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
      <li>use this daily under my lotion, along with the Avon ANEW CLINICAL Advanced Retexturizing Peel twice a week, and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use it for two days and it was very noticeable</li>
      <li>As described, arrived fast.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper to buy on Amazon.</li>
      <li>but but don&#x27;t really see any improvement.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S VERY DRYING ,CANT</li>
      <li>I bought this face product and it works really well.</li>
      <li>Good to use at least once a week.</li>
      <li>For reference- my skin type is oily, with very large pores on my cheeks right next to my nose.</li>
      <li>I have huge pores and this makes them disappear (as long as I keep it up).</li>
      <li>The first time I used it in the day time then saw on the box that it makes your skin sun sensitive so from now</li>
      <li>OK I know this might seem odd</li>
      <li>I feel like I might be able to walk around with less make up on and not feel like I have to always have something nearby  to cover up blemishes as the day goes</li>
      <li>so I have a decent amount of discoloration and</li>
      <li>I am surprised at the positive reviews of this product.</li>
      <li>This product works as well as the high end products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love it. i notice that my skin looks youthful. I don&#x27;t have large pores</li>
    <li> I saw results within a week. Skin was smoother, brighter, more even-toned. Pores seemed smaller. Did not breakout my sensitive skin. But my dry skin did feel like it needed more moisturizer. One star off because it must be used religiously. I didn&#x27;t use it for two days and it was very noticeable</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but but don&#x27;t really see any improvement. Actually like the exfoliating pads that avon sells better. Will not purchase this again</li>
    <li> I cannot praise this product highly enough. For about 3 years I have suffered from dreadful spots and they weren&#x27;t budging despite antibiotics, benzyl peroxide and a great combination of clearskin products and a vast amount of face scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this originally to try and help with some of the acne scars I have on my face, and it has actually managed to remove all of my scars, even the deep dents. It has also managed to clear up the remaining spots on my face and it&#x27;s clearer than it has been for years. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> Great product, use it sparingly.  still have a little left</li>
    <li> I actually have only used this for a short time but I really like the way it feels on my skin and how it seems to help keep my skin smooth.  I used it to repleace the anew glycolic acid fluid (don&#x27;t remember the name).  This one I am very happy with and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is great for getting rid of dark spots caused by acne.  I have used this on my face AND my back, and it works really well.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I named my review finally because I have tried EVERY serum on this planet, and none have given me the results Avon Smoothing Fluid has in only 3 days of use..I only gave it 4 stars cause the smell is a little perfumie (sp), but who cares! My skin is noticeably smoother, pores tighter, just overall looks beautiful. I have acne scars and sun damage, and my skin looks better now than when I was in my 20&#x27;s. I hope it only gets better with continued use!! I hope everyone benefits from this great product as well, good luck!!</li>
    <li> I use this after showering before my skin is completely dry. It goes on smoothly (a little goes a long way) and keeps my skin smooth and youthful looking.</li>
    <li> This works really good on my skin. I break out frequently and have noticed that while using it regularly my breakouts are limited.</li>
    <li> I love this, it really helps smooth out skin, shrinks pores, even skin tone etc! Love it - I will always use this product! Great price as well</li>
    <li> ...then I would recommend it.  I don&#x27;t have any major skin problems, I&#x27;m just in my early 30&#x27;s and trying to look a little less \\&quot;tired\\&quot;.  It definitely makes my skin feel softer and I think it has improved the overall look of my skin.  I have noticed a tiny bit of peeling, but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s just the product doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The peeling isn&#x27;t an issue at all...I just use a little more moisturizer and you can&#x27;t even tell.  If you can get this stuff at below what AVON sells it for, it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
    <li> As described, arrived fast. I love this product and my face seems smoother! Definitely will purchase more when mine runs out!</li>
    <li> If you have large pores on your nose or chin this is the product for you!!  I was completely blown away!  And even more-so because the product is by AVON!!  But after just a couple of days I saw my LARGE pores disappear on my chin and nose---I just ordered more cause I swear every time you find a product that works it gets discontinued!  This one is a keeper for sure!</li>
    <li> I use this product faithfully and it does make a difference. It is an outstanding product that helps your face feel tighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> I purchase this from avon book put it on at night and in the morning skin was very soft , love It</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle!</li>
    <li> I use it several time a week. I like the results and it does not take but a few drops per use.</li>
    <li> It has a very pleasant fresh smell to it which I love, however i didn&#x27;t see any changes to my skin of any sort. during my process of using it. I have used up the whole bottle and the design is really cool, but altogether no change to my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and we BOTH love the results. This stuff really works! Well worth the price people.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews that said it helped with facial scars because I have late onset type acne that has left scars on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a month along with  Avon Anew Rejuvenate Revitalizing 2-in-1 Gel Cleanser, and  Avon Anew Clinical Derma-Full Facial Filling Cream and I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne scars have gotten lighter....will be getting more!!</li>
    <li> Serum did not make my face smoother like other customers described. I did not see any difference after using it for 3 months. I would not continue to buy this serum.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s bad, just wasn&#x27;t effective on my skin.</li>
    <li> This was not at all what I expected.  Used 1/2 the bottle and saw no change so I ended up throwing it away.  Very disappointing for an Avon product.</li>
    <li> A can&#x27;t do without product!</li>
    <li> Sorry Avon, this didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Delivery was great! I have used this product for about a week now, so far I have seen no results as talked about, but hopefully I can update later after further use.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a week not and I have been seeing an improvement of shrinking my very large pores on&lt;br /&gt;my cheeks and forehead. I have also be using this product along with the Avon Anew clinical Advanced retexturizing peel with glycolic acid&lt;br /&gt;pads.</li>
    <li> I have used Lancome, Dior, Este Lauder and for the price, this is amazing.  I have huge pores and this makes them disappear (as long as I keep it up). I can&#x27;t believe what I got for the price!</li>
    <li> Five stars for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Vendor: great price, fast delivery, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Product: love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily under my lotion, along with the Avon ANEW CLINICAL Advanced Retexturizing Peel twice a week, and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my skin. It&#x27;s a fast and easy way to take care of myself.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. ....been using it twice a day for almost a year. For me it has an immediate effect and tightens things up.  I love using it before my moisturizers. Over all my fine lines..creases and wrinkles are less deep &amp; noticeable.  Its $39.99 through avon so anything less is a great price.  I will use it as long as I can buy it!</li>
    <li> This burned my skin with the first application.  Did not realize my skin was so sensitive, but would not recommend this product to anyone with fair skin.</li>
    <li> I think I got an old bottle - it was too thick and gloppy for the applicator</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 yrs.It is a great product for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no luck with Avon products.  No change in my skin whatsoever.  I found  better products (for my skin) at Ulta and Sephora. Neither store carries both products that work for me. One successfully removes the dead skin cells (Sephora) and the other works at the cellular level (Ulta), both are expensive though.</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, so only plastic surgery would deliver major results. It does smooth out the complexion.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, price and service. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used this product once and didn&#x27;t experience any burning feeling. It tingled for a few seconds, but then the tingling went away. What didn&#x27;t go away was a &amp;#34;red mask&amp;#34; everywhere the product touched my skin. I looked like I have a sunburn that stayed for more than a week now. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Like putting water on your face.  Don&#x27;t bother. Did absolutely nothing for me.  Literally, you put it on and it dries like water and that&#x27;s the end of it.  Nice packaging though and that goes a long way.  But the product inside sucks.</li>
    <li> awesome, I love it and keep ordering!</li>
    <li> Bottle came EMPTY. Total rip off.... And of course, it&#x27;s well past the purchase date that I discovered this... Complete and absolute thievery.</li>
    <li> First review: I have used this twice and have had no irritation or bad reaction. I put it on dry clean skin and it seemed to dry fast and feel tight on my skin like some serums do. Not my favorite serums, by the way. I waited a bit then put on my usual moisturizer.  The first time I used it in the day time then saw on the box that it makes your skin sun sensitive so from now on I&#x27;ll use it at night only. The second time I used it, it didn&#x27;t seem to feel as tight (and who knows why on that one). I&#x27;ll continue to use nightly and see if I can see any results. I have to mention that I don&#x27;t have problem skin - only 76 year old skin - never had acne, no scars, not wrinkled except for lines around my mouth and underneath where the sagging has occurred.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and report more later. A FEW DAYS LATER: It no longer feels dry and tight when I put it on clean dry skin. It feels nice. Since I&#x27;ve been using this smoothing fluid along with the Eraser cream I can&#x27;t really tell which one is making the difference but I can definitely see a difference in less than a week. The pores seem smaller and my skin is tighter and has a sort of glow that it didn&#x27;t have before. I&#x27;m going to keep using and monitoring and see what happens. I think it is probably this smoothing fluid that is responsible for the improvement in my skin.Final Review: After about 3 weeks I feel like this is drying my skin and it looks duller to me. I&#x27;m going to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Well, this product really has nothing for me that I can see. Skin seems to be in same condition as when I started using it. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at the positive reviews of this product. I have been using it a month and have seen no changes whatsoever to my skin. None. Nada, zip.</li>
    <li> My skintone is more even and smooth since using this product. The acne scars I had are smoothing out and fading with consistent use of this product. I&#x27;ve purchased another bottle and I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use my skin will attain the eveness I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT IT DOES. IT&#x27;S VERY DRYING ,CANT SAY I LJKE THE FEEL OF IT ON MY SKIN.</li>
    <li> I saw rave reviews on this serum online in a message board &amp; had to try it.  It is far less expensive on amazon than it is through Avon.  ($39.99 at Avon, &amp; it varies from about $10-$20 here).  I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a week &amp; OMG I see a drastic difference in my acne scars.  It makes your skin smoother &amp; clearer.  I use it morning &amp; night.  I have had acne scars for YEARS &amp; they are much lighter after only a week.  I never want to be without it again!  :)</li>
    <li> OK I know this might seem odd but I received this yesterday and promptly washed my face to try it on a bit to make sure it didn&#x27;t bother my skin before going to bed with it on. Felt nice, slight tightening and no irritation. So when I went to bed I washed up, dried, and applied to the entire face. It might be psychological but I swear when I woke this morning I already saw an improvement! I have oily acne prone skin and it has really increased lately. I have struggled with it throughout my life and I have olive complected skin which scars very easily so I have a decent amount of discoloration and such to say the least. A couple of recent spots are drying up and already fading! I hope the changes I saw over night continue. I feel like I might be able to walk around with less make up on and not feel like I have to always have something nearby  to cover up blemishes as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I thought this was working well at first...after continued use till the bottle was about gone I really saw not much improvement in my skin. I have switched to a much cheaper alpha hydroxy cream and it has made a much more drastic difference in my skin in comparison. This stuff might work for some and while it isn&#x27;t a terrible product I am not going to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Great product, it actually make a facial scar go away!</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this</li>
    <li> It seems to work great. My skin looks more even but have only had a few weeks. My Sis came to visit and she likes the serum and is going to get some.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin tone very smooth and even and the redness has been greatly reduced. Love it. Will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love the way my 50 year old skin feels when I use the resurfacing serum. It felt smooth from the very first use and has ever since.</li>
    <li> A good clarifier to use at night.  May sting a little but that decreases.  Good to use at least once a week.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  Seriously.  I have never used Avon products until recently, and I have been on a constant prowl for a &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; that would reduce the appearance of my hideously large pores on my cheeks/nose.  I use this smoothing fluid (after first using the Resurfacing Texturizing Pads that Avon sells, I can&#x27;t remember the exact name of it) and after only 3 DAYS, I noticed a huuuuge improvement in the appearance of my pores.  I have been telling all of my friends about it, and my mom ordered the product after she saw my face.  Seriously, if you have huge pores, try this.  Ordering from an Avon catalog is much more expensive than ordering via Amazon, I have found.  Plus I love the smell of this fluid, and how easily it goes into your skin.  Just an amazing product!  I probably sound like I&#x27;m an infomercial for Avon, but I just cannot tell you how glad I am I found this product.  For reference- my skin type is oily, with very large pores on my cheeks right next to my nose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and my skin is SO improved!!  And I haven&#x27;t even used half the bottle!!</li>
    <li> I bought this face product and it works really well. I have been using it for about a month. It does tingle parts of my face but the tingling goes away after a few seconds. Much cheaper to buy on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just love it, love it, love it. Does what it says and more. A must have ladies!!!!!</li>
    <li> In less than a week my complexion changed.  My skin appears younger, brighter, and with smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;My age spots have started to fade also.  This product works as well as the high end products.</li>
    <li> Light and absorbent. My skin always looks better in the morning when I remember to put it on before bed.  Also helps with acne.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the Anew Retexturizing Peel (in the morning).  I use the Fluid at night.  After less than a week I rec&#x27;d compliments on my complexion.  It glowed!</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff in hopes of evening out my skin tone.  I have only been using it for 3 days now and it&lt;br /&gt;actually is working. It exfoliates from the underneath to the surface.  It&#x27;s healing my minor blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I paid $15 for this stuff and it works like the $60 stuff.  The seller has great customer service too.&lt;br /&gt;Other things that work similarly are DDF 10% Glycolic Moisturizing Exfoliator ROC Retinol Day Moisturizer w/spf 30&lt;br /&gt;and Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle repair.  The stuff that is supposed to fight wrinkles is a little stronger than the stuff that&lt;br /&gt;is only to even your skin tone in my experience.</li>
    <li> I too am surprised at the excellent ratings for this product as I have not noticed any difference, not even tingling.  However, I have been using another Avon Retexurizing product on the nights not using this one and am very happy with that one.  I thought that using each every other night would be the thing to do but I don&#x27;t know.  Another reviewer had used the two together which made my decision to buy both products.  I can&#x27;t tell if this one has made a difference.  I can&#x27;t FEEL anything so perhaps that has lessened my impression of this product.</li>
