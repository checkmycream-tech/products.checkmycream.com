      <li>Soft &amp; Give flawless finish</li>
      <li>if that hadn&#x27;t happened, I would easily give 5 stars and would order a set for myself!</li>
      <li>Also use it to lightly contour or highlight my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there are plenty of good cheap brush sets here on Amazon and this set isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>

      <li>The eyeshadow brushes are great for blending out harsh lines, and the pointed precise one is great for adding color into your crease.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that the size of the brushes fit in my make up bag.</li>

      <li>I really like these type of brushes that I can use each brush for so many uses.</li>
      <li>Really great quality brushes, the only problem was when I first unpackaged them it just smelled like fresh glue.</li>
      <li>The angled face brush is perfect for a subtle contour.</li>
      <li>Arrived Quick and just as described...</li>
      <li>I used a bit more foundation than I normally would</li>
      <li>My foundation routine is now my favorite part of getting ready thanks to these!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Softest professional brushes for such an affordable price! I replaced my E.L.F brushes</li>
    <li> Soft &amp; Give flawless finish</li>
    <li> Work REALLY good. I&#x27;ve noticed that I can feel the brushes getting loose but I just screwed them back into the silver handle and pushed down hard and they stopped feeling loose. GREAT buy for the money!</li>
    <li> First thing I have to say is Wow!! Amazing brushes for a very good price, I bought 2 sets one for me and one for my sister. I&#x27;m planing on ordering another set for my freelance makeup kit, that&#x27;s how much I like them...another thing I would like to mention is that I received them soooo fast , I ordered them on Saturday evening and they were delivered Monday morning like early morning, which is even better...(I hate waiting) anyway I do recommend these brushes they are awesome for anyone who loves makeup!!!!!</li>
    <li> Decent set of brushes. One did become detached from black handle. I just glued the metal part back onto the black handle.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes! Super soft and good quality</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE MOST PERFECT DUPE FOR SIGMA BRUSHES. My foundation routine is now my favorite part of getting ready thanks to these!</li>
    <li> Super soft. Well crafted. So many brushes for different things. Perfect value.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes just as good as more expensive brushes</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I received these in the mail yesterday but upon initial inspection there were two brushes that had loose ferrules. I didn&#x27;t think much of it and decided to give them a wash before I used them. The large round top kabuki brush couldn&#x27;t even withstand a wash before coming undone at the ferrule. I&#x27;ve had some ELF brushes from the $1 line for years and I&#x27;ve never had any of them even get loose. This was not a very good first impression.</li>
    <li> Nice effective and manageable brushes</li>
    <li> Love these they are so freakn soft. Not as dense as sigma F80 but damn is so close too it. It had a weird smell but after 2 washing smell went away. I find myself reaching for my bestope flat</li>
    <li> Love my brushes great quality!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes for the price</li>
    <li> I got this set spacificaly to improve the way my foundation is applied...i am so glad i picked this set its almost perfect!! All the bug brushed are deffinitly worth the buy. The small brushes arnt very usful to me they are just flimsy but i really just wanted one or two foundation brushes and the big brushes are definitly worth the buy! They are very fluffy and soft and super easy to clean</li>
    <li> Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)</li>
    <li> Great brushes!! It made a great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I did not expect to receive such good quality brushes at this price! They are easily comparable to my Sigma brushes- which in my opinion, is a better quality than the brushes sold by Mac. I have used the kabuki and the eye shadow brushes, washed and dried them twice over since receiving the package in the mail, and other than 1-2 hairs on the stippling brush, none of them have shed. They feel good in the hand and not cheap and flimsy, and the density of the hair is almost as thick and cushiony as the Sigma brushes. Most importantly, I&#x27;ve noticed that the results are the same as my F80- which means that I can travel with this set and leave my precious Sigma set safely at home, knowing I&#x27;ll get results just as good at not even a quarter of it&#x27;s price!    The brushes arrived in 2 days, individually protected and in a pink zippered cover.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast! They look great but the hairs on the brush are not of great quality. Still love the brush set!</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I first got them. But after around 2 weeks of having them a brush head literally slipped off. Then another one broke and then I contacted them and they said they&#x27;ll do something if by the end of this time frame they gave me and another one broke. And when I contacted them when yet another one broke they never replied back. It&#x27;s been months. Yes, they&#x27;re affordable brushes, but I would like to spend my money and have all of the brushes in one piece.</li>
    <li> I read a review which compared these to Sigma brushes and decided to try them. I received my order quickly, with Prime, and just used them for the first time today. I am impressed. Yes there was a chemical smell when they were opened, but a good washing and air dry took care of that. They flat kabuki blended foundation beautifully but I do suggest playing around a bit with your proportions. I used a bit more foundation than I normally would but then I realized I had am excessive amount on. There is no product stealing here, just my unfamiliarity with the brushes. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes! The bristles are soft and the setting is strong - the bristles do not shed.  These are great brushes and I love the way they hold the powder and creates a very smooth look after I apply my makeup.</li>
    <li> Got this for a Christmas gift for my sister. She loves them! Although they do smell a little weird coming out of the bag, the smell went away when she washed them the first time and had them sit out over night. Great quality for the price and I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this brush set!!! I ordered 2 more for my collection and my friends are always asking me about what brushes I use because they love the way my make up looks!!! Shipping was super and very fast!!!</li>
    <li> I just recived my bestope brushes in the mail and i have to say they are Amazing!! The best i have boight for such a feeat price</li>
    <li> The brushes are beautiful and look expensive. I like the size and I got them super fast with my prime shipping! I haven&#x27;t used product on them yet, but first impressions they are nice. the one thing that prevents me from making this 5 star is the smell. the smell is quite strange. its like chemical plastic or something. I am letting them air out and it is someone dissipating, but man the smell.....yikes! otherwise they are great for the price and I would recommend them, and I think I might buy a second set.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my sister for Christmas. They came beautifully packaged and shipped on time. Super soft brushes. But 2 of the brushes came apart as I was inspecting them. :/ if that hadn&#x27;t happened, I would easily give 5 stars and would order a set for myself!</li>
    <li> as expected quality for the price. Good, haven&#x27;t had any issues yet.</li>
    <li> I just love this bushes.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;Every just as discribed ! Xoxo</li>
    <li> Got them in time, they are super soft and great quality! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AH-MAZING! I received my order quickly, and am very pleased. As some stated, these brushes do have an odor. To me they smell like a dry erase marker. After they&#x27;ve been washed and left out for a bit the smell goes away. They are so dense, and the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt. I&#x27;d say they feel similar to Real Technique brushes, and are softer than Eco Tools brushes. I didn&#x27;t have any shedding as some stated. Maybe they fixed the problem? The handles are extremely sturdy, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I actually ordered another set as a backup, and am waiting for them to arrive. You wont be disappointed with these.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes. I love the eyeshadow brushes as well as the blush/bronzer brush. The powder brush is a tad small in my opinion. Overall really great brushes for the price. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I ordered silver/black but I received gold/black instead.  Except for the incorrect color the brushes are great!!</li>
    <li> My brush hair fell out of some of them. So it kind of ruined my experience for the ones that worked.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing for the price! These are the 2nd set of brushes that I purchased for myself. I like it much better than the ones I had in the past. I really like these type of brushes that I can use each brush for so many uses. If I am running late and i need a brush with me for retouching my make up. I just get whichever on the face brushes and I am good to go! I&#x27;m glad that the size of the brushes fit in my make up bag. It&#x27;s really good for travel. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and with the service!</li>
    <li> These brushes are such a great bang for your buck. They are incredibly soft and durable. The eyeshadow brushes are great for blending out harsh lines, and the pointed precise one is great for adding color into your crease. I use the tapered face brush for applying undereye powder, it&#x27;s perfect for the under eye area. The angled face brush is perfect for a subtle contour. Highly recommend these brushes to anyone looking to add in some great brushes to their kit.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
    <li> Great deal Very good quality.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Came quickly in good packaging. Had an awful smell right out of the packaging. Smell is slightly still there even after a month of owning this set and washing it multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is I&#x27;ve had absolutely no shedding. I also like the look of the brushes. The handle is a matte black and the size of it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever use the face brushes. I was looking for an alternative way to apply foundation outside of using the Beauty Blender but this isn&#x27;t it. It makes my foundation feel heavier than the BB does. And it leaves the horrible smell it comes with on my face. Because the brushes are so dense, you have to really make sure you let it dry out in the open, not in some corner, or you&#x27;ll give it an even nastier smell. I also tried finding other uses for it and failed. I used the pointy one to apply a highlighter above my cheekbones and it ended up being a massive chuck of shimmer. And it picked up my foundation and blush back onto the brush &amp;#62;:l&lt;br /&gt;I do use the eye brushes for blending though. They&#x27;re too big to use to place the shadows onto my eyes but work well to blend. Also use it to lightly contour or highlight my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there are plenty of good cheap brush sets here on Amazon and this set isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> Some of the bristles are coming out but thats just on one of the brushes. And they did smell alittle even after washing them. But they are great i love using them</li>
    <li> Really great quality brushes, the only problem was when I first unpackaged them it just smelled like fresh glue.</li>
    <li> Very happy I ordered these. I was nervous ordering these as I have had bad luck in the past but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. These definitely  had a chemical smell when they arrived but after washed they were fine. They aren&#x27;t the most sturdy brushes I&#x27;ve ever used but definitely not the worst. I&#x27;m super happy with my brushes! For the price you can&#x27;t beat them!</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes loved them work well very upset when the handle came off but I&#x27;m still using them.for what you pay does it job.</li>
    <li> First thing I noticed about these brushes is that they smelt like chemicals from a factory (like many have pointed out in previous reviews); however, I give them 5 stars because of how comfortable they are when I glide the bristles against my face. I completely agree with the many reviewers who have said that they are very soft brushes. They don&#x27;t irritate my skin like my ELF powder brush does - nope, they make my face feel happy (if that makes sense)! And I am very glad I made this purchase. They were a great price for their quality as well! They do shed a little and take a long time to clean, but I still really like these brushes! :) Thanks, Bestope!</li>
    <li> Ok I RELLY wanted to like these brushes they had an odor I went to clean them (I&#x27;m a professional MUA yes I do know how to clean brushes) well the bristles completely came out of one of the blending brushes!! I checked the others they are securely attached and didn&#x27;t even shedd during the wash (big plus) so I will probably keep them for the other brushes</li>
    <li> Very good set of brushes. I recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> The quality of the bristles are soft, and I haven&#x27;t had much issues with the bristles falling out.  However the overall quality of the brushes are only OK.  The handles tend to come apart after a couple of uses - a couple of the smaller brushes, the handles came apart right out of the package. I had to glued them back with a hot glue gun and it&#x27;s been okay so far.</li>
    <li> Brushes came nicely packaged. They are sturdy and have super soft bristles. They do a nice job blending foundation and eyeshaddow. Haven&#x27;t tried to clean them yet, but overall I am really happy with them and love the price. Glad I didn&#x27;t drop a small fortune on sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> Very good, very soft, the smell is the only bad thing, but eventually it goes away</li>
    <li> I wish i had known about these during makeup school.I live in india and vega is a known brand here..and their brushes were so horrible..everyone had breakouts nd their skin would get irritated..My curiosity led me to discover brands like sigma and real techniques tom ford etc...now ive not owned any of those big brands but I saw the reviews on these sigma dupes and got them..I am sooooooo glad i got these..Yes they do have a strong smell but once u use them nd air them out it fades away..I havent had any shedding..the bristles r so so soft and the finish of my makeup is just flawless..Alot of big companies get their logos printed nd sell for 4 -5 times the price..id rather get the exact same thing for less nd with no branding...These babies are absolutely worth it..:)</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for the price. They came to me on time and they were perfect and I love them so far. I haven&#x27;t used them but I can tell they will work good. I recommend these to people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but want good value. I am very happy with my decision.</li>
    <li> Seriously waste of my money. Only the Contour and angled brush are decent. The smaller brushes do not pick up any of the colors and it&#x27;s now sitting in my bathroom forever alone.</li>
    <li> I have always bought the expensive brushes from Bare Minerals.  I decided to replace the brushes and thought this was a great price.  What could I lose, because these were a great price.  You can&#x27;t even buy one brush from Bare Minerals for what I purchased this whole set for.  To my surprise, these brushes are great, and they are the same quality as the Bare Minerals brushes.  I read many of the reviews, and some mentioned a funny smell.  My set of brushes didn&#x27;t smell at all.  LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a week now and I love them, they really pick up product, good coverage,  and i haven&#x27;t had any shedding....</li>
