<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have gone to a dermatologist for many years, and this is the one face wash she recommended that truly doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, nor make it feel tight after washing. In addition, it has been a God-send in the treatment of the cystic acne that used to form on my chin. I get this as a Subscribe and Save item through Amazon, not just for the small discount, but because I don&#x27;t want to be a day without it.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice cleanser; doesnt leave your face feeling dry or tight.  Would probably order again.  Price is pretty good too.</li>
    <li> This facewash is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see a huge different from my other facewash.&lt;br /&gt;I been using it for several months and about to finish my 2nd bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll continue to use it. I might getting back to neutrogena grapefruit just because it&#x27;s more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;If this product would cost the same I might been sticking to it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I am  66 years old and my face still breaks out all the time, usually from some product which sets it off.  This product is wonderful.  I have been breakout free ever since I have been using it.  It is gentle yet keeps those excess cells off of the skin surface.  It is not drying at all.  It is very well priced for a glycolic acid cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. The T-zone is pro acne. I used a lot of products in my life, they were generally absorbed then. But a change happened in my mature years which made it hard for me in the choice of my cosmetics.I spent quite some money on hydrogene peroxide and salycilic acid based . These left my skin extremely dry, but I had to use them because my skin broke out at many moisturizers. Fortunately,in my reading I discovered about glycolic acid (found in grapes) products which helped to balance pH acidity in the skin.   I found Amazon advertisement about Aqua Glycolic Cleanser. I tried it together with the Facial Cream. I put a sunscreen on top. My skin is now smooth and refined. Its comfortable texture lasts all day.  Combination skin is a big nuisance. Why don&#x27;t you try Aqua Glycolic Cleaser as a first step to solve this prblem?</li>
    <li> First time I used the cleanser, toner, and cream; I got a rash and bumps on my neck. Be careful if you have sensitive skin. Just discovered after using this product that I&#x27;m allergic to the alpha-hydroxy...eeeks!</li>
    <li> Aqua Glycolic is usually kept behind the Pharmacy counter. The Cleanser is used as a base for some dermatology formulations due to its 12% glycolic acid concentration. Aqua Glycolic cleanser unclogs pores, stimulates cell turnover, smoothes and softens skin. My dermatologist told me to use this cleanser in the treatment of my adult acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation to be followed by prescription creams for morning(Hydroquinone) and bedtime (Retin-A).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I have not used any other products in the Aqua Glycolic regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This cleanser may sting your skin! If your skin is sensitive only use it at bedtime until your skin adjusts(about a week). Then use it morning and night. Follow the Aqua Glycolic directions EXACTLY - apply it to DRY skin for maximum effectiveness. Be sure to use sunscreen because your new skin is sun-sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came back to Aqua Glycolic because my health insurance no longer reimburses for prescriptions considered cosmetic. As my budget tightens, I cannot afford the $100 per tube for newer treatments like Tri-luma Cream (glycolic acid, hydroquinone, Retin-A) or Medi-Spa appointments for facials and monthly glycolic acid peels. For less than 30 bucks you can have 12 ounces of both a cleanser AND treatment for fine lines, wrinkles and skin discoloration delivered to your door. Ladies, this is way more effective than most things at your department store and more cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua Glycolic Cleanser is highly recommended by my Pharmacist as the best value product for clearer, smoother skin. He said if you can stand it, leave the cleanser on for 5 minutes before adding water and massaging it into your skin before rinsing. He then applies it again after skin dries and lets it dry as a night time treatment. He has clear, smooth and glowing skin even though he shaves. Value at 25 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your order has $25 worth of AMAZON fulfilled products for the free shipping, Aqua Glycolic is cheaper than a local purchase.</li>
    <li> Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Cetyl Alcohol, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Sorbitol, Stearyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in their report \\&quot;Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in the Environment: Agents of Subtle Change?\\&quot; reported that the chemical preservatives called parabens--methyl, propyl, butyl and ethyl (alkyl-p-hydroxybenzoates)--displayed estrogenic activity in several tests. This means that these chemicals mimic your body&#x27;s own hormones and can have endocrine-disrupting action when they are rubbed into your body or washed down the drain into your drinking water. These disruptors interfere with your body&#x27;s endocrine system: your hypothalamus, your ovaries, your thyroid--virtually every system in your body. The EPA also stated that \\&quot;continual introduction of these benzoates (parabens) into sewage treatment systems and directly to recreational waters from the skin leads to the question of risk to aquatic organisms.\\&quot; Scientists in Europe found other endocrine-disrupting body care chemicals in the bodies of fish that humans are eating, and in human breast milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Smith has written that \\&quot;It is a known medical fact that estrogen stimulates breast cancer\\&quot; and that \\&quot;anything absorbed through the skin may be as high as 10 times the concentration of an oral dose.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I grew up with acne prone skin, for years I was testing products, none that would completely satisfy me. Even now that I am older, I am prone to small breakouts here and there. Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser has been a great help to me over the past few years. Not only do I feel like my face is more lush and hydrated, I get far less fewer breakouts than before.    I suggest this product if you are looking for a daily cleanser. Depending on your skin type, this cleanser provides sufficient moisturizing for you. An overall good cleanser.    Tip: Use as directed, it makes a big difference. Also, if you are a male who shaves, this is perfect for shaving! No razor bumps at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have been using this cleanser for 5 years.  It helps with period breakouts, but does not dry out my face.  My husband shaves his face with it because it helps alleviate razor burn.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product is something you cannot find in the aisles of a drugstore.  It is in the pharmacy.  Which means it works &amp; is a good product.  My skin&#x27;s appearance has improved quite a bit with regular use</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is a great cleanser &amp; the price is much cheaper than my local pharmacy.  Arrived promptly as well.</li>
    <li> I saw this in the Kaiser pharmacy and after reading a lot of great reviews on this I decided to purchase it. I had skin problems all throughout my pregnancy and it got even worse afterwards. Needless to say, it left a lot of scarring. I finally got it under control using the Clinique Acne System, but I thought this stuff would be worth a try. I was wrong. I ended up breaking out with huge cyst-like pimples and now have a rash (that looks like curling iron burns) on parts of my face and neck that my doctor says will take about a month to clear. I have naturally oily skin that was controlled with a quick blot every once in a while, but with this it felt like I couldn&#x27;t blot my face enough. I wanted to scratch my face off by the time I got off work. I also didn&#x27;t like how I had to wash my make-up off with a different cleanser, dry my face and then apply the glycolic cleanser. It didn&#x27;t seem to remove all my make-up when used alone. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive and didn&#x27;t sting like the bottle said it could and I&#x27;ve had glycolic acid peels before with no problem. I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong.</li>
    <li> If you have a light completion with freckles, this is by far the best cleanser. (I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.) Great for lighting skin blemishes. However, the manuafacturer needs to do a better job of sealing the bottles. I&#x27;ve ordered this product for years and some of the bottles always leak during shipping.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Seriously. After using it twice a day for a couple of months my sporadic break-outs have practically ceased. Doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin either. I wished something like this had come along when I was a teenager.</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive skin and i have always had a hard time finding shower items. i went to a dermatologist and she recommended this item for facial wash and shaving. you have to ask at the counter. they don&#x27;t have it on the shelves.</li>
    <li> My Doctor recommend this and I had used it years ago.  I could not find it at the drug store any more so I was really glad I could order it.</li>
    <li> I used it they way all the reviewers said to use it. Apply to a dry face and neck 5 min before you get in the shower and after a week or so this 49 year old lady started waking up in the morning and my face felt oily! I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> it did absolutely nothing to my skin</li>
    <li> Just turned 50, been using this for about a year.  Exfoliates, reduces appearance of pores and fine lines, fades sun spots, leaves skin soft and smooth.  So easy to pop on for a minute or 2 before I jump in the shower in the morning. Lots of results for little $$!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that really works as a facial cleanser.  It takes a little bit of effort to remove face makeup with this product, so it would probably be best to use it in addition to a makeup remover.  It doesn&#x27;t burn like some cleansers, and it also doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance to it, so it works well with sensitive skin.  I would definitely recommend this product to any friends who have occasional breakouts, or who would just like to find a good cleanser that is not hard on their skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product twice &amp; I can already tell a difference in my skin. It is drying out the breakouts and smoothing out my forehead. Looking so much better after only two nights. My skin is normally very sensitive to products but I&#x27;ve had no trouble yet. I hope this keeps working for me. I&#x27;m excited about the difference I&#x27;m already seeing.</li>
    <li> I like it, because it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like some other products.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and still leaves skin feeling clean.  It&#x27;s been less than a week so I can&#x27;t really tell if there&#x27;s much improvement, but I do think my skin looks a bit smoother.</li>
    <li> I never had acne as a teen.  But in my early twenties I started to notice the occasional giant zit.  Being a little on the vain side I went to a dermatologist.  He prescribed Retin A and daily antibiotics.  The regime never really made my skin perfect and cost a fortune (Ins didn&#x27;t cover).  But I figured it was prescribed, it had to be the best bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we decided to start trying for a baby I went off all my skin meds.  My skin freaked out.  Especially towards the end of my 1st trimester.  I had six large cystic nodules on my face, they looked like bee stings, when I started my search for safe during pregnancy acne solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzoyl Peroxide and Salicylic acid were out as studies showed they were either unsafe or the verdict was mixed.  However, both my OB and personal research confirmed that Glycolic Acid was considered safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired daily Loresette mud masks with this cleanser as part of a daily regime.  After about a month of use my skin is clear, soft and glowing.  Just the way every pregnant lady dreams her skin will look. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more thankful to have found products and a regime that work.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this facial cleanser for years and I just started to use it this year. I love it and I wonder why I haven&#x27;t listened to my dermatologist sooner. I rarely have a break out from my adult onset acne with this cleanser. It exfoliates without being harsh on my skin- no excessive peeling or redness.  I am now following all my doctor&#x27;s recommendations- yes, it has hit my pocket book, but I love the difference. I am trailing all her recommendations of creams(Neocutis facial and eye creams)she suggested-which I get on Amazon.com also. I will write a review soon on them. Thanks Amazon for carrying all the products I need!</li>
    <li> I feel that since using this product, my breakouts have become very minimal and my skin feels smoother and softer.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years including Proactive and Alba Botanical Natural Acnedote to name a few.  I never liked the smell and feel of Proactive.  Alba seemed OK but I would often get breakouts.  I&#x27;m going to continue using Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser as I feel it is effective for my skin right now.  I might also try the toner and moisturizer down the road.  So far so good!!!</li>
    <li> Really nice cleanser - love it.</li>
    <li> Best price for this product is on Amazon.com, and if you do the subscribe and ship, it is an even better price.  Shop around, you will not be able to beat this price!!!  (Now, if Amazon raises the price in the next month, you all can blame me!)  Just kidding!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I started using Aqua Glycolic during my first pregnancy because I needed something to help clear my problematic first-trimester skin, but didn&#x27;t want a product that remained on my face all night like a toner or a cream.  Alpha hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid are safe to use during pregnancy, but I still didn&#x27;t want more than a few minutes exposure to them.  This stuff works quickly and effectively.  I use it in the morning, putting it on dry skin and leaving it on for 1-3 minutes.  As I rinse it off, I can often feel the dead skin sloughing off.  Every other product in my arsenal - my Vitamin C morning serum, my night cream, works so much better because I use this product (about every other morning).  It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive (just start looking at similar products - believe me), a bottle lasts a long time, and it does the job.  Make sure to use sunscreen if you&#x27;re going to use it, as the package directs.</li>
    <li> This is hands sown the best cleanser I have ever used. I&#x27;ve had hormonal acne along my jawline as a result of birth control and it a month in has virtually disappeared. The old scars have diminished  my dark spots have faded and I rarely get pimples and. I will never use another product again!</li>
    <li> Having struggled with a  lifetime of cystic acne problems, this product was immediately effective and left my complexion soft, clear and healthy looking.  I hope others have the same effect.</li>
    <li> *Update review* I will not be buying the new version of this product as they have changed the formula and the glycolic acid is almost the last ingredient. Why did they change a good thing, they just lost a long time loyal customer. 😡  I have been using this product for over 15 years and I am over 50 and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet and I have very smooth skin. I get complements on how nice my skin is all the time. I love this stuff, hope they always make it.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly, gentle yet cleans skin thoroughly and deeply.  I used it with other Peeling produces I have purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My 18 year old son thinks it has really helped improve his acne.So, I keep ordering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin and goes on smooth and creamy. I apply it to dry skin and let it sit as I shower, then wash it off last after I shampoo my hair. It&#x27;s a great gentle exfoliant as I prefer exfoliants that don&#x27;t require me to rub or scrub with invasive ingredients.</li>
    <li> I had been using another system that was 2x the price and when I ran out I just couldn&#x27;t justify the expense. I found this product and though I&#x27;d give it a try. Not only have my cystic acne breakouts diminished almost entirely(hormones are sometimes unstoppable) but the dark acne scars I had have faded so much I actually dare putting my hair up in a ponytail because there&#x27;s nothing to hide any more. Also the texture and tone of my skin looks and feel amazing. Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from adult acne for about 10 yrs and tried this after reading a lot of positive reviews. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Great product - does what it says it will.  Must be very careful not to get it in the eyes.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended ths to me after I complained to her that at my age,44, I was tired of dealing with breakouts. She gave me a magic formula. First wash with this twice a day. I use it with my Clarisonic, which is the BEST!! Then she gave me a script for Acanya, a new acne med which is very expensive (over 300) but she gave me a coupon for a 50 dollar script which can be refilled multiple times. Just ask your MD to ask the  drug rep for the coupon. I also use prescription Retin A. This trio of products have my skin clear and blemish free! This is my new permanent routine!!</li>
    <li> Upon turning 30 I developed ache - which I never had before, even as a teenager.  I went to see a dermatologist who suggested this cleanser before trying stronger perscriptives.  In a few weeks time, washing with this twice a day has completely cleared my face.</li>
    <li> Very good with cream for me once a day.  I only cleanse and moisturizer in the evening because the cream and cleanse are too strong for my skin twice a day</li>
    <li> I was told by a doctor about this product about nine years ago and it really works great for me. My face always stays clears from acne ,I love you it and I got all three of my kids using it too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has a skin condition. This alleviates her problem and clears up the skin.</li>
    <li> THis product is amazing! I have been using it for a year and a half now and my skin has transformed! You need to use the three (cleanser, toner and lotion) in order to get the full effect. THe reason why this works great on young skin with acne as well as more mature skin with wrinkles and occasional cysts or breakouts is because both are suffering from the same condition.-poor cell turnover. The faster your skin can renew itself with new cells, the less likely it will be clogged or begin to look dull. The alpha hydroxy acid helps the dead cells to slough off and new ones to replace them. It helps with mature skin because it keeps your cells active and doing their job hence the more dewey complexion and smoothness that occurs with an alpha hydroxy acid. The magic ingredient that makes this product different is the glycolic acid. Derived from sugar, this acid is the key player in the cell turnover. Try this product you will love it. Also if you use the facewash on a dry face, the results are even better. Adding water can sometimes change the PH of a product making it less effective. This is why I use a mild cleanser like cold cream to remove my makeup and then pat dry my face and in circular motions apply the cleanser by aqua glycolic. Then tone and then put the lotion on!</li>
    <li> A must for anyone suffering with acne - I love this product and would recommend to all.  I have never been disappointed</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser - I&#x27;ve used it for several years. I am a Dermatology nurse and I highly recommend this product.  I order two bottles twice a year.</li>
    <li> I like this product, cleans my face thoroughly.  When I get blackheads, bumps, pimples forming I&#x27;ll put this on and the next day my face is clear.</li>
    <li> I used Proactiv cleanser throughout my teen years and into my early twenties, but as I got older it didn&#x27;t work anymore for me. Maybe my aging skin needs something different? Or maybe my skin just became immune to it? Who knows? All I know is that this cleanser does what proactiv used to do for me and that is to keep my face clear. Plus it is an AHA which is good for my aging skin. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Great product if you have sensitive or acne prone skin. If you&#x27;re used to a lathering soap, this is not it. It&#x27;s a cream cleanser best applied to a dry face. Massage it in  (or use a facial brush.!) and let it sit. Works great with my Clarisonic brush.</li>
    <li> Having always had clear skin, it was troublesome when I hit 30 and noticed the texture of my skin changing. My normally smooth forehead suddenly had a number of &amp;#34;underground&amp;#34; bumps that only disappeared when I went for my twice yearly facial. I realized that the only difference between the products my aesthetician was using and what I use at home was the glycolic mask. Based upon other customers&#x27; reviews I purchsed the Aqua Glycolic cleanser and face cream - within 3 days my skin was back to normal! I use only at night before bed and continue my normal skin regimen in the morning. The most economical fix for me!</li>
    <li> I live in a humid climat,am mid 40 and have very dry skin, except on my forehead at times??&lt;br /&gt;About 2 years ago I started getting adult acne, and it would not clear up no matter what I used.&lt;br /&gt;This is now my routine&lt;br /&gt;Evening: i wash my face with Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser. The description says put the cleanser on your dry face, I noticed that I use much less of it when my face is slightly damp. Make sure to wash your hand really good, any soap will do before applying. Massage on face, i am very sensitive to smells and this product even removes all my eye make up !&lt;br /&gt;I love to use Rosewater or any of the toners from lush (you can also find them on amazon) Tea Water etc.&lt;br /&gt;does not have to be the expsensive $ 28 sephora rosewater, which smells heavenly but wow the price!&lt;br /&gt;After the rosewater or any other toner spritz a bit over your face, neck, chest and with about 3 drops (I put them in my hands) rub all over . It is also safe to use around the lip area.&lt;br /&gt;I immediatly follow with a) either eqyptian healing creme, use only a very very small amount, I like to put this especially on areas that did still have some remaining acne healing going on. b) my preferred 98%of the time item i use after the hyaluronic acid is the reviva dmae Firming serum (all over the areas)&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also tried out the dark spot remover from reviva and their products are excellent ! will definitely try their hyaluronic acid as well in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I then use either any kind of moisturizer from the dead sea products(cheap ones) or any l&#x27;oreal creme, you will only need a very small amount since you are kind of layering all the products.&lt;br /&gt;But no worries, at least for me it did not clog pores and it indeed did clear up all breakouts !!! for the first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use argan oil or maracuja oil, no big difference except the price (argan is cheaper)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip lines, fine laugh lines, lines on my forehead are clearly deminished (no they will not disappear !!!!let&#x27;s be realistic) My skin looks as good and fresh as it did in my early 30th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning routine, I only wash up with water, add the spritzes of toner, then the acid serum, the reviva firm serum BUT only over the lip ,laugh and forehead lines ! I do NOT finish with a moisturizer as i found it slightly makes my make up slide off. (you must put something on top of the serums otherwise your skin might dry out and flake) I found Mally Face Primer does work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use MAC foundation, that I slightly buff in with a brush and my skin once again finally looks flawless, I still wish it would be a bit more dewey, but found when applying luminators, some take your make up off even if you use only a small amount. Bobbie Brown has a foundation with dewyness, but I did not find a good color match. I am a NC 40 in MAC. Try several samples between the NC 35 and NC 40 range if you have the average skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think overall I finally found my perfect cleansing routine, never thought i would be to 99.9 % acne free !&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid definitely gave my complexion an overall evenness, restored some moisture and definitely deminished the lines , especially also on my chest and neck, which really can make you look so much older&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this product works for you , yes it seems like runny water as some negative reviewers commented. But give it a shot , try it for at least a month . Good luck !</li>
    <li> It is alright, doesn&#x27;t make my skin tight after clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping will helps my break out, white heads or black heads. But It doesn&#x27;t help that much.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me.  I actually use it to shave my legs and it really helps to reduce ingrown hairs!  Works really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on for years. Gives face nice clean smooth feel when used regularly. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome face wash. Its been helping my skin clear up. I really like it and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I started using Aqua Glycolic facial cleanser about 3 years ago at the advice of my Dermatologist.I could see an improvment within the 1st week. I have always had large pores and suffered with blemishes. Since using Aqua Glycolic my skin looks so much better and I am no longer embarrassed about the way my face looks.</li>
    <li> The product is just as advertised, shipped quickly with no problems.  My dermatologist recommended this saying to wash my face twice a day that it would have the long term effect of a peel, keeping my 50-year old skin smooth and fresh.</li>
    <li> So happy I bought this. I have dealt with frustrating dry skin flaking-acne for a while. Acne for many years. I&#x27;ve done accutane, peels, tried so many expensive products its ridiculous! This made a difference almost immediately. I am so mad I didn&#x27;t know about this sooner. I have researched skin care forever! I have it now and it is wonderful. I waited about a month to verify its excellence and I am still very happy and I do have very sensitive skin too! . Please try it if you are struggling to find acne or anti aging miracle! Good luck.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about 6 mos.  My 61 yr old skin looks about 40.  Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible! it dried of all the pimples I had on my neck due to hormonal issues!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It does not irritate your skin. I use it with my Clarisonic and I really like that it makes my skin really smooth! Make sure to use sunscreen after you use it!</li>
    <li> This face wash was recommended by my dermatologist for tiny white bumps appearing on my chin. They are called milia. She told me to come back in 4 weeks if they were not responding. Well, are were all gone! I will be using this for life, as my only face wash. Gentle enough for super sensitive skin like mine, inexpensive - and it works!</li>
    <li> I have very fair, dry, acne prone skin.  I have tried proactiv, ddf, murad, dermalogica, neutrogena....you name it..I&#x27;ve tried it! While I liked dermalogica, it was pricey, so I wanted to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first bottle of this stuff lasted me about 3 months, and I bought a second bottle--which is a first for me!  It&#x27;s not drying, it doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant scent, and works well in the shower.  Like a lot of other people, I put it on my face while my hands and face are dry, leave it on, take my shower, and then rinse it off.  I have been using it in conjunction with the AcneFree Repair Lotion and an Oil of Olay night cream (and Neutrogena sunscreen during the day)--and my face has been soft, not flaky, and the acne is clearing up.  I am 33, so I am sick of acne!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend anyone give this cleanser a try.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of facial cleansers over the years, but had the following dislikes:  1) some are sudsy/soapy and not beneficial for removing eye makeup; 2) many now contain exfoliating particles, which I do not care to use on a daily basis; and 3) some creamy cleansers are too greasy.  This Aqua Glycolic cleanser is just right.  (I feel like Goldilocks.)  I use about a dime sized amount, over my entire face, neck and closed eyes - wash off with lukewarm water.  Leaves my skin clean without feeling tight like it would after a soapy cleanser.  I bought the two-pack and figure these will last me at least a year.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and also use the toner and face cream.  I really like all the products and would recommend them. I am 77 years old and my daughter has  started using the products becuase my face is almost wrinkle free and she wants to age with the same results. My dermatologist recommended this product because when I was young I spent a lot of time in the sun.  Aqua Glycolic helps to erase the sun damage. Hard to find in the store so I was happy to see Amazon carry this product.</li>
