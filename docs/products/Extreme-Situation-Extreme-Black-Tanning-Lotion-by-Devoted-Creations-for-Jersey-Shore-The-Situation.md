      <li>Super fast shipping!Would defiantly purchase from this user again!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything right away</li>
      <li>Thank you for fast service!</li>
      <li>Got my order extremely fast!</li>
      <li>It got me SUPERRRR DARKK in the first week I used this lotion.</li>
      <li>but try a packet out first from your salon before you buy</li>
      <li>I liked all of the other lotions that were in the \\&quot;jersey shore\\&quot; line</li>
      <li>I really recommend DC products all around: aroma, moisturizing, bronzing, etc.  </li>
      <li>or so i havent been getting much color.  </li>
      <li>It works really well.  </li>
      <li>i am very picky when it comes to lotions</li>
      <li>I really do like this lotion</li>
      <li>just really overpowering.</li>
      <li>was that it felt kind of sticky after it dried.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it it was a nice brown, but after a week of having it the lotion turned green!</li>
      <li>This lotion reminds me of sunless/self tanning lotion in a more extreme fashion.</li>
      <li>Provides a deep rich tan without the orange glow some bronzers have.</li>
      <li>I seen very dark color about an hour or more after my tanning session.</li>
      <li>Devoted Creation&#x27;s \\&quot;Extreme Situation\\&quot; is for the advanced tanner.</li>
      <li>I used this product last year while tanning and it really works!</li>
      <li>I erased my old review.</li>
      <li>You have to put it on very evenly especially on your hands.</li>
      <li>Then she grabbed one of the sample packets and opened it, sure enough it was green.</li>
      <li>it smells great, not greasy, and helped my normally pale skin get dark quickly without looking the least bit orange.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I did get dark but am thinking this is mostly the similar sunless tanning lotions or self tanners because it does wash off after a few days.</li>

<li> Monday i  used white 2 dark noithing</li>
<li> and i have tried white 2 black and that did absolutly nothing</li>
<li> First off, the smell was absolutely horrible, it was like a really strong black licorice.</li>
<li> So I asked her to check if all the other bottles to see if they were like that, and she said no.</li>
<li> i usually cant tell for hours if not the next day on how well a lotion works.</li>
<li> I am DARK..</li>
<li> You notice that where you don&#x27;t put it you&#x27;re slightly orange and streaky.</li>
<li> Just a little insight for people like me</li>
<li> then you havent wasted $23.</li>
<li> and if you are on of the few that wont like it</li>
<li> and you will get darker, but I&#x27;m not sure that it boost the \\&quot;real\\&quot; tan</li>
<li> If you are still not sure about this product after reading my review and others, all I ask is give this product a chance</li>
<li> I&#x27;d recommend this product though because I&#x27;m very very pale skin</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 16 and my skintone is very pale and hard to tan.</li>
<li> i have VERY pale skin and its really hard to tan</li>
<li> at least it did for me.</li>
<li> , obsessed didnt work, tryst worked a little but not to the point where i would buy it.</li>
<li> im not the only one that says it washes off in the shower :(</li>
<li> that was bad, but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I liked all of the other lotions that were in the \\&quot;jersey shore\\&quot; line so I decided to give this one a try. First off, the smell was absolutely horrible, it was like a really strong black licorice. The first time I used it it was a nice brown, but after a week of having it the lotion turned green! I took it back to the salon that I bought it from and told the girl who sold it to me and she said there was nothing she could do. So I asked her to check if all the other bottles to see if they were like that, and she said no. Then she grabbed one of the sample packets and opened it, sure enough it was green. I don&#x27;t know if it was just the lotion from there that was bad, but I definitely don&#x27;t know if I want to ever give it a chance again!</li>
    <li> this lotion smells really good and leaves your skin really soft. You can tell a big differnce in your color after one use but it washes off in the shower. at least it did for me. i have VERY pale skin and its really hard to tan and i have tried white 2 black and that did absolutly nothing, obsessed didnt work, tryst worked a little but not to the point where i would buy it. Just a little insight for people like me :) but anyways, try this lotion first and shower before buying. im not the only one that says it washes off in the shower :(</li>
    <li> I keep this product as an extra indoor tanning lotion.  It works really well.  The only thing that I dont like about this lotion is the smell. On the side of that the product has an excellent bronzing forumla.</li>
    <li> I tried a packet of this today at the tanning salon and boy is it sticky! it does work GREAT though. It smells really sweet and still smells good after getting out of the bed. I didn&#x27;t notice anything right away but it&#x27;s been maybe 3 hours and I can see i&#x27;m browner. I&#x27;ve been tanning relgiously since feburary and have reached my peak but this got me over it. It was $80 at the salon so $23.00 is amazing!</li>
    <li> love the smell and the way it feels when you put it on.  Non greasy and leaves you smelling fresh not like you have just been tanning.</li>
    <li> great indoor tanning lotion. i am very picky when it comes to lotions but this one is awesome. it smells great, not greasy, and helped my normally pale skin get dark quickly without looking the least bit orange. buy it on amazon- its like $80-$90 bucks at tanning salons.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for an excellent price! Super fast shipping!Would defiantly purchase from this user again! Thank you for fast service!</li>
    <li> Devoted Creation&#x27;s \\&quot;Extreme Situation\\&quot; is for the advanced tanner. I really do like this lotion and it smells great just really overpowering. I can handle that though.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about this lotion was that it felt kind of sticky after it dried. But that eventually went away.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for a while now and tried a few products but by far this is the best product that I have used. Most of these reviews say that this product smells great and I have to agree on that with them, it leaves my skin soft and smelling good after. If you are still not sure about this product after reading my review and others, all I ask is give this product a chance and you will fall in love, I know I have. Thanks. :-)</li>
    <li> Let me start of by telling you that i&#x27;ve been tanning for 3 weeks now 3xs a week. Monday i  used white 2 dark noithing i was white before tanning today(wed). Ask the salon lady what was best and she gave me a packet to try , and i must say its been about 2 hours and i already can tell im darker. i usually cant tell for hours if not the next day on how well a lotion works. It has a great smell and the value on Amazon is amazing. Come to find out that my mother tried this lotion just last week and she loved it from the start. she has been tanning for 10 yrs. but try a packet out first from your salon before you buy cuz it is a great lotion and if you are on of the few that wont like it then you havent wasted $23. THIS LOTION IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion does make you tanner because it has self tanner in it. You notice that where you don&#x27;t put it you&#x27;re slightly orange and streaky. I&#x27;d recommend this product though because I&#x27;m very very pale skin and I used it and ended up tan.</li>
    <li> I really recommend DC products all around: aroma, moisturizing, bronzing, etc.  This one is no different.  I think Anything Goes is currently my favorite but this was good too.</li>
    <li> Loved this product I got it really fast and the lotion works great!!! I saw a big difference in my tan after using it only once!!! The smell is alright just all depends on what you like!! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who needs lotion for a great price from a great seller!!</li>
    <li> i love everything about this product thank you so much! It smells wonderful and its perfect only problem if you don&#x27;t wipe your hands off they will turn orange.</li>
    <li> I love to tan and have been tanning for a year now. I&#x27;m 16 and my skintone is very pale and hard to tan. O&#x27;ve tried well over 100 lotions and this is one of my fsvprites. It got me SUPERRRR DARKK in the first week I used this lotion. I find that it works better if you let it sit outside in a warm temp. My house is always set at about 68 degress(love the cold)And it works better if it is warm. The scent is increbible! Lemon fresh&lt;3 I reccomend this lotion for all skintones&lt;3</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK! WASHES OFF EVEN IF YOU WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY TO SHOWER! JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I always buy my lotion online... I always look to buy from THE TANMAN... always the best deals, always on-time, always a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over a week and wanted to buy it from a sample I got from my salon. I seen very dark color about an hour or more after my tanning session. This lotion reminds me of sunless/self tanning lotion in a more extreme fashion. You have to put it on very evenly especially on your hands. I&#x27;ve never used a lotion like this before and had some extra dark parts in between my fingers. Look out for that and be sure to put it on evenly.    Otherwise, I did get dark but am thinking this is mostly the similar sunless tanning lotions or self tanners because it does wash off after a few days. You have to keep using it daily and you will get darker, but I&#x27;m not sure that it boost the \\&quot;real\\&quot; tan you are getting by going to the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion a while back and liked it but i really just loved designer skin, their bottles, and the smells.. Well the last year or so i havent been getting much color.  I dont know if its the lotion or the salon or what but i was using DS but decided to try something different and went to tan inc.. it was okay and lighter on the wallet but i just wasnt getting good color unless i was tanning 5x a week.  I like to tan 2-3 times a week max.. so i decided to try this one out again and it was great.  I am DARK..and im only going 2-3 times a week.  I have also gotten a lot of compliments on the smell.  this review is 8/2013  I erased my old review.</li>
    <li> I used this product last year while tanning and it really works! It does have a light bronzer in it, however, it does not leave you with a orange look which most bronzers do. Provides a deep rich tan without the orange glow some bronzers have. Defininely a recommended product. And I&#x27;ll be using it again this year to achieve the look and feel that only Extreme Situation can give.</li>
    <li> Got my order extremely fast! I&#x27;ve used it twice now and can tell a difference and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> Good lotion that goes on easily. The smell is not overbearing and very nice.</li>
    <li> Everyone thinks I just came back from a tropical vacation. Love this. I don&#x27;t need to tan as often using this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! It has a light scent to not over powering. Keeps skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;This was my second bottle that I bought.</li>
</ol>
