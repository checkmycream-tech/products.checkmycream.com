<ol>
      <li>Also, they do an excellent job at exfoliating and toning my skin.</li>
      <li>I LOVE these I&#x27;ve been using them for over a year!!!!</li>
      <li>BEST EVER</li>
      <li>Salicylic is the best, when it comes to wrinkles and dullness</li>
      <li>Glycolic is the best.</li>
      <li>They come in very handy for me to use on my clients who haven&#x27;t exfoliated their skin in a while before their makeup application!</li>
      <li>Good for body wipes after a workout too!</li>
      <li>They are great for taking off any excess sunscreen or makeup that my cleanser missed.</li>
      <li>They do a great job of exfoliating and it is noticeable if I skip a day.</li>
      <li>Good luck</li>
      <li>I had seen a surprising change in my skin, it wasnt breaking out any longer</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I love these pads!</li>
      <li>I love these exfoliating pads!</li>
      <li>But honestly, whatever.  </li>
      <li>My face did not appear smooth or bright any more.</li>
      <li>The pads leave my face very smooth and prepared to moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Just love these.</li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>Regardless, these facial pads are awesome.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>The reviews and ratings for this product led me to give it a try - and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I do love this product.  </li>
      <li>These are my favorite for acid toning.</li>
      <li>After years of using Proactiv Solution, I was looking for something more suited to my 50-year-old skin.</li>
      <li>These pads were okay.</li>
      <li>Every other night, I swipe these on my face while holding my breath, apply my pleasant smelling moisturizer afterward and then wake up to beautiful, glowing skin in the morning.</li>
      <li>All I really needed was the wash, because these pads did absolutely nothing but irritate and cause breakouts on my skin!!!!!!</li>
      <li>It helps even skin tone and reduce fine lines.</li>
      <li>I should mention I burnt my forehead with my curling wand (huge burn mark)</li>
      <li>So its important to knowing what type of skin you have.</li>
      <li>so I could take advantage of their free samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing special for my skin, but good enough for a stand by.</li>
      <li>Needed something more gentle.  </li>
      <li>I will try another AHA exfoliater with higher concentrations of acids!</li>
      <li>if you use it twice a day that means it only lasts 1 month this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Stick with what&#x27;s been a proven success.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the product itself is perfectly safe for my eczema-prone sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>really wanted this to work, I was so excited to read the ingredient list.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is for sure related to this product or another factor, but that part was cool.</li>
      <li>I really do feel my face looks more radiant and clear after using it.  </li>
      <li>Gentle enough to use twice a day, but still effective.</li>
      <li>But the lactic and gylcolic acids in this product aren&#x27;t strong enough to do any true exfoliating.</li>
      <li>Also the feverfew can be an irritant but First Aid Beauty says they are using the non irritant form of that ingredient.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is hydrating with the hyaluronic acid and let&#x27;s not forget the first ingredient aloe leaf</li>
      <li>With twice daily consistent use, my skin has improved tremendously!</li>
      <li>These are also great for travel because you can pop a few of these into a zip lock baggy or into a smaller jar and take them with you on a plane or just in your makeup bag for a weekend trip.</li>
      <li>My face didn&#x27;t really feel cleaner after using it and i never saw and dirt or makeup on the pad after using...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like this product because i can smell stimulate smell when i use it</li>
      <li>, however , your feel can be cleaned very well when u use this products</li>
      <li>A whole pad is too much.</li>
      <li>I really like these pads.  </li>
      <li>and I thought it would take forever to heal, but I used this every day and because it is a gentle exfoliation it helped heal my burn mark by preventing peeling and the burn went away so much faster than if I had just put aloe on it.</li>
      <li>I also love the slightly herbal, nutty aroma.</li>
      <li>My skin just looks brighter and I&#x27;m using less coverage foundation and mostly just a tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>(I have combination skin with large pores, sensitive areas around my nose and chin, and acne along my jawline).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
      <li>I have to use a nice thick moisturizer when I use this, but it keeps my skin looking smoother and healthier.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to test any new skin product on a patch of skin (behind the ear for example).</li>
      <li>Great product for sensitive skin, may cause random breakouts.</li>
      <li>i guess my ace could just be super clean, but i also wonder if the product is just not effective at cleaning the skin.</li>
      <li>this is a very close second.</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>And being a woman whos been suffering with Adult Acne had been a slippery slope.</li>
      <li>my skin is so soft</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled that my product came already opened, the inside seal was broken.  </li>
      <li>I also think this is a much gentler formula than the Biologique Recherche P50 because it has other ingredients in it that also calm the skin such as aloe.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I would choose it over my Biologique Recherche P50 V (new formula) because that stuff is a facial in a bottle, but if you don&#x27;t want to shell out the money for that one</li>
      <li>However, I have used many other products that are less expensive and were far more beneficial for my skin</li>
      <li>As a basic non irritating lightly exfoliating toner (due to the cotton pads) it&#x27;s not bad, but for the price I am not going to buy it again.</li>
      <li>it reverses all the hard work I&#x27;ve put into reaching my goal of clean skin.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin with Rosacea, and I have searched far and wide for something to clear away the patches of dry skin that seem to have come with age.</li>

    <li> I do love this product.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled that my product came already opened, the inside seal was broken.  But honestly, whatever.  I have a hard time believing Amazon would put something bad in there, or take some of the pads out.  I will just use it as is, and hope lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product itself is perfectly safe for my eczema-prone sensitive skin.  I have to use a nice thick moisturizer when I use this, but it keeps my skin looking smoother and healthier.</li>
    <li> BEST EVER my skin is so soft</li>
    <li> These are my favorite for acid toning. Gentle enough to use twice a day, but still effective. And not too expensive. This is my second order of these from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these pads! They are great for taking off any excess sunscreen or makeup that my cleanser missed. Also, they do an excellent job at exfoliating and toning my skin. The pads leave my face very smooth and prepared to moisturizer. I also love the slightly herbal, nutty aroma. I cut the pads in half to make them last longer. A whole pad is too much. I use half a pad twice a day.</li>
    <li> These pads were okay. Nothing special for my skin, but good enough for a stand by. However, I have used many other products that are less expensive and were far more beneficial for my skin (I have combination skin with large pores, sensitive areas around my nose and chin, and acne along my jawline).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this product.  I LOVE it.  I really do feel my face looks more radiant and clear after using it.  Its now a staple product in my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin, may cause random breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s helped my skin a lot!</li>
    <li> After years of using Proactiv Solution, I was looking for something more suited to my 50-year-old skin. My face did not appear smooth or bright any more. The reviews and ratings for this product led me to give it a try - and I&#x27;m glad I did. I really love it. I use one pad per day, once in the morning and then again at night, leaving it in the container to stay damp in between. The solution is mild and the pads are textured just enough that they exfoliate without irritating. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Unable to use them for my particular problem.  Needed something more gentle.  Had to return item.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have an expiration date but has very obviously gone bad. It smells like a raw egg or sulfur smell and the pads weren&#x27;t very soaked when they arrived. Spend the extra bucks to get them at a store instead of on here because they&#x27;re expired.</li>
    <li> Some people say they smell like licorice (licorice root is one of the ingredients), some say they smell like honey. I think they smell like cat pee. Regardless, these facial pads are awesome.  Every other night, I swipe these on my face while holding my breath, apply my pleasant smelling moisturizer afterward and then wake up to beautiful, glowing skin in the morning. My aesthetician and my mom even tell me that my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so I only use these every other night. I have never had an adverse reaction to these. It&#x27;s a good idea to test any new skin product on a patch of skin (behind the ear for example). I&#x27;ve been using these for 3 months and I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without them. My pores are smaller, my skin texture looks smoother, I have fewer blemishes and the overall appearance looks brighter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at Sephora. I am always alil skeptical when buying something new with ingredients that aren&#x27;t the norm for me. I am a girl whos totally vain when it comes to beauty. And being a woman whos been suffering with Adult Acne had been a slippery slope. This year in March I went to a spa to have a chemical peel. I had seen a surprising change in my skin, it wasnt breaking out any longer but I had scars. I was looking to have a Glycolic peel, but was talked into having a peel with a combination of Malic Acid and Latic Acid.... that was the biggest mistake I had and that decision set my skin back on a course of redness and breakouts. So my advice is to always go with your GUT. I stepped into my local sephora and picked up Peter Thomas Roth Beta Hydroxy Acid 2% Wash (which lasted for 3 months) and these pads. All I really needed was the wash, because these pads did absolutely nothing but irritate and cause breakouts on my skin!!!!!! I am a girl thats use to Salicylic Acid &amp;Glycolic Acid. Yet when it comes to Lactic Acid it reverses all the hard work I&#x27;ve put into reaching my goal of clean skin. So its important to knowing what type of skin you have. When it comes to breaks outs Salicylic is the best, when it comes to wrinkles and dullness Glycolic is the best. Stick with what&#x27;s been a proven success. And always do Your research... Good luck</li>
    <li> With twice daily consistent use, my skin has improved tremendously! It helps even skin tone and reduce fine lines. My skin just looks brighter and I&#x27;m using less coverage foundation and mostly just a tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Although it is pricey considering you only get 60 pads in a jar and if you use it twice a day that means it only lasts 1 month this stuff is amazing. I wouldn&#x27;t say I would choose it over my Biologique Recherche P50 V (new formula) because that stuff is a facial in a bottle, but if you don&#x27;t want to shell out the money for that one this is a very close second. I also think this is a much gentler formula than the Biologique Recherche P50 because it has other ingredients in it that also calm the skin such as aloe. I should mention I burnt my forehead with my curling wand (huge burn mark) and I thought it would take forever to heal, but I used this every day and because it is a gentle exfoliation it helped heal my burn mark by preventing peeling and the burn went away so much faster than if I had just put aloe on it. These are also great for travel because you can pop a few of these into a zip lock baggy or into a smaller jar and take them with you on a plane or just in your makeup bag for a weekend trip.</li>
    <li> I love these exfoliating pads! They come in very handy for me to use on my clients who haven&#x27;t exfoliated their skin in a while before their makeup application! I am keeping these stocked in my MUA kit now.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with this product. My face didn&#x27;t really feel cleaner after using it and i never saw and dirt or makeup on the pad after using...i guess my ace could just be super clean, but i also wonder if the product is just not effective at cleaning the skin. I do feel like i noticed a slight glow to my face after using the product for a few days. I don&#x27;t know if it is for sure related to this product or another factor, but that part was cool. I don&#x27;t think i would purchase again though...not for the price.</li>
    <li> Same as from sephora,  came sealed, smells identical.</li>
    <li> I have horrible skin. These pads (and the FAB cleanser) are the only products that don&#x27;t break me out or inflame my skin. I also use Paula&#x27;s Choice with these and they work well together. I wish it came in a 120-pad jar! Good for body wipes after a workout too!</li>
    <li> I bought this from www.sephora.com so I could take advantage of their free samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work, I was so excited to read the ingredient list. But the lactic and gylcolic acids in this product aren&#x27;t strong enough to do any true exfoliating. I have been using it since Thanksgiving and the only exfoliation I feel I am getting is from the cotton pads. I don&#x27;t have any extra radiance one would get from such a combination of AHA acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few other ingredients that are known to irritate the skin like the radish root, lemon, and orange. Since they were lower on the ingredient list I went for it. Also the feverfew can be an irritant but First Aid Beauty says they are using the non irritant form of that ingredient. That said it does not irritate my skin or cause break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no smell I discern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hydrating with the hyaluronic acid and let&#x27;s not forget the first ingredient aloe leaf juice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not get that tingly tightening with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has no alcohol in the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cotton pads are generous enough to do your entire face and neck. As a basic non irritating lightly exfoliating toner (due to the cotton pads) it&#x27;s not bad, but for the price I am not going to buy it again. I will try another AHA exfoliater with higher concentrations of acids!</li>
    <li> These are a staple in my beauty routine. They do a great job of exfoliating and it is noticeable if I skip a day. I have combination skin with Rosacea, and I have searched far and wide for something to clear away the patches of dry skin that seem to have come with age. These do it, and they don&#x27;t dry my skin or make it break out.</li>
    <li> My blemishes are not going away!</li>
    <li> I really like these pads.  They do help pore size and I can feel a slight tightening effect.  Periodically they tend to dry out my skin a little so I only use them at night before moisturizer</li>
    <li> I LOVE these I&#x27;ve been using them for over a year!!!!</li>
    <li> Just love these. Can&#x27;t say enough</li>
</ol>
