      <li>lol!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell the best</li>
      <li>It does work so great with diet and exercise!</li>
      <li>Smells great and feels tingly!</li>
      <li>when i after use it ,,i feel is  very good</li>
      <li>It feels good on the skin and smells great!</li>
      <li>great and texture is great too.</li>
      <li>I have always worked out and been in great shape so this is genetics not diet/lack of exercise.</li>
      <li>This works great it</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>they had one to use at nighttime that was as effective for this time around.</li>
      <li>I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>it is worth every penny!!!</li>
      <li>It goes on really easily, has a wonderful gentle perfume and you can feel it working - tingling and tightening.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i love it</li>
      <li>love this product, haven&#x27;t used in a while, think it works.</li>
      <li>I use this product for many years, it works but you have to use it continuously and massage your legs, hips, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
      <li>Tingles when it goes on your skin, but then it is wonderful, will see what happens now, I used this when I was younger and had more resilent skin, think it will still work if I work out.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve bought it 2 more times since then.</li>
      <li>i love this product~</li>
      <li>Love Clarins products for the texture and consistency.</li>
      <li>So be sure you are committed before spending the $$.</li>
      <li>I look even more toned</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>However, it does smooth my skin and moisture it</li>
      <li>the rest squats lunges and free weights</li>
      <li>(make sure to wear underwear before applying around your inner thighs because if you get it on or even near your girl part it isn&#x27;t a great feeling).  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t work completely on its own.</li>
      <li>you are consistent and use a massage mitt every day, in addition its helpful to work out and eat right!</li>
      <li>I use a circular brush for 1 minute each side 1-2 times a day..and WORTH the time and money.</li>
      <li>but I am very certain that it also had to do with the caffeine in the lotion</li>
      <li>The most recent cellulite lotions I&#x27;d used are the Nivea Goodbye Cellulite and Bliss Fatgirl Slim.</li>
      <li>IT really works!</li>
      <li>This lotion makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I first noticed it after about 2 weeks of using it.</li>
      <li>lured by positive feedback.</li>
      <li>I started using it and so far no results other than its a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I first bought this at victoria&#x27;s secret and it was $70, but I heard great reviews</li>
      <li>Everyone complements if I wear shorts that my legs are very smooth and my husband is surprised on my overall appearance.</li>
      <li>very sweet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my friend told me this body lotion is very good,So i choose</li>
      <li>so I bought it despite the high price.</li>
      <li>For the first time ever I have SOME major improvement.</li>
      <li>I really like the product so far, it does have a tingling action after you put it on to know that its working.</li>
      <li>Smells very natural~</li>
      <li>- I put it on in the morning sitting down from ankles to thighs with each leg in the air to help with water retention and rubbing lightly upward toward my hip.</li>
      <li>and so I ordered it again knowing I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I also used it on my arms early on in the diet until I lost the arm jiggle.</li>
      <li>I have tried Nivea, bliss fat girl, natural glow jergens firming, a BUNCH of holistic store brands...and nothing.</li>
      <li>I have no loose skin whatsoever since as soon as I was ready to workout, I would jog everyday and lost the weight quickly and was very concerned of having any loose skin.</li>
      <li>I should point out that my cellulite is genetic and not due to unhealthy habits, as I eat healthily and exercise 5 days a week (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and weight 125 lbs).</li>
      <li>This one tingles a bit when it goes on but not sure it really does much to relieve cellulite.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> already not using. oooohhhhh compulsive buying. lured by positive feedback. You gotta stick to the program to see results.... I&#x27;m a poor candidate So be sure you are committed before spending the $$.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at victoria&#x27;s secret and it was $70, but I heard great reviews so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. IT really works! I have been losing weight since my back surgery, (about 40 lbs total) and I have no cellulite in the buns &amp; thighs areas, which is predominantly where I gained all the weight, it also lifted my stomach and now that I am back into a size 4 instead of a size 9 I look even more toned then I did before I was injured. Everyone complements if I wear shorts that my legs are very smooth and my husband is surprised on my overall appearance. I have no loose skin whatsoever since as soon as I was ready to workout, I would jog everyday and lost the weight quickly and was very concerned of having any loose skin. I will be buying this product as gifts for baby showers and for friends who are loosing weight or complain of cellulite.</li>
    <li> I ordered this but received the Clarins body lift cellulite control instead. I started using it and so far no results other than its a good moisturizer. I&#x27;m bummed out that they sent me the wrong product.</li>
    <li> I order Clarins High Definiton every few months. The product does what it promises.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels tingly!</li>
    <li> i only use it for one week once a day. I do not see any difference till now but i hope it can work</li>
    <li> love this product, haven&#x27;t used in a while, think it works. Tingles when it goes on your skin, but then it is wonderful, will see what happens now, I used this when I was younger and had more resilent skin, think it will still work if I work out.</li>
    <li> I did not see any results.....so disappointed</li>
    <li> I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;But it is pretty expensive, so I won&#x27;t buy it anymore since the effects is not sure....</li>
    <li> I got this because I used it 10 yrs ago while on the HCG diet plan, it did NOT interrupt weight loss, in fact I lost 40 lbs in 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I personally cannot use this at night before bed because it is loaded with caffeine! And I have a hard time as it is with sleeping through the night. I realized it after the diet was over and I had stopped using it. Part of it was the diet itself that made it hard to sleep but I am very certain that it also had to do with the caffeine in the lotion - I put it on in the morning sitting down from ankles to thighs with each leg in the air to help with water retention and rubbing lightly upward toward my hip. (make sure to wear underwear before applying around your inner thighs because if you get it on or even near your girl part it isn&#x27;t a great feeling).  I also put it on again after showering in the evening (after work out and the day was done) the same way. It does work so great with diet and exercise! I didn&#x27;t have a single dimple on my entire body. I also used it on my arms early on in the diet until I lost the arm jiggle. I did work out 1.5-2 hours per day 3-4 days per week with 20 min cardio and the rest squats lunges and free weights, it was not easy especially on such low calories. On the non workout days I still did 20 min of cardio but one day a week of rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had one to use at nighttime that was as effective for this time around. I have 20 lbs to lose and so I ordered it again knowing I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it. I won&#x27;t be using it after nighttime shower tho because I need my sleep.</li>
    <li> Love Clarins products for the texture and consistency. This one tingles a bit when it goes on but not sure it really does much to relieve cellulite. You probably could get the same effect if you just put on a cheaper cream and massaged the area per their instructions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fanatical Clarins fan, but of all their products. This one though is a winner. It goes on really easily, has a wonderful gentle perfume and you can feel it working - tingling and tightening.  It&#x27;s not greasy and deosn&#x27;t cause a skin reaction.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I have had cellulite since I was a kid. I have always worked out and been in great shape so this is genetics not diet/lack of exercise. This stuff has made SUCH a difference. I have tried Nivea, bliss fat girl, natural glow jergens firming, a BUNCH of holistic store brands...and nothing. For the first time ever I have SOME major improvement. I use a circular brush for 1 minute each side 1-2 times a day..and WORTH the time and money.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  It also smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Would like to see it in a larger bottle at the same price.</li>
    <li> my friend told me this body lotion is very good,So i choose it.&lt;br /&gt;And when i after use it ,,i feel is  very good&lt;br /&gt;smile very sweet.&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
    <li> It feels good on the skin and smells great! I used only about a month, and I felt my tummy getting a firm treatment.</li>
    <li> Smells very natural~ i love this product~ i havent been using it for such a long time, so there has not been any obvious results. However, it does smooth my skin and moisture it lol! Hopefully it will give me a big surprise!</li>
    <li> This works great it you are consistent and use a massage mitt every day, in addition its helpful to work out and eat right! it doesn&#x27;t work completely on its own.</li>
    <li> I really like the product so far, it does have a tingling action after you put it on to know that its working. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had cellulite since I was a pre-adolescent, and have used a few lotions that claim to make it disappear. I should point out that my cellulite is genetic and not due to unhealthy habits, as I eat healthily and exercise 5 days a week (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and weight 125 lbs). But no matter what, the cellulite is always there. The most recent cellulite lotions I&#x27;d used are the Nivea Goodbye Cellulite and Bliss Fatgirl Slim. I might have noticed a tiny improvement, but nothing to brag about. Then a friend recommended this. She swore it was a miracle lotion so I bought it despite the high price. And I&#x27;ve bought it 2 more times since then. I truly see a big improvement. I first noticed it after about 2 weeks of using it. I use it 1-2 times a day and use a circular massager for about a minute on each thigh. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> been using this religiously for about 8-10 years now. helps dmiinish the look of dimply pockets on my thighs.</li>
    <li> I tried everything that&#x27;s on the market &amp; this is the only thing that works!&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey but trust me when I say this ladies- it is worth every penny!!! You&#x27;ll know what I mean after a week of using this!</li>
    <li> I use this product for many years, it works but you have to use it continuously and massage your legs, hips, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and texture is great too.</li>
    <li> I love this. It works but you have to keep putting it on everyday after you shower.</li>
    <li> Used everyday for a couple of weeks and actually started to see my cellulite get smoother.  Will continue with it all summer.</li>
