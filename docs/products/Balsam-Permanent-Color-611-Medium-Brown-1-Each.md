    <li> I love this color and my hair comes shiny and Like I had it colored in a salon.</li>
    <li> Very easy to do at home, but make sure to follow instructions on the box!  This color turned out very rich, and my hair feels soft and manageable from this!  Some colors can make your hair brittle and dry.  I did not have any issues with the use of this color.</li>
    <li> Cannot review as it arrived damaged/leaking</li>
    <li> The over all result were great my friend used it on here hair and she loved it...</li>
    <li> What a great deal!  This product really gets rid of the greys!</li>
    <li> So glad to find this on Amazon. It&#x27;s my favorite hair color and so cheap! Doesn&#x27;t break my scalp out like some of the more expensive products do. Makes your hair shiny and covers grey well.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair color.  Its very gentle and long lasting.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to and the color is what it states. It&#x27;s easy to apply and the color lasts.</li>
    <li> Very good for grey coverage</li>
    <li> easy fast arrival and nice product! came just like in the picture above</li>
    <li> I love Clairol Balsam Hair Color products. I have used them for years. My surprise was that there was NO conditioners included in the boxes! BUT ... the dye actually worked extremely well and using my own conditioner, my hair was as soft and shiny as ever. I would purchase again. (Price - $2.2X for pkg of 3)</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t be happier with this shade of brown it is a dark brown just slightly darker than my natural hair color which was exactly what I wanted!!!</li>
    <li> Like the Clairol Balsam Hair color. I have been using this color and product for over a year, works great and covers the gray very well and lasts and does not fade out and looks like my natural hair color before the gray. I dye my hair about once every 2 weeks as the gray roots start to show as my hair is short. One bottle works for two dying processes I just divide the two units in another bottle and mix and save the other half for the next dye job. The price is great and even better when they give you a $2.00 off coupon to use. Wife also uses this brand in another color and looks very natural on her too.</li>
    <li> great deal,.. can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
    <li> Looks good and easy to use</li>
    <li> Perfect color works great an I love that you can subscribe thanks</li>

    <li> There was leaking of the product when i received it. I didn&#x27;t even open it ..........</li>
    <li> Good color, I have very long hair so I need two boxes to complete the job. I get it all in one try! Buying them in a 3 pack is awesome wish the stores around me would do that!</li>
    <li> Colors well and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;If you have long hair you may need to use more than one box depending on the length.&lt;br /&gt;I found the color to be exactly what is shown and it stays that color for a long time with minimal fading.&lt;br /&gt;The dye doesn&#x27;t burn when applied or make your eyes water like some dyes do and your hair smells good after using it instead of stinking.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, color stays nice</li>
