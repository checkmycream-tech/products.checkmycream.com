### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The packaging is exquisite as it comes with two convenient resealable bags and four inside style mouth pieces.</li>
      <li>IF they do not, they suffer withdrawal symptoms that can best be dispelled by consuming nicotine again.</li>
      <li>would be great if they let you choose what flavors you want.</li>
      <li>Also, great price.</li>
      <li>I researched the plant and come to find out, people who are exposed to Sugar Cane Bagasse in processing plants are greatly susceptible to developing a chronic lung condition called Pulmonary Fibrosis.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the best stuff in the world, but it was ok.  </li>
      <li>and a pleasant experience.    </li>
      <li>And it taste good, mint chocolate and grape</li>
      <li>It produced good smoke but the flavor was horrid.</li>
      <li>Soex Herbal Hookah Tobacco is good, depending on the smoker&#x27;s preferences.</li>
      <li>The price was good the delivery was also good.</li>
      <li>It makes good smoke.</li>
      <li>A good replacement for any shisha.</li>
      <li>so it is all good anyways.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great and easy to shred and place into the bowl of your hookah</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, does not leave a &amp;#34;burn taste&amp;#34; after a while.</li>
      <li>it can be a bit overwhelming with the smell but smokes good.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly and was packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>the doctors couldn&#x27;t explain and I was so stressed from work that I was hardly able to breathe.</li>
      <li>The charcoal tab you put on top of the hookah&#x27;s screen heats the shisha below it... and guess what, the heated shisha generates some smoke.</li>
      <li>I think that most reviewers of herbal shisha miss the point.</li>
      <li>are the better of there flavors.</li>
      <li>this shisha is pretty good.</li>
      <li>and it gives pretty good clouds.</li>
      <li>This stuff tasted pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It is very mild and has more flavor than the nicotine varieties (in my opinion).</li>
      <li>More importantly...    </li>
      <li>There are better molasses available on the website.</li>
      <li>this particular molasses tastes really good.</li>
      <li>The flavor is filled with molasses and what tastes like glycerin.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend started purchasing this stuff because it claims to be Nicotine and Tar free, but then I looked at the ingredients and realized they were in pig latin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cheap</li>
      <li>if you want something cheap and don&#x27;t care about the taste go for it</li>
      <li>this stuff isn&#x27;t anywhere close to what they make it sound  </li>
      <li>but I guess for being cheap</li>
      <li>For starters, this alternative product contains no tobacco so it is free of nicotine and tar.</li>
      <li>While nobody seems sure of what ugarsay anecay agassebay is, this main ingredient seems to be derived from sugar cane.</li>
      <li>it might be just user error, but it tends to burn quickly</li>
      <li>The advantage to non-tobacco based herbal shishas is that they are not addictive, and therefore, dabbling in it once in awhile is not going to lead to a habit forming addiction whereby the smoker craves it more and more and fight trying to kick the habit for many many years, with low prospects of permanent success in beating the addiction.</li>
      <li>For this reason, it may have special value for those taking their first journey into the world of the hookah.</li>
      <li>the money, this product is worth it.</li>
      <li>I will say so far my favorite brand of herbal shisha is hydro herbal.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s not for everybody, Soex is worth a try.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this if you like surprises because it sure as hell surprised me.</li>
      <li>As a whole, I&#x27;m glad that \\&quot;Deals in Motion\\&quot; turned me onto a new shisha experience.</li>
      <li>If you smoke herbal shisha (or anything) everyday for many years you are just as susceptible to health problems including lung disease and emphysema as if you smoke tobacco every day for many years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lighter smoke than tobacco, but it&#x27;s pretty flavorful.</li>
      <li>no buzz, no ill effects.    </li>
      <li>it is actually more smaller than what it seems.</li>
      <li>The first three words are in pig latin.  </li>
      <li>Probably, since it doesn&#x27;t contain it&#x27;s own tar, nicotine or other chemicals</li>
      <li>Anyways taste ok but since real surveys aren&#x27;t out on whether this product is actually harmful for you or not, I say stick too the real thing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s healthy and when enjoyed in moderation, safe (and if you&#x27;re still uncomfortable with shisha that is nonherbal, just opt not to use hookahs- that option exists too!)</li>
      <li>Besides, too much of anything can have its downsides.</li>
      <li>thanks for wasting my money.    </li>
      <li>What really attracted me to this product is the price.  </li>
      <li>The real question is, is it healthier than tobacco?</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to nurse the whole bowl by yourself.</li>
      <li>Anyone who&#x27;s heard of miner&#x27;s lung knows what this is, however this probably applies to us as much as the idea that our burning coal will contribute to us someday getting miner&#x27;s lung.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Soex herbal hookah molasses, I use it primarily.</li>
      <li>Reviewer Matthew Dickens wrote about how this is such a fantastic value.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re going to get...</li>
      <li>By the way, the WHO make it sound like it&#x27;d theoretically be healthier to smoke a cigarette in that statement than smoke a hookah-</li>
      <li>yes, that&#x27;s simply my opinion, you can form your own later.</li>
      <li>I mean i got the stuff early and was happy about that</li>
      <li>If you want to enjoy hookah with your friends, no one will look at you weird if you politely decline tobacco shisha and whip out Hydro, El Rosha, Saalaam or Soex (Saalaam &amp; Hydro taste better by the way!)</li>
      <li>Many people who engage in it too much find that they crave it on a daily basis, and thereafter smoke it regularly on a daily basis maybe even all day long (certainly with cigarettes).</li>
      <li>it is also tobacco free, nicotine free, and tar free, so it is WAY better for you than smoking cigarettes (which taste nasty).</li>
      <li>and so far, Apple, Mint, Strawberry, and Mixed Fruit, all pretty much taste the same...</li>
      <li>Hookah smoking is meant to be a calming and social event with multiple people, moreso than solitary use - ie, if you really convince yourself that you believe the WHO says that one hookah session will give you 100 times more smoke than a cigarette*, then simply only use a little bit of it.</li>
      <li>Those two things actually generate the smoke when heated and are kept from simply being liquid thanks to the solid sugar cane being there in the first place.     </li>
      <li>Just use common sense instead of bashing good products for possible health risks which have no actual solid evidence produced.</li>
      <li>Ergo, tobacco based shisha is more dangerous as recreational use of it is much more likely to lead to chronic, daily use for a lifetime, and thus more likely to lead to serious health consequences.</li>
      <li>the smoke isn&#x27;t thick, very mild flavor.</li>
      <li>using shisha with cane sugar bagasse as an ingredient are generally going to be healthier than using cigarettes, nicotine,</li>
      <li>But, one can be sure that if one engages in chronic, daily use of soex over 30-40 years, one is just as likely to develop serious health effects as if one does that with tobacco.</li>
      <li>if you read the other reviews then you&#x27;ve noticed the whole pig latin deal which means they were trying to hide something  not to mention,</li>
      <li>The taste is a little over bearing at first</li>
      <li>They claim that smoking hookah with tobacco is more dangerous, but MANY PEOPLE are also forgetting that you CAN heat up a coal and smoke only a FEW inhalations of shisha and then CHOOSE to set it aside!     </li>
      <li>I am big into Hookah for the social aspect</li>
      <li>but it does what it sets out to do, mainly being an alternative for tobacco shisha and since its the only company other than Black Label to sell herbal shishas there isn&#x27;t much choice for non-tobacco smokers.</li>
      <li>Not bad for non tobacco product, which still has me a little puzzled like other comments.</li>

<li> Not bad for non tobacco product, which still has me a little puzzled like other comments.</li>
<li> Regardless of personal preferences, I believe that the availability of a non-tobacco based shisha is long overdue.</li>
<li> Do you want to pick healthy and delicious-tasting water vapor with flavor in it from a heated base of honey, molasses, sugar, and natural flavor, and savor it now and then, or do you really want that toxic cigarette (and waste of cash and health)?    </li>
<li> As expected, it lacks the buzz and overall &#x27;mojo&#x27; of tobacco based shishas.</li>
<li> , yes it&#x27;s strange that it&#x27;s in pig latin but sugar cane bagasse</li>
<li> The ONLY source claiming it is unhealthy is the WHO, who are also pretty sketchy if you research them</li>
<li> You&#x27;re not directly smoking the herbal mixture; the mix is also soaked in honey and/or molasses - no dust!</li>
<li> tobacco shisha is much more flavorful and smooth and thick, i was disappointed when i tried this stuff : /</li>
<li> If you shop around on the Internet, the same 150 gram packages can be found for less.</li>
<li> I will give a review for the others but even the smell of this is strong and artificial.</li>
<li> If you smoke it daily, and your lungs feel heavy or like there&#x27;s stuff in them, just quit using the hookah for a couple weeks.     </li>
<li> I will give the other flavors a try</li>
<li> In other words your smoking sugar cane pulp instead of tobacco with your flavored molasses.</li>
<li> Yes, but so is inhaling smoke from wood chips or any other source.</li>
<li> , however they gave me some flavors that weren&#x27;t expected (black licorice, aniseed, and cardamom).</li>
<li> HOWEVER the people who came down with PF were people who were factory workers breathing in the -dust- and handling thousands of pounds of bagasse every day for years.</li>
<li> This smoke goes down and the carbon monoxide mingles and is filtered into the water, and the water cools the smoke for you.     </li>
<li> However since charcoal itself contains tar, and smoke regardless of source has harmful qualities, smoking this stuff everyday still elevates chances of throat, lung and mouth cancer as well as other respiratory diseases.    </li>
<li> typically found in tobacco.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> People are being silly.. (yes, so is Soex for having a pig latin ingredient (anecay ugarsay abagasse... cane sugar bagasse) who are worrying about pulmonary fibrosis from using sugar-cane-based shisha. Why?    -There are NO studies done about casual sugar-cane-based shisha usage.   -People are flipping out in the reviews on Soex because they look up sugar cane bagasse and find people got pulmonary fibrosis. HOWEVER the people who came down with PF were people who were factory workers breathing in the -dust- and handling thousands of pounds of bagasse every day for years. Are you going to be doing that? Nope.   -People using shisha with cane sugar bagasse as an ingredient are generally going to be healthier than using cigarettes, nicotine, etc- no buzz, no ill effects.    More importantly...    -The HOOKAH itself. You&#x27;re not directly smoking the herbal mixture; the mix is also soaked in honey and/or molasses - no dust! The charcoal tab you put on top of the hookah&#x27;s screen heats the shisha below it... and guess what, the heated shisha generates some smoke. This smoke goes down and the carbon monoxide mingles and is filtered into the water, and the water cools the smoke for you.     ALL YOU SMOKE IS VAPOR AND FLAVOR. The actual sugar cane bagasse is simply fibrous material to provide substance to heat up along with the honey &amp; molasses. Those two things actually generate the smoke when heated and are kept from simply being liquid thanks to the solid sugar cane being there in the first place.     People, stop freaking out. If you want to enjoy hookah with your friends, no one will look at you weird if you politely decline tobacco shisha and whip out Hydro, El Rosha, Saalaam or Soex (Saalaam &amp; Hydro taste better by the way!) with your hookah instead. You&#x27;re not going to get pulmonary fibrosis from the occasional hookah session using an herbal, non-tobacco brand of shisha. If you smoke it multiple times every day for years, maybe. If you smoke it daily, and your lungs feel heavy or like there&#x27;s stuff in them, just quit using the hookah for a couple weeks.     Besides, too much of anything can have its downsides. Just use common sense instead of bashing good products for possible health risks which have no actual solid evidence produced. The ONLY source claiming it is unhealthy is the WHO, who are also pretty sketchy if you research them enough- yes, that&#x27;s simply my opinion, you can form your own later. They claim that smoking hookah with tobacco is more dangerous, but MANY PEOPLE are also forgetting that you CAN heat up a coal and smoke only a FEW inhalations of shisha and then CHOOSE to set it aside!     Hookah smoking is meant to be a calming and social event with multiple people, moreso than solitary use - ie, if you really convince yourself that you believe the WHO says that one hookah session will give you 100 times more smoke than a cigarette*, then simply only use a little bit of it. You don&#x27;t have to nurse the whole bowl by yourself. By the way, the WHO make it sound like it&#x27;d theoretically be healthier to smoke a cigarette in that statement than smoke a hookah- don&#x27;t believe it; cigarettes are tobacco doused with toxic chemicals, only 3,000 identified as poisons out of 30-300,000 various ingredients.     Do you want to pick healthy and delicious-tasting water vapor with flavor in it from a heated base of honey, molasses, sugar, and natural flavor, and savor it now and then, or do you really want that toxic cigarette (and waste of cash and health)?    I thought so too. Quit complaining about the potential health risks of non-tobacco shisha. It&#x27;s healthy and when enjoyed in moderation, safe (and if you&#x27;re still uncomfortable with shisha that is nonherbal, just opt not to use hookahs- that option exists too!) and a pleasant experience.    For me personally, I had been having bad muscle contractions the doctors couldn&#x27;t explain and I was so stressed from work that I was hardly able to breathe. Using the hookah and using shishas Soex &amp; Hydro enabled me to breathe slower and deeper, and it helped my muscles relax, and I became less stressed whenever I would use the hookah as well.     So people, please use your common sense. I&#x27;ll get off the soapbox now.    [..]</li>
    <li> The molasses were terrible. They don&#x27;t tell you the flavors online and even the quality is not good. I will never buy this item again. There are better molasses available on the website.</li>
    <li> This stuff tasted pretty good.  It wasn&#x27;t the best stuff in the world, but it was ok.  What really attracted me to this product is the price.  It&#x27;s really cheap and you get quite a bit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the money, this product is worth it.</li>
    <li> When I placed this order I thought that I would be receicing Mango, Apple, and chocolate or something similar, this order sent me a minte, wintergreen, and coffee.  Just to let people know.  I am big into Hookah for the social aspect so it is all good anyways.</li>
    <li> A good replacement for any shisha. The taste is a little over bearing at first but after a couple min it milds out. And it taste good, mint chocolate and grape are the better of there flavors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Soex herbal hookah molasses, I use it primarily. I was a little weirded out by the fact the expiration date stamped on the ones I just received were dated for November 2010 hence the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> I think that most reviewers of herbal shisha miss the point. If you smoke herbal shisha (or anything) everyday for many years you are just as susceptible to health problems including lung disease and emphysema as if you smoke tobacco every day for many years. The difference between herbal shishas and tobacco based shisha&#x27;s consist in this: because tobacco contains nicotine, it is addictive and habit forming. Many people who engage in it too much find that they crave it on a daily basis, and thereafter smoke it regularly on a daily basis maybe even all day long (certainly with cigarettes). IF they do not, they suffer withdrawal symptoms that can best be dispelled by consuming nicotine again. The advantage to non-tobacco based herbal shishas is that they are not addictive, and therefore, dabbling in it once in awhile is not going to lead to a habit forming addiction whereby the smoker craves it more and more and fight trying to kick the habit for many many years, with low prospects of permanent success in beating the addiction. Ergo, tobacco based shisha is more dangerous as recreational use of it is much more likely to lead to chronic, daily use for a lifetime, and thus more likely to lead to serious health consequences. But, one can be sure that if one engages in chronic, daily use of soex over 30-40 years, one is just as likely to develop serious health effects as if one does that with tobacco.</li>
    <li> They sent me one 250g box of golden apple flavor and it was disgusting also it tasted old. I would not buy this again....</li>
    <li> Not bad for non tobacco product, which still has me a little puzzled like other comments. The ingredients are in Pig Latin which has me a little puzzled &amp; worried if they do as bad as the real thing. Anyways taste ok but since real surveys aren&#x27;t out on whether this product is actually harmful for you or not, I say stick too the real thing.</li>
    <li> Images show fruity flavors. I was expecting Apple, Strawberry and mixed fruit. Instead I received Mint, Liquorice, and Apple. I hate liquorice. thanks for wasting my money.    .... about a month later and the seller did take care of me. They sent me additional flavors. I will caution you all though about the fact that the flavors are assorted so you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re going to get... and so far, Apple, Mint, Strawberry, and Mixed Fruit, all pretty much taste the same... the smoke isn&#x27;t thick, very mild flavor.</li>
    <li> if you want something cheap and don&#x27;t care about the taste go for it but as for me I didn&#x27;t like this product what so ever. the only reason I give it 2 stars is cause the only &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; shisha I got was the coffee flavor and it gives pretty good clouds. it can be a bit overwhelming with the smell but smokes good. other then that they sent to other nasty flavors. I got cola and some weird other flavor but I just threw them away.it would be great if they let you choose what flavors you want. but I guess for being cheap you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I mean i got the stuff early and was happy about that, however they gave me some flavors that weren&#x27;t expected (black licorice, aniseed, and cardamom). I would recommend this if you like surprises because it sure as hell surprised me.</li>
    <li> Ugarsay anecay agassebay, yes it&#x27;s strange that it&#x27;s in pig latin but sugar cane bagasse is just the fibrous pulp left over after all the sugar cane juices are extracted from the sugar cane. In other words your smoking sugar cane pulp instead of tobacco with your flavored molasses. Is it harmful? Yes, but so is inhaling smoke from wood chips or any other source. The real question is, is it healthier than tobacco? Probably, since it doesn&#x27;t contain it&#x27;s own tar, nicotine or other chemicals typically found in tobacco. However since charcoal itself contains tar, and smoke regardless of source has harmful qualities, smoking this stuff everyday still elevates chances of throat, lung and mouth cancer as well as other respiratory diseases.    Reviewer Betsy Yeary mentioned that exposure to sugar cane bagasse in processing plants has connections to the development of Pulmonary fibrosis. I think that&#x27;s probably referring to the fact that people inhaling any type of irritant daily either at work or in their environment, like microscopic fibers, silica dust or asbestos, develop interstitial lung diseases. Anyone who&#x27;s heard of miner&#x27;s lung knows what this is, however this probably applies to us as much as the idea that our burning coal will contribute to us someday getting miner&#x27;s lung.    It&#x27;s a lighter smoke than tobacco, but it&#x27;s pretty flavorful. It&#x27;s not great but it does what it sets out to do, mainly being an alternative for tobacco shisha and since its the only company other than Black Label to sell herbal shishas there isn&#x27;t much choice for non-tobacco smokers.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, does not leave a &amp;#34;burn taste&amp;#34; after a while. It is very mild and has more flavor than the nicotine varieties (in my opinion). Also, great price.</li>
    <li> So has anyone noticed the ingredients on the Soex herbal shishaw packages?   The ingredients say:  \\&quot;Ugarsay anecay agassebay + Molasses + Flavour\\&quot;.           ...The first three words are in pig latin.  Sugar Cane Bagasse.  My boyfriend started purchasing this stuff because it claims to be Nicotine and Tar free, but then I looked at the ingredients and realized they were in pig latin. I was a little freaked out.  Why did they do this, and how are they allowed to?           I researched the plant and come to find out, people who are exposed to Sugar Cane Bagasse in processing plants are greatly susceptible to developing a chronic lung condition called Pulmonary Fibrosis.  It makes me think that this stuff isn&#x27;t all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be after all.</li>
    <li> this particular molasses tastes really good. it is also tobacco free, nicotine free, and tar free, so it is WAY better for you than smoking cigarettes (which taste nasty). I recommend buying this molasses. it&#x27;s great and easy to shred and place into the bowl of your hookah</li>
    <li> las esencias est&amp;aacute;n muy bien, era la primera vez q probaba de mel&amp;oacute;n y de uva...&lt;br /&gt;gracias ninguna novedad en el env&amp;iacute;o todo bien...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect the boxes that are on the picture it is actually more smaller than what it seems.Plus it took forever for the delivery...</li>
    <li> Soex Herbal Hookah Tobacco is good, depending on the smoker&#x27;s preferences. For starters, this alternative product contains no tobacco so it is free of nicotine and tar. If your goal is a healthier smoke, Soex may satisfy. While nobody seems sure of what ugarsay anecay agassebay is, this main ingredient seems to be derived from sugar cane. While we are to assume that it&#x27;s safer than tobacco, there have been no studies to verify such a claim. The packaging is exquisite as it comes with two convenient resealable bags and four inside style mouth pieces. The given flavor comes through well and the smoke is surprisingly thick. The flavor is filled with molasses and what tastes like glycerin. For traditional hookah smokers, this will seem like a lite smoke. As expected, it lacks the buzz and overall &#x27;mojo&#x27; of tobacco based shishas. For this reason, it may have special value for those taking their first journey into the world of the hookah. Reviewer Matthew Dickens wrote about how this is such a fantastic value. It&#x27;s really not, especially when the $7.30 shipping charge brings the total up to $16.29. If you shop around on the Internet, the same 150 gram packages can be found for less. That written, the price is comparable to what&#x27;s out there and the buyer gets the benefits of package tracking. In addition, the featured stock photo is misleading since it shows much larger packages. See the product&#x27;s image gallery for my scaled photo of 150 grams of Soex. As a whole, I&#x27;m glad that \\&quot;Deals in Motion\\&quot; turned me onto a new shisha experience. Regardless of personal preferences, I believe that the availability of a non-tobacco based shisha is long overdue. While it&#x27;s not for everybody, Soex is worth a try.</li>
    <li> this stuff isn&#x27;t anywhere close to what they make it sound  if you read the other reviews then you&#x27;ve noticed the whole pig latin deal which means they were trying to hide something  not to mention, this stuff just isn&#x27;t anything like regular shisha  tobacco shisha is much more flavorful and smooth and thick, i was disappointed when i tried this stuff : /</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly and was packaged nicely. I got three flavors the one I tried last night was mixed berry. It makes me not want to try the others because of how artificial and terrible it tasted. It produced good smoke but the flavor was horrid. I will give the other flavors a try They are apple and lemon lime. I will try it. The price was good the delivery was also good. I will say so far my favorite brand of herbal shisha is hydro herbal. I will give a review for the others but even the smell of this is strong and artificial.</li>
    <li> this shisha is pretty good. It makes good smoke. it might be just user error, but it tends to burn quickly</li>
