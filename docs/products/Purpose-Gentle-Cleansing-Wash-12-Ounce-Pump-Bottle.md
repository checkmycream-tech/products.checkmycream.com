      <li>I don&#x27;t think its the best and am going to look for something more gentle.</li>
      <li>It is very good at cleaning but also quite gentle.</li>
      <li>I used to work in a medspa and recommended it to  all the young ladies who came in with acne and it worked perfectly for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>My skin got used to it and started breaking out more.</li>

      <li>and I could use it more than once</li>

      <li>This is my favorite facewash.</li>
      <li>Love Purpose face wash; always have, but it&#x27;s sometimes hit or miss to find it in stores.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>This wash is ok.</li>
      <li>I took her advice and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with skin and my pocket book</li>
      <li>Shipped to your door free makes it an even better deal.</li>
      <li>Removes makeup easily and leave no residue.</li>
      <li>pricing is really quite good and just about as cheap as a big-box store.</li>
      <li>Does not have a strong odor.</li>
      <li>This works great, does not dry out my skin, or cause breakouts or leave my skin feeling oily!</li>
      <li>worked fine as well  </li>
      <li>Smooth after wash.</li>
      <li>on 3/31/11: I am bummed to see that these size bottles are no longer available from Amazon with free shipping.</li>
      <li>We have different skin but it makes both of our faces feel great without drying.</li>
      <li>; Just clean, original Johnson scent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to really clean.</li>
      <li>I have combination dry and oily skin, this product works great with my skin type.</li>
      <li>and so I&#x27;ve been able to get it on Amazon in the large size.  </li>
      <li>Good product overall!</li>
      <li>this was because it is good for people with acne who use topical medication.</li>
      <li>It works, makes your face feel cool and tingly and your skin looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mild yet lathers pretty well.</li>
      <li>It is mild but cleanses well without drying out your skin.  </li>
      <li>The reason I tried it is that my doctor suggested it as a very gentle soap that is gluten free.</li>
      <li>This is a great buy (larger size, package of 2) that will last for many months.</li>
      <li>I love it, it cleans my face well but doesn&#x27;t leave it dry :)</li>
      <li>I love the huge bottle it comes in, the stuff seems to last.</li>
      <li>It is also rare to find this 12 ounce size bottle at stores in my area.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my Norwegian skin that is prone to being oily and dry all at the same time... not to mention the periodic acne most folks deal with, including myself.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because it&#x27;s advertised as gentle and the ingredients say it doesn&#x27;t contain a true soap</li>
      <li>If I could be more specific, this product seems as powerful as liquid dish washing</li>
      <li>For all the money my wife spends on buying various beauty cleaning products, this is the only one that I is great value.</li>
      <li>Also, my face was actually producing more oil than before after using this --and</li>
      <li>We tried many different things-</li>
      <li>Hopefully Amazon can negotiate a better price in the future.  </li>
      <li>It is ideal as a face wash because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin after using it the way some astringent washes do, leaving your skin scaly or rough.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a good cleanser for my face until my dermatologist recommended this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
      <li>very nicely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unless you really want to save twenty or thirty cents, get it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Gentle on eyes and skin but removes everything without dryness.</li>
      <li>From the most expensive ones to the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; all natural ones that claim to be hypoallergenic and good for oyu.</li>
      <li>Just ok, don&#x27;t expect too much, a regular cleanser doesn&#x27;t feel wow</li>
      <li>It is gentle enough not to clog pores but can really clean my face (which can be very oily during humid days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Since I switched to Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, my skin has become somewhat normal.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you have more sensitive skin and need a face wash that doesn&#x27;t completely dry you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered Purpose expecting to find a mild facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Even without purchasing as Subscribe and Save, the 12 ounce bottle was quite affordable averaging $7 a bottle (normal purchase) and $6 a bottle (Subscribe and Save).  </li>
      <li>It does not dry out my skin and it is very gentle.</li>
      <li>Generally, only the smaller bottles are available at Target etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll check back after I&#x27;ve gone through the first bottle.</li>
      <li>Removes makeup and leaves my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this in my local store very often anymore</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Purpose is so gentle I can even open my eyes while washing my face and</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin or acne prone skin, try this product.</li>
      <li>I used to purchase this product as part of Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save until it was discontinued under this service for frequent purchasers.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the soap in local stores at first, but found that the 12 ounce pump bottles offered on Amazon are cheaper than the equivalent costs in local stores.</li>
      <li>It leaves us both of us with healthy looking complexions, which other products costing a multiple more, fail to do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, and when I went to see a Dermatologist for the first time in 10 years, they said that they highly recommend this face wash,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin so this non-soap based facewash is great for my skin! Good product overall!</li>
    <li> For all the money my wife spends on buying various beauty cleaning products, this is the only one that I is great value. We have different skin but it makes both of our faces feel great without drying. It leaves us both of us with healthy looking complexions, which other products costing a multiple more, fail to do.</li>
    <li> Before using Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, my skin errupted in a terrible rash that persisted. Since I switched to Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, my skin has become somewhat normal. The reason I tried it is that my doctor suggested it as a very gentle soap that is gluten free. I have gluten sensitivity that goes beyond edible products.     I purchased the soap in local stores at first, but found that the 12 ounce pump bottles offered on Amazon are cheaper than the equivalent costs in local stores.</li>
    <li> I ordered Purpose expecting to find a mild facial cleanser. Instead I&#x27;ve found it drys out your skin worse than Dial soap. Terrible product, would not recommend. I am very disappointed, really wanted it to work...</li>
    <li> Product was shipped in a timely fashion. Product was packed well and there was no leakage from the bottles, which had been a concern. I mainly bought this from Amazon because it was slightly cheaper than buying it in drugstores. It is also rare to find this 12 ounce size bottle at stores in my area.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite makeup remover! Gentle on eyes and skin but removes everything without dryness. Generally, only the smaller bottles are available at Target etc. This is a great buy (larger size, package of 2) that will last for many months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face wash for over 8 years. I love that it&#x27;s soap-free so doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I have skin allergies and this is one of the few products I can use on my face. You get two large bottles and this was the best price I could find anywhere. Good product, good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note on 3/31/11: I am bummed to see that these size bottles are no longer available from Amazon with free shipping.</li>
    <li> The only product I will use. Removes makeup easily and leave no residue. I had a hard time finding it in store lately so very happy this is available online and at a great savings.</li>
    <li> Just like you buy in the store but a double sized bottle.  Just compare prices with your local market or walmart.</li>
    <li> I started using this at my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation when I was 15. I&#x27;m 43 now and have never used anything else since and hopefully will never have to. It&#x27;s so gentle. Not drying, no breakouts. Gets off all my makeup.  I have great skin, which probably has more to do with genetics than this cleanser, but I&#x27;m sticking with it no matter what!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried many expensive face soaps! This works great, does not dry out my skin, or cause breakouts or leave my skin feeling oily! The price is great and I love how it cleans my face! Give it a try...you have nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> Just ok, don&#x27;t expect too much, a regular cleanser doesn&#x27;t feel wow; Just clean, original Johnson scent. Smooth after wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks now and already see improvements to my skin. I noticed it leaves a slight soapy feel after rinsing, so just have to rinse a few more times. I&#x27;ll check back after I&#x27;ve gone through the first bottle.</li>
    <li> This product does not dry out my hands.  I have very bad skin, and it dries out readily.  When I use the Purpose my hands do not dry out.</li>
    <li> This cleansing wash is used on my face as an alternative or in conjunction with the cleansing bar.  It takes a little longer to rinse off.</li>
    <li> Takes care of blackheads &amp; whiteheads (yes, they do exist) . Thick liquid, easy to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> this soap is the base of the acne.org regimen that really worked to help my daughters skin!  We tried many different things- even Proactive, which is so expensive and seemed to make my daughters skin angry!  Purpose is so gentle I can even open my eyes while washing my face and there is no burning!  Also inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser and have used it for years on my 50 something face.  It is mild but cleanses well without drying out your skin.  Plus it removes make-up - including mascara.  I used to purchase this product as part of Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save until it was discontinued under this service for frequent purchasers.  Even without purchasing as Subscribe and Save, the 12 ounce bottle was quite affordable averaging $7 a bottle (normal purchase) and $6 a bottle (Subscribe and Save).  It is now nearly $15 a bottle (current price is $29.98 for pack of 2).  Hopefully Amazon can negotiate a better price in the future.  For now, I have to purchase it from other sources which is unfortunate because I love Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used every imaginable face wash out there. From the most expensive ones to the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; all natural ones that claim to be hypoallergenic and good for oyu. Bottom line is Purpose is the best. It is gentle enough not to clog pores but can really clean my face (which can be very oily during humid days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the Philippines where this product is not available so I always have a stash , but it never lasts for long because everyone in my family is now a convert and uses it too.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleansing wash that my wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended. It is ideal as a face wash because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin after using it the way some astringent washes do, leaving your skin scaly or rough. It also washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a thin film behind like other washes. It is very good at cleaning but also quite gentle. Highly recommended if you have more sensitive skin and need a face wash that doesn&#x27;t completely dry you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the price:&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s pricing is really quite good and just about as cheap as a big-box store. Shipped to your door free makes it an even better deal. Unless you really want to save twenty or thirty cents, get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great face wash. I use it daily. It does not dry out my skin and it is very gentle. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin or acne prone skin, try this product. I used to work in a medspa and recommended it to  all the young ladies who came in with acne and it worked perfectly for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of a reddish face which I finally discovered was due to an ingredient in my high end, designer cleanser, I made the switch to Purpose after reading it was given a beauty award by Allure. Well, bottom line, it&#x27;s been years and this is all I use for cleansing and i haven&#x27;t had one single blemish (I only use mineral makeup too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this face wash!! I hope J&amp;J never stop making it! Perfect for my Norwegian skin that is prone to being oily and dry all at the same time... not to mention the periodic acne most folks deal with, including myself. This face wash is gentle yet very effective! When I was in my teens my dermatologist recommended I use this instead of the harsh OTC meds or even the prescription meds. I took her advice and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with skin and my pocket book sure does appreciate it too! Would recommend it all day long.</li>
    <li> Despite what the product says, this soap is drying!! I suppose its good if your skin is acne prone and you want to try and dry the acne out.. However if your skin is combo like mine it will dry out your whole face. I found my acne reduced a little but the dryness is enough for me to switch cleansers for awhile.   -Not a bad acne cleanser , i found that it helped a little  -Leaves you with really dry skin if you use everyday  I don&#x27;t think its the best and am going to look for something more gentle.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s advertised as gentle and the ingredients say it doesn&#x27;t contain a true soap so I thought it would be perfect for my combination skin and I could use it more than once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product literally stripped every bit of oil from my face leaving it feeling tight, itchy, and flaky. My face became so dry that it started to flake almost like dandruff and even adding moisturizer would not help. Also, my face was actually producing more oil than before after using this --and that was only after washing once in the morning.  I dumped the product into the sink after two weeks of use.  What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to using Noxzema.  It works, makes your face feel cool and tingly and your skin looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t know if female skin would respond differently but this product was a nightmare to use and I don&#x27;t recommend it at all. If I could be more specific, this product seems as powerful as liquid dish washing soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this at your own risk.</li>
    <li> * Lightweight and goes on clear, but does not remove makeup at the same time  * It&#x27;s very gentle to use, but still searching for the perfect cleanser  * Liked the Lancome Milk Cleanser and Skinceuticals Cleanser as well as the   * Skineffects Redness Control and Cetaphil Cleansers worked fine as well  * Heard the Platinum Cleanser from Avon works great as well as the one from Glam Nation...too many choices!</li>
    <li> Love Purpose face wash; always have, but it&#x27;s sometimes hit or miss to find it in stores.  It cleans my skin without drying, doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes ever.  It&#x27;s just great.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this and it&#x27;s great. I started getting mild-moderate acne after having two kids. Even started getting a cyst here and there that required treatment at the dermatologist. Been using Epiduo topical medication on my face, which works great but is terribly drying. I was left with oily but peeling skin. This cleaner does not leave my skin feeling tight at all. Removes makeup and leaves my skin soft. Does not have a strong odor. I combined it with a Clarisonic Mia, Epiduo and the Purpose moisterizer at night. My skin is now healing very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: 6/13 - Just wanted to update. The awesome affects did not last. My skin got used to it and started breaking out more. I&#x27;d still recommend it though.</li>
    <li> I have combination dry and oily skin, this product works great with my skin type.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this is the cleanser I&#x27;ve been using for years.  Very gentle and does a great job cleaning the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Use it to wash my face daily.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating it this was because it is good for people with acne who use topical medication. It takes all of your make up off.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in my local store very often anymore and so I&#x27;ve been able to get it on Amazon in the large size.  It&#x27;s a good product and &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; is really true.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facewash. It&#x27;s incredibly gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
    <li> Some of the best face wash I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t over dry and it cleans well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, and when I went to see a Dermatologist for the first time in 10 years, they said that they highly recommend this face wash, so it&#x27;s a win win in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across it because I was looking for a face wash that wouldn&#x27;t react with my CPAP mask, and this was recommended on a Sleep Apnea forum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a good cleanser for my face until my dermatologist recommended this. I love it, it cleans my face well but doesn&#x27;t leave it dry :)</li>
    <li> This wash is ok. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to really clean. It&#x27;s very mild yet lathers pretty well. Very light odor to it. I love the huge bottle it comes in, the stuff seems to last.</li>
