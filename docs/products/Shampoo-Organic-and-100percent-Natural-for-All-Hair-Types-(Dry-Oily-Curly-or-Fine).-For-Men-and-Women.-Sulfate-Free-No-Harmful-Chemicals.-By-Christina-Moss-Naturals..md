<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely love love love this shampoo and conditioner!  Never found anything to match it.  My fine, blonde hair is manageable and silky like never before and I can relax in the fact that no harmful chemicals are getting into my body!  Shampoo has great suds and doesn&#x27;t take but just a small amount!  I wash my hair every day and is doesn&#x27;t dry out like in the past!  fabulous!  Thank you Christina!</li>
    <li> I think the shampoo is great. It cleans my oily hair well and it does not feel dry after. I always wash my hair twice because it is oily. The CM company also instructs to wash your hair twice during shower time. The shampoo foams nicely with enough water. It seems to not have a fragrance, which is why I gave it four stars. I thought it would smell like lavender but there is no scent at all. After reading the ingredients, LOL there is no lavender in the ingredients! The packaging has the photos of lavender on the bottle and I just assumed it was lavender! My mistake. It does say it contains rosemary extract but I truly don&#x27;t notice any scent. Great product for someone with sensitivities and allergies that like scent free products. This is a small bottle 8oz. I thought the bottle would be a bit bigger for the price. Using it twice a day, it goes pretty fast. The packaging was excellent and the shipping was really fast too. I would order it again despite the lack of fragrance, it works well for my hair type and I appreciate the all natural, truly pure ingredients. The follow up from the CM company is great after the purchase. Everyone has different hair types. I am not sure if CM has any samples of products to try. If they did I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> I hate this shampoo. It stinks like dirt. It does make your hair squeaky clean with just a small amount but now there is hair in my comb. What good is clean smelly hair if you are loosing it?</li>
    <li> I thought this shampoo was Certified Organic but I did not see a FDA Organic Stamp on the product. This product is overpriced for the size of the bottle and I used it for less than a week and it made my hair extremely dry so this shampoo is not for dry hair as its advertised, I did not like the smell of the shampoo unfortunately I ordered three bottles since I live overseas and now I am stuck with it I will not buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One positive thing about the seller they ship overseas and I received it pretty fast, but unfortunately I did not like this product</li>
    <li> Really great Product.</li>
    <li> Just too expensive for the quantity &amp; quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo originally as my &amp;#34;Sunday&amp;#34; shampoo to use in-between using my original Aveda shampoo.  The product turned out to be so good that I ditched Aveda altogether.  It also gets extra credits for being organic and cruelty-free.</li>
    <li> Well,&lt;br /&gt;This product is working fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is not itchy or dry anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Thank u</li>
    <li> I have been using the other regular shampoos for years which damage my hair.  Recently I changed to this organic shampoo.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Small bottle!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as another product I purchased but I still use it because it&#x27;s organic</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Natural, cleans well and smell very nice. Use with conditioner for softness and shine.</li>
    <li> I have used this product three times now and I have fallen in love with it! I follow their instructions and wash my hair twice; the first time I use about a quarter size in my palm (I have very long hair), the second about a dime size. My hair feels so clean when I&#x27;m done! Will definitely buy again. The item arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the product. I’ve done extensive research and ordered numerous “natural” products to try them out.  I’ve been disappointed with most. Either with results or ingredients. They state theirs is concentrated and 4oz equals 8oz. That’s a lot to expect from an old guy like me: use less. I’m used to my 16oz size containers, squirt a standard dose in my hand and be done. So emptying a smaller amount into my hand, as nitpicky as this sounds, will take time to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with shortly after placing the order I received a very thoughtful email response from their CEO. I admire their marketing and ability to make this as a personal shopping experience as possible. We will use this in our BR and our guest BR and it will be one of a handful of shampoos. Of course I&#x27;m concerned with how quickly it will be depleted in our guest BR should we forget to tell guests it’s concentrated. We retired to Kauai so have guests frequently. They provide info about it being concentrated on their Amazon listing but there is nothing at all stated on the bottle that it’s concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: We use the EWG’s Skin Deep app on our iPhone to help determine how kosher our skin products are. It either scans a bar code or you can place the product name in their search engine and it rates it like on a scale of 1 through 10. Our shampoo bottle has no bar code and when I type in the name it tells us “No products found.” Could easily become our only shampoo if it was in a 16oz format at a similar price.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo cleans well with no smell or irritation, will buy again.</li>
    <li> + Refined&lt;br /&gt;+ Cleans well&lt;br /&gt;- on the expensive side&lt;br /&gt;- seems a little watery</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo from more than 3 months..Mine is curly and rough hair..It made my hair more curly..And didn&#x27;t see much advantage for paying $36 for both shampoo and conditioner only reason is organic and sulfate free shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have tried many types of organic shampoos and this one seems to do the trick for me. First, organic shampoos make it so you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair as often. With regular shampoos, I would wash my hair everyday. I have hair down my back so this was way too time consuming. With organics I can go at least 2 days but with good shampoos, sometimes 3 and 4 days. With this brand it&#x27;s 3 days. Compared to others -- I seem to rotate between LIving Libations Seabuckthorn shampoo and Body Deli&#x27;s shampoo. All organics are expensive - in ranking Living Libations is most expensive, then Body Deli&#x27;s followed by Christina Moss Naturals. For this reason CM is a great value. Most organics don&#x27;t lather as well, for obvious reasons - in ranking CMN lathers best followed by Living Libations and Body Deli which lathered so poorly I ran through the bottle too fast. Re: scent - hands down it&#x27;s Body Deli. Their shampoo smells like organic heaven, followed by LL which is still quite delightful and CMN that is somewhat bland or plain. Regarding health, shine and overall wellness - Living Libations seems to make my hair the shiniest and most healthy, followed by CMN and Body Deli. As much as I loved Body Deli shampoo&#x27;s smell it lathered horribly (which meant I used loads of it to clean) and it seemed to dry out my hair. Christina Moss Naturals is the better value and performer of these 3 shampoos, I would love it more if it had a more pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> Loved this shampoo, hair felt clean after use, very fragile so don&#x27;t try to detangle. You must use the CMN conditioner to add moisture back.</li>
    <li> This really does make your hair feel squeaky-clean! I got this because I&#x27;ve been using Wen which I feel has not been getting my hair as clean as I&#x27;d like so I use this shampoo first and finish off with my Wen as a conditioner. When I run out of my Wen supply I&#x27;ll probably buy the conditioner to go along with this shampoo and see how it compares to using Wen. I have very long and thick hair and after using Wen (which takes a lot to get clean!!) I was surprised that just a very little bit of this product goes a long way!! I use about a nickle-size a couple times per wash. I love that this is a completely natural product and will likely continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I picked this shampoo based on the ingredients list. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have any harsh chemicals. So far I really like it. My hair feels much better than before.</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair very nicely with just 1 application of shampoo. The conditioner does not make my hair as soft as I would like it. After I blow dry it is very wispy, the best way I can describe it, so I have to put more hair stuff on. I do like the scent free. I have a friend who is very allergic to scents, so I feel very comfortable using this shampoo around her.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s concentrated and I can use 1/2 as much but it still works great. I like that it&#x27;s an unscented shampoo and that it has organic ingredients. Happy with the purchase and I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> No differences between this shampoo and our usually shampoo. I thought it will be better, hairs will shine, healthy, but no...</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo about a month ago. Itching in scalp has gone and hair are more shiny. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Nice Shampoo. Leaves hair soft without any residue. I didn&#x27;t give five stars because the top of the container is horrible. No way to squirt the thick shampoo out of the hole. I lost a bunch of the expensive shampoo down the drain while opening the top in order to get some out. For the price there should be a proper way to dispense the right amount.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this shampoo and I love that it is cruelty free - no animal testing. It makes my daughter&#x27;s hair clean and full of shine.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair that I get lightened and color on a regular basis, I also have really sensitive skin and scalp.  This shampoo has saved my life!  I hated my hair until I discovered this shampoo. My hair is left clean, my scalp is left clean, my hair looks and feels great!  My color does NOT fade with this shampoo either. I also use their conditioner...  which amazes me how little I have to use...  I am on my fourth bottle of this stuff and have no plans of ever stopping!</li>
    <li> Too oily. I have oily scalp. This is not for me.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever!! This shampoo has really helped my hair. My hair was dry and my scalp was very itchy. I have tried so many other shampoos and conditioners and figured nothing will ever work, until I found this. The best part is that it&#x27;s all natural!!! I have only been using it for one week and already my hair feels and looks so much healthier! Will be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it works! It cleans so well without the build up. I am picky about what I use on my hair as it tends to be combo oily/dry -- and I recommend this shampoo</li>
    <li> I have been &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; free for over 2 years, I have been using baking soda and apple cider vinegar. Well as much as I love it, it is time consuming. So I have been searching for an all natural shampoo. And so far this stuff works. It hasn&#x27;t stripped my hair or dried it out. So why the 4 stars, I wish there was an ingredient list on the bottle. I went to the website and was able to see what they use in all their products but when the shampoo arrived there was only the name on the label. That worries me a bit but so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any chemicals. Unfortunately, without knowing for sure what all the ingredients are, I won&#x27;t be purchasing the conditioner. On the website I read something about Soy being in it, well I&#x27;m allergic. So I have been using ACV for the conditioner. I&#x27;m still on the fence about purchasing this again but so far I kinda like it. I would also like to state that I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but I can tell you that my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is My Third bottle ,I have very very  sensitive scalp and has been bothered me  for over 5 years ,feels like seborrheic dermatitis  which makes my hair falling off more and more ---I changed thousands of shampoo but never made any progress at all . none of the shampoo on the store shelf I could use ,they all makes my scalp itch and keeping on lost hair ,then I found this on Amazon , I have to say the first bottle make my hair grown thicker and feel relax on my scalp !!im so excited and get the second bottle ,but honestly , it works fine but  didn&#x27;t makes me feel as good as the first bottle , looks like  the second  bottle of shampoo is more thicker i don&#x27;t know why .Maybe the company adjust the formula a little bit  . Then I took  a break and change to another brand ,OK ,my scalp back to worse .......so I get my third bottle of this Christina Moss shampoo right away  , i can feel my scalp is back and I do have more hair growing recently !! so happy and I will keep on use this shampoo because it&#x27;s the only one i think can make my scalp happy , I do hope Christian Moss company could keep their quality and product more and more great stuff for us !!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Bought for my boy with autism, after look for a gluten free-casein free- all natural shampoo for a long, long time. He absolutely loves it! It smells very subtle but awesome. Using it followed by t conditioner, leaves his hair so soft and rinse easily, which is great when your kid doesn&#x27;t like to be touched too much while showering &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought both shampoo and conditioner, and after seeing the results, I&#x27;m now a loyal customer! Also, the customer service is just amazing.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, mild, lathers well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this and the conditioner for 1.5 weeks, but I am already pretty satisfied with these products. I have been suffering from dandruff for approximately 2-3 years. Initially I tried a couple dandruff shampoos (Neutrogena and Head&amp;Shoulders Classic Clean) and none of them solved the issue. I tried L&#x27;oreal (the one that claims has no sulfates) and it didn&#x27;t work either. I then changed to Head&amp;Shoulders Clinical Strength (the one on the dark blue bottle with orange shampoo) and I finally found the one that resolved the dandruff and itch issue. However, I didn&#x27;t want to over do it with the &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34;, but whenever I changed to any other brand my scalp became itchy and flaky in a matter of days or just a couple of weeks and I had to go back to H&amp;S.  Now, I decided to get a 100% organic shampoo because H&amp;S was starting to make my hair oily and even when I had just washed my hair, it felt heavy and greasy. After 1.5 weeks of using Christina Moss Shampoo and Conditioner I have been able to know what it feels like to have a clean scalp and bouncy hair. I have very fine, straight hair with not a lot of volume, and these products give it the volume I was looking for. Granted, my hair still gets oily because I practice yoga at least 5 days a week, sweat profusely, and I live in Puerto Rico where the weather is hot and very humid, but every time I&#x27;ve washed my hair with the CM shampoo it leaves it feeling light and clean. The first two or three times I washed my hair with it, I noticed white flakes on my head that I don&#x27;t know if it was dandruff that was starting to come off as I had gone back to H&amp;S Classic Clean before deciding on CM, but they have disappeared since then and my scalp is seldom itchy. It is true what other buyers have said and the seller about washing your hair twice as the second wash will generate a thicker lather and will leave it squeaky clean. I still haven&#x27;t tried leaving a small amount of conditioner on after towel drying my hair, but hopefully I will give this a try when I go to the beach during the summer. The only think I am still getting used to is the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t have that fragrant smell after I wash it, as I really liked that about my previous shampoos - maybe the only thing I really liked- (the CM shampoo has basically no scent and the conditioner only a mild, but very pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t really linger on my hair).  This is a definite must if you&#x27;re looking for natural, organic products. Knowing that my body is not absorbing any harmful chemicals is also a huge relieve and gives me peace of mind.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. It left my hair squeaky clean. The only down side (hence the 4 stars) is it left my hair extremely tangled. The conditioner from Christina Moss handled them with no problem. I would order this again. My hair is clean without the scalp feeling dried out and itchy. And I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t give up on natural shampoo (and conditioner) until you try this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying everything out there, including natural, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; (by that I mean it says natural but has hidden chemicals) baking soda, Castile, shampoo bars etc I wanted to give up on my frizzy greasy limp ugly hair. I gave it one more shot and bought this stuff. Purely awesome! It saved my hair which was totally damaged from a &amp;#34;conditioning rinse&amp;#34; I purchased (and trashed) and it kept my hair smooth on a very humid day. No dry ends, no limp hair, non oily, no bad scents, no chemicals. Thank you Christina moss. Very happy. I use this the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat order for me. I love this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the first shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had that didn&#x27;t make my scalp break out. I was constantly having to get a medicated shampoo to clear up the rash only to have it return within a few days of stopping the medicated shampoo and returning to my regular shampoo. I was using one I thought was more natural and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different shampoos over the years. This is the only one that has not caused a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the way the shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel and behave. It&#x27;s a win-win for me. Thank you so much for your wonderful products.</li>
    <li> I have thick, oily color treated hair. This is the best natural shampoo I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for nigh on 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;m in love with it!  I have tried many other &amp;#34;all-natural/organic&amp;#34; products, and none of them work as well as this one.  Other shampoos either leave my hair still feeling dirty or feeling squeaky clean (an almost unnaturally &amp;#34;too clean&amp;#34; feeling).  This shampoo does not do that.  I had problems in the past with &amp;#34;all-natural/organic&amp;#34; products making my already thin hair fall out.  That is not a problem with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is the only negative aspect for me.  Organic ingredients have been getting more expensive over the last couple years, and it has hit this company some, but they do their best to &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; the cost increases themselves and not pass them on to the customers.  Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than some other hair products.  While I do always consider price when I decide to (or not to) buy a product, I also know that sometimes better quality is simply more expensive.  In this case, I believe it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love the shampoo, I love the company even more.  I have e-mailed back and forth with Kenny (the company&#x27;s CEO) quite a few times now, and I am incredibly impressed with his customer service.  E-mails are always answered promptly (some over the weekend!), questions/concerns always addressed, he asked how my experience with the products had gone, he asked how the products/service could be better, and I even received a special discount for my next order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products!  Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> As every Christina Moss product it&#x27;s very nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost doesn&#x27;t have any foam but for me it&#x27;s not a big deal because I have a short hair. If you have a longer/long hair I think you might use to much of this shampoo. Taking into account that bottle is quite small (same size as Facial Wash), you might be dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, shampoo by itself is very nice and cleanses your hair very good even from the first try.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It is hard to find a shampoo that is both chemical and fragrance free.  I would recommend it to others with chemical sensitivities.</li>
    <li> Love it! Did not dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use many shampoos or soaps because I have a bad reaction to most of them. My skin starts to itch and does for hours later on in the day.  I look for simple ingredients that don&#x27;t have words that I can&#x27;t pronounce.  That&#x27;s why I purchased this shampoo.  I received a wonderful email from the company, too. Very unusual and old fashioned, and wonderful.  Just be aware that the bottle is not the average size bottle. It is quite small, but I am sure the ingredients are pricey to make.</li>
    <li> Gentle and fragrant.  Highly recommend.  Not harsh</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! I have just begun my journey in using naturally made products and this hair product is setting my standards high! I am pleasantly surprised that my hair can look so smooth and silky with all natural ingredients. It makes sense I guess... No more harsh chemicals to strip my hair of all that is it meant to be... Natural. My hair is long, quite thin ... And I only need to use about the size of a dime. You really need to work the shampoo through the hair. It was a little different to barely have a lather... But I would rather this happen than have to deal with a chemically infested product. I am so grateful I came across this shampoo when I was searching for naturally made shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is also incredible. This product is highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> My hair has been bleached and abused by styling tools, but the shampoo has actually reversed the dry and frizz of my hair! It is softer, shinier and no more frizz without putting product in. Yaaeee ;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend you do something good for yourself and your hair.</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely and leaves my hair full of volume!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over the last few months now.  I love them.  The subtle organic smell of Lavender and Licorice, which are both Organic preservatives.  I like that it is concentrated, and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot. Most of the high-end lines are that way and this is no exception.  I feel my hair doesn&#x27;t shed as much in using this shampoo and conditioner and the conditioner works great!  And the soap bar is moisturizing!  I&#x27;ll be continuing to use these products daily.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo, next time ill get conditioner as well</li>
    <li> Wonderful feeling hair. Only used small amount and worked it in.</li>
    <li> This will be one of go-tos now that I am using only organic products. Smells great, works well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not loving this shampoo.  The consistency is really watery.  So you have to use a lot, it runs off your hands almost before you can get onto your hair.  The bottle is very small.  By two uses, I&#x27;d already used over 1/4 of the bottle. Nope, not for me.  Love organic shampoos but I need products that are worth the money!</li>
    <li> I live it very much.  Leaves hair silky.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase from Christina Moss Naturals. Since I loved the facial wash so much, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try before the chemical-laden shampoo that I currently use ran out. After several shampoo-ings, I have found that my hair looks full and soft and prettier than it has ever looked, even before hot ironing.  I have easy-to-frizz hair, and the blow dryer usually does a number on it.  Now I can forego the hot iron and wear my hair au naturale if I want to. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds up, so I take the product (just a little bit-remember it&#x27;s concentrated) on the tips of my fingers and go under my hair and massage it into my scalp. When I rinse my hair, it feels soft and squeaky clean.  Note: I learned today from the maker that if you shampoo twice you&#x27;ll get more suds, if that&#x27;s your thang. I condition twice with their matching conditioner because my hair tends to be dry, and that works great for me.  The customer service for the Christina Moss products is amazing too.  I would definitely highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had only been washing my hair every other day with my previous shampoo so I wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair out. It was a fine product but had sulfates. Wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo and came across this brand. From the first wash my hair has felt softer, healthier and happier. I now wash it everyday, but know this product isn&#x27;t stripping or overly drying my hair. It is a different consistency than most sudsy shampoos, but that is fine with me as my hair still feels clean and better than when I was using any other product. Wonderful ingredients, super happy with all the products from this brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use more natural products. This was one that I found. I really like it and would recommend it to anyone who likes Dr. Bonner&#x27;s type products.  It comes out fast and you only need a dime size dot to wash your hair.  I actually wash mine twice.. once seems to get all the crude off.. the second seems to lather up quickly and I feel that it does a great job of cleaning my hair)  I&#x27;ll continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product!  the best shampoo I have ever used!  Leaves my hair feeling lighter, cleaner, and healthy!  I appreciate the feedback from the company as they stand behind their product.  It is a little pricy but so worth it!  I liked that the company knew about the importance of your skin being an organ that needs to not be polluted with chemicals...easy 5 star&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> Now my favorite shampoo!  And, I couldn&#x27;t be more in agreement with &amp;#34;don&#x27;t put ON YOU anything you wouldn&#x27;t put IN YOU!&amp;#34;  :-)  I do try to use at least two different kinds of shampoo, but this is currently one which I WON&#x27;T BE CHANGING!  Bravo!</li>
    <li> Only one I&#x27;ll ever buy now.  Has made an unbelievable transformation of my hair.  My hair is fuller and thicker and oh so soft.</li>
    <li> First of all for the reviewers who are saying the shampoo makes their hair dry I suggest you try the conditioner also ! It does wonders 😊&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was using regular shampoo my hair used to fall so badly in the shower and now that I&#x27;m using Christina shampoo only one or two hair will fall in the shower , I&#x27;m on my second bottle the pricing is a little high but surprisingly you only need a little to lather and my first bottle lasted for 1.5 months and I wash my hair twice a week. It smells good too, only issue is for the conditioner the bottle is annoying to squeeze as it gets really bent out of shape and takes some time for you to reshape it to its original form, otherwise happy customer here!</li>
    <li> This is the only natural (none of the bad stuff) shampoo &amp; conditioner that I found that actually makes your hair feel wonderful and silky!  Its on the pricey side, but you don&#x27;t need a lot when your using it.</li>
    <li> You have to use it twice to get suds and the bottle is really small, so it doesn&#x27;t last long if you have long thick hair.  I tried to use just a little and treating it as concentrated, but that work out well.  The product itself is fine, and on a couple of days I think it was the reason for my &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34; day.  If there was a more reasonably normal sized bottle for the price, I would consider re-purchasing.  For now, I have moved on.</li>
    <li> My hair is luxurious and shinny.  I would recommend it any time.</li>
    <li> Great product and worth the money</li>
    <li> I totally agree with the review posted by SAG.  The quality of all their products (shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer) degraded significantly with the size of bottles been doubled.  Basically, the products are lot more watery compared with the earlier ones.  Have used their earlier products which were wonderful, the current ones are disappointing.  I understand they considered customers&#x27; feedbacks saying the products are small and pricy.  Pricing is only one factor to retain customer, but quality &amp; consistency are what really matter to me.  I could live with paying a little more to get quality products, and that was the reason that I kept going back.  But after tried out their new ones in bigger bottles, I was very hesitated to purchase them again.  Very sad.  I wish I could stay with their products, but I will have to move on.  Hope they could revert back to the original formula.  It hurts customer loyalty.</li>
    <li> As with the conditioner, I was very excited to receive and try this shampoo. I&#x27;ve had 3 surgeries in 10 months, and it has wrecked my hair. This did not work for me. It left my hair knotted and oily. However, it does a beautiful job of making my 7 year old son&#x27;s hair clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Super stuff! Really cleaned my hair and left it feeling fantastic! I used this along with the conditioner.  I received this product complimentary for my honest review.</li>
    <li> It lives up to its billing as a gentle salon-style shampoo for hair. It has a really nice subtle herby smell and my hair is super shiny and healthy after using it. It also seems to preserve my hair coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my well water, it leaves my hair feeling a bit squeaky-tacky, but not in a stripped-all-the-oil way. It is a bit odd, but the feeling goes away after I use conditioner.  These kinds of effects can really depend on water chemistry, so this may not be a general problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small - so this shampoo is not a bargain. I will probably buy it again though since this is the only gentle sulfate-free, natural, and fragrance-free shampoo that I have found.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a great shampoo.  My hair feels super soft.  No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Finally a great minimal ingredient hair product that works and feels like other shampoos! Thanks so much! Only gave it a four star because of the price for such a small bottle!</li>
    <li> A wonderful shampoo. Leaves your hair clean,fresh and smelling great.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well on oily hair.  Nice to know it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling squeaky clean. Already ordered more.</li>
    <li> Stinky garbage. Man, this stuff smelled like rancid fat.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or make it oily like many products do. And I know it is healthy for my hair as well!</li>
    <li> A little pricey but worth it. Gives my hair more body and great shine.</li>
    <li> As you probably know, it&#x27;s a struggle to find a shampoo with non-toxic ingredients. From what I can tell, maybe apart from the 2nd ingredient, which I have to research more heavily, but that I have seen in other reputable organic cleaning products - the ingredients on this list are all recognizable, and probably safe. That was my number 1 criterion (I had been on baking soda and apple cider vinegar for a while, and...needless to say, this has better results). It is a small bottle but I was pleasantly surprised by how little is needed to actually clean. My toddler and I have been using it for several months. It leaves the hair squeaky clean; we also have to follow up with conditioner but it&#x27;s OK (I have to anyway as my hair otherwise knots no matter what shampoo I use). I have not noticed any smell. I&#x27;m glad this product is available as I&#x27;ve done an extensive amazon search and not found anything with as few, non toxic ingredients (not even organic baby products), so. Holding onto this while it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have fine dry hair and now in my mid 60&#x27;s find my hair is beginning to thin.&lt;br /&gt;Also two years ago I had a melanoma removed from the forward portion of&lt;br /&gt;my scalp and it was necessary to resection and reconstruct scalp to cover the&lt;br /&gt;open area after the surgery.  So of course this had an impact on hair coverage&lt;br /&gt;and I have always been careful to use mild shampoos but many left my hair&lt;br /&gt;somewhat flat and limp.  However this shampoo is just great in that it is mild&lt;br /&gt;but really gives great body and sheen.  Also being organic I have peace of&lt;br /&gt;mind that I am not applying anything harsh to my scalp.  And also a little&lt;br /&gt;goes a long way, so price wise I  have no problem.  For that matter some of&lt;br /&gt;the upscale shampoos are within this price range, but why pay for something&lt;br /&gt;that is simply chemicals of unknown origin.  I really and truly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
    <li> seems to really strip the hair clean......must use conditioner after!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product. I&#x27;m using it for my son who is 6 years old. I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and it works great for me!  I&#x27;ve found that I have to use just a small amount. This shampoo and the conditioner are a great combo!</li>
    <li> At first you will realize that it foams much less and you will tend to use more of the shampoo. After a few uses though you will see that you only need a tiny amount (size of 2 peas for long hair), rinse it out, and your hair is perfectly clean, shiny, and healthy. It does not foam as much due to the lack of chemicals usually producing it - and you really do not need it. I use it in combination with the conditioner and my hair went through a dramatic positive change. Unfortunately I cannot tell for sure whether it is the shampoo, the conditioner, or the combination of the two.</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased this product. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but it was great for my hair. I am purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo! I&#x27;ve never noticed how bad the shampoo I was using was until after I&#x27;ve used this. I don&#x27;t get that foamy, crunchy feeling of shampoo on my hair when using this. Doesn&#x27;t have that gross, fake scent to it either.  My hair actually feels so soft now. This is perfect when used with the conditioner, too.</li>
    <li> Small amount works - hair manageable without additional products - when using flat iron, I still use a heat protective shine.&lt;br /&gt;No intense smell, no fragrance, clean minimal components.  Christina Moss, love your product, love your philosophy.  Great customer service, with free download informational book, and nice your tube videos.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a dream come true, my hair has never felt better. now , to get the conditioner, and more of teh shampoo for my friends....</li>
    <li> Felt like i took shower from dish soap</li>
    <li> Stripped my hair, made it unmanageable even with conditioner,  had to get deep conditioner so my hair would be back to normal, it took the shine out of my hair also, I have thin hair, I tried it for two days</li>
    <li> Using Christina Moss Naturals has helped my hair - it is fuller, my color isn&#x27;t stripped. This all natural shampoo leaves my hair clean and shiny! You only have to use a small amount - it doesn&#x27;t lather up like dish washing soap, it&#x27;s gentle and cares for your hair. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works really good, smells ok. I use everyday and use on my little girls hair also. I get dry scalp and this took that away completely.</li>
    <li> My hair feels &#x27;&#x27;clean.&#x27;&#x27; Other shampooes use too many chemicals that strip the hair of natural oils. Go &#x27;&#x27;natural&#x27;&#x27;--you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo! Cleans well and gives hair plenty of body.</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked as well, if not better than any I have purchased off the store shelves. I had absolutely no problem getting a nice thick lather from a small dime size amount of this shampoo. A little really does go a long way!  It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair and left it feeling clean and smooth. Needless to say I&#x27;m hooked and will be returning for more.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo!  Doesn&#x27;t strip your hair color, leaves your hair shiny &amp; clean without drying your scalp. Also, doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes which means that it is very good for sensitive skin. Shampoos that burn your eyes cannot be good for your hair and scalp. Can be used daily which I like since I have very short hair that is colored once a month.</li>
    <li> My scalp is oily and my hair very dry and frizzy, this product doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp properly and makes my hair fall!! I won&#x27;t buy any product from this brand anymore</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered this product once already.  It is consistent and very nice in texture, packaging, and performance.  Company seems conscientious.</li>
    <li> The bottle was around 4 oz!@$%^&amp;*</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite shampoo! I like that it is made from all organic ingredients with no harsh chemicals. I have wavy hair, and this leaves it soft and shiny without weighing it down. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have always used salon shampoos because I felt they were better for my hair.  I never buy ones from regular stores.  Then I discovered Christina Moss Naturals.  I have all her products and recently ordered the shampoo and conditioner.  The first time I used the shampoo I was beyond amazed!!  My hair felt completely different than ever before.  I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how clean it felt!  The conditioner is also awesome.  These products are beyond amazing and I will NEVER use anything else again!!!!  And the follow up emails you get and the wonderful beauty tips are great.  Love these products and this company!!  I am a customer of Christina Moss Naturals for life!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I have not tried any conditioner they offer, nor do I know if they offer any (I&#x27;ve never noticed a difference while using conditioner and I keep my head shaved down to stubble most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;Because of that, my review is not for the restorative properties for hair, but for how gentle this shampoo is on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I received a diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis from my dermatologist about 6 years ago and had been struggling to find good products that wouldn&#x27;t cause the condition to flare up. Now, when I say flare up, I mean that I lose large parts of my skin and bleed from commercial shampoos. I actually just recently ran out of my last bottle and had to use some of the regular shampoo we keep around - about two hours after using it, I noticed I was already starting to peel. By the end of the day the side of my face was a wreck. I guarantee, just as with every time before, within two days of using this shampoo, my skin will be back on track to healing up and looking normal. Not because it&#x27;s mystical or magical, but because this shampoo does an excellent job of cleaning your skin while not stripping away all of its oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo that does right by your skin condition, look no further - just shy of a year of use and I have been in less pain with less embarrassment now than I have for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best shampoo I have ever used. It smells wonderful and you only use a very little amount. It gets your hair nice and clean and leaves it in very nice condition. I have had some spots from sun damage removed on my scalp so I wanted a shampoo that did not contain dangerous or irritating chemicals and dyes. I tried this based on the reviews and am very glad I did. I will be using it from now on. Thanks for making a safe and effective product that actually enhances my hair and scalp. I am a customer for life now!</li>
    <li> Does it come with conditionar</li>
    <li> I have finally found a shampoo that works!  Keeps my hair looking great and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this shampoo and he said it makes his hair shiny and very clean ! He loves it. Christina Moss thanks for creating all of these organic products for us. You are the best!</li>
    <li> EDIT:I had written that this shampoo worked for me, because on the first day my hair looked great, but by the second day my hair was itching so bad that i couldnt stand it. I have issues with my scalp and only one shampoo has ever gotten rid of the itching (Yes to carrots) but i wanted something more natural, and thought this shampoo was the answer. The first day my hair looked great, no dandruff, shiny and clean. But the next day my hair was so desperately itchy that i couldnt handle it. This has happened to me with every shampoo but yes to carrots. &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;BUT the price is insane, i know you only need a small amount, but the bottle is only 4 oz, which is incredibly small, so you are paying $12 for a little bottle. As much as i would love to keep buying this, i dont think i could afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison 4 oz &#x3D; 1/2 cup of shampoo 0_0</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first using this shampoo as I have used others that are &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; only to find that they have chemical preservatives in them and/or that they don&#x27;t clean my hair or lather well.  I was happy to find that this wasn&#x27;t the case with this shampoo. It lathers well and I shampoo with it twice in the shower. The first shampoo removes dirt and build up, the second shampoo lathers up much more and my hair feels great after. My hair is normally dry and I noticed that my hair feels much better after just a few uses. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  It lathers very well, and has no scent.  However, it is simply too expensive, so I would not order it regularly.</li>
    <li> Makes my scalp feel great and my hair soft when I use this shampoo this shampoo in the shower. This is the only shampoo I will buy from now on and its worth the price.</li>
    <li> After trying many organic hair products, I found Christina Moss shampoo and conditioner to be the best I have tried so far. As&lt;br /&gt;other reviewers have stated it works without leaving hair oily or weighted down. I use the conditioner as a Leave In because&lt;br /&gt;my hair is very damaged and this works fine. My hair is silky. Will reorder soon</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for in something safe to put on my head. Expensive but you need only a tiny bit at a time. And I get by okay with just one soaping and rinse.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo too drying for me. I have Hashimoto&#x27;s disease hence the reason for switching to organic products. Also I dye my hair with henna because I went grey early (age 35) so that probably contributes to the dryness. Ingredients are great however.</li>
    <li> I have a super sensitive skin and eczema on my face/head and finally found something which doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. Glad I found that product</li>
    <li> Not really any scent to this, which is perfectly fine.  Very light lather.  I&#x27;m used to using organic shampoos that don&#x27;t lather at all.  It&#x27;s actually kind of satisfying to have a bit of lather.  There&#x27;s a bit more with the 2nd shampooing than the first.  I usually do a deep conditioner of avocado, banana, egg yolk, and olive oil.  Other organic shampoos it can take up to 3 shampoos (2 applications each time!)  to remove enough of the oil.  This one gets the excess oil out the 1st shampooing.  It does feel as though it&#x27;s pretty much stripping the oil of my hair though.so you&#x27;ll definitely need to use the conditioner!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the real deal.  Completely free of any scent.  My hair (which is fine and shoulder length and beginning to gray) looks healthy and as if it has more volume.  My favorite part is the purity of the product.  Thank you for making a naturally simple shampoo that just simply works!</li>
    <li> Cleans hair but leaves it very dry!</li>
    <li> Love this product! The shampoo does lather, no scent. I have salon highlights. My colorist couldn&#x27;t believe how well my color held up. She only did minor touch ups to my roots after 5 weeks.. My hair feels wonderful! I will buy again! I recommend the companion conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for three tears on my thin hair and my hairdresser noticed the differences for the one week I used something else. I love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Seems to clean better as hair is left squeaky clean but itches profusely after a few weeks use.</li>
    <li> Works great! No Chemicals and does not weigh down fine hair. There are no fragrances, additives or preservatives in this shampoo.p</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a  month now and really like it. I like that it is natural with no damaging chemicals. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Unlike other organic, herbal shampoos I have tried, Christina Moss Naturals actually lathers. It smells great and, most importantly, cleans my hair and scalp. It&#x27;s the only shampoo I use now on my shoulder-length hair and have been spreading the word to friends as I pass on bottles for them to try. I use no more than the former brand name shampoos in order to lather. Makes me feel good that it&#x27;s environmentally friendly and that the ingredients are all-natural.</li>
    <li> Highly concentrated, so a little bit goes a long way. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s organic and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic product! I have curly, dry hair, which needs lots of nourishment, and this natural product finally does the trick (I tried many before...): it cleans and nourishes (especially when combined with the conditioner). It&#x27;s too bad that Christina Moss Naturals products are available only in the US. I have friends in Europe who would love to purchase the hair and face care products. They got hooked when they visited me and tried them all: shampoo, conditioner, facial wash, moisturizer --- each of exceptional quality!!</li>
    <li> Expensive for the amount you get. The but nothing special.</li>
    <li> Customer service is as good as the shampoo and conditioner. I have rosacea and these do not cause it to flare up. They smell great, hair has lots of body. I tried a lot of products before finally finding these!</li>
    <li> At first my hair went kind of haywire, but after all the product buildup was removed it settled down and is now soft as a cloud, shiny, and my natural wave has come back.  For me the only down side is that it has no smell.  Perhaps some natural essential oils could be used as an alternative to the unscented.  That said, I will be using this product regularly.</li>
    <li> I think it helps the scalp itch but makes fine, thin hair harder to style.  It seems to reduce body.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use this product. It has all natural ingredients and it leaves my hair looking good after shampooing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are terrible. I should have listened to the reviewers who said so. My hair was soft but looked and felt awful. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The best  organic  shampo.</li>
    <li> i like to buy a product for the company&#x27;s quality as well; not just the product, and i am very pleased with the team of workers, (based on their emails i have received), as well as their shampoo. It works very well, does not destroy the sensitive ph balance of my scalp and my hair still feels soft but not overly oily. I know that oil is important to my body and stripping it, is dangerous. I do like to add my young living oils, which i also sell, to my bottle of shampoo and am very grateful that this product handles it so well.&lt;br /&gt;I was also informed that they are making the bottles bigger, which i think is a great idea. i look forward to purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product has degraded after they introduced the new bottle and size (8 oz). The product is more watery than before. Hence you are paying more price now for about the same quantity (4 oz) that was offered before.</li>
    <li> My hair feels good 2 days after washing.  Not oily at all.</li>
    <li> After months of searching for a natural shampoo and trying a few homemade formulas, I have found &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34;  This shampoo has a nice lather and leaves my hair feeling soft and looking shiny.  And, for someone who is sensitive to odors, this shampoo is great since it has no odor at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slowly switching to all natural products... At first I tried Dr. Bronner&#x27;s magic soap on my hair, but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling very soft, so I went on a search for a product that was intended to be used as a shampoo. Both are essentially made of saponified oils, but I&#x27;m having better luck with this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t have the lather or scent that I&#x27;m used to from commercial shampoos, but it does a good job cleaning my hair. A small amount of it goes a long way. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I have terrible allergies to most shampoo ingredients, and this wash was a godsend. The first 2 washes with it, it make my hair a weird texture that I wasn&#x27;t really fan of. I came to the reviews page to see if I wasn&#x27;t using enough and noticed that some people suggested washing with it twice. I tried that the next shower and my hair looked and felt wonderful afterward. I guess it all depends on your hair type, but this wash is really great if you use enough!</li>
    <li> I recently order the Christina Moss shampoo and conditioner and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I have permed and color treated hair. My hair is shinny and healthy looking after the 1st use, will never use any thing else on my hair. Because of this product I will buy the facial cleanser</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo as I know it is natural and good for me in the long run.  It does feel like it has too much soap as it leaves the hair really dry almost as if you are striping all the natural oils from your hair but it must be ok and doing the job it promises to do as my hair does look healthier.</li>
    <li> Excellent all natural shampoo!!  Christina Moss Naturals has produced a wonderful shampoo which leaves hair clean and healthy.  You don&#x27;t need much, so a little goes a long way.  I follow up the Christina Moss organic hair conditioner-a perfect combination!  My hair is soft, clean and nicely conditioned.  I highly recommend both these products for a healthier head of hair with no harmful chemicals.  The company is awesome providing all the information you need to use these products properly.  Wonderful products!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter in law  Casey Clarke as a gift, here is what she says  &amp;#34; A very little went a loooong way. I especially like that it creates a very silky lather, that the scents are essential oils and fade once rinsed( I don&#x27;t  like to smell my hair products through out the day )and that it left my hair feeling clean not stripped of natural moisture. I truly value products that have an ingredient list I can understand. Thank you. 5 stars for sure.</li>
    <li> Very good clear shampoo cleans well and with nothing toxic.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. My daughter has extremely sensitive skin and the shampoo she was using made her skin breakout horribly. I knew I had to find something more gentle that still would leave her hair looking clean. I found it in this product! I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review!&lt;br /&gt;Yay for natural hair care that doesn&#x27;t have ARGAN OIL! This is extremely refreshing since it seriously breaks me out! I mean everywhere!!! Also, I recently dyed my hair red so I was skeptical to use anything without red dyes in it but I&#x27;ve actually noticed that it works perfectly fine and doesn&#x27;t make my hair bleed anymore than my color shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Gets my hair clean without over cleaning it and drying it out.</li>
    <li> i have tried this for a week now. My hair is fine and wavy. I do not dye my hair so its very healthy. I had to give it a week to give a honest review since i read so many good reviews about it. Lets start with the smell, it doesnt really have one which is a plus. It is a little runny but a little lathers well. After rinsing my hair it feels like i washed my hair with soap. Very drying and leaves a residue. I used the conditioner and it felt better. I dont recommended not using conditioner. The plus side very little hair felt out when i use it. The negative it now that i have used it for a week i have noticed my ends are drying and they look frayed like a have static separated my hair. I have stopped using this stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter with sensitive skin. She has an irritable skin which reddens even with some &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; &amp;#34;non-chemical&amp;#34; shampoo. We&#x27;ve had no problems with this product. Just wish they came in larger quantities.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo I always come back to it.  Noticed dry scalp with all the others I have tried but this moisturizes without leaving your hair feeling greasy.  I have fine hair and I use it daily with no drying, greasiness or flaking.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like this product. it states it&#x27;s organic but seems like rash. i am using it since 15 days and my hair getting more weak, dry, rough, more dandruff than before. after every wash it leave my hair dry and break in splits. i am having more dandruff than before and more hair loos.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. I only use clean products and its ingredients fit the bill. However, even with quite a bit of its companion conditioner, it left my hair very staticky, lots and lots of flyaways (my hair is very long), and unmanageable. I was looking for an alternative to the Pristine Beauty products, because I don&#x27;t like the pump, but unfortunately, this is not for me...</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural shampoo &amp; conditioner for about 2 years now with no success.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo didn&#x27;t work so well with my hair (course and lots of it).  I had to use what I consider to be a lot of shampoo to get my hair clean.  3 wash &amp; rinse cycles each shower (every morning).  I am used to washing my hair twice when I skip a day, but not 3x every morning. Also the consistency of the shampoo is so runny that it drips off the end of my finger. That causes me to waste a fair amount b/c it runs off the side of my hand &amp; down my arm as I try to get the shampoo to my head.</li>
    <li> Organic,but all oil, does not clean</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! I love it, my hair loves it, can&#x27;t say enough good about this shampoo.  My hair looks and feels so amazing that people comment on it. And I feel great using this organic &amp; natural product.  I also use the face wash and love it too.  It is well worth the money.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Use it on myself and the kids. Very gently shampoo for the whole family!</li>
    <li> Due to chemo, I was looking for mild, organic products to gently cleanse and soothe my scalp while the hair grows back. These products more than met my expectations, and have taken good care of my skin and hair.  I&#x27;m clear now and will be ordering these again, especially once the hair gets long enough to use more of the product ^.^</li>
    <li> Really amazing shampoo! I have used several natural detergent free shampoos but always went back to kiehl&#x27;s tea tree oil shampoo (which isn&#x27;t detergent free, but is the most compatible with my skin), but this shampoo is a game changer. It feels really good for the skin because it doesn&#x27;t strip any oils from the face (my complexion actually looks healthier in just a week), and it cleans the scalp and hair really really well. It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or sticky feeling like many non-detergent shampoos do. It does lather, but not like the typical large bubbly lather. I was skeptical at first, but my hair feels cleaner, softer, and less greasy than other shampoos, requiring less often washing. Also, I found the value to be great, a little goes a long way, and I lather twice with small amounts, which cleans better than if you lather once with a large amount (it&#x27;s science).</li>
    <li> A concentrated shampoo that is exactly what I was looking for:  a natural ingredients shampoo that leaves my hair easy to style.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a week now and love it! My hair smells good and is shiny and soft. I highlight my hair and this shampoo so far has not faded the color. I also love that is 100% organic. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Okay its good but not really for moderate oily scalp. It will leave hair flat esp curly hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still have not found a natural product that will work for my oily scalp and not leave my  curly hair looking flat and without shape.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It gets my hair clean with one lather. It smell good and my hair feels and looks so healthy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I also use Christina Moss Naturals conditioner and my hair is so gorgeous and soft--happier than it&#x27;s ever been. I am extremely conscious about the products I put on my body and I was so happy to discover this line of products--highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice when I first began using this shampoo that the instructions say to shampoo twice. I would advise not skimping on time/product and really doing it twice--it makes such a huge difference. And the conditioner goes such a long way, it makes up for having to use extra shampoo with each wash. Although, if you wash your hair daily (you shouldn&#x27;t), you may be fine with just one shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is organic and gets away from all the toxins found in regular shampoo which is great because even just shampooing stuff does enter your bloodstream and there are really bad toxins in most regular shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is this is a very small bottle so I hope in time they can get cost down and increase the size of their bottles and that is why I docked them one star.</li>
