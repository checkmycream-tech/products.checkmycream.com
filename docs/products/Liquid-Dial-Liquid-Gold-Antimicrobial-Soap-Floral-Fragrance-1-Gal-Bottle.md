<li> I also like that I don&#x27;t have to hunt it down and drag it through the store.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think a gallon would go very far, but when I refilled the dispenser, the soap was very thick.</li>
<li> This product works well to keep bacterial levels down on a person&#x27;s skin.  </li>
<li> We refill all our little containers and save a bundle.</li>
<li> I was a little leary about buying the dial soap, but after reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find just plain liquid Dial soap</li>
<li> Can hardly find the small bottles anywhere anymore</li>
<li> The soap is thick too.    </li>
<li> Expensive for 1 gallon.</li>
<li> washing my hands wouldn&#x27;t be so tedious when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>

    <li> This product works well to keep bacterial levels down on a person&#x27;s skin.  It can be used as an all-over body wash to good avail.  A small amount sudses up easily, so that a little goes a long way.  I need to keep my bacteria levels down due to a compromised immune system -- and this product does the job very well.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to consistently stay free of excessive bacteria.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I cannot find Dial Gold in stores anymore. I used to buy the big jugs (i.e. 64 oz) but Walmart and Target does seem to carry it anymore (don&#x27;t know why). It&#x27;s more economical to buy this 1 Gallon Refill verus buying 2 64 oz jugs. I think I pay more though.    Target does sell Dial Gold but it&#x27;s in these Eco-Smart Refill packages, I don&#x27;t like it. I rather buy 1 big bottle.    Dial Gold has a light scent, not distinguishable to any fruits or flavors. The soap is thick too.    I enjoy using Dial Gold and will continue to purchase this on Amazon with this supplier.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and the price is perfect. If you tried to buy the same amount in individual bottles it would cost 3 times the price.</li>
    <li> We have used Dial Liquid Gold Soap for years. As with other reviewers,  lately we cannot find it in any store so was very happy to find it on here! Refilling the bottles from the large  1 gallon jug is a little more trouble, but it&#x27;s still worth having the product we want. The price for the Gallon seems fair enough and the order was shipped and arrived super fast! Sometimes one has to wonder why popular products become harder and harder to find. Thanks to Amazon- we still have a resource for this!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find good soap anywhere</li>
    <li> SO GLAD to find this on Amazon!! Can hardly find the small bottles anywhere anymore and this was great to be able to purchase and refill all my handsoap bottles with! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Thought I was purchasing a case. Expensive for 1 gallon.</li>
    <li> Dial soap is the most highly recommended soap for anti-bacterial and general use. Sam&#x27;s Club stopped carrying Dial soap refills and started pushing Wal Mart&#x27;s brand, same as they did with Glad Bag sandwich bags. So, we go to Amazon and get both now for about the same price and delivered instead of working your way through a distant warehouse with a pack of strangers as surly about being treated like cattle as we are. Turns out that the Dial Antimicrobial works just like the other type with the added benefit that &#x27;antimicrobial&#x27; also addresses filth problems like fungus and parasitic microbes. Just a few more items of what we prefer delivered for about the same price and we can tell Sam&#x27;s Wally-World Club to kiss it right in the middle. PBBBT!!</li>
    <li> It is the same Dial Gold Soap that you can buy in most stores, It is just in a gallon size. Saves you $$ to refill them. Stores stop selling them due it&#x27;s size and profit level.</li>
    <li> The soap is very soapy!</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a GOOD antibacterial soap!  My kids are always washing hand and having this large refill is cheaper than always buying the small dispensers!</li>
    <li> Great refile size,and a great product</li>
    <li> This foaming hand soap does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a refill for our empty ZEP foam pumps. I was a little leary about buying the dial soap, but after reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its better than I expected. I didn&#x27;t think a gallon would go very far, but when I refilled the dispenser, the soap was very thick. After I added 3 parts water to 1 part soap, the dispenser provided a nice lather that works great.</li>
    <li> I love liquid dial.  It&#x27;s: convenient, not messy, cuts the dirt and grease, and it leaves no noticeable film (unlike the bar soaps).    The gallon refills are good for about 17 reloads of the hand dispenser.  One recommendation, though:  Buy a [[ASIN:B00061MPFG pump for the gallon bottle too]].  It makes refilling the hand dispenser so much easier.</li>
    <li> We have not been able to find the Dial refill antimicrobial soap in the local stores grocery stores but have find them in staples so may not be ordering these any more.</li>
    <li> glad to be able to buy this by the gallon.  We refill all our little containers and save a bundle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find just plain liquid Dial soap and I never would think to look at an office supply source, but they came through.  The bottle was well wrapped and shipped quickly.  We are smelling good again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and have been using it as my shower soap for many years. The antibacterial quality to it is great and I enjoy the pleasant scent which works for both women and men. Buying it in the gallon jug makes it a very economical purchase...a big plus!</li>
    <li> I love having this large Bottle and being able to refill all of my soap dispensers. I also like that I don&#x27;t have to hunt it down and drag it through the store. It just shows up at my front door.  Great soap too.</li>
    <li> Great value for a great brand</li>
    <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, there was no foil seal when i took the plastic cap off.</li>
    <li> Everyone should be bathing and washing in this Dial. It kills bacteria, helps to heal wounds quickly and superb for skin issues. It is the best!</li>
    <li> Big advocate of Dial ab.  Never studied it or compared it clinically, but recommend it to all and scrub it on every scrape. Don&#x27;t want no bacteria here.</li>
    <li> I buy this product, because you cant find the big bags in stores anymore. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the regular dial soap as me.</li>
    <li> BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT PLEASE RESEARCH THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF ITS MAIN INGREDIENT TRICLOSAN &amp; NEW SCIENCE STUDIES.&lt;br /&gt; [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; [...]</li>
    <li> We have used Dial liquid soap for years. Buying by the gallon is so much cheaper than buying by small quantities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for Liquid Dial Gold Soap but no one in my area carries it anymore. My whole family loves it and with a family of 5, we go through it fast. SO HAPPY when I found it right here on Amazon and I was even happier when I received my order only 2 days later and it was exactly what I wanted. 5 Star Transaction!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for several years and find it to be more than adequate. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This will last me forever!!!!! I use it to clean all of my piercings like instructed to do so by my piercer!</li>
    <li> love this soap getting harder to find locally for me.</li>
    <li> Good quality and quantity.</li>
    <li> Great !! Using as replacement for shower gel. Works great.</li>
    <li> Ah, yes! My beloved Dial Gold. Plenty of this wonderful, fresh-smelling soap to wash my hands and to shower with. Helps keep my skin from breaking out, too! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is doing the trick. My cellulitis has cleared up. (Not a bad case of cellulitis)</li>
    <li> I buy this frequently, fast delivery !!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Dial Gold.  My wife makes fun of me for having a prefence of soap, but whatever.  So I decided to buy in bulk and save.  I just refill my stainless dispensers at home for less money.  Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> The product was good and the shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again and again.  Best soap ever and great price.  Smells like Dial always did and I have nothing but great things to say about  it.  As a matter of fact, I had a guest that liked it so much that I gave hm a bottle to take home.</li>
    <li> I got this to fill my [[ASIN:B004MDM66C Impact 9330 White 30 Oz. ClearVu Encore Soap Dispenser]]&lt;br /&gt;so washing my hands wouldn&#x27;t be so tedious when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I have been buying  the gallon size for a couple of years now good value and sent quick too, will buy again...</li>
