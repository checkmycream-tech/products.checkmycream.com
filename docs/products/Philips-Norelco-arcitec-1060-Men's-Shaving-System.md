      <li>I am very pleased and will recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s very pleased.</li>
      <li>I was able to return the Arcitec and am really happy with this Braun 9595 model.</li>
      <li>I upgraded to the 7140, and was VERY pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Neither has a good sideburn trimmer, althought the 7140 is better (but I&#x27;ve never had an electric that does a good job on that</li>
      <li>I have found it to give me the best and most comfortable shave of any device that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I hope to be using this shaver for years to come.  </li>
      <li>Nice design and all, but</li>
      <li>My face also had a nice sheen when I was done, unlike the road rash from the Braun.</li>
      <li>as I was-, then buy it on your own risk.    </li>
      <li>Need some patience to decide how to clean it, but then all is great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>However, being a first time owner I am happy with my purchase/investment.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s attractive, it works smoothly, it chomps through my relatively light stubble in a hurry, it holds a charge for more than a week at a time...</li>
      <li>The over all feel of the shaver is very cheap.</li>
      <li>More area and very smooth.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I like most about it.</li>
      <li>Although the shaving closeness does not match that of a Gillette razor 100% (and perhaps no electric shaver ever will), the results are considered stunning and revolutionary for an electric razor.</li>
      <li>Initially I wasn&#x27;t very impressed by the closeness of the shave.</li>
      <li>I received this shaver as a welcome and much needed birthday gift.  </li>
      <li>The shave is much more uniform than that of the Braun</li>
      <li>I thought I would give an elec razor one more chance.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Remmington and Braun, and I personally have found that Norelco&#x27;s \\&quot;life and cut\\&quot; shavers are the best.  </li>
      <li>Blades have gotten SO much better since 20 years ago.</li>
      <li>I have had Norelco electric razor products for many years.</li>
      <li>No matter how many times I go over the area of my neck, the razor won&#x27;t trim those hairs.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more convenient to use and it trims better.  </li>
      <li>shave.$20 Pocket Braun is so much better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of shaves that I get.</li>
      <li>I had the Norelco 6885XL which was a must better heavier shaver.    </li>
      <li>I like the design of the handle much better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thinner, longer, and feels better in your hand.  </li>
      <li>If it was quieter and it cut better</li>
      <li>I have used Norelco shavers for 40+ years, and I love the look and weight of this shaver.    </li>
      <li>All in all, a shaver I am still enjoying after 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>and I do feel like I have more control of this razor on my face and neck.   </li>
      <li>- I guess I just wanted to give it even more time</li>
      <li>Good right out of the boxes.  </li>
      <li>Very easy and smooth.</li>
      <li>Overall a very good razor, I am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I, like many others I presume, have been on a lifelong search for the perfect electric shaver.   </li>
      <li>Overall it is a very good razor.</li>
      <li>They provide a good, close shave, and are pretty comfortable.  </li>
      <li>it is ergonomic and fits my hand and face easily.</li>
      <li>It is fine -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 8-years and the charger and razor still work fine.  </li>
      <li>and it is still charged and shaving fine.</li>
      <li>but once I used it I found that head is detachable and Trimmer works fine.</li>
      <li>it moves easily around my chin and nose and is easy to clean under the faucet.  </li>
      <li>But I encourage buyers not to forget the easy return policy and hold on to your original sales receipt to keep all options available.</li>
      <li>There are huge price variances for this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to clean with running water or the supplied brush.</li>
      <li>This primarily occurs around my neck and forces me to use the built in trimmer to cut them.  </li>
      <li>To start out-the feel of the shaver was really cheap and light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s built solid, has a great grip, and shaves as close as one gets to razorblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He loves the close, smooth shave and the ease of cleaning the shaver head.</li>
      <li>- Easy to clean   - LED display is convenient</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to handle and use.  </li>
      <li>Valentine\\&quot; and here is what he said: \\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco Arcitec for about a week and truly enjoy the experience.  </li>
      <li>and I get just as smooth a shave as with a blade,and</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean and charge.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a quality machine that does what it is supposed to do: provide a close, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>I have another 40+ days and still may return the 1060, but every time I use it I continue to enjoy it   3</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband was using a less expensive Norelco shaver which he liked but felt that he wanted a closer shave that would last longer throughout the work-day.  He would occasionally take the shaver with him to work to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; his shave.  As bad (or good) luck would have it his car was broken into on one of those days and his shaver was stolen along with other items.  Forced to buy another shaver he upgraded to the 1060 and LOVES it.  He loves the close, smooth shave and the ease of cleaning the shaver head.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for years.   This arcitec 1060 is undoubtedly the best I have been exposed to.  Very close shave each time.  Only negative is the he shaving heads must be washed after each use but that does not override the quality of the shaver.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> The product look, style, features, travel charger, stand, and weight  are all great! However the shave is not as close a it should be. My old panasonic 2 blade system cuts a closer shave in half the time. The shaver also does not do well if you have to shave a shorter beard growth, like a second shave later in the same day. It takes a very long time to get a close acceptable shave.</li>
    <li> My Arcitec 1060 gave great shaves from the start.  I have a very tough beard, and this shaver gives a very close and comfortable shave. This is my fourth Norelco shaver (over the last 30 years), and it is definitely the best.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased teh ARcitec product to replace my Norelco XL shaver.  I have used Norelco electric razors for over 20 years and find that the arcitec razor is the worst performing electric razor that i have ever used.  In particular, shaving around the neck area has been the most difficult area for the razor to take care of.  I would not recommend this razor to anyone</li>
    <li> I had an old (5 yrs) Norelco that worked quiet well, but I was deligthed when saw the arcitec´s design. Definitely the shaving experience is not even half as good as my old Norelco, although the battery, cleaning system, and display is superior.   I hope it gets better as my face gets used to this new system.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past handful of months and I&#x27;m just consistently disappointed at the shave time length. I&#x27;m a weekly shaver and so I let it grow to a significant length and I&#x27;m finding that this razor more often than not misses many splotchy patches of hair and invariably leaves these singular hairs that I just have to break down and pull out the clippers to shave off a bit before I hit it with the blades hoping that they will finally catch and remove the hair. My shave time has just about doubled using this clumsy device, its slow and it leaves a mess all over the counter. Those catch regions behind the blades they&#x27;re pretty pathetic for shaving beard lengths on the order of a week. I always have fall off all over the region of my sink under my chin, and the trimmings are all over my hands too, it&#x27;s annoying. This product is way too expensive for this kind of performance. This model was supposed to be an upgrade from this very basic Norelco model I had with single blade tracks, but even that one did a quicker job albeit with a bit more razor burn, but at least I could impress it into my skin to force a closer shave. This model won&#x27;t let you do anything comparable because the pressure will just get wasted in the pivoting head mechanism. I&#x27;m overall dissatisfied with this product and I wish instead I bought that Braun razor instead that I was comparing this to.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for ages. I bought this model before reading any of the reviews posted here and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best Norelco shaver yet. It&#x27;s built solid, has a great grip, and shaves as close as one gets to razorblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best feature is maneuverability of the head that shaves the toughest areas, especially under the chin and the upper neck area. I used to have a standard razor for this but no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slick stand and a tough carrying case. It&#x27;s 20 or so shaves per charge gives you at least two weeks without having to recharge which is great for those of who travel much. I got the 1060 instead of the 1090 since the price-performance point was much higher for the 1060: for $45 less, I can live with a bar graph for battery level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind that I have a tougher skin and a heavy beard. I use the shaver wet with a bit of soap on my face.</li>
    <li> From someone who has been a loyal Philishave customer for more than 10 years, I think this is one of the worst purchase decisions I have made yet. I was taken away with the new space design. I was hesitant because of the price tag, and because I knew a machine this new would be a risk to buy since it hasn&#x27;t been tested as extensively as earlier models yet.    The worst electric razor shaving experience I have ever had, period. I basically have to keep going over the same spot over and over to get a an &#x27;average&#x27; clean shave, it now takes me almost 10 minutes to shave. With earlier, less tech, models it used to take me 2-3 minutes to get the same shave. And if I leave my beard unshaved a few days, with the hairs a tad bit longer at around 2mm, it keeps missing the longer ones and i have to go over them again and again, and probably get into trim mode, trim them, and go back shave them normally when they are shorter! This never happened with earlier (much less expensive) models.    What ticked me off, was how fragile this thing is. Yesterday I wasn&#x27;t careful enough handling it, it slipped my hand and fell onto the ground. Since it fell on a thick carpet, I thought the fall had been greatly cushioned. However, to my surprise, it is not working as it should anymore. Normal shaving mode makes a very loud noise and shaves even worse than before, and Trim mode does not work at all anymore.    Bottom line: You are better off buying one of the better shaving, more rugged, and least expensive models than this one. But if you&#x27;re already swept your feet with the \\&quot;space looking\\&quot; tech - as I was-, then buy it on your own risk.    Edit: I think this review goes for the whole Arcitec range, since they all are the same at the core.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement of my 8 year old Norelco. So far it&#x27;s been more than three weeks and it is still charged and shaving fine. I especially like the hard travel case. You have to remember to empty it after each shave or the red light comes on. much smaller space than the old one. It sans to always rinse with hot water, but I&#x27;m only doing that every few days since I don&#x27;t feel like running water till hot gets to the bathroom in the morning after swimming.    There are huge price variances for this. Amazon showed them all and I got it at about half price.</li>
    <li> Had this shaver for about a year. My old $40 braun is waaay better than this one. The Norleco shaves terribly and leaves patches of hair. And now on top of all this it was completly dead this morning. Does not work at all! And like some other people have said it does leave you with razor burn and still doesn&#x27;t shave close enough for your skin to feel smooth.   WARNING!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS AWEFUL!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I ignored the negative reviews and purchased this - this shaver works great for me.  I had been using a Panasonic 8228, which always nicked my adam&#x27;s apple and which required me to shave wet first, then dry in order to get my jawline done.  The Arcitec shaves me perfectly in a few minutes with zero irritation.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced another norelco which is 8 - 10 years old.  This one does a very nice job.  The charging station has suction cups on the bottom so that it does not slip from where you put it.  Very nice!</li>
    <li> Good machine, comfortable and easy to clean.  not very powerful in terms of speed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s attractive, it works smoothly, it chomps through my relatively light stubble in a hurry, it holds a charge for more than a week at a time... basically it&#x27;s just solid and works.    The drawbacks:     1) It doesn&#x27;t fully and completely get all the wispy hairs on my neck down to skin level, but then I&#x27;ve never found an electric razor that did. You can&#x27;t really see them, and if I want to look super extra spiffy some day, I have a fixed-blade mach 5 that takes them out in a minute and a half... And because that razor only gets used occasionally and on the very light / sparse hair that the Norelco leaves behind, the shave is very easy to do, friendly to my skin, and its blades are basically lasting forever.    2) The charger plugs into its base and its carrying case (which is a nifty one, BTW), not the razor itself. So you can&#x27;t use it while charging. In the event you ran completely out of power, this would be a problem... Though not an enormous one, as the battery lasts a long long time, has an indicator that tells you where it&#x27;s at so you don&#x27;t get surprised, and in the worst case scenario it charges really very fast (maybe an hour). Plus, I guess, in an absolute emergency I have the fixed-blade razor that isn&#x27;t as convenient, but can do the job in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco products for over 30 years.  This is the first loser.  My wife gave it to me for Christmas to replace a ten year old traditional Norelco.  I tried to like it for her sake.  I have gone back to the ten year old razor.  The trimmer is useless, it is difficult to use, and it takes at least twice as long to get a decent shave.  Loser.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver as a gift for my boyfriend. It&#x27;s a nice looking shaver and works wonderfully.  I received it within a few days of ordering.  He&#x27;s very pleased.</li>
    <li> This one is just not worth the money. The concept is great, but after a month or so I noticed my father&#x27;s shave wasn&#x27;t as close. You cannot really clean this razor head.  You cannot take the blades apart to clean them as in many of the older  Norelco models.  The whiskers then clog up in the razor head.  I have found myself using a toothbrush handle and tapped on the razor head repeditively to losen things up and I could not believe the debris that continues to come out of the razor head even after the daily cleaning.  We replaced the head after 6 months and have found ourself repeating the same ritual.  I will switch back to our old razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a good shave but does pull once in awhile. That was he part that disappointed me. Left a good burning sensasion. It is easy to clean and charge. The charging/storage case is pretty cool. I wish there was a place to save the brush so things don&#x27;t get seperated and a small travel case maybe for it. I like it because it does flow pretty good over your face when shaving and stays pretty smooth.</li>
    <li> This is different from other Arctic shavers because it has 3 blades in each blade. More area and very smooth. I am shaving electrically since last 3 years, no more regular shavers. Very easy and smooth. This shaver is much better than any other I have used previously.    I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve owned this razor for over a year now and I think I&#x27;m going back to my old Norelco 9160XL (similar to the current 8200 series).  What don&#x27;t I like about the Arcitec model?      1) It&#x27;s loud--loud enough for my wife to complain in the  morning when she is still trying to sleep.  It is much louder than my 9160 which is nearly silent.   2) I don&#x27;t think this new HQ10 blade set cuts as well as the HQ9 set.  I believe I get a closer cut from the old razor, and with less effort.  I find it easier to shave my neck with the 9160, which is exactly what I had hoped the Arcitec would do better, but it doesn&#x27;t.  3) I don&#x27;t like the hair trimmer design.  The design on the 9160 (and current 8200) is much better.  It&#x27;s much more convenient to use and it trims better.  4) It&#x27;s nearly double the price of the 8200 series.    What do I like about the Arcitec?      1) I like the design of the handle much better.  It&#x27;s thinner, longer, and feels better in your hand.  2) I can get about 1 month of daily use out of a single charge.      If it was quieter and it cut better I&#x27;d highly recommend it; but it doesn&#x27;t.  If I had to purchase a new razor today I&#x27;d buy the 8240. By the way, I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for decades.  I&#x27;ve not had any problem whatsoever with my razors since they moved away from NiCad batteries (at least 5 years ago).  The old razors batteries used to die and they were not replaceable, so you&#x27;d have to throw the whole thing away.  But this is now very much a thing of the past.  I highly recommend the brand.</li>
    <li> The shave seems faster than my old Norelco, could just be the new blades and not the \\&quot;improved technology\\&quot;. I like the ability to clean with hot water ... I don&#x27;t like the smaller beard trimmer .. it is awkward when trying to trim all sides of sideburns.</li>
    <li> Overall I am satisfied with my purchase, but the arcitec leaves a bit to be desired for sure.      The razor works great on my cheeks, upper lip and also my chin but does poorly on my lower neck.  No matter how many times I go over the area of my neck, the razor won&#x27;t trim those hairs.  I have to get out a blade to shave them.    For the price I paid, I expected more.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s still a good shaver otherwise.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco shavers but I was apprehensive because of the new design. I am very pleased and will recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good right out of the boxes.  Need some patience to decide how to clean it, but then all is great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned lots of shavers in my lifetime from a Remington I got as a gift as a teen, and two Norelco&#x27;s, one Braun. I have to say this Norelco Arcitec 1060 is the first electric shaver that works as advertised. I get a razor close shave even in the neck region.   As for cleaning after each use it takes all of 30 seconds under the faucet.   I&#x27;M very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Arcitec 1060 provides a smooth, clean shave.  One of, if not the best shavers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Nice design and all, but it dont do the job, I have had better shavers for lot&#x27;s less money.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this is a decent shaver - and that I am a fan of Norelco shavers.  I&#x27;ve used Remmington and Braun, and I personally have found that Norelco&#x27;s \\&quot;life and cut\\&quot; shavers are the best.  They provide a good, close shave, and are pretty comfortable.  That being said, I had one of the old 4000 models (couldn&#x27;t tell you which one) for years, and it did pretty well.  I upgraded to the 7140, and was VERY pleased with it.  When the blades started to get dull, I thought - maybe just once I&#x27;ll go for it and buy the top of the line.  So, I went with the arcitec.  It is disappointing for the price.  It is fine - but I actually think the 7140 was more comfortable.  At first, the arcitec seemed pretty good.  However, I then realized it was probably just because it had new blades.  I have now been using it for about 5 months - and I find it takes longer than it used to with my old 7140.  This morning, I pulled out the 7140, and was amazed.   Using it, even with the old blades, it took less time, and was more comfortable than the arcitec.  I guess I&#x27;ve learned my lesson - price does not always matter.  The arcitec is simplymore hi-fi - but I actually get a better, closer, faster, and more comfortable shave with the 7140.  Both are easy to clean (7140 slightly easier because I don&#x27;t have to pop open each head separately).  Neither has a good sideburn trimmer, althought the 7140 is better (but I&#x27;ve never had an electric that does a good job on that - I just use a straight blade on that about once a week).  The arcitec does hold a charge very well - one charge will last me nearly two weeks (I shave for a good 5-7 minutes because I have a tough beard).    Overall, again, just a pretty good shaver.  Nothing wrong with it - but I would have been far better off just getting replacement heads for my 7140.  (Incidentally, I know Norelco would have given me my money back within 60 days, and I really wish I would ahve done that - I guess I just wanted to give it even more time so see if my face adjusted - too late now - so I&#x27;ll buy some replacement heads for my 7140 and just go back to that one).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of bad reviews on this shaver and I just don&#x27;t understand why it gets such bad marks.  Granted, I&#x27;ve never shaved with any other brand than a Norelco, so I may not have a lot to compare it to.  For the past eight years, I shaved with a Norelco Advantage/Cool skin. I wasn&#x27;t in the market to purchase a new shaver, as I loved my cool skin, but after 8 years, it began to come apart (literally).  I received this shaver as a welcome and much needed birthday gift.  So far it has lived up to my expectations; its precise in the way it cuts the facial hair and it does provide a closer shave on the neck region than my Advantage/Cool Skin model.  In order to avoid any razor burn, I dab some Lectric Shave on my face about 30 seconds prior to shaving (great advice for any of you experiencing razor burn).  Unlike the Advantage/Cool skin model, the hairs fall into the blade area neatly, which makes cleaning a breeze.  All it takes is some lightly running hot water and about 30 seconds.  The arcitec 1060 also has a very powerful charger; I&#x27;ve had it now for over two weeks and have only had to charge it once.      Yes, this is an expensive razor and it may not be worth the price you pay for it, but getting it as a gift I can honestly say that I hope to be using this shaver for years to come.  It&#x27;s a quality machine that does what it is supposed to do: provide a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Norelco Arcitec 1060 for a little over 6 months now and I continue to enjoy this shaver.  The battery lasts an extremely long time and I rarely have to charge it.  The carrying case and stand-up charger/holder both look great and function perfectly.  I haven&#x27;t owned an electric shaver previous to this model so I cannot fairly compare.  However, being a first time owner I am happy with my purchase/investment.    The only area of opportunity for me is that despite 3 different sized shaving heads there are many hairs the blade is unable to catch and cut.  This primarily occurs around my neck and forces me to use the built in trimmer to cut them.  I would say this razor cuts 98% - 99% of what I need it to do and the many pros outweigh this small inconvenience.    Other notable pros :    - Easy to clean   - LED display is convenient</li>
    <li> I like it , a good price .  I Brought it for my Dad for his Bday and he like it very much.</li>
    <li> I, like many others I presume, have been on a lifelong search for the perfect electric shaver.   Being interested in saving time in the morning and not risking the effort to shave daily with a bladed razor, I have long preferred an electric shaver and have tried everything from Remington to Braun to Norelco.  The Norelco tripleheader technology was what I always came back to.     I recently purchased the Norelco Arcitec 1060 razor after reading of its improvements and seeing its new design.  It is still a triple header but the floating heads now sit on a swiveling ball-type joint that allows easier and presumably closer access to one&#x27;s beard in many of the former \\&quot;difficult-to-reach areas\\&quot;.   It comes with a charging stand and a travel sphere that also doubles as a charger.    After several weeks, I find my shaves are closer than with my older Norelco 8170XL Norelcoseries model and I do feel like I have more control of this razor on my face and neck.   It is powerful enough to get the job done with just a few circular strokes while holding the skin stretched.    I would have preferred a model with a direct cord capability but alas, this model must be recharged to be used: obviously, when the battery goes, you will not be able to run the razor with an electrical cord while waiting for a new battery.      Also, since the floating heads sit on the flexible pedestal, there is little collection room for cut whiskers to be stored; indeed, each head needs to be opened and cleaned after every couple of shaves.  Of interest is the claim that the heads can be cleaned by just rinsing them--although I have yet to bring myself to try this.  There is a symbol on the front that points out when the heads need to be cleaned (rinsed) and symbols for battery life.  All in all, a shaver I am still enjoying after 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I receive this shaver as a gift.  I have found it to give me the best and most comfortable shave of any device that I have ever used.  I do have one reservation:  The book says that the head should be replace every year and I am wondering what a new head will cost.  It might be cheaper to buy blades so I&#x27;ll have to wait till the year is over to see.  As of now I rate this product excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 8-years and the charger and razor still work fine.  I almost wish they didn&#x27;t, because, I would get rid of this thing and get a razor that actually gave me a decent shave.  As it is, I switch between the Arcitec and my blade razor ... and since I&#x27;m retired, simply don&#x27;t worry too much about how close the Arcitec shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with new blades (head) - a high priced item ($35 range) that seems to need to be replaced about every six months, it doesn&#x27;t take long for the blades to either dull or get clogged to the point that the shave is severely compromised.  The construction doesn&#x27;t allow one to really clean the blades and I suspect this is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll just apply the $35 for a new razor head ... to a new, different razor, and stop being aggravated by this thing.</li>
    <li> I have a 7 year old Norelco shaver and thought about buying this. I don&#x27;t have anything to loose anyway because Norelco guarantees performance for up to 45 days. Well, I am on week 2 and found that I have no reason to do so.</li>
    <li> I believed the hype about this razor but it irritated my skin and gave me a terrible, uncomfortable shave. I sent it back soon after I got it.</li>
    <li> The development of the arcitec shaver began as a challenge from Phillips&#x27; management to its engineers to create a razor that would finally convince users of conventional razors to turn electric. Although the shaving closeness does not match that of a Gillette razor 100% (and perhaps no electric shaver ever will), the results are considered stunning and revolutionary for an electric razor. The design and build are also very modern and trendy, and its an overall worthwhile investment for frequent travelers or anyone who dislikes wet shaving.</li>
    <li> This razor stinks....I bought this and a Braun Pulsonic to test side by side.  I was disappointed by this unit and the Braun walks circles around this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Phillips one Star for packaging the product to make it look attractive...THATS IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have used previous Norelco electric shaver but I like design for this shaver head. I looked the review and was hesitating to buy this one because of trimmer but once I used it I found that head is detachable and Trimmer works fine. I would recommand this over other electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after I had no luck with the new Braun Pulsonic. I had a Norelco in the past that was ok so I figured I would give Norelco another shot.    I must say I was extremely disappointed. To start out-the feel of the shaver was really cheap and light.The head seemed somewhat like a toy.    Let me also say that I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.    Although at times it did cut really close it took an unreal number of passes to get all the hairs which is extremely annoying !  Not just one or two passes. And even after I was done shaving I had to use shaving cream and a blade to get the hairs that this shaver would not cut.ANNOYING!!    The over all feel of the shaver is very cheap. I had the Norelco 6885XL which was a must better heavier shaver.    I got rid of this shaver and just switched to the old Mach and shaving cream which is fine.    I am being totally honest in my review and think that Norelco could have put some old time thinking into these new products.    Even on sale this line of shaver is not worth it.</li>
    <li> As others have said, I too really wanted to like this razor.  I&#x27;ve used a blade for decades, and wanted to believe that an electric razor - purportedly the latest technology version - would work (nearly) as well.  I was very disappointed.  Yup - it looks cool, very avant garde, and high-tech.      The results I experienced - after 4 weeks of trial as suggested by Norelco - is that I had to shave two or three times a day.  I could have had far better results with a blade just once in the morning.      I tried shaving in the shower - which Norelco says works better - with no better results than dry shaving.  My razor is on the way back to Amazon for a refund.    My compliments to Amazon for their return policy.  I&#x27;ve purchased dozens of items through Amazon, and this is the first major disappointment - and has nothing to do with Amazon, but the lack of performance by Norelco.    Save your money - or explore other options.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a Christmmas present for my son, his first real razor. The razor looks fantastic and my son says it is the best save he has ever had.</li>
    <li> I like this razor because it is a quick shave on a bad day. Or anyday I guess. Its just not as great as I would have hoped around the neck and with the side burns. And some hairs it just wont take down. No matter how lond and how red my neck gets. Anyways, I still use it for work and it gets the job done. I just dont think its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don&#x27;t waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs. I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway. Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically: The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70&#x27;s, Jim Belushi said, \\&quot;Buy a triple bladed razor. For those that will believe anything\\&quot;. Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco&#x27;s do a nice job. Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good. Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion. You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it. The less pin-holes the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model. It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can&#x27;t blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can&#x27;t be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it. I know, I know!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-29-07&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Braun 9595 through J&amp;R on Amazon, and it has a 60 day trial return guarantee.  This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.  I was able to return the Arcitec and am really happy with this Braun 9595 model.to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped.

    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it.  The only thing he does not like is that it does not shave his neck very well.  The thing he likes best is that it charges quickly and comes in a protective travel case.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased by me as a Christmas present for my husband. He uses it every day. It took exactly one hour for it&#x27;s very first charge. It is easy to clean, either using the included brush or running the heads under hot water. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in getting one.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for xmas years ago I hate it. My 1st Norelco 4958 from 83 lasted over 20 yrs battery died. I started using this again cuz I was put om Coumadin. Terrible DO NOT BUY THIS STYLE not a close or even far shave.$20 Pocket Braun is so much better</li>
    <li> The plusses include and incredibly close shave and and an extremely eficient cleaning system--each rotary blade is complete accessible to running tap water. But--the shaver body is light weight and flimsy feeling and fits slightly awkwardly in my hand--its tapered body always wants to shift downwards and I end up holding it close to the shaving heads and then press too heavily; it sounds like a wind up toy; the trimmer is silly in terms of size, efficiency and convenience. Probably if I&#x27;d seen this razor it in a retail store and had the opportunity to get its &#x27;hand feel&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. The Norelco &#x27;Jame Bond&#x27; surpasses this model across the board. I have another 40+ days and still may return the 1060, but every time I use it I continue to enjoy it   3+ stars worth and will likely keep it. But I encourage buyers not to forget the easy return policy and hold on to your original sales receipt to keep all options available.</li>
    <li> With a few brief interruptions, I have shaved with Norelco shavers since 1961.  Every time the company advances their technology, I have a fit of skepticism and resist buying the new product...for a while.  I won&#x27;t go into the detail of my progression, but I will say that the advancement from Spectra System to arcitec is more interesting than the ones in the recent past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the balance of the new shaver, and it has given me acceptable--even good--shaves from the very first day.  I have taken much longer to adapt to previous advancements in Norelco shaver technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the shavings collection cups, but I can live with them.  I do, on the other hand, like the charging stand and travel case that allow me to recharge the battery without struggling with the tip of an AC adapter.  I have retired one Norelco shaver because it eventually wouldn&#x27;t accept the cord, but this one shows promise.</li>
    <li> At 63 almost 64 years old,I have always relied on a blade razor,I have tried differant elec razors and all of them irratated my skin too bad to continue using them,as I got older and not being able to see close up without my glasses I&#x27;ve found it harder to shave with a blade,so I thought I would give an elec razor one more chance.  I have always loved Philips products and when I seen this new razor,the arcitec,even though a little pricy,I took a chance and bought it,and its the best chance I ever took,it does take a little longer to shave than with a blade but no nicks,cuts or irratation and I get just as smooth a shave as with a blade,and I can&#x27;t believe how long the battery lasts.  I Love this Shaver and if it ever breaks I will replace it with the same.</li>
    <li> I have received mine just a couple of days ago, so I cannot gave the 5 stars, but as today this is the best electric razor I have ever try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head floats perfect and the shave is very close and best of all it dosen&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> i like it.  it is ergonomic and fits my hand and face easily. it moves easily around my chin and nose and is easy to clean under the faucet.  the shave feels good when i finish.  the best i have ever had.</li>
    <li> For two decades I have fought an uphill battle with a downhill class of products, and I&#x27;m throwing in the towel. I&#x27;ve abandoned this electric razor and gone back to a real razor (a basic Gillette Mach 3).    I switched to a multi-headed electric razor over 20 years ago. \\&quot;Stick with it for 30 days\\&quot; the instructions implored. Yes, it got better, but never equalled my old 2-blade razor. The convenience suckered me in, and the habit was set. I meticulously cleaned and maintained my electric razors, but never attained a clean shave.    But I stuck with it. Replaced the heads, and that worked for a while, but then same old same old. New electric razors seem to get worse. A little Phillips Philishave 30 worked pretty well (2 heads, *battery* powered), but not great.    When this Arcitec came on board, I said \\&quot;this is it!\\&quot; Pricey, but there can be no better, right? Of all the electric razors I have used, I must say that this is the worst. The cleaning system works to a point, but there are inevitably hairs that get lodged in the razor head. And the razor head is effectively *NOT CLEANABLE* except by painstaking surgery to extract lodged hairs.    And the shave? OK, this is not a scientific double-blinded study, but I do honestly believe that this razor provided me with the worst shave of all electric razors I have owned. It got me to jump ship and try a middle-of-the-road Gillette Mach 3. The result ...    HEAVEN! Blades have gotten SO much better since 20 years ago. Super clean shave, no nics, no problems, no irritation ... why did I wait so long??</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for 40+ years, and I love the look and weight of this shaver.    I used it for 6 months and was so dissatisfied I finally switched to the Braun Pulsonic.    The Arcitec shaves poorly and harshly.  The famous floating heads are gone, instead the heads pivot from the center of the assembly - i.e. they tilt away from your skin rather than into your skin.  You end up trying to shave with the middle of the shaver assembly, where there is no cutting head.    Also, they moved the trimmer inboard so it is hidden by your hand if you hold it the way you would normally.  This you can adjust to.    They need a major redesign of the detachable shaving head assembly.  If they made the cutting heads pivot on their centers instead of from the inside edge, it would probably work and they could sell guys like me the redesigned shaving head assembly.  Maybe they could also go back to the Spectra cutters?    JM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of shaves that I get. What I don&#x27;t like is having to clean the shaver daily rather than once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> First you will need an acetylene  torch and a hacksaw to get through the triple layer plastic sarcophagus that Tutankhamun  would&#x27;ve envied. Wear heavy leather gloves or the plastic will filet your fingers. Once inside you&#x27;ll find a razor that resembles the missing link in the Praying Mantis lineage. I was skeptical at first seeing it didn&#x27;t feel all that sturdy like the Braun non-rotary razor I&#x27;d been using. However with this razor I found it required only light pressure to cleanly cut short or longer hairs, whereas I&#x27;ve developed tremendous biceps putting adequate pressure on the Braun to get it to cut anything. I tried one day growth and several days growth and the Arcitec cut it with ease. My face also had a nice sheen when I was done, unlike the road rash from the Braun. Cleaning is a little trying to get all the hair out but manageable. The trimmer is purely an afterthought. It is difficult to use. It is awkwardly positioned and too small to be of any real value. The grip is fairly comfortable except if you have large hands, as I do, then your fingers will start lapping each other, but I digress. Overall it is a very good razor. It conforms to your face nicely and manages difficult curves and tight spots easily. That&#x27;s what I like most about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this model about a month ago from Costco for $119. The package also included a bonus 2 head battery powered Norelco travel shaver. What a deal! The Aritec 1060 is without a doubt, the best Norelco I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve been through a lot of them. The shave is extremely close, fast and comfortable. The shaver stays up on power for a long, long time before needing charging. It&#x27;s so easy to clean with running water or the supplied brush. The only downside that I can see is the replacement cost of the shaving head (you can&#x27;t replace just the rotor blades). However, the overall quality of this shaver makes it a must for a clean, smooth shave. The bonus battery shaver which came with the 1060 is amazing! It&#x27;s perfect for traveling. I do wish it had a sideburn trimmer though. All in all, this is a great package deal and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I like this shaver and think it works great. However, the black/silvery coating on the on/off button and the central piece of the shaver comes off after about 2 months of use. Does not affect the shave but the looks of the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband who swore he would never like an electic shaver. He has used it for about a month now and LOVES it. He said he never knew what he was missing.</li>
    <li> I was overall very disappointed with this shaver.  One would think that the top-of-the-line series from Norelco would be a great choice.  My experience was far from that.    First, the shaver does not deliver good shaving coverage on the neck and overall shaving was slow.  I have a 9 year old Norelco that covers my neck better, and delivers a faster shave.  This is despite only having one set of blades per head and not being able to pivot.    Second, the chrome plating on the display of the shaver began to peel off.  Although it looked nice when new, I would not expect a product of this quality to have a visual defect such as that.      Third, there is very little storage for hairs.  The shaver needs to be emptied by folding back each of the blade heads individually.  This wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I&#x27;d rather have a razor that can handle a few shaves worth of hairs.      On the positive side, the charging stand and the travel case are very nice, the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.  However, if you want a rotary shaver, I&#x27;d choose a less expensive rotary model.  I replaced this unit with a Braun 590CC and am thrilled with the performance of that shaver vs. the Norelco thus far.</li>
    <li> Shaves faster  Light weigh  Fast recharge  Excellent battery duration  Shaving heads adapts to face curves</li>
    <li> I have used a NORELCO all my life and this the worst by far. It takes a lot of work to get a good shave. I have changes the head and nothing seems to work. I have gone beck to my eight year on NORELCO which is by far superior. Dont wast your money.</li>
    <li> The Shave:&lt;br /&gt;This is a lower-cost version of the Norelco 1090.  The major diffference is the display. The floating heads on the Norelco electric shaver really do a good job of conforming to the curves of my face. It takes me about five minutes to shave. The shave is much more uniform than that of the Braun 3615 that I have been using for the past few years. However, the shave is not as close. Before the Braun, I used a Norelco 5801. This model is a big improvement over the old Norelco which was slow and not very close at all. The trade-off with respect to the Braun is one of a closer shave using the Braun vs. a more uniform shave with the new Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance:&lt;br /&gt;The clippings are collected in pockets under the shaving heads, This is an advantage in that the clippings are not scattered over the bathroom sink as they are with some electric razors. The pockets have to be cleaned out every shave or two. This is not a big problem. It only takes a few seconds. The manual indicates that the RQ10 shaving head assembly must be replaced every year. Amazon offers the RQ10 for $35. By contrast the Braun cutter and foil assembly which lasts for about one year sells on Amazon for around $24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I found that I had to replace the head assembly after 6 months. I am now using a Remington Flex 360 Rotary Shaver which has a design similiar to the Norelco but provides a faster, closer shave, and costs a lot less.</li>
    <li> I have bought Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 for \\&quot;My Valentine\\&quot; and here is what he said: \\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco Arcitec for about a week and truly enjoy the experience.  It&#x27;s comfortable to handle and use.  Very simple to clean.  The shave is the closest I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.  Great product!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Prior to buying this product I read a lot of bad reviews. I decided to buy it anyway.  I am very glad I didn&#x27;t listen to all those bad reviews.  Initially I wasn&#x27;t very impressed by the closeness of the shave. But after using it for a week or so I noticed that the shave was at least as close as my previous norelco razor.  I like the feel of the razor when shaving. The heads get into closer places than my previous razor could get to, like those tricky hairs right below the nose. The trimmer works well and is really neat once you get used to it.  The pod case that comes with it fits well in a shoe in my suitcase which is very handy on the numerous trips I make. And after 3 weeks plus of use I still have plenty of my initial charge. Overall a very good razor, I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It does a clean shave on my face but it misses some neck hairs.  I have a thick beard and shaving daily with a disposable razor really tears up my face.  This is definitely a lot easier on my skin but I sometimes have to follow up with a disposable razor on my neck to get all the hairs.  That is why it gets a four out of five stars.  I previously had a braun razor and it was horrible.  I would have gotten a cleaner, closer shave with a dull knife then what I got with the braun.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised......thanks.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement electric shaver. Am a Norelco user now but wasn&#x27;t totally pleased with this replacement - mainly not as good - in the closeness and smoothness of the shave ( as compared to my old Norelco shaver).</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000PKKAFK Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] I purchased this item as a gift for a family member. He says he gets a better shave from this Norelco than from all the other razors he has used. I checked prices in our area, and I can tell you that I saved a lot of &#x27;bucks&#x27; buying thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco electric razor products for many years. This is the first one I hated. It does a terrible job of shaving and the trimmer is all but useless. I went back to one of their standard models at less than half the price and it works great. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
