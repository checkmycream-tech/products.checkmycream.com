### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Is it perfect</li>
      <li>It fell out with a rub of a wash cloth, so I was happy and thought I am going to get a case of this stuff!</li>
      <li>i have no complants it cleans the hair just like a real good shave.</li>
      <li>and it did not do a very good job on remove the hair</li>
      <li>this is the ideal product for the bald man.    </li>
      <li>Great product of excellent quality.</li>
      <li>Great idea just does not work as advertised, not at all...</li>
      <li>This stuff is great to rub all over your mans head</li>
      <li>it works great</li>
      <li>worked great for me.</li>
      <li>It does wonders, great product, keep it up.&lt;br /&gt;User</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>order came on time and it works good</li>
      <li>the good news was that i still suffered no irritation, redness, or inflammation of the scalp.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS!</li>
      <li>I recommend buying 2 or more tubes, you have to cake it on pretty think to get good results, but it works great!!!</li>
      <li>friendly and good value for money too.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good (but its worth it!)</li>
      <li>shave or apply more.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if I can give the credit to Magic Shave Cream.</li>
      <li>It works I&#x27;ve been using magic shave for months now</li>
      <li>To my surprise magic cream worked, I had to add two applications</li>
      <li>This stuff really works great...</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t say it works any better than the others do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly magic.</li>
      <li>I know it is anti-growth on top, but I guess it is anti-magic, too.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m having to use it more often.</li>
      <li>this was just touching up the head since I already had gotten it bald with a razor.  </li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t take off much more hair either.</li>
      <li>I did like the others and let it set in more than the twenty minutes,</li>
      <li>(b) is a 10-20 minute procedure, (c) requires manually scraping of the hair to have any semblance of hair removal, and (d) costs more than shaving.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was because this product is made more for African-Americans</li>
      <li>Great replacement from the old power stuff.</li>
      <li>- I use it over most of my body, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>it is affordable and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll sell you my more than 3/4 full tube for $1.</li>
      <li>I find the longest i can go w/o is 3 days, to keep the dome looking fine.</li>
      <li>worked better than most hair removal products and it did not smell funny or burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wife says it works great and anyone looking for this type of product should definitely try this brand.</li>
      <li>baby smooth shave</li>
      <li>This can be used this way, however I recommend a lightly abrasive hair removal sponge to use with it.</li>
      <li>result: SUCCESS!  </li>
      <li>this is the first time I used magic cream.</li>
      <li>better yet is the fact that, after an application, you can NEITHER apply the cream again NOR use a razor for 24 hours, which means i got to spend a day walking around looking less like a \\&quot;sexy tattooed guy with a shaved head\\&quot; and more like a \\&quot;guy who tried to shave his head during a grand mal seizure\\&quot;.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, smells good and works really well.</li>
      <li>True story.</li>
      <li>then, i decided to tempt fate and leave it on a full TWO MINUTES longer than the instructions advise.  </li>
      <li>Strong like the first stuff.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend magic over the use of a razor.</li>
      <li>It did work well on the top of my head, as that portion was completely bald, but when it came to the rest of my head, a good amount of hair was still present on my head</li>
      <li>It kind of worked but left hair on my head.</li>
      <li>my husband has a major amount of hair on his back and it worked great.</li>
      <li>Ok I have cut my own my hair for the past 30 yrs</li>
      <li>i LIKE the way my head is all smooth and soft when it&#x27;s freshly shaven.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you have a thick wash cloth, mix warm water to hot as you can stand it, also some scalps are more sensitive than others I let magic cream stay on my scalp for 4 mins the first app and 11 mins the second.</li>
      <li>at first i was scared it was going to burn my skin</li>
      <li>i started timing it when the first bit of cream touched my scalp, watched the clock like a fat kid watching a burrito in the microwave, and jumped in the shower at 9 minutes, frantically wiping off the cream and clumps of hair.    </li>
      <li>Worked well, just smells funny.</li>
      <li>I tried many different razors, shaving creams and after shave products but nothing worked like this has!</li>
      <li>I use this cream regularly and I love it.</li>
      <li>My teenage daughters love this product.  </li>
      <li>This has gotten my sensitive areas as smooth as the day I was born with no irritation.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly, but it didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do in my opinion.</li>
      <li>First, Magic Shave was made specifically for Black men because our hair is different (more curly) than most other men making us more susceptible to razor bumps.</li>
      <li>I use an old credit card to scrape it off and clean any missed areas with a razor.</li>
      <li>First off I tried the small spot and it seemed to work out good.  </li>
      <li>I like the description of this item, mainly because it sold me on making this purchase, but overall I&#x27;m not satisfied or impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>and my hair grow pretty fast so thats why i had to do it 3 times.</li>
      <li>If you have been around someone who’s had a perm the smell of lye is similar not as strong</li>
      <li>Tried it once, left it on for 12 minutes, nothing except for the really fine hair was removed.</li>
      <li>My son said it was good he is having a hard time finding the length to work with.</li>
      <li>After the I started the whole head</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product thanks.</li>
      <li>IT, I was really hoping this stuff would work.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
      <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>I put it on much thicker.</li>
      <li>so I left it on for nearly a hour making sure to keep it moist as it recommends.</li>
      <li>I use this on my upper lip, armpits, legs and most sensitive lady region.</li>
      <li>highly recommend</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve used other hair-removal creams on different parts of my body in the past, and found that they mostly worked pretty well, so i was enthusiastic to see that someone had developed one for the scalp.    </li>
      <li>to be completely honest this stuff actually works, you only need to apply thickness on your head or somewhere on your body, the only problem is that it doesnt take away all the hair permanently</li>
      <li>Iv&#x27;e been using this for over 10 years with no complaint.</li>
      <li>give the cream a few days to sure my scalp have no allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>Used this works good but smells bad other than that seems to work good.</li>
      <li>This product is well worth it, and i stay behind Magic Shave products.</li>
      <li>the first wasn&#x27;t enough</li>
      <li>further, instead of trying to wipe the cream and hair off \\&quot;gently\\&quot;, per the instructions, i mauled my scalp with a hot rag.    </li>
      <li>My suggestion use enough the first time it works well.</li>
      <li>i thought this sounded pretty terrific.  </li>
      <li>I have a very thick and curly beard and normal razors (no matter the kind)</li>
      <li>and it took it all off, and a few guys have used in \\&quot;down there\\&quot; with good results.  </li>
      <li>Im not sure if this product will work for more straight hair, but i&#x27;ve used the powder in the blue can since i was a teenager.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this</li>
      <li>I went into this purchase with an open mind, but in the end, although the price was reasonable, I didn&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
      <li>i really remove the facial hair on my face</li>
      <li>Was hoping this would work my face really is sensitive to razors</li>
      <li>and my skin has cleared up completely since using it about three years ago.</li>
      <li>no, typically I have to wait 5-6 minutes for it to take off all of the hair.</li>
      <li>this time i didn&#x27;t start the timer until the very last bit of cream was applied, rather than starting it immediately upon the first drop making contact with my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It smells like crap and gave me a rash well discolored my skin. But am I mad. Nope. Because I found $5 on the floor the same day so I don&#x27;t know if I can give the credit to Magic Shave Cream. But that is why it got two stars from me and not 1.</li>
    <li> order came on time and it works good</li>
    <li> to be completely honest this stuff actually works, you only need to apply thickness on your head or somewhere on your body, the only problem is that it doesnt take away all the hair permanently but it does the job close to baldness, i used it for my underarms and  some other areas besides the head, now in order to get it to work, you must apply to whereever you want your hair off apply not too thick on a dry area of your skin, now wait at least 5-10 minutes then use the wet rag to clear it off slowly and deep scrub, there you go</li>
    <li> i really remove the facial hair on my face my beard mouth area sideburns baby smooth shave i had to apply like i think 3 times because i hadn&#x27;t shaved in like over 2 weeks and my hair grow pretty fast so thats why i had to do it 3 times. it took a while for the hair to grow back though.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  it is affordable and easy to use.  and it is convenient for travel.  this is the ideal product for the bald man.    Shine Head</li>
    <li> It was kind of hard to find this product so its not easy to obtain. The smell is not hardcore like a lot of hair removers but I can&#x27;t say it works any better than the others do. Because of the availability with shipping I think it is easier to just go get the regular products in stores. My hair type is very thick.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff on my beard and it has been the ONLY method of shaving that has gotten rid of my razor burn and bumps. I have a very thick and curly beard and normal razors (no matter the kind) would constantly leave me with irritating, painful and unsightly red bumps. I tried many different razors, shaving creams and after shave products but nothing worked like this has! This stuff put an end to that and my skin has cleared up completely since using it about three years ago. I only apply it to my lower beard below my jawline as that is the only problem area I have. I can shave normally in other areas without irritation. If any out there have thick and curly beard which causes irritation when shaving normally, TRY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It doesn&#x27;t smell good (but its worth it!) and I leave it on for about 10-15 minutes or until I start scraping and the hair comes off. Leave on until hair comes off when scraping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> First, Magic Shave was made specifically for Black men because our hair is different (more curly) than most other men making us more susceptible to razor bumps. Im not sure if this product will work for more straight hair, but i&#x27;ve used the powder in the blue can since i was a teenager. No razor bumbs ever!!! Once you get past the smell (smells like rotten eggs), you will appreciate the product. I have been using the cream for bald head shaving for several years, having to use the cream designed for your face before then--which didnt work as well. This product is well worth it, and i stay behind Magic Shave products. Again, i have been using them for over 25 years and will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> this product did not work for me. bummmmmerrr. but i&#x27;m not a man and it was made for men, so maybe that&#x27;s why. ha.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. Didn&#x27;t even get half the hair and made my skin red and irritated still.</li>
    <li> I purchased this looking to decrease my maintenance time for keeping my head bald. It did not work well at all, I left it on for 10-11 minutes and it only removed some of the hair and only in spots. This left me with a very unsightly piebald pattern on my head :(</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. worked great for me. at first i was scared it was going to burn my skin but   nothing bad happened. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.  no irritation/sorenesss. I HIGHLY recommend magic over the use of a razor.</li>
    <li> First of all, this cream smells AWFUL. I never got past the testing process because I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell. It kind of worked but left hair on my head. I don&#x27;t know if it was because this product is made more for African-Americans but I&#x27;m definitely sticking with a razor.</li>
    <li> Bought the product hoping to eliminate shaving with a razor.  Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Either the product is useless, or I have the most stubborn beard anywhere.  Left it on for 15 minutes at one time per the label&#x27;s instructions, and all it did was burn my skin.  I walked around with what looked like a bad sunburn for a day.  Oh well... back to the razor.</li>
    <li> Worked well, just smells funny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a white guy with a shaved head. After a 2 days with some stubble I used this product. I followed the directions and no hair came off. My head feels burnt a little. The cream smells weird. Then I read the ingredients. I can&#x27;t believe I put all those nasty chemicals on my head. I want my money back. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Awful. Did not work and burned my neck something fierce.</li>
    <li> I left it on twice the amount of time it called for and it still did not remove any hair. Plus the tube was busted and leaked all over the rest of the package. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This did not work only burned my skin</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> it works great i have no complants it cleans the hair just like a real good shave. this is my 2nd time buying this brand</li>
    <li> I contemplated getting a Brazilian but I hate pain &amp; didn&#x27;t want a stranger judging me. I read about this on a blog and decided to try. This has gotten my sensitive areas as smooth as the day I was born with no irritation. Nair burns...this does not. Nair smells awful...this does not. The hair stays gone for about 10 days and no ingrowns. This is a winner. Did not work quite as well under my arms but so what.</li>
    <li> did not like the way it fault and it did not do a very good job on remove the hair it falt like it melted it but did not remove it</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this as a recomendation online to help me in my sensitive areas. Didn&#x27;t work at all and smelled awful! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Smells bad and didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a J-O-K-E. If I could give it no stars I would. I used it to days in a row. It barely took any hair off. The first time I used it I thought maybe I put it on too thin. So, for trial 2 I put it on much thicker. It STILL barely took any hair off. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. You will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this to remove ear hair and my unibrow, which is not what the product is made for. However, it works for me and has never caused irritation.</li>
    <li> This product is not effective at all! I applied for quite a while but no hair came off. Do not waste your money on this</li>
    <li> Total rubbish does not do what they state</li>
    <li> True story. I use this on my upper lip, armpits, legs and most sensitive lady region. It&#x27;s truly magic. I use an old credit card to scrape it off and clean any missed areas with a razor. It&#x27;s changed my life.</li>
    <li> After 3 attempts and leaving the product on for the maximum time, it did not work at all.  Very dissappointed.</li>
    <li> It works after eight minutes to remove hair and last for one day as hair is visible. I believe that I need a stronger cream. followed all the recommendations.</li>
    <li> I baught this in Iraq as a joke, but the joke was on me.  It works like magic!(no pun intended).  We used it on my head and I have thick hair, we put it on a guys back who is like a werewolf and it took it all off, and a few guys have used in \\&quot;down there\\&quot; with good results.  I recommend buying 2 or more tubes, you have to cake it on pretty think to get good results, but it works great!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work but my girlfriend&#x27;s nair worked.</li>
    <li> worked better than most hair removal products and it did not smell funny or burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product to anyone who needs to remove hair from their head.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works great...my husband has a major amount of hair on his back and it worked great. We will buy again</li>
    <li> It works I&#x27;ve been using magic shave for months now and it does do the job. Is it perfect no, typically I have to wait 5-6 minutes for it to take off all of the hair. The sides for me were the hardest parts as there would hair left over. Magic Shave does the trick of getting a slightly closer shave in half the time as I would using my clippers. To avoid bumps I had to use a cold wet towel to wipe away the cream.</li>
    <li> Less time needed...worked well for my armpits.</li>
    <li> I use this cream regularly and I love it. It works very well removing hair and with little to no irritation .</li>
    <li> Used this works good but smells bad other than that seems to work good. I would recommend this product thanks.</li>
    <li> My son said it was good he is having a hard time finding the length to work with.</li>
    <li> It does wonders, great product, keep it up.&lt;br /&gt;User friendly and good value for money too.  Try again dissapointed mate.</li>
    <li> I like the description of this item, mainly because it sold me on making this purchase, but overall I&#x27;m not satisfied or impressed with this product. I followed the directions exactly, but it didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do in my opinion. It did work well on the top of my head, as that portion was completely bald, but when it came to the rest of my head, a good amount of hair was still present on my head and I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my head to start with! I went into this purchase with an open mind, but in the end, although the price was reasonable, I didn&#x27;t care for it at all. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> i picked this product up at my local grocery store a few months ago after finally deciding to \\&quot;take the plunge\\&quot; and go bald.  i&#x27;d shaved my head with a razor for several weeks and found it to be a bit of a hassle, so i was eagerly exploring alternatives.  i thought this sounded pretty terrific.  i&#x27;ve used other hair-removal creams on different parts of my body in the past, and found that they mostly worked pretty well, so i was enthusiastic to see that someone had developed one for the scalp.    like all chemical hair removers, this one comes with plenty of warnings about the dangers of skin irritation, so i approached with some caution.  i followed the application instructions to the letter and didn&#x27;t leave the cream on a second longer than the longest time (9 minutes) indicated on the bottle.  i started timing it when the first bit of cream touched my scalp, watched the clock like a fat kid watching a burrito in the microwave, and jumped in the shower at 9 minutes, frantically wiping off the cream and clumps of hair.    result: SUCCESS!  well, if by \\&quot;success\\&quot; you mean \\&quot;a few parts of your scalp are indeed smooth, but other parts are still stubbly, and in one patch the stubble is still actually visible\\&quot;.  better yet is the fact that, after an application, you can NEITHER apply the cream again NOR use a razor for 24 hours, which means i got to spend a day walking around looking less like a \\&quot;sexy tattooed guy with a shaved head\\&quot; and more like a \\&quot;guy who tried to shave his head during a grand mal seizure\\&quot;.    but me, i&#x27;m no quitter.  so a few weeks later (that is, tonight), i decided to try again, with a few modifications.  this time i didn&#x27;t start the timer until the very last bit of cream was applied, rather than starting it immediately upon the first drop making contact with my skin.  then, i decided to tempt fate and leave it on a full TWO MINUTES longer than the instructions advise.  so at 11 minutes in, i casually undress, stroll into the bathroom, and start theshower running.  further, instead of trying to wipe the cream and hair off \\&quot;gently\\&quot;, per the instructions, i mauled my scalp with a hot rag.    the good news was that i still suffered no irritation, redness, or inflammation of the scalp.  but the results were, sadly, almost identical to the first time, and that was AFTER playing russian roulette with what the company seems to agree are potentially dangerous chemicals.  and, worse, i have (or had) a date tomorrow.    worst of all, i just hate the way that it FEELS.  i LIKE being a bald man.  i LIKE the way my head is all smooth and soft when it&#x27;s freshly shaven.  and so does my girlfriend.  but now i&#x27;ve got this mess.  it feels bad, it looks bad, and i can&#x27;t do anything about it for 24 hours.    frankly, i feel cheated.  do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this to get the bald look to match my little 6 year old&#x27;s head.  He is going through Chemotherapy and will be for the next year.  I promised him I would get a blad head like him.  After reading the reviews and not finding any that work on heads, I decided to go for it.  What a mistake!  First off I tried the small spot and it seemed to work out good.  I did like the others and let it set in more than the twenty minutes, actually was around a half hour.  It fell out with a rub of a wash cloth, so I was happy and thought I am going to get a case of this stuff! I waited the 24 hours to see if I had a reaction, none, so I did it the day before his benefit...what a mistake!  After the I started the whole head I got patchy results, mind you this was just touching up the head since I already had gotten it bald with a razor.  I seriously used the whole tube and it was on for the half hour.  It only took about a third of my hair off and it burned once it got to a bigger area.  So the spot test doesn&#x27;t always work out as planned!  The spots that it did work on, it was NOT SMOOTH and still had the stuble feel!!</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this. Tried it once, left it on for 12 minutes, nothing except for the really fine hair was removed. Will repeat for longer time now that I know it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my skin. I will update this review (if I remember to).</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN OLDIE BUT GOODIE, AND IT SIMPLY WORKS EVERY SINGLE TIME JUST AS IT STATES.  I LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> I left it on twice as long as I was supposed to and all it did was melt the hair into weird little balls and not fall out. I was then forced to bic my head while it was irritated from this stuff. Not a good product for a guy that has fairly thin hair that was clippered before I used the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave my head everyday as my hair grows like weeds. One of the warnings on the bottle says not to shave for at least a day after using this product. After reading a few reviews I felt the recommended 20mins would not be enough for my hair so I left it on for nearly a hour making sure to keep it moist as it recommends. The result was looking like I had radiation poisoning. It only removed hair in patches. I had two choices....shave or apply more. I picked the former as I had to work that night and I didn&#x27;t want the second coat to burn my head. The second attempt with this product yielded the same results but as I didn&#x27;t have to work that night I applied a second coating. It didn&#x27;t scald my head but it didn&#x27;t take off much more hair either. Again I had to dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I could have saved time and money by just using a razor.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great to rub all over your mans head</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been using this for over 10 years with no complaint. This is for maintaining, a bald head not giving a haircut. I find the longest i can go w/o is 3 days, to keep the dome looking fine.</li>
    <li> It works, but there is still stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on the front of my pelvic area-just the front!- and it is difficult to remove all of the hair. This can be used this way, however I recommend a lightly abrasive hair removal sponge to use with it.</li>
    <li> Ordered the product because I got tired of shaving my head 7 days a week.  Followed instructions to the letter.  Left it on for 3 minutes, nothing, left it on for 6 minutes, still have stubble.  I actually left the product on my scalp for 12 MINUTES and saw VERY little difference.  Product DOES NOT work.  I&#x27;ll sell you my more than 3/4 full tube for $1.</li>
    <li> Wife says it works great and anyone looking for this type of product should definitely try this brand. highly recommend</li>
    <li> I will swear by this shave cream - I use it over most of my body, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. The smell is a little weird.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple, it smelled bad and did not work. No hair was removed, only created irritation and left me with the same amount of hair I syatyed with. UGH</li>
    <li> Great idea just does not work as advertised, not at all...Wish it had...</li>
    <li> To my surprise magic cream worked, I had to add two applications the first wasn&#x27;t enough so I add enough the second time. Make sure you have a thick wash cloth, mix warm water to hot as you can stand it, also some scalps are more sensitive than others I let magic cream stay on my scalp for 4 mins the first app and 11 mins the second. My suggestion use enough the first time it works well. If you are worried about the smell don&#x27;t its minor. If you have been around someone who’s had a perm the smell of lye is similar not as strong but you can smell it. Ok I have cut my own my hair for the past 30 yrs this is the first time I used magic cream. I do believe I will continue use magic cream as of now ill give the cream a few days to sure my scalp have no allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> This works well to also to shave my legs.  It&#x27;s gentle, smells good and works really well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use for ten minutes and SHOWER off.Use a face cloth in the SHOWER.</li>
    <li> Was hoping this would work my face really is sensitive to razors wished I would have read some of the reviews I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have hair that is anti-magic. I know it is anti-growth on top, but I guess it is anti-magic, too. This product didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I tried multiple times, for a variety of different times each time, and much too my disappointment, nothing. I can assure you that if you leave it on too long, you can get a nasty burn out of it. I know I did. Regardless, this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughters love this product.  They use it to remove the hair on their legs.</li>
    <li> Great replacement from the old power stuff.Strong like the first stuff.It take thick hair off.</li>
    <li> I broke out like something fierce</li>
    <li> I left this stuff on in a thick layer for fifteen minutes, scrubbed the hell out of my skin taking it off, and still ended up with a bunch of stubble and hair that grew back the next day.  I did it twice in a week just in case it was a hair growth cycle issue... nope, same results.  Worse than shaving because (a) leaves stubble same day, (b) is a 10-20 minute procedure, (c) requires manually scraping of the hair to have any semblance of hair removal, and (d) costs more than shaving.  Very disappointing.  I have fair skin and dark hair, medium thickness, and used it under my arms reasoning that the hair there couldn&#x27;t possibly be any thicker, i.e. more difficult to remove chemically, than a black man&#x27;s facial hair. DANG IT, I was really hoping this stuff would work.  Back to waxing for me.</li>
    <li> I like it. It works to remove the hair but I think my hair grows faster. So, I&#x27;m having to use it more often.</li>
    <li> Product did not work. Some hair fell out but had to shave afterwards. Skin broke out in a bad rash that lasted for several weeks.</li>
