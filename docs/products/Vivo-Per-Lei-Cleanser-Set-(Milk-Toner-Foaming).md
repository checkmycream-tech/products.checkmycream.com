    <li> excellent product. I love the foaming cleanser doesn&#x27;t over dry. The cleansing milk is great for removing eye makeup. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> I bought Vivo peels and was very happy about it but when I received this set, I was Dissatisfied. The quality of bottles are horrible. Pumps are not working properly, the product itself does not make any difference than applying water...</li>
    <li> Very gentle cleanser and toner - I love that I can use the facial wash at night to remove makeup and the milk wash in the morning when I&#x27;m looking for a more gentle cleanser.  Used to pay a lot to use Orogold, which has a similar product, paid way too much for it and this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> I love it. Great price and it works!!</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product but so far I am really liking it.  The packaging is a bit inconvenient.  It takes alot of pumps to get needed amount.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. The cleanser really didn&#x27;t foam. I liked the milk cleanser better.</li>
    <li> I love Vivo Per Lei and I keep reordering. The shipment came quickly and without incident.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash set. Only thing I have found since I started getting bad skin as a kid that will clean and clear up my face and body</li>
    <li> I tried all 3 of these because a friend told me how amazing they were, but it ruined my face.

    <li> It works really well without having that dry feeling after you wash your face.  I would certainly buy this again as it makes your skin feel clean, smooth and refreshed.  Great price compared to other products that do not even come close to the results.</li>
    <li> Very good product, and you cant beat the price.  At the local mall it cost me 80.00 for one bottle of cleanser.</li>
    <li> I am using the milk cleanser as it is winter time and I am pleased with the light fragrance, and cleansing.  I have tried the toner, but didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  I will use the foaming cleanser in the summer time.  Over all I like these products!</li>
    <li> At first I was very skeptic about purchasing my favorite facial products on amazon because the prize was so low comaparing to what I pay for it at the mall but I was very pleased. Everything was packaged the way it should be and it was NOT  a knock off - it&#x27;s the real dealtake it from someone whose paid full prize.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. I personally didn&#x27;t see any difference in my face when using this product. I felt like it was more effort to clean my face with the same results  that Ive always had with other face washes.</li>
    <li> love love love this product</li>
