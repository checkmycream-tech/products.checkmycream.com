      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite deodorant I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to see this on Amazon, as it&#x27;s my favorite scent and now discontinued.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this from Walmart and liked it.  </li>
      <li>so good people think is my perfume..;)</li>
      <li>Love the light elegant scent.</li>
      <li>Smells so good and really fights against wetness all day.</li>
      <li>Very clean, fresh smelling scent!</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d stock up on this while some was still available since Dove decided to discontinue this scent.  </li>
      <li>With free shipping, it wasn&#x27;t a huge difference, but still.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and am glad I could find it at such a great price.</li>

      <li>I was really puzzled when I realized that I couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelves at many places anymore.</li>
      <li>I love things that smell like grapefruit, so I really wanted to like this, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  </li>
      <li>The deodorant itself does a good job and has a really decent staying power, although sometimes it does act as more of a mask than an actual deodorizer.</li>
      <li>This is not how you show appreciation and respect to people who have been loyal to your brand.</li>
      <li>Please respond with an explanation and solution or you will lose, at minimum, 5 loyal consumers as my family, nor I will ever buy ANY of your products again.</li>
      <li>Dove deodorants are reliable, simple, exceptional, and a staple.  </li>
      <li>Luckily I contacted the seller and I can return them.</li>
      <li>Love this deodorante very light feel and lasts long with a fresh clean scent.</li>
      <li>It stays fresh and cool all day, even after my workouts.</li>
      <li>I had to switch to Secret PH Balance which is super awesome</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine for a day when I&#x27;m not doing much,</li>
      <li>this deod doesn&#x27;t exactly keeping you from sweating, but it smells good for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Fresh Energizing Antiperspirant/Deodorant (perhaps any fragrance -</li>
      <li>The scent is so appealing (is that not half of the deodorant struggle?).</li>
      <li>You put this product on the shelves and took it right off again.</li>
      <li>It was nice, but a little strong.</li>
      <li>Very subtle interesting and pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>, I tried again and ordered a two pack this time hoping the first was a fluke.</li>
      <li>but I am pretty upset about this.</li>
      <li>I have only been able to find it on Amazon, so I have been stocking up.  </li>
      <li>I love this deoderant and the only place I can find it is on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I do not think it has enough grapefruit oil in it, but it works ok and has a non-invasive smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long lasting, doesn&#x27;t cake up and the only deodorant that whose scent works perfectly with my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>I found it much more effective than Secret.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell good, it is the only scent that does the job it is suppose to do.  </li>
      <li>It is a gross sickeningly sweet baby powder like scent!</li>
      <li>Other than this being expired  &amp; taking forever to get here, I&#x27;m super excited to have my favorite deodorant back!</li>
      <li>For me it smells like a summer morning by the shore with all of the windows open while folding super fresh laundry.</li>
      <li>My underarms used to get very irritated after shaving, but when I am using this particular deodorant... no issues!</li>
      <li>really well</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>love to fresh scent and how it keeps me dry all day long.</li>
      <li>I have one of these in the en-suite, main bathroom, bathroom downstairs and my wardrobe - would never be without it.</li>
      <li>grapefruit and lemongrass scent was a big draw for me to purchase Dove to begin with, and the ease and quick delivery of ordering from Amazon put it over the top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Dove Go</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So when I sweat at all, it doesn&#x27;t hold up, and it compounds the normal B.O. smell.  </li>
      <li>I love this deodorant, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores, so I will definitely keep buying here for a long time!</li>
      <li>It keeps you smelling fresh and dry for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s subtle, but distinct, and it mixes with other scents and perfumes pleasantly.</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t have that security with other products); glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t pull my skin.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll be going back to the green kind when this runs out.</li>
      <li>this scent is almost impossible to find in stores now a days, my gf continued to tell me &amp;#34;i cant find my favorite brand of deodorant, bla bla bla&amp;#34; good thing i listen because when i gave her this she was really happy (but then mad because she then thought i only bought her the deodorant because she smells)</li>
      <li>I like the green and pink scents of the Go Fresh line (I want to say cucumber and passionfruit maybe, can&#x27;t remember the exact scents); one smells fresh and the other one sweet.  </li>
      <li>This is a complete rip off.  </li>
      <li>If you prefer less scent, I would try the Cool Essentials.</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t bring the price down, you will lose loyal customers like me.</li>

    <li> Just started using one of the four pack I purchased in mid March and the scent IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT AND LEMONGRASS! It is a gross sickeningly sweet baby powder like scent! Hate it! Will contact seller to see if I can return. What a waste of 22.00!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 21, 2015 update:&lt;br /&gt;Fool me twice - shame on me!&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tried again and ordered a two pack this time hoping the first was a fluke. Just received them yesterday (April 20) and both had the wrong scent (baby powdery) again. Luckily I contacted the seller and I can return them. So, so, so disappointed!!!!! I don&#x27;t blame the seller, Dove has just lost a long time customer...</li>
    <li> I love how this deodorant smells. Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and am glad I could find it at such a great price. I like the smell and they way it does not clump.</li>
    <li> This Dove scent has been my favorite since it hit the market years ago. Lately I have had trouble findind it on the shelves, probably due to the additional new scents Dove has expanded to. So glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I get told all the time that I smell good and its honestly this stuff. the other scents just don&#x27;t do anything for me. this deod doesn&#x27;t exactly keeping you from sweating, but it smells good for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried others and always end up wanting this. Happy that it is being sold in bulk on amazon.</li>
    <li> Love the light elegant scent.</li>
    <li> I discovered the liquid version of this antiperspirant  in London and it did indeed help with wetness when I was all dressed up with somewhere to go!.  I could only find the stick version here in USA  and I do not think it has enough grapefruit oil in it, but it works ok and has a non-invasive smell and I do not smell rancid and offending like many products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to most perfumes and deodorants along with laundry products and I feel fresher with this product for heading out and about</li>
    <li> I like the green and pink scents of the Go Fresh line (I want to say cucumber and passionfruit maybe, can&#x27;t remember the exact scents); one smells fresh and the other one sweet.  This one, however, smells awful, kind of sickly and bitter at the same time like Lysol.  Every time I raise my arm, I almost gag.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I loved the grapefruit &amp; lemongrass scent when it was available.  This product smells like baby powder, and nothing like the products I used to purchase!!!  What a disappointment!!!  DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU&#x27;RE HOPING THESE SMELL LIKE THE PRODUCTS THAT USED TO SELL STORES!!!  This is a complete rip off.  I never write reviews but I am pretty upset about this.</li>
    <li> I freaked out when I couldn&#x27;t find my usual deodorant at CVS and bought this four-pack on Amazon - only to find it for less a few days later at Target. I should have checked the price before buying but sort of just assumed between it being Amazon and buying multiple at once that it was a deal. With free shipping, it wasn&#x27;t a huge difference, but still.</li>
    <li> It was ok. I don&#x27;t prefer the scent and I won&#x27;t purchase again but it did the job.</li>
    <li> Dove deodorant is my favorite brand. I&#x27;m an athlete, so I need sweat control. Dove is the best of any deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, and it also smells great! I have really sensitive skin and allergies, so I hate heavy scents. I found it much more effective than Secret. It&#x27;s not sticky at all, and lasts all day. I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I did prefer some of the other scents I tried to this one. It was nice, but a little strong. If you prefer less scent, I would try the Cool Essentials.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and really fights against wetness all day. I get compliments on the smell all the time, people cant believe its not lotion its deodorant! My fav brand and fav scent!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that I have found that doesn&#x27;t make my armpits break out AND it smells good. I like the Dove line in general but this one is my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. Sucks I can&#x27;t buy it at the stores</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it works well I may have to reapply once. But not all the time usually last all day and typically after a stressful day.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this from Walmart and liked it.  Then I could not find it anymore until I checked Amazon.  It keeps you smelling fresh and dry for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to see this on Amazon, as it&#x27;s my favorite scent and now discontinued.  However, 3 of the 4 sticks do not smell like the original scent, and are definitely closer to powder scented, which is super disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant ever! I was really puzzled when I realized that I couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelves at many places anymore. It stays fresh and cool all day, even after my workouts. My underarms used to get very irritated after shaving, but when I am using this particular deodorant... no issues!</li>
    <li> Whey did dove discontinue this scent???? I love this deoderant and the only place I can find it is on Amazon. Not only does it smell good, it is the only scent that does the job it is suppose to do.  I hope I can continue to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not good enough, still smell.</li>
    <li> I think this is discontinued.  I have only been able to find it on Amazon, so I have been stocking up.  It is my all time favorite deodorant.  I can miss a day and still have coverage</li>
    <li> this scent is almost impossible to find in stores now a days, my gf continued to tell me &amp;#34;i cant find my favorite brand of deodorant, bla bla bla&amp;#34; good thing i listen because when i gave her this she was really happy (but then mad because she then thought i only bought her the deodorant because she smells) haha. but if you use this brand this is a great scent to try.</li>
    <li> Why did Dove discontinue this item?  It works great and smells so good I won&#x27;t use perfume.  It has a wonderful fragrance, light and fresh.  I&#x27;ll keep ordering until they are all gone.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorante very light feel and lasts long with a fresh clean scent. Have been using for more than 2 years and still does the job.</li>
    <li> What the heck?  I thought I&#x27;d stock up on this while some was still available since Dove decided to discontinue this scent.  It smells like baby powder and NOT at all like the Energizing scent.  Exceptionally disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and find in comparison that Dove Go Fresh is the best for me.  It keeps perspiration and odor in check really well (I didn&#x27;t have that security with other products); glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t pull my skin.  Other bar deodorants are dry and drag when applied... my underarms hurt after using.  I just threw away one (sorry Arid) because I just wasn&#x27;t satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grapefruit and lemongrass scent was a big draw for me to purchase Dove to begin with, and the ease and quick delivery of ordering from Amazon put it over the top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second order of the Dove brand and it&#x27;s in my re-order list for Amazon.  I highly recommend Dove Go Fresh Energizing Antiperspirant/Deodorant (perhaps any fragrance - but Grapefruit/Lemongrass is my flavor of choice).</li>
    <li> I just love this deodorant! Smells so good. Everyone ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing because its smells so good people think is my perfume..;)</li>
    <li> This deodorant used to work well on me but that stopped. I had to switch to Secret PH Balance which is super awesome</li>
    <li> i liked the smell, i liked the protection. but in less than four months about $800 worth of black clothing is ruined. the armpits have collected the deodorant and are stained white. no amount of cleaning has removed it and it has become a horrible sticky film.  warning do not use with black clothing especially silk!&lt;br /&gt;i will not be using or recommending this product again</li>
    <li> Needed deodorant and thought I would try this unique fragrance that I had never seen at stores. It is lovely. Very subtle interesting and pleasant smell. And Dove deodorant is a great product. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love things that smell like grapefruit, so I really wanted to like this, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  I have used the green (cucumber?) kind of Dove for years so that&#x27;s my baseline.  I decided to try this for a new scent, but something about it ALREADY smells a little too similar to body odor.  So when I sweat at all, it doesn&#x27;t hold up, and it compounds the normal B.O. smell.  It&#x27;s fine for a day when I&#x27;m not doing much, but not at all okay for a day when I&#x27;m running around doing errands or going to the gym.  Unfortunately I bought a 4-pack but I&#x27;ll be going back to the green kind when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I love this product lemongrass scent. It&#x27;s last as long as the other antiperspirants and protect just as well. The combination of lemongrass and grapefruit are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Its hard to find this scent since it was discontinued.  I love the smell of it and it protects great too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product once at Walmart. When it was time to replenish I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to fresh scent and how it keeps me dry all day long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s discontinued. It&#x27;s long lasting, doesn&#x27;t cake up and the only deodorant that whose scent works perfectly with my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> $34.99 + $7.67 for shipping and handling for four sticks of deodorant???? You put this product on the shelves and took it right off again. I have been a faithful user of the entire grapefruit and lemongrass line for at least four years now and now you are seriously asking me to pay over ten dollars per stick of deodorant?!?! NO WAY!!! This can&#x27;t be found in any of my local stores anymore so I started buying through amazon a couple of years ago. If you can&#x27;t bring the price down, you will lose loyal customers like me. Please respond with an explanation and solution or you will lose, at minimum, 5 loyal consumers as my family, nor I will ever buy ANY of your products again. This is not how you show appreciation and respect to people who have been loyal to your brand.</li>
    <li> Hmm!!!  I have one of these in the en-suite, main bathroom, bathroom downstairs and my wardrobe - would never be without it.</li>
    <li> this IS JUST ONE LESS THING I HAVE TO GO TO THE STORE AND BUY. I GET THIS KIND OF STUFF ON HERE FOR A GREAT DEAL.</li>
    <li> great fragrance, works well.</li>
    <li> Other than this being expired  &amp; taking forever to get here, I&#x27;m super excited to have my favorite deodorant back!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only deorderant that works for me !!!!!!! I love it. This product is not sold anywhere in my local area.</li>
    <li> My favorite dove deodorant. They are unavailable in stores due to a shortage. Other online markets and eBay are selling this deodorant a bit higher than it would have cost in store.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodarant</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant I&#x27;ve ever bought. The scent is so appealing (is that not half of the deodorant struggle?). For me it smells like a summer morning by the shore with all of the windows open while folding super fresh laundry. It&#x27;s so wonderful. And it&#x27;s subtle, but distinct, and it mixes with other scents and perfumes pleasantly. The deodorant itself does a good job and has a really decent staying power, although sometimes it does act as more of a mask than an actual deodorizer.</li>
    <li> Dove deodorants are reliable, simple, exceptional, and a staple.  Buy.  (Whatever scents you like?  I buy the least pricey, but they&#x27;re all a&#x27;.okay.)</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores, so I will definitely keep buying here for a long time!</li>
    <li> cant buy in stores anymore, nice price too.</li>
    <li> I love this scent from Dove but it is getting harder to find in the stores for some reason. I was happy to find it here on Amazon!  I also purchased the body spray in the same scent.  Very clean, fresh smelling scent!</li>
