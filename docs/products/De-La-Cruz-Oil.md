    <li> De La Cruz in my opinion makes the best products. I have have tried different Almond Oils but always return to this brand,I will not buy any other brand in the future but De La Cruz. Wonderful for face and dry skin. Use only a drop or two on your face,you will notice glow and softer skin. It also seems to diminish those puffy under eye bags if used under eyes at night. I like this oil much better than Argan Oil. I also use their Arnica Ointment for bruises. Good Stuff!</li>
    <li> I would use it every night and it helps with dryness of my skin. It is a good product, and i would like it.</li>

    <li> Ok,  purchased this product  because of it Vitamin E.  I&#x27;ve had sensitive, oily skin and enlarged pores most all my life.  After I reached 40 in age my facial skin started to absorb and welcome moisturizer. I did some research and started washing my face with African Black Soap and combining small amounts of Shea Butter (melted)  and pure Aloe Vera Gel for moisture. My skin started to show some improvement.  My daughter stated that the raw Shea Butter fragrance was not that suitable.  Read some more reviews and found that Sweet Almond Oil is good for your skin and complexion.  I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my face (small amount) for 5 days, 3x a day and my pores shrunk in size and my complexion is brighter and smoother!  Adding, the aroma is awesome :-)&lt;br /&gt;Although, it is not indicated on this bottle but Sweet Almond Oil should be refrigerated after opening  put it in the refrig until next use. Stopped using Shea Butter and Aloe Vera on my face and only uses it for body moisture because it works great.  I&#x27;m not sure how it happen, but this combination of Sweet Almond Oil and Black Soap works nicely together for shrinking pores and smoother complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product a 5 stars.  Hope you find this product to be beneficial to you as well as it is for me.  I will keep you updated as the months goes on.  For those who have problematic skin, knows we spend a lot of money on facial skin products that says their product does the trick. I did and done it all, now it was time for me to go all natural. Give it a try, it good for you, not pricey and you can use it for other things like cooking and such... if you find its not working to your expectations.</li>
