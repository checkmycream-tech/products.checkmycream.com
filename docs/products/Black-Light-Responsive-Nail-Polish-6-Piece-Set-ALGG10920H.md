      <li>My daughter and her friends loved the polish also.</li>
      <li>Good job.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and superior quality!</li>
      <li>It is amazing to find any nail polish for under 7-10$</li>
      <li>:) :) :)</li>
      <li>Love the polish and it worked well.</li>
      <li>and i love the colors.</li>
      <li>and after polishing my nails and charging with light we were glowing baby!</li>
      <li>it was  the perfert addition for my daughter&#x27;s sweet 16 neon party!</li>
      <li>Dies not glow under UV light</li>
      <li>and they were amazed at their nails glowing under the Uv light.</li>
      <li>Even though it wasn&#x27;t as i expected, they&#x27;re really great</li>
      <li>Oh and packaged well, so no broken bottles and fit right in my mailbox so my mil lady didn&#x27;t have to ring my bell!</li>
      <li>The best colors were yellow &amp; pink.  </li>
      <li>SHE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE FUN WITH THE NAIL POLISH ...............</li>
      <li>The color is bright in the black light and in normal light.</li>
      <li>this item was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>It threw me off the first night I went to bed</li>
      <li>I am going to a rave August 11th and really wanted to be dressed colorful.</li>
      <li>It looks pretty cool under black lights, but in the daylight it&#x27;s not too cute.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast</li>
      <li>Although the orange in the set was getting pretty dry, all of the other cookies were fine!</li>
      <li>but they do glow in the dark after being exposed to light for a while.</li>
      <li>and I gave it to my 6 year old daughter!</li>
      <li>Did not glow in the black light</li>
      <li>I bought them because I entered the black light run 2014</li>
      <li>These are glow in the dark, NOT black light responsive.  </li>
      <li>But next time put in the information what it really is.</li>
      <li>Was not responisive to black light, when tried to return I couldn&#x27;t because a bottle was open.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a black light party, it isn&#x27;t as reactive to black light because I had to put at least 4 coats to get it to react</li>
      <li>It really glows in the dark!</li>

<li> A few days later my polish came, regular sized bottles (someone said the bottles were small????)</li>
<li> Contacted the seller who sent a replacement of that color, that bottle arrived in heavy protective packaging with the cap cracked so it can&#x27;t ever be closed.  </li>
<li> black</li>
<li> balck it dont work with a bit of light on :(</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> Cheap, terrible bottles and not UV-responsive.  </li>
<li> Apply two coats because it is thin.</li>
<li> but I received the wrong items, I made one call to Matt and he told me to keep the body paint that was sent</li>
<li> it was bad!!</li>

    <li> I GAVE THIS TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVED IT AT NIGHT SHE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE FUN WITH THE NAIL POLISH ............... :) :) :)</li>
    <li> Colors are very dull and don&#x27;t glow very well</li>
    <li> The colors have a translucent effect you need several coats or to have another solid color beneath but they do glow in the dark after being exposed to light for a while.</li>
    <li> Love the polish and it worked well. The best colors were yellow &amp; pink.  I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Was not responisive to black light, when tried to return I couldn&#x27;t because a bottle was open. How could you not open a bottle to find out it was bad!!</li>
    <li> I adore these nail polishes! I bought them because I entered the black light run 2014 and I wanted something on my fingers that glows! These worked great! Although the orange in the set was getting pretty dry, all of the other cookies were fine!</li>
    <li> this item was exactly what i was looking for. it was  the perfert addition for my daughter&#x27;s sweet 16 neon party!</li>
    <li> I am going to a rave August 11th and really wanted to be dressed colorful. It is amazing to find any nail polish for under 7-10$ but you get 4 for 10$ here which already makes it a perfect deal. The color is bright in the black light and in normal light. Apply two coats because it is thin.</li>
    <li> Did not glow in the black light</li>
    <li> its a bit rubbish only glowing in pitch black i not going to have a party in pitch balck it dont work with a bit of light on :(</li>
    <li> It really glows in the dark! I bought this for a black light party, it isn&#x27;t as reactive to black light because I had to put at least 4 coats to get it to react but it definitely glows in the dark. It threw me off the first night I went to bed and my nails were glowing.</li>
    <li> My daughter and her friends loved the polish also. We polished her and her friends nails and I took them to pump it up glow bounce and they were amazed at their nails glowing under the Uv light.</li>
    <li> The colors are very bright but it supposed to  be neon nail polish but it was not.it not as in the pic at all.nothing happens at nights.its just like a regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast but I received the wrong items, I made one call to Matt and he told me to keep the body paint that was sent and I gave it to my 6 year old daughter! A few days later my polish came, regular sized bottles (someone said the bottles were small????) and after polishing my nails and charging with light we were glowing baby! Matt, great customer service dude! I will shop with you again! A Kool Kat and great seller. Oh and packaged well, so no broken bottles and fit right in my mailbox so my mil lady didn&#x27;t have to ring my bell! Good job.</li>
    <li> Tried it… no luck.&lt;br /&gt;Used more… still no luck.&lt;br /&gt;Used still more… still NO LUCK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it in the trash.</li>
    <li> These are glow in the dark, NOT black light responsive.  My order came with one bottle (the one I was looking to use) cracked and spilled all over the others.  Contacted the seller who sent a replacement of that color, that bottle arrived in heavy protective packaging with the cap cracked so it can&#x27;t ever be closed.  Cheap, terrible bottles and not UV-responsive.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  Quick delivery and superior quality!</li>
    <li> It looks pretty cool under black lights, but in the daylight it&#x27;s not too cute.  Great for raves or strippers.</li>
    <li> Dies not glow under UV light</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was a glow-in-the-dark nail polish as said. Even though it wasn&#x27;t as i expected, they&#x27;re really great and i love the colors. But next time put in the information what it really is. Thanks</li>
