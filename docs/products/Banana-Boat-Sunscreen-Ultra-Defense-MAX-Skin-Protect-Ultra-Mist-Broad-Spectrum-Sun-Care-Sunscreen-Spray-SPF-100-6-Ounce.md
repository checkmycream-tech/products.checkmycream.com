      <li>Great protection - Kid Proof - Easy to use - Great price!</li>
      <li>Feels good on and protects.</li>
      <li>We were there for six hours, and shaded for a good part of that time.  </li>
      <li>Good cost and benefit</li>
      <li>and I love the fact that it is SPF 110!</li>
      <li>Amazing...</li>
      <li>I really liked this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This makes it so very easy to re apply.</li>
      <li>I did get a light sunburn over my shoulders, but all in all it was good.</li>
      <li>By far the best sun screen I have used!</li>
      <li>Banana Boat Ultra Defense UltraMist is by far the best sunscreen on the market.</li>
      <li>So I was pretty happy when I found it online.  </li>
      <li>Great product fast delivery I recommend to all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the top.</li>
      <li>I doubt anything is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg</li>
      <li>Even after spraying, I always make sure to rub it around for any areas I can reach.  </li>
      <li>this is the top one.</li>
      <li>I think if I had reapplied it more often it would have worked even better for me.</li>
      <li>often settle for a good pool or beach right here in the east where I</li>
      <li>An easy solution is to spray it into your hand with the can up-side-down...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on in a spray so easily and neatly.</li>
      <li>I love that I can just spray it on, I even do a great job of spraying my back!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it in a few strengths but the 110 is best for me.  </li>
      <li>Overall, Im happy with it and will probably buy it again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since it is a spray - it&#x27;s fairly easy to get it on my own back - so that is a plus for sports, etc</li>
      <li>but this is optional and you would still get adequate coverage from just the spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With this product I found that the aloe quickly hydrates my skin, and the sunscreen helps me from burning.</li>
      <li>I applied it about once every 3 or 4 hours while I was out in the sun and only got slightly red, which is very very good for me!</li>
      <li>I can spray myself or children quickly and thoroughly without wasting any product.</li>
      <li>The spray is really easy to use, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling very greasy.</li>
      <li>So, maybe not so good if you have arthritis or other hand issues.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it comes right out.</li>
      <li>My skin is really sensitive, and most sunscreens really bother me.  </li>
      <li>This was a very challenging environment with regard to the extreme amount of sun and this spray came through with flying colors.</li>
      <li>Most dermatologists would tell you that anything above 45 SPF is unnecessary, but its nice to know that 110 SPF is more than adequate protection on hot sunny days.</li>
      <li>The spray nozzle was a little temperamental in the first twenty sprays, but now it&#x27;s all good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn it out in the desert at high altitudes all day in full sun and have come back with no color - just the way I like it. :-)  </li>
      <li>I spent a lot of time in the sun and, with two applications/day this sunblock worked spectacularly well.</li>
      <li>So, when using it, make sure there&#x27;s actually liquid coming out - if it isn&#x27;t - just reposition and press again.  </li>
      <li>but it does apply better for some areas such as ears.</li>
      <li>I thought this suncreen worked pretty well for me and my family.</li>
      <li>I can reapply many times and not get totally grossed out by it on my skin.</li>
      <li>I am going back to Coopertone Sport which my family has used for many years with NO sunburns.</li>
      <li>have recommended this product to numerous people and they love it tooo.</li>
      <li>I found this product a few years ago and it works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I tried this product last summer and fell in love....</li>
      <li>I live in a very sunny area with high UV and need all the protection available.  </li>
      <li>I never burned and, after 10 days, only got a very mild tan.</li>
      <li>I typically rub in the sunscreen right after spraying to insure a more even application</li>
      <li>Also, much cheaper to buy here on Amazon than in drug stores.</li>
      <li>Very pleased.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I really felt protected by the suns harmful rays...</li>
      <li>For one thing; while I appreciate that it protects even when wet, I would like to be able to wash it off at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;110 SPF with broad spectrum protection ensures that my family&#x27;s skin is adequately protected.</li>
      <li>live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am older and take medications for which I must protect myself from the sun and of course sun burn or sun poisoning or Melanoma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mainly ordered it because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I thought I would try a new product with a high SPF</li>
      <li>My 4 yr old Grand Daughter had over a half a can put on her in one afternoon!</li>
      <li>After reading in Consumer Reports that this was the top rated sunscreen, I bought several spray bottles to use when was at Burning Man in the Black Rock Desert for 10 days.</li>
      <li>I have very pale skin and burn easily, so I needed something with a high SPH rating.</li>
      <li>In the Florida sun it&#x27;s a must for me, I am over 50 yrs old.</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s been working.  </li>
      <li>I have very pail skin and red hair.</li>
      <li>The only issue I found was as it gets below half full, it is more difficult to get out.  </li>
      <li>thin, non sticky great sunscreen.invisible on, hardly any aroma.</li>
      <li>I finally realized you press straight down - now it&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Will definitely buy from again. This is a slight odor but nothing I&#x27;m not used to. I work 10 to 12 hours outside everyday around oils, fluids, and gas so the smell is barely even noticed, at least to me. This is definitely a must.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the only one I have found that actually protects my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash or make me break out.  My skin is really sensitive, and most sunscreens really bother me.  I haven&#x27;t burned in the 6 months I have been using it.  The only issue I found was as it gets below half full, it is more difficult to get out.  An easy solution is to spray it into your hand with the can up-side-down... it comes right out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very, very pale with very sensitive skin that get irritated by almost any lotion - especially ones listed as &#x27;for sensitive skin.&#x27; I am always searching for a sunscreen I can slather on that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I found this product a few years ago and it works pretty good.  I&#x27;ve tried it in a few strengths but the 110 is best for me.  Without sunscreen I can start to burn in 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work.  I&#x27;ve worn it out in the desert at high altitudes all day in full sun and have come back with no color - just the way I like it. :-)  I&#x27;ve also worn it swimming a few times lately - I apply just before getting in the water and just after.  So far, it&#x27;s been working.  Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The button is a little awkward until you get used to it.  Initially, I thought you rocked/tilted the button and I always struggled to get any spray to come out.  I finally realized you press straight down - now it&#x27;s not a problem.  It can get a little awkward doing it left handed - so it does require a little strength - but not that much.  So, maybe not so good if you have arthritis or other hand issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a spray - it&#x27;s fairly easy to get it on my own back - so that is a plus for sports, etc when you don&#x27;t necessarily have a friend around to help you apply it to the hard to reach areas.  Even after spraying, I always make sure to rub it around for any areas I can reach.  Also, you can get it to &#x27;spray&#x27; so just air comes out and no sunscreen.  So, when using it, make sure there&#x27;s actually liquid coming out - if it isn&#x27;t - just reposition and press again.  I wonder if that is why someone got burned using this??  Same issue with any aerosol - so just use your common sense here.  Something needs to come out for it to work.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing is that it isn&#x27;t very irritating to the skin. Yes, I still would rather NOT be wearing it but it doesn&#x27;t give me a rash like some sunscreens do.  And, it doesn&#x27;t feel quite as pour clogging as lotion sunscreens do.  Not sure it is because of the Aloe - or if I&#x27;m just taken in by the marketing - but I will take what I can get.  I can reapply many times and not get totally grossed out by it on my skin.</li>
    <li> The Caribbean is where I want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often settle for a good pool or beach right here in the east where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am older and take medications for which I must protect myself from the sun and of course sun burn or sun poisoning or Melanoma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does it all at 110 SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on in a spray so easily and neatly. No rubbing in or rubbing on. Simply spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes it so very easy to re apply. Its just NO FUSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top of the line here on protection.</li>
    <li> Takes a little while to figure out how to get a continuous stream going—I got a little burnt by the sun yesterday in random streaks on my skin where I wasn&#x27;t able to spray, but the parts that did get sprayed were certainly protected. The spray nozzle was a little temperamental in the first twenty sprays, but now it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> We bought this for a day at the beach in SE Texas. The button on the spray is very difficult to press down. Despite reapplying a couple times we still ended up with some pretty nasty sunburns!!! Will not use again...ever!</li>
    <li> I thought this suncreen worked pretty well for me and my family. I have very pale skin and burn easily, so I needed something with a high SPH rating. The spray is really easy to use, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling very greasy. I applied it about once every 3 or 4 hours while I was out in the sun and only got slightly red, which is very very good for me! I always burn! I think if I had reapplied it more often it would have worked even better for me. Overall, Im happy with it and will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the worse product ever!!! My son and I got the worse sunburn. It is like we didnt have any protection on. We kept spraying this all day at the beach. We didnt go in the water and was in the shade for a bit too. I am going back to Coopertone Sport which my family has used for many years with NO sunburns. I thought I would try a new product with a high SPF but now I learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> I used this for a week in Cancun and followed the directions.  Everyone else looked like lobsters but I looked like I hadn&#x27;t left Seattle!  I know, not great for sun worshipers but since I have been one and paid the price, I will use this now!</li>
    <li> I really liked this sunscreen. I saw that others had issues with it, but I think this is a great product. Also, much cheaper to buy here on Amazon than in drug stores.</li>
    <li> Works great. Non greasy finish, I use it all the time when out fishing.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery I recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I personally suspect this stuff would block anything short of small arms fire. I doubt anything is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg</li>
    <li> Bought this instead of our usual brand and used it for the first time today. We all burned, including my 20mo baby. This stuff is awful!!</li>
    <li> Number one ranked by a well-known consumer organization, I was sorely disappointed in this product. For one thing; while I appreciate that it protects even when wet, I would like to be able to wash it off at the end of the day. I don&#x27;t appreciate smelling of sunscreen two days later. I also found the spray to be a problem. Perhaps I&#x27;m not a fan of spray-on sunscreen, but this spray splatters and goes everywhere. It&#x27;s not easily aimed at just your skin, and it gets on everything. I would definitely use this product only at the beach or poolside - not in the house or in the car, and definitely not with designer swimwear or clothing.</li>
    <li> My 4 yr old Grand Daughter had over a half a can put on her in one afternoon! That enening she was VERY RED! The NEXT DAY my Daughter had to take her to the Dr. due to Blisters were already apperaing on her Shoulder! Long Story Short. She has been through total HELL! Second-Third Degree Burn. Been knocked out at the Hospital to have it Cleaned DEEPLY due to the infection that set in, in a Matter of hours! She has to see a Burm Spec. for PT! She is Terrified to go outside, in fear that she will get burned again! She starts school this year and will not beable to go outside untill we can work her through her fears! Would You Believe that the Company had the Nerve to send her Coupons for more of their CRAP!!!!!!!! I hope that this COMPANY Goes out of BUSINESS!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as traditional lotion sunblock.  We are switching back to traditional sunblock.</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skinned woman living on Guam, I swim every morning and use this product before I enter the pool!  I love that I can just spray it on, I even do a great job of spraying my back!  I do have to let it dry before entering the pool otherwise it comes off, I see a film surrounding me, but it just takes a minute or two to dry, so no big deal!  Banana Boat products are thee Best Sunscreen products I have ever used. I&#x27;ve had basal cell lesions removed from my back so I have to be very careful in the sun and this product is a must!</li>
    <li> Cancer saver.  Great reviews in consumer reports.  this is the top one.</li>
    <li> I work out doors and use this sun screen all summer long.. By far the best sun screen I have used! Did not leave that greasy feeling too skin!</li>
    <li> stains anything white</li>
    <li> !00 SPF seems like overkill to some. I have olive skin, I still &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; while using this product. In the Florida sun it&#x27;s a must for me, I am over 50 yrs old.</li>
    <li> No problems with this product.  I didn&#x27;t use it extensively.  Mainly ordered it because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports.  I live in a very sunny area with high UV and need all the protection available.  I am not really a fan of spray on sunscreen but it does apply better for some areas such as ears.</li>
    <li> When I get a sunburn within 24-48 hours it turns into a tan. With this product I found that the aloe quickly hydrates my skin, and the sunscreen helps me from burning. This is the only sunscreen I use and I love the fact that it is SPF 110!</li>
    <li> Used it every day on vacation in Destin, Florida. I never burned. I had skin cancer removed from the side of my face 2 years ago. I highly recommend this product. Check its rating on Consumer Reports. It&#x27;s the top.</li>
    <li> We bought this to test it out before sending it to camp with our daughter.  We used it at the water park.  We were there for six hours, and shaded for a good part of that time.  We applied every two hours, per directions.  My husband looks like I applied nothing on him at all.  My kids are burned.  I am burned, albeit slightly less severely.  I have never used a worse sunscreen.  For spray, we&#x27;ll go back to Neutrogena Cooling Effects.  Otherwise, we&#x27;re back to using mineral blocks.</li>
    <li> I applied it twice during a four-five hour outing. I did get a light sunburn over my shoulders, but all in all it was good.</li>
    <li> Feels good on and protects.</li>
    <li> Amazing... Good cost and benefit</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver! I am a life guard and work all summer long in the sun. I have very pail skin and red hair. I burn when just walking to mailbox.....I tried this product last summer and fell in love....I do not get burnt and I am not greasy. How ever it does stain my white t shirts. Will never change products. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to numerous people and they love it tooo.</li>
    <li> thin, non sticky great sunscreen.invisible on, hardly any aroma.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Ultra Defense UltraMist is by far the best sunscreen on the market. Over the past several years I have tested everything from Neutrogena to organic products like Kiss My Face. This product by Banana Boat blew them all out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION&lt;br /&gt;The misting bottle makes application a breeze. I can spray myself or children quickly and thoroughly without wasting any product. I typically rub in the sunscreen right after spraying to insure a more even application but this is optional and you would still get adequate coverage from just the spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROTECTION&lt;br /&gt;110 SPF with broad spectrum protection ensures that my family&#x27;s skin is adequately protected. Most dermatologists would tell you that anything above 45 SPF is unnecessary, but its nice to know that 110 SPF is more than adequate protection on hot sunny days. The product also includes Banana Boat&#x27;s AvoTriplex for optimal protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NICE FEATURES&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight &amp; Rub-free&lt;br /&gt;Very Water Resistant&lt;br /&gt;Enriched with Aloe Vera and Vitamin A &amp; E&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use 6 fl oz spray can&lt;br /&gt;Twist n Lock Spray, No Cap to lose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this sunscreen. Great protection - Kid Proof - Easy to use - Great price!</li>
    <li> I just used it today and maybe its all in my head but I really felt protected by the suns harmful rays...lol...but maybe I haven&#x27;t been looking in the wrong stores but I can&#x27;t find sunscreens that go up to 110.  So I was pretty happy when I found it online.  Will mos def buy this product again from this seller.</li>
    <li> After reading in Consumer Reports that this was the top rated sunscreen, I bought several spray bottles to use when was at Burning Man in the Black Rock Desert for 10 days. I spent a lot of time in the sun and, with two applications/day this sunblock worked spectacularly well. I never burned and, after 10 days, only got a very mild tan. My skin had no adverse reaction to the spray (this is not to say that yours won&#x27;t) and the smell was not pronounced. This was a very challenging environment with regard to the extreme amount of sun and this spray came through with flying colors. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We purchased 2 cans of this sunscreen to take on a trip to Aruba for a week. We should have bought 3 but supplimented with an SPF 50 in our day bags. Both of us are pasty white and didn&#x27;t burn on our beach trip!</li>
