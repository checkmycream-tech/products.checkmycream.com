<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have never tried whitening strips before. The strips work...go for the 2 hour treatment.</li>
    <li> Between red wine and coffee, I&#x27;ve been needing/wanting to whiten my teeth for the past year. I had used trays from my dentist years ago and had major sensitivity with only a few treatments. So, I was very sceptical in trying to whiten again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness I read reviews and didn&#x27;t go with the more expensive, popular strips; which many people made comment to having sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 7/14 packs over the last week or so and have much whiter teeth already and NO pain whatsoever! Plus, I&#x27;ve only needed to wear them for a half hour to an hour at a time and have great results. Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia W.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my product. The strips aren&#x27;t flimsy as crest white strips and grips on your teeth well. This made it so much easier to whiten my teeth during the day. And like other posts, it didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive as crest white strips did. I&#x27;ve only tried 4 strips so far, but I&#x27;ve already seeing improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the stripes for a few days now and have noticed a difference.  My only complaint is with the packaging. The stripes are kind of sticky on both sides so it can be difficult pulling them out of the wrapper.</li>
    <li> Did nothing at all to whiten my teeth and I am not a smoker and do not drink coffee. I naively believed that a $25.00 product could do what a $300 treatment at a dentists office could do.  It was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> So far, it seems these white strips work okay - I&#x27;m just not a fan of the length of time you&#x27;re expected to leave them on.  Most of the major name brands say to leave on for 30 minutes.  These ones are one to two hours per day!</li>
    <li> I have always had to space out Crest Whiteships over a month because they made my teeth hurt so bad. So far I&#x27;ve had little to no pain and my teeth are on their way to being white for the summer! Just make sure you don&#x27;t brush your teeth directly before wearing the strips, or you will get a little sensitivity (at least that was the only time I did). It&#x27;s not a professional dentist job but it&#x27;s just as good as Crest!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I just did my first day, left them on for an hour and I swear my teeth are already noticeably whiter after 1 use. My teeth weren&#x27;t bad, but i drink a good amount of coffee and just noticed that they weren&#x27;t as bright as in the past. The strips don&#x27;t slip on the teeth at all either. Definitely will buy this brand from now on!</li>
    <li> These work very well and most importantly stay on much better than any of the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great improvement over the slippery sliding Crest strips and not as heavy and uncomfortable as the stiff waxy type strips. These really adhere well and don&#x27;t slide around.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve never used white strips before,this will be my first time  The most important is that the service is incredibly good!  i will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t hurt, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Stay on well and don&#x27;t cause any sensitivity like some of the others. Really love these and will purchase again</li>
    <li> These are just as great as the name brands and at half the price. I have used the strips three times and I see a significant difference.</li>
    <li> leaves heavy residue once strip is removed,rinses off fairly well</li>
    <li> Work good. Very Sticky.</li>
    <li> The strips adhere better than others I&#x27;ve tried, which is a plus. The instructions are in German, which is a negative. Whitens as advertised. Here&#x27;s the hitch: the company offered me a refund if I gave the product a positive review. &amp;#34;If you were satisfied with our product, just write a positive customer review directly on http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SGBTOYI and we&#x60;ll give you a full refund as a thank you for your time spent with writing down your thoughts. It&#x60;s so easy!&amp;#34; Which means to say many of the glowing reviews you read here are undoubtedly paid for.</li>
    <li> These strips do a great job and at a price far below its more well-known commercially available counterpart.</li>
    <li> Great product. I like these better than Crest. No sensitivity either. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I found that these didn&#x27;t really whiten my teeth, and it was annoying that I had to leave them on for an hour.  They also left me with great sensitivity which I never experienced from other leading brands.  Overall, I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference just within a few days of using the strips ! I defiantly recommend.</li>
    <li> This works really well and whitened my teeth after only 1 usage.</li>
    <li> The Onuge whitening strips did a great job at whitening my teeth and improving the appearance of my smile. After the first use, I noticed a difference. So far, I have used half of the strips and my smile is very white. I left the strips on for an hour at a time and didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity afterwords. Like other reviewers have said, they do stick a little to the teeth and are slightly difficult to remove but I think this is a positive quality! They stick to the teeth much better than other whitening strips I have tried, which usually fall off. At the price, this is an affordable and effective whitening treatment!</li>
    <li> Made my teeth white after using 2 strips! Hope that&#x27;s a good thing..Thinking it is.</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic! I noticed a difference after 2 uses. The strips stick to my teeth without slipping off and I only have to wear them for an hour. The strips do not leave a bad taste in your mouth either. I would buy this product again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> Only used it once and already can tell a big difference!! :-) :-) :-)</li>
    <li> The best white strips I&#x27;ve tried so far. Thin, easy strips I can talk while wearing. Pleasant taste and doesn&#x27;t make my teeth ache after. Have to wear a little longer than others, but I forget I&#x27;m wearing them about 5 minutes into it.</li>
    <li> the BEST tooth whitener available.  I have tried over 15 types of trays, strips, you name it - and I saw a difference with these in just 2 applications.  Also, unlike crest, they actually stick to your teeth and don&#x27;t slide.  100% recommend.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It is priced very well and it works wonderfully.  After applying the strips to my teeth and waiting about an hour, they peel off easily and my teeth improve in whiteness.  I highly recommend them and the seller!</li>
    <li> These strips stick to my teeth and are very difficult to remove.  Once they come off with great effort, there is a residue on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like that this company wants to give me my money back if I give them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> First let me say I was not paid for this review.  I am a senior that thought I had to live with yellowing teeth.  This product did it&#x27;s job!  My teeth whitened more with each use.  It was a little sticky when you remove the strips but that rinses right off! It was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve written on Amazon, but my first is a VERY positive review for Onuge whitestrips....I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands and these feel better, work better, and are cheaper.  What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> Results were noticeable after 1-2 uses. Strongly recommend! These strips do not make my teeth more sensitive. They stick right to your teeth and work great. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find any trace of this company Onuge actually existing, lol, but the bottom line is that their product flat works. You&#x27;ll notice a change after the 1st use!</li>
    <li> I did not see much of a difference in my teeth. the strips are too think like putting a bandaid on your teeth</li>
    <li> Half the price of Brand named whiteners. Works better!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. Price was less than most others, but quality is great. I&#x27;ve used others that are hard to put on and slip around too much. These stay put and I&#x27;ve seen results after a few days. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for some decent results. I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips before and, after using the entire package, my teeth were noticeably whiter and the effect lasted at least a year. With these Onuge ones, I see no difference, at all. My teeth appeared whiter right after taking these strips off, but they just go back to their &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; color the next day. I&#x27;m legitimately confused as to how this thing gets a 4.5 rating on Amazon.  The only thing these strips have going for them is that they do not make your teeth sensitive like the Crest ones, do. However, that benefit is overlooked by the fact that they plain aren&#x27;t effective at removing stains.</li>
    <li> After 3 uses my teeth are bright and white ! The best ,is that I didn&#x27;t have the sensitivity that I had with crest strips. The price is great too!</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. No sensitivity at all. Which is usually a problem for me. I&#x27;ve only used twice and am already seeing noticeable results. And they&#x27;re half the price of crest. I&#x27;ll be using these exclusively from now on.</li>
    <li> I received my order in a very timely manner.  I have only started using this product 4 days ago and can ALREADY see an improvement in the color of my teeth.  I am VERY satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to get whiter teeth !!</li>
    <li> These stick so well! No problems with placement while in use - in fact, if anything it took effort to remove them. Only had sensitivity once for about 5 minutes, felt like it went all the way down to the roots in one area of the mouth. Other than that one time (it was the first use), never had a problem. Will plan to buy these again if need be.</li>
    <li> I bought one box for me and one for my daughter, my daughter&#x27;s teeth got very white after her third time of one to two hours she left them on, for me i had to do four times and I left them on for two hours each time wow my teeth look nice and white I recomend this to anyone that wants to whiten their teeth and dont need to spend much.</li>
    <li> I always use crest whitening strips and have been very picky about trying anything else because I know they work for me. But, being a college kid, I really didn&#x27;t have money to splurge on for the strips I always get. So I looked at amazons highest rated other options and I stumbled upon these! Although skeptical at first because I have never seen this brand before, I am so glad I listened to the reviews about them! Only downfall about the strips is they don&#x27;t taste very good and you have to brush off the sticky residue when you take them off. However, they for sure stay on your teeth and don&#x27;t slide which I LOVED. And after the 1st strip, you instantly see results! After doing all of the pack on my teeth, they were perfect and its a fraction of what I normally pay. If not they did better than the crest strips I always use and didn&#x27;t leave my teeth sensitive. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Purchased these based on other&#x27;s reviews, versus Crest, which was quite higher in cost.  Have only used 2 times, but teeth are already whiter!  I especially like the way they actually stick to your teeth and don&#x27;t slip around!  I have sensitive teeth and, so far, haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity with these strips.  Try them!  What do you have to lose, except stained teeth?</li>
    <li> Easy to use, nice results and great price. No problems with sensitivity which I have had in the past with other products.</li>
    <li> these strips work great, actually stick solidly to your teeth and you will notice an immediate difference from this product! I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t sit on the fence about this product. Far superior than Crest Supreme. It&#x27;s the no slip technology and whitening ability. I have used just about every product under the Sun for whitening. I finally settled on this and am glad I did. The results are quick and obvious.</li>
    <li> I have used  Crest Whitestrips for many, many years. I HATED the pain but wanted white teeth, so I kept using them.  I decided to try these because of the great reviews  and I am so happy that I did! First, they stay on great,  and THEY ACTUALLY WORK!  I  noticed my teeth whiter after just one use (and my teeth are already white), and NO PAIN!  Love these strips, and the price is a lot better than what I was paying!  Bravo!</li>
    <li> After one application, I saw a visible improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.  It tasted okay, and stayed in position until I removed it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Was leary at first to buy since known name is crest, however, am happy with product.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet that they have the whitening potential of Crest, but they definitely stay put which is a BIG plus! So far, very satisfied. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I can see the difference after just using one time :-)</li>
    <li> My teeth are super slippery clean and white, with just one treatment of these fabulous whitening strips !&lt;br /&gt;By the time I finish all of the treatments, my smile will look like I had it professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;I had an appointment today to get my teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;The dentist assistant that cleans my teeth highly recommends them, and has used them herself !&lt;br /&gt;The whitening is a beautiful natural white, and so easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;I have nice teeth, but due to getting older, I noticed they were not as white as before.&lt;br /&gt;Now, thanks to this product, I can look forward to always having that bright white teeth smile.</li>
    <li> I went off the good reviews and decided to give this product a try. I used one time and can already see a noticeable difference!&lt;br /&gt;I have used Crest Whitestrips in the past and it took a few times before I could see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see the final result if I am already seeing instant results :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot cheaper than Crest and faster results... SOLD!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these twice for a little over an hour each day and no pain! I mostly chose them because crest white strips leave my teeth so sensitive, but so far these are great. Excited to continue use and see my teeth get even whiter!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t stick to teeth- have tried brushing first and not brushing and either way they do not stick for more than 1 minute-God do I hate products that cost money and don&#x27;t do what they are supposed to-I don&#x27;t even care if they actually whiten my teeth-will never find out if I can&#x27;t even get them to stick to them (and all others I have tried do so I don&#x27;t have like weird teeth..product sucks</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I saw results after the first use. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for my teeth. I used one complete box and did not notice any change. I bought 2 boxes and returned one.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!  One use and i already see a difference!  Best ever!!</li>
    <li> Tried this out and feel iffy about the product. The strip wasn&#x27;t difficult to apply to my teeth and did stay in place. The problem is the strip did not stick evenly to my teeth, meaning that it did not stick and stay on to the the ends of my teeth, where two teeth are touching. It stuck to the main surface of the tooth, which is fine, except it only whitens where the strip has contact-this means if any saliva gets under the strip, which WILL happen, those spots won&#x27;t be whitened. I will say that I did keep pressing the strip down into my teeth crevices to try to combat this, but it didn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect this had on my teeth was that the perimeter of the tooth on the sides stayed the same, and the center of the tooth was whitened. Clearly this is not the desired effect. Also, there were some whiter spots on the whitenened areas that stood out, but they faded after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like since it doesn&#x27;t whiten evenly, I am not going to continue to use the product. I&#x27;m too worried that my teeth will end up being patchy looking.</li>
    <li> Awesome strips! I did experience a little bit of sensitivity the first time I used them, but very tolerable- especially considering the results!</li>
    <li> This definitely works..!!! After 3 applications you can see the results. The price is great too. Every night, set your alarm to have a full 1 hour, and you&#x27;ll see the results…!!! Enjoy it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s me, but after using these, the front part of my tongue, my lips, and my gums were numb for 3 weeks.  Has anyone else had this feeling?  I tossed them afterwards.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!!  I saw the difference after one use.  I will definitely use these again and again!!  Better than Crest for sure!</li>
    <li> Great white strip for the price! I like these better then the crest 3D.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS! IT DOES NOT WORK! IT GAVE ME SO MUCH PAIN TO MY TEETH ON THE FIRST TRY!!!!! DANGEROUS! DO NOT TRUST THIS!!!! I HATED IT AND I HAD PAIN AND A GREAT AMOUNT OF SENSITIVITY ! EVEN WHENI WAS SIMPLY BREATHING IN AIR THROUGH MY MOUTH, IT HURT LIKE HELL! I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS AT ALL! VERY DISAPPOINTED AND THEY DID NOT GIVE ME A REFUND AT ALL!!!!!!!! Buy crest strips or something but no where near this! Yeah cheaper than most but it doesn&#x27;t work at all! And it makes your teeth hurt a lot!!!!</li>
    <li> These strips worked well and the price was right.</li>
    <li> These are great. They are cheaper than Crest white strips which I have used for years. They stay on better. They whiten just as well. They actually TASTE better and I had no sensitivity issues. My daughter recommended these, and I&#x27;m glad she did. I will be buying these from now on.</li>
    <li> Working great after 3 days!! They stay secure and I can see a difference already.</li>
    <li> This product is even better than the Crest 3D Advanced Whitestrips that are much more expensive!!  As an added bonus, this product doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive for hours afterwards like the Crest Whitestrips... I&#x27;m so pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Works as well as more expensive brands!</li>
    <li> Have used the product for the last 4 days. Works as well as if not better than the Crest strips and the price is less. Will continue to utilize this product in the future. Geno</li>
    <li> Great product. Worked as well as the crest strips I have used before but without any tooth sensitivity! Great price and was delivered in less than a week. Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> Really sticks to your teeth.  You need to use a toothbrush to get all the gel off after.  Teeth looked whiter, but only one shade.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as crest white strips! Love the minty taste. Glad I tried it. I will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> I have used CREST strips for years. Sorry but these are NOT doing the job. I can tell a difference after using 2 or 3 CREST strips. I am not seeing a big difference with these after 5 uses</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on day 13, and I have noticed that my teeth are one shade lighter, according to the included color guide.  Truthfully, I was expecting more dramatic results (2-3 shades lighter), hence the 2 star review.  But, in fairness, my expectations may have been unrealistic.  I have been using my Onuge Whitestrips faithfully for 13 days.  There are some great characteristics of this product - namely that I have only experienced sensitivity one day.  I used Sensodyne toothpaste, and that ended my sensitivity problem.  Also, these stuck to my teeth really well.  As others mentioned, they do leave behind a gluey residue but if you brush your teeth, that problem is remedied quickly.  They do put a gluey, minty taste in your mouth; not the best.  But, you can drink water while using these strips which helps significantly to manage the taste.  I used each night for 1.5-2 hours.  With this kind of use, I was anticipating a better result.  For the price, I&#x27;m not completely disappointed, but I will try a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> I love it. They arrive earlier than supposed to. And they working pretty good. I completely satisfied</li>
    <li> I really liked them. however, since I try to keep my teeth white, I&#x27;m not sure how much whiter they actually got...hard to tell.</li>
    <li> These really work!  And, they are not as expensive as the other whitestrips.  I will buy this product from now on--unless they raise the price.  But, it is good value for the money.  Also, good for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I know the Crest3D White is more expensive but it actually works. I don&#x27;t know what else to say. Just remember, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These strips are much more cost-efficient than the higher priced name brand. The result is the same for less money. The kit includes a whitening guide to see how much your teeth color has changed. The strips are easy to put on and easy to remove. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better quality product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I read a how a lot of people think the high reviews are fake and that it seems like a scam. I just want to say that I bought them to try and they work just as good if not better than the more expensive Crest strips. I&#x27;ve used them for a week now and it&#x27;s VERY noticeable how much whiter they got!</li>
    <li> These stay put and whiten!</li>
    <li> Slightly whitened, but to keep them on the whole 2 hours was a gooey mess that I had a hard time sustaining.  Didn&#x27;t make my teeth any more sensitive-bonus.  Just not the WOW factor I was hoping for.  Going to try  Crest Whitestrips  next.</li>
    <li> These strips work.great. No discomfort, does notmake teeth or gums sensitive but holds firm.</li>
    <li> Awful. Unusable. Crispy hard strips. Garbage</li>
    <li> The goo leaks out and gets all over my mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal crest whitestrips user, and didn&#x27;t think there was a better product on the market untill I tried Onuge strips. What I love about them is the fact that they stick to your teeth and you don&#x27;t get that peroxide taste in your mouth the whole time they are in. Also, now three days in I don&#x27;t have any sensitivity where with crest I had to take a day or two break inbetween uses. I&#x27;m seeing results already and love the fact that my teeth don&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m excited to order these again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used only 4 so far and my teeth are noticeably whiter than before. I leave the strips on for about 90 minutes each time and brush the residue off after each application. So far I am satisfied with the result especially considering how convenient it is to use these strips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few times, and so far am happy with the results.  The strips adhere well, have a pleasant taste, and don&#x27;t impact my speaking.  I have sensitive teeth and only noticed a little sensitivity to the product.  For the price I would recommend.</li>
    <li> expensive there&#x27;s other cheaper products that does a better job</li>
    <li> Love this product! I actually used Crest whitening strips a couple years ago and it did a fairly good job, but it took the use of the whole box to accomplish whiter teeth. I just used this product for the first time yesterday morning and only had it on my teeth for an hour, but it whitened my teeth several shades whiter and brighter than the whole box of Crest strips ever did!! This is amazing!! Definitely recommend, especially if you only have an hour or so to get ready for a big event and you want fast results for whiter teeth!!!</li>
    <li> love this product, way better than Crest</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use. I was excited and ready to use the product but everytime I tried they would not stick to my teeth and they were getting stuck to my hands and rolling. I followed the directions and I ruined 5 days worth for one day and couldn&#x27;t get any of them to work. I honestly would like a full refund and would not reccomend. I should have gotten the crest or colgate brand but never again.</li>
    <li> First, I was not paid or given a refund to write this review. This is my honest feedback to the Onuge Whitestrips. They are fantastic. They adhere so much better to your teeth than Crest Whitestrips. Sure, they are a little hard to remove (just use some water and pull them off carefully), but I didn&#x27;t have a problem. I have used them three times so far, an hour each time, and have seen drastic results. My teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter. Fast and noticeable results! I will say that after you remove the strips, you&#x27;ll definitely have a gummy residue on your teeth, so just brush them afterwards. The amazing thing is there is no sensitivity. My teeth felt no discomfort what so ever nor sensitivity. Amazing and promising white strips!! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better success with other brands.</li>
    <li> Day 14 and no results.</li>
    <li> At first i didnt think these product was working.  However after the first to application i did begin seeing a significant improvement in my appearance.  The strips can be a little bit hard to apply and get out of the package at times.  I have not experiance ant sensetivity  issues</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT product. These strips are minty and not messy. The peroxide does not leak and the strips adhere tightly. I have extremely sensitive gums that the gel made painful. I have no such issues with these strips. I&#x27;ve used them for a week and my teeth are noticeably whiter. I’m a former smoker that still drinks coffee every day.  HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> Great whitening strips. Noticed a difference after first use. Definitely better than the expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Not that great. I even left it on for an hour and only notice a slight change. Dont waste your money..</li>
    <li> Yeah these don&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these, just pay the extra few dollars for 3D Crest Whitestrips, they&#x27;re worth the price.. These don&#x27;t work AND they&#x27;re hard to take off.</li>
    <li> Work well, no sensitivity, and tolerable to wear for an hour!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write feedbacks but since I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this product I thought maybe I should&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 10 days 30mins per day and there isn&#x27;t any noticeable difference !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my teeth felt different in a good way that&#x27;s why I give it 3 stars</li>
    <li> The strips adhere to the teeth and stay in place much better than any other strips I have ever used.  I have used them for a few days now and I think that I can see that my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
    <li> This product works well without pain which I have with other similar products. Really love it!</li>
    <li> I have used other products for whiter teeth but by far this is the best.  I have only used it twice and I can already see a difference.  I also like that it does not irritate my mouth like some others have done.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> better there crest no sensitivity</li>
    <li> I drink A LOT of iced tea in the summertime, and stains my teeth like crazy.  I have tried other teeth whitening products, but none have ever worked as well as this one.  The only problem I&#x27;ve ever had is that when peeling the strips off the plastic holder, they sometimes want to curl up on themselves and when they do it&#x27;s hard or impossible to unstick them and you&#x27;re left with some folds/lumps at the end.  There was a learning curve for me to keep this from happening, but I eventually got the hang of it.  Not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, the best teeth whitening strips I&#x27;ve ever used, and value priced.</li>
    <li> I have always used Crest but they made my teeth so sensitive. The two days of pain wasn&#x27;t worth it.......for awhile. So I decided to give this a try. I am on day three and my husband notice! I haven&#x27;t had any teeth sensitivity. My results have been amazing. Every time I&#x27;ve tried to whiten before the days of hurting wasn&#x27;t worth it. I personal have never been able to do 3 days in a row. 3 times in one week. Thank You!!  You will be so happy with your results. It&#x27;ll make you feel and be more confident.</li>
    <li> works great! great price!</li>
    <li> I purchases these strips and the Crest 3D Luxe strips.  My daughter wanted the Crest ones and I didn&#x27;t want to pay or two because of the price so I bought these for myself.  These strips are just as good as the Crest strips and a lot cheaper.  I recommend these plus you get more for less.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great! Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> These are the real deal AND affordable!  They are very sticky, so no slipping.  Saw huge improvement in just a couple days, so much so that my husband had me order him some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these strips for a couple days and already notice a HUGE difference. These work better than any whitening strips I&#x27;ve used before. I recommend!</li>
    <li> The product came promptly and packaging etc was as expected. I like the convenience of using these strips. As described in the product description- I can continue doing everything with these strips on. I saw some other reviews about difficulty removing the strips- I had no trouble putting them on or removing them. After using for two days- I have had no trouble with teeth sensitivity etc.</li>
    <li> I have to come back in a few days and tell you if they worked but I wanted to advise people to only use them for 30-45 mins because I tried them for a full hour and it was like I had glue on my teeth and It was a mission to get the strip off, the residue came off easily but it was kinda gross.</li>
    <li> i have had these for about a week and they work good to me  .this coming from a person who drinks soda everyday and occassionally smokes. ive only givwn it four because im not done another week to go but good so far oh and the conplaints about how hard it is to get off .. its not that hard. all i do is wipe it of off with a wash cloth then swish water in my mouth</li>
    <li> I usually use the crest strips, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the money this time around and thought I would try something new.  The ratings confirmed that trying them would probably be worth it.  The most important thing to me is that they don&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive.  They are already sensitive, and the other products I have tried made them even worse; to the point that even the thought of different textures make me cringe.  These did not leave my teeth sensitive at all.  SO impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really liked that they had a minty flavor to them.  Other products I have tried tasted like chemicals/bleach.  These just had a fresh minty toothpaste taste to them.  Very pleased with this detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take just as much effort to take off as the other guys; nothing lost nothing gained.  I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> There are so many whitestrips out there that it can be overwhelming to decide which to use. I read all the reviews on this brand they truly lived up to my expectations. I&#x27;m on day 5 and my teeth are much whiter! Hands down would order again!</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly! My teeth look remarkably whiter even after only 2 days of using them. Love this brand and will absolutely continue to purchase through the company.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love these strips! They stick better and are way more effective than Crest - I will buy them again!</li>
    <li> It tastes nasty and sticky like glue....never seen anything like this.</li>
    <li> I rarely give 5 stars to anything.  But, these are so much better than Crest strips and Rembrant.  These actually stay in your teeth and did not irate my gums!  I Will definitely purchase these again!</li>
    <li> As others have noted, these are very sticky - much more so than Crest. They therefore stay on much better but are difficult to remove. Not so much that I won&#x27;t keep using them - they seem to work well for general whitening needs.</li>
    <li> they are pretty good! I am 38 and I felt like they made my teeth a little sensitive. i have used strips before and never had this problem, but havent used in a year and a half, so I am not sure if it is the brand or my teeth!</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied with this product; easy to use and results are immediate.  I am a coffee drinker and I was able to see results in 2 applications.  It is just as good, if not better than the national brands. I will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> LOVE these strips! These are a) affordable b) have not caused sensitivity issues even after leaving the strips on for up to 1.5 hours c) provide immediate results. They are a little sticky to remove. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get paid to try this, I just wanted an alternative to crest whitestrips and this got a lot of positive reviews. There is a crazy amount of glue on these strips which made it difficult to apply these onto my teeth since they were sticking to my fingertips instead. I also had to throw one package from the box away because while opening the little foil packet, one of the teeth strips rolled up and the glue would not allow me to unravel it for use. There is definitely a minty taste to the product which I appreciate and I have noticed my teeth getting whiter, but the application is a bitch. I would definitely suggest taking the strips off their plastic very carefully and take your time with it because they will roll up and be unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think someone complained about German instructions but everything on the box is written in English as well as the instructions on the foil packets. The only thing in German is the instructional page that says exactly what&#x27;s on the box and packets so you&#x27;re not missing out.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Does as promised. Had no problems using the strips. I left on one hour and saw improvement after 3 applications.</li>
    <li> Okay, I must say I am extremely surprised. I thought these wouldn&#x27;t be very effective for their price. Oh, was I wrong! I have to say that after the first use I didn&#x27;t notice any special difference. After the second application, I could see a clear difference in whiteness. My lower arch was very yellow when I started the treatment. Now, after the third application, I can already smile wide and show everybody how awesome my teeth look. There is still a long way to go to achieve the whiteness I dream of, but man, they work!!! My teeth had always been yellow. Now my smile is so much prettier. Looks healthier, too! I agree with others that these cause zero sensitivity. I could eat and drink right after that hour of having it on. I can&#x27;t wait to see further results. Highly recommended purchase!!!</li>
    <li> This product is okay.. I didn&#x27;t really see a difference with my teeth after using it.. Next time I will get crest; I shouldn&#x27;t have changed.  I will not buy this product in the future..</li>
    <li> This product has met expectations.  The strips are packaged well and stick to your teeth very well.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> These White Strips DO NOT WORK. Their Amazon REVIEWS ARE DISHONEST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a young student in my early twenties with slightly yellow teeth from moderate coffee and wine indulgence - aka a perfect candidate for successful at-home teeth whitening. Instead, these were my results: I used these strips for 14 days, two hours per day, and my teeth did NOT LIGHTEN A SINGLE SHADE. My teeth are the same color after the whole box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this kit because it was about $5-$10 cheaper than the leading Crest strips on Amazon and had incredible reviews. I am trying to be an optimistic person and, therefore, did not read the few non 5-star and 4-star reviews before making my purchase. Excellent deal I thought! After a week of no results and noticeable tooth sensitivity, I decided to look at the unfavorable/honest reviews on Amazon. Two things I found in my search:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This company has NO presence outside amazon. No other place that google could guide me to to find an objective review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The amazon reviews are DISHONEST. Apparently, this company refunds your money back entirely if you are willing to a) remove your negative review, but also b) post a positive review! Thus, not only are you not going to see any negative reviews, the positive reviews were bought by the company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: The reviews are untrustworthy. This product will probably not work - yes, your teeth will get slightly sensitive; no, they will not lighten at all. Please spend the extra $10 and buy the Crest White strips (if you don&#x27;t want to end up spending $50 like me - $20 on this fraud and $30 on Crest anyway).</li>
    <li> Will never use the name brand strips again!  I have sensitive teeth, I use a sensitivity toothpaste. These strips are great, I only experience very minor sensitivity (no wincing just very very minor for a little while the next day) and only when I leave it on for over an hour.  The first time I tried them I only did 45 mins, to see how I tolerated it, no sensitivity at all, next time I went for a full hour, next an hour and ten mins, next time will be an hr and twenty mins and I will work up to a full two hour if I can- but that is a long time to have these in your mouth. They def work my teeth are gradually getting brighter.  I don&#x27;t use them on consecutive days though, I let 1-2 days (usually two) go in between just to be on the safe side. I suggest that if you also have sensitive teeth you do what I do and just gradually increase how long you keep them on and def let a few days go in between treatments. They have a very nice minty tingle to them which I thought was a really nice touch. DO NOT BRUSH BEFORE USING THE STRIPS. BRUSH AFTER, and again if you have sensitivity, USE A SENSITIVITY TOOTHPASTE, especially after using these. Im very happy with these. The price is so good too, I think the name brand ones are way too expensive and they make my teeth alot more sensitive. Follow the instructions on the packaging- SO MANY PPL DO NOT DO THIS AND THEN BASH PRODUCTS, but how can a product be expected to preform if it isn&#x27;t being used properly????!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this teeth whitening for 3 days and am seeing NO results at all. Also the gel that I&#x27;m currently using has begun to get hard already and won&#x27;t come out of the tube! theo the tube is leaking..... (I keep the cap on tight) I feel no tooth sensitivity and see not even a little whitening results. my gums hurt however. I do it for an hour every day, with the light the first 15 minutes. How do I know if I got a bad batch? Very disappointed :(.</li>
    <li> My review wont be as extensive! All I will say is this product is phenomenal! I have tried them all! I have tried the Crest, Colgate and this product beats them all! After 1 treatment I noticed drastic difference! Please buy buy buy!</li>
    <li> Really liked them they worked super well!! Affordable price</li>
    <li> After seeing the positive reviews of this product, I&#x27;ve decided to give it a try. The result was more than satisfactory, my wife commented on how much whiter my teeth looks after using it for only 3 days, I will definitely buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I thought the reviews were a lie, but omg this is amazing and the price!!!! Its really great, I noticed a difference in one treatment be consistent people!</li>
    <li> I have been using the 3D White wasnt really happy and did some searching online and come across this product. Let me say this i was quite a bit unsure of getting this product, but let me tell you I am happy that I did I have used it Twice so far and im on day 3 I already can tell the difference, and it keeps my teeth feeling clean almost feels like glass.&lt;br /&gt;I have been leaving it on for two hours but you dont need to only between 30-60 minutes but im a huge coffee drinker and $600 for a teeth cleaning is a bit much of you ask me. So if your looking for some whitening strips I suggest you try these and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and well packaged. I&#x27;m a big fan of the whitestips and these are the best by far.  Less sensitivity and whiter teeth after just a couple uses.</li>
    <li> These work incredibly fast! Just started using them a couple days ago and I already notice a difference!</li>
    <li> Great product and price! I noticed a difference in whiteness after only two applications.</li>
    <li> These strips are the BEST!! I&#x27;ve used bleaching trays for years and I just dread it because I can&#x27;t talk, can&#x27;t drink water, just basically out of commission for the hour. But with these little babies that&#x27;s not the case! AND they work! I haven&#x27;t had them long but I&#x27;m already seeing results. Also, there&#x27;s no sensitivity and they stay put!! Great product. I&#x27;ll never go back to the trays.</li>
    <li> These strips work very well. I noticed my whiter teeth after the first use, and each day thereafter! Customer service was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend Onuge brand whitening strips.</li>
    <li> These whitestrips seem to work well as far as whitening my teeth.  I have used them for 4 days and can see results.  The strips are extremely hard to remove from your teeth after the hour time period has passed.  I have to wet them thoroughly to get them off (I had the same results when leaving the strips on for only 30 minutes).  The strips have a bad taste and leave a very sticky residue on your teeth that you have to brush off when you are done.  I would not buy these strips again.    **UPDATE**  After submitting this review, I received an email from the seller offering to refund my purchase price if I gave a better review.  Maybe that&#x27;s why there are so many 5 star reviews........</li>
    <li> Delivered very quickly and seems to already be working just a couple days in.</li>
    <li> Good product, you see results after the first hour&#x27;s use and i was really happy after the second use.  The only tiny issue is all the residue that&#x27;s left on your teeth after usage, so if you wanted to use it &#x27;on the go&#x27;, you couldn&#x27;t.  What I do is brush y teeth with just water and all of the residue turns into kind of a paste, just i just brush and gargle it out.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a big fan of these. I orchard because of all th positive reviews though I usually use crest white strips. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference like the crest strips, just a few of those and my teeth are shades lighter. I&#x27;m glad I tried but I will be going back to what works for me.</li>
    <li> so Far these seem to be working fine.  I&#x27;ll know in a week or so.  Maybe a good purchase.  If so, I will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Definitely see a difference, but only on the bottom half of my tooth on all of my teeth. It&#x27;s only whitening half of my tooth</li>
    <li> I have Amazon Prime so it came quickly. Already noticed a difference after one use and I did not experience sensitivity like I have with other products. I was worried about having to leave on my teeth for more that 15 minutes (because most whitening strips start to melt at that point) but I didn&#x27;t have that issue at all.</li>
    <li> I love  these! Especially love that they stick to my teeth. They stay put till you take them off. Great product! I will buy them again!</li>
    <li> Teeth are whiter and healthier looking. They worked great for my extremely sensitive teeth, and the price is right!</li>
    <li> I really like these, the Crest strips bothered my gums and these do not at all. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used twice so far, but they do stick very well and don&#x27;t slide around. My teeth do seem a bit brighter and I&#x27;m hopingvwith more use I will see a noticeable difference in whiteness. No sensitivity so far.</li>
    <li> I have used these whitestrips for four days and can already tell a difference.  As advertized, they don&#x27;t slip on the teeth.  They are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product for great price! They stick to your teeth and you can still talk and do what you need to do while they are on.  I have used them about 5 times now and I notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I have used the whitestrips probably 5 times now-2 times for one hour and 3 times for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was feeling a bit of sensitivity after the 4th application because I had been applying once a day for 4 consecutive days, so I took a few days off before the 5th application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty happy with the results-I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect since I hadn&#x27;t used whitestrips before and had nothing to compare to, but I would have to say my teeth are several shades lighter than they were when I started. My teeth are/were fairly yellow-I like coffee and don&#x27;t always remember to swish with water after I drink it, so it has taken its toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit wary when I started-I hoped that I wouldn&#x27;t run into sensitivity issues with my gums since I have receding gumlines in some areas, but I did not have any problems there. I did experience the white patches on my teeth after removing the strips--they do disappear pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that I can continue to lighten a bit more from where I am now-my goal is for someone to comment on my teeth without any prompting from me. I would definitely know I had arrived if that happened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> These strips have been great!  I have already noticed a difference after using them for 3 days for an hour each.  Easy to apply and remove.</li>
    <li> These white strips work great. Teeth get really white.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I&#x27;ve used so many different teeth whiteners in the past and this is the first one where I actually saw a difference. It&#x27;s easy to use and works in a short amount of time. Recommended.</li>
    <li> It sticks to your hand when you take it off the plastic and it&#x27;s not long enough to cover your teeth. I didn&#x27;t like that. It was discusting: I think whitestrips is not for me and I was about to throw up. I didn&#x27;t even wanted to spit for that whole hour when I did it was discusting, but I&#x27;m going to update later on after 2 weeks to see if it whiten my teeth...</li>
    <li> Great product that whitenes your teeth.  Easy to use and works like the higher priced products.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The item came very fast, and the product itself works wonders. With one use I noticed a significant change in my smile, and I have received many compliments. It is enamel safe and works just as well as any other white strip out there; yet, these are half the</li>
    <li> This product really surpassed my expectations! I had been using crest white strips and they were unreasonably expensive. I find that these white strips work just as well for half the cost. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I am EXTREMELY pleased with my purchase of Onuge Teeth Whitening Strips. I was reading about the Crest Whitening Strips, but after all the comments I read about how they made your teeth very sensitive, I quickly changed my mind. I have sensitive teeth anyway, so I didn&#x27;t want anything that was going to aggravate the problem. The first day I received my strips, I started my first treatment and was excited to see the results. This is day two and I am totally pleased with the results. They do not slip around, they are easy to put on, they do not have a nasty taste and REALLY do work. I will DEFINATELY be using this product from now on and will recommend this to my family and friends!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Onuge Lovely Smile whitestrips.  I noticed a difference in just two applications.  I love the way they stick to my teeth and don&#x27;t slip around like the other brands I have tried.  I highly recommend the Onuge Lovely Smile whitestrips and plan to purchase these as my only whitestrips.  So happy and I know you will be to! YAY for Onuge Lovely Smile!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working so far. Easy to use and sticks well.</li>
    <li> By far the best teeth whitening product you can buy. I work at a dentist and I know how expensive teeth whitening can be. A professional teeth whitening kit cost anywhere from $300-$500 in the office but I have to say this works the same if not better. I did get a zoom treatment back in 2014 but it was painful and did cause sensitivity in my teeth and the results did not last. So  I have looked for different alternatives and have bought countless things but nothing has compared to this. For the price and the results it does not got any better. Do not pay for colgate strips as they are over priced and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Stay on my teeth much better than crest strips have. Have noticed a difference after only one use!</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as Crest 3D. Also, the strips recommend use of 1-2hrs at a time but melt after about 50mins, leaving a nasty residue on teeth and a mess to take off</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I do see a difference in the color of my teeth! I love how well the strips stay in place! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but the strips adhered very well and my teeth are noticeably brighter.  I could talk without worrying about them coming off.  I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> These are super terrific whiteners.  They are like stickers, easy to use, easy to peel off after 30 minutes.  I went 6 shades lighter in 3 sessions.  Great price and delivery!</li>
    <li> Great product! It arrived within 2 days, as promised. I usually use Crest White Strips but those cause tooth sensitivity for me so I wanted to try something new &amp; these have the same results but they don&#x27;t cause any pain/discomfort! Highly recommend if you want to brighten your smile in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> very good. I&#x27;ve seen results and has no sensibility</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is so gaga over these strips.  First of all, you really need to leave them on for 2 hours at a time to make a difference.  And, I will admit, you see pretty good results if you do that.  But two hours is a lot to leave them on.  Second, when you peel them off the plastic, they roll up and you have to kind of untangle them.  Sometimes you can&#x27;t really untangle them.  I had to throw out a whole bottom strip because it rolled up too much, and i&#x27;ve had to cut off rolled up parts of top strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they&#x27;re pretty cheap, but you can usually find whitening strips on sale at your local drugstore.  As someone who whitens their teeth all the time, these were just kind of a hassle.</li>
    <li> Cannot comment on whitening abilities yet, but I can tell you that the quality of the actual strip is pretty poor. Just getting the strips off of the tab is a daunting task. More often than not I end up applying a damaged strip due to health flimsy each one is.</li>
    <li> Great product! I had previously used Crest Whitestrips which caused sore gums and were twice as expensive. These work so much better at a much lower cost!</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! Shipped quickly and I noticed results after the first day! I am on Day 6 of using this product and my teeth are a lot whiter and I  have not experienced any sensitivity to my teeth or gums.  I will buy this product again and I recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable way to whiten their teeth!</li>
    <li> Very good product and a lot simpler to use than expected</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my teeth after 3 uses. The &amp;#34;advanced no slip technology&amp;#34; is legit, which is good since you have to wear them for an hour. It does leave some serious residue on your teeth so I always had to have my toothbrush handy after I took them off but no big deal.</li>
    <li> These worked great! No slipping around the mouth, stayed on great. Didn&#x27;t irritate my sensative teeth and work just like the Crest advance seal.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate... this is the product for you -- I have tried several brands and types over the years with varying results.  The results included not even being able to continue use of a product due to pain or lack of results.  I have been able to use these strips, they stay in place and I can still talk and go about my business at home while using them.  My family can see the results and want to purchase additional product for themselves.  I have been able to continue the use for 5 days now without the discomfort that came with other brands -- and although I can&#x27;t imagine my smile will get brighter, I want to use the entire product to see if that is possible.  I would recommend this brand to anyone, especially anyone who is hesitating because of previous experiences with substandard products... this is not the case -- you will be very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product my daughter especially loved using it to whiten her teeth, I would recommend buying the product again and recommend buying it from this site because it provides a good value and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> These whitening strip are by far the best ones I&#x27;ve used. I noticed a difference on the first day! I highly recommend these. I&#x27;m so glad I came across these.</li>
    <li> Just like the Crest Whitestrips, what a great find.</li>
    <li> I loved these white strips, they were less expensive than others and did the same job.  Will definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, I recommend using them daily to get strong results. Overall very good:)</li>
