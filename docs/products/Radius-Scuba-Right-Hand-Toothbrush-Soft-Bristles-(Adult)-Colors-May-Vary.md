      <li>I love the size of toothbrush head -</li>
      <li>&quot; that&#x27;s really more of a two pack...</li>

      <li>They&#x27;re the best, hands down.</li>
      <li>I think Amazon should look into who filled the order.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for gum stimulation, plus it&#x27;s a massive brush for your teeth.</li>
      <li>Hand grip is quite comfortable.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re comfortable to my hand</li>
      <li>Thank you for making it available online.</li>
      <li>Sturdy and comfortable toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it has a very large head.</li>
      <li>It just might not be the perfect fit for everyone, and it is more expensive and more wasteful.</li>
      <li>Its handle is not quite as ergonomic as the Scuba and the head isn&#x27;t so large, but it is still larger than most toothbrushes and joy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with a small mouth. :D</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it works better as the larger head means more cleaning area!  </li>
      <li>This brush get&#x27;s into every tooth and cranny, and after using it your mouth feels so clean.</li>
      <li>Your mouth feels so clean after using this.  </li>
      <li>The bristles clean your pearly whites with conviction.  </li>
      <li>My mouth feels super clean after brushing my teeth with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate buy this toothbrush you will Love it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>It even makes you feeling fresh and clean longer.  </li>
      <li>It is now my favorite too by far!</li>
      <li>I guess when I go for my cleaning in December, I&#x27;ll know whether it is REALLY worth the $4.00...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Worth a try, but when this one wears out, I doubt I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
      <li>Better than our sonicare brushes by far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The handle is comfortable, the head may look big, but it&#x27;s still super easy to use.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is pretty cool and very unusual looking.  </li>
      <li>But I recommend that you just go for the brush/case set right off the bat.</li>
      <li>I know the handles are made specifically for right or left-handed brushing, and I guess are there to make it easier ergonomically speaking to brush well.  </li>
      <li>It makes a very noticeable difference in the effectiveness of brushing, as well as how clean your teeth feel afterward.</li>
      <li>It comes in either right or left hand styles to insure you get the best possible control over the brush action.</li>
      <li>Match them with some high quality toothpaste from a real health store (such as a product from JASON) and you will have some seriously good oral hygeine going on.</li>
      <li>The bottom portion of the handle feel modeled for my palm, the thumb rest in just the right spot and with ridges for traction, and the opposite side of the thumb rest is dimpled to provide even better grip for your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handle is very ergonomic and the bristles are just the right stiffness - right around a medium or so, which is my preference.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Radius toothbrush is so wonderful. My dentist has told me that my gums are so pink because of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a six-foot tall guy and would say I&#x27;m slightly above average in size. I&#x27;ve got a big mouth too (just ask my wife). You&#x27;d think that the Radius Scuba brush would be a perfect fit for me. When it comes to fitting in my hand the yes, it&#x27;s perfect. The design of the handle maximizes grip and precision like no other toothbrush out there. It comes in either right or left hand styles to insure you get the best possible control over the brush action. The bottom portion of the handle feel modeled for my palm, the thumb rest in just the right spot and with ridges for traction, and the opposite side of the thumb rest is dimpled to provide even better grip for your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there is the oversized brush head. Many people love it, I know I wanted to. I&#x27;ll admit that it is better than using most standard toothbrushes with its extra coverage and soft bristles. It is also terrific for brushing your tongue. A smaller bristled brush takes quite a few strokes to clean the tongue while Scuba only takes a few swipes. My only complaint is that I found it too large. When brushing it feels uncomfortably bulky. After I finish, it feels like I&#x27;ve missed spots at the very back corners of my mouth. Factor in its high cost and need to replace the whole brush when the bristles wear out, and suddenly I become less enamored with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the perfect toothbrush in its slightly more compact sibling, the [[ASIN:B001COV9A8 Radius Source]]. It costs less than the Scuba, has replaceable heads, and comes with two of them so it&#x27;s like getting two brushes for the same lower price. When finished, I can dispose of the head and be glad that there is that much less waste going into a landfill somewhere. Its handle is not quite as ergonomic as the Scuba and the head isn&#x27;t so large, but it is still larger than most toothbrushes and joy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying the Radius Scuba isn&#x27;t a great toothbrush. I doubt it would have such a loyal following if it weren&#x27;t. It just might not be the perfect fit for everyone, and it is more expensive and more wasteful. In the end, you have to figure out what works best for you, but for me, it isn&#x27;t the Radius Scuba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Korterfect fit for everyone, and it is more expensive and more wasteful. In the end, you have to figure out what works best for you, but for me, it isn&#x27;t the Radius Scuba.     ~ Kort</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of things from Amazon that I am happy with. My bathroom sink has a saftey razor, 100 blades, a boar&#x27;s bristle brush and stand and Mr. Taylors of Old Bond Street shaving soap And now a BIG...no HUGE PINK toothbrush. These toothbrushes are very large nearly triple the standard size.     There is no way for me to respond to Amazon. No customer service to rectify. Near the product description it says colors may vary. I am very unhappy and very unsatisfied. Whoever serviced this order could have looked. Should have looked at my name, my past purchases. I bought a Marine Corps Zippo lighter.    I did write a comment to shipping but no surprise. No response. :-(      PS-Now I will have to send back the total order to express my dissatisfaction.  I think Amazon should look into who filled the order.</li>
    <li> I had a friend who used to be a product reviewer and he gave me my first Radius Toothbrush when they first came out.  It improved the health of my mouth way back then and I have kept using them ever since.</li>
    <li> Wanted a great performance toothbrush without an electric toothbrush price.  Radius!!!!  After years of not visiting a dentist, expected the worst when I finally saw one.  Decent report...owe it to the Radius.  Bought 6, giving to friends to try.  I&#x27;m sold for good!</li>
    <li> I began using the Radius Tooth Brush in 1993 and have continued to purchase them ever since. The main advantage of these brushes is the  ease of up and down brushing due to the angle of the brush. The brushes are very sturdy and allow thorough cleansing of teeth.</li>
    <li> While the size may look intimidating is very ergonomic in the mouth. I think it also kind of fun that the colors of the base and the bristles change regularly and you never know what you might get. I resisted for a long time as my partner from England happily brushed with this. Don&#x27;t wait like me, take the plunge today!</li>
    <li> This Radius Scuba Tootbrush is the best toothbrush I ever used. I once seen it on TV and it caught my interest, so I went on Amazon and found it. I thought I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;m sooooooo glad I did. I will NEVER use the traditional Toothbrush again. This brush get&#x27;s into every tooth and cranny, and after using it your mouth feels so clean. Don&#x27;t hesitate buy this toothbrush you will Love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> This was a great find! I had owned one of these toothbrushes many years ago, but could no longer  find it at any store. I wish that I could choose the color myself. I was sent two yellow brushes  and that makes it difficult to distinguish which is mine and which belongs to my wife.</li>
    <li> Since I started using these toothbrushes, I have not had any problems.  You cannot go wrong with the built in flex you really can&#x27;t push too hard.  The bristles clean your pearly whites with conviction.  Match them with some high quality toothpaste from a real health store (such as a product from JASON) and you will have some seriously good oral hygeine going on.</li>
    <li> My sister had this toothbrush and i noticed it one day while visiting her house.  She told me it was her favorite toothbrush she had ever owned and gave me one as a gift. It is now my favorite too by far! Whenever I went back to a standard toothbrush after using this, my teeth never felt clean.  With this toothbrush my teeth feel more clean and feel cleaner longer than with other toothbrushes.  I am hooked!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical at first.  The price is high for a non-electric toothbrush.  When I got it, I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would fit in my mouth!  That&#x27;s the genius of it though.  You can&#x27;t miss spots with this toothbrush.  It covers every surface of your mouth while you do the bare minimum of \\&quot;work\\&quot;.  I guess when I go for my cleaning in December, I&#x27;ll know whether it is REALLY worth the $4.00...but I do like the way my teeth feel and will probably buy a new one in NINE months! Plus, the company seems to be a \\&quot;responsible\\&quot; company, so that makes me feel that my money is being well spent.</li>
    <li> If you want the best toothbrush in the world, buy a sonicare.  If you want the best looking toothbrush in the world, Buy A Radius!</li>
    <li> I have used the RADIUS toothbrush for years now and highly recommend. It has a large luxurious feel. It is a unique product and whoever designed it should be very proud.</li>
    <li> Head of toothbrush is so large it&#x27;s impossible to maneuver in mouth.  Equivalent to clown shoes!  Handle very short too.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is pretty cool and very unusual looking.  The handle is very ergonomic and the bristles are just the right stiffness - right around a medium or so, which is my preference.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the head is so big that I feel like I have a difficult time reaching the backs for my molars.  I have not done any empirical testing, obviously, but this toothbrush does not feel like it cleans quite as well as a regular, smaller headed toothbrush, on the back teeth. Otherwise, it works better as the larger head means more cleaning area!  Overall, a decent toothbrush.  I just wish it had a narrower tip or something so it was easier to get at those hard-to-reach places.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with a small mouth. :D</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this toothbrush. I bought it at whole foods. I have been using it for about two months now. I was neem toothpaste with it. Between the two, my teeth have never felt this clean!</li>
    <li> Someone bought my husband a Radius toothbrush several years ago as a present and he has not used another kind since.  He loves how big it is.  He says that his teeth feel cleaner because it covers more area.  He is a hard brusher so it is great that they come in soft.  I have also used them, but I am left handed and they were hard to find.  I might start using them again since now I can just buy them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Have used this style for more than 25 years now. Obviously I like it and chose to use no other.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the radius brushes for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re here for the convince of it all, but I&#x27;d buy them just the same. My dentist compliments my teeth which to me lis a review enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable, the head may look big, but it&#x27;s still super easy to use. I love it because I feel the bristles getting more than just one part of my tooth at a time. It&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t bother even my sensitive gums! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and comfortable toothbrushes. They clean your teeth better than an electric toothbrush!!! Love them!!! I use them every day !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest.  I received my first Radius toothbrush as a joke gift.  This thing looks enormous if you&#x27;ve never used one before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I will never buy a normal toothbrush again.  Your mouth feels so clean after using this.  All those bristles really get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pair it with Eco-Dent toothpowder and its a match made in dazzling smile heaven.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. While others think it&#x27;s too big I find it the perfect size, it cleans my teeth thoroughly. I&#x27;ve used this type of toothbrush for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed this toothbrush until I finally ordered one. It&#x27;s a shame that&#x27;s the only way to get one. It&#x27;s great for gum stimulation, plus it&#x27;s a massive brush for your teeth. I was introduce to them about 15 years ago, &amp; always go back to them. Trust me, whenever you get used to one, there&#x27;s no going back to those skinny little toothbrushes. They&#x27;re just simply awesome.</li>
    <li> I love how the head of the toothbrush covers so many teeth at once...it&#x27;s really like brushing your whole mouth.  I know the handles are made specifically for right or left-handed brushing, and I guess are there to make it easier ergonomically speaking to brush well.  I guess it&#x27;s because of the way I personally brush my teeth, twirling the handle around in my hand to get the back teeth, etc., that this handle gets very awkward.  Worth a try, but when this one wears out, I doubt I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
    <li> I always thought to myself if only the toothbrushes were big it would take a lot less time and I would feel I missed no spots. This was the case with Scuba, but this toothbrush isn&#x27;t without it&#x27;s problem. The bristle are too long, some of my toothpaste was caught deep in the bristles after its first use and I had to keep rinsing it until I got them all. The handle tries to be ergonomic but just looks childish and feels weird. Finally the bristle are very soft, too soft. I had to really put some pressure down to feel like I was actually brushing away the plaque rather than just gently massaging it. This led to my gums bleeding, so big brushes are a catch 22. I will use this for the 9 months it said it should last and switch to something else.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush ever. Sturdy and holds up better then regular toothbrushes. I would definitely recommend this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to a tiny, ordinary toothbrush. I brush my teeth like 5 times a day with this thing! (You may think that&#x27;s weird until you try it - it&#x27;s hard to go back to a not-very-fresh mouth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels super-fresh after brushing. I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone in my family, all of whom say, &amp;#34;No, it&#x27;s weird and big!&amp;#34; Oh well. Such little faith.</li>
    <li> These clean so well, I literally cannot live without it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my cousin and he raves about it.  He said this brush is why his gums are healthy.</li>
    <li> Been using it for over 15 years and never had a cavity since.  Cleans gum and teeth perfect.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews...BEST TOOTHBRUSH EVER. Better than our sonicare brushes by far. It&#x27;s worth every penny. They sell them as a \\&quot;four-pack\\&quot; that&#x27;s really more of a two pack... two toothbrushes and two cases. I bought the single first as a test run. But I recommend that you just go for the brush/case set right off the bat. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not loving this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love the size of toothbrush head - the bristles are enough to ensure that all your teeth areas are brushed thoroughly and quickly. Hand grip is quite comfortable. Also with bristles being of medium softness - it neither wears out too fast, nor hurts your gums.</li>
    <li> Easy toothbrush to use at any angle. I have been using this brush for a couple years now and won&#x27;t go back to regular toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I love the big head toothbrush. My mouth feels super clean after brushing my teeth with this toothbrush. I went on vacation and forgot my Radius toothbrush and had to use a regular sized tooth brush I felt like I was using a child&#x27;s toothbrush. This is a great buy and an awesome experience ... BUY ONE! I absolutely recommended it.</li>
    <li> Not kidding or exaggerating.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend for a fancy electric this is the way to go.  They cost more than other manuals toothbrushes but last longer and it is like a completely different brushing experience.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> love these ordered 12 and will order again</li>
    <li> I love how it massages my gums an makes them better since I have gum disease. My gums bled the first week and I did not give up no matter the bleeding the discomfort. It toughened my gums and destist said keep it up!</li>
    <li> I really love these tooth brushes!  Once you try one of these with the big bristle head you won&#x27;t want to go back to the regular size tooth brush.  I think they would make awesome stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> love it cant find in stores and it just works so well for me its like a day at the spa for my gums</li>
    <li> Love using this tooth brush. Used a radius brand before and haven&#x27;t been able to go back to any other brand since then.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it has a very large head. Great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Pass these up.  I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for yrs.  From this particular vendor what I rec&#x27;d was a soft handle toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t even come close to the Radius quality that I have had for yrs.  Had to send them back - this had to be a knockoff.</li>
    <li> I started using these toothbrushes a decade ago and I can never go back to an ordinary one again. They&#x27;re comfortable to my hand (I have neuropathy) and angled perfectly to get anywhere in my mouth. They&#x27;re durable, clean easily and the bristles have never fallen out (when I retire them they become housecleaning supplies and every one of them is still in use, with only the the oldest starting to get bent bristles now). I&#x27;ll never ever buy another thin nasty toothbrush again. Very very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Radius toothbrushes! I started using in college and will never use another brand again in my life. They&#x27;re the best, hands down. I recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> like it, covers a wider area than regular toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I have used this kind of toothbrush for many years. I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in stores, so was very glad to find it on Amazon. They seem a little odd to use when you first try it, but once you have, you can&#x27;t go back to ordinary toothbrushes. They are comfortable to hold in your hand; they cover more area in your mouth; they last a long time. What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this toothbrush for about 10 years, however in the last two purchases I have noticed that the quality is going down. I went out and bought myself a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> So yes, this toothbrush is oddly shapen and has a very big head. The shape wasn&#x27;t such a big deal for me- it works fine, takes a minimal amount of time getting used to the handle not being straight, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any big advantage compared to a regular brush handle. The bristle part, however, is phenomenal. It&#x27;s much bigger than you&#x27;re used to, and will seem large at first. There are more bristles, and the size makes it so you can&#x27;t help but brush your gums at the same time as your teeth. After using the Radius toothbrush and going back to a regular one a few weeks later when I was traveling, the regular toothbrush seemed comically small- like it was designed for infants or something. The bristles (of a regular brush) don&#x27;t even brush your whole teeth, let alone your gums. The difference between brushing with your finger and brushing with a regular toothbrush, is a similar difference to what you will see going from a regular toothbrush to the Radius. It really is that good, and I won&#x27;t be using a regular toothbrush as long as this place stays in business. It makes a very noticeable difference in the effectiveness of brushing, as well as how clean your teeth feel afterward. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush massages your gums while cleaning your teeth.  It even makes you feeling fresh and clean longer.  Thank you for making it available online.</li>
    <li> My teeth seem to get much cleaner much quicker.  Very comfortable bristles make my gums feel like they&#x27;ve had a massage.</li>
    <li> Love it took years to find this one</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush ever made</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t bother me with this stuff  ........... Bezos I&#x27;m not your employee, this is totally nuts and the last time i will ever bother</li>
    <li> This thing is goofy.  Just get a sonicare.</li>
    <li> Really love the product and really great price at that.... will be looking forward to plenty more purchases like this in the future.</li>
    <li> It is good for gums that may be sensitive to regular tooth brushes but doesn&#x27;t get the teeth as clean as the regular radius tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Radius tooth brushes are the best.  It takes a week or two to get used to the bigger head but once you do going back to the little skinny toothbrush is impossible.</li>
    <li> Great soft brush. Cleans my teeth thoroughly in half the time of ordinary toothbrushes. I love it!  :oD</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for the past few years, and I can say that I&#x27;ve never been more loyal to any other product. There isn&#x27;t any comparison for this product out there, so I&#x27;d recommend trying it out to see if it&#x27;s for you. I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
