      <li>I received these yesterday and was very happy with the quality of the product.  </li>
      <li>&quot; I find them to be a very good buy.</li>
      <li>I loved that I could just pop these insoles into my slippers without trimming!  </li>
      <li>These are great for winter.</li>
      <li>Best of all the clogs are now warm and toasty.  </li>
      <li>An all around great buy.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>these fit perfect in my ugg boots</li>
      <li>The size was right, perfect to replace the worn soles of my Ugg slippers.</li>
      <li>They are very warm, and thicker than the original Merrell shearling insoles!  </li>
      <li>The quality is excellent, the right cushy thickness for a comfortable fit!</li>
      <li>Warm and wooly is the way to go.</li>
      <li>These fit in so many of my boots!</li>
      <li>after 2 winters they are 2/3 hairless, mostly where the most pressure from my feet are.</li>
      <li>LOVE these...</li>
      <li>Fabulous!</li>
      <li>I love them and I will proably order more for all of my boots.  </li>
      <li>I was lucky to find these great sheepskin liners in just the right size.</li>
      <li>I ordered these to add a little warm and squish to my winter boots, they turned out perfect.</li>
      <li>my boots are as good as new again :)</li>
      <li>They were very quick to reply and understanding of the issues.</li>
      <li>Keep my feet soft and warm!</li>
      <li>Purchased to put in large sized tennis shoes for my son to keep feet warm.  </li>
      <li>The length is accurate though</li>
      <li>/&gt;that is fit the shoe.</li>
      <li>but overall I am happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>, they were comfy, soft and since i always went barefoot in my shoes which probily arnt a good idea with these.</li>
      <li>Do not go out and buy a new pair of shearling clogs to keep your feet warm, get these to extend the life of your original shearling clogs, or &amp;#34; ice-shoes&amp;#34; as they are also called, much more economical too.</li>
      <li>That said, they fit perfectly, are accurate to size and the price is right, but they do wear down fairly fast.</li>
      <li>Real sheepskin, clean, soft and warm.  </li>
      <li>Cozy, comfortable &amp; warm.</li>
      <li>SOooooooo Comfy...WILL buy more in the future!  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery, too!</li>
      <li>you smell something funny?</li>
      <li>will recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;it is comfortable and soft, very warm.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The insole replacements are THICK ang genuine shearling, not the  man-made kind.</li>
      <li>I do not think these are real sheep skins.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit in my boots that are 1/2 a size too big (a 7.5).</li>
      <li>I got them to fit a pair of Sorel slippers because Sorel didn&#x27;t seem to think that actually MAKING replacement insoles for their slippers</li>
      <li>The real reason for the 5 stars was the customer service.</li>
      <li>Warm but sizes run small.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>They are warm, comfortable and not so thick as to make my shoes feel too tight.</li>
      <li>I have wide feet and the shoes I purchased them to use in are much wider than the inserts.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is the fur is long and shaggy, not short pile and wooly like most sheepskin.  </li>
      <li>After 3 days of use in dry weather, there was a funny smell like muddy &amp; aged damp cloth coming out the insoles.</li>
      <li>They were just not warm enough or even comfortable enough for me.  </li>
      <li>Soft, plush and comfy, but they don&#x27;t last too long.</li>
      <li>Like dead fish?&amp;#34;  We searched and realized the smell was from these insoles inside my 2 week old new boots.  </li>

    <li> Fabulous! These fit in so many of my boots!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick and hurts my feet. It doesn&#x27;t fit in my boots that are 1/2 a size too big (a 7.5).</li>
    <li> Purchased to put in large sized tennis shoes for my son to keep feet warm.  Arrived timely, was as described.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to add a little warm and squish to my winter boots, they turned out perfect. That wasn&#x27;t a surprise, its sorta hard to mess these up. The real reason for the 5 stars was the customer service. I moved during the shipment time and ended up missing the delivery twice! They worked with me via email and I finally received them. They were very quick to reply and understanding of the issues.</li>
    <li> I like this item,&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;it is comfortable and soft, very warm.&lt;br /&gt;that is fit the shoe.</li>
    <li> Warm but sizes run small. Wish i ordered a larger size. The slip on my shoes cause a little to short</li>
    <li> Soft, plush and comfy, but they don&#x27;t last too long. I got them to fit a pair of Sorel slippers because Sorel didn&#x27;t seem to think that actually MAKING replacement insoles for their slippers was a priority. That said, they fit perfectly, are accurate to size and the price is right, but they do wear down fairly fast. I bought them back in March and am now having to replace them in July.</li>
    <li> I purchased  these insoles  for a pair of Merrell  shearling clogs I have had for 5 years. The insole replacements are THICK ang genuine shearling, not the  man-made kind. They are very warm, and thicker than the original Merrell shearling insoles!  Do not go out and buy a new pair of shearling clogs to keep your feet warm, get these to extend the life of your original shearling clogs, or &amp;#34; ice-shoes&amp;#34; as they are also called, much more economical too.</li>
    <li> I received these yesterday and was very happy with the quality of the product.  The only complaint I have is the inserts are very narrow.  I have wide feet and the shoes I purchased them to use in are much wider than the inserts.  The length is accurate though and so I&#x27;m going to keep them.  They are sewn together so it would be impossible to cut them to size if the length wasn&#x27;t right.  They are warm, comfortable and not so thick as to make my shoes feel too tight. For a product that is advertised as \\&quot;Defective\\&quot; I find them to be a very good buy.</li>
    <li> I was lucky to find these great sheepskin liners in just the right size. I can use a size 7 or 8. The quality is excellent, the right cushy thickness for a comfortable fit! Fast delivery, too! Cozy, comfortable &amp; warm. An all around great buy. Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Real sheepskin, clean, soft and warm.  The size was right, perfect to replace the worn soles of my Ugg slippers.</li>
    <li> These are great for winter. Keep my feet soft and warm! You just have to be really particular in cutting it to fit the size of your shoe. I have really small feet, so had to trim them quite a bit. The sewing became just a tiny bit loose after cutting. All in all, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> After 3 days of use in dry weather, there was a funny smell like muddy &amp; aged damp cloth coming out the insoles. It didn&#x27;t happen to my UGG boot.  I do not think these are real sheep skins.  Now I understand why seller included &amp;#34;real sheepskin&amp;#34; in item description.  Here is the sad story: I took off my boots to let my feet rest in the office.  A few minutes later, my co-workers asked, &amp;#34;Do you smell something funny? Like dead fish?&amp;#34;  We searched and realized the smell was from these insoles inside my 2 week old new boots.  How embarrassing.  Vendor is not allowing return because ... These are health and personal products.  Oh, this is the trick vendor is using to proven return even the product failed.  Learned my lesson.  I will never buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I just received these insoles and they are thick and plush.  I love them and I will proably order more for all of my boots.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I loved that I could just pop these insoles into my slippers without trimming!  Not as thick as one of the name-brands, but very acceptable!</li>
    <li> Warm and wooly is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I like these shoe liners.  I put them in a pair of leather lined clogs that I bought for winter wear.  They were just not warm enough or even comfortable enough for me.  These liners did the trick.  The clogs were a tiny bit too loose and the liners took up just enough space to make the shoe hug my foot.  Best of all the clogs are now warm and toasty.  I would have ordered two pairs but did not want to pay double shipping.  My only complaint is the fur is long and shaggy, not short pile and wooly like most sheepskin.  I cannot begin to say how they will wear but overall I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> these fit perfect in my ugg boots, they were comfy, soft and since i always went barefoot in my shoes which probily arnt a good idea with these. after 2 winters they are 2/3 hairless, mostly where the most pressure from my feet are. so i have to wear socks unless my feet feel weird on the hairless parts and its falling apart too so if i do try these insoles again im wearing socks and mabey they will last longer</li>
    <li> my boots are as good as new again :)</li>
    <li> I have such tender feet, Sheepskin is the only thing that helps.  These started out a little to fluffy, but after walking on them for a week they were just right.</li>
    <li> LOVE these...I wear these in all my boots during the winter ! SOooooooo Comfy...WILL buy more in the future!  Thank You Amazon!!</li>
