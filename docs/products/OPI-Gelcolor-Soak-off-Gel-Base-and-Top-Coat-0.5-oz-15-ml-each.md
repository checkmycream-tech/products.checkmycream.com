      <li>Other reviewers convinced me that this is the best brand, and I have been quite pleased.</li>
      <li>Works great with my eQualle Professional LED Nail Lamp Dryer 36w with Timer.</li>
      <li>so when the polish came off it wouldn&#x27;t be so easy to notice.  </li>
      <li>easy to use.  </li>
      <li>takes time to apply and dry but the durability is incredible</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them with a non-OPI colour yet, but I imagine it would still be fine.</li>
      <li>OPI gel color has beautiful colors, more to my liking than other gel brands.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge difference in terms of durability and the finish is shinier with these products.</li>

      <li>Exactly what I wanted and shipped very quickly!</li>
      <li>Excellent base and top coat for gel color services...love it!!!</li>
      <li>noticed slightly better performance with OPI.&lt;br /&gt;Polish stays on longer (getting 3 weeks consistently).</li>
      <li>OPI is my favorite, first time ive tried it</li>
      <li>Worth the effort!</li>
      <li>Work great but remember this is only the top and bottom clear coats</li>
      <li>This pair is essential for doing a good Gelcolor manicure</li>
      <li>Works easily and fast!</li>
      <li>Using top coat as the color makes the nails look clean and clear, looks like you are not wearing nail polish, except for the shine.</li>
      <li>I always loved OPI and wish the general public had an many choices in gel as salons do.</li>
      <li>This gel polish will probably be the only kind I ever buy again.</li>
      <li>thin coat works best for me.</li>
      <li>I love it over my natural nails</li>
      <li>Not really thick, so easy to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love OPI!!!! What else can I say!!!!! Will always purchase from Amazom....fast shipping....</li>
    <li> I like these and wear these alone most of the time.  My nails look super shiny, clean and professional.  The polish lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.  I got get nail polish and a UV nail dryer so I could do gel manicures at home.  This goes on easy--same bottle as the regular polish and has never bubbled or streaked. It works will with other gel nail polishes as well as it does with OPI color gel. You definitely have to swab your nails with rubbing alcohol after the last coat as other reviewers have noted.  It takes the stickiness away and leaves the nails shinny.  if you get hairspray or anything else tacky on your nails, just run a cotton ball of rubbing alcohol across your nails and they will look brand new again.  My manicures have lasted anywhere form 7-15 days with this polish!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Works with LED or UV light</li>
    <li> I am now in love with gel nails.  Thanks OPI!</li>
    <li> No very good products. the take so long long to dry.</li>
    <li> These products do precisly that which is necessary. No complaints, smoove application.</li>
    <li> Everytime I used this product it always shriveled up my design onced it cured. I have not had one good cure since I bought it. It is long lasting that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Worked just like I&#x27;ve seen it work in a salon. Apply thin layers. I cured the base coat for 90 sec. Top coat 120 sec. Prob too long, but wanted to make certain it was cured long enough!</li>
    <li> The base coat is great but the top coat is so runny I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> OPI is the best brand in my opinion. Very easy to use but have to be careful not to brush on too thick of a layer. I use the top coat 3 times so nails are clear gel color instead of using a color. Using top coat as the color makes the nails look clean and clear, looks like you are not wearing nail polish, except for the shine.</li>
    <li> Not really thick, so easy to use.</li>
    <li> The only gel polish I have used at home that will not peel on me eventually. VERY happy about this purchase! Will only be buying OPI gel color in the future.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best I&#x27;ve used.  Good protection for your manicure.</li>
    <li> Very good base and top coat no chipping</li>
    <li> SO MUCH BETTER THAN CND!!  I have been using CND gel base and top coats with my gel polish LED light and they would peel off after one-three days.  This lasts 1-2 weeks - like it should!  It never bubbles like the CND gel would, and it has a beautiful smooth shine.  I wish I had bought this sooner.  On top of all of that, it is double the size of the CND.  Definitely get this for at home gel nails - it is great.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast &amp; fresh😁</li>
    <li> These are great. I am done trying the off brands that are mediocre. Finally just took the plunge and bought the real deal. Cures great without the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; cure some generic brands have. I like it better than gelish brand because opi brushes r better and their base is not goopy like gelish.</li>
    <li> Base coat goes on so smooth and dries so fast and the top coat has an amazing shine to it. It isEasy to apply way better then the gelish brand which tore my skin</li>
    <li> Searched around for ones that didn&#x27;t just peel off and these ones worked amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought it so that I can do gel manicures at home. It&#x27;s great. I have encountered no problems. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this set of gel base and top coats.  OPI products in general seem to last longer without chipping and the gel line is no exception.  The top coat keeps my nails shiny and makes my nails feel thicker so they are less prone to breaking.  The base coat does a great job of adhering color and making it last, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect my nails from staining.</li>
    <li> OPI is my favorite, first time ive tried it i have a very had hard time with gel staying on my nails for more than 3 days without lifting up So far i havent had issues iwth OPI its my favorite. And i do use OPI Bondaid though</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t skip these two steps if you want a salon-quality manicure. Worth the effort!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d always used Gelish prior to buying these, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back.  These soak off beautifully (buff top coat, acetone/cotton ball/tin foil combo, 8 minutes) and don&#x27;t hurt my nails at all.  They&#x27;re reasonably priced, and cure harder than any of the Gelish I&#x27;ve used before.  Love these!</li>
    <li> The base coat is a little  watery, compared to others I have used. However, OPI is the gel system I have had the best luck with doing nails on my own!</li>
    <li> I got a gel kit for Christmas, which had the OPI line of products. I bought some other brand of polishes and found that the OPI base and top coat made them last just like the OPI polish. Doesn&#x27;t chip until I get real close to needing to change the polish and for the sake of fairness, I took off acyrlic nails and there is a lot of damage to grow out. Sometimes the chipping and breakage is due to the poor quality of the nail. I found that as they are growing out, I have much less of this. I am really rough on nails, so this stuff is a miracle worker for someone like me. Do yourself a favor and get the best and you&#x27;ll get the best results.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the results.  A thinner application lasts longer and looks much better than putting on a thick layer.</li>
    <li> I used Shellac for a year and now switched to OPI.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed slightly better performance with OPI.&lt;br /&gt;Polish stays on longer (getting 3 weeks consistently). Also, the top coat seems to hold the nail stickers better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I peal off the polish (don&#x27;t soak it in acetone) and that works better with OPI then with Shellac (in case you want to try).</li>
    <li> Yess! Fast arrival and I love this brand. I had to re-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: I use OPI gel base and top with cheaper gel colors and they last long.</li>
    <li> I used Gelish products for a year until I decided to try Opi Gelcolor. It&#x27;s a huge difference in terms of durability and the finish is shinier with these products.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Works just like I wanted it too so I could do my own nails and stop paying $20-35 each time I wanted to change color or had a chip or my nails grew.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using SensatioNail home system for 6 months now and decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to OPI.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.  The first time I used it I had 3 nails that lifted completely on day 3 and 2 others that had huge chips.  I&#x27;d never had that happen before.  I assumed I&#x27;d done something incorrectly so I soaked off all the polish and gave my nails about a week to rest between applications.  The second time around I had only slightly better results - four nails lost all the polish.  Then I decided to not add any color so when the polish came off it wouldn&#x27;t be so easy to notice.  Sort of defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> These products are all counterfeit. They do not last and immediately peel up after just a day! I purchased a whole new set of OPI polishes through OPI and sure enough those lasted for three weeks!!! DO NOT BUY THESE!!</li>
    <li> I love doing my own shallac. It&#x27;s way cheaper and stays on so well! I put in around $125 total with the light and colors, base and too coats, uv gloves, removers, etc. But with the money I&#x27;m saving at the salon ($40 a time), I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Opi always does the trick.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about the base coat, it is what it is. The top coat is very nice gives your nails and high gloss look. I&#x27;ve had it on for over a week no problems. I did make sure I had no oil on my nails before applying the base, I used rubbing alcohol to wipe them before hand.</li>
    <li> Just like at the nail salon, it seems expensive to buy at first but its worth it in the long term as compared to getting nails done every two weeks.</li>
    <li> It is so nice to be able to do my own nails on my own time.  This product is awesome.</li>
    <li> i love this product.  lasts long and strong.  can be used with my Sensationail uv lamp - I cure a little longer just to be on the safe side - 2 -3 minutes instead of 1 minute.</li>
    <li> This product is good, but didn&#x27;t say anything about having to use a dryer.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Love this set. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Both work great; but they do go on a little thick so take longer to cure than average polish.</li>
    <li> Works easily and fast!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and no clumps in bottle</li>
    <li> After a couple years of having gel polish done at professional salons, I finally got an at-home kit from Sensationail. I&#x27;d never had a problem removing my OPI gel polish manicures at home (buff the top of the gel polish with a rough emery board, put on a cotton ball damp with acetone and then wrap with a piece of foil; remove after 8-10 minutes and the whole thing has entirely flaked off), but I had to scratch off the Sensationail stuff even after 30 minutes of acetone - it took ages and damaged my nail beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPI&#x27;s base and top coat are the best - long-lasting, goes on easily, really shiny finish, and removes without damaging your nails. It works just fine with a drugstore brand LED lamp (same curing times as the lamp recommends). I haven&#x27;t tried them with a non-OPI colour yet, but I imagine it would still be fine.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Everything was perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought a professional dryer but this product takes a long long time to get it dry. Might be easier to just go to the salon to have it done</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of top and base coats and this is the BEST. I use it with the cheap Sensationail light and have used with with Red Carpet Manicure Colors and Senstionail colors. This stuff sets consistently and stays chip free for usually about two weeks (with dish washing, peeling of stickers, etc and all sorts of rough hand work). I just set it for 30 seconds each coat. It applies well and has a nice texture and brush applicator- it doesn&#x27;t seem to &#x27;shrink&#x27; or pull together like Sensationail&#x27;s does. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that with on the Red Carpet colors I have it seems to alter the color over time - turning it from a purple/pink lavender to a greying lavender. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the color, the curing time, or the different brand top coat. I don&#x27;t have that problem with other colors though so far. This brand is harder to remove than others, but I&#x27;ll take that considering how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> This lasts so much longer than the Sephora brand.  It&#x27;s very shiny too.</li>
    <li> I used these and my gel peeled all the time. I thought I am doing something wrong until I changed it to another brand and it never peeled. The quality is not good</li>
    <li> Works okay.  Seems watery.  Hard to use; wish I could afford to have my nails done professionally.</li>
    <li> Good deal for both base and top coats. OPI gel polish is easy to apply and have a great color available too.</li>
    <li> I am a first-time gel manicure gal.  I tried this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It&#x27;s great, easy to use, and lasted a full 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> If you do it right this stuff does NOT come off. Salon quality at home.</li>
    <li> Great products. I&#x27;ve used them before and will continue to buy them. I like getting both together for one price.</li>
    <li> To be honest, this gel coat is very thin and it seems like it&#x27;s just like a regular top and base coat.  It doesn&#x27;t make my gel color last any longer than if I go against the &amp;#34;rules&amp;#34; and use a regular top and base coat along with a colored gel nail polish coat.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I am impressed of how well it works.</li>
    <li> Great products, I highly recommend this brand if you want to do your gel manicure at home. The top&lt;br /&gt;Coat allow the manicure to shine in an increadible way</li>
    <li> Received this quickly and very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love them. but Top Coat is little softer. I think coat rhinestones completely are difficult.  If you don&#x27;t make nail art then this product is very good!!</li>
    <li> takes time to apply and dry but the durability is incredible</li>
    <li> The base and top coat for the OPI gelcolor polishes.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re necessary, sooooo get them.</li>
    <li> easy to use.  works well</li>
    <li> OPI gel color has beautiful colors, more to my liking than other gel brands.  I bought the items needed for a gel manicure in spite of negative things I read on relevant websites.  I followed all the instructions carefully and watched countless videos.  I tried repeatedly.The stuff just won&#x27;t stick.  It doesn&#x27;t chip, it just lifts off in a single sheet after a few days.  And it shrinks when cured and you simply cannot get it to cling to the free edge.  All as it was said to be on those websites.  Try Gelish instead.  Much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using RCM and very happy except the &amp;#34;pooling&amp;#34;.  I love OPI polish and was happy to see them doing gel now.  I may have done something wrong but followed instructions, read reviews and did research on other sites and the 2 colors I tried peeled off within hours.  too expensive and very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stores were great and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> i had a lot of hopes for this as it is the main brand used when i go get my nails done....i was suprised to see that my polish started to peel or come up after the 7 or 8th day.  kind of disappointed for how much they cost.  some of the other stuff i have that is cheaper works better</li>
    <li> Great product! Works with any light but works best with a salon light</li>
    <li> This the only set I use for gel manicures</li>
    <li> I LOVE the OPI brand for gel nails. They don&#x27;t bubble or wrinkle and they seems to hold up really great with a super shiny coat.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived much quicker than I was expecting am using right now with a non gel polish and my manicure has lasted a week which is a miracle with my job cause you use your hands alot will probably last more than a week if I don&#x27;t decide to change colors before then just received a gelcolor can&#x27;t to try with that</li>
    <li> Package arrived promptly and was exactly what I was expecting.  The product is great and I highly recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected for half the price of the salons. Works great with my eQualle Professional LED Nail Lamp Dryer 36w with Timer. Seller was on time and product is perfect. Will order again soon!!</li>
    <li> i have read some comments this one is better than Gelish, I think it&#x27;s quite similar just gelcolor seems &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; somehow. Removal indeed not too difficult instead.</li>
    <li> Use as directed!! Do Not use too much product ... thin coat works best for me.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the Product!  Easy to apply and am into my second week with no breaks or chipping.  Love the conveniance of DIY gel nails.  OPI has my vote for excellence in nail polish products.</li>
    <li> OPI Gelcolor  is excellent. Other reviewers convinced me that this is the best brand, and I have been quite pleased.</li>
    <li> Compared to Shellac or Gellish this is *very* thin. It also seems to run very easily and despite multiple thin coats easily pits. Was very frustrating to use. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> this was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> they sent me a matte finish top coat, which is no where mentioned in the description. I wanted a regular shiny top coat.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Quality product, good price and arrived earlier than expected. The package was small and the products were well protected. Nothing negative to say about them or OPI.</li>
    <li> OPI Customer for life. I have been using OPI for a long time and now I love their Gels. I am a licensed Cosmetologist now focusing on nail design and these wide brushes and non-fading colors. Love this company</li>
    <li> It is what they say it is. Works great. This gel polish will probably be the only kind I ever buy again.</li>
    <li> This pair is essential for doing a good Gelcolor manicure</li>
    <li> Great thing I buy it for some time now.</li>
    <li> It either peels off or is impossible to get off.  I always have at least one or two nails with no color and it&#x27;s an all day event to remove the ones that didn&#x27;t peel off.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Good price on O.P.I base and top coat gel polish.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this duo from sephora but theres is more expensive so I opted for giving this a try. Works just as great! I love my OPI gel nail kit!</li>
    <li> I always loved OPI and wish the general public had an many choices in gel as salons do. There is no better polish on the market.</li>
    <li> Took forever to dry&lt;br /&gt;I had the light and I wasted literally 3 hours on my nails and then when I went to bed, woke up with everything sticking to my nails. Looked disgusting. Returned</li>
    <li> Love love love OPI brand gel.  Such high quality product.</li>
    <li> PERFECT! Salon quality. I love it over my natural nails</li>
    <li> I expected OPI top and base coat to be as good quality as the gelcolor actual colors. However, this doesnt stay on well, and becomes discolored after just a few days. Im definitely not happy with how this turned out, I will be moving to the Gelish top and base coat that most nail salons use.</li>
    <li> Work great but remember this is only the top and bottom clear coats</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  The best I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; last forever!</li>
    <li> Excellent base and top coat for gel color services...love it!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and shipped very quickly!</li>
    <li> Just as described in product description.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time for Christmas gifting. Person receiving was thrilled.</li>
