      <li>again quick shipping was packaged great</li>
      <li>Whew, it is just very strong.  </li>
      <li>Nothing not to like and entirely pleasant -- but its inability to truly replicate the original costs it a star.</li>
      <li>Be kind to others and don&#x27;t overuse potent men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
      <li>I believe that a cologne splash like this is much more effective than a spray</li>
      <li>However, I mix it 50/50 with Old Spice and the result is wonderful!</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;ll notice a very full bottle kind of leaks.</li>
      <li>it is even better.</li>
      <li>I love it and my women love me to wear it.</li>
      <li>Will buy more when this bottle runs out.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance</li>
      <li>It has always been my favorite.</li>
      <li>I get more compliments from the combination of these two scents that I do for Canoe or Aramis, and those scents are two of my all time favorites.</li>
      <li>It is now my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>And nothing is as potent as the sense of smell.  </li>
      <li>so make sure you buy them online if you like them.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this stuff..</li>
      <li>I wear it the majority of the week and just fell in love with the stuff...</li>
      <li>my favorite inexpensive cologne regardless of reformulation.</li>
      <li>This fragrance brings back many memories and is just delightful.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this scent...</li>
      <li>All in all, probably a cog in anyone&#x27;s fragrance library; not the best, but a must-have, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I have used this cologne for many years off and on.  </li>
      <li>It has been many years since they stopped importing them.</li>
      <li>English Leather is superb.  </li>
      <li>The top isn&#x27;t made with wood anymore...made with plastic</li>
      <li>but as a more subdued version.  </li>
      <li>Just need to apply more of it.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s a great masculine sent !</li>
      <li>It was purely by accident that I discovered how good they smell when combined.</li>
      <li>If one likes this traditional scent, this is a very good value.  </li>
      <li>This smells great and has a masculine scent to it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores any more these days.</li>
      <li>This cologne is considered cheap in my country, but many people used it.</li>
      <li>So he was absolutely delighted we could get it online and so reasonably priced even with shipping.</li>
      <li>Really does a good job at making me smell manly in the morning.</li>
      <li>and I can easily purchase it from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>As she says, &amp;#34;All my men wear English Leather, or they wear nothing at all!&amp;#34; Glad they haven&#x27;t changed the great packaging.</li>
      <li>so it is easy to over-do it when splashing it on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> an old school cologne with nothing but chemicals, but I like the fragrance</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t last like I remembered.  Still, worth it though. Just need to apply more of it.</li>
    <li> In these tough economic times, nostalgia has a powerful calming effect.  And nothing is as potent as the sense of smell.  English Leather is, was, and always will be a smell to conjur up happier, simpler times.  Am I a fanatic, probably.  Is it just what I need to wash of the stench of down-sizing, budget cuts, and the decimation of my 401k and mutual funds, YOU BET!  So spritz your artsie designer labels at $45.00/oz. and I will bask in the glow of a fine English saddlery.</li>
    <li> Classy&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this for a friend, I always love the smell of old fashion perfume and so far this has not disappointed me</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this item, I would purchase it again, it is a good I have used this for a while alternating with other economic type colognes.</li>
    <li> To be modest in writing this review there&#x27;s an awful lot of mud-slinging on English Leather by Dana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The old stuff was a deep orange...almost red.The current formula is more of whiskey color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Still a wooden screw cap almost staying true to the original.The difference is MEM had a plastic plunger in the cap sealing the fluid in if you knock over the bottle...Dana&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have this.Not such a big deal but you&#x27;ll notice a very full bottle kind of leaks.Kept wondering why my wife kept relocating my bottle from the vanity to the medicine cabinet (laughing).But yeah...small flaw there from Dana.Now there was a flaw behind this wooden screw cap design by MEM and most likely over time it will happen with Dana&#x27;s also.The rubber cement that binds the plastic screw cap top to the inside of the wooden cap wears off over time.Your wrist action pulls at the adhesive so one day the wooden part will come off.You could always strip the old glue off and put more glue on or just use the plastic screw cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The most important part of course,the scent and I&#x27;ll start with the original formula by MEM up to a few years before they closed up.Flat out I think this cologne easily could have been called Kentucky Derby.With it&#x27;s soapy lavender,lemon oil,wood,and aged leather accord it does make you think of being at the race track or a barn stable and someone&#x27;s cleaning up an old leather saddle.The dry/dusty wood of the unpainted inside.The lemon oil being the sunshine beaming in...oh yeah very atmospheric in it&#x27;s notes,The wood warms over everything and it becomes powdery and you still get the leather but this is how English Leather changes.What&#x27;s hilarious is people saying thumbs down on Dana&#x27;s formula and to snub it...well(sighs and shrugs)MEM designed this reformulation.A good 2-3 years before they went belly up they changed the bottle artwork.They cut back on dyes used in the aftershave and cologne,and they reformulated it.When Dana picked up English leather in truth they didn&#x27;t touch anything that MEM didn&#x27;t already to do this cologne.The MEM reformulation/Dana formula is a bit different versus it&#x27;s 1st formula for many decades.I get more lemon oil in this which seems to go a different route on the clean factor since the soap has been removed.The leather doesn&#x27;t seem old/worn,smells like a piece of fresh leather from a knife sheath.The wood note is similar,and this does warm over to that powdered wood stage like the 1st formula.The reformulation still smells good but has a tone to it of an old study...different feel but still wearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached Photo in Review:&lt;br /&gt;This is a representation of what MEM&#x27;s English Leather(aftershave pictured) looked like in the last few years they were on retail shelves.You&#x27;ll notice this is where Dana got it&#x27;s artwork.You&#x27;ll notice the fluid color is really light.And you&#x27;ll notice if you look at the bottom of the glass bottle it&#x27;s stamped MEM...I rest my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my argument.I&#x27;ve only been wearing English Leather since the late 80&#x27;s with what became an annual Christmas present from a distant relative for several years, until my first job at 16 to buy my own.So I feel I&#x27;m qualified to say &#x27;yes I watched this cologne change&#x27;.I wear it the majority of the week and just fell in love with the stuff...my favorite inexpensive cologne regardless of reformulation.I can accept someone liking the 1st formula more or not liking English Leather at all.But someone claiming to have worn this cologne 40-50 years yet never caught the change from the original manufacturer over 20 years ago...is a liar.ather in truth they didn&#x27;t touch anything that MEM didn&#x27;t already to do this cologne.The MEM reformulation/Dana formula is a bit different versus it&#x27;s 1st formula for many decades.I get more lemon oil in this which seems to go a different route on the clean factor

    <li> I was disappointed when I opened this cologne.  I have used English Leather cologne for many years but found this item to be washed down and diluted.  I had some remaining cologne and compared the two.  The new item did NOT smell the same nor did it have the same reults when applying to my face.  The older English Leather smelled a lot stronger and had a slight burn when applying; however, the new English Leather did NOT have the same smell and it did not have the same sensation on my face.  I think the company is now diluting their product or not making it the same as they once did.  Poor diluted product and I will not purchase this anymore.</li>
    <li> This item is not for sale in Turkey and I can easily purchase it from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;A true classic and best present for dads.</li>
    <li> My husband loves English Leather but can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  So he was absolutely delighted we could get it online and so reasonably priced even with shipping.</li>
    <li> Really cool and smell so nice. Fresh feeling throught all day I love it when my boyfriend use after shower!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 ENGLISH leather COLOGNES.  I received 2 English Leather After Shaves which I did not want. Now I have to pay for the postage to return them.  I re-ordered and received the correct product but I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ended up paying for postage 2 times to receive one product.  I will think a long time before ordering again.</li>
    <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY.....  I read the bad reviews with people saying that it is not the same as The Original and also read the reviews that said that it is the same. I decided to follow the reviews that said it was the same because there were more of them  and wasted $16.00.. MISTAKE !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know which English Leather these  5 star raters used before, but it was not the real stuff. This stuff is terrible. It doesn&#x27;t even come close to the English Leather that I still have left (an Old bottle  Dana has some nerve to continue to use the name English Leather on this watered down junk.  The only good thing I can say for this is that after about 5 minutes the odor goes away.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the English Leather from the 60&#x27;s  find another product......It doesn&#x27;t exist anymore.</li>
    <li> My husband has always loved this cologne, but it has become impossible to find this on the shelves. So it was fun to surprise him with a bottle of this!</li>
    <li> Love this scent...always have from the 1960&#x27;s.... Do you have the deodorant?</li>
    <li> I selected a high rating because this product has always been a favorite of mine.  I used this back in the &#x60;60&#x27;s and still love it.  The Amazon price was great and I recommend this to other guys.</li>
    <li> English Leather is superb.  I have been unable to find it since I was a young man-years ago. I consider myself fortunate to locate it on Amazon.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;CRE</li>
    <li> Have used English leather for many years. English Leather is difficult to find in my area.</li>
    <li> An excellent all purpose cologne and body splash for men that has stood up well to the test of time. I have used this product for over fifty years and always receive compliments about its pleasing, clean, long lasting and masculine fragrence.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for 40 years and does not like other colignes.  This is only place I can get it.  Thanks for having it available.</li>
    <li> English Leather Cologne has been a toiletry staple of mine since high school 40+ years ago and has consistently drawn compliments over these years.  During this time, there have been various manufacturers of this fragrance (remember MEM?) but it&#x27;s quality has remained consistent.  Whereas I&#x27;ve had some severe disappointments with other \\&quot;classic fragrances\\&quot; lately, the quality of English Leather is holding up quite nicely.</li>
    <li> My sister recently spilled a bottle of this stuff that belonged to my dad. Now our house smells like a cheap hotel room. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have bought this cologne since it came out back in the sixties.  I like its fragrance and my wife, who doesn&#x27;t tolerate most colognes, loves it as well.  It is a great casual everyday cologne.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is prime example of why you should not buy online.  This sewer water does not come close to the original English Leather!  Don&#x27;t Buy It!</li>
    <li> My 80+ year old dad has been wearing English leather for as long as I can remember so I always buy him some for Christmas.  I thought it would be difficult to find, but then I saw a gift box of it for sale at Sears.  Oh well.  This arrived fine, in a timely manner and well packaged and I think the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> My husband Loved this as a christmas gift, he didn&#x27;t know it came in this size, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband.  He has worn it for many, many years and it smells great.  The only difference between this purchase and my other cologne purchases is that the price is a lot better on Amazon that it is in the store!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the English Leather of old.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED ENGLISH LEATHER. JUST WHAT I WANTED.</li>
    <li> Although I like this version of English Leather, it&#x27;s far simpler, less deep and dimensional, lacking the guts and soul of the original -- more wood, less leather. It&#x27;s refreshing, nevertheless, inoffensive and masculine in an unsophisticated but enjoyable way. Unlike cheap-smelling scents, however, this one does work, especially as an unadorned, unenhanced long-lasting sandalwood. Nothing not to like and entirely pleasant -- but its inability to truly replicate the original costs it a star.</li>
    <li> The product arrived early and looked ok, but when I looked at it closely, I saw it was a cologne Splash.  If it contains cologne at all, it is very thin.  The English leather after shave I purchased prior to this is much stronger. I will keep this product, but I would not purchase it again</li>
    <li> I started using this product some 40 years ago, last several years lose track of it. In doing some research, found at Amazon.  I am back using again and love the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked and used English Leather since my days in school in the 1970&#x27;s. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores any more these days. Especially the 8 ounce size. If you&#x27;ve never tried English Leather, I believe you&#x27;ll like it as well as I do. You don&#x27;t need to waste a lot more money on those expensive highfalutin brands.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. This is not the English Leather I remember...bears no resemblance. Fortunately, the soap still smells like the old formula and is still available, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last for more than a minute. That&#x27;s why I bought the cologne but had to wash it off because it smells so obnoxious. What a shame. Guess I&#x27;ll have to look for old bottles online, if they&#x27;re even around. Why did they change a good thing? Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I got this because I&#x27;ve always wanted to know what it was like.  It is a good bargain for the money.  It smells slightly of citrus before you apply it, but when worn and warmed by your skin, it produces a soft and soothing musk smell similar to leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> People say I smell like Baby Powder when I wear this. I like smelling a bit more manly than this..</li>
    <li> very nice, I love the smell of eng. leather....</li>
    <li> I received all around great service from start to finish.  It was a gift and he was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> this stuff is as good as the first time i used it as a teen 20 years ago .... no question it is the same!  maybe the older people have lost their sense of smell as they aged cause it is 100% the same!  i get compliments galore!</li>
    <li> Wonderful cologne. Large value for the money. English Leather is getting hard to find. I liked lime the best. The spiced is also super.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. I tried other colognes and a lot of them smell like dirty socks. This is just my opinion. You don&#x27;t need much to make this last all day. It&#x27;s not that strong but the fragrant does stay with you.</li>
    <li> weaker than expected.  Had to use a lot at one time.</li>
    <li> I wish it came in a spray bottle. But I will stick with it because a certain lady likes it too much. Ha!</li>
    <li> It was great to see English Leather was still around my last bottle I bought many years ago was almost out and my wife found your English Leather on line. It is good to see a great after shave still around for the test of time. Fantastic Carl</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the product and price. It is very difficult to find English Leather but it continues to be popular with my husband. Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Pat Price</li>
    <li> As I mentioned with the stick deodorant, I love English Leather and have used it for over 50 years.  I have noticed the past several years, however, that the scent has changed a bit.  It&#x27;s still my favorite, but it&#x27;s just not the same.  I still prefer it over anything else though.</li>
    <li> Nice to know that this old favorite still got it.  I use it everyday, and I still get that nice all-around fragrance.</li>
    <li> I wore English Leather in High School. I remember the fragrance well. Whatever thus soapy swill is is a mystery, but I would not use it to put out a fire. I have learned my lesson and will never buy a fragrance from Amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;If only I could give less than one star.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but my wife said it smelled like lighter fluid.</li>
    <li> I loved this (English Leather) when I was growing up (teenager) but couldn&#x27;t afford. Well that&#x27;s not the case anymore, love the fragrance, loved the price, shipping was great (even though it had to ship by ground). Will be buying this again, again and again. Thanks for the memories.</li>
    <li> I love English Leather! It brings me back 40+ years when I was a young whippersnapper. I&#x27;ve used it off and on over the years. It has always been my favorite.</li>
    <li> Nothing compares to English Leather in my opion. I still have it on when I go to bed at night. The only thing that will take it off is a shower the next morning. I love it and my women love me to wear it. So I get more loving wearing English Leather. I found it on Amazon.com and they sent it out to me very fast. Thanks to Amazon I did not miss any loving.</li>
    <li> I used and loved English Leather, and was thrilled to see it on Amzn. I decided to ignore all the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Well add me to the list. As another reviewer stated, &amp;#34;English Leather doesn&#x27;t exist anymore.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if this stuff was acceptable, but it really stinks.</li>
    <li> If one likes this traditional scent, this is a very good value.  I believe that a cologne splash like this is much more effective than a spray</li>
    <li> Whatever the stuff in this container is, it is NOT English Leather.  Shame!  I stupidly expected it to be at least similar the the old formulation that actually smelled good.  It isn&#x27;t ... and doesn&#x27;t.  Sad.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> English leather cologne by dana for men is a very good perfume for my old uncle Francis, he smell good</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find. My husband has been wearing it since we started dating back in 1963!!! And He still wears it after 47 years of marriage.</li>
    <li> Great! My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> My large bottle of English Leather arrived on time and in good condition. It&#x27;s a classic scent (by my standards) and I use it frequently. P.S. Be careful if you smoke while using it. It&#x27;s got a lot of alcohol and you could incinerate yourself.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for my birthday in May. This was one of the scents I wore (other was Canoe) while we were dating in the early 1960&#x27;s. She still likes it and so do I.  Why pay fives times as much for &amp;#34;Designer Fragrances&amp;#34; when the tried and true still works after 50 years being together.</li>
    <li> I could not find this colone where we live and this is my husbands favorite.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the good buy amazon</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff.. Hard to find in stores for some reason..My husband has worn this for as long as I can remember..</li>
    <li> This cologne does not have the staying that it use to have. I use to wear it years ago and the fragrance would last almost all day, but not now. I think that Dana has changed the formulation left something out.</li>
    <li> I had complained that I was sent two bottles when I ordered three AND then I complained that my order was for After Shave, not Cologne.  After going back to check my order, I found I did order cologne.  My goof, big time.  Amazon was very graccious and we worked things out.  Truly wonderful service and customer service satisfaction.  I&#x27;m a permanant buyer from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great service, great people.  Can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough</li>
    <li> Have always loved it and happy I could find it at Amazon since my husband also loves it.</li>
    <li> the best , this lotion bring so many good memories,</li>
    <li> This cologne has stood the test of time for sure, many of today&#x27;s men are using girly man cologne&#x27;s, can&#x27;t tell the difference if it was meant for a man or women, but English Leather, definitely was made for Men...</li>
    <li> I will always use English Leather by Dana because i love the smell and it last all day.As long as you carry this product and the price is reasonable i will always buy it from you.Thank you so much for asking me to take this survey i hope it helps.I would hope that other people take the survey as well.</li>
    <li> I loved this cologne on my teenage boyfriend and 46 years later, I still love it on my husband.  Same guy, same cologne. Is there a pattern here?</li>
    <li> Great size for the price. In local stores you would pay more for a smaller bottle</li>
    <li> It was exactly what it was suppose to be.&lt;br /&gt;I have used English Leather since the early sixties.&lt;br /&gt;I wear English Leather or I were nothing at all.</li>
    <li> This smells great and has a masculine scent to it. I&#x27;m 23 so I can&#x27;t comment if this smells like the old English Leather but it smells good to me.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this English leather on my boyfriend. Fantastic product</li>
    <li> I think English Leather smells cheap by itself, at least on me. However, I mix it 50/50 with Old Spice and the result is wonderful! Old Spice is in a class of its own but mixed with English Leather it is even better. I get more compliments from the combination of these two scents that I do for Canoe or Aramis, and those scents are two of my all time favorites. Of course I do not mix Canoe or Aramis with any other scent. I only do that with English Leather and Old Spice. It was purely by accident that I discovered how good they smell when combined. My brother gave me a bottle of English Leather he had received as a gift because he did not like it either but after spraying it on I tried to cover it up with Old Spice. Women stopped me on the street to ask what I was wearing! Sometimes their boyfirends put them up to asking me what the fragrance was I had on. It is now my favorite scent. Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> This cologne is considered cheap in my country, but many people used it. It has been many years since they stopped importing them. I makes me remember those good times.....</li>
    <li> When I was unpacking moving boxes recently I came across a bottle of English Leather that I had had since high school. I opened it up, splashed it on, and was delighted by the familiar old fragrance. After a number of attempts to find this product at retail, I successfully located it on Amazon. The price was right and the shipping was fast. Although some people claim that this product has changed over the years, I cannot tell the difference from the 30 year old product I recently unpacked? This is a great cologne at a great price if you like this fragrance. It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad and he loved it. It has become harder and harder to find these in regular stores lately so make sure you buy them online if you like them. The bottle is big and will probably last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne for man as it has a unique scent that goes well with my body chemistry.  The only drawback of this product is that it is a watered down version, it is not concentrated and one can tell this by the lack of strong aroma.</li>
    <li> Pitiful. If English Leather had smelled like this bottle when I was using it years ago I would never have used it to begin with. Sorry I bought it. Usually I read bad reviews but I don&#x27;t put a lot of credence to them. I was wrong this time.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ALWAYS USED THIS, &amp; AT THIS PRICE, IT&#x27;S GREAT</li>
    <li> Not watered down and just like the old days. Love it.</li>
    <li> Product works as described with no issues.</li>
    <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve found recently on a classic cologne and a scent that takes me back to my adolescence, a woody-earthy-citrus smell I associate with madras, weejuns and summer. It&#x27;s been my favorite for nearly half a century and it&#x27;s a shame that it has receded into near-obscurity, become harder to find, and much more expensive.</li>
    <li> Nice to find this in the larger, 8-oz size.  Really does a good job at making me smell manly in the morning.</li>
    <li> Wife says it smells so good she might just keep me. Very glad to find this here at an affordable price since it is practically impossible to find in a store. As she says, &amp;#34;All my men wear English Leather, or they wear nothing at all!&amp;#34; Glad they haven&#x27;t changed the great packaging.</li>
    <li> I used to love this stuff; my husband did too, and we got some. This is absolutely nothing, Nothing, NOTHING like the original. It smells like some kind of obnoxious cleaning fluid. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Is this the real thing or a counterfeit?  Either way, it&#x27;s disgusting. Not only is it revolting, it&#x27;s a very strong-smelling revolting.  Yuck!</li>
    <li> AAA DEAL FOR THE PRICE----BEEN AROUND LONG TIME BUT VERY GOOD COLOGNE---SHOULD ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION---REAL NICE SMELL FOR ANY TIME</li>
    <li> This product seems to be getting harder and harder to find. Husband has used it as long as I have known him so it is nice to be able to just order it and have it delivered. As they the commercial used to say &amp;#34;All my men wear English Leather, or they wear nothing at all.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> After reading many positive and negatives reviews I took a leap of faith and bought the 8 Oz bottle.  English Leather was my all time favorite for a long time though I haven&#x27;t used any in 20 years or so.  In a nutshell I agree with all the NEGATIVE reviews.  This is a far cry from the original.  Watered down and strange.  I used it once and my wife asked me what I was wearing and suggested I take a shower.  Awful stuff.</li>
    <li> English leather is an excellent cologne. It is understated and not overwhelming. I even collect the bottles with their unique wood cap..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this... horrible. I got this and it s nothing like the original. Not the original fragrance and so diluted down I am shocked that they can sell this without getting into trouble. Whomever is writing positive reviews has to be working for the company because this stuff is terrible.</li>
    <li> Dana is not the original manufacturer .. Mem company.  used to make it but  not since 1996 .when Dana co. acquired it.  Result?? Not the same cologne...actually quite awful... i threw it away.....made in china and reformulated ...ugh....</li>
    <li> Every Christmas I buy my son-in-love some kind of cologne.  I love the smell of English Leather, so this year this is what he received.  He likes it, too.</li>
    <li> Smells as good as it always has. Love the large 8 oz. glass bottle. The top isn&#x27;t made with wood anymore...made with plastic and it isn&#x27;t seamless to open; takes a bit of effort to get the top on and off.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for many years off and on.  This was the first time the cologne aroma lasted only half an hour</li>
    <li> I purchased the English Leather colonge and soap on a rope. The colonge had the worst odor. I used it once and then threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;The soap on a rope had not Englich Leather aroma. That also got tossed. Buyer beware!!!</li>
    <li> English Leather is a classic fragrance that I have been trying to find for years now. This fragrance brings back many memories and is just delightful.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and he was very happy. I had a hard time finding this product at stores but you had it</li>
    <li> Same quality for 50 years.</li>
    <li> I used this years ago and thought I&#x27;d go back to it.  Whew, it is just very strong.  Gives me a headache. I don&#x27;t remember it being this powerful.</li>
    <li> Yes the same smell as my older one that is just about empty.</li>
    <li> I have purchased both Dana and Mem E.L. products (I graduated in 65 when the world where I lived reeeeked of this stuff). The Dana product might not be as potent as 50 year old vintage Mem  All Purpose Lotion, but that may be a good thing. It is not spray-on with this container, (where you can spray it in the air and  let some fall on you) so it is easy to over-do it when splashing it on. Just opening the container for a minute in the bathroom is enough to detect it in there for the rest of the day. Be kind to others and don&#x27;t overuse potent men&#x27;s colognes. Your olfactory senses may not detect it all day, but the world around you will.</li>
    <li> Not like the original, but I guess its as close as I&#x27;m going to get.</li>
    <li> This item was not as advertised. It turned out to be the Cologne &amp;#34;SPLASH&amp;#34; --- a cheapened version of the Cologne. I was unable to return it under Amazon&#x27;s hazardous materials return. They shipped it to me, why couldn&#x27;t I return it???! If it is advertised as Cologne, it should be cologne and not the cheapened &amp;#34;Splash&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the &amp;#34;Splash&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using English Leather exclusivley for many, many years. What I just recieved  is not the same product, this is an inferior substitute.</li>
    <li> The product illustrated (English Leather cologne) was not the product delivered (cologne splash).</li>
    <li> In order to make any cologne&#x27;s fragrance less likely to precede your arrival I reverted to an old technique that we used in my father&#x27;s barbershop.  Some of the aftershave lotions were a little too strong to use following a shave as some customers had sensitive skin.  We would dilute products such as AquaVelva and Clubman aftershave lotions with Witch Hazel.  It still provided a mild skin tightening, or astringent, affect but with far less of the alcohol sting.  We would educate the customers about this as many would indicate that they liked the fragrance, but that it delivered too much of a literal &amp;#34; slap-in-the-face &amp;#34; or that they would receive comments about using too much product.  We found that Witch Hazel was the best aftershave for those afflicted with acne and would often advise using the Clubman or similar on the arms or back of the neck as opposed to applying it to the face.  Mixing the English Leather with some Witch Hazel provides the same fragrance but as a more subdued version.  It has nothing to do with the co$t.  The E.L. cologne is pretty strong stuff and the Amazon price is significantly lower than other online providers.</li>
    <li> Excellent product great smell I would recommend</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Priced well and on time.</li>
    <li> A sort of meek scent with strong undertones of an a funereal home. Not a great buy especially at the price.</li>
    <li> Very heavy scent. Smells completely different in the bottle than it does on my skin. It smells like just pure manly, spicy leather out of the bottle. I only notice the citrus on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t really get the middle notes here. Seems to fade straight into the woody &amp; leather base notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent&#x27;s not bad per se. It&#x27;s in its own class in a way. Other scents are &#x60;English Leather&#x27; scents - it&#x27;s hard to put this in a category. It&#x27;s extremely cheap &amp; saying that EL is &#x60;nothing fancy&#x27; is an understatement. It&#x27;s very base &amp; cloying - but not altogether in a bad way. It&#x27;s not that bad of a scent, but it is also very mature. Using it for a couple hours (very lightly mind you) is fine, but after a couple of hours on me - there&#x27;s just something that tells me that I&#x27;m much too young to be wearing this. There&#x27;s a bit of old mannish-ness to this. The scent itself would probably get a thumbs-down if that was all I was considering. It&#x27;s tolerable if you&#x27;re going by scent alone IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dies down after about 6-7 hours on me, so it&#x27;s got pretty decent longevity. The sillage is good. You barely have to splash any on this stuff is so strong. It also has the ability to be offensive if you&#x27;re wearing too much. I imagine that EL is a bit of an acquired fragrance. All in all, probably a cog in anyone&#x27;s fragrance library; not the best, but a must-have, especially for the price. A thumbs-up from me reflects EL&#x27;s history, notoriety, price, and decent scent.</li>
    <li> I have always loved English leather it&#x27;s a great masculine sent ! for the price and the size of bottle you cannot go wrong I&#x27;ve never found it this cheap anywhere I will definitely order from this company again quick shipping was packaged great you can&#x27;t go wrong order some !!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my Dad for Christmas.  He has been wearing this ever since I can remember, and it is hard to find the cologne splash in the store.  He does not like the spray.  It still smells like I remember, very consistent.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this for decades, but I still like the musky smell.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Taste is subjective but if you don&#x27;t like to smell like a fresh flower consider this cologne. I have used this cologne for years and have always liked its fragrance. It also seems to last longer than other products I have tried. Will buy more when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> English Leather...for Men!</li>
    <li> Yes may get the black next time</li>
    <li> Tengo mas de 30 a&amp;ntilde;os utilizando este Producto, para mi es excelente . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Have used this product since I was a teen, and have&lt;br /&gt;always gone back to it.  There have been additions to their&lt;br /&gt;product line but no real changes.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift - husband really likes it.</li>
    <li> paid and recieved right away&lt;br /&gt;my dad very happy I found some of his favorite cologne&lt;br /&gt;i will buy more very soon</li>
    <li> Very swift delivery although cap came loose and about one third of product spilled would recommend tape on cap</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like.  This is the stuff I enjoyed in college and many, many years later, I still like it.  Of course it really doesn&#x27;t matter if I like it, but it does matter if my bride does and she does, all these years later.</li>
    <li> If i don&#x27;t wear english leather I don&#x27;t wear anything at all.  That just about says it all.  Thank you</li>
    <li> good old English leather.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for someone who loves English Leather and can&#x27;t get out to get his own.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY fragrance on my husband of 41 plus years that turns me on.  It&#x27;s not easy to find in stores.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.</li>
    <li> Great cologne.  An old fashioned, but unique, fragrance.  My wife gave me some early on when we were first dating over 50 years ago and I have loved it ever since.  I prefer the cologne over the after shave because you can still get whiffs of it throughout the day.  This is the original product even though the packaging has changed somewhat.  Check out this fragrance in the after shave version and see whether or not you like it and if you do, order it this way.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and what I epected.</li>
    <li> A user of English Leather from the 70s or 80s will not like this new version.&lt;br /&gt;I had not bought any since around 1985. Thought I would give it a try again&lt;br /&gt;stay away from this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want a good English Leather smell buy the Black version It has a much stronger better smell&lt;br /&gt;It cost more but the smell is closer to the old style of English Leather then this is. I bought&lt;br /&gt;this with a bottle of Brut and British Sterling of the 3 the Brut still smells like the original&lt;br /&gt;the other two which are made by Dana have changed. A word to the wise when you get it right the first time leave it alone.</li>
    <li> Had only found the tiny bottles in the store.  He was very excited to receive this size as a gift.</li>
