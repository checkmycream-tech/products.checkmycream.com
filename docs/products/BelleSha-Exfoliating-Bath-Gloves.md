      <li>LOVE THESE</li>
      <li>Be sure to wash after each use and allow the gloves to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love to use loofahs or mesh poufs in the shower, so I knew I would enjoy trying these exfoliating gloves.</li>
      <li>I was contacted by a rep for BelleSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on</li>
      <li>Great for elbows, knees, grime, paint, even left over wax removal.  </li>
      <li>After using them, I noticed that my skin was really smooth.</li>
      <li>no matter how lightly I scrub.</li>
      <li>So smooth after using.</li>
      <li>so far so good , they do what they are supposed to do</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall these are nice dual-purpose gloves and are highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>These stretch well and stay put even with in the presence of rich soapy lather.</li>
      <li>Very feminine without being too over the top.</li>
      <li>Both are very pretty colors.</li>
      <li>Works great on cleaning the dirt off our sphynx - used by both male and female hands and fit well.</li>
      <li>enjoy using these as I find them invigorating to my skin - most especially my hands and feet.  </li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>Yuck, right?</li>
      <li>The problem I have with them is that they started to unravel after the first use</li>
      <li>One is a beautiful true purple color and the other is pink.</li>
      <li>I used to buy these other great ones from my local walmart</li>
      <li>It would be nice if gloves like these had a little loop at the wrist</li>
      <li>My wife absolutely loves these things and has one pair in the bath and one pair in the kitchen.  </li>
      <li>They really do work.  </li>
      <li>they really do work....</li>
      <li>I am a very tall guy....</li>
      <li>Most likely made as adult women&#x27;s sized gloves, but will also work for teenagers.</li>
      <li>These were a decent price point and Prime eligible.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these gloves.</li>
      <li>I especially enjoy using them on my tired feet in a hot bath at the end of a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fun to use, the pink ones are much brighter than the picture.</li>
      <li>Very soft like a wash cloth.</li>
      <li>Like many/most BelleSha products I&#x27;ve reviewed, the product is both generic and at a higher price point than the competition.  </li>
      <li>Not too harsh and not too smooth....</li>
      <li>it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me be totally upfront here, these work really well.</li>
      <li>So be careful when using on sensitive areas for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Do be careful on sensitive areas the first time using these and don&#x27;t overdo it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know if it was because I have never really exfoliated before and was extra sensitive or because I was applying to much pressure or because the gloves themselves were just made to be a high level of roughness.  </li>
      <li>Just right to get dead skin off.</li>

<li> Just right to get dead skin off.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t last to long.</li>
<li> With that said, my loofah doesn&#x27;t always get said dry skin off of my body.</li>
<li> I suffer from extremely dry skin.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t have a tag to hang them up though, so I have to poke my shower caddy into them to hang dry.</li>
<li> so you could hang them up to dry after you shower.</li>
<li> /&gt;The gloves should be rinsed well and allowed to dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Probably too small for an adult man.</li>
<li> I get less acne using these gently on less sensitive parts of my face (i.e. cheeks, chin, forehead and around my nose and mouth) than using a chemical cleaner.</li>
<li> When I saw these I ordered them only to discover that they are no better than the ones you get at Wal-Mart for far less money.  </li>
<li> The gloves are too small for me and I am not a big guy standing at only 5&#x27;8&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Not at all what I expected from BelleSha.  </li>
<li> Too rough on my skin.</li>
<li> Yes they are pink and purple.  </li>
<li> They stay on when being used, create lots of suds, and they aren&#x27;t overly rough like some others I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
<li> I use one pair on myself and the other pair for bathing my Sphynx cats.  </li>
<li> Use one pair for yourself and share the other pair or  use one pair in the bath and use the other pair in the kitchen to wash veggies.  </li>
<li> They felt all little rough on other places though</li>
<li> I add a little body wash to the wet glove and cleanse the skin.</li>
<li> so the gloves are tight....</li>
<li> I can get in the shower, use my loofah, get out of the shower, rub an area on my body and still feel dead skin.</li>
<li> I do feel a little weird with pink or purple gloves on....</li>
<li> but they changed their common brand they carry.  </li>
<li> Those ones are just too delicate.  </li>
<li> With these gloves, it has been a game changer.</li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>

    <li> Works great on cleaning the dirt off our sphynx - used by both male and female hands and fit well.</li>
    <li> BEST LOOFA GLOVES EVER!!! LOVE THESE I USE THE SECOND PAIR TO WASH MY PETS!! GIVES A GOOD SCRUBBING!!</li>
    <li> I just bought these, and I used them just last night. I love them. After using them, I noticed that my skin was really smooth. These gloves don&#x27;t hurt the skin at all. After using it you will feel like you just left the spa.</li>
    <li> For a while now I&#x27;ve been using gloves like these instead of chemicals for exfoliating. I get less acne using these gently on less sensitive parts of my face (i.e. cheeks, chin, forehead and around my nose and mouth) than using a chemical cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works well would buy again</li>
    <li> Too rough on my skin. Feels like bathing with sandpaper no matter how lightly I scrub. Threw them away and that&#x27;s all I have to say...</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves these things and has one pair in the bath and one pair in the kitchen.  It turns out that besides being nice for scrubbing and exfoliating people these gloves are also great for washing fruits and vegetables in the kitchen sink.  Think of them as a bath ball made into a glove and you&#x27;ll understand the texture of these gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these are nice dual-purpose gloves and are highly recommended.  I was provided with a sample for the purposes of a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> Will use on car. Very soft like a wash cloth. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt for properly gritty gloves for the shower.  I used to buy these other great ones from my local walmart but they changed their common brand they carry.  Those ones are just too delicate.  I&#x27;m a city dweller and I have to get the grit off my body and face, so those just won&#x27;t do.  These ones are nice and scratchy.  Great for elbows, knees, grime, paint, even left over wax removal.  Delivered as ordered and timely.  Yes they are pink and purple.  They don&#x27;t have a tag to hang them up though, so I have to poke my shower caddy into them to hang dry.</li>
    <li> They really do work.  I do feel a little weird with pink or purple gloves on....but heck I am in the shower...so who knows....but me.  I am a very tall guy....so the gloves are tight....&lt;br /&gt;but they really do work.... I have tried a lot of brushes etc......and they are cumbersome...not so with these......  Pour your soap or cleaner into the palm and go to town.  Not too harsh and not too smooth....just right.  Love em</li>
    <li> These exfoliating gloves come in pairs, but can be used on either hand. The colors are more intense and attractive than they appear in the photographs on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made of a knitted synthetic fiber that provides a moderate exfoliation.  They work well with a soap or body wash to make a nice lather.  I especially enjoy using them on my tired feet in a hot bath at the end of a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful on sensitive areas the first time using these and don&#x27;t overdo it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves should be rinsed well and allowed to dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BelleSha provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected from BelleSha.  I bought a pair 10 years ago from a bath shop in the mall.  I still have them and use them for every shower I take.  I thought I&#x27;d try and get a replacement.  When I saw these I ordered them only to discover that they are no better than the ones you get at Wal-Mart for far less money.  It would be nice if gloves like these had a little loop at the wrist so you could hang them up to dry after you shower.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last to long. I only had them for about one month and the strings are already coming out and looking raggedy.</li>
    <li> These bath gloves fit comfortably and seemed like a good one-size-fits all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using these as I find them invigorating to my skin - most especially my hands and feet.  These felt heavenly in those two areas.  They felt all little rough on other places though and I don&#x27;t know if it was because I have never really exfoliated before and was extra sensitive or because I was applying to much pressure or because the gloves themselves were just made to be a high level of roughness.  So be careful when using on sensitive areas for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves come in two pairs with two different colors.  Use one pair for yourself and share the other pair or  use one pair in the bath and use the other pair in the kitchen to wash veggies.  Be sure to wash after each use and allow the gloves to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin. With that said, my loofah doesn&#x27;t always get said dry skin off of my body. I can get in the shower, use my loofah, get out of the shower, rub an area on my body and still feel dead skin. Yuck, right? With these gloves, it has been a game changer. Not too rough but not too soft. Just right to get dead skin off. I feel a big difference in my skin after just one use. I also love the colors of these gloves. Very feminine without being too over the top. Great price too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed here are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> These were okay. They don&#x27;t give you a real good exfoliation, but they are decent.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliating gloves. These stretch well and stay put even with in the presence of rich soapy lather. Fun to use, the pink ones are much brighter than the picture. Most likely made as adult women&#x27;s sized gloves, but will also work for teenagers. Probably too small for an adult man.</li>
    <li> These were a decent price point and Prime eligible. They seem to do a good job exfoliating in the shower.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! So smooth after using.</li>
    <li> I just adore the Exfoliating bath gloves by BelleSha. They come with 2 pairs of gloves. One is a beautiful true purple color and the other is pink. Both are very pretty colors. I love to use loofahs or mesh poufs in the shower, so I knew I would enjoy trying these exfoliating gloves. These gloves are great!  The gloves fit my hands perfectly.  I add a little body wash to the wet glove and cleanse the skin. It is a great way to exfoliate all of your body. I highly recommend these gloves. Especially if you like loofahs or body poufs.  I received this product at a promotional discount to try and provide my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> so far so good , they do what they are supposed to do</li>
    <li> The problem I have with them is that they started to unravel after the first use</li>
    <li> *Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for BelleSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me be totally upfront here, these work really well. They stay on when being used, create lots of suds, and they aren&#x27;t overly rough like some others I&#x27;ve encountered.  Oh yeah, and, you get two pair, perfect for those who share a shower with someone else.  The reason for my middling star rating is price.  Like many/most BelleSha products I&#x27;ve reviewed, the product is both generic and at a higher price point than the competition.  As yet, I&#x27;ve not seen there to be a value to be had by purchasing the BelleSha branded items over cheaper generics.</li>
    <li> I use one pair on myself and the other pair for bathing my Sphynx cats.  They work great on all of us!</li>
    <li> The gloves are too small for me and I am not a big guy standing at only 5&#x27;8&amp;#34;.</li>
