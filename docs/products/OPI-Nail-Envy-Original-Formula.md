      <li>I need to order more for my brittle nails!</li>
      <li>It is an amazing product.  </li>
      <li>This polish is amazing.</li>
      <li>It has nothing to do with the Nail Envy, it&#x27;s your own nails that turn themselves a yellowwish tint.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of hardener or polish you use.</li>
      <li>I am now receiving compliments from people on how nice my nails look.  </li>
      <li>They also get a nice sheen after applying the nail strengthener.</li>
      <li>A manicurist recommended this product to me and I&#x27;m glad she did.  </li>
      <li>I am on my 5th bottle of Nail Envy and I love it.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s going to take more time.</li>
      <li>Also the only store I&#x27;ve been able to purchase this at is ulta and their price is over $16 I found it on amazon for under $8 so great buy!!!!</li>
      <li>Did I mention I LOVE this product??</li>
      <li>The polish is very shiny and looks great all the time - almost \\&quot;wet\\&quot; looking.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I am SO glad I could find this on amazon, it was a fraction of the cost compaired to what I paid at the salon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Biggest con is that on both the bottles I&#x27;ve had the plastic brush assembly has become stuck to the top of the bottle and then separated from the rest of the cap.</li>
      <li>My nails have maintained their strength and are back to their happy, healthy state!</li>
      <li>Prefer to use it as a top coat as I wish to have a light color on my nails.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I will continue to use this product to keep my nails strong and so will my friends.  </li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t mind your nails looking like that, than it&#x27;s fantastic just because of the strenthining part of the product.</li>
      <li>Wife seems to enjoy it</li>
      <li>I prefer the original nail envy because of the shine.  </li>
      <li>B001ARSVJO OPI Nail Envy, Original Formula]]I&#x27;ve been using OPI Nail Envy for years</li>
      <li>I put 2 coats on the first day, then 1 coat on top every day for 5 days.</li>
      <li>I found this not to be true.  </li>
      <li>Since using OPI Nail Envy Nail Strengthener, for only a short time, my nails are looking great!</li>
      <li>The original formula is the best and works on my thin brittle nails.</li>
      <li>It really helps keep nails strong and prevents peeling.</li>
      <li>and i have followed the directions as instructed and my nails are soooo much durable and stronger!!</li>
      <li>If you want long nails, you should use this amazing product, without it I would never have been able to have the lovely long nails I have today.</li>
      <li>I hardly ever wear color as I more into showing off my healthy natural nails and this product has me very pleased right now.</li>
      <li>I will certainly purchase this product again and again!</li>
      <li>Of course the first month or so was just growing out the damaged nails from the gel and of course that process was grow, break, grow, break, but now that the damaged nails have all grown out</li>
      <li>It also has a nice wide brush.</li>
      <li>I saw a change in my nails after the first week, but continued just in case.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for exactly one month</li>
      <li>and I had difficulty at first with telling whether it had chipped off or not.</li>
      <li>This one really works unlike others I have tried!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Which I think is pretty unattractive, seeing as I don&#x27;t smoke at all.</li>
      <li>After starting to use this my nails have stayed a much more uniform length.</li>
      <li>the new natural healthy nail is doing well</li>
      <li>I just use this alone for my fingernails and it leaves a nice clear, whitish finish (sometimes people think I have a french manicure with it on).</li>
      <li>She has been using it for 4 weeks and her nails are getting long and look healthy.</li>
      <li>and I actually have ten decent looking nails that I can now file into a good looking shape.  </li>
      <li>It really strengthens my nails and it doesn&#x27;t turn yellow or chip easily.</li>
      <li>Another big plus is that this is incredibly quick drying!</li>
      <li>Product really works and I have used it for 2-3 months.  </li>
      <li>It helps that it dries fast also.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic stuff for people who would like stronger nails and the ability to actually grow your nails out.</li>
      <li>Also it helps to soak your nails in lemon juice or make a paste of lemon juice and baking soda and scrub your nail gently and they will whiten again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Thanks OPI.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s an excellent base coat -- it keeps your polish securely in place.</li>
      <li>Wow!!!</li>
      <li>I use Nail Envy faithfully and my nails grow long and strong.</li>
      <li>Using it as a top coat and as recommended applying every other day.</li>
      <li>I have been using OPI Nail Envy Original for several years now.  </li>
      <li>It sells in retail stores for nearly twice the price that I consistently find on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I was a little nervous buying it for the price stated as this is such a good deal.</li>
      <li>So needless to say I am going back to what I found in the past to work the absolunte best at letting me grow my own nails.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly and product was just as expected.  </li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and did not turn my nails yellow.  </li>
      <li>One lady, in particular, was having problems with her nails splitting.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My nails have never grown out my whole life; even with professional manicures.  </li>
      <li>Loving this base coat, so glad I purchased it!  </li>
      <li>I have previously been getting gel nails from the local nail salon and wanted to go natural with my own nails.  </li>
      <li>The matte is very natural looking</li>
      <li>First I want to reply to the review about Nail Envy making her nails look like smokers nails or yellow colored.</li>
      <li>Anyway today my nails are growing very well and are strong and hard.  </li>
      <li>Before my nails would get to a certain length and then break off and all my nails would be different lengths.</li>
      <li>but it goes on clear.</li>
      <li>I like all O.P.I. products thus far with the exception of the Matte finish.</li>
      <li>My 88 year old mother bought OPI Nail Envy.</li>
      <li>But I do think this is a defect in the bottle/cap design and should be fixed.</li>
      <li>The manicurist was surprised to see it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best base coat/strengthener I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This nail strengthener is a major component of my nail care and has attained the status of \\&quot;cannot live</li>
      <li>After wearing acrylics for years, my own nails would not grow past the free edge, were thin and brittle.</li>
      <li>then i&#x27;m right back into typing,filing, and the polish is dry with no worries.  </li>
      <li>I love using it as a base coat for manicures, and I keep it on my nails all of the time even without a manicure on top.</li>
      <li>Definitely the best base coat</li>
      <li>It works great as a base coat, apply two coats onto nail then two coats of any nail polis and a good too coat and nail polish won&#x27;t chip or peel for at least 5 days!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this after I noticed my usually strong nails were becoming weak (thin, peeling, breaking). I followed the instructions (two coats initially, one coat every other day after for a week, remove at the end of the week and start process again) for a couple weeks, but used no other polish (even though it said you could). I saw a change in my nails after the first week, but continued just in case. Then I started again with colored polish using Nail Envy as a base coat. My nails have maintained their strength and are back to their happy, healthy state!</li>
    <li> After wearing acrylics for years, my own nails would not grow past the free edge, were thin and brittle. Since using OPI Nail Envy Nail Strengthener, for only a short time, my nails are looking great! I will certainly purchase this product again and again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product have used it for years.  Have not been using it for the last six months or so and was trying another product and my nails are trash.  So needless to say I am going back to what I found in the past to work the absolunte best at letting me grow my own nails.</li>
    <li> Product really works and I have used it for 2-3 months.  My nails are stronger now than ever before.  Price, shipment and ordering were great and I would definitely buy from this supplier again as I ordered three bottles for what I would pay for one in the salon.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this product,as i have never purchased OPI before.  All i can say is the reviews persuaded me to swallow and fears and order it. It had been only 3 weeks and i have followed the directions as instructed and my nails are soooo much durable and stronger!! It helps that it dries fast also. I apply a coat on my break at work then i&#x27;m right back into typing,filing, and the polish is dry with no worries.  I even applied color to and it has held up great. I will begin using the OPI Maintenance as suggested on the OPI site once this bottle is gone.  Hopefully by that time, Amazon will begin selling that product as well.  It is suggested that once your nails have reached their max potential with this product, you transition to the Maintenance formula.  Thanks OPI.</li>
    <li> Loving this base coat, so glad I purchased it!  My nails have not looked this good in ages.  Definitely the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This is my third or fourth time ordering this product. I love using it as a base coat for manicures, and I keep it on my nails all of the time even without a manicure on top. It really helps keep nails strong and prevents peeling. I highly recommend this product. It sells in retail stores for nearly twice the price that I consistently find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> A manicurist recommended this product to me and I&#x27;m glad she did.  It has done wonders for strengthening my nails.  I have encouraged several of my friends to use it also.  One lady, in particular, was having problems with her nails splitting.  Since she started using OPI Nail Envy, she has had no more nail splitting.  I do find, for me at least, that it caused my nails to turn blotchy white.  But since I keep my nails polished, it doesn&#x27;t matter. The manicurist was surprised to see it.  So it must not be common for everyone.  Nevertheless, I will continue to use this product to keep my nails strong and so will my friends.  It&#x27;s the best base coat/strengthener I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This nail strengthener is a major component of my nail care and has attained the status of \\&quot;cannot live without\\&quot;. It is completely awesome. Before my nails would get to a certain length and then break off and all my nails would be different lengths. After starting to use this my nails have stayed a much more uniform length. I&#x27;ve used both the glossy and the matte. The matte is very natural looking and I had difficulty at first with telling whether it had chipped off or not. Once this stuff comes off your nails they are no longer protected so you have to be diligent about keeping up the routine. (I&#x27;ve been slacking lately, lol.) Another big plus is that this is incredibly quick drying! It also has a nice wide brush. I usually wear it without any colored polish and when I randomly used a polish with a regular sized brush I was irritated with how small the brush was, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest con is that on both the bottles I&#x27;ve had the plastic brush assembly has become stuck to the top of the bottle and then separated from the rest of the cap. It is easily fixed by unsticking the brush assembly and then putting the cap back on it firmly. It just sticks right back up in the cap and you can continue to use it, but I don&#x27;t tighten it very tightly. But I do think this is a defect in the bottle/cap design and should be fixed.</li>
    <li> If you want long nails, you should use this amazing product, without it I would never have been able to have the lovely long nails I have today. LOL This is Garys wife by the way not Gary!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and product was just as expected.  I have used it for years, but it was just getting too expensive in the stores.  Much more affordable with Amazon!</li>
    <li> While I will say it does make your nails stronger, i have noticed that after a couple weeks of using it, it made my nails look like smokers nails. Which I think is pretty unattractive, seeing as I don&#x27;t smoke at all. But if you don&#x27;t mind your nails looking like that, than it&#x27;s fantastic just because of the strenthining part of the product.</li>
    <li> A house guest left this at my house so I tried it.  It worked so well, I bought another bottle at Amazon.  I was shocked how long my nails got and didn&#x27;t chip.  My nails have never grown out my whole life; even with professional manicures.  I just use this alone for my fingernails and it leaves a nice clear, whitish finish (sometimes people think I have a french manicure with it on). It is an amazing product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It lasts a long time and makes my nails almost impossible to break.</li>
    <li> I have VERY weak nails that would peel and break. My hairdresser suggested I try this which I&#x27;ve been using for about two months now. It does seem to be helping, they don&#x27;t peel like they used to (although they sometimes still break) I think it&#x27;s going to take more time. However I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to purchase it again because it was expensive. That&#x27;s why I am SO glad I could find this on amazon, it was a fraction of the cost compaired to what I paid at the salon.</li>
    <li> I had never enjoyed decent nails in my life until I was introduced to OPI nail envy nail strengthener by a cosmetology friend of mine about 10 years ago.  I had sculptered nails for about 15 years and really enjoyed the look but came to hate the constant balances plus the cost of the upkeep.  I had them removed and began using OPI nail envy strengthener.  I prefer the original nail envy because of the shine.  I have tried what seems like every nail strengthener product on the market and this has helped me to have nails I am not ashamed to show off.   Thank you OPI and please don&#x27;t change your formula!</li>
    <li> If you are simply looking for a product to strengthen your nails...this will do just that. It&#x27;s fantastic stuff for people who would like stronger nails and the ability to actually grow your nails out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the end of Jan 2011.  I have previously been getting gel nails from the local nail salon and wanted to go natural with my own nails.  Of course my nails were in bad shape after removing the fake nails which I had only been wearing for about 3 or 4 months.  So I purchased this OPI Nail Envy after doing some research to specifically find a hail hardner that had formaldehyde resin in it.  I had success in the past with a similiar product including that ingrediate but they don&#x27;t make it any longer.  Anyway today my nails are growing very well and are strong and hard.  Of course the first month or so was just growing out the damaged nails from the gel and of course that process was grow, break, grow, break, but now that the damaged nails have all grown out the new natural healthy nail is doing well and I still have half the bottle of this product left.  It is a little pricey but well worth it.  I would suggest when you apply it you give enough time for the first coat to dry, or soak into the nail, before applying to 2nd coat.  I am now receiving compliments from people on how nice my nails look.  I do go back to the nail salon sometimes and have had them give me a manicure and use this product.  I hardly ever wear color as I more into showing off my healthy natural nails and this product has me very pleased right now. I did try and some pictures but theres only the option for video.</li>
    <li> Since I started wearing Nail Envy under all my manis, my natural nails have had FAR less breakage/tearing. Also, it&#x27;s an excellent base coat -- it keeps your polish securely in place. It looks whitish in the bottle but it goes on clear. I&#x27;m so pleased with it that it&#x27;s now my default base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT -- months later, still wearing the Nail Envy under all my manis. Just came by to order a new bottle since mine is almost empty. Did I mention I LOVE this product?? My nails have stopped breaking and they have grown really long now. Ladies are shocked when I tell them they are not acrylics, and then I let them in on my secret: Nail Envy! ;)</li>
    <li> I like all O.P.I. products thus far with the exception of the Matte finish. The original formula is the best and works on my thin brittle nails.</li>
    <li> I recieved my order (two bottles of nail envy) 3 business days after ordering it. I couldn&#x27;t find a better price any where else and the service was great. I actually received my package sooner than I thought I would. I received emails confirming every step with a tracking number for me to track it myself as well from the supplier and Amazon. I am impressed with the service I recieved by both companies and will definetly order again. Thank you both.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work as advertised. Nails look healthier. They also get a nice sheen after applying the nail strengthener. Wife seems to enjoy it so I will buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing. It really strengthens my nails and it doesn&#x27;t turn yellow or chip easily. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for this item.</li>
    <li> Prefer to use it as a top coat as I wish to have a light color on my nails.  Using it as a top coat and as recommended applying every other day.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It works great as a base coat, apply two coats onto nail then two coats of any nail polis and a good too coat and nail polish won&#x27;t chip or peel for at least 5 days!! I&#x27;ve had it stay on for up to 9 days before I&#x27;ve had one chip!! Also the only store I&#x27;ve been able to purchase this at is ulta and their price is over $16 I found it on amazon for under $8 so great buy!!!!</li>
    <li> My 88 year old mother bought OPI Nail Envy. Her nails where peeling and cracked from age and working in the garden without gloves. She has been using it for 4 weeks and her nails are getting long and look healthy. Stress has caused my nails to split. After only 2 weeks of using Nail Envy I have noticed the ridges are looking smoother.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my nails even worse. I did use for about 4 months.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001ARSVJO OPI Nail Envy, Original Formula]]I&#x27;ve been using OPI Nail Envy for years and I was a little nervous buying it for the price stated as this is such a good deal. Some reviews I read said it had turned their nails yellow leading them to think the product was old.  I found this not to be true.  I purchased 3 bottles.  They arrived quickly and did not turn my nails yellow.  This is a wonderful product for problem nails at a great price.  Will continue to purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> This is all I have used on my nails for years, so happy to find at a lower price.  I will order again</li>
    <li> I have the worst nails ever - brittle, peeling, and chipping.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for exactly one month and I actually have ten decent looking nails that I can now file into a good looking shape.  The polish is very shiny and looks great all the time - almost \\&quot;wet\\&quot; looking.  I&#x27;ve been working in the garden for the past week (yes, I&#x27;ve been wearing my gloves) and I&#x27;ve been washing dishes and doing housework with no gloves.  Not one nail has chipped or peeled.  Now after one month I have great looking medium length nails that even my co-workers are  noticing.  Over the years I think that I&#x27;ve tried almost every product out there to grow nails and nothing has worked like nail envy. Wow!!!</li>
    <li> First I want to reply to the review about Nail Envy making her nails look like smokers nails or yellow colored. It has nothing to do with the Nail Envy, it&#x27;s your own nails that turn themselves a yellowwish tint. Your bare nails need to breathe or they will get the yellow tint. Doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of hardener or polish you use. If your nails are covered week after week that&#x27;s when they yellow. I am on my 5th bottle of Nail Envy and I love it. I put 2 coats on the first day, then 1 coat on top every day for 5 days. Take the Nail Envy off and let your nails breathe for 2 days then reapply the Nail Envy. Also it helps to soak your nails in lemon juice or make a paste of lemon juice and baking soda and scrub your nail gently and they will whiten again.&lt;br /&gt;My nail break and peel due to having my hands in water alot with cleaning and I also have 3 Maltese that get bathed every 10 days. I use Nail Envy faithfully and my nails grow long and strong. I have told lots of friends about this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Does everything it says and then some.  I need to order more for my brittle nails!</li>
    <li> This one really works unlike others I have tried!</li>
    <li> I have been using OPI Nail Envy Original for several years now.  A friend of mine recommended it to me.  I have found it to be the perfect bottom coat.  I use two coats before I brush on the nail color.  It does a good job to help maintain my manicure.</li>
