      <li>The smell is just delightful and not heavy like other similar products out there.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but I love the fact that I can find an outstanding product like this one for $20 less than if I bought the same exact item at Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would not use this for summer since it will make my skin very oily</li>
      <li>delivered very sooner than  the estimated date.  </li>

      <li>Another high quality product from Shiseido, my skin has been transformed.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m turning 30, and have recently moved to Los Angeles, been wearing make up lots for work, so my skin has been suffered so much from sun/pollution and starts to show lines and large pores.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Does not seem to work any better than any other cream, especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>I tried this  high quality brand four years ago but the product got my skin turned to red</li>
      <li>No other product I have used has ever had this effect!</li>
      <li>I am very picky in what to put on my skin (we only have one skin) especially on my face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other Shiseido products for quite some time and have found them to be very beneficial for my skin.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m lucky enough to have no red skin like in the past product.</li>

<li> I am afraid I am addicted.</li>

    <li> without that eye-burning spf this night emulsion is so gentle it will not sting you even if you accidently get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great reason plus it is a superior moisturizer and twice as effective when the balancing enriched toner is applied first after cleansing. Salesmen constantly think I am in my forties but next month I will be 64,&lt;br /&gt;If your lotion says on the label avoid eye area then it should not be on your face at all.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this Shiseido line for many, many years.  She raves about it, and is very happy we can get products for less than at the high-end skincare counters.  She like the way it makes her skin feel and appear.  She certainly doesn&#x27;t look 81 years old!</li>
    <li> OK for sensitive skin, but I can&#x27;t say I see much change.  I will use the bottle but not repurchase.</li>
    <li> best to use in winter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product to use, it smells great, easy to apply, a little goes a long way. After a month, I could tell the improvements with my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shiseido face cream for many years.  I have very sensitive eyes and their product is one of the very few I have found that does not irritate them.  This supplier sent the order very quickly and the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> Shiseido makes the best products. Can go without them. My face feels great when I wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because of what it was promoted to do. From what I am hearing, it is doing what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Shiseido is a favorite of my wife and never a disappointment. She has been using the creams for many years.</li>
    <li> I am using this for a week now, and me and my husband is working in Middle East in which the hot weather is very harsh to the skin. however , this product is excellent to protect your face and quality is incomparable to more expensive ones!</li>

The smell is just delightful and not heavy like other similar products out there.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh looking whether I use it in the morning or before I go to bed.  And as I stated earlier, for the price you cannot beat the value.</li>
    <li> It is a night cream for normal to combination good skin is quite smooth, with little product is sufficient. I Love the face of this brand.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream 2 - 2.5 weeks ago, and didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I \\&quot;see\\&quot; the changes. I use this product and the eye cream. I was told to keep the eye cream in the fridge for better result, but I store them both in the fridge cos I like the cool feeling of the cream when I put it on my face :). I am blessed with very great Asian skin (thank you Mom!!), no zits/ achenes, just freckles. But I&#x27;m turning 30, and have recently moved to Los Angeles, been wearing make up lots for work, so my skin has been suffered so much from sun/pollution and starts to show lines and large pores.&lt;br /&gt; After 2.5 weeks, I see my skin starts getting much softer and it glows! I am very picky in what to put on my skin (we only have one skin) especially on my face. And i&#x27;m not saying this cream will work on everyone&#x27;s face. But it works wonder for mine and I definitely give it two thumbs up and would buy it again! &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shiseido Benefiance WrinkleResist24 Intensive Eye Contour Cream Eye Puffiness Treatments&lt;br /&gt;Shiseido Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkleresist24 Night Emulsion</li>
    <li> Nice, but my husband is allergic to the smell.  Does not seem to work any better than any other cream, especially for the price.  I&#x27;ll stick with Oil of Olay&#x27;s Regenerist.</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s the same as the product sold in the mall or at shiseido stores. Just sold for a more awesome price!</li>
    <li> Love this product , less expensive through this store then Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Wife bought this and uses it at night.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Amazing, it works on wrinkles and fine lines, makes you look younger</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I have only been using this a few days, but I notice the difference.  My skin is more even, softer and just feels healthy.  I have combination skin, and so far this feels like a perfect fit.  I will update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I use it also for the day because it has no sun screen (I am allergic ti sun screen)</li>
    <li> After one week of use the results are already amazing...already getting complements on my skin! It has surpassed my expectations! No other product I have used has ever had this effect!</li>
    <li> love this beauty product line. I have very sensitive skin and had the opportunity to ask for a sample of several of their day and night cream products to try it on first. And it did great in my skin, love the scent that leaves on my skin and love the way it feels on it. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> Ik ben erg tevreden over dit product, het voed de huid terwijl ik slaap.&lt;br /&gt;Wat wil je nog meer van een nightcreame</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle at Macys store. I tried this  high quality brand four years ago but the product got my skin turned to red so I stop since then. Last 2014, I decided to give try again since many people this brand is great for Asian skin. It is now winter season in DC and I&#x27;m lucky enough to have no red skin like in the past product. However, I do have some residue oil on my face in the morning (not much, and maybe because I have 3 layers of skin care products on my face to protect my skin from being dry in winter).&lt;br /&gt;I may use this product again for winter seasons. I would not use this for summer since it will make my skin very oily (I have combination skin in summer and dry skin in winter).</li>
    <li> Another high quality product from Shiseido, my skin has been transformed.  No skincare line is a miracle worker, but my skin has improved exponentially.</li>
    <li> Just received this product this last week, put it on,it was like silk . I just love the product .  Soft touch to the skin , smooth.</li>
    <li> Expensive but a lovely product.</li>
    <li> I am afraid I am addicted. This feels amazing on my skin. My makeup goes over it very smooth and evenly. I also use it at night.</li>
    <li> This is surprisingly effective, but not thick or greasy. It glides on and stays on all night, much different from other moisturizers that disappear after a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for thirty years!</li>
    <li> Hard to not love Shiseido; wish we could get the price lower though.</li>
    <li> delivered very sooner than  the estimated date.  Very satisfy</li>
    <li> Have always love Shiseido and have used it for years.</li>

    <li> I gave 5 stars on this because it was a great price, came on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Ever since I used this product my skin felt more smooth and not dry. This is my only night ritual. It is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Thanks love it a very good seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this emulsion for my mom as a present for International Women&#x27;s day.&lt;br /&gt;She truly loves it, saying that it improves skin tone and skin quality :)</li>
    <li> Soft feeling, easy to apply, just feels good on my face!</li>
    <li> 20 year usage, love this product</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and have used this product for a short period of time. I&#x27;ve used other Shiseido products for quite some time and have found them to be very beneficial for my skin. I find this product helpful with moisturizing but have yet to notice any differnce in the fine lines around my mouth. I&#x27;m hoping after a few weeks I&#x27;ll see the same type of improvements that I&#x27;ve noticed with my other Shiseido products.</li>
    <li> I have used Shiseido products for more than 10 years and the results have been great.  I get many compliments on my youthful looking skin. The night emulsion is fantastics and feels very comfortable before going to bed.</li>
