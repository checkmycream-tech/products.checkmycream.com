      <li>I got a feeling that the set had been stored for some time as the top coat thickened and wasn&#x27;t drying well.</li>
      <li>Also the travel bag is cute and compact.</li>
      <li>Cute travel bag.</li>
      <li>My nails are getting better looking,</li>
      <li>Super cute!</li>
      <li>I ended up buying full sized bottles once I sampled and liked.</li>
      <li>Love the Nail Envy, goes on nice and dries fast.</li>
      <li>I have never been more impressed by a try me kit before and have recommended and even given a few as gifts.</li>
      <li>The nail polish wipes work great with the remover, as good if not better than cotton balls.</li>
      <li>The case is cute and I wanted it, the remover didn&#x27;t last long but worked well, the wipes are great for removing and you get a good amount.</li>
      <li>Such a pretty bag and great products.</li>
      <li>Now that I have, I will be buying the full size products offered by this brand.</li>
      <li>Just buy full sizes bottles.</li>
      <li>Good variety of basic nail care basics from who else - OPI.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>The nail strengthener is NOT a gel, drys quickly, and you can see and feel a difference in your nails within minutes.</li>
      <li>The remover and pads make quick work of polish removal.  </li>
      <li>it is great quality, my daughter loves it, and it is sturdy enough to protect her new phone.  </li>
      <li>Great little bag with &#x27;must have&#x27; nail care.</li>
      <li>And the wipes really are lint free.</li>
      <li>The nail polish remover actually smells nice and not chemically.</li>
      <li>A little smaller than I expect, but perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>OPI is often a very pricey brand, and I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay full price just to try it.</li>
      <li>This was a set of three which I wasn&#x27;t aware of in the beginning</li>
      <li>This is a really nice little kit for traveling.</li>
      <li>The Nail Envy really works.  </li>
      <li>Came v fast .packed</li>
      <li>The only thing that i didnt like was the nail polish remover wasnt completely filled.</li>
      <li>My only wish was that the top coat bottle was full-sized, because for some reason the small brush you get with the mini&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work very well with the top coat.</li>
      <li>It is small enough to fit into most bags and it contains almost everything you would need for a manicure.</li>
      <li>Make sure the cap is tight on the nail polish remover or it will leak.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>You can fit up to 4 other mini-polishes inside along with the contents.</li>
      <li>The drying coat and no chip coat do exactly as they describe and also dry withing minutes.</li>
      <li>not sure if it&#x27;s because I am paying more attention to them now that I have this little kit, or if it is the Nail Envy that is helping them.</li>

<li> I now understand what other brands are trying to aspire to.</li>
<li> The other two products fix chips and smears</li>
<li> It had room for me to add a few of my essential items despite the small size.  </li>
<li> This is a lighter version than your typical manicure kit so no worries flying with it.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re all very very very small though.</li>
<li> i just didnt like that one of them got ugly during shipping</li>

    <li> This is a really nice little kit for traveling. You can fit up to 4 other mini-polishes inside along with the contents. The nail polish wipes work great with the remover, as good if not better than cotton balls. My only wish was that the top coat bottle was full-sized, because for some reason the small brush you get with the mini&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work very well with the top coat. Every thing else works great. Love the Nail Envy, goes on nice and dries fast. My nails are getting better looking, not sure if it&#x27;s because I am paying more attention to them now that I have this little kit, or if it is the Nail Envy that is helping them. Still for traveling it is the best.   Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Super cute! Perfect size to take on the go. Has the essentials</li>
    <li> Bought this to try the OPI line.  The Nail Envy really works.  The remover and pads make quick work of polish removal.  The other two products fix chips and smears so you don&#x27;t have to re-do one nail.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to try a bunch of products at once. OPI is often a very pricey brand, and I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay full price just to try it. Now that I have, I will be buying the full size products offered by this brand. The nail polish remover actually smells nice and not chemically. The nail strengthener is NOT a gel, drys quickly, and you can see and feel a difference in your nails within minutes.

    <li> This was a set of three which I wasn&#x27;t aware of in the beginning but since I travel that&#x27;s perfect.  This is a lighter version than your typical manicure kit so no worries flying with it.  I can also choose to gift some.</li>
    <li> Just buy full sizes bottles.The case is cute and I wanted it, the remover didn&#x27;t last long but worked well, the wipes are great for removing and you get a good amount. I take my own tools when I get my nails done so the bag was perfect. I ended up buying full sized bottles once I sampled and liked.</li>
    <li> Came v fast .packed nice.used o.p.i.nail polish prior. Like there items. But smaller then picture.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This set makes a good travel nail kit.  It includes all the basics.  It had room for me to add a few of my essential items despite the small size.  Make sure the cap is tight on the nail polish remover or it will leak.</li>
