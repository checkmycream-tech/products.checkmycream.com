      <li>Definitely pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I remember this as a kid in England and it seems like my Mum used it for everything, great product and received in super fast time.</li>
      <li>It does not seem to be available at retail stories here in the USA.  </li>
      <li>Thankful to have found it and have available.</li>
      <li>Nice to find a company give great service by mailing it to me, and by not charging an excessive amount.</li>
      <li>I was so Happy to find a seller, because this is only sold in the UK, and it&#x27;s worth the special order.</li>
      <li>It also has a clean fresh scent to it.</li>
      <li>Heals all sorts of cuts and bites so quickly - and eases pain and itching.  </li>
      <li>The itching stopped immediately and the bite healed quickly.</li>
      <li>I dropped a very hot glass dish from the oven and burned my hand, not severe</li>
      <li>It is great when you get those little cracks around your fingertips in the winter.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This cream smells to high heaven.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I normally order it through Amazon or eBay.  </li>
      <li>It worked better than any other topical antibiotic I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>However, I did think it would get rid of warts, but so far I have not had any luck with that.  </li>
      <li>Or if you ever get fits of eczema like me, this topical analgesic far trumps the healing affects of all the Neosporins, Benadryl creams, and so on.</li>
      <li>This product is far superior to most things available over the counter in America because it has lidocaine in it to help numb the painful area while the cream helps clear small infections.</li>
      <li>Very strange, maybe old stock?</li>

    <li> It is a very good soothing cream.  However, I did think it would get rid of warts, but so far I have not had any luck with that.  I will recommend this ointment for cuts and scapes, though.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years Great product.</li>
    <li> Always have a tube of Germolene with me. Works on cuts, scratches,insect bites. Excellent value and service and will replenish my supply from this company. Have used Germolene for years and although it is an ointment now,not as thick as it used to be, it still works as well. Always recognize the germolene scent_ love it.</li>
    <li> it was everything we thought it should be</li>
    <li> I LOVE Germolene. Joking that I just look at the tube &amp; start healing, but recently purchased some from England. It arrived EVENTUALLY, but all of the tubes have now shrunk &amp; are virtually  empty! Very strange, maybe old stock? I would not buy this product again from the sellers for this reason.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t buy this cream here in the USA - it is non greasy, works wonders on insect bites and sores. I miss it!!! Nice to find a company give great service by mailing it to me, and by not charging an excessive amount.</li>
    <li> Great product for burns. Delivery faster then expected</li>
    <li> This cream smells to high heaven.  If you would like my 4 tubes, just let me know.  Maybe you had better luck than I.</li>
    <li> I have post herpetic neuropathy in the spinal area on my back from Shingles I had in 2003.  My caregiver rubs this cream on&lt;br /&gt;my skin and it actually relieves the pain I have.  This is a marvelous product that has enough Anesthetic in it to relieve the pain.&lt;br /&gt;If you try it, I don&#x27;t think you will be dissatisfied.  The price is great too since 2 tubes are delivered for each order.  I have&lt;br /&gt;purchased 10 sets now to distribute to family and friends for their external aches and pains.</li>
    <li> Have been using Germolene for over 47 Years and is the best thing out on the market. I remember it being in a tin. This is 5 star buy.</li>
    <li> I dropped a very hot glass dish from the oven and burned my hand, not severe but it was very painful. After placing my hand in cold water I applied Germaine cream, I could not believe how fast  it relieved the pain and the healing time also was shortened.</li>
    <li> What is great about this is that it soothes pain. I cut the bottom of my toe this morning and it was hurting quite a bit. I put this on and a band aid and I don&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
    <li> Picked up a tube of this in Ireland for myself when a friend asked that I get her some in 2007.  I call it my miracle cream.  Heals all sorts of cuts and bites so quickly - and eases pain and itching.  Ordered several tubes this time so I could give one to a co-worker who had a nasty spider bite that was slow to go away even after antibiotics and other things he tried.  He now calls it his miracle cream as well as it eased the itching during the last stages of healing.  My Mom uses it for her eczema.</li>
    <li> Friends had purchased this cream while in London.  I was at their home, fell, cut my elbow, so asked if they had any Neosporin.  They said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;, but had Germolene.  This cream is amazing.  It started healing my cut, which was a good one, in no time.  I ordered some as soon as I got home.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this ointment has been around for years,best ever</li>
    <li> Who needs more antibiotics?! Finding only antibiotic cream here in the USA we continue to purchase Germolene from England. This cream is gentle on the skin, soothing to the wound and / or bites and aids in the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for years. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> Item was as described, arrived quickly and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product when a friend from England gave me some to put on a mosquito bite. The itching stopped immediately and the bite healed quickly. I strobgly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This heals just about everything. I&#x27;m from England and missed this so much. Very happy to be able to get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is far superior to most things available over the counter in America because it has lidocaine in it to help numb the painful area while the cream helps clear small infections. It also has a clean fresh scent to it.</li>
    <li> yep...&lt;br /&gt;sure did/does I&#x27;m sensitized to neomycin products so Germolene is perfect  for me</li>
    <li> We usually purchase Germolene when visiting relatives in England.  My husband has been using this since he was a child.  It is perfect when you have a wound.  Put it on, cover with a bandaid and within hours the healing is amazing.  It is way better than Neosporin.  Keep a tube at home and carry when you travel.  It is great when you get those little cracks around your fingertips in the winter.</li>
    <li> Product came on time, works great &amp; was at a great price. Definitely pleased with this product. Recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! So much better than A&amp;D or Neosporin!! Heals cuts, burns and abrasions fast! We even use it on bug bites. Definitely a household must for us!</li>
    <li> Great phenol-based product. Kills bacteria without use of antibiotics.</li>
    <li> for the preparation&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Love this.  I&#x27;m from England and it was used all our lives. Thankful to have found it and have available.</li>
    <li> I was so Happy to find a seller, because this is only sold in the UK, and it&#x27;s worth the special order. Summer time heat rash, can be such a bummer. Or if you ever get fits of eczema like me, this topical analgesic far trumps the healing affects of all the Neosporins, Benadryl creams, and so on. It came in a pack of two, and took about a week and a half to get here. I am SO pleased! Thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with the speed my orders arrived.  Everything was well packaged and arrived intact.  thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I remember this as a kid in England and it seems like my Mum used it for everything, great product and received in super fast time.</li>
    <li> My mom from england she use to have this shipped over to her all time And I swear by this stuff works better then anything iv used here I&#x27;m the states I recommend trying it at least once you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> Great product to have for my kids injuries.</li>
    <li> The ointment is better, but no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;Use as foot cream, prevents foot odor, and is emolient</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t a pack of Two......there was only one tube.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.  Love  it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was a little girl and it&#x27;s as good as ever! I would never have gotten through that acne stage without it. I had 6 tubes shipped to the USA and am hoarding it for the cuts and scratches that never cease to happen.</li>
    <li> I found Germolene in a pharmacy in London in 2010 while looking for adhesive bandages and a topical antibiotic.  The pharmacist plucked Germolene off the shelf and suggested I try it.  It worked better than any other topical antibiotic I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> We have used this cream successfully for a number of years and started when we lived in the UK.  It does not seem to be available at retail stories here in the USA.  I normally order it through Amazon or eBay.  We rebuy because we like the way it works.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff. I highly recommend.</li>
