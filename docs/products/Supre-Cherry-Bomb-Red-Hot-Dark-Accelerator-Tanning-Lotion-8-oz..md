      <li>this by far is the BEST tingle lotion out there.  </li>
      <li>This is so far the best tanning lotion ever!</li>

      <li>Ok for the price.</li>
      <li>For the price, Cherry Bomb smells great and works very well as a tingle lotion.</li>
      <li>After tanning, you should barely be able to smell it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and how this lotion applies.  </li>
      <li>EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARNT FOND OF CHERRIES WOULD LOVE THIS LOTION.</li>
      <li>but it changes to a lovely tan within 30 mins to an hour.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I really love this productwill order more when am out &amp;</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I have really fair skin, but I am able to use this when I tan and i tell a difference right away.</li>
      <li>although pleasant at first lingers for 6-8 hours making the scent unbearable.</li>
      <li>It can really make you &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;, but had a very nice effects on my body.</li>
      <li>Very excited.</li>
      <li>This lotion has an amazing scent with just the right amount of &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>It kind of feels like mild pins and needles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed for this price the results this lotion gives , and I have spent more for lotions not getting these results.</li>
      <li>The bright redness that is gives your skin surface (don&#x27;t panic!) makes it much more easy to increase the darkness of your skin in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>but I really wish I could because I did get good color results.</li>
      <li>You do turn bright red for a couple hours after using the product but it fades into a nice tan.</li>
      <li>It is a strong tingle lotion</li>
      <li>strong tingle</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot it got me tan very fast</li>
      <li>The dark tan is incredible!!!  </li>
      <li>I was fine, got out</li>
      <li>It seemed to get hotter throughout my whole 16 minutes max of tanning and wear off nicely after about an hour after you get out.  </li>
      <li>This lotion works great especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times and it always manages to give my skin a great boost of color.</li>
      <li>I used it once&amp;I have never burned or felt so itchy in my entire life!It smell&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>For experienced tanners only.</li>
      <li>I would rate this lotion as a no tingle / light tingle lotion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;M AN ADVANCED TINGLE USER, AND US TINGLE LOVERS KNOW THAT THE LOTION SOME TANNERS SAY IS \\&quot;SO HOT\\&quot;</li>
      <li>The color of your tan is nice after you use the whole bottle.  </li>
      <li>This is a hot tingler, so make sure you have a couple hours for the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; look to wear off.</li>
      <li>First off love the scent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give off a strong sweet smell but rather a mild scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the lotion at all...was not what I expected and didn&#x27;t realize it was used will not make that mistake again</li>
    <li> I ordered the Super Cherry Bomb Red Hot Dark Accelerator for in door tanning it has the tingle in it and you can feel the tingle some it&#x27;s not really hot i&#x27;m just now starting to go to tanning bed now i been four times it&#x27;s a good product even if your starting out to tan.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this once I received it and to my surprise the tingle factor wasn&#x27;t too hot or too weak it was just right.  It seemed to get hotter throughout my whole 16 minutes max of tanning and wear off nicely after about an hour after you get out.  It has a very strong cherry scent but it does calm down after you are done tanning.  It gives you a very good boost of color as soon as you get out of the bed.  The redness starts to go away and leaves you with a good bronze glow.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long though but it still is a great deal for the price.  Perfect lotion to use in the winter to warm you up.  No messy bronzers or streaking which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have order a couple of different bottles of lotion from you&#x27;s and you guys never have let me down. Thanks for that. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that this bottle open before I got it and some spilled out :(</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I am a college student in Florida with limited time to spend on the beach. I&#x27;ve used similar products in tanning beds but I decided to try it at the beach. It works VERY well and I recommend it to anyone who needs a quick tan with limited time! You do turn bright red for a couple hours after using the product but it fades into a nice tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times and it always manages to give my skin a great boost of color. And the tan I get if very dark and actually natural looking, which tends to be an issue with me when it comes to tanning lotions, even tingles. However, I do wish it would last longer just because it is such great color, but that&#x27;s usually the case with all tingle lotions from my experience.  The smell I actually like, which has never happened with a lotion before. It&#x27;s very sweet and like cherries and does fade nicely after use. (I hate smelling like tanning lotion.)  As far as the tingles go, it is a pretty moderate sensation, but nothing burning or anything crazy like that. And even if it did, for the color I get it&#x27;s worth it.  Overall, the best tingle lotion I&#x27;ve tried and you can&#x27;t beat that price. Will definately continue to buy.</li>
    <li> For the price, Cherry Bomb smells great and works very well as a tingle lotion. It doesn&#x27;t have bronzers in it, but if all you&#x27;re looking for is a tingle lotion to intensify your tan, Cherry Bomb is worth a shot. I switch between tingle and tingle with bronzers for my legs, as sometimes using too many bronzers can cause build up. This one is a good one &#x3D;).</li>
    <li> The front of the bottle says \\&quot;hot dark tanning accelerator\\&quot; and the back says \\&quot;with a little bit of heat\\&quot;. Do not be mislead, it is hot! I thought the smell was excellent (therefore the one star rating), but it is HOT...like a fresh sunburn after hours of sitting in the sun. I used the lotion and was in the tanning bed for about two minutes and BAM...hot, hot, terrible burn. I jumped out and began to wipe the stuff off of me. There was a red rash for half an hour and the tingle took at least that long to subside. Purchase this product with precaution!</li>
    <li> I have to say this is one of the better smelling lotions I have tried, but not impressed with color results. As an experience tanner, I expect more from my lotion. Ok for the price. Pay a few more dollars for a better lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great especially for the price. It smells real good also. I am pretty tan, so I didnt get extremely noticeably red, and the tingle was not uncomfortable at all. This lotion did make me tanner after one use. I have used it in a tanning bed and outside with the same results. Glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t have much tingle ,have used tingle lotion before this didn&#x27;t heat up at all ,,,,,it was ok not what I was looking for though</li>
    <li> Nice lotion.  Does smell like cherry before you tan.  Not sure on the smell after you tan.  I would rate this lotion as a no tingle / light tingle lotion.  I have had different lotions that set you on fire and this is not one of them.  The color of your tan is nice after you use the whole bottle.  I would purchase this lotion again due to the price. The color of the lotion is a cream color.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a tingle and I thought it was pretty easy to handle, not too hot. The smell is AMAZING plus I didn&#x27;t notice an ATO at all. I was red for two hours at most but I could tell my skin was noticeably darker later on. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I get a tanning membership every year for a month right before summer, so obviously I need to get as dark as possible within that time period. I got this lotion about two weeks ago and it&#x27;s great; but, as a warning, for me, it is intensely hot. I have used 80$ tingles that haven&#x27;t had this reaction on me. When I come out of the bed, it feels like have an instant sunburn all over my body, and then it goes away within 15 minutes. So weird, but at least it does what its supposed to do</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone who is not familiar with HOT tanning lotions.  I had a horrible reaction to the product.  My skin burned and was red in spots for 2 days.  I had to get out of the tanning booth after about 5 minutes as I was red as a beet and burning.  Only experienced HOT tanning users should try this.</li>
    <li> it was delivered quickly. smells wonderful. BUT i got maximizer not accelerator...</li>
    <li> Be careful! It can really make you &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;, but had a very nice effects on my body. Smells good and gives you a nice color. But : I accidentally touched my face a while after I used it and my face was on fire!! So was your hands after use!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff nice smell and a dark color can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> This accelerator is awesome! The smell is nice and fruity and does not leave any after tanning odor.&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are not bronzers that just stain your skin and wash out in the shower as I am fairly pale and need to maximize my true skin color, nt just tint my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Supre is a great budget friendly lotion that still has great skin care and works like the higher priced lotions.</li>
    <li> I HAD MY SALON ORDER ME THIS LOTION AFTER SEEING IT ONLINE. I AM AN EXPIERENCED TANNER AND HAVE OWNED LOTS AND LOTS AND I MEAN A LOT OF DIFFERENT LOTIONS. DESIGNER SKIN, ED HARDY, SUPRE TAN, PRO TAN, AUSTRALIAN GOLD...BRONZERS, TINGLES, INTENSIFIERS, MAXIMIZERS, ACCELERATORS...YOU NAME IT, I TRIED IT. SO BACK TO MY EXPIERENCE WITH THIS LOTION. I&#x27;M AN ADVANCED TINGLE USER, AND US TINGLE LOVERS KNOW THAT THE LOTION SOME TANNERS SAY IS \\&quot;SO HOT\\&quot; SOMETIMES ISN&#x27;T. THIS LOTION HAD ME HOT WITHIN 2 MINUTES INSIDE THE BED. I ALSO MUST SAY BEFORE I GOT IN THE BED, AND WAS APPLYING THE LOTION, THE SALON WORKER YELLED INTO ME THAT MY LOTION SMELLED AMAZING. MY SALON HAS AN OPEN CEILING IN EACH ROOM, SO SMELLS CAN TRAVEL. IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL LIKE CHERRY COUGH SYRUP EITHER, ITS A NICE CHERRY BERRY AROMA. EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARNT FOND OF CHERRIES WOULD LOVE THIS LOTION. SO I&#x27;M IN THE BED, AND I&#x27;M HOT. THE WHOLE TIME I HAD HOT ACTION. I GET OUT OF THE BED, GET DRESSED AND THE GIRL WAS LIKE OHH MY GOSH! LOOK IN THE MIRROR! I WAS BLACK! IT GOT ME SO DARK FROM ONE SESSION! I APPLIED THIS LOTION TO MY FACE AS WELL AND I WAS FINE! THIS LOTION USES CHERRY SEED EXTRACTS TO HEAT YOU UP, AND IT WORKS SO GOOD. I TANNED WITH THE LOTION AGAIN, AND A DIFFERENT GIRL WAS WORKING, I CAME OUT AND SHE WAS SHOCKED AT THE COLOR I GAINED DURING THE SESSION! I HAD TO IMMEDIATLY COME ON HERE AND TELL ALL THE TAN-A-HOLICS ABOUT THIS LOTION! FOR SUCH AN EXCELLENT PRICE THIS IS THE LOTION TO BUY. I&#x27;M LIKE THE REST OF YOU, WHEN I READ A REVIEW I THINK THAT MIGHT BE JUST AN OPINION, WELL THIS REVIEW IS FACT. I AM DARK, BUT WE ALL REACH A PLATEU WHERE WE CAN&#x27;T GET DARKER. THIS LOTION DID THAT. ITS A HOT ACTION MAXIMIZER, SO IT BREAKS YOU THROUGH THAT TANNING PLATEU WE ALL HAVE. BUY THIS YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT!</li>
    <li> Just ordered my 3rd bottle! I love this lotion! It works so good and you have results so fast. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable but has just enough tingle to let you know it&#x27;s working. A great buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing special. It does smell good and definitely adds heat but I don&#x27;t feel like it;s made me an darker. Maybe I just never stay in the sun long enough.</li>
    <li> Watch out, this definitely contains some tingle which surprised me. It works well and the bronzer is pretty strong.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Indoor tanning lotion creates awesome flush.  Even color and no staining on hands or clothing.  A little tingle but not uncomfortable.  Worth  it for the results. Definately recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome Stuff!!! Quick ship!!!</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I have tried many different types of tanning lotions and by far this is the best one I have tried. The tingle is not over powering, yet it is enough to make me red which in turn tans you. After one use I was at least 2 shades darker, and it smells awesome. Its really nice that it smells good, since some are just awful.</li>
    <li> Great tan within a few days! The fragrence is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I used a sample of this product today when I tanned. I tanned for only 12 minutes, and after 4 minutes my face was burning so bad i had to cover it with a towel. I could barely last the full 12 minutes in the bed as the lotion made my whole body feel as if i was frying! I was BRIGHT red for about 3 hours after, and now am developing a deep tan color. The lotion smells yummy, but it was just far too intense of a tingle for me. I would not use this product again, because i was extremely uncomfortable for 3 hours following the tan. If you can deal with the heat then I would say go for it.. not for everyone!</li>
    <li> For experienced tanners only. This is a hot tingler, so make sure you have a couple hours for the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; look to wear off. Works great on my ethnic skin so I can have a sunkissed look year round. Great stuff and compares with more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! This is so far the best tanning lotion ever! You must try it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is hot but after about the third time u use it u can&#x27;t feel it as much but it works very well. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Great value and really a great tingle for the price!  You won&#x27;t regret it!  If you are sensitive , then don&#x27;t purchase,  only true tanners need to apply!</li>
    <li> Was very impressed with this lotion! But if you&#x27;re looking for something hot  this is not it.</li>
    <li> I really love this productwill order more when am out &amp; the service was great !!! Buy everyone now ...</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t have the tingle I was looking for</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! At first the tingle can be a bit much, especially if you&#x27;re in a 12 minute bed or anything stronger, but it is not painful and can easily be tolerated. I notice a dramatic change in my tan when using this lotion. You will be a little pink at first but it changes to a lovely tan within 30 mins to an hour. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it because my tanning salon sells this lotion for $21 a bottle!</li>
    <li> It is very intense the first few times of use. So if you have sensitive skin, I would recommend trying it on a small part of your skin for the first few times. The smell is wonderful, and you do come out a little red and hot, but within a few hours you are literally shades darker, even in a level one bed. If you are a fan of hot lotions, I definitely recommend this, because for the price the results are fantastic. Just as good as any other fifty dollar hot lotion.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! GOT REALLY DARK USING THIS!! A MUST HAVE FOR A SERIOUS TANNER!! FANTASTIC, IMMEDIATE RESULTS!! WILL BUY AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> got my order on a timely manner. love this product and the fact that they put their card with it so i can order again with out trying to figure out who i ordered it from.</li>
    <li> First off love the scent. Works great as far as getting my skin really dark. If you are using it for the first time I suggest mixing it with some basic non tingle lotion. It wasn&#x27;t hot to me but my boyfriend tried it for the first time and had to wash it off because it was to hot for him. Try it on your legs first and if it&#x27;s too hot rinse under cold water. Shipped and received fast too</li>
    <li> I liked it a lot it got me tan very fast and you didnt feel like you were on fire, it smelt very good as well. i will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I had an allergic reaction to this lotion or what, but it burnt me soo bad!&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I had already been tanning before this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I was so itchy afterwards, i had to speed home and jump in the shower!</li>
    <li> This lotion was not HOT by any means. It is probably the worst tanning lotion I have ever purchased. I am an experienced tanner and have never had a lotion give me red little bumps afterwards that made me itch. Not sure if I had an allergic reaction or not, but I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. I am completely dissatisfied with it!!!</li>
    <li> I tan on a regular basis so my skin is not sensitive to the tanning bed light&#x27;s or the sun.I have no allergie&#x27;s.I like buying my tanning lotion&#x27;s on amazon because they are much cheaper&amp;I can read review&#x27;s to see which is a good one.I have very good luck with the last 2 I bought on here,but wanted something to make me a little darker.I read the review&#x27;s on this one&amp;thought it sounded great.I used it once&amp;I have never burned or felt so itchy in my entire life!It smell&#x27;s great yes.But I would not advise anybody to buy this product.Sorry!</li>
    <li> Loved it!  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My first tingle was Swedish Beauty and that is a very mild tingle. This one isn&#x27;t much hotter in my opinion. It smells just like cherries and doesn&#x27;t have an awful ATO either. I do get great color from this lotion, and I would recommend this to an experienced tanner whose looking to heat up there session.</li>
    <li> I must say that I&#x27;ve been tanning since I was 17 (now 41)  I&#x27;ve used every brand of tanning lotion on the market and this by far is the BEST tingle lotion out there.  Used 3 times and I&#x27;m nice and tan.  It is a strong tingle lotion so if that&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re used to, then don&#x27;t get this for your first time use.  I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> could be a little stronger</li>
    <li> I had not tanned in a while and wanted to get dark quick. In 1 use I swear I am at least  2 or 3 shades darker . You really have to spread this evenly though. The tingle is not very intense which I like. After using I was red for a few hours but it faded into a tan . I&#x27;m impressed for this price the results this lotion gives , and I have spent more for lotions not getting these results.</li>
    <li> First off if you have never used a tingle tanning lotion before keep looking because this stuff is serious!!!&lt;br /&gt;I already had a pretty good base tan and thought I&#x27;d step it up.... Well it was a bit too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;In the tanning bed I was fine, got out color was great Not to much red but very nice dark color to my skin. Then about 10 minutes later I felt like I was being bitten by fire ants! It was so intense I had to sit in a tub of cold water for about 45 minutes and then slather aloe lotion on every 5 minutes after that. This lasted about 2 hours total. Needless to say I haven&#x27;t used it since but I really wish I could because I did get good color results.</li>
    <li> it can be hot but  not really that bad the product is good for mid level tanners and it is worth a try</li>
    <li> This lotion is EXCELLENT!  Leaves skin feeling soft and with a light fragrance.  The dark tan is incredible!!!  I used early in my tanning. It is not too hot but you can feel a warmth when using.</li>
    <li> I seriously was on fire when I put this lotion on!  I&#x27;ve been tanning consistently for a couple of months and thought I&#x27;d try this out.  OH MY GOD my legs and arms were burning/throbbing so bad I was getting scared that I was having some sort of reaction to the product!!!  After I got home my husband had to laugh at me, I was redder than a lobster.  I&#x27;m sure it will settle into a nice tan but there is no way I will be putting this on my skin again!</li>
    <li> product came as it sounds I just wasn&#x27;t a fan of the lotion</li>
    <li> Out of all my tanning lotions purchased I will give this a high rating.excellent color and is not fading.would definately recommend and I wpuld purchase this lotion in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion, however I would not recommend it to anyone without a base tan or people who don&#x27;t like tingle tanning lotions. This lotion will leave red spots on your skin for about 2 hours, so if you are going to be scantily clad and going out I wouldn&#x27;t use it. I usually use Sheer Wisdom, but I like to implement this in every other time to enhance my tan.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to other user reviews. I am highly pleased with it. I love the tingle feeling as well as how dark I got so easily. It felt like I was sitting on a heating pad when I was driving home from the gym. It felt so good! I highly recommend this to everyone. The scent is awesome as well.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive but very effective lotion.  If you like a lot of tingle, pass this one up!</li>
    <li> strong tingle but i haven&#x27;t gotten much darker.</li>
    <li> Some notes and warnings about using tingles for the first time. *Skip to my second paragraph if you already know all about them!* You should have a decent base tan before you start using them - if you don&#x27;t there is a high chance you may develop a sunburn. Cherry Bomb is what I would consider a starter tingle as it is effective but not as strong as most other tingles. For your first time use I suggest using a mix of 50/50 Cherry Bomb and another, tingle free lotion to see if you can handle it. What tingles do, and their purpose, is to raise blood levels towards the surface of your skin. This may sound odd but it is completely safe provided you are careful not to burn. The bright redness that is gives your skin surface (don&#x27;t panic!) makes it much more easy to increase the darkness of your skin in a short amount of time. Unless you over-due it and burn yourself, the redness will subside within 20 minute to 3-4 hours, typically. You will begin to see your tan once it subsides. Do NOT use this product, or ANY tingles on your face as you can develop broken capillaries, and possible rosacea. You do not want that! You may shower after using this product but beware it can re-activate and be painful. Use room temperature water or cold water if you can handle it - this will significantly lessen or completely eliminate the re-activation and subsequent pain. Alternate tingles with other lotions - try not to use them more than twice per week as you can easily develop a tolerance, thus becoming ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tingle does have a dark cherry scent. It doesn&#x27;t give off a strong sweet smell but rather a mild scent. After tanning, you should barely be able to smell it. Beware of mixing with other lotions with a strong scent as this can smell pretty nasty with the wrong combination. Like, oh god I&#x27;m going to puke style odor. If you don&#x27;t have a scentless lotion and you want to mix it with something, go for a mild fruity or chocolate scent for the minimal gross-factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started using this as soon as I developed my base tan. With my first use my skin was practically doubled in darkness! No orange at all. I felt only a mild tingle and a stronger heated feeling. I do not have particularly sensitive skin, if you do - use with caution. Mix it with something else if you&#x27;re unsure. If you are not cautious and have sensitive skin this can cause you a lot of pain and possible sunburn.</li>
    <li> This was my first tingle lotion. I&#x27;m an experienced tanner, but not like an all-the time tanner. I have naturally olive skin and tan easily. I put this on and hopped in the tanning bed. I didn&#x27;t know how intense it was gonna be so I just went for 10 minutes (I usually go 15 in a 20 min bed). I didn&#x27;t feel anything right away, but after maybe 2 minutes I started to feel a tingly burn in my arms. By the end of the session I didn&#x27;t feel the tingle anywhere else though! I did see that I was red when I got out though, but a tan-red not a lobster red. The redness lasted for about an hour or so. I tried the lotion a few days later, this time for 15 minutes. That time I *started* to feel it on my legs and tummy, but it still wasn&#x27;t intense. I don&#x27;t know, it seems like it does help me get a bit darker, it&#x27;s just not as intense as I thought it would be. Still a fun lotion and smells great though :)</li>
    <li> I have used sun beds for years and already had a good tan before using this product so I thought my skin would handle it quite well.. Boy, was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it gives you a good tan but I looked like a singed lobster when I first got off the sunbed and my skin was on fire for ages afterwards! My face looked ridiculous. I would only use this again if I wanted a good tan and fast!</li>
    <li> The cherry smell although pleasant at first lingers for 6-8 hours making the scent unbearable. Very little tan if any noticed.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how this lotion applies.  It is not greasy at all and my skin does not have that after tan smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to my tanning ritual.  It is a MUST have for the tanning enthusiast.  This lotion has an amazing scent with just the right amount of &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I have really fair skin, but I am able to use this when I tan and i tell a difference right away. It DOES tingle and itch, but thats the point. I am red for a little bit..and then after it turns to a bronze/brown color. Very excited.</li>
    <li> This is my first tingle lotion, and I&#x27;m not disappointed. At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because I didn&#x27;t feel anything, but now I know the tingle only kicks in when you get in the tanning bed. It&#x27;s not too hot for me. It kind of feels like mild pins and needles. But I&#x27;m not very sensitive to pain, so it might be too hot for someone else. I got darker after one session, so I&#x27;ll be using this once a week.</li>
    <li> great service and great lotion.</li>
