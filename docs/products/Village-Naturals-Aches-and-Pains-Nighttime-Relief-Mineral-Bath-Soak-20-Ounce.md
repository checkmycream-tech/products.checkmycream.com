<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This whole line is marvelous - can be used at the bottom of a shower, too, but far more effective in a nice hot bath. This one is restful, but the line includes ones for sinus issues and aches and pains - very good!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells really good. There&#x27;s no overbearing scent and it really did relax me. I used this after work one night and was sleeping within 20 minutes of stepping out of the tub. Maybe I was tired and didnt realize it, but I give the credit to the bath salts! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels good. Expensive though. Can find cheaper at Target.</li>
    <li> I love it love it!  I wish I could by many more jars.  I have a jacuzzi and it is absolutely perfect for it.  I like to use it right before I go to bed so that I can get a relaxing good nights sleep.</li>
    <li> These salts smell great, leave your skin smooth and soft, and help relax you after a long day.  I recommend them to anyone who loves a good bath at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I am an insomniac, and without fail, a hot bath with these lavender and chamomile-scented bath salts will put me to sleep. No, really. I don&#x27;t know what it is about these, because I have tried lavender solutions before, and nothing else has worked quite like these. Throw them in as you&#x27;re drawing your bath, and close the door to let the steam build up, and it&#x27;s like a spa. I also really like the aches and pain formula for back and shoulder pain.</li>
    <li> smelt nice but left a grey sludge behind</li>
    <li> Got these for my mother for Mother&#x27;s day and for some friends. Ladies love it and they&#x27;re actually quite useful for relieving stress and pains. Definitely a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 in May as a discontinued item at a grocery store with 50% off. I had NEVER seen it before at any of the regular h&amp;b stores, so I have never used it, but I had seen/used 3 others:     aches &amp; pains, colds&amp; allergy, stress &amp; tension.  Long story short, I finally got around to using Restless Nights on Monday, all I can see is heavenly --- the delightful understated scent lingers in the bathroom for hours after taking a bath.  Leaves me feeling relaxed, calm, softly scented all over as well skin feeling so soft.  I have used it daily.  Only have 1-3/4 jar left.   WIsh they would stock that item in the local stores in my area.    You can&#x27;t go wrong, check it out, your nose and overall body will thank you.    Enjoy!    Gladi D-S  Inland NW</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of the Restless Nights Bath Soak. I find it very soothing for ragged nerves after a long day of work. I have sensitive skin and it leaves it feeling soft and pampered.</li>
    <li> I can not wait to use this to just relax on a regular night. It arrived while im sick and has been great, but i have a feeling it smells really nice too!! I can&#x27;t wait to find out.</li>
    <li> Came in before the estimated shipment delivery. The product was sealed and handled with love. I love the aroma-therapy aspects, the scents aren&#x27;t too over bearing either and really do help with restless nights. We also use it for my niece who has cerebral palsy on some of her restless nights.</li>
    <li> This relaxes me so much. I love taking baths at night with a glass of wine and putting netflix on my laptop. I am normally not one for lavender but this is so great. Will definitely buy more of!!</li>
    <li> This product is not as good as the previous product called. ENGLISH LAVENDER BODY SOAK, 31 oz. The fragrance of RESTLESS NIGHTS BATH SOAK does not last after drying off. Where to find the first product mentioned?</li>
    <li> First, the smell of the salts makes me feel like I am at the spa. As soon as I step in the bath time, I felt relaxed and soothe. This product is definite try!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, affordable line of aromatherapy products for a luxurious &amp; relaxing experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This entire line is just wonderful.  The restless nights bath is a soothing  mix of lavender , chamomile, and passion flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recover from a  very stressful day with bath I, bath salts, or body wash.  After an aromatherapy bath like this, have a great night&#x27;s sleep-naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any of these make a terrific and very appreciated gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget going to a spa-recline in aromatherapy at home!</li>
    <li> Smells great, just wish the lid hadn&#x27;t broken in shipping and made the rest of my order smell like it. I was very disappointed since it was supposed to be a gift.</li>
    <li> I love these bath salts! The aromatic scent of lavendar is just the right strength while being very calming. I was worried about the salts leaving a slippery residue but I have yet to find any. I really enjoy the scent that wavers after the initial bath and fills my bathroom with the light flowery scent.</li>
    <li> I love nice long baths.  I&#x27;m not sure they help me sleep better, but they smell nice in my bath.  Plus they are a good value for the amount of salts in the jar.</li>
    <li> I take baths every single day and I suffer from anxiety, so this is amazing. The scent is VERY powerful and you will smell like it when you get out, but that&#x27;s a MAJOR PRO for me! For those of you who are sensitive to strong scents, just use less in the bath. It isn&#x27;t oily and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Just takes the senses on a relaxing journey :) Love it!</li>
    <li> I found these crystals at my local grocery store, and found them to be the BEST smelling,relaxing bath crystals I have every used! To my dismay, my store discontinued carrying that particular scent, so I was really happy to find them on Amazon. Just a handful of these crystals permeate the air with a wonderful smell, and create a very restful feeling! I&#x27;ve been telling all of my friends about them :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law and she loves it! I plan on buying more of this item (and other therapy bath soaks from this brand) in the future.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, she liked it very much and told me it makes for a very relaxing bath, well heck I deserve to relax to darn it  so I used it, well she was right! so I got more :)</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I use it in a tub of hot water when I can&#x27;t sleep and it really helps. I use it along with the one for aches &amp; pains because I have arthritis really bad as well as dystonia (a disease causing you to lose control of muscles &amp; makes my whole body spasm) which sometimes begins in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> First off, I bought this for myself. I train as an amateur boxer and do a lot of running, and often my muscles cramp up and heavy stretching is needed before I&#x27;m back at 100%. First and foremost I bought these salts to ease my muscle pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing a -hot- bath and getting in, first thing you notice is the heavy aroma. These salts smell great! And a large part of the \\&quot;restless nights\\&quot; label has to derive from the aromatherapy it provides. After a bath it left our bathroom smelling like lavender for at least 3 more days--can&#x27;t complain about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is the quantity that comes in this small package. The packaging recommends 1/3 cup for each bath, and that seems to do the trick (though most other bath salts seem to recommend 2 cups), but at the price you pay for this it&#x27;s just too much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll get a handful of baths at the most, and while some people might be all right with that, I just think it&#x27;s too much to pay for such a small amount of salt.</li>
    <li> My kids and I think this is awesome! It makes your skin feel soft,my kids asked me to feel there skin afterward because they where so soft.It is Relaxing and the smell is Awesome!! We are most definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> These baths salts smell really nice and make for a very relaxing soak. Though I have very sensitive skin, this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the instructions tell you to use a rather large amount of salts, you really don&#x27;t need that much to turn your bath water completely purple and fill up your whole bathroom with lavender scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to get this on sale when I bought it, so I can&#x27;t complain about the price too much. However, for a natural product that goes a long way, it&#x27;s not too bad!</li>
    <li> Having a hard time getting restful sleep? Get this, it works! The scent is so soothing and restful. I use it every other day and have been sleeping through the night.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Sleep is just around the corner after a good soaking.</li>
    <li> I live this companies salts. Have been using for quite a while and love then all</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff.  I buy her various scents of Village Naturals brand and she says it all smells great and feels like a spa visit.</li>
    <li> Smell was not pleasant.</li>
    <li> These bath salts are the BEST! They desolve quickliy and the aroma&#x27;a are amazing! I have tried many others and ALWAYS come back to these!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The village naturals therapy restless nights mineral bath soak works better in a tub rather than a hot tub.</li>
    <li> I love taking long hot baths at the end of the day.... this was perfect.. and had such a great lavender fragrance...</li>
    <li> Actually helps me get to sleep on the nights I am unable to fall right to sleep, smells great too.</li>
    <li> I am not in love with this fragrance. I adore Lavender, but this has an artificial lavender smell to it. It works well as a soak, but the fragrance is not my favorite.</li>
    <li> This product was very well packaged.  It was sent to me in a timely fashion &amp; I am really enjoying it.  Hope to buy again.</li>
    <li> My panacea for anything that may ail me, mental or physical, is a hot soak. Last night, I was a little achy and had trouble sleeping the night before. I turned on the tub, scattered 3 palm fulls of this salt into the water, and proceeded to have quiet a most relaxing soak. I got out 45 minutes later, feeling particularly mellow and ache free. The lavender scent is present, but in a moderate, enjoyable way (and I didn&#x27;t get out smelling like a perfumed harem). I have used Village Naturals Therapy salts before, just not this particular product - but &amp;#34;Restless Nights&amp;#34; will definitely be my go to salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Update-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact I have been regularly purchasing this bath salt once a month here on Amazon, every time arriving perfect.  Bath salts have always been one of those things that I CONSTANTLY forget while at the store, so the ability to buy directly here at the same cost, along with my Prime membership shipping,  is just fantastic.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone to use after a busy day - it has calming powers for me.</li>
    <li> Pleasant lavender scent, and not much is needed compared to other bath salts. If you notice any color on your tub after a bath, clean it off right away or it will leave stains that are very hard to remove.</li>
    <li> I never received this as part if my order nor did I receive a response upon questioning the missing item. Very disappointing as it was meant to be a gift.</li>
    <li> Gave set of three to my Daughter-in-law and she liked to soak in them....said they were great and smelled very nice</li>
    <li> I do like the product line in general, and especially the Aches &amp; Pains version which I found relaxing, tingly, and best of all that it had a great scent that even seemed to open my sinuses. This version simply smells like soap, not a pleasant smell, and definitely can&#x27;t smell lavender which is why my wife bought it for me. That is just two peoples opinion, both male and female - your opinion may vary.</li>
    <li> love these bath therapy soaks!</li>
    <li> I have tried every single on of Village Naturals bath salts, and I can say that I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;I do, of course, have my favorites, but the aromatherapy works for each type. This one was truly relaxing and helped my husband sleep better when he used it to help remedy his insomnia. Lovely scent.</li>
    <li> Smoked about half the bottle, awoke with a bit of a headache which was OK, but also had blood all over my hands and bits of flesh in my teeth.</li>
    <li> This one bath soak i&#x27;d put up with a good scented epsom salted bath for achy muscles or crampy legs. Hot baths are one affordable luxury I can have three times a week and look forward to soaking with this restless nights mineral bath.</li>
    <li> Love these! They are very relaxing, and are perfect for anyone that has difficulty going to sleep at night. These bath salts smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> The beads for this when it melts in the water makes you skin feel so soft.  It smell good and is very relaxing.  It is very soothing.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go to sleep without this in my bath last thing at night.  It works, and doesn&#x27;t take much.  Good value</li>
    <li> The combination of ingredients is well-suited to calm one before bed, or anytime stress creeps into life. Unlike other entries by Village Natural Therapy that lack either menthol or eucalyptus, this has the perfect infusion of juniper to calm (unlike their eponymous product) and it makes for an excellent addition to a bath.</li>
    <li> Conforming and good scent</li>
    <li> nice small. good enough for the price</li>
    <li> Lavender is my favourite scent and I love to take a bath with this along with Village Natural&#x27;s lavender bubble bath whenever i&#x27;ve had a hard day, and if It&#x27;s been really tough a nice lavender bath bomb is great too. Very happy with this purchase, it smells lovely and the beads dissolve quickly.</li>
    <li> When it comes to aroma, I am one of the pickiest person you can ever find. I don&#x27;t like almost all the floral or sweet smells. On the other hand, I wanted to buy a mineral bath soak very badly. So, I bought this salt with a high chance that it would end up in the trash can.  Good news to me that I am pleasantly surprised. I can&#x27;t comment on the relaxing aspect of it as a salt, but definitely its smell make me relax and feel good. I bought the second jar a few days ago. Different shades of the salt grain also offer a nice touch to my bathroom decoration. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Does a great job!  Nice scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasts me a while. Be warned, though, it will leave a ring on your tub.</li>
    <li> I bought based on other&#x27;s positive reviews and they were true; great salts that make the bath even more relaxing. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this for me just a few days ago, and I received it shortly, which was awesome! I used it last night and the first thing I noticed was the amazing smell! It is very relaxing, and great! I recommend this to everybody!</li>
    <li> Smells very potent so a small pinch in the bath tub goes a long way... I find a smell smoothing and relaxing, but if you dislike lavender, I recommend that you stay away from this product since it smells more lavender than camomile.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She said it smelled really nice and made a nice addition to her bath time.</li>
    <li> After several uses the it has proven to be a great product. Just a little bit of the minerals and the bathroom fills with the scent of lavender. It adds to the hot bathing experience and a bottle provides enough to last a number of baths.</li>
    <li> Worked so well! The lavender and hot water immediately relaxed my muscles and mind.  I was ready to sleep asap!</li>
    <li> Ever tossed and turned more than sleep? Ever find yourself still up hours later in a lay down session? Ever get really Pissed about that? Ever tossed and turned some more and maybe find yourself pulling your jerkin until you&#x27;re able to catch some true shut eye? If you answered yes to any of these then you might need some Village Naturals Therapy Restless Nights. This stuff will have you snoring in no time, possibly to a dream. I recommend 5 to 6 cap fulls and count sheep for the first 2 hours and bam you will be knocked the heck out Guaranteed. This stuff smells good and just makes you sleepy by smelling it. Do yourself a favor and if pulling your jerkins or counting sheep on it&#x27;s own doesn&#x27;t work well then you may need Restless Nights.</li>
    <li> This helps me when I have restless nights.  It helps me feel relaxed and ready for bedtime.  The lavender in oil really  help me feel tired and sleepy so when I get into bed I drift off to sleep.</li>
    <li> I did not see in the description that this product contained artificial fragrances. My wife is vary sensitive (skin) to fragrances. I purchased this for her for Easter and lucky she read the ingredients on the bottle before using it. She gets really bad rashes from artificial fragrances. The seller should list all ingredients on this site to prevent problems with customers.</li>
    <li> Seems to be an ok product.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from using it.  The way my nights are it would take a Gallon to help me :&#x3D;).&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice mild scent.  The salts dissolve quickly and you really can&#x27;t tell they were ever put in the water.  This was my 1st time trying bath salts so I am no expert.</li>
    <li> My mother often has trouble sleeping, especially when she has just returned home from water aerobics, and she says that this stuff really helps her to relax her tired muscles and sleep well.</li>
    <li> These salts dissolve just fine and are packed with fragrance. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t like the fragrance. I was hoping for something very natural and authentic smelling, these smell like perfume.</li>
    <li> Perfect and great price. I put it in a bunch of smaller boxes for gifts for lady friends.  It was perfect</li>
    <li> I like it, but the smell is a tad overwhelming with lavender.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a box that was a bit bigger than the container and i knew by the sound of the box it wasnt going to be a pleasant surprise opening it. The cap was busted and almost 1/2 the bath salts were in the box. I was so mad to have spent the money on 1/2 the product!! I filed a packaging claim and heard nothing, now im leaving this feedback, we&#x27;ll see if the company actually cares about customer service. I&#x27;m giving the product 1 star due to the fact i cant even use it but a few times before it will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: i just found out today that a local store sells this product for quite a bit less- thanks for the great service, i wont be back</li>
    <li> I bought this to give as a Christmas present &amp; ended up keeping it.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Smells so nice. Very relaxing.</li>
    <li> love it makes you very sleepy :)</li>
    <li> I can not get this product in my area It is good that  I can get it here. I not only use it in my bath I put it in a dish next to my bed. It is very relaxing</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife who at the time was 7 months pregnant and experiencing a lot of lower back pain which made it hard for her to get a good night’s sleep. She tried it the first night she got it before she went to bed.  The next morning she said she had the best night of sleep in a long time.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;Heres something a lot of folks may not know.&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium sulfate, which is the main ingredient in epsom salts, is the same thing used&lt;br /&gt;to prevent women from going into premature labor. ( the uterus is a muscle)&lt;br /&gt;It really works on relaxing those muscles!!</li>
    <li> Wifey loves these! I bought a 3 pack so she can enjoy baths.</li>
    <li> This has a clear, true lavender scent and isn&#x27;t oily. I use it in my jetted tub, since the product doesn&#x27;t bubble. It makes your skin silky, not greasy. The scent is real, not perfumy, and the only downside is you have to use quite a bit for a soaker tub since the scent isn;t very concentrated. It&#x27;s priced affordably, though. Nice product.</li>
    <li> Smells great, does the job, combined with the a bath &#x3D; a nice relaxing time. The jar was bigger than I thought too!</li>
    <li> i love this but not the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I&#x27;m already planning on buying more when this bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> This product is really great.  I would love to use it every night but I save it for especially stressful days.  The relaxing scent blends well with unscented bath oil to complete the experience of letting the day go away for a little while and relax you for a solid nights sleep.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent from this company! I love soaking in the tub with these salts. Very relaxing and smells great!</li>
    <li> Sitting in a bath is always soothing.  This scent envelopes you in a beautiful floral scent that makes you feel like your laying in a field of flowers.  Love It.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m out..... and now I&#x27;m sad. I didn&#x27;t think I would go through it so quick! I love the smell and the soft skin.</li>
    <li> I love these bath salts! They make you smell really good after bathing. They also make your skin super soft! The only complaint I have is that I wish they lasted a bit longer.. I bought these about a month ago and am almost out already. I take two baths a week.. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mother in law for Christmas and she loves them!  She is sleeping much better than before-I will purchase this again for her.</li>
    <li> Im a man who works very long hard  hours and when I come home i just need a beer but sometimes I smelI like a man who works all day in the city. I get many compliments after my bubble baths. I recommend finding a floating coozie for the beer</li>
    <li> These bath salts are just perfect for a relaxing bath time. Lightly scented. I recommend this for family or friends. Would make a very nice gift.</li>
    <li> I love baths and I love scents, and this scent is wonderful. Fairly expensive for how small the container is, but it does not require very much salt for each use.</li>
    <li> See my rating of the bubble bath above.  Same rating applies for both the soak and the bubble bath.  Thanks, for a fine product!</li>
    <li> Helps me relax at bath time.</li>
    <li> Worth buying for the relaxation and the soothing ness of the lavender but it just makes me feel relaxed. You feel a little tired when you get out but that&#x27;s just because of the hot bath  and your muscles are relaxed. But I didn&#x27;t get the sleepy calming feeling I wanted. If you want this for the sleepy calm feeling this isn&#x27;t what you should get.</li>
    <li> This has the best smell ever! I use it in my whirlpool tub because it dissolves nicely and doesn&#x27;t get into the filter/jets. It makes my skin soft. Seems to be gentle enough for my 3 year old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them, and I enjoyed them!  I wish they came in more colors and fragrances, i.e. a pink floral and a blue sea theme.  I would buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;However, for a gift, the bottle is not that attractive.  They shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;A good $ value.</li>
    <li> Puts my wife right to sleep after a soak and smelling it on her in bed helps me fall asleep quickly. I will be getting more just for that reason! Lol</li>
    <li> I have found these bath salts to be a wonderful aid for relaxing to help with a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> I love these bath salts! I have a pretty big bathtub, so I use about 1/4 cup of salts.. the instructions say 1/3 of a cap ful, which would be about a teaspoon.. yeeaahhhhh... I need more than that. Anyway... its a great product and I love it. It doesnt leave any icky residue on me and it smells nice and yummy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff.  A long soak in a warm tub with a bit of Village Naturals and it&#x27;s lights out!  Recently used it more regularly when I had sore muscles and it helped relieve the aches and pains.</li>
    <li> Good quality and smells great. Really helps to relax before going to sleep.</li>
    <li> This bath salt smells like vomit, I was shocked since its says lavender scented. I had it returned immediately</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to remarry her after I gave her this stuff ;) well she did really like it.</li>
    <li> Lavendar has a nice smell and I use it all the time. Prevents my feet from feeling tired. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not bad but no where near as great as the discontinued Masada Bath Salts in Lavendar.  Our main issue is the scent of fragrances / not natural lavendar.  Oh well onto the next brand trying to replace our old favorite.</li>
    <li> Work just like it said. The crystal are very small. Great smell, though does not last long. Generally, worth the price.</li>
    <li> LOVE LVOE LOVE the smell.</li>
    <li> I love using these in our Jetted tub, the aroma is so relaxing.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite bath salts. They smell wonderful, are the perfect texture and turn the bath pink. I wish they came in a large size. I mix them with cheaper brands so they last longer. I use bath salts almost every night now that I&#x27;m pregnant and they are great for keeping my skin soft and soothing sore legs.</li>
    <li> Great Product works well better than described Would recommend to purchase if your looking for a quality product.  Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I try all types of bath products, and this is my favorite so far.  Just love the fragrance which is a huge part of the appeal.  Really makes me look forward to a bath.  I also like the way my skin feels.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Bought this for Mom and she loves using them (bought 3 kinds).</li>
    <li> these smell amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> Used these crystals for a baby shower favor. They smelled great! Havent actually used them yet, though...</li>
    <li> Tried it the first night I got it. The aroma is amazing, and very relaxing. I can see buying many more in my future!&lt;br /&gt;Bott</li>
    <li> Bought this with a book as a pampering gift for a mommy to be. Great gift giving size and packaging!</li>
    <li> These bath salts were exactly what we were looking for.  For the money, they are 5 stars, but compared to some of the higher end salts, they are just slightly lesser quality and take a bit more work before they dissolve.  I don&#x27;t know if their slower dissolve speed is good or bad, but it was different than previous purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, and they are definitely relaxing.  My wife \\&quot;complains\\&quot; that they put her to sleep when she uses them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that they are a great deal and very good produce.</li>
    <li> Bought it for myself to calm the nerves. But after a while found out that my husband takes a bath every day and my jar gradually emptied. Very pleasant smell. Add not a lot of the powder into the water.</li>
    <li> These salts are fine and they might be just what some people are looking for, but they weren&#x27;t quite what I wanted. They dissolved well in the water, which is great, but the scent isn&#x27;t quite what I was wanting. It smells kind of perfume like to me and I was looking for more of that essential oils type of scent. I also didn&#x27;t feel myself relaxing with them like I have with other salts. I did finish the bottle and had grown to like the scent a little more by the end but ultimately I decided to try something different.</li>
