### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>This product is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Best ever.</li>
      <li>Makes my manicures nice, shiny, and beautiful!</li>
      <li>Use it twice a day, in the morning and evening, and my nails look great</li>
      <li>Happy with it.</li>
      <li>I agree the rubberized top is great!</li>
      <li>And as a top coat it leaves my nails shiny and beautiful!!</li>
      <li>a convenience it is to have nice nails while I am out and about - and on the go!</li>
      <li>It might not be as good as having each coat separately, but it is a two in one product.  </li>
      <li>Works good and doesn&#x27;t gunk up while using it.  </li>
      <li>Helped me save some of my cheaper polishes whose color I loved.</li>
      <li>It had arrived on time, and was packaged good.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite out there!</li>
      <li>So that might kind of be expected.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was awesome because i put it on first as a bottom coat and when my nail polish started chipping it didnt stain my nails and came off clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great clean polish, super shiny!</li>
      <li>The formula is easy to work with and it does leave a nice glassy finish, but my polish started to chip within 2 days.</li>
      <li>Love this and would recommend to anyone:)</li>
      <li>I love Orly, but this isn&#x27;t up to par....</li>
      <li>I used orly&#x27;s bonder basecoat (which also doesn&#x27;t work for me) and used this as a top coat.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s two in one.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get better than that</li>
      <li>I realize that it is supposed to be used as a bottom AND top coat</li>
      <li>Shiny, protects the nail as a bottom coat, and keeps color longer as a top coat.</li>
      <li>This top and bottom coat makes my nail polish stay on for up to two weeks.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Plus I love its handle for easy grip and anti-slip.</li>
      <li>After using it, I know that this is a fantastic top coat.  </li>
      <li>but I am very loyal to Orly&#x27;s Nailtrition as a bottom</li>
      <li>The formula goes on the nails easily and keeps nails feeling strong and somewhat shiny.  </li>
      <li>I stamp my nails with Konad products and have found that as top coat does not smudge or smear the clean lines that the stamp makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As stated in another review for not being a fast-drying polish it dries quick!</li>
      <li>The nail polish goes on so even and so smooth.</li>
      <li>I found it worked good and was surprised as I had not used this product before.  </li>
      <li>I would use it as a top coat &amp; then put seche vite or another top coat for that high shine that I like.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>As a top coat, you may need to reapply every few days, but that is the case for most top coats.</li>
      <li>Also makes the colors more vivid.</li>
      <li>I still love Orly&#x27;s nail colors though they are usually very pigmented, shiny and fast drying.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like it as a top coat because it doesn&#x27;t really make your nails very shiny.</li>
      <li>It is a really good base, and a good top coat.  </li>
      <li>Came to me in the mail super fast and makes my polish stay in for weeks without chipping.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about an extra bottom or top coat.</li>
      <li>But with Orly&#x27;s product they&#x27;re looking so healthy and white again!</li>
      <li>I actually found it to be better than some brands that have top and bottom coats in the same formula.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was just my nails until I tried another top coat and realized I&#x27;d been wasting my time with these Orly products for so long.</li>
      <li>It makes it so easy to remove the nail polish and it makes it last for two weeks on my nails.</li>
      <li>Also dries up really fast.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This dries so fast.  </li>
      <li>With a different top coat my nails last about 5 days.</li>
      <li>Seems to dry pretty fast for a &amp;#34;non-fast drying&amp;#34; polish!</li>
      <li>They need to put more effort into their top/bottom coats especially for how expensive they are in comparison to better ones.</li>
      <li>This base coat and top coat combo is amazing.</li>
      <li>Used this with Nail lacquers besides Orly and surprised to see they complement well.</li>
      <li>It really makes your manicure last longer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other base and top coats but this by far has to be my favorite!!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite top and base coat.</li>
      <li>Helps keep my nails feeling strong and looking less dry.</li>
      <li>If you wait for most of the product to dry before applying the stickies, and let some (very little) of the product remain tacky before you apply, it helps help the appliques adhere.  </li>
      <li>As a top coat it takes an unbelievable amount of time to dry.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in water, or working hard with my hands, I was also using it with salon quality color polish</li>
<li> As a base coat, it works very well.  </li>
<li> I was overall disappointed with how well this product maintained my manicure.</li>
<li> Tried this after the supermarket brands failed miserably.  </li>
<li> As a base coat it has helped me a lot.</li>

    <li> This top and bottom coat makes my nail polish stay on for up to two weeks. Can&#x27;t get better than that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months and after buying another brand I wish I would&#x27;ve switched sooner. To be fair I almost never used it as a base coat so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I used orly&#x27;s bonder basecoat (which also doesn&#x27;t work for me) and used this as a top coat. As a top coat it takes an unbelievable amount of time to dry. I would say hours to fully dry, and I never feel it&#x27;s fully dry. The gloss is so so and my nails start chipping the next day. I thought it was just my nails until I tried another top coat and realized I&#x27;d been wasting my time with these Orly products for so long. I still love Orly&#x27;s nail colors though they are usually very pigmented, shiny and fast drying. They need to put more effort into their top/bottom coats especially for how expensive they are in comparison to better ones.</li>

    <li> I was overall disappointed with how well this product maintained my manicure. I agree the rubberized top is great! The formula is easy to work with and it does leave a nice glassy finish, but my polish started to chip within 2 days. I tried reapplying daily which got me to about 5 days before I had to redo my nails. I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in water, or working hard with my hands, I was also using it with salon quality color polish so I expected it to last longer. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again and will go back to OPI start to finish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other base and top coats but this by far has to be my favorite!! As a base coat it has helped me a lot. I use red nail polish a lot and my nails were starting to get yellow with other base coats. But with Orly&#x27;s product they&#x27;re looking so healthy and white again! The nail polish goes on so even and so smooth. And as a top coat it leaves my nails shiny and beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s two in one. I don&#x27;t have to worry about an extra bottom or top coat. It&#x27;s great!</li>

    <li> Tried this after the supermarket brands failed miserably.  Works good and doesn&#x27;t gunk up while using it.  Happy with it.</li>
    <li> Feel as though this made my nails peel after removing with nail polish remover.  Do not recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this polish as a set.  After using it, I know that this is a fantastic top coat.  I realize that it is supposed to be used as a bottom AND top coat but I am very loyal to Orly&#x27;s Nailtrition as a bottom coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dries so fast.  I stamp my nails with Konad products and have found that as top coat does not smudge or smear the clean lines that the stamp makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last two years, I have been making a hobby of nails.  I wish I would have found this polish sooner!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! It&#x27;s a great clean polish, super shiny! Seems to dry pretty fast for a &amp;#34;non-fast drying&amp;#34; polish!</li>
    <li> Helps keep my nails feeling strong and looking less dry. Use it twice a day, in the morning and evening, and my nails look great</li>

    <li> After complaining to a friend about going for a manicure and after a few days the polish would chip off, she recommended this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my next visit with the manicurist, she applied the Top2 Bottom Basecoat and two weeks went by before the nail polish began to chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a convenience it is to have nice nails while I am out and about - and on the go!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite top and base coat. It had arrived on time, and was packaged good. No problems. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect.  I have used it for years and see no reason to every buy any other base or top coat.</li>
    <li> i use this product all the time.</li>
    <li> For a base and top coat combo this is my favorite out there! As stated in another review for not being a fast-drying polish it dries quick! Makes my manicures nice, shiny, and beautiful! Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Best ever. Shiny, protects the nail as a bottom coat, and keeps color longer as a top coat. Also makes the colors more vivid.</li>
    <li> Used this with Nail lacquers besides Orly and surprised to see they complement well. Also dries up really fast. Plus I love its handle for easy grip and anti-slip.</li>
