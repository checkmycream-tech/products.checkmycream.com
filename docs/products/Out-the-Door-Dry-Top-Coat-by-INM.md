      <li>Dries very fast and leaves an amazing shine.</li>
      <li>It does, smooth out the polish when applied.</li>
      <li>My current polish has been on a week and still looks great.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and never chips.</li>
      <li>First, let me tell you I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now, and have bought 5 more bottles.</li>
      <li>It dries instantly, goes on smooth and has a bright shine.  </li>
      <li>Then came home and searched it on Amazon and found all these great comments about this particular clear polish.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product to purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also is super glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this dries quickly and out the door you go</li>
      <li>This chips for me at the normal rate that most topcoats do.</li>
      <li>It drys fast and easy to put on.</li>
      <li>Best quick dry ever :) I seriously bow to it.</li>
      <li>True to word fast drying</li>
      <li>Drys super fast.</li>
      <li>It protects real well and dries QUICK.</li>
      <li>It dries nail polish (no matter how sticky) super fast</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted/expected.  </li>
      <li>sure what to tell you about chipping; the only thing that doesn&#x27;t chip for me is gel.</li>
      <li>Since finding this product, I never paint my nails without using &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; as a final top coat.  </li>
      <li>And it really seems to help prolong the life of the color!</li>
      <li>Keeps them from chipping fast, too!</li>

      <li>And it dries really fast.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t thicken up as fast as seche vite does either, so the bottle lasts longer.</li>
      <li>Dries so fast</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thinner and easier to cover, but dries just as fast as seche vite.</li>
      <li>It leaves your nails super shiny and they usually stay chip free for the whole week.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 20 years and highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>My nails always dry from 2-4mins with a lustrous shine that last for days :)</li>
      <li>(My new salon doesn&#x27;t have it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quick dry and makes the manicure shiny.</li>
      <li>Polish my toes and use this after my top coat and no more smudges.....</li>
      <li>what it smelled like, also it didnt give me the shine i was looking for, and it did not dry as fast as i thought,</li>
      <li>/&gt;It tries quickly and gives your names a professional gloss.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend applying it and going directly out the door, unless it is being applied to your toes.  </li>
      <li>, that now happen near the end of the week&#x27; s manicure; with other topcoats, I often began chipping the first day of the mani.</li>
      <li>It never dulls.</li>
      <li>It came on time, a little early actually, and it exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>If you want you nails look professional and get dry in seconds</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t get thick when i had the brush out for too long like some other top coats</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Terrific topcoat! Resists chipping and helps maintain my manicure through the week. Also, it shines shines shines!</li>
    <li> Works especially well with Zoya polishes as Seche Vite causes them to shrink &amp; crack.</li>
    <li> I found this one by accident.  Then came home and searched it on Amazon and found all these great comments about this particular clear polish.  Its a great name because you really can put on a coat on all fingers and within minutes you can pick up and head out to do what you need to without worrying about getting your nail polish damaged.  A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> My nail salon introduced me to this amazing topcoat, and  I appreciate the Amazon price. I  am hard on my manicures, and daily applications of this product give me almost one week with very few chips, that now happen near the end of the week&#x27; s manicure; with other topcoats, I often began chipping the first day of the mani.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. I&#x27;m usually doing my nails just before running &#x27;out the door&#x27;, so it&#x27;s a must not to have to worry about smudges at the last minute</li>
    <li> The best top coat that dries quickly that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Perfect for last minute nail polishing.</li>
    <li> Since finding this product, I never paint my nails without using &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; as a final top coat.  It drys my nails in minutes and there is no need to wait around before getting on with my day.  It goes on smooth and never chips. Great product!</li>
    <li> Received promptly.  Item was as described.</li>
    <li> It worked alright but definitely not the same formula that I remember using that would make your manicure last a week and then some</li>
    <li> First, let me tell you I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now, and have bought 5 more bottles. I am in love with this stuff. It protects real well and dries QUICK. I use this at work and I&#x27;m back to filing in 20 minutes with no smudges. It does shrink the polish just a tiny bit but the overall quality makes up for that.</li>
    <li> Been using this for decades. Dries very fast and leaves an amazing shine. Highly recommend. Great for nighttime manicures before bed.  No morning sheet marks</li>
    <li> Good sheen, dries quickly.  None of the nasty cheapo filler ingredients you get in some polish.  Perfect.  Exactly what I wanted/expected.  My grandmother has been a fan of this for years!</li>
    <li> This top coat it the best one ever, I just got in the mail and I tried and it dries in seconds it s amazing!</li>
    <li> This is an okay top coat. It does, smooth out the polish when applied. It does have a fast drying time, however it doesn&#x27;t necessarily dry in &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; and my polish was still chipped in 3 days or less.</li>
    <li> My favorite top coat! I&#x27;ve tried many and all were fine but this one takes the cake! Dries super fast &amp; leaves my nails shiny &amp; beautiful. Keeps them from chipping fast, too!</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Within 10 minutes I&#x27;m able to get up and do minor things.  The Murphy&#x27;s law about having to go to the bathroom with wet nails is gone.  As long as you wait 10-15 mins and are careful you won&#x27;t have a problem with even that.</li>
    <li> This top coat is excellent and resists chipping well and preserves the underlying nail color well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is super glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This in my opinion, is a great top coat.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! Dries so fast and it still looks wet. Great shine and it lasts for weeks!</li>
    <li> fast delivery great product would buy again. had sister buy some to try. this dries quickly and out the door you go</li>
    <li> I love it ! It arrived no later than 3 days</li>
    <li> This doesnt dry quicky as compared to others ive used</li>
    <li> Best. Topcoat. Ever. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 20 years and highly recommend it.  It dries instantly, goes on smooth and has a bright shine.  It never dulls.</li>
    <li> I used to always use seche vite, but this stuff is way better. It&#x27;s thinner and easier to cover, but dries just as fast as seche vite. It doesn&#x27;t thicken up as fast as seche vite does either, so the bottle lasts longer. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Finally, I can do my nails in the evening and NOT wake up with sheet marks on my nails.  I was skeptical but so glad I bought this....</li>
    <li> So i tried this and was not impressed, it seemed as though i was putting remover on top of my polish, at least thats what it smelled like, also it didnt give me the shine i was looking for, and it did not dry as fast as i thought, could just be me though, maybe im missing something...eh, oh well. Will order seche vite next time!</li>
    <li> True to word fast drying</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s awesome and it dries fast and it&#x27;s shiny and mine didn&#x27;t get thick when i had the brush out for too long like some other top coats</li>
    <li> Must have for Fast drying.. should still use  caution to not bump...over all the best  top coat for  reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years..  Polish my toes and use this after my top coat and no more smudges.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tries quickly and gives your names a professional gloss.</li>
    <li> Just like in the salon!</li>
    <li> Really dries fast, great shine!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using out the door for many years now and I like it.  I don&#x27;t recommend applying it and going directly out the door, unless it is being applied to your toes.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good product to purchase.</li>
    <li> Love out the door. Drys super fast.</li>
    <li> It actually does what it boosts.... it dries your nails in record time and you can actually go Out the Door almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I keep buying this top coat over and over again. It is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I do my nails weekly. It leaves your nails super shiny and they usually stay chip free for the whole week. I will continue to buy this till they stop making it (and I pray that never happens because I  love this stuff!!!)</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of top coats. Seche Vite caused my nail polish to peel off within a day or two, it was horrible. Essie no chip topcoat wasn&#x27;t much better. This one makes my nails GLOSSY and gorgeous. And it really seems to help prolong the life of the color!</li>
    <li> I NEVER finish a manicure without using one coat of this. It&#x27;s the best of its kind out there and it looks great. My manicures end up growing out at the nail bed before they chip. And it dries really fast.</li>
    <li> My color nails last longer!</li>
    <li> Pretty good top coat. Comparable to seche vite - it&#x27;s quick dry and makes the manicure shiny. I think the formula is safer than seche too</li>
    <li> Although I have not used this product yet, I know it works well because my nail salon uses it on me whenever I get my pedicures and manicures. I decided that I wanted a bottle of my own, so now I have one!</li>
    <li> This stuff dries insanely fast, gives a beautiful shine to my nails and DOESN&#x27;T SHRINK THE POLISH UNDER IT. That&#x27;s been my only complaint with other super fast-drying topcoats and this one takes the cake since it doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to tell you about chipping; the only thing that doesn&#x27;t chip for me is gel. This chips for me at the normal rate that most topcoats do.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It dries nail polish (no matter how sticky) super fast and it doesn&#x27;t chip!  My current polish has been on a week and still looks great.</li>
    <li> Best product of its kind. It&#x27;s everything it says it is. Put it on and out the door instantly. You&#x27;re gonna love it girls.</li>
    <li> Great. Does what it claims and gives a beautiful shine</li>
    <li> Best quick dry ever :) I seriously bow to it. Been using it for years and best thus far. The name says it all Literaly out the door. My nails always dry from 2-4mins with a lustrous shine that last for days :)</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I bought it at cvs before and it was more expensive. If you want you nails look professional and get dry in seconds this is the product!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Will only buy this brand!!!!</li>
    <li> Great top coat that really lasts and protects your nail color.</li>
    <li> This is one of my fave top coats and it lives up to it&#x27;s name. You can polish and apply and be out the door in seconds. I&#x27;ve had a bottle for ages and still not done. Very good value.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly but nail polish still soft for awhile after so you need to still be aware to not smudge.</li>
    <li> It came on time, a little early actually, and it exactly what I was looking for.  It dries very quickly and is nice and glossy, great product!</li>
    <li> I have been doing my nails for years and this is the best top coat I have ever used. It drys fast and easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this stuff!!! I used it at my nail salon &amp; 5 min under the fan.... I was able to put shoes &amp; socks on without any smudges or chips!! Can&#x27;t wait to get it.... (My new salon doesn&#x27;t have it &amp; I LOATHE SITTING UNDER THE DRYER for what feels like hours!!!</li>
