      <li>I love The Manipulator!</li>
      <li>You will notice softer and more pliable (yes!)</li>
      <li>I love Entwine!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>but I just cannot keep up with this kind of price.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not a lot of gunky buildup which is also nice.</li>
      <li>But honestly I don&#x27;t think it will work if your hair is relaxed and please notice that it is not even advertised for that kind of hair.</li>
      <li>but I honestly like it better by itself.</li>
      <li>1 hour later i had a awesome twist-out!!  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I just love my purchase</li>
      <li>I love this stuff esp for my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure it would take me a while to use this jar.</li>
      <li>Plan on ordering more from this line, soon.</li>
      <li>Love that.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure you could find another product that works just as well.  </li>
      <li>I received this product and enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>I use this in conjunction with On the Edge and love the results it gives me.</li>
      <li>The curl elongation thing does happen for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this product and so does my hair.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Will probably purchase at a show in the future to save on cost, but the styler works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but this stuff is my favorite product to use for twist-outs,</li>
      <li>I thought, ok.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>The best flat twist out I&#x27;ve ever had was because of the manipulator!</li>
      <li>I get great shine, definition that lasts, and no hard or flakey hair.</li>
      <li>but it has mineral oil which doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, my hair eats oil like i breathe air so that particular creme works perfect if i don&#x27;t use too much</li>
      <li>The results however was great, this is my favourite styling product by far</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, it does exactly what the product says it will do.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best product for twist and bantu knot outs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure It will get better throughout the day, as the day went by, my hair got kinkier and kinkier, and let me mind you that I have the most fine soft curly baby hair you can think of.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I used it on top of my freshly washed and moisturized hair, then I braided my hair.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy this product and I will continue to purchase it from time to time.</li>
      <li>IT IS TRUE ...</li>
      <li>It worked on my hair in conjunction with the other products,  my natural hair styles were flawless.</li>
      <li>After completely drying, I took the braids down and was really impressed with the SOFTNESS and CURL DEFINITION.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>I used the jelle styler on my first straw set!</li>
      <li>It really elongates the hair and gives it a smooth, salon-quality finish.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and left my hair feeling moisturized for 5 days without reapplying product</li>
      <li>It works great on twist outs or just plain styling.  </li>
      <li>Thrashed it right away.</li>
      <li>This will be the first time I returned a hair product, this isn&#x27;t worth keeping.</li>
      <li>Seller ships super fast.</li>
      <li>and it last for more than a week.</li>
      <li>This thing works exactly as described on curly hair that is not relaxed at all.</li>
      <li>I like the butter cream better in my hair, I only ordered it once just to give it a try, but I don&#x27;t think I will order this again.</li>
      <li>so u might want to put some moisture creme on first</li>
      <li>I tried this product for the first time about a week ago.  </li>
      <li>the moisturizer first then manipulator did 2 strand twist</li>
      <li>The definition was great but the stretch it gave my hair was unbelievable, I like my hair big and fluffy but this product gave me great lengths.</li>
      <li>My curls are soft and full of body.</li>
      <li>With this product a little of this goes a long way- that is absolutely true and good because this is a bit pricey.</li>
      <li>Entwine products work very well on my hair.</li>
      <li>was really fast put it in my hair</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my hair texture or what, but I really didn&#x27;t like this in my hair..</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews I really had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>The product works exactly as the advertisement said it would, making my hair soft with lots of curl definition.  </li>
      <li>20 bucks for only 4 oz is not my idea of affordable when you have a full head of hair like mine-</li>
      <li>i used it more than once in effort to see if i was using too much or too little of it.</li>
      <li>I love this product, the only draw back for me was the price.</li>
      <li>i was bored and dyed my hair a golden reddish blonde color beautiful color</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend. ...</li>
      <li>The price is kinda high</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and i dap it on if i start with a little then add more if needed.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and the package came professionally packaged and wrapped.</li>
      <li>It really keep my curl in my hair it soft.</li>
      <li>I really like this for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>This is the first product that I have tried that did not dry my hair out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love The Manipulator! I use this to twist my hair at night. When I undo my twists the next morning I have bouncy and defined curls. There&#x27;s not a lot of gunky buildup which is also nice.</li>
    <li> Entwine products work very well on my hair. This jelle styler helps me to get a beautiful twist out in minutes.</li>
    <li> i am growing out my hair with and oath to never relax again it is about 4\\&quot; of new growth with 1\\&quot; of relaxer left also one day i was bored and dyed my hair a golden reddish blonde color beautiful color but i misread the instructions and left it in 20 min too long so now my hair was really dry frustrated i was going to cut it all off but i found this product along with the other 2 in jars they have a special on their website shipping was really fast put it in my hair the moisturizer first then manipulator did 2 strand twist it made my hair softer than it has been in a long time in it&#x27;s natural state and that is saying alot this a product line i will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product is the entire bomb.com! This is my creamy crack because I&#x27;m truly addicted! It does what it says its going to do! Curl definition and elongation. Hydrating and Mositurizing! These are hallmarks of an excellent product. I love Entwine!</li>
    <li> I received this product and enjoyed it. I don&#x27;t have super thick hair so I try not to use a lot. It leaves my hair with a shine on it. Love that. I would order again but I&#x27;m sure it would take me a while to use this jar. I ordered the 4oz and the company must not have had any in stock so I received the 8oz!!!! Happy customer</li>
    <li> Stinky product and make my hair feel metallic. Thrashed it right away. Worst money I have ever spent.</li>
    <li> Just purchased the styler and love it!! did a twist-out with the styler and 1 hour later i had a awesome twist-out!!  i paired it with the hydration cream and my hair came out soft for days.. a little goes a long way..i will defiantly be purchasing this product again and again.</li>
    <li> Product holds style perfectly!  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> The best flat twist out I&#x27;ve ever had was because of the manipulator! The only reason I gave four stars is because the product is a bit costly for my heavy hand/thick hair combo. Will probably purchase at a show in the future to save on cost, but the styler works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product on my African american 4b hair no dryness or flaking good hold.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with On the Edge and love the results it gives me. Definitely give it a try. It works great for my 4c/d type hair.</li>
    <li> I have 4b hair and it defines it and stays that way for days! Buy it, naturalistas! Buy this! Do it now!</li>
    <li> In order to get good results you must purchase the hydration, jelle styler, and aragon oil. I use it for my twist outs and it this product gives my curls great definition. My curls are soft and full of body.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my hair texture or what, but I really didn&#x27;t like this in my hair.. made it feel a bit dry and too crunchy - curly looking. I like the butter cream better in my hair, I only ordered it once just to give it a try, but I don&#x27;t think I will order this again.</li>
    <li> This creme works well, but I think my cantu shea daily moisturizer works just as well for half the price.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best product for twist and bantu knot outs. This is a staple in my natural hair regimen. Good for those transitioning also. Seller ships super fast.</li>
    <li> I used the jelle styler on my first straw set! I used it along with a setting lotion. It worked great for curl definition and hold! A little goes a long way!  My style lasted 7 days! I will definitely buy again! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> It worked on my hair in conjunction with the other products,  my natural hair styles were flawless. Would highly recommend. ...</li>
    <li> terrible products for my hair.  my hair was dry and brittle by the end of the day.  i prefer continuous moisture for my hair</li>
    <li> Great shine, and hold without the crunch! It smells nice and left my hair feeling moisturized for 5 days without reapplying product</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but this stuff is my favorite product to use for twist-outs, hands-down!  I get great shine, definition that lasts, and no hard or flakey hair.</li>
    <li> My 4c hair didnt respond to this creme. I will not re buy.</li>
    <li> This thing works exactly as described on curly hair that is not relaxed at all. I read a review of someone complaining that this didn&#x27;t work. But honestly I don&#x27;t think it will work if your hair is relaxed and please notice that it is not even advertised for that kind of hair. I don&#x27;t do anything like twist outs or braids, I just put on some leave-in or creamy conditioner on my hair and leave it alone. With this product a little of this goes a long way- that is absolutely true and good because this is a bit pricey. 20 bucks for only 4 oz is not my idea of affordable when you have a full head of hair like mine- lol - anyway, you can help it: retire the excess water from your hair, and do some prepping with your fave leave- in product. Then divide your hair in sections and apply like a quarter (if you still have less than shoulder long hair) to each section, massage it and com thoroughly. You will notice softer and more pliable (yes!) hair. Then do whatever you want. I just re-comb with my fingers and let it be, but when I got this, I took 2 tiny sections and tested it: I applied it to a damp -not dripping wet- one and to a dry one and curled them tight with my fingers with elongation motions and let them air dry. The curl elongation thing does happen for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Plan on ordering more from this line, soon.</li>
    <li> This creme is awesome. I love it. I&#x27;m definitely a fan.&lt;br /&gt;My hair loves it.  I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> EVERTHING U HEARD ABOUT IT IS TRUE ... JUST A LITTLE GO A LONG WAY ... VERY PRICEY AND I WOULD GET IT AGAIN WISH IT WAS MORE FOR THE PRICE !!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I really had high hopes for this product. Needless to say I was really disappointed with the results. This product really dried out my hair and I had no shine at all.</li>
    <li> I love it. It really keep my curl in my hair it soft. I just love my purchase thank you entwine.</li>
    <li> This line of products makes my hair so curly and fluffy I love it!  I might have a used a little too much of the product because I got a little build up after a couple days so it seems a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I normally do not write a review, but I had to say something about this product. This is the worst hair product I have ever used in my hair. So I bought the crème jelly styler and the exotique butter-crème hydrator. I washed and condition my hair and applied both as they recommended. I twisted my hair with the flex rods and went to sleep. The next day, I took of the flex rods, and my hair just felt so dense, heavy and un-manageable.  I thought, ok. I&#x27;m sure It will get better throughout the day, as the day went by, my hair got kinkier and kinkier, and let me mind you that I have the most fine soft curly baby hair you can think of.  I have never seen my hair is such of bad, unmanageable, wild,state ever in my life. The next I couldn&#x27;t even comb it; I had to wash it gently with conditioner, untangling the knots that left on my hair. This will be the first time I returned a hair product, this isn&#x27;t worth keeping.</li>
    <li> After reading and watching all the rave reviews about this product on youtube and instagram i decided to give it a try. The shipping was fast and the package came professionally packaged and wrapped. The size of the container was kinda small in my opinion, but I will say my twist and braid outs were very defined, the product did not leave my hair crunchy or left any residue. The price is kinda high but what natural hair product isn&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> I usually swear by Miss Jessie&#x27;s even with the mineral oil in some of her products cuz other products just  don&#x27;t work for me. But i decided to try this cuz it&#x27;s supposedly all natural. Compared to Miss Jessie it doesn&#x27;t make my hair any softer but that&#x27;s a plus cuz Miss Jessie makes my hair softer. As far as the curl definition it&#x27;s amazing and it last for more than a week. The elongation gives me about an inch longer but i guess it depends on your hair type. I have 4a with some 4c hair type that is extremely coily(like the spring in a pen) with an S pattern but very frizzy, tiny curls and extreme shrinkage so i cant do wash n go i have to twist my hair. I dont like the smell of this product, if u have a sensitive nose it will be annoying but its worth it cuz once u put a scarf on the scent is barely there and once your hair dries the scent is gone. The product is a little sticky but not as heavy as Miss Jessie but it last longer so your curls keep the definition longer. U don&#x27;t need a lot but i use the product from root to ends and i dap it on if i start with a little then add more if needed.  If you have short hair with alot of shrinkage this is the product for you cuz shorter doesn&#x27;t take well to curl definition, this doesn&#x27;t moisture your hair so u might want to put some moisture creme on first I like Miss Jessie&#x27;s buttercreme but it has mineral oil which doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, my hair eats oil like i breathe air so that particular creme works perfect if i don&#x27;t use too much</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way so dab just a pinky tip on your edges to help smooth out twist outs.  It&#x27;s about $20 for 4 ounces which is outrageous and I&#x27;m sure you could find another product that works just as well.  I like it but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again without a gift card.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff esp for my daughters hair. It keeps it mositurized. I paired it with the butter creme but I honestly like it better by itself. The butter creme is defiantly over rated. Will I buy it again ...probably not I can get the same moisture for a cheaper price. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it is good but price and shipping issues put an ill taste in my mouth.</li>
    <li> This product is good.  If you are protein-sensitive, be advised.</li>
    <li> USE wisely. THIS IS GOOD STUFF. but use it wisely it&#x27;s pricey as hell!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it does exactly what the product says it will do. I applied to my hair for a twist out. The definition was great but the stretch it gave my hair was unbelievable, I like my hair big and fluffy but this product gave me great lengths. I would definitely recommend this product if you want length to your hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time about a week ago.  I love that the consistency is creamy, but I was a little hesitant because it is also a little gooey.  Nevertheless, I used it on top of my freshly washed and moisturized hair, then I braided my hair.  After completely drying, I took the braids down and was really impressed with the SOFTNESS and CURL DEFINITION.  It really elongates the hair and gives it a smooth, salon-quality finish.  I was very pleased with the results and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturized cream syler!  The product works exactly as the advertisement said it would, making my hair soft with lots of curl definition.  The shipping was expeditious (before the scheduled ship date) and came in excellent condition.  I would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I am so thankful I took a chance and purchased these products. This is the staple twist out product for 4C hair! Get it, got it, good!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product and I will continue to purchase it from time to time. It does make my twists look longer.</li>
    <li> This is the first product that I have tried that did not dry my hair out.  It works great on twist outs or just plain styling.  I would recommend this product to anyone with natural hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it to twist my natural hair and it holds my twist and moisturize my hair. If you have natural hair this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the only draw back for me was the price. I have waiste length 4a/b hair and i only got 3 uses from this bottle to do  twist outs. The results however was great, this is my favourite styling product by far but I just cannot keep up with this kind of price.</li>
    <li> i bought this product about 4 months ago and i hated it. i used it more than once in effort to see if i was using too much or too little of it. i dosent work any better than any other product i have used and paid less for. save your 16.99 definitely will not be buying any of there products.</li>
    <li> I really like this for my natural hair. This jelle styler doesn&#x27;t clump up on my hair like stylers in the past, and the only complaint I have is because it is white, it does show up if you use alot.  Aside from that, I will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I love this product and so does my hair. Would recommend this product to anyone with low-porosity, 4C hair like mine.</li>
    <li> This makes my twists look new. All I have to do it wash my hair and apply the jelle styler. It also is great to manipulate the every piece of hair to stay where you want it to be.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome for twist outs, braid outs, and Bantu knots. Highly recommend.</li>
