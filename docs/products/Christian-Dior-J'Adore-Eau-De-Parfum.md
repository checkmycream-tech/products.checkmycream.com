      <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>i love fragrance</li>
      <li>This is one of Mom&#x27;s favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>My daugther love this parfum.</li>
      <li>I have had so many complements on it that I feel that I was worth it, ha ha!!  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent, and I was so happy Amazon could get it to me quickly when I was just about out and getting ready for a cruise.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful when first putting it on, but within 30-45 minutes it completely dissipates.</li>
      <li>, the bottle itself has a nice weight to it however the cap is plastic and has golden paint on it instead of what the advertisements say that it is hand jeweled however I believe these must be the mass produced versions of the product for the commoner</li>
      <li>I have the original and there are so many differences...  </li>
      <li>an it was so easy to order also......</li>
      <li>well...it smells like one of those excessively strong colognes in magazines.</li>
      <li>she&#x27;s super picky, this is her favorite.</li>
      <li>this is my very favorite scent ever, a classic fragrance that will never go out of style.</li>
      <li>but I found it U$S 30 cheapper in the dutty free of Lan Airlines.</li>
      <li>This size was such a great value I just couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
      <li>I love Jadore parfum and consider it my signature fragrance, but this bottle just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
      <li>The product is original</li>
      <li>perfume smells great and lasts long</li>
      <li>&amp; if its an original bottle it wont have the name on it.</li>
      <li>My wife has used other good perfumes like Issey Miyake, but she likes this the most.</li>
      <li>Stay away and buy it from a true department store.  </li>
      <li>my wife loves the scent, not to sweet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We just bought another bottle while in Paris, and we&#x27;re much happier with that one, even though it cost a lot more.</li>
      <li>Super upset about this.  </li>
      <li>However, I did make very sure it was being sold directly by Amazon, and that the description matched exactly what I was wanting to buy.  </li>
      <li>I am displeased with the product, but will remain a loyal amazon customer.</li>
      <li>I even picked the most recent year, though I paid more, because I wanted a quality product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a nice and clean scent.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy it when we get intimate.</li>
      <li>, so make sure you pay careful attention on this purchase :)</li>
      <li>Either a knockoff, or just not quite what I liked in actual use.</li>
      <li>It has such a sexy smell.</li>
      <li>Definitely one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>I have wanted to try this fragrance since it was first introduced but</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell - but what I do know is that it doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes on me...</li>
      <li>the top of the bottle where you spray the perfume from looks different than the bottle my wife just finished.</li>
      <li>The bottle looks good and smells the same, but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
      <li>just want to say for anyone else thinking about it, that the one I received is authentic, smells exactly like the one I am replacing, and lasts just as long.  </li>
      <li>very cheap but get battered in the box, completely crushed.</li>
      <li>the smell is good but not as hard as others on clothing or skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife straight from Amazon</li>
      <li>So I didn&#x27;t see what I really got for her.</li>
      <li>OMG...I agree with most of these other reviews.  </li>
      <li>The color of perfume in the bottle is different from the original.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last like the original product.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance was missing that special something that makes this fragrance unique.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this as long as available.</li>
      <li>This is a very soft cologne that I enjoy wearing all year long.</li>
      <li>but I felt it was too expensive to buy, then I found it on amazon and got a great deal</li>
      <li>The perfume smells great although it&#x27;s quite faint.  </li>
      <li>what a fliipin expensive lesson in trusting that I&#x27;d get an authentic product from Amazon!!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t live up to the in store sample</li>
      <li>Very Very soft sent.</li>
      <li>The first time I sprayed it, I thought it smelled different.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It has become one of my wife&#x27;s favorites.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife straight from Amazon and I think it&#x27;s great. My wife has used other good perfumes like Issey Miyake, but she likes this the most. And I agree. It has such a sexy smell. A great buy, I think.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE&#x27;S FAVORITE SCENT IN A VERY ATTRACTIVE BOTTLE.</li>
    <li> For the wife....how she smells really good...and I am the hero.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try this fragrance since it was first introduced but felt it was a little out of my price range!!  I ordered it from fragrance.com through Amazon and saved almost thirty dollars!  I have had so many complements on it that I feel that I was worth it, ha ha!!  When this bottle is almost done I will re-order!!</li>
    <li> The product is original but I found it U$S 30 cheapper in the dutty free of Lan Airlines. Just a matter of price.</li>
    <li> NOT AUTHENTIC!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware.  I have worn J&#x27;Adore Eau De Parfum Spray for 9 years.  The first time I sprayed it, I thought it smelled different.  The second time I sprayed it my unobservant family noticed it smelled different - unsolicited.  I am so disappointed because I have had such wonderful experiences ordering from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Like it. Got many compliments from women and men.I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Scent. But its pricey as expected. It doesnt seem to last as long as i thought for such an expensive perfume</li>
    <li> I have yet to have any luck with Cologne or perfume from amazon, I think I am 0 for 4 or 5 now. The daily scent just dose not last as long from the store for some reason.</li>
    <li> I got it as a gift for my sister and I send it directly to her. So I didn&#x27;t see what I really got for her. After more than six months, now I realized it was fake, so disappointing.</li>
    <li> my dauhgter&#x27;s favorite cologne</li>
    <li> I tried this perfume before and I loved it but I felt it was too expensive to buy, then I found it on amazon and got a great deal so I had to have it!</li>
    <li> Is coming like, used...</li>
    <li> It smells the same but it doesn&#x27;t last like the original product.  I believe it&#x27;s fake.  The bottle looks good and smells the same, but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent, and I was so happy Amazon could get it to me quickly when I was just about out and getting ready for a cruise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 and finding a scent that isn&#x27;t to young or old is rough. This is perfect for me to wear to work or out on a date night. I love it.</li>
    <li> Ive worked for christian dior &amp; all i have to say is that dont buy it on line. Youre paying more on here than you would at a department store. &amp; if its an original bottle it wont have the name on it. If its a tester bottle it will have J&#x27;adore on it in gold. Lastly this fragrance shouldnt wear off. i wear this all the time and i can smell it on my clothes for days &amp; if you spray it on your neck, wrist &amp; chest area the smell will last.</li>
    <li> this is my very favorite scent ever, a classic fragrance that will never go out of style. love love love</li>
    <li> the price is a little too high, but the wife likes it</li>
    <li> My wife just loved the J&#x27;adore and I like the way it smells as well not much else to say about it</li>
    <li> Came through perfectly and smells lovely. My husband and others have commented on how nice this fragrance smells.  The packing was perfect.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!! It&#x27;s such a nice and clean scent. I get compliments all the time and it lasts! Even when I can&#x27;t seem to smell it anymore, people still compliment me on my fragrance. Definitely one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> To be fair I did not buy this for myself.  It is a gift for my BF&#x27;s mom.  At least she smells a little better than cigarette smoke from her constant chain smoking.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff. Just make sure you like it before buying, go to your mall and try some out then come online and snag it for cheap!</li>
    <li> Of the Dior fragrances I&#x27;ve tried, this is my pick for daily wear. It is a clean blend of pear sparkling cider and heady florals on me and lacks the insane sillage and heaviness other Dior scents have.</li>
    <li> I suspect this is fake ... the top of the bottle where you spray the perfume from looks different than the bottle my wife just finished. The scent is right, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long. If not fake, it&#x27;s of &#x27;second&#x27; quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just bought another bottle while in Paris, and we&#x27;re much happier with that one, even though it cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. My ex husband liked this one also. Product as described.</li>
    <li> She loves the gift. I found t in a very good price and they deliver it very fast. it keeps the smell all they long</li>
    <li> Will always buy this from you!!!  My favorite perfume, will never have to go to Macy&#x27;s and pay their price again!!!!</li>
    <li> The best Eau De Parfum I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!!</li>
    <li> as always, wife loved it</li>
    <li> very cheap but get battered in the box, completely crushed. the smell is good but not as hard as others on clothing or skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Buy From this Vendor! The product is fake and you can&#x27;t return it</li>
    <li> It is not original and the package and bottle are lot&#x27;s different number&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel cheated by the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the help of Amazon with the solution of the problem but the seller is lousy and your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought the one in the store before, but ordered this, since it seems a better deal. However, it was not the same and I felt ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, if they carry the same name, it should smell the same.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st time I buy this perfume for my wife. I have been buying her Poeme by Lancôme for the past 9yrs. My wife loves this perfume and loves the smell and it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell - but what I do know is that it doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes on me...Disappointed as I love the fragrance which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought for a freind. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Stay away and buy it from a true department store.  Super upset about this.  Do not purchase.  I have the original and there are so many differences...  This is a knock off...</li>
    <li> I have used Jadore for over a decade. The imposters can be hard to spot because they look almost identical, so I went with Amazon as a seller because I trusted them. I even picked the most recent year, though I paid more, because I wanted a quality product. Sadly, I was disappointed. The fragrance was missing that special something that makes this fragrance unique. Additionally, it wears off in less than an hour and does not linger on clothing. Though it is unreturnable (due to amazon&#x27;s fragrance policy), I contacted customer service and was given a full refund without a hassle. I am displeased with the product, but will remain a loyal amazon customer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product s and excellent seller.</li>
    <li> Spectacular perfume; my wife loves it and I love when she wears it; She gets many compliments when she wears it. Will always be a desirable perfume;</li>
    <li> This is one of Mom&#x27;s favorite fragrances. along with four others.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34; for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Very Very soft sent. And not overpowering. Very lovely. Received lots of complements  Never any negative comments. I am very pleased with this parfum spray. I will continue to buy this as long as available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing J&#x27;adore for years so I knew when I spayed it on it was fake and the after scent will make you want to cough!! what a fliipin expensive lesson in trusting that I&#x27;d get an authentic product from Amazon!! NEVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I was on the fence on ordering this after reading reviews of customers claiming they received counterfeits.&lt;br /&gt;I just want to say for anyone else thinking about it, that the one I received is authentic, smells exactly like the one I am replacing, and lasts just as long.  (I sprayed one on each arm to compare throughout the day).  However, I did make very sure it was being sold directly by Amazon, and that the description matched exactly what I was wanting to buy.  I had come across j&#x27;adore listings that once clicked upon became some sort of &#x27;Hearts &amp; Daggers&#x27; listing, so make sure you pay careful attention on this purchase :)</li>
    <li> We got a good price, but... I don&#x27;t think we got a knock-off, but I&#x27;m suspicious.  The perfume smells great although it&#x27;s quite faint.  After a few hours there&#x27;s virtually no detectable trace.  I didn&#x27;t think the perfume should be so difficult to even smell without drenching yourself in it.  Maybe we got a bad batch, but spending this much on perfume is not something I think we&#x27;ll ever do again.</li>
    <li> This product is a fake. The color of perfume in the bottle is different from the original. It does very remotely smell like the original and even that scent disappears within an hour.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely love........good buy</li>
    <li> Well firstly I would like to note that the box it came in was in deplorable punched in condition that had tape everywhere on it, Apon opening I noticed a little cream for localized redness relief which was odd because I didn&#x27;t see anything mentioned about it in the description, now onto the bottle it came in a uniform Dior box though I feel the box takes away from the essence a bit :\, the bottle itself has a nice weight to it however the cap is plastic and has golden paint on it instead of what the advertisements say that it is hand jeweled however I believe these must be the mass produced versions of the product for the commoner and I disagree with the ones who say its not real. The smell is...well...it smells like one of those excessively strong colognes in magazines. it is mildly pleasant and it lasts for quite some time unlike the advertisement it also has a sticker instead of J&#x27;adore engraved on the bottom. However the nozzle / pump head is metal as is what surrounds it on the top the only plastic bit is the cap. I feel the scent is still not what I quite expected it has a stronger scent that you can tell the alcohol is in it. I would also like to mention there are slight tid bits floating around inside the bottle I think I even see a little bit of a hair</li>
    <li> My daugther love this parfum. She recommend for all women that like to surprise you boyfriend or your husband. That is all.</li>
    <li> OMG...I agree with most of these other reviews.  At first it smells real, but lasts for only a second.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
    <li> It was fake, I&#x27;ve had the real jadore that I bought at Macy&#x27;s and this one smelt nothing like it</li>
    <li> I have been using jadore for 14 years and this was a bad bad joke,the cheap looking bottle and the soap smell and the overall experience with the vendor , I would give it 0 stars if possible, bad customer service, bad everything, do not order please, I am so upset that amazon allows this</li>
    <li> my wife loves the scent, not to sweet. she&#x27;s super picky, this is her favorite.</li>
    <li> Great deal, simply beautiful.</li>
    <li> My wifes favorite perfume.  Happy wife.....</li>
    <li> Wife very happy and the fragrance is NOT over powering.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t live up to the in store sample I tried. Either a knockoff, or just not quite what I liked in actual use.</li>
    <li> Found this to be a excellent way to purchase this, the smell is really nice. an it was so easy to order also......</li>
    <li> My wife was pleased with the selection, she gets many compliments at the college that she works at. I also enjoy it when we get intimate. You won&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> perfume smells great and lasts long</li>
    <li> Great smell.  More for evening wear.</li>
    <li> This is a very soft cologne that I enjoy wearing all year long. This size was such a great value I just couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for daughter.</li>
    <li> Every now and then one finds a scent that works very well with their chemistry and this is the parfum that works best with me!</li>
    <li> Its a fake Jadore. Please don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love Jadore parfum and consider it my signature fragrance, but this bottle just wasn&#x27;t right. It smells wonderful when first putting it on, but within 30-45 minutes it completely dissipates. It seems that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;price you pay&amp;#34; if you take a chance on some of the discount parfum stores.</li>
    <li> i love fragrance but  don&#x27;t last longer than 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;and is expensive</li>
    <li> Same thing happened to me but with another perfume. I also have worn Jadore for years, and now that I realize it, I will definitely not buy expensive perfume from Amazon again.  You cannot trust buying perfume over the internet, even w/ Amazon. And they always get you w/ that non refundable catch. So buyer beware.</li>
