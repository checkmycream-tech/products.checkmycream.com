    <li> Actually this works OK but I gave it 2 stars as a coupon comes with a new shaver to get three more at a better price and includes shipping. It is probably good as a refill but I do not like the shave of the shaver that requires this and I have used Norelco&#x27;s for many years. Read my 2 star review of the 9200 and 9700 before you buy. This is only about $2 more than Norelco but better priced here after that. Just a heads up in case you want to buy the shaver and refills; the shaver comes with one starter cartridge and a coupon for a discount on 3 more.</li>
    <li> Fair price and am now on automatic delivery.  Wish I could get these cheaper, but so far this is the best.</li>
    <li> 1 container was75% empty</li>
    <li> great product and price with fast delivery</li>

    <li> Husband loves these for cleaning his shaver.  They work with his smartclean Norelco shaver.</li>

    <li> My husband really likes how clean these keep his razor. The solution does a better job than water alone. The solution has a fragrance, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. It does not bother my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin. Each cartridge of solution lasts for roughly 1 month with daily use.</li>
    <li> Saves time, blades are well cleaned which produces a good shave</li>

    <li> If you clean your razor daily after each shave, 1 cartridge only last for approximately 1 month. RDF</li>
    <li> Great price, authentic product. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Product was fine but leaked all over the the box, as a result useless.</li>
