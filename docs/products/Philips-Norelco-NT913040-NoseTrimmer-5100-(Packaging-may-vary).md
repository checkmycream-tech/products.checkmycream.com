<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Broken with minimal use within 90 days</li>
    <li> I purchased this primarily for the beard trimmer/clipper attachment. It worked beyond my expectations, although I have only used it a few times so far. It trims close enough that I can finish up shaving with my electric razor and does a good job shaping. I wish it came with a couple additional trimmer guides that allowed shorter, controlled trimmings. It also fits in an amazingly small case. Great that it runs on one AAA battery.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer for nose and ear hair, trimming eye brows or side burns. Best I&#x27;ve ever used plus it has held up well after 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> Light weight and easy assembly.  Safe and friendly.  Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I looked at all of the great reviews listed here and bought this trimmer in lieu of using manual groomers and items of that ilk. Unfortunately, I tried it all of twice but it doesn&#x27;t do anything but produce an uncomfortable vibrating sensation on my face. I just wanted to clean up my look not mow a lawn, but to no avail! ...&amp; of course I missed the return window so I ended up wasting money but I do hope to save you from wasting yours. Good luck on your search to find the perfect trimmer my hirsute friends;)</li>
    <li> Grooms well, powerful for it&#x27;s size and I love the angled heads!  I have used it to trim all my facial hairs, even my entire beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it would have come with one more height adjuster.</li>
    <li> Not bad for local product !!!</li>
    <li> broke after 1 use. Would NOT reccommend</li>
    <li> Disappointed in it&#x27;s ability to just trim the hair.  It misses hair and takes several passes to get it.</li>
    <li> Nice little product. Does the job. Easy clean up.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Does exactly what it is supposed to do cleanly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;Eliminating those pesky nose hairs is a breeze and the different attachments and case are a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend  this Philips Norelco NT9130/40 Nose Trimmer 5100 to those that care about their appearance.&lt;br /&gt;~ The Boss</li>
    <li> I/ve tried a few of these, I like this one to most, not sure it work the best and a nose trimmer, but I love the options.</li>
    <li> The perfect size and shape for detail trimming. Unlikely circular rotary trimmers that cut head on, this trimmer is much more comfortable to use in your nose or ears where you&#x27;re not just stabbing at the hairs hoping you get them. This trimmer uses a sweeping motion that guarantees much more precision.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. Feels great in your hands, I like the fact that it can/must be cleaned after usage. Once more, Norelco positively fullfilled my expectations.</li>
    <li> Wish this worked a bit better than it does. IT will get the job done eventually. Is a bit harsh on male sensitive areas and can cut the skin. For what it is it&#x27;s okay. The product could be better considering what most males are going to want to use it for, would have been an awesome product if it was designed more towards that.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and gets the job done quickly. So much better than the last one I had. Love it.</li>
    <li> A fine product, as described. I decent price for a decent trimmer.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer works great.  It can get in small places and it doesn&#x27;t pinch.  For the same reasons, it works great for trimming hair in your ears.  It cleans easily by holding it under a faucet.  It comes with a nice soft case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned other precision trimmers and other nose hair trimmers and I&#x27;ve never trusted the former to work as the latter. Moreover, I was never really happy with the nose hair trimmers I&#x27;d had in the past (all were the short rotating rounded deal that you have to shove into a nostril, hoping it&#x27;ll fit) because they always got hot and usually hurt in one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I discovered the NT9130. Within minutes of unboxing it, I had a sparkling, well-groomed nose for the first time in years. I swear, I can breathe better now than I have in a long time.  This tool gets every corner but doesn&#x27;t pull hairs or cut skin. Pretty impressive in my book!</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Nice and powerful for the size and for being battery operated.  The nose attachment does the job nicely.  It&#x27;s nice to see that the tip is waterproof so that it can be cleaned.  The shaver head is great to clean up the line on the back of my neck and sideburns after my diy haircuts.  My wife usually helps to make sure that it stays nice and straight.  She has used this same shaving head on her bikini area and says that it can sometimes be a bit nippy.  Before you get used to it, it is easy to remove the head while trying to turn off the unit because both actions require a twisting motion.  But with a little care and getting used to it, anybody should be able to figure it out.  I say BUY IT!</li>
    <li> easy to use, hassle free and just the way, one would like it to work. much better than the previous Remington version that i used</li>
    <li> Just what i need to get in those &#x27;hard to reach places.....&#x27; if you know what i mean - and its better than trying to get your razor up in your nose and ears, I always bled from doing that... glad there&#x27;s no more stained shirts.</li>
    <li> I go through one of these every six months or so. They are usually pretty badly designed and manufactured. This one feels so far to be of sturdier construction and the attachments are not as flimsy as others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armen</li>
    <li> I like the trimmer.it&#x27;s easy and fast specially when you are in rush.so far the blade is working great (I have it for almost 2 months).the only problem is that I will have pimples after using it but in general my skin is sensitive to every type of hair removing method.</li>
    <li> The best I have found. I always tense up when I put something that cuts in my nose, this never does.</li>
    <li> The nose hair trimmer works well, but overall, this is a mediocre trimmer.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  I had a cheaper brand similar to this.  You get what you pay for.  This is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> It works fine, so well I bought two.</li>
    <li> Does better job than what I had before :)</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, and being able to rinse it in water is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results of the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of nose hairs like it&#x27;s supposed to and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Not as precise as I had wished but it does the job after some tries and the long design of the hair remover helps a lot in ears and nose</li>
    <li> Works great and battery life seems good but haven&#x27;t used it enough to be sure.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim nose hair very well but cuts back of my neck and eyebrows with great ease.</li>
    <li> Seriously amazing quality! I am really impressed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s noisy.  The battery life is not great.  It doesn&#x27;t do a good job cutting nose hairs, and it can nick you.  It is better than the &amp;#34;Panasonic ER-GN30-K&amp;#34; if you plan to use it in on your body (be careful of nicks) or sideburns.  It&#x27;s not better if you want to use it on your nose.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a few ear hairs.  It works great for hairs on the rim of the ear and just inside the ear.  Also works well for nose hairs and eyebrows.  I was leery of putting it into my ear, but it cut the hairs cleanly without any pulling and no risk to the skin.</li>
    <li> Keeps eyebrows nose hairs neat.</li>
    <li> Does the job very well</li>
    <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t do what I bought it to do, so I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might have been a defective product as I couldn&#x27;t see the razor moving around much at all in the mechanism, no idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running it over my arm hair: nothing cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running it over my leg hair: a few  cut in a few passes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my nose: a few cut in a few passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not interested in the hassle involved getting another so well, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer!  Easy to use and change from one trimmer to the other.</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp; easiest to use trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Middle aged men everywhere: rejoice.  The holy grail has been found.  This thing blows away every other trimmer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> After emptying all of my dead Panasonic trimmers out of a drawer recently looking for one that might work I decided to try a different brand.  The cutting head on this style of trimmer is very different from the Panasonics I&#x27;ve had and I&#x27;ve decided I just don&#x27;t care for this design.  Trimming is awkward at best and it just doesn&#x27;t do as good a job on nose or ears.  So back to buying a Panasonic every 6-12 months I guess.</li>
    <li> perfect, battery powered trimmer that doesn&#x27;t pull out the brush that has started to grow since passing middle-age.</li>
    <li> Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using for weeks with no pulls or nicks. Just be careful not to try and change attachment with it running or you&#x27;ll damage the internal mechanics.</li>
    <li> Better than average but still seems a little hard to get all the hairs from your ear, the trimmer must be held at precisely the right angle.</li>
    <li> Not really very effective</li>
    <li> Does not cut very well, after 5 minutes of back and forth, twisting turning, I found my pair of scissors much faster and more efficient.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this trimmer, strong, sturdy, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. most importantly it DOES NOT SNAG NOSE HAIR! And if that wasn&#x27;t good enough the extra attachment allows you to easily manage your beard between barber visits. Strong recommend  from someone whose gone through quite a few bad trimmers,</li>
    <li> So far it has served me well.  I use it mostly for nose and ear hair trimming and it works very well.</li>
    <li> Thought it was great at first. I quit working after just a few uses (just like ever other brand that I have tried)</li>
    <li> Bought them in the past, but they were all cheaply made and worked poorly. However, I&#x27;d never seen this one in the stores.  After reading the reviews here, decided to try this one - and haven&#x27;t been disjointed.  I like the little zippered bag it comes with, makes it discreet to carry when traveling.</li>
    <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t nick or scratch. Very comfortable to use and great results. easy to use</li>
    <li> Used it twice and it stopped working. Piece of crap!</li>
    <li> I got this because the reviews said it was best for those gross ear and nose hairs.  It works great.  Makes a satisfying series of zaps as you move into a hairy area - surely it is cutting a hair for each zap because after a while that area is hair free.  Gets slightly warm as it does its work.  I wonder where the hairs go?  Do they need to be emptied after many uses or do they just drop to the floor?  I could breath noticeably easier after I cut down the thicket out of my nose. Needs 1 AA battery I think.</li>
    <li> nose hair trimmer, ear too.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very  efficient</li>
    <li> Did the product engineer ever try this creation before sending the design to production?  Please don&#x27;t waste your money as I did.</li>
    <li> This is a well-designed trimmer that works exactly as you would expect it to.  The additional attachments make it very versatile. The battery that came with it didn&#x27;t last very long but that&#x27;s hardly a problem (replaced it with a rechargeable one).  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This article es very good</li>
    <li> Bought two....my son and I both like it....best one I&#x27;ve owned in years...cheap.</li>
    <li> Headline said it all.  This one really works.  The on/off switch is very positive.  Nothing Mickey Mouse about it at all.  All you can say about it is that it works as advertised.  Which is unusual in this world.  Hat is off to Philips!!!</li>
    <li> Solidly made, this is much better designed than the Microtouch unit. The teeth are bit larger though so if you&#x27;re a guy using it in sensitive areas (ahem) make sure the skin is taut-otherwise you can nick yourself.</li>
    <li> What son-in -law wanted</li>
    <li> No pain! Great itemmmmm</li>
    <li> Six months down the road it still performs!</li>
    <li> did not last very long</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have had by far. No messes, always all clean. No hair to pick up if you are buzzing ur head. Really trims nice, doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and its also very nice looking. Would highly recommend this to any guy out there. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very convenient, precise, and works perfectly. It comes with a very handy case. I wish they made on with rechargeable batteries, but I can&#x27;t really complain about this one.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay. It cannot seem to cut nose hair properly and nor does it style my beard well. Wife wasn&#x27;t happy about the product either. Fancy looking - yes. Great product - no.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this rubbish. Bought 1 and the on off switch failed on day 2.  Thought it was just bad luck and bought another. Same thing. Second use and the switch failed.  Can&#x27;t believe they are getting away with this</li>
    <li> Does well on batteries. I wish it cut a little better but it is great for the price.</li>
    <li> Wow, gorgeous organic-like minimalist Euro design that gives the closest shave without any chance of cuts or hair pulling pain makes this one of my best purchases ever.  I previously used a top of the line Panasonic unit for 2 years.  The rotary Panasonic gave reasonably close shaves and was generally painless unless one let the battery get low and tried to cut hair too aggressively.  Suffice it to say you were soon taught to never go there again.  While the Panasonic was good, this Norelco is dramatically better, and I am so happy I gave it a chance.  There is no risk of hair pulling or skin cutting so you can press against the delicate nose interior hard enough to get a very close shave in every nook and cranny.  There is more of a requirement to twist and maneuver the unit properly but this should not be an issue for 90% of users. Frankly, if you have no problem maneuvering a popsicle treat you will be fine with the Norelco. The twist on twist off switch is smart and will never inadvertently turn on while stowed in your luggage.  Trust me, this is the ultimate nose hair trimmer!</li>
    <li> TWO STARS ONLY BECAUSE IT LOOKS NICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried this for a month...it just was NOT very good...the cheap trimmer this was going to replace is far more effective at trimming.  The trimmer head on this system glides OVER the hairs you want to trim.  Gave it to the wife and she had the same issues...it is in the trash now.</li>
    <li> Nice but limited.  It will NOT cut anything but a short short hair.  If the hair is longer than about 5mm it just moves away from the cutter.  It&#x27;s great for the little bristly ends that i leave around my ears after shaving my head.  Also good for nose hairs.  Cuts painlessly but it will not cut longer hairs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a month ago here on Amazon. This is the 4th nose/ear hair trimmer that I have bought over the last 5 years and the only one that works. I threw the other 3 in the trash after getting this one, because they just do not really work at all. They are all the rotary type.    I was really wondering if any  of these will work, and had pretty much given up hope that any of them do. But then I saw this one on Amazon and thought, well, why not try this different type of trimmer. Very glad that I did.    This thing not only works, but it works amazingly well. It has a lot of power from one AA battery and it will remove absolutely all hair, nose, ear, anywhere. It just works and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs. Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to and more. Arrived on time and very good service. Muchly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works easily and completely. Better than any others I have tried!!</li>
    <li> Does nose hair and ears as advertised.  Trimmer works very well around neck and side burns.  Unit is great and packaged nicely so ;that I can keep it under the sink or pack it for travel quickly.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it five stars is that I don&#x27;t know yet how long it will hold up to moderate use and stay sharp.  If it still works two years from now - five stars.  I also like the comb that fits over the trimmer to thin facial hair and eyebrows.  It keeps those looking neat.</li>
    <li> It works better than I had expected. The fact that the head is waterproof and can be cleaned is nice. It also comes with a case to keep everything together.</li>
    <li> Love Philip Norelco products and this is no exception. I really like the attachments that came with this.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works very good.</li>
    <li> Got this for our son for Christmas.  He really likes it and has had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty bad luck with most of this type of product, using various brands and styles.  Mostly, they seem to develop electrical issues where the device ceases to function reliably, even with new batteries, and the cutting system doesn&#x27;t reach where it needs to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had this NT9130 for a few weeks, but the angled head and close-in blade system do such a better job of getting those resistant nose hairs.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on my husband&#x27;s ear hair or sideburns yet, but it seems like this new device will make the effort much more efficient.</li>
    <li> I think this thing is great for trimming sideburns, the back of your neck and eyebrows.  However, it isn&#x27;t very good at trimming nose hair, which is really what I bought it for.  The long skinny trimmer will reach into the nose just fine, but the angle isn&#x27;t good for cutting nosehair since nosehairs tend to point downward, parallel to the angle of the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side I like that it uses batteries instead of being rechargeable.  It&#x27;s a lot more convenient and isn&#x27;t constantly sucking power from a wall outlet.</li>
    <li> These type of things usually don&#x27;t work.  This does.  And we&#x27;ll.</li>
    <li> my fiancé like this alot</li>
    <li> My husband purchased one a while ago and was very pleased with this item so I purchased the same item for my brother-in-laws and father-in-law.</li>
    <li> Works great, and its simple to use</li>
    <li> I like the trimmer but it already quit working properly. I have to take the top off to get the machine to operate and then put the top piece back on while it is running otherwise it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> It is powerful (with full charged battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean... no really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets the hard to get places of other trimmers.</li>
    <li> Teh best trimmer I have ever used, it has a great feel to it, and it does the job perfectly well</li>
    <li> Works well in most cases but not as well I would like. It actually works very well for ears. The problem is you need to push in on the hairs you want to cut and you need a surface underneath, like you skin for it to cut well. This is why it does not work well for eyebrows if you want to cut hairs that sick out a bit. Touching the hair with the cutter does not cut it but pushes it away. I had the same problem with nose hairs. If you try again and again it will eventually work but it takes too much work .</li>
    <li> Sorry but I had been using a Panasonic ER430 and there is just no comparison. It does OK on stuff like armhair (just OK according to my wife) but on nose and ear hair it&#x27;s not good. Generally, I _really_ like Phillips Norelco products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this trimmer, it is junk. I owned this for three weeks and used it twice - it no longer works at all. This is the second Phillips Norelco product that I have owned and that product was also a piece of crap -  so much for second guessing. I am very disappointed with Amazon for selling crap like this...</li>
    <li> Just not what i was expecting...tried to use it once and then packed it up and put in drawer with other useless grooming machinery. I thought this was a rotary deal...i also thought it was rechargeable....it takes batteries....ew.</li>
    <li> The one star is for Norelco&#x27;s website policy of coercing the purchaser to go through a survey to warranty the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. This this doesn&#x27;t clip hairs well at all and it has snagged skin twice. Ouch! I&#x27;ve had 12 dollar cheepies from the drugstore work better. My wife also tried it and she agrees that&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. I am hoping that a fresh battery will give this thing more cutting power.</li>
    <li> Wonderful little trimmer &amp; can rinse under water. Great for all the hair that grows in funny places when you get older.</li>
    <li> After 10 minutes operation the motor made a loud metallic noise and bound up. Couldn&#x27;t  make it work so I threw it in the waste basket and will look for something else . Don&#x27;t want a run around dealing with a warranty.</li>
    <li> Trimmed my hair and sideburns perfectly for the party that I had to go to! Hopefully this lasts a long time</li>
    <li> It does the job but was just alright.  I feel like this did the exact same thing as the cheaper knock off brand.  Fails to hold its charge for much longer then a week, considering I use it 1-2 times a week that is unexpected.  Otherwise it works.</li>
    <li> The trimmer performs as advertised!  I am well pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I got for personal use.before I had similar however when I received this was a very good surprise for me.Super and precision trimmer.Strongly recommend</li>
    <li> I like this one the best. It won&#x27;t snag like others.  It runs pretty quiet too.  Don&#x27;t be the guy with over grown nose hair sticking out.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, what more could you ask,, best one i have owned , easy to use in those small places in you ear</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dubbed it the Bushmaster1 in honor of its nosescaping prowess! I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all but this makes the call.. none better!</li>
    <li> just ok.  I used to have a cheap trimmer that cut easier and closer.  This model sacrifices that for an unnecessary safety buffer</li>
    <li> Off the rip, understand I am paraphrasing my father, the person for whom this purchase was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the review: \\&quot;Wow, Orly. Thanks! This thing I awesome. It works well and it&#x27;s not ripping any hairs out! I love the little attachments, and it&#x27;s really good. You&#x27;re the best son in the world!\\&quot; I added the &#x27;best son&#x27; line, but my point is valid. Well-built and it pleased my father, so that&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> The Philips trimmer works so much better than any rotary trimmers I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I would recommend this for anyone who needs to deal with the annoyance of trimming nose hairs.  I&#x27;m sure it would work well to trim other areas like ears, but I&#x27;m not in need of that just yet...</li>
    <li> Very nice compared to other cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> After about two or three uses ive noticed that the razors dont cut fine hairs very well. Im not sure if the razors just worn out or if its due to a cheap design. But I would not reccomend this product look elsewear im just not at all happy with how well the razor blades cut.</li>
    <li> Not a very good trimmer at all. Weak motor is unable to cut hairs and the attachments are clunky and also do not get the job done. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Normally I prefer norelco products. Do yourself a favor and buy the Wahl micro groomsmen trimmer instead. It actually cuts the hair and not your body!</li>
    <li> Functional, compact and serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> I bought a $6 cheapy that bit me on the arse, literally.  Much to my relief this Phllips hasn&#x27;t had a nip, even though I still haven&#x27;t  got over this dreadful experience, and cant use one of these things without being extremely alert. The unit does a good job and I would buy it again. It is now two years of trouble free trimming.</li>
    <li> Have tried similar products in the past with little success. After many years gave this Phillips Norelco trimmer a shot and I&#x27;m glad I did. It works better than expected saving me time and effort from using scissors and the dreaded tweezers. Not perfect but grooming is much easier and more thorough than before.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver straight out of the box in somewhere where no one can see... Right away I was bleeding in a place where I wish I wasn&#x27;t. I literally never cut my balls but this had done it. I used it for other places like my side-burns, arm-pits, chest hair .etc THEN I tried again in my private place and it worked perfect. I noticed the Trimmer is very sharp at first and should be dulled a little before you try to shave your private parts. Good little trimmer does the work and makes my skin feel soft down there but that just might be the shaving cream haha !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as one of his birthday gifts. He absolutely loves this thing. It&#x27;s easy to use and completely pain free.</li>
    <li> This cuts real good and close.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and fair price</li>
    <li> i like it, but keep having to buy a new one after my current one flakes</li>
    <li> perfect trimmer that i was looking for my nose....five stars...</li>
    <li> Top notch product, works like a charm, easy to clear with warm water. I do it after every use, don&#x27;t worry that the batteries are still in it.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and have a mustache.  This keeps my mustache in line and my sideburns squared off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Texan</li>
    <li> Great for trimming all hair.</li>
    <li> Used it 3 times and it stopped working.  New batteries didn&#x27;t fix it, it&#x27;s a dud.  We managed to put  man on the moon but we can&#x27;t make a trimmer???</li>
    <li> This mini trimmer is just what I needed for unwanted facial hair.  It is quiet and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I want to like this device, but it really just doesn&#x27;t work.  I wanted one that isn&#x27;t the type with the round pointy top that works pretty well in your nose, but not well anywhere else.  This product basically just vibrates.  It doesn&#x27;t actually assist you in trimming any of the hair around your nose or ear as it would be intended to.  I&#x27;m returning it, unfortunately.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product, and it&#x27;s well built. It&#x27;s now part of my weekly ritual, Great as a gift for any occasion.</li>
    <li> Bought this for nose hair, but I use it all the time. It is great for the nose hair, doesn&#x27;t painfully pull out the hairs like rotor trimmers. Also use this to trim my beard before cutting it with a razor. Great product all around, worth spending money for something that actually works great.</li>
    <li> No problems at all this far. Everything works fine. I read good reviews of this product, and it has lived up to them.</li>
    <li> it is very quality product. and price is very cheap.  i bought it for my husband and he love it</li>
    <li> works great, close cut</li>
    <li> It&#x27;d be nice if the head was adjustable instead of fixed, my husband says.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. Easily trims all sorts of hair and doesn&#x27;t really cut anything. I&#x27;ve caused a couple bloody spots in some sensitive areas but I was probably asking for it.</li>
    <li> Makes a lot of nice, but really does not remove the hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve has this for awhile. It is better than a couple of other brands I tried. I&#x27;d still like to find something that cut node hairs quicker and more thoroughly than this one does. Basically, it gets the job done, but it takes longer than it should.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer.  It does an excellent job of trimming nose hairs without pulling!  My husband has used the eyebrow trimmer as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect nose hair trimmer. No pulling of hair and cuts  hair very close to skin. This is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever owned. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> It broke after 3 months of usage, i uses this once every 2 days. It was good while it last.</li>
    <li> It does the job.  I had a similar looking Remington, but the angle of the cutting head on this one , and the RPMs makes this a superior product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer seems to get closer than the rotary-type one I used previously.  The neck/sideburns head works better than the finer bladed head, which I use for trimming the hair in/on my ears.  (oh, the joys of getting older!)</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Easy to hold and direct.  Sharp.  Could be rechargeable instead of plain battery.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I received this in 02-2015, and went to use it tonight and it will not turn on.  Changed battery and it still will not turn on.  Has a 60 day warranty and now threw away my money on this item.</li>
    <li> the item is not effective. I had much easier time with much cheaper products. I am not sure who would rate this product positively. Waste of money. I dislike it so much that f the seller wants to refund me I will be happy to return this item.</li>
    <li> For ear/nose hair they do OK. Don&#x27;t pull hair out, but actually cut it. The eyebrow attachments don&#x27;t work for me since they cut them too short but are only plastic so no great loss. Sideburns trimmer works OK too. For the price, I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
    <li> This cuts the hairs in my nose, ears, eyebrows, etc.  I haven&#x27;t use the trimmer yet, but I am sure it is going to work as well as the rest of this.</li>
    <li> Feels a little heavy and awkward in the hand but does the job and overall happy. Takes a little room in the bath vanity as well.</li>
    <li> works good most of the time.  have had to take battery out and reinsert twice in the first few weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer due to the great reviews. Unfortunately, it is an awful nose hair trimmer. Due to the contours of the nose, one cannot get to the hairs without hurting oneself. It probably works for other parts of the body such as facial hair where the area is flat. However, as a nose trimmer, it fails miserably. Avoid it!</li>
    <li> Does the trick fine for nose and ears. Still working properly after some months (some haven&#x27;t). Only complaint is that the plastic attachments are brittle and broke easily. Can recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had previous nose hair clippers that used a rotary motion. They never worked for me. When I saw this device on Amazon, I was immediately intrigued because it has a back-and-forth motion. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and it clips my nose hairs beautifully. It also has an eyebrow and ear function that I haven&#x27;t used yet, though I&#x27;m sure that will work just as well.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer.  Very smooth, doesn&#x27;t grab, cut close and excellent battery life.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I dropped my formerly relatively new trimmer on the bathroom floor and it broke.  I decided to try a different kind of trimmer, the Norelco Precision Trimmer, and am pretty impressed.  I must admit, that at first, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with it&#x27;s ability to trim hair, but as I adapted to its design, the trimmer actually has done a much better job for me.  Once I started to use the trimmer properly, I started getting superior results.  In fact, better than the old style of trimmer.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to widely position your arms to enable the slant to come in contact with skin (nose or ear)--the results will be wonderful.</li>
    <li> cool little tool---works great---threw the other two I had in the trash---the trimmer is a nice bonus-- you will think this is money well spent</li>
    <li> Recommend.  It has a couple attachments.  Works as it should. Would recommend this if you need a product like this.</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are over 50, you NEED this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does NOT HURT EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for nose, ears, sideburns.</li>
    <li> much better than a rotary and doesn&#x27;t pull or cut nostrils</li>
    <li> This is a very useful grooming tool.  It not particually loud and has function that work well for a number a mens grooming needs.</li>
    <li> Used it for my mom on her neck. It was very gentle and not noisy or large which she was afraid of.  Great trimmer.</li>
    <li> Kicks butt on ear hair also cuts great on nose hair to.  Cleans with water.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this for trimming side burns and around his ears. Gets those nose and ear hair with no problem. Can even trim eyebrows. If I needed another one I would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Hard to rate. This is advertised as a precision trimmer, probably with the nose and ears as it&#x27;s intended focus. In that regard, I&#x27;ve found it and others of similar design less than satisfactory in terms of precision and close trimming. Unlike the Panasonic rotary trimmers (which I consider the benchmark in this category), this trimmer is difficult to aim and does not shave as closely as rotary trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing saving this from a 1 or 2 star rating is the trimmer attachment. The ear/nose trimmer can be removed and replaced with an included flat trimmer measuring approximately 7/8\\&quot; wide. It seems to the the perfect size for evenly trimming stray eyebrow hairs and managing sideburns. More so than the flip up trimmer in my Norelco shaver. For this reason alone, I&#x27;m giving this a three star rating. Without it, I&#x27;d say pass.</li>
    <li> So far so good , no problem with it so far , very efficient , don&#x27;t Miss out on this</li>
    <li> Loving it. Much better than what i expected. So far, this thing has done it&#x27;s job and i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Our son, who is a handsome redhead with a pretty cool look going for him, is, at the time I am writing this, 22 years old. He works 5 days a week, despite the fact that he is non verbal, and has epilepsy as well as severe autism, at a special place (it is wonderful) for people with disabilities.&lt;br /&gt;He needs to dress and bring lunch every day to work. In my opinion, if he is going to do the job, he deserves to look properly groomed! That is something I am proud to help with, as his mom.&lt;br /&gt;Many people and children with Autism are hypersensitive to different sensations.  I wanted to be sure I would have a very easy time trimming my son&#x27;s &amp;#34;Hip&amp;#34; goatee ( think Robert Downey, Jr. !) as well as the back of his neck.&lt;br /&gt;Having just done this trimming, for the first time, I have got to give 5 stars to this fantastic Precision Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It is everything I could have hoped for!&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more...HE LIKED IT!  This was kind of a fun experience for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely consider this product if you are not looking for a full on cordless shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it comes with a really nice traveling pouch, its own battery, ready to install (now that was a great source of happiness for me!) and an extra 6 month online warranty if you head over to the Norelco site and register. Which I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, IF YOU HAVE DISABLED KIDS or adults in the family,  consider this trimmer for them.  My reward was a big smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even rinse this trimmer under the faucet for cleaning. It does come with a brush as well for cleaning some of the accessories!  Love this company, Philips Norelco!  Really nice product.</li>
    <li> So many nose hair trimmers you find in the store are complete junk, you can feel how cheaply made they are in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re lucky if a nose hair trimmer you buy lasts even a couple weeks, you replace the battery and still nothing; dead.&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco is another story though, thankfully!&lt;br /&gt;Well worth whatever I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Keeping me well groomed</li>
    <li> This the best hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used: good for eye-brows and nose hair.  I thought about trimming the bushes in front of my apartment with this baby.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is excellent because it comes with different two different heads and several attachments which make it perfect for quite a few different things. The smaller head is great for trimming the hair inside and around the ear and also in your nostrils. The larger head is good for trimming your sideburns or your beard. There is an attachment for the larger head that allows you to trim your beard for a shorter hair/groomed look. There are two attachments for the smaller head for trimming your eyebrows. It is definitely an all around good trimmer for all your grooming and care needs and best of all you can wash under the stream of water from the sink. It uses one single AA battery and this provides good power for anything you may need. I am very satisfied with its performance and will continue to use it for a long time. Even comes with a little bag that organizes the trimmer and all its attachments for easy storage or even for traveling and not loosing any of its components.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a nose hair trimmer which has the round piece that houses a blade which you must stick in your nose. It would miss a lot of hair due to the inability to maneuver around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works much better and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> nice groming tool it does the job well for cleaning up nose and ear hairs also good on side burns and cutting before you shave</li>
    <li> My husband and I have had many trimmers over a period of many years, but one was my favorite and it gave up the ghost.  I was looking for a new one.  I&#x27;m so happy I ordered this one.  We bought a cheaper trimmer at the same time, but I absolutely LOVE this one.  It trims without pulling hair and I just can&#x27;t say enough about it.  It has it&#x27;s own little bag and it&#x27;s put up for any little thing I want to trim.</li>
    <li> Looks good, fe.els good while in use &amp;#60; in the hand that is. Trims ok . Easy to clean after each use.</li>
    <li> Came with many attachments I&#x27;m still not sure what some of them or for. Seems powerful and does the job.</li>
    <li> Best Ear/Nose hair trimmer I have ever owned ! Excellent attachment for sideburns too .</li>
    <li> Like the product &amp; comes with additional head &amp; pouch to carry it all in.</li>
    <li> Price is not as per the product quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over priced</li>
    <li> Philips makes products I like, but this one just sucks. Who the hell uses batteries? Granted it&#x27;s only one double A, but come on! The trimmer blade it cut you up when it&#x27;s designed for use on sensitive areas. The lack of a vacuum feature just leaves all your nose hair inside your nostrils. Yay!</li>
    <li> Just got this today and it works great. Hooray no nose hair!!!!!! It worked great and I hope this continues!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Works great.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer, I did see all the negative comments about this trimmer, but it does what is suppose to do and I love it and glad I did get this trimmer and I&#x27;m very please..... Would recommend this trimmer to anyone. Does trim your nose hair well and elbow also.</li>
    <li> Very smooth for both nose and ears. Attachments work well including guard for sideburns. Powerful enough for thicker hair. Good buy</li>
    <li> The straight trimmer on this little unit works great, and has no problem chopping through my thick mustache and bear hair.  The angled nose hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well for me, but maybe I&#x27;m not aggressive enough with this thing up my nose.  In any case, for the price, this is a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> ok but not very effective</li>
    <li> Removes some hair. Not as effective as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Grandkids don&#x27;t like grandads with hairy noses.  This little trimmer is great.  No put-off grandkids and much easier to use than any other type.  I have one at home, one at the office.</li>
    <li> Not good&lt;br /&gt;My old Panasonic nose trimmer broke down after 3 years of use so I purchased this one but very disapponited.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link for panasonic trimmer if some one wants it works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ER-GN30-K-Facial-Trimmer-Cleaning/dp/B0049LUI9O/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1432052293&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;panasonic+nose+trimmer</li>
    <li> Tried two of the heads, and both are sharp and work well.  Solid, lots of cutting power, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It was great for a week. Then it just went dead.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. It works really well for nose hair and eyebrow trimmings. The pouch is ridiculously bad. It&#x27;s really cheap and needs an inside compartment for the smaller accessories. The handle of the trimmer has a rubber &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; part. Getting it to fit into the elastic band in the pouch is difficult. I&#x27;ve only used it twice now. Other than the pouch, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of trimming nose and ear hair,requires a few tries to get the pivot action right.</li>
    <li> Excellent value!  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. I bought a replacement after a few years only because some of the pieces started breaking. I still had the original batteries so battery life is great just off of 2 AAA&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is for sure a do not buy item. It  does not work as described. I can&#x27;t get it to cut nose or ear hair.</li>
    <li> So far these trimmer is the best I have found.  Use it on my nose, eyebrow and mustache hairs.  Has interchangeable heads for specific trimming.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 5 star rating because it does what the advertising says it does.  For the price it performs well and so far I have not had any problems with this product.  I would recommend it to my friends for a fairly inexpensive personal groomer that performs well.</li>
    <li> Would like to be more powerful as I have to repeat multiple times. The design is good and easy to hold, perfect grip etc.</li>
    <li> It has two heads which is really nice and even came with the battery included. yay. It seems very solid and has a 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> With all of the attachments, there is not much this product won&#x27;t do. I bought it for my husband for a number of grooming reasons but it&#x27;s absolutely worth it if you want to use it just to trim your eyebrows! This is a must have tool for personal grooming.</li>
    <li> I have had other devices meant to do the same thing as this trimmer, but none worked as well as this one. With a second head, included, I can also trim my sideburns and moustache. This is a first rate product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.  It was a very good price for a quality product.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The quiet, precision cutting does the job well. As an added bonus- now my wife doesn&#x27;t chase me with tweezers anymore.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great.  I wish it had more than just a single trimmer &amp;#34;snap-on comb&amp;#34; size.  But really, that&#x27;s a minimal issue.</li>
    <li> This does well for ear hair or really fine hair but not more coarse hair.  Does not really cut the coarse hair but more like grinds it away and you have to run the trimmer over the hair ten times to actually cut the hair as desired .</li>
    <li> Item is well made and comes with the needed accessories and a great carrying pouch.  Fit and finish is above average.</li>
    <li> The small size makes it easy to handle and the motor is surprisingly powerful.  It makes a good haircut trimming tool also!</li>
    <li> Nose trimmers never quite work in trimming the nose hairs. This one seems adequate for at least trimming the worst of the unsightly curly strands. I would have liked to have a light on it to make my nasal cavity more visible. Recommendation: keep the cutter blades clean after every use. I use WD-40 and some sewing machine oil.</li>
    <li> The $5 Remington trimmer I bought works 10X better.  1 or 2 swipes and the hair is all gone.  The Philips Norelco trimmer doesn&#x27;t do the job half as well.  Save your money and go with something else.</li>
    <li> This product is good for facial hair, eyebrows, beards, mustache, but I also wanted a good nose hair trimmer, which this is not. Unless you are flooded with hairs on the outside, the trimmer is tough to use for inside the nostril.  The attachment makes you move around in a way which is difficult to both trim and see the hairs you are trying to trim. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or purchase it again. I&#x27;ve had other products that worked better but were less painful in the nostril area....nevertheless, I haven&#x27;t thrown it out yet</li>
    <li> Good product, does what you need it to do, but it wore out in about 18 months.  I&#x27;d buy it again, but I don&#x27;t understand why it now costs $39.95...  it was $19.95 when I bought it in December, 2013.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut close enough. So don brother, you will not like it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome trimmer. I keep my nose and ears clean. Works great.</li>
    <li> Better than any of the others we have owned.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave Amazon reviews unless the product is absolutely stellar, or really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is stellar. Amazing. Absolutely one of the best things I&#x27;ve spent $20 on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was getting a new nose hair trimmer. I did. This one doesn&#x27;t suck. It&#x27;s much better than the ones that are essentially a teensy blender blade in a cylinder.  I haven&#x27;t yet cut myself, but I imagine there&#x27;s probably a higher risk of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but that&#x27;s not why I decided to make this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The features that make it an awesome eyebrow trimmer (precision shaving with the vertical trimmer and a pair of combs for evening the rest out) is probably what I end up using the most. If you hate plucking your brows to keep them plural, this is an amazing little trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the wide trimmer for sideburns is good too, and much easier to handle than the one built into my Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put the tweezers away (well, not entirely, but use them a lot less) and buy this.</li>
    <li> I went over several different trimmers but this is the best one.&lt;br /&gt;The long narrow end help me to clean my nose thoroughly. And the tight clipper make it very clean cut.</li>
    <li> Great product; however my husband does not use it as much as I thought he would.</li>
    <li> Just received this and used it for the first time.  I was always afraid to get this kind as opposed to the rotary ones, afraid it would bite me.  Finally decided to try it  figuring I could always return it.  Well for the first time in years my nose hair is gone and I feel clean in there.  I know for some of you this may be TMI, but for those of you who have a hard time keeping up with the nose hair growth, I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not bite me and I intentionally let it touch me.  There are no stragglers left in there.  My nose is clear.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know it deserves 5 yet.  The motor sounds like it could be a little under powered, but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Precision Trimmer is the best for trimmer hair in the nostrils. It does a great job on the ears also. It is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> These are nice, I like the attachments included.</li>
    <li> Okay, like they say ... You&#x27;ve tried the rest, now try the best! I&#x27;m 62 and this is the &amp;#34;first&amp;#34; nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve EVER used that actually works like it is supposed to! Gets ALL the hairs in your nose quickly and easily with no pulling, and trims close. Light and easy to use, base is fine for standing up in the medicine cabinet or use the included pouch. Has lots of attachments, but I got it for only for the nose hair trimming. Get it!</li>
    <li> Honestly. This product is for something who had light hairs or at least thin hairs because it definitely did not worked for me due to the fact that my hairs are or were a little thick for this trimmer. I did not find the attachments much useful either. Instead i bought Gillette fusion styler and am much more satisfied with that then this.</li>
    <li> Good and cheap little micro trimmer.  The eyebrow guards are useless but I don&#x27;t use those.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this product because I didn&#x27;t think it could trim my nose hairs properly but I was wrong! This product works better than all the round head nose trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.  It trims very close and can get into all the hard to get areas great! Just make sure you clean it as instructed after every use so that the blades don&#x27;t get clogged up! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> A great product for the price and a very nice surprise when you get it. It also comes with a larger trimmer head, cutting length guides and a carrying case. I didn&#x27;t read about any of that in the add.</li>
    <li> To be honest I was looking for a nose hair trimmer and I saw this product was really cheap and had good reviews and it so I ordered it. I had no idea it was an eyebrow trimmer and razor. My experience with it was amazing. I really loved using the eyebrow trimmer and nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer. Before I tried the other attachments I didn&#x27;t think it would amount to much. The trimmer without attachments, as used for nose hair isn&#x27;t the greatest, you have to work at it to do the job right. When using the different attachments for trimming other places such as eye brows, arm and body hair or even private areas the usefulness of this trimmer shows up big time! Worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement for me husbands \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; cutting blade trimmer, which took forever for him to trim those unsightly hairs.  This one is fast, easy to clean &amp; uses it for touch ups to his mustache. No complaints !</li>
    <li> look no further.  this thing rocks.  very sleek.  easy to clean.  1 battery.  just buy it.  oh and it doesn&#x27;t cut you or hurt.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer for fast trimming of ears and nose. I have tried a number of other trimmers and none of them come close or last as long.</li>
    <li> This little machine works well but you can&#x27;t be in a hurry. You&#x27;ll have to spend some time to get good results especially in your ears and nostrils.</li>
    <li> Now to be fair, there were no issues with this product whatsoever. I purchased this item on a whim, to see what difference it would make in my daily grooming. It does get the job of grooming nose-hairs and eyebrows done, but not in an impressive way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found myself relying on my trusty razor to go over anything missed by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only require minimal grooming, this product may be for you. If you require intense grooming in certain areas, you may be better off looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever owned!  Cuts very close to the skin WITHOUT actually taking skin off.  Will definitely get again if it dies.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not great but it does the job.  You do have to make sure the cutting edge is firmly against your skin for it to really trim where you want.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for trimming hair from the ears.  Easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> Quite surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the little &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; micro trimmer that I&#x27;ve used for several years.  To operate the unit you twist the blue handle - that&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s also easy to turn it too far which results in opening the battery compartment.  Finally it would be nice if it had a wide enough base that it would stand upright in the medicine cabinet - it does stand up but the base is small and it is somewhat top heavy so the slightest bump and it falls over and out into the sink.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very hesitant to buy one of these new wand type trimmers. But the condition of my old trimmers was so bad I had to do something. I was pleasantly surprised by the NT9130. First the build quality is evident as soon as you hold it. Its heavy, and the materials used feel good in your hand. After getting used to the angles, I&#x27;ve found that it trims very well. It was important to me to find a trimmer that uses a battery instead of being rechargeable (battery burn in). This little trimmer fit the bill all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a little carry case for the trimmer and its combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> No pain hair removal.</li>
    <li> A few dollars more than the next one but I needed to replace my last Norelco. It takes a little more time with the round head but it does the job with out pulling or tear out your nasal or ear hair.</li>
    <li> Really a nice one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and safe. Does what its designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy and use it to experience it.</li>
    <li> I like it very useful and it replaced the blades i used</li>
    <li> works great on nose ears moutache I like it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the side burn attachment.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this thing for my nose and eyebrows, and don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works like a charm. Though, as a few of the reviews suggest, it malfunctions rather quickly. I&#x27;ve only used it three times since buying it, and I have been very careful to take good care of it. Now it just won&#x27;t come on, ironically after the deadline to return it. I&#x27;ve tried a few brand new batteries, but the thing is just dead. A waste of money and time. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I did not have one of these before, so this was the first time using one.  I purchased the Philips/Norelco NT9130/40 Nose Trimmer after reading reviews of several different Trimmers, and looking for the features of what I would need to take care of my Nose Hairs and Sideburns.  This Trimmer is the best!  I was able to trim my Nose Hairs with no Pinching, Pulling or any discomfort whatsoever!  The Sideburn Trimmer Attachment works great too, and the whole kit fits nicely in the supplied pouch.  Make sure you rinse your Attachments under warm water after each use in order to keep the cutters free from mucus and extend the life of your trimmer!  It only takes a few seconds after each use anyway!  The Philips/Norelco NT9130/40 Nose Trimmer works great and is a real bargain for the price!  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s happy with this and so am I.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a great trimmer for nasal and ear hair for years. The Norelco NT9130 is just another very average trimmer, which, like all of the others I&#x27;ve tried basically doesn&#x27;t really get the job done. It seems powerful enough and it&#x27;s somewhat nicely designed. It just doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well, which is sort of a problem because that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This trimmer comes with a few different attachments and settings.  It is not a heavy duty appliance so it is perfect for grooming/trimming the occasional unsightly body hair (nostrils, ears, fingers, toes) but it&#x27;s not powerful enough to blow through a thick beard.</li>
    <li> Cuts with excellent precision. I took it to Vegas with me to use with my face trimmer. It takes care of the small points the face trimmer can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My son-in-law requested this product.  I searched the reviews and this one seemed to be what he wanted and I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect according to him.</li>
    <li> Like the idea of it. Just doesn&#x27;t trim well for me and, well, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for, isn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;d do more research next time and spend a bit more</li>
    <li> I have had several different types of these but this really works very well. best one I hjave ever bought. Very smooth and really works</li>
    <li> I have tried several differant types of trimmers but none have come close to how well this one does</li>
    <li> I am impressed at how well this modestly priced trimmer works. I use it in nose, ears, sideburns and mustache and it does the job!</li>
    <li> This is the best nose hair and eyebrow trimmer I have ever used. A typical quality Phillips product. Well engineered and nicely built. I am planning to give these out as gifts come Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> others are oh so right...opening this small tough package will result in many Emergency room visits.  Waaay overdone.  Norelco really needs to take note.</li>
    <li> The reviews don&#x27;t lie. This trimmer really works well. I have owned several others like this one, but this is the best by far.</li>
    <li> Battery operated and the little cutter for nose hair, ear hair and whatever else might need a trim is pretty hard to use and does not trim well.  The other heads are just fine.</li>
    <li> High hopes but this was a fail in our house. The unit would not stay on after even brief use and even with alternate new battery. Besides that, the blades on the main shaver option were large and far apart so what are the chances for a close shave. Rough, at best. Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s appropriate return policy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awkward to contort your hand and get the blade edge against your skin to cut the hair.  Not what I had hoped.  Looking for a new one.</li>
    <li> its pathetic, does not do the job well. for nose or ears or any other part of the body. i dont know what can you trust if not philips.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do all that good of a job cutting the hair. I feel like I have make multiple passes in order to get the result I want. I have always liked my other norelco products but this one was dissapointing</li>
    <li> Comfortable to hold and works very well.</li>
    <li> Needs several runs to trim. I guess has to be that way not to damage your skin. Do not expect a clean cut, as razor blade. Very appropriate to trim delicate skin parts.</li>
    <li> Really works good, What a nice kit.</li>
    <li> I looked around for the best precision trimmer and bought what I thought to be the most popular and cost effective.  I am pleased with this one as it is safe under running water and has nifty attachments to groom anything.  My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I think it is in fact it is the best thing i have ever used it is to me Fabulous</li>
    <li> Works great so far. Use on small areas such as nose or ear. Doesn&#x27;t hurt and cuts well</li>
    <li> Fantastic cutting and the only style we like.  This blue model died after receiving a replacement from amazon...that one broke too.  now a third broke .  We had he same brand but solid black....lasted years.  New mechanism?  Don&#x27;t waste money on this one.</li>
    <li> Great product with more features (eyebrows and sideburn) than conventional trimmers. Don&#x27;t even think about the Panasonic 430. I owned one and it didn&#x27;t work well and died prematurely. The Norelco is a superior product in every way.</li>
    <li> Perfectly designed and makes trimming nose hair easy and painless.  Since the blade is visible on the outside you have a better control over the trimmer, as against other cylindrical nose hair trimmers that you shove into your nose and hope it will magically &amp;#34;do the needful&amp;#34;.  Have used the other eyebrow trimming attachment for defining my hairline right over my ears after cutting my hair with my Wahl hair trimmer.  I&#x27;ve given it 4 stars only because it doesn&#x27;t run on electricity but a pencil cell instead(which means i&#x27;ll have to buy a pencil cell when this one runs out.). An otherwise perfect trimmer that does its job well!</li>
    <li> Chews through boogers like my kid nephew. Seriously, it works great. So much better than the cheap ones I used to buy at WalMart.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is much better than other brands I have used. I love the curved handle and accessories that come with it.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect trimmer for facial, ear, and nose hairs.  Very sturdy and multipurpose.  Comfortable to use.  Wonderful price!</li>
    <li> Had a problem with the nose trimmer getting stuck so I called customer service.  They agreed to send out a replacement part, even sending confirmation email.  I wait a few weeks and no part.  I check the order status and the order is mysteriously &amp;#34;cancelled&amp;#34;.  I call again.  No explanation.  They will try again.  Still waiting for the part.  This purchase wasn&#x27;t worth the aggravation.  They should either make a better quality product, or have better customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice and it works and is gentle.  It does the job of trimming nose hair great with no problem and its very quick.  I haven&#x27;t yet tried the trimming feature so can&#x27;t comment on that feature.</li>
    <li> Have this product for myself &amp; wanted to give one as a Christmas present. Like the quality compared to competition.</li>
    <li> it is very good ，very easy to use. but the price is a little expensive.i use it several time.the trimmer is good.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco NT9130 is a decent trimmer for eyebrows, nose and ear hair.  It trims well, and does not pull or pluck.  The head design is superior to rotary trimmers as it allows the user to quickly address all problem hairs right down to the skin without spending an inordinate amount of time repositioning the unit as one otherwise has to do to draw hairs into the slotted rotary heads. After using rotary units for years, I am very happy to have found the NT-9130.</li>
    <li> Trims nose hair like no other trimmer on the market and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Gets that nasty nose hair easy and comfortably. I used to use a little scissors and would get infected when I got to close. This works beautifully! (That nose hair is not very lady-like.)</li>
    <li> I have very hairy nostrils, and I have to say this device only does a so-so job of getting at the hairs. A bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it would be.  takes care of ears, nose and stubble.  Would reccoMmend.</li>
    <li> This is not the best trimmer.  It takes a few passes for it to cut the hair.  Its just ok.</li>
    <li> Works great keeping my beard nice and tidy. Gets most or all of my nose hairs without any irritation. I have thick curly hair</li>
    <li> Every man needs one of these.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  It&#x27;s the only trimmer that my wife will use to cut my hair and beard.</li>
    <li> I like the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of this product when I am using it.  I was glad to see how safe it was when trimming.  Because of the clipper design, I don&#x27;t think that you can cut yourself with this trimmer.  This trimmer comes with a few attachments that allow for easy control when trimming eyebrows.  I did not expect that.  Also, that cutter head can be rinsed with water.  Battery operated, means no shock hazzard and no cord to cope with.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco NT9130/40 Nose Trimmer is a good, well balanced trimmer. Feels good in your hand and easy to maneuver. The accessories work fine also.</li>
    <li> This works very well, does a nice job trimming unwanted hair, quiet and has all the needed accessories. Nice package.</li>
    <li> Does the job effectively and has a neat case to keep it all together neatly.Phillips always have nice products and I like them all.</li>
    <li> No complaints, excellent product for the price.  Useful as an all-around personal groomer.  A slightly larger trimmer attachment would have been a bonus, but it&#x27;s still great.</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing this precision trimmer I had been juggling a hair trimmer, mustache scissors and some old wahl single battery trimmer that would nick me enough times to make me look up a precision trimmer.  This is by far the best thing to happen to me since my girlfriend.  It&#x27;s keeps everything in check and lets me do as many or little touch ups as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been looking or considering a trimmer, then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  I also prefer it to a rechargeable kind.  The only con of it is the pieces that come along with it.  Make sure to keep it in the bag they provide and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for me and made me use it.  After getting used to the buzzing so close at my face, I like it very much.  I look so much more groomed than I used to.</li>
    <li> WOW. A first: I had to come on to make a positive review. I am totally delighted. Third time I try to buy such a device. This one works, and works very well. FIRST use, no difficult, no fuss, no pain, and the hair is gone. THANK YOU, PHILIPS!</li>
    <li> The trimmer head will not stay on the handle. The trimmer falls off, does not click onto the handle, I have to tape the trimmer head onto the handle.  It is only 2 months old but I just passed the return window.  I had an older Norelco that I tried to get repaired or replaced by Norcel but the cost was higher than a new one.  Pretty lously customer service, terrible warranty.</li>
    <li> Good product for cleaning and clearing nose hairs to protect against squirrels building nests in nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;The trimming attachment works well, too.</li>
    <li> This is very convenient. so much nicer than using scissors an no danger of cutting yourself. my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get all the good reviews.  The trimmer does a terrible job on both nose and ear.  I can get a much better trim using the clumsy pop out on my electric shaver.</li>
    <li> The is the best nose/ear hair clipper I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;The small adapter for trimming the top eyebrow makes it even more useful . No more accidents timing more than desired.</li>
    <li> Really well put together product to get ear and nose hair under control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every design of ear nose trimmers on the market and this design works better than all the others.</li>
    <li> It may look technical but it simply doesn&#x27;t trim or cut as advertised.  It pulls verses cuts.  I expected more</li>
    <li> Nobody will ever see this review but I want the star count to reflect my satisfaction with the product.  It is worth every penny compared to the as seen on TV product.</li>
    <li> I really like the noise, ear and eyebrow attachments. The beard trimmer attachment works well, but is not made to shave off thick beards.</li>
    <li> There were mixed reviews on the trimmer I looked at, Philips Norelco NT91xx where xx was 10 or 20 (I&#x27;m not sure which. So I ordered this trimmer, because I thought that since it had the higher number (xx&#x3D;30) and was more expensive it would be better. I do not regret my decision at all. All the parts were there (one of the reviews claimed they were not) and it operates just great. It also is cleanable by just putting it under the running faucet, a great feature.</li>
    <li> Great product and buy.</li>
    <li> Simply Amazing!!! Excellent Trimmer that I have used. Right Investment with right product. Thank you Philips for creating an amazing product..</li>
    <li> Does a great job trimming around ears, nose, eyebrows and any other place hair grows. The attachments work great. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Product is okay.  Not as easy or efficient to use as advertised.  Actually, the design makes it somewhat awkward to use .</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband as a birthday present. Trims very well, no tugging.</li>
    <li> Good deal, works as expected.</li>
    <li> Bought it specifically to fix my eyebrows but it doesn&#x27;t work for it, it can&#x27;t cut that type of hair.</li>
    <li> The worst electric devise I&#x60;ve had.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband..uses it weekly and he said it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s happy , so I&#x27;m happy too !</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no tug on hairs, does its job!</li>
    <li> I prefer these nose trimmers to the type with the tipped, spinning blade as I find that they provide a quicker, closer trim without pulling hairs.  This trimmer is certainly no exception.  The rubber grip keeps it firmly in your hand and a single AA battery will give you months of use.  The various attachments are very useful and the case keeps everything in place when you travel.  I also like that I can simply rinse the blades with water to clean them off then pop the cap on to protect the blades.</li>
    <li> Works as promised - great!</li>
    <li> Everyone will love this for sure</li>
    <li> My old trimmer finally died and I replaced it with this one and was really surprised with how much better the Philips Norelco worked. In addition to a trimmer for ear and nose hair it has extensions for sideburns or mustaches, I have not used those extensions but can say the ear and nose trimmer is excellent.</li>
    <li> This device worked great...for a few weeks. Then it stopped working. So, basically, I would not waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> buy it.  you&#x27;ll not regret it.  expensive but built to last.. it&#x27;s so nice I&#x27;m afraid to use it. does it all and does it very well.</li>
    <li> Powerful little trimmer with just the right attachments for the price.  I like it a lot, perfect for trimming eyebrows, nosehair, or anywhere a little trimmer is needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and was a speedy transaction, I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a smooth close trim.</li>
    <li> Great price for an awesome trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I had a few of these, none would compare to the accuracy and easiness usage of this one!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, quite, and NO Polling!</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this, but it works okay. I have blonde facial hair that sometimes gets long around my jaw line and wanted to shave it off - so I bought this unit. It is difficult to cut closely and the attachments hurt my skin as you must use a decent amount of pressure  to cut as closely as possible.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase.  It does everything I have asked of it and it does it flawlessly.  The adapters that it comes with allow you to trim ear and underarm hair comfortably.  I have not had any incidents with this device in the last six months that I have owned it.  It comes with a travel case and I have taken it with me overseas and all over the U.S.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a close trim on ears, neck and top of bald head. Does not cut well at all. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Good product, work very well. I am very happy with this machine. Don´t hurt my nose or ear. Accesories and all is fine.I definitively recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Trims nose hair pretty well. Would definitely buy another if the first one ever fails.</li>
    <li> this doesnt reach some places that it needs to.  i still wind up with hairs coming out.</li>
    <li> First one of its type and I tried 3 others that actually works more than a week or so.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised....</li>
    <li> It works great and is perfect for trimming my mustache and beard. I am so glad I purchased this model.</li>
    <li> Like it. It actually works</li>
    <li> I use it for nasal and ear hair.. yeah... I got that...&lt;br /&gt;It shaves really close and lasts a long time on the battery.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t get the little eyebrow butterfly shaped attachment to do anything... Just didnt cut.. Maybe its for longer hairs or beards? Or you are supposed to go against the grain?&lt;br /&gt;I like that you can wash it off.</li>
    <li> Very good price for a solid product...</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product, seems well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that shaving surface was little larger, otherwise it is not bad.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for ears and nose. Very easy to use product. Does the job. I would very much recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. Even though I don&#x27;t use it for ear or nose hair (thankfully, don&#x27;t have them), I found that this trimmer is great to manage chest and armpit hair. Another use: manscaping. ;-)</li>
    <li> For me this is best product that i have used for nose and ears.  I used to use a rotatory trimmer, but I find this is much better.  It is fast and a closer cut. It came with a nice case for traveling as well.</li>
    <li> Died after less than two months.</li>
    <li> Small, light (but still feels solid), effective. It works well for light use. I knocked off one star for not being rechargeable, but that&#x27;s about the only flaw I can find.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my husband.  It arrived promptly.  My husband could not be happier.  The trimmer does not pull hairs but trims a close to the skin.  Easy to handle.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;I first tried to use it when I hadn&#x27;t trimmed the hair in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t effective on long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Once I trimmed the hair a bit this trimmer did a great job - better than the rotary trimmer I had.&lt;br /&gt;No problems cleaning it.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly.  Very smooth running with great angle.  Very quiet and comes with a nice pouch.  Would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> This does pretty well at clipping hair, but not great.  It works after a few passes.  It&#x27;s cheap and eventually gets everything, so 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer very much. It is as described and I like the included aattachments. Philps makes great products!</li>
    <li> Look at the picture to see the difference.  The trimmer head is like a miniature shaver.  You insert it in your nostril and rotate it to shave the visible part of the nostril.  More comfortable and much more effective than the usual round-headed nose hair trimmer.  Plus, it has an additional trimmer head for trimming outside of ear, under chin, whatever.  Plus, some plastic pieces that snap onto the trimmers to provide an even but not-close shave (like for eyebrows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a useful, well-performing, sturdy-feeling product that&#x27;s worth more than the $20 I paid.  I just got it today, so I can&#x27;t comment on durability.  But I&#x27;m pleased enough that I wanted to get this review out right away.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few months now. So far so good. I trim nose hairs, mustache and it&#x27;s doing the job that I need. Not suitable for close shave. Nice carrying pouch, looks overall very chic! It&#x27;s a Philips!</li>
    <li> quality trimmer with many attachments, easy to trim nose hairs , neck and ears.&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of power to trim all your hairs.</li>
    <li> Finally found a nose trimmer that works! All others to this point have failed miserably. And it&#x27;s rinsable. The extra trim items that came with it I haven&#x27;t even tried.</li>
    <li> I have tried several trimmers that worked to varying degrees, but all left something to be desired as well as hair in my ears. This is by far the best trimmer I purchased to date. Battery life is superior to the others and better yet, it does a fair job of trimming the hard to reach hairs in my ears. I recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. no problem!</li>
    <li> Been using a Conair trimmer for a while and the difference between that one and this one is like night and day, this one is far quieter and doesn&#x27;t &#x27;tug&#x27;.  Love the included case and attachments, very well thought out</li>
    <li> The motor jams up sometimes.  If I beat it against the table long enough it kicks back into gear again.</li>
    <li> It works ok but doesnt do eye lashes well. I would rec this to work side burns or basic stuff</li>
    <li> Terrific gadget.  Works better than all the others that I have tried. Both attachments work as advertised.  Easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> Like one of the previous reviewer, I too find this trimmer disappointing when it comes to trimming nose/ear hair. I used to have the Panasonic vortex that worked very well for many years until I damaged the tip by accident. I thought I would give this a try. What was I thinking? This trimmer doesn&#x27;t pull hair as it promised but I&#x27;m thinking it achieves that because it can barely trim even a few strands of my ear hair. Alas, I thought about taking advantage of the product&#x27;s 45 day satisfaction guarantee but I&#x27;m a couple of days late (must be postmarked prior to the 45 day period).. I&#x27;m gonna purchase the Panasonic trimmer and write this one off.</li>
    <li> This is the second nose clippers in one year I bought. First set quit after a few months. This set also quit after a few months of use (once a week for two months) normal cleaning after each use. Soaked the head in WD 40 and it started working again. Been oiling the head while running every 6 weeks or so and its been running great since. What can I say except I got bad nose hair or really sticky snot!</li>
    <li> I trusted the Amazon reviews of this product and as usual, they were spot on.  Works exactly as advertised.  I like that it is disposable battery powered rather than rechargeable.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Best nose hair trimmer I have ever owned. Will buy this same trimmer for my adult sons also. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer I use it all the time!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I also use it for my hair above my ears, I hope it can last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can wash it easy without taking any part off and AAA battery is the best part!</li>
    <li> Even though this is relatively inexpensive it does a good job.  I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months and it still cuts well.  My only complaint is sometimes you have to make 2 passes to get a good close cut but otherwise a solid performer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different types of these personal hair trimmers and this is by far the best. Trims very close and unlike others has yet to pull on any hairs. Construction feels solid and the motor feels like it has ample power. I would recommend this to anyone over a rotary or straightedge trimmer.</li>
    <li> Fits where it is supposed to and gets a clean cut as well... lightweight but then again, it was made in &amp;#34;*****&amp;#34;... so but a nice case, good little additions with it... like it.</li>
    <li> I got exactly 2 uses out of it before it died.  Last used it 2 weeks ago, went to turn it on today and it was dead as a doornail.  Changed batteries, tried various positions, just totally dead.  Complete waste.</li>
    <li> Works much better than the rotating nose trimmers.  Had other expensive 7-1 trimmers and the nose attachment never really did anything to be honest.  This get the job done really well, but to get the trimmer up there you really have to put it pretty far up.  If trimmer was closer to the tip it would be better, but imagine trying to eliminate the sharp edge risk of poking yourself.  All in all works great, but can still break sensitive skin if you arent careful!</li>
    <li> I had the previous model for two years &amp; was extremely satisfied.  The new model is even better.  Very well made and works beautifully without any skin irirtation.</li>
    <li> I have to say the product has worked well for me. Is it top tier? probably not; however, for the price its a very good bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> I have tried another unwanted hair trimmer before buying this one, and it got hot burned my nose and pulled the hairs it seemed so not very pleasant!! So it was with a little bit of apprehension that I bought this Philips but I haven&#x27;t regretted it one bit. It has a small area where it cuts and mostly protected by a plastic cover in the other areas such that it hardly can be felt when it cuts!&lt;br /&gt;I can warmly recommend this device!!!</li>
    <li> OK, but not as good as the Panasonic I had that died.  It surprised me that the cutting head is NOT rotary, like their shavers, and like the Panasonic, so YOU have to rotate the trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works flawlessly, I love this little thing. It literally will not pull at all, cuts hairs and you wont even feel it, unlike other trimmers it does not pull, and for me thats important cause who wants nose hairs being pulled !?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks good , feels solid, my only wish was that if it came as a more expensive option and was rechargeable, that would be great since right now it uses batteries and not that they run out quickly but still. I think the days of changing batteries all the time should be over now... But other wise a great buy and at this price a steal for sure</li>
    <li> Very nice. I finally have a trimmer (nose hair) that I can count on.</li>
    <li> Works well &amp; hopefully will last better than the previous one I owned that broke quickly</li>
    <li> Had this for 2 years with light use and it died. Put a new battery in it and it&#x27;s still a dead device. Good while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Time to hack those nose hairs away! When it comes to body hair trimming, Philips Norelco is a brand I&#x27;ve come to trust over the years. This nose trimmer is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shove this bad boy into your nostril and let the weed-wacking begin! You can get pretty aggressive with this trimmer without the fear of cutting or hurting the inside of your nostrils, so don&#x27;t worry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, this nose trimmer comes with an attachment that can be used to cut sideburns and neaten up your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a nose trimmer, it&#x27;s time for you to get one. This is a simple option that won&#x27;t break the bank. Will require you to purchase batteries occasionally though as it is not electrically powered.</li>
    <li> I use this occasionally for nose hair and have had no issues with it pulling on the hairs as it cuts them.  It is easily cleanable and has other attachments and trim length guides that make it even more user friendly.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Phillips Precision Trimmer.  I chose it both based on the angle of the cutter and the price.</li>
    <li> Had a similar product that wasn&#x27;t working well. After reviewing the comments I decided to try this trimmer. Very happy with it. works well to trim nose and ear hair as well as touching up around ears etc.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco trimmer.  When working, it truly functions very well.  All three failed prematurely (less than 3 months), with the last no longer working after 3 uses.  The same failure -- the on/off switch failed.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Works very well with those super long stray hairs that show up on your eyebrows. Also good trimming nasal hair that you can&#x27;t reach with grooming scissors. And, for a quick trim of the back of your neck this thing works great in a pinch. This trimmer is also useful the ladies wherever they may need some edging. Nice versatile cordless trimmer. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> satisfied.  good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a trimmer, and it does its job. It doesn&#x27;t clog, it doesn&#x27;t use up batteries very quickly, and it can get down very deep. Personally I used mine for both sideburns, the nose, the neck, and the more personal areas. The first three it will do splendidly on with the attachments, but you will probably feel some discomfort on the last set if you&#x27;re not very very careful. I was able to nick myself once or twice in a year of using it, so that&#x27;s barely a minus.</li>
    <li> your better off using small primping scissors.  I would guess these have a 75% success rate at trimming my nose hair....just not good enough.</li>
    <li> best trimmer i have ever used.  much better than all others i have had</li>
    <li> I use this little trimmer all the time. It always works great and is perfect for trimming those stray hairs that are always bugging you. I haven&#x27;t used the nose trimmer yet, but if this thing lasts as long as it looks and feels like it will I will still have it around when I have old man nose hair.</li>
    <li> This item is merely sufficient for what I have used it for; ear and nose hair. Frankly the Mangroomer I bought in 2012 was great and still is, although I dropped it and now I have to hold the head on manually. Should have just bought another. This product is overpriced for the job it does. I have another Norelco trimmer that I purchased because of the reviews and it is not that great. Not too happy with my Norelco purchases and think I will avoid them from now on.</li>
    <li> This may be the last trimmer I will ever need. I am not entirely satisfied with the speed it cuts my nose hair but taking sufficient time it does an adequate job. It does a better job than the last trimmer I had,and it is much smaller. I also like the fact that one AA battery lasts a long time. The attachments for trimming mustache and eyebrows is great,</li>
    <li> This thing never worked that good and now it&#x27;s dead and I didn&#x27;t use it very much.  No new battery will make it work, I&#x27;ve tried.  Always seemed to chew up batteries too even when it did work.  Also now twice as expensive as it used to be.  DO NOT BUY this.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve always used the &amp;#34;Seen On TV&amp;#34; MicroTouch trimmer and they always end up wearing out after a year or so. They&#x27;re cheap enough and work well that we bought another once the old one died, but this time I figured I&#x27;d give something &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; a try. I wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco doesn&#x27;t cut hair nearly as well as the cheap MicroTouch and it doesn&#x27;t get as close to the skin either. I feel like I always had to make two passes to get the long hairs, and even then, it leaves maybe 1/16th of an inch of hair whereas the MicroTouch leaves it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended up losing this on a vacation and I&#x27;m not going to waste my money buying another one.</li>
    <li> Well built, high RPM&#x27;s. Sounds like you could trim the hedges with it! Wish it had blades on both sides though.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer mostly for nose hair and it just doesn&#x27;t get the job done well.  The cheap $3 manually trimmer that I bought at the grocery store works better.  I&#x27;m talking about the one that is made of plastic and you twirl the bottom which spins the trimmer.  I think the basic problem is that this trimmer&#x27;s blades are only side facing, which makes it fairly ineffective at trimming nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Finally, a nose trimmer that actually works.  Stop buying those rotary ones that never work.  I used this one and all hairs were gone for quite a while.  This is the best trimmer ever.  It has attachments for nose, ear, eyebrows and sideburns.  This is the only product you need.</li>
    <li> This little gizmo works wonderfully.  I was a little worried about it being batter operated and not rechargeable but the battery lasts for quite a long time.  Haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet.</li>
    <li> This was a christmas present for my husband, he hasn&#x27;t had a chance to try it out yet, but he did love it, he was surprised when he opened it, he had it on his christmas list, so it will be tested very soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming eyebrows.  Not so good for trimming nose hair because it only trims at a side angle</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Only thing it doesn&#x27;t have is an attachment to thin your hair between hair cuts. Well, it should because it&#x27;s a quality piece of merchandise that is great for eyebrows as well as ears and nose.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to get those stubborn nose hairs and to tame my bushy semi-unibrow.  It works exactly as advertised!  I tried to use the round one with one of the guards on my eyebrows but they proved to be too much for it, but the other head worked just fine on em.  The round head is great for nose hairs: doesn&#x27;t pull them, simply cuts the hair, no pulling...I haven&#x27;t figured out what the guards will be used for, though.  The trimmer head is great for the eyebrows (with the guard) and cleaning up the little hairs that the barbers miss right in the crease of your ears.  Great little tool for cleaning up the stray hairs and help you look that much better.  Bonus is that it comes with a carryng case for it all!  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great!  Works for nose hair, eyebrows and ears which are all an annoying part of getting older at least for me.  Wish I would have bout this sooner.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item, although the reviews from hundreds of people says it is the best, it is not.  It does not work, not of me or anyone else.  I was very disappointed with this product.  You are much better of the buy andis trimmers, they may be a little more expensive but so worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all, tweezers, scissors, the rotary clippers.. and nothing works like this does.  Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it once... but it was a flick of the wrist on each nostril and they never looked better.  The tool has a substantial feel to it and seems like it will last a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried to trim the eyebrows with the included guards... it worked but took numerous passes which is probably a good thing.  I&#x27;d rather take a little off at a time so there is no room for error.  I bought it for the nose, but the eyebrow capability is definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I like that it is battery operated.  No need to ever charge, and the battery will probably last years.  Keep it simple.</li>
    <li> Works great with basic setup. Attachments are sketchy.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco NT9130 D-Finer Precision Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;by Philips this was a gift for someone else and i think they liked it</li>
    <li> This trimmer was everything I was hoping for.  The ease of use, the efficiency of the trimmer, the lack of pulling hairs, make it the perfect trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this one accidentally; I&#x27;d intended to buy a different one of the rotary type but got confused between the windows apparently. Am happy it happened; this one works really, really well. No pinching, no pulling, no cutting yourself accidentally as I&#x27;ve had happen with other trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The horizontal blade works really well for removing knots from my cat&#x27;s fur, too. I don&#x27;t worry about cutting her and it cleans up with no trouble at all. I got this one accidentally, as I said, but I&#x27;m glad it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/21/14: Three months in and the nose attachment has failed. I dunno what&#x27;s wrong with it, the motor&#x27;s fine, and works the  horizontal eyebrow/sideburn cutter with no trouble, but when the nose one&#x27;s on, silence. No motor noise, no movement. Take it off, motor fires right back up. Had to knock off one star for that. Going to see if I can find a company contact.</li>
    <li> Everything good about the product, easy to install, apparently not there to complain, Good Product and excellent.&lt;br /&gt;would buying follow this kind of accessories.</li>
    <li> Affordable, quality and fast shipping! The bag that keeps it in is nice when you&#x27;re traveling. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> So far I like it a lot. Compact and efficient. Has now broken after less than a year. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product, have used four years.  Well designed, solidly built, remarkably powerful, easy to use.  Much better than the several other &amp;#34;nose hair trimmers&amp;#34; I have tried before.  I don&#x27;t use most of the attachments or the carrying case, but they are all solidly made as well.</li>
    <li> This Phillips Norelco trimmer does a great job on my eyebrows, ears and rascally nose hairs (yes, I&#x27;m that age).  Much better than the circular trimmer I used before, which did more pulling than trimming (ouch!)</li>
    <li> Not enough cutting edge to cut the hair. This is probably a production issue. Also the loops inside the holder are too narrow to slip the trimmer through.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time making this thing do what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  I will have to find something else to use.</li>
    <li> well i bought it mainly to trim the hair in my nose, not that i have many, but they sometimes grow so long and embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;i tried to trim my nose hair with this and it hasnt prove to be efficient, i am back to those conventional little scissors people used to trim the nose hair in 1800!!</li>
    <li> Better than average. Nice shape. Easy to use. Good nose trimmer</li>
    <li> This is my 5th trimmer from different makers, and is the best I have ever had! Good companion to my Philips Norelco electric shaver.</li>
    <li> It work really well and i can use it to shave the hairs on my chest as well. I could not find the on-off switch at first but I found that you just twist the base. By far the best trimmer I have owed.</li>
    <li> Ok. But not so great.</li>
    <li> Battery powered, runs for long time. It is sharp so stretch skin to be trimmed, may not be good for women.  works on all kinds of body hair even my tough thick hairs. good price. enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is a well-crafted, nicely designed trimmer. It feels solid in the hand, but isn&#x27;t too heavy. It seems well-built and I am confident it will last a long time. However, it has taken some getting used to. The trimmer I used to have was not Norelco brand and was not built as well as this, yet it lasted me several years and allowed for more precise trimming than this one does. However, I still like this trimmer more and highly recommend it. It just might take a few times to learn how to use it to suite your needs. By-the-by, it works nicely to trim down a light beard before shaving.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought the most expensive covers Amazon had ($5) in the hope that they&#x27;d last a long time, but the material is so flimsy I cannot imagine that will be the outcome</li>
    <li> If I could give this no stars, I would.  Greatly disappointed because as a nose trimmer it is a failure.  The nose trimmer blades do not line up along the whole attachment, instead there is a nub at the top that is the same length as the blades and the blades cannot cut the nose hairs and it can&#x27;t really reach the nose hairs because of the way the nostrils may be curved and isn&#x27;t stiff and straight. Since nose hair trimming was the only reason I bought this for my husband, I feel I wasted my money.  We tried several methods, including pressing the skin against the blade, stretching the skin and me doing it for him and nothing worked.  Clearly Norelco didn’t try this on a human being before launching this product.  Too bad, because my husband used to have a high regard for the brand.  We did not try the other attachments, so we have no comment on them. Nice case, though!</li>
    <li> the nose clipper part (why we bought it) clogs up every time we use it. Takes cleaning and messing with to make work every time.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works really well. I like that it&#x27;s lightweight, and the blade is protected so you don&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Trims really well and it&#x27;s easy to maintain. Helps keeping facial hair and unwanted hairs in check.</li>
    <li> My only issue is that after a little while it will no longer turn on without first removing the head attachment and then placing it back on. Otherwise it works well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in 2013 and I still have it. It can be used in the shower too. I&#x27;d like one with rechargable batteries or plug in power next time.</li>
    <li> Does the job well without pulling.  Far superior to my old rotary-style trimmer that pulled sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know where it was made, but it&#x27;s sturdy and well-made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I had only used a mechanical one before this with a little pain. I was leery about sticking a motor driven one up my nose but was pleasantly surprised. The product seems to work good and I cannot compare it to one of the rotary ones. I have used one of the attachments and it too works fine. I like the case, I can&#x27;t believe the companies who sell you a product with several attachments and no place to put them. I am glad I tried this.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve gone through so many different kinds of small trimmers like these and this one is the one to have. It is fast, sharp and easy to clean and it just works. Ot doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull or get gunked up. It feels heavy and well made and lasts a long time. I&#x27;ll never bother with anything else.</li>
    <li> This one fantastic device.  From trimming your neckline to attacking an occasional nose hair this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Multi uses. Great for trimming and minor cutting. Received before Christmas. Very handy tool to have around for &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; eyebrows and such.</li>
    <li> This is great!  It has some very cool attachments that make it easy to get rid of unwanted hair and look good.</li>
    <li> This trimmer really rocks..very heavy duty..with attachments and nice soft case...like a smaller Dremel tool or something.Yes, you pay a bit more...but you get A LOT more..easily worth the difference in cheddar. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works pretty good. I like all the specialized attachments that came with it. Seems pretty sturdy and might just last awhile.</li>
    <li> The second one of these I&#x27;ve had and am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was very reluctant to order this item. I&#x27;ve purchased simililar products in the past with very unsatisfactory results. The Philips Norelco NT9130 D-Finer Precision Trimmer has renewed my faith (Great Product!). If you&#x27;re in doubt as I was; Buy This Trimmer!!</li>
    <li> The product is not as good as it looks on the website. The blade is too small and is not as good as the old one I have</li>
    <li> After buying many other trimmers, my Norelco turned out to be the best one out of all of them. I think you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Finally, a trimmer that is solidly built, and works longer than 6 months.  I&#x27;ve probably had 6 different trimmers in the last couple of years.  They stop working inexplicably, they break easily, they&#x27;re junk.  This is the first one I&#x27;ve had that I can say I like everything about it.  Easy to use, easy to clean, and attachments that actually work. This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Got this in just the other day and fired it right up, trimmed my nose hair very well, and was somewhat impressed when I put the trimmer on and used it on my beard(very thick hair) it didn&#x27;t skip a beat and now I can easily clean my face up in less than 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that its not rechargeable, but for something that won&#x27;t get used and charged everyday that&#x27;s a good aspect to have. It comes with 1 AA battery though, so it&#x27;s ready to rock out of the box. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as always Amazon came through with their great service!</li>
    <li> I had a cheaper similar trimmer that was working, but you get what you pay for. It stopped working so I went searching for another. The reviews for this were helpful. I picked this one up and didn&#x27;t go wrong. It is much better than the cheaper alternatives.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is one of the best buys around.  It is excellent, compact and works great.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone needing a personal groomer.</li>
    <li> The price was good compared top even Walmart prices, this razor met my needs.  Hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought two of them as presents for my husband and his brother. both of them are satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a nosehair trimmer... it will trim your nosehairs... I guess one pro would be that it won&#x27;t nick/cut you (which is to be expected from something you stick in your nose). Other than that, there&#x27;s not a lot to say. It&#x27;s inexpensive, you can shave your nose, neck, and eyebrows with it, and you just replace the single AA battery when it dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muy bueno.</li>
    <li> So, I had been using a rotary trimmer for years before this. I never liked it because every once in awhile, I would get one of those \\&quot;am I dreaming\\&quot; or \\&quot;am I still alive\\&quot; moments when it yanked a hair out instead of cutting it off. At that point, I could confirm \\&quot;Check, I&#x27;m definitely not dreaming\\&quot; and/or \\&quot;Yup, I&#x27;m still alive.\\&quot; This Norelco product trims pain free, effortlessly, and much closer than I could have hoped for - so I could be dreaming. I only wish I had it years ago. I am going on more than 7 months of perfect operation (received ~ February 1st, 2013) on the original battery, and immediately after I bought it, my dad wanted one too. He is also going on over 7 months of perfect operation with the original battery. I use it to trim my eyebrows, hair around my ears, and of course, my nose hairs. It trims so well and so short that I don&#x27;t need to use it as much as my old rotary trimmer. I wash it every time I use it (because it says to do it) with warm water while it&#x27;s running, then while it&#x27;s stopped, and then once more with it running again. This is probably overkill, but I like to be thorough. I see some complaints in the reviews which I am almost certain are related to being too lazy to wash it after using it. So, I&#x27;m thinking, this is something you put in an area where mucous membranes are and if mucous gets on something and is allowed to dry, it hardens. It can almost be glue like. So, the trimmer blades get covered in a glue like substance from your nose, you don&#x27;t clean it, and the blades stop moving. Please tell me that you&#x27;re not surprised, and please tell me you don&#x27;t blame the product. What do you expect? Norelco tells you to wash it after you use it. There might be a reason why! Auto manufacturers tell you to change the oil in your car. What do you think is going to happen if you never do, or do it poorly? Bottom line, product works exceedingly well - and for some of the doubters or people who don&#x27;t like it because they can&#x27;t follow instructions, let me add this caveat: \\&quot;It works extremely well when used as directed.\\&quot; I am sure there are a couple of issues every now and again. Six sigma (which I&#x27;m sure Norelco tries to apply as they are big enough to do so) is only so good when it comes to quality control, so a rare lemon is to be expected. But considering that there are several negative reviews out of only 119, I&#x27;m sure intelligence or ability to follow directions has come into play - at least to a certain extent. I&#x27;m no rocket scientist, but it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to come to that conclusion. If the functionality ever changes within the next few years, I will update this review, but I have no reason to expect that it will. Additionally, if I can remember to do so, I will try to give an estimate of battery life after the time comes when I need to replace the original battery. It may not mean a whole lot as people use it differently and at different frequencies and for different durations, but at least it will give you a data point. December 2013 - It&#x27;s still perfect.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and fast. That&#x27;s all I have to say about the subject. I would have said less but the site requires at least 14 words. Take it for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple setup, nice and light, and plenty of power to get the job done painlessly.  The ear and nose trimmer attachment provides excellent maneuverability.  It did freeze up on me once, but a quick rinse under water got it running in no time.  The single AA battery seems to last quite a while as well.  Been a month and a half and I haven&#x27;t needed to change the battery.  I use the trimmer 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say much about the beard attachment, but it does work fine to tidy up the side burns and around the ears and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase, it lives up to the no-pain claim and works great.</li>
    <li> The item was as offered and is perfect for its function. I love it and I have no doubts to recommend it!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE THIS ITEM!&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy construction, painless trimming. Works every time without fail.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t go for cheap or you&#x27;ll end up with a trimmer that yanks the hair out, ouch!</li>
    <li> This is a great gadget with many uses. We&#x27;ve loved it so far! I use it when cutting my hubby&#x27;s hair and taming his crazy eyebrows ;)</li>
    <li> I found the trimmer to be very good and everything works as it should and its easy to use regularly</li>
    <li> Had one similar to this and could not find another one in the store. Got this one and he loves it. Works great for ears or nose hairs.</li>
    <li> got this for my guy who has an ear-hair situation.  Did a great job on his ears and didn&#x27;t hurt him a bit.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Like many battery operated trimmers this Norelco is at best OK.  Works fair on ear hair.  Not very good for nose hair.  Not really worth the $19.</li>
    <li> Great, high quality product...does it all!  Easy to use all attachments.  No complaints.  Purchase with confidence...quick and painless transaction.  Many thanks!</li>
    <li> after buying and using many others, this one by far, is the best. sturdy, handy, and works lise a bushwacker! love it, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different nose hair trimmers and they have all been very annoying - they either tickle the hairs and make me sneeze or hurt as they are not sharp enough (or fast enough). The Finer Precision Trimmer is killer. It doesn&#x27;t annoy at all and it is perfectly sized for both the nose hair trimmer and the standard trimmer attachment - allowing for some really exact Manscaping. Would buy again without thinking.</li>
    <li> I am a girl and bought this for me. I had a Conair trimmer and when it stopped working researched a new one. I would have liked to have a pretty pink, delicate one, but the truth is the ratings on those are horrible. This Norelco had the best ratings but was advertised for men. But they are generally the same whether they are pink or blue right? I have been so pleased with this trimmer. I use it for the bikini area. It had &amp;#34;no pull&amp;#34; technology and it really doesn&#x27;t pull. Easy to use, easy to clean, it feels solid. My only complaint is some of the attachments attach so snug I&#x27;m afraid I am going to snap something one of these times. As long as this gives me a good run for years I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product has worked great for that nose and ear hair that I started noticing when I turned 35.  Honestly I started noticing it on co workers years ago and then boom out of no where it was growing on my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a 30 year old male, just buy one.  Your time is coming.</li>
    <li> these things break very easily, but they all do.</li>
    <li> Well If you have thick hair it wont work with you. It is not really useful and fast.</li>
    <li> Good all around grooming all over your body.</li>
    <li> Best one I have ever purchased.  Very sharp cuts nice and close.  Does not hurt getting hair out of husbands ears like every one I have purchased before.I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants a EXCELLENT trimmer.</li>
    <li> My previous brand of trimmer was the Panasonic ER430 nose and hair trimmer. I was never really happy with this item as it did not trim the hairs close enough. Then I purchased this product and wow what a huge difference. This Phillips Norelco trims the hair in the nose and ears right down to where they cannot be seen or felt without any pulling or stalling, just a nice, quick and smooth short cut.&lt;br /&gt;And the attachments that come along with the product are very handy. Thank you Phillips Norelco for such a great quality item for such a fair price.</li>
    <li> Still mowing down the hairs after almost two years of use.  Just wash under water after each use and it will keep running.  Great product.</li>
    <li> One of the best nose/ear/eyebrow trimmers out there.  Easy to clean, durable, easy to pack for travel, easy to change attachments.  I want another one to keep at home, but it doubled in price.  Waiting for a sale, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer in April and found it to be well constructed and solid design BUT blunt in comparison to other brands. It lasted 3 months before it stopped working....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well made, but I have a cheap Wahl that cuts better. I guess Phillips was to concerned about someone going &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I have to go over the same area several times . I could have bought 3 Wahl&#x27;s for the same price.</li>
    <li> This instrument is the best nose hair clipper I&#x27;ve ever had!! Works great and has several options for eye brows and other options.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned several of these over the years and this is the best by far!!</li>
    <li> Have purchased 2/3 of these trimmers. When they worked (not for long), felt that they did an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; job. Not sure why I bought more than one of these. Guess It was on name and not quality.</li>
    <li> I bought a Remington trimmer which fell apart in a few days. This one is sturdy and does the job.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer.  It is easy to use and can use regular batteries.  I have had it for a couple months now and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is great for those annoying nose hairs, ear hairs, and eyebrow hairs that can get out of control if left unsupervised. The battery lasts a long time and the trimmers do a great job of trimming the hairs without any uncomfortable tugging or pulling. My husband is very pleased with this little device.</li>
    <li> I thought this was an overall pretty good trimmer. It has many nice features like the additional head, case to store, and included battery. It&#x27;s been a month so far since I bought it and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart. Because I have course hair (African American) I was especially worried about pulling but the product stood up to its word and was very comfortable. My only small complaint is that the trimmer does not always give a close enough shave. It took a bit of effort to get all the hair off. Overall though, I&#x27;d say it is a good product for the price if you need a nice trim.</li>
    <li> cuts well with everyready energiser.i have tried many of these products only to be dissapointed finding out that they just don&#x27;t work. this one goes very well and iim sticking to it. a very good buy at the price.</li>
    <li> It comes with several attachments so you can not only trim your nose and ears, but also beards, mustache and sideburns.</li>
    <li> Its perfect for trimming and won&#x27;t cut your skin at all because its not powerful enough to unless you really try hard.  But because of that it can sometimes take a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; version of the TV model thinking a company like Norelco would improve the product before putting their name on it.&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong! Out of the box this finer precision trimmer only managed to trim my calm demeanor. I cannot get it to cut any hair anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I will be VERY hard pressed to purchase another product with the name Norelco on it.</li>
    <li> Was very satisfied with Norelco product. Can be used as advertised. Accessories work great and do the job you expect.</li>
    <li> Works well. Still misses some tough to reach places in my nose. Works great around the ears. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes the best one.  This one&#x27;s lame.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it does as good a job as its reviews said.  Somewhat disappointed.  Like the shape, fits well in the hand, but doesn&#x27;t really clear out the nose hairs as completely as I thought it would - nor the ear hairs (two areas where hair seems to grow more aggressively as we men &amp;#34;age&amp;#34;).  It works OK - probably won&#x27;t buy another type now - but not as happy as I thought I&#x27;d be with it.</li>
    <li> So I bought one of those $10 one touch or whatever they were called a few years ago.  It finally wore out.  Found this thing online.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  It is like a piece of power equipment.  The only CON I can think of is it is pretty loud.  But whatever, it works great.</li>
    <li> I read the glowing reviews and ordered the fancy version \\&quot;because it is significantly quieter\\&quot; according to reviewers. Good grief, if this one is quieter I cannot imagine what the cheap one sounds like. This thing is hearing damage loud. Stupid loud. May as well press my ear against a chainsaw loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does it actually work? God no, it hurts like hell. You scrape forever with it and rarely hear it grabbing any hair. Meanwhile you are becoming deaf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used a sharper image nose and ear trimmer for more than a decade till a battery burst inside it ruining it. This is not an acceptable substitute. I am going back to sharper image and hopefully they still make the same product. It only hummed and loud noise was from the actual hair getting cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed with this garbage. It may be acceptable for trimming beards (I do not have a beard) but it is no good at all for nose / ear.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great with interchangeable heads and its not too expensive, its great for the price. Had no problems with the trimmer either.</li>
    <li> I got self conscious when my neice said I had hair in nose.  I laughed at first, but sure enough, there was hair sticking out of my nostrils.  WTF, I am getting old I guess.  Anyway it took some practice with this, but I eventually got those unsightly octopus tentacle sized hair from my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most useful product I&#x27;ve bought in a while.</li>
    <li> This item was delivered before expected. Item exactly as described and appeared to be new ? Unfortunately one of the plastic parts cracked with first use, but Norelco has promised to replace it. It just made us wonder about how this was stored ?</li>
    <li> Work so much better than the generic version that I previously had. It is fast and efficient. So much easier than scissors or tweezers.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is as advertised.  It&#x27;s great for trimming small areas and the travel case it comes with is an added plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a precision trimmer.</li>
    <li> Needed something to clean up around ears when I cut my husbands hair.  With the big trimmers I would cut him sometimes not using the guard.  These make things much easier.  Takes off hair easily with no risk of cutting skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer that does several tasks very well. Several attachments are included that make this a very versatile device. The eyebrow trimmer works extremely well. Be SURE to read the directions.</li>
    <li> Barely works and the tops don&#x27;t stay on while trimming</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  5 stars for the soft case that holds all parts in one place so they don&#x27;t get lost.  Trimmer attachment is great as well</li>
    <li> Must be the gold standard for this product field.</li>
    <li> This micro trimmer is quite a bit better than some of the other ones I have bought. I always rise it after using and I have not had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect product to groom eyebrows, sideburns, nostrils, and ears. Comes with all attachments and a pouch.</li>
    <li> Helps me keep my nose hair under control. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp or precise as I though but works well for it&#x27;s intended use. I was brave enough to try the eye brow combs and was pleasantly surprised that it trimmed them up nicely without fear of shaving them off.</li>
    <li> it is ok. easy and painless nose hair removal tool.</li>
    <li> great litle device. Best trimmer I have ever owned</li>
    <li> This is the first trimmer I have bought.  Works well.  I have it for 4 months now.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt when I trim nose hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I ever envisioned myself posting a review for a ear/nose hair trimmer. However, I felt a need to say that I found this one very easy to use and have yet to hurt myself with it (which is impressive, when you understand just how clumsy I can be). The accessories are nice (though I haven&#x27;t used them much) and the trimmer is simple to operate and clean.</li>
    <li> I have had this for 6 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well and then one day just completely stopped working&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;batteries did not fix the problem unfortunately</li>
    <li> upon a recent heating pad having broke open I decied to try this product. It just didnt do the job for a heating pad. didnt ever stay hot for more than30 seconds and couldnt soothe the discomfort of a bad shoulder. Have to recheck the market for other options&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
    <li> This trimmer is well made, easy to use and clean, and the battery lasts forever.  It also comes with a nice (maybe a tiny bit too big) carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t get to the hairs right at the front of my nose, no matter how hard I push, change angles, do multiple passes, etc.  The issue here is that the tip of the trimmer is not a cutting surface, but rather a little plastic nub.  The actual trimmer part starts about 0.2 inches down the snout. This, combined with the straight design, makes it incapable of physically reaching the hairs that are located on a concave surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little sad because I really like the trimmer -- except for the part where it doesn&#x27;t actually do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I&#x27;m going to have to replace it.</li>
    <li> I have had three different trimmers (three different brands) before this one, and none were very good, while one was completely useless. At this price, this is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had and does the job better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. It has all the attachments I would ever need, works as advertised and causes no discomfort at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer at an even better price!  My husband had received one a  few years back that was more painful than anything and cost a bit more than this one.  I decided to order him this one for his stocking stuffer and he has never been happier!  The trimmer is great for the hairs on the back of his neck in-between haircuts and the nose hair trimmer does not yank like his previous one did.  Best money I&#x27;ve spent!</li>
    <li> My nostrils have never been so clean and velvety smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness, as I age, I have something like this to keep my most obvious orifices hairless and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest here. I didn&#x27;t buy this for my eyebrows. I didn&#x27;t buy it for ear hair, nose hair, or even sideburns. I bought this for my balls. And it is WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> An ear/nose hair trimmer that works! Gets those hard to wrangle hairs cut very easily. Doesn&#x27;t pull or scratch your sensitive nose skin.</li>
    <li> this is a pretty good product.  It does not pull which is great but I have had more effective trimmers of a different design.  I am not unhappy with my purchase but I&#x27;m not bowled over either.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer to trim some pesky butt hairs surrounding my anus that grew too long to be concealed between my cheeks.  Works great.  Nice and smooth trim without pinching.  Returned it after my first use because I no longer needed it so be careful if you purchase a product previously returned.  You never know where it&#x27;s been.</li>
    <li> I really like the quality of this product. It does the job and the attachment it comes with works well too. It also comes with a nice travel case.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Nice attachments.  I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it against but the product has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> My bf and I share this little trimmer.  He uses it for his nose and I use it for peach fuzz on my upper lip and side burn area.  So much easier than waxing, plucking or bleaching.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is a great size, waterproof, and works as desired and described.  The trimmer is a great size, waterproof, and works as desired and described.</li>
    <li> This was waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t trim all facial hair (eyebrows) as expected). I was quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great, been using for a while now, comes in handy. Definitely not a cheap product even though it has got a low price tag</li>
    <li> Does not work effectively.</li>
    <li> EXTREMELY good quality - well worth the higher price compared to virtually everything else on the market. What&#x27;s surprising is that there is no &#x27;rechargeable&#x27; version, (from, any manufacturer).  It uses a AA battery. I&#x27;m so tired of &#x27;batteries&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Cheap and does the job well</li>
    <li> VERY INEFFECTIVE, DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST!NOTHING HAPPENS  I MEAN NOTHING</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco NT9130/40 NoseTrimmer 5100...Just not what I expected; better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of taking care of nose, ear hair and touching us sideburns and comes in a nice zip-up case that everything has a place to fit into...also includes a cleaning tool.</li>
    <li> Costs twice as much as other trimmers and doesn&#x27;t cut at all.  Guaranteed not to pull - no wonder, it doesn&#x27;t cut.  Should have returned it.</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
    <li> This does absolutely nothing. Not a thing..well, it makes a little noise when you turn it on, but otherwise has no effect on your nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to replace my 10 year old rotary trimmer. I figured that being 10 years old, a new one would work much better.  Hindsight is 20/20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to using my old unit...it actually trims the hair. I&#x27;m going to shop for a new rotary unit.</li>
    <li> So far it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. Nothing spectacular though.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim some facial hair as well as my nose hairs. It does a very sound job and is extremely easy to clean.</li>
    <li> While this razor worked well around the chin area, I hard a harder time getting it to remove facial peach fuzz on cheeks and upper lip.  However, it&#x27;s much better made than the ones sold in drug store chains.</li>
    <li> I use it to trim nose hair and eyebrows. The only negative is that it only has two eyebrow attachments. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Miles above the old-school trimmers that have a spinning mechanism, the Philips Norelco NT9130 is exactly what I needed to combat unwanted nose and ear hair. It works more like a tiny trimmer and it works great.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this trimmer to anyone. Excellent value and easy to use. Compact and easy to pack when traveling or going to the fitness center.</li>
    <li> In my experience, its awesome it powers on batteries. But I prefer it to be powered through an outlet for more power. You can not trim your facials quick but slowly so it cuts everything. It still cuts well, I use it for all purpose body hairs :)</li>
    <li> My son is at the age where the hair starts growing from the nose and ears. He asked me to find him a good clipper. I saw these and ordered for his birthday. They are quiet, small enough to handle easily but they did not cut all of the hair from his nostrils. I think he may have to work with them quite a bit longer to get the look he wants. That is why I give it four stars.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of methods of men&#x27;s \\&quot;sensitive spot\\&quot; groomers and this one seems to do the best, especially considering the price.  Nose hairs, ear hairs, eyebrow trimming, mustache and bear trimming...and yes...\\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; areas. I have found it is excellent to do any kind of trimming and \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot;.  The battery life is impressive.  The \\&quot;tube\\&quot; shape Trimmer has yet to catch or pull anywhere no matter how aggressive I get with the trimming.  Be warned...the other included blade-shaped \\&quot;Shaper\\&quot; attachment will nab very thin (sensitive) skin if you are not careful.  Yeah, that&#x27;s a place I won&#x27;t use that Shaper attachment again.  Owie.  So that one is great for non-sensitive trimming, etc.  Anything sensitive?  Stick with the little tube Trimmer and you&#x27;ll be impressed.  The storage case is a good bonus as well.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I discovered through the instructions of a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver a good way to clean the little tube trimmer.  With it installed in the handle, run the trimmer under the faucet for a moment. Then apply just a couple of globs of any liquid hand soap or shampoo and then turn it on.  The soap will foam up and take any small bits of hair and such with it that are tucked away deep in the trimmer head.  Rinse and repeat and it cuts like new again!</li>
    <li> Takes a bit more time to get it to actually cut than I would have hoped, and the guides really seem to limit how much it&#x27;ll cut. That said, for basic trimming it works quite well.</li>
    <li> Thought the battery died after a couple of months, unfortunately I&#x27;ve put two new batteries in it and nothing has happened. I guess its dead :(&lt;br /&gt;Was a great product while it lasted, unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t for long. Everything seems to be made so cheap these days, its a crap shoot as to whether or not you get something with some longevity or a lemon. Looks like I got the lemon.</li>
    <li> Careful if you drop it, the housing for the attachment cracks apart.</li>
    <li> Works well, can&#x27;t beat it for the price. The level to which it disassembles for cleaning is also useful.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, this is the 2nd one i am buying. The first one lasted me for years..</li>
    <li> I had an old spinner nose/ear groomer from sharper image. It did a decent job but the blades wore out. I purchased another from sharper image and they changed the design of the blades and the new one was junk. I then purchased a Panasonic spinner groomer. Again junk. They just dont cut close or at all. You spend a lot of time moving it around hoping it cuts the hairs. I went through a couple more in my search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this one on Amazon with lots of good reviews. Of course there are a few bad  reviews because of the moron factor in the world. This thing works great. It cuts fast and close. No pulling or pinching skin. Completely happy with it. Thinking of buying a second backup in case Norelco goes cheap and changes the design or some thing.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd I have bought. I left my other on vacation and wanted the exact same one again.</li>
    <li> Perfect and price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works too well. Have more boogers than I ever did since there is no hair to block dust LOL Works AMAZING and really good for trimming goatees</li>
    <li> This device forces you to depart with razor bumps forever! It cuts hair then leaves your skin irritation free. There is no hassle for tough spots. The learning curve is slight because fear of getting cut as soon as you turn it on and feel the kick from the power of the NT9130 may hit you, but worry not! As you navigate the curves of your chin it handles every hair in its path for a shave that leaves your skin smooth,  bump free, and in its debt!</li>
    <li> It works perfect.  Strongly recommend it.....&lt;br /&gt;Every man should have one...............  it made to my Christmas shopping list tor this year.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does come with the eyebrow comb/guards.  It doesn&#x27;t show on the front of the box, but does on the back, and they are in the carry case.  I love the interchangeable heads.  I had the previous model and trying to touch up sideburns was tricky at best. Now there is a mini clipper head to do that job.</li>
    <li> I decided to choose a compact, lightweight shaver for quick touch-ups for my son.  The attachment works great on eyebrows and the mustache area.  This unit  is great...it is lightweight and easy to clean and has the power necessary to get the job done.  It also comes with a convenient travel pouch for organization.  I would recommend this model.</li>
    <li> Well made and the accessories work well.</li>
    <li> I have had several nose hair trimmers/personal groomers and this is in a class by itself. Come with alot of accessories. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> best one I ever had! does not pull your hair out or hurt like the other ones do!</li>
    <li> This thing died almost immediately.  It didn&#x27;t work very well even while it was still fuctioning.  Remington makes one of these for half the price and works 10 times better.</li>
    <li> NO MORE SHAVING BIKINI LINE. HOORAY VERY GENTLE AND EFFICIENT! LOL</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco NT9130 D-Finer Precision Trimmer because it was not the cheapest trimmer I could find. I assumed if I paid a reasonable price for it, I&#x27;d get a reasonable value, but I was wrong. It worked the first couple of times I used it. The third time I fiddled with it for a while, tried a couple different batteries and finally it came on. Now it&#x27;s dead as a door nail and headed for the bathroom waste basket. Come on Philips. It can&#x27;t be that difficult to make a trimmer that can out live a AA battery. Very disappointed. Would not recommend this product to anyone, unless I really didn&#x27;t like them. ;o)</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Trims nose hair, eyebrows very well with no tugging.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well. I wish it had a rechargeable battery instead, but this battery seems to be lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> works great.  Batteries last a long time.  Cuts hair well.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable device - far, far better than the type with a slotted cone that goes into the nose and seems to be hit or miss. This is fast, and it never misses doing its job. It is a GREAT product at a very nice price.</li>
    <li> Does the trim job without pulling.  Easy change to head with comb for thinning mustache.  Water clean up works well.</li>
    <li> Wife dropped it in the bathroom and it stopped working, I am going to try and figure out how to fix it.</li>
    <li> I was worried about purchasing this trimmer but it has surpassed all my expectations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to use, clean and store.&lt;br /&gt;- Nice compact carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;- The directions were extremely helpful with tips such as using the &#x27;long&#x27; attachment when trimming your eyebrows for the first time to avoid trimming hairs too short. My eyebrows look fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;- Quick!&lt;br /&gt;- Feels durable and of excellent quality especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons yet!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to write a review for this product . This trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve ever had by far . For the same price as its inferior competitors  .  I Will recommend this trimmer  highly .</li>
    <li> Very nice clean shave did better than I expected. I have tried many other in the past and this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> I use this product to trim ear hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product I have tried and I like it a lot.  Previous to this my barber did the trimming with a small hair clipper.  You received a loud noise in your ear, and because she can&#x27;t feel what I feel, a jab of the clipper to my sensitive ears was what I felt.  I went in for a hair cut a week ago, and the clipper never came near my ears as there was no hair to cut.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still learning how to hold the trimmer as I look in the mirror (all is in reverse), but it&#x27;s getting easier each time I use it.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, and with the timely service on my shipment from Amazon.com  Merle W.</li>
    <li> No complaints and works well...what more can I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View tips and guidelines | 10 more words required...one, two, three...</li>
    <li> The wider trimmer is very effective. It will cut hair faster than you expect from something of its size. The small trimmer is equally effective.</li>
    <li> This product works just as it said that it would.  It is small, compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love the Phillips Norelco Trimmer</li>
    <li> Works as stated...does not pull on hair and quiet motor....it looks and feels like a real quality item...highly recommend product</li>
    <li> I bought this to take care of my nose hairs. It does a fairly good job at this simple task. It is certainly better than the scissors I was using. I would recommend this to someone who needed this kind of devise.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased as a gift so as far as performance goes I would not be able to comment on that; however, as far as the transaction and shipping goes they were both great. The transaction was super easy and the shipping was delivered faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Long lasting battery and does the job</li>
    <li> great for all kinds of places. that&#x27;s why they have different attachments.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming beards and sideburns. Blades stayed sharp for close to a year. Good value for price.</li>
    <li> Happy with the devise.  Easy to use and love the simple AA battery operation.</li>
    <li> The best nose and ear trimmer. Better than the  Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear n Facial Hair Trimmer.  Easy to directionally use. Non-irritating cutting head.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot! It&#x27;s a great size and solid build. The little attachment kit that comes with it is great as well. My only complaint is I wish it was a rechargeable unit instead of using disposable batteries.</li>
    <li> Packaging of the nose Trimmer was packed great.  Ever thing I get from Philips always work great.</li>
    <li> well built. seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> Just got the product. I bought it mostly for my eyebrows, I don&#x27;t have ear hair yet and I pluck my nose. It comes with a short (1/8in/3mm) and long (3/16in/5mm) eyebrow combs, the latter I found perfect. The combs are slid onto trimmer. I decided for this product because Remington has bad reviews and Panasonic does not look like it could be used for eyebrows because it is a small cylinder kind of nose trimmer. This one is a straight trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway just trimmed my eyebrows and they look perfect!</li>
    <li> I have had alot of Trimmers and I finally got - THE ONE.  This trims ear hairs - nose hairs - eyebrow trims and touches up the NECK and around the ears with the second attachment.  This is the TRIMMER To get HANDS DOWN&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Dad whom works for a living and if you want something that actually works - get this TRIMMER&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I like to use this for beard/goatee sculpting.  Keeps a fresh look when I want to trim the edges.  Battery last a long time.  I also use to trim the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; on the edge of my ears.</li>
    <li> Wow Wow Wow. I have finally found a grooming tool that DOES NOT pull &amp; tear at hair &amp; skin. It has a heavy duty feel to it; solid. I HIGHLY recommend the Phillips Norelco NT9130/40 Nose Trimmer. You can safely &amp; confidently trim, groom &amp; clean your self up.</li>
    <li> Item stopped working after one use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the round rotating trimmers as well as 2 similar to this one,  This one works great, much better and quicker than the rotating ones, and it trims very close, its small head lets you easily find those pesky hairs in your ears and nose.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely give it a 5 for performance and looks, instead of cheap plastic which i expected, the blue part is aluminum which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;While its the quietest of the ones i&#x27;ve owned, It&#x27;s still not quite quiet enough when you&#x27;re digging for hairs that close to your ear drums, and for that i dropped one star.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is not those cheaply constructed trimmers you see advertised on tv. I am very pleased with the performance of this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Kinda not good at anything. Not sure what else to say. It&#x27;s not good at trimming or cutting hair.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find one of these trimmers that removes nose hair. This one was no different.</li>
    <li> Initially wrote, \\&quot;Good product, but my round-headed manicure scissors do better and it cost $7.00\\&quot;.    Several weeks and after only second use it fell apart.  Saved the battery and the pouch.  The rest went into the trash.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  have tried lesser expensive models and they cannot compare.  you can tell by the sound and feel of this unit that it is well constructed.  i particularly like the fact that the head can be rinsed under water while it is running as this seems to clear any particles and keep the unit ready for the next use.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a gem to use.It cuts unwanted hair cleanly and painlessly!Great for hair anywhere!I really like it!It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> ..it really works.  I upgraded from the former model, the main difference being the extra attachment for beard and mustache trimming.  I still use fine safety scissors for trimming my mustache, but for the other areas, it&#x27;s far better than the rotary devices.</li>
    <li> I needed a new trimmer and this was perfect with the additional attachments for sideburns and other trimming, it handles all of my needs and it matches my new razor. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> THIS is the one you want. Tried many that just weren&#x27;t powerful enough.</li>
    <li> Decent value for a battery operated trimmer that has a quality feel and provides a close trim for nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;Not too noisy and easy to operate and maintain.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not as noisy like some others. Works really well and gets a close shave. Those annoying ear hairs. What I would expect out of my Norelco for sure. Price was hard to beat...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this pos</li>
    <li> This is the best of the several nose/ear trimmers that I&#x27;ve owned. It clips quickly but its teeth are rounded so you really can&#x27;t nick your skin with it. The attachments are fine but I probably won&#x27;t use them much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m somewhat fair-haired, and my nose hairs are not exactly 10 gage wires.  This device couldn&#x27;t trim the hairs on a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut nose hairs all that good..... use to have a trimmer that had the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; all the way around. This one only has the cutting blade in one small spot.</li>
    <li> Turn it on. Stick it up your nose. Move it about. No more hair.</li>
    <li> Remove all the nose hairs, trim the eyebrows, don&#x27;t look like Anthony Davis</li>
    <li> Not what it is cracked up to be.  The heads do not stay on well. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> works great, very powerful and sturdy.  Glad I chose this one.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use, best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> Not the best nose hair trimmer but it&#x27;s great for sideburns, eyebrows, and even a beard trim to save from shaving another day or two.  And remember it&#x27;s just a wive&#x27;s tale that it will grow back thicker and darker.</li>
    <li> For those elderly among us who must mow our nose and ears of unwanted hair growth regularly, this does the trick.  Great old man tool.</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I did so because it had good reviews. I figured &amp;#34;just another trimmer&amp;#34;. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a fan of the design. It really only seems to function its best when swiped in one direction. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to function well if not held at *exactly* the right cutting-angle relative to the hair-bearing surface.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times, but it&#x27;s the best micro-trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. It beats the micro touch hands down. It&#x27;s much more robust and cuts hair much better. It takes a slight bit of technique to get it right but once you do it really grinds up the hairs. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I&#x27;d like but it doesn&#x27;t leave much more than a slight stubble. Be careful with the wide attachment. It nicked me a couple of times and drew blood.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband after reading the reviews on many similar products, and seeing the great reviews on this one. My husband says its terrific, does the job without any tugging or pulling and that its very light weight and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I bought it about a couple of months back. I had another nose hair trimmer (the rotary one). Ouch! that was painful experience. Also that would get stuck with a little stubborn stub. This one is different design and it it works wonder. I love it. No more ouch! Also good with neck trimming. 5 Starts!</li>
    <li> Bought this about a month ago. Used it 3-4 times and it&#x27;s broken. Two of the attachments work and one does not.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and after less than two months of infrequent use, the main trimmer blade simply stopped working. The secondary attachment continued to work just fine, however. Since it is a relatively inexpensive item, I decided maybe it had gotten damaged in my suitcase during travel, so I  bought another one. The second one arrived and this time the main trimmer blade simply did not work from the get go. Again, the secondary included trimmer head worked just fine. But I did not need a mini beard trimmer! I needed a nose hair trimmer as advertised.  So, thought it is a cool looking item, and feels great in the hand, and though, while it still worked, the first one was really great to use, I had to return both of them. (Only got a refund on the second one.) Really puzzled as to how something could simply refuse to work out of the box like the second one did.  I did try about two dozen times to place and replace the main trimmer head to see if the rotating inner portion from the motor would catch, but both of these steadfastly refused to work.  Looking for a replacement now.  Anyone got any ideas of competing products that are similar and that work?  Really disappointed by this experience. And did not want to roll the dice a third time in hopes of getting a unit that actually worked. Tried looking online to see if anyone had reported this problem and had a fix that I was overlooking but did not find anything.  Had to move on.....</li>
    <li> Theis product is excellent. It does not pinch or drag and is extremely efficient. It does thre job I wanted.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is average, but I was after a true precision trimmer - which this clearly is not.  The build quality seems good, and it does perform it&#x27;s basic function, but definitely can not create precision trim styles.  It&#x27;s simply doesn&#x27;t cut close enough nor is it easy to maneuver.</li>
    <li> The case and attachments are a nice touch. Trimmer works very well, and is easy to clean. The rubberized grip is nice as well and makes it easy to hold without dropping. Similar trimmers opt for a fake chrome/metallic finish on the plastic that can make them difficult to hang onto with prolonged use. This is a good choice for a trimmer.  Looks and feels like a premium product but with a much more affordable price.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this trimer, it is light weight, looks nice and even works well!&lt;br /&gt;One of the better small trimers I have had. comes with a case, and even a battery.&lt;br /&gt; would like one that&#x27;s just a bit bigger with making it a heavy and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;maybe one that takes two AA Batts, with just a lille larger trimer!</li>
    <li> never leave home without it</li>
    <li> Great product works well and great for the price couldn&#x27;t ask for better not as close as I wanted to the skin but most razors like this don&#x27;t go close but Deff does the job</li>
    <li> This is a solidly-built little trimmer, and it works for my neckline and beard; neat lines, easily to hold and manipulate, and straightforward to clean.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought. It comes with all you need and with a nice bag to hold everything. Nice design, very modern.</li>
    <li> My husband received this product as a Christmas Gift. (He asked for one!) His older one was not reliable and did not work well when it did work. He uses this product to trim his nose hair, sideburns, eyebrows, and hairline between haircuts. He loves the attachments and states it is the best one he has ever owned. It isn&#x27;t really expensive and works really well. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Trimmer works great! Thanks</li>
    <li> Got to my place in two days after I ordered it. Extremely impressed, works well. The trimmer itself is great and quiet. Comes with guards for trimming.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer!  I had an older rotary style trimmer but it never worked very good.  With one of the attachments, this one works good on eyebrows too.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> Nose Hair: 0&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: 1</li>
    <li> Works great for me, I use it once a month for nose hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve found out there. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I  only gave it star for it&#x27;s prettiness, but it failed to work. Not sure if it was just my luck to get a lemon.</li>
    <li> Cuts close, neatly and bluntly leaving no sharp hair tips. Really good product.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> One needs to maneuver the head more deftly than the rotary ones, but much quicker and complete once you get the knack.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was nice, light and simple to use. Doesn&#x27;t snag hair or cause pain.</li>
    <li> Keeps everything trimmed really nicely. Safe. Easy to use. Comfortable grip. I&#x27;ve had mine for nearly two years and have changed the batteries. It still works as well as it did when I received it on day one...</li>
    <li> Used to use a $5 one for a long time, bought at a convience store and took 1 AAA battery but it broke. The Norelco is a beast of an ear-hair clipping machine!</li>
    <li> Excellent  product very happy with it.</li>
    <li> If you use this one along with a good round style trimmer you can get the job done. Basically, this works like a hedge trimmer but If you have middle-eastern style nose hairs stick with wire cutters or tin snips as this will jam like a lawn mower running over a tree stump. If you don&#x27;t pick your nose regularly you will get it gummed up so inspect &amp; remove loogie&#x27;s as necessary before using.</li>
    <li> I got this mostly for nose and ear hair.  While it has not snagged any hair or inflicted any pain, it seems to take several passes to actually cut the hair.  So eventually it does the job, but not as neatly, or cleanly or as quickly as I would have thought.</li>
    <li> very good function. easy operation</li>
    <li> Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I have used several nose &amp; ear trimmers over the years, but I think this one is the best so far. It really does a pretty nice and painless job on both nose and ear hair, plus it seems to be easy on the battery. There is a small learning curve to using it effectively, but I soon was able to use it quickly with confidence. I have tried the &amp;#34;attachments&amp;#34; a couple of times to trim my moustache and eyebrows--these work in a pinch (such as when traveling), but I have a dedicated moustache trimmer that I prefer for home use, although it is more bulky. This Philips Norelco product has a solid feel, is relatively quiet, and handles the basic job of nose and ear grooming very well.</li>
    <li> This is not a good nose hair trimmer. Barely gets anything. But it is a good hair trimmer (e.g., sideburns).</li>
    <li> It is good looking trimmer but main problem is that the blade is on one side. So it is tough to use and it takes hell lot of time.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, works as advertised,far better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.Light weight very quite and works very efficiently.I don&#x27;t think you can find a better trimmer for the same price.</li>
    <li> It does a great job everywhere. It would be better if it had a LED light to help see better.</li>
    <li> excellent product and service</li>
    <li> I read all of the Amazon customer reviews and made my selection. I was not disappointed. This a great trimmer!</li>
    <li> Works great! Very pleased with this item. This is a great sticking stuffer! I would purchase this for all the men in my family !</li>
    <li> Works great.better than what I have gotten before. can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of the product.works good with tight places</li>
    <li> everything as described and nicely shipped! Very Fine product in a good price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good to have the travel bag to carry along with</li>
    <li> The problem I have with this is that the trimmer isn&#x27;t the greatest. It&#x27;s hard to get those nose hairs. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again or tell anyone else to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product.  I&#x27;ve had the traditional hole in the center nose trimmers for years, and they took a long time to use and sometimes missed hairs.  This trimmer is FAST and it gets them all.  After reading reviews, I was worried that this trimmer might be too strong and might hurt the inside of my nose.  It hasn&#x27;t.  Faster and more efficient that traditional trimmers.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It hardly catches any of the nose hairs as its blades are only&lt;br /&gt;on one miniscule vertical section.  To me, it&#x27;s useless!  My&lt;br /&gt;manual scissors do better!</li>
    <li> Would not cut anything!! Nose hair,eyebrows, ear hair.  I do have thick hair but it was bad in that it really wouldn&#x27;t cut anything it was designed for.</li>
    <li> Having read several reviews, I expect this product to suddenly stop working.  Nonetheless, it performs the trimming job I expected.</li>
    <li> This product sells for more than most trimmers, but it&#x27;s worth the difference. I&#x27;ve tried at least five or six different brands over the years and this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> This sturdy hair trimmer, though advertised for men, is a perfect tool for women to hold in their purse or overnight bag. Quickly and neatly clips those facial hairs that pop out at the wrong times. (smile)</li>
    <li> Works great on nose and ear hair - gets it all cut close. No pain, nicks, etc. Eyebrow trimmer works well but be sure to read the instructions first. Also works very well for cleaning up my beard, mustache, and sideburn line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had 3 other hair trimmers and this is the best of all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several trimmers and have generally been dissatisfied with both function and durability. I can&#x27;t really tell yet how long this one will last, but I&#x27;m impressed with how well it works and it seems to be built better than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to follow the instructions and rinse the blade under running water while the blade is running, especially after nose trimming. But after several uses over several weeks, I&#x27;m seeing no problems.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to use this to trim the ear hairs, bridge of nose, and under chin of my little dog... I know my husband will be able to use it for his ear/nose hair and I&#x27;ll be able to use it to &amp;#34;clen upo his neck line.</li>
    <li> This trimmer seems ok at this point in time. Not unhappy that I bought it. My only comment is that the cutting area is on one side and this is different than the one I was replacing so it is just different. Will update as time goes on.</li>
    <li> Best thing to trim your ball hair with!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it! It is really sturdy and easy to use. He likes it because the attachment for trimming nose hairs is not your typical cylinder that spins, it is an actual blade with guard.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like described! Love it</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works great, never feel a pull or pinch or anything!  Great accessories to make cleanup easy!</li>
    <li> Dead battery included with product.  New battery actuates the device but it does not work to trim nose hairs.  It is not possible to put the oddly shaped tip in one&#x27;s nostril and against the hairs to be trimmed. I gave up trying to use it and discarded it.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll add my raves to the list. My previous nose hair trimmer felt like it was yanking out each hair, one by one. The process was slow and painful. This trimmer is smooth, quick, easy and painless. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Gives me a decently close trim. Even throughout and nose trimmer is clutch.</li>
    <li> Far exceeded my expectations for a battery run clipper. Doesn&#x27;t grab, pinch, or pull hair, it cuts cleanly.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a pretty good job where ever you use it.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this is a much better product than one from another maker, better quality materials and easier to use. And I prefer this design over those &amp;#34;spin and pull/cut&amp;#34; types. At $20, a steal.</li>
    <li> This trimmer can get really small hair without scratching my skin (however, I did try to be careful and not to touch my skin so that makes a difference maybe). It came with 2 heads and both are pretty good quality. Though it doesn&#x27;t come with 100 different heads like other brands do, I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a few months. It is very easy to use, effective and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a convenient pouch for travel. And I like that it uses batteries instead of cumbersome chargers.</li>
    <li> I found this trimmer works exceptionally well, trims hair very closely, yet safely, even in hard to reach spots.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> It cuts closer and is easier to handle than the Panasonic rotary cutter. The trimmer attachment works well. Rinse frequently, of course.</li>
    <li> I did not expect too much, but it works great.  Surprised at how long the battery lasts!</li>
    <li> Works great and build quality is very nice</li>
    <li> Works great no flaws other then not rechargeable but over great</li>
    <li> gave to my husband based on other&#x27;s ratings. i wanted the best one i could find. those ratings were completely correct. works extremely well, no pulling or tugging on hair. just trims. he loves it. i like to use it too... don&#x27;t tell.. hehe.... thats why i can say  it was a good purchase. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Trimmer is pretty much a POS. The Panasonic trimmers do a way better job. I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The on/off twist is a little interesting, half the time I twist the wrong way, instead accessing the battery vs. turning it on. I love the ability to wash under water.</li>
    <li> Works well and versitle, you just have to get used to the angle of the blades for nose hair. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Good attachments, lightweight and useful product. It can easily be rinsed. I like the broad attachment for general grooming. recommended.</li>
    <li> Good for nose trimming. I am little scared to use it on my eyebrows. No pinching issue like some other trimmers.</li>
    <li> The Unit worked for the first usage then would not work (no power) anymore.  Exchanged for a new unit and the same thing happened.  What are the odds of getting two defective items with the same issue?</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t trim a thing....buzzes and that&#x27;s about it</li>
    <li> Ordered this product even though there were reviews of it failing quickly. I thought that maybe those other reviewers just didn&#x27;t take care of it like I would. However, I was EXTREMELY careful with this little guy. The first time it worked like a charm. I barely used it but it worked great. I was very careful while I used it and when I was done I put the protector cap back on and put it back in the box. Second time was exactly the same. Once again I barely used it both times. The third time it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I tried 5 different brand new batteries to no avail. I fiddled around with it for a good 40 min. It just wouldn&#x27;t work. Unfortunate. What a waste of 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is inexpensive yet very sturdily made, works great and stows away handily in its own little pouch.  Five stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old Philips user. Even their two-head trimmers are just incredible and running rock-solid for over 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought to go with Philips again. Its styler attachment is why I really wanted to get this particular model by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, I can say that the styler works, but the machine makes a ridiculous amount of noise when the styler is in use. The circular trimmer, on the other hand, does not make any loud sounds. They both work fine and fulfill their promise, but I&#x27;d like it if the styler did not make so much noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it&#x27;s recommended for any guy because everyone needs one, whether they admit it or not. I&#x27;ll probably buy more because it&#x27;s still the best product in the market.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars but it seems the precision trimmer really has to be used in a specific direction to achieve an optimal cut, but I suppose it could just be that way as a safety precaution. Regardless its a great product. Super heavy and well built. It doesn&#x27;t feel or shave like your typical 10$ precision trimmer, more of a professional cut than any of the precision trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  The carrying case is a nice touch too.</li>
    <li> buy this now. don&#x27;t waste time with less expensive, cheaper, or more complex products. Works as advertised. Very solid construction.</li>
    <li> Wish I did not need an ear &amp; nose hair trimmer, but Father Time had other plans. Pretty easy to use &amp; clean-up is simple. Other than the eyebrow attachment, I have yet to figure-out how/when to use the many other attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Middle-aged Men - suck it up and buy this device...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had couple different types of these devices and this one works the best. I&#x27;d probably buy it again as long as it lasts a decent amount of time.  Update 5/2/2015: Still working great, no issues.</li>
    <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;good material as expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;did whats expected&lt;br /&gt;and it was good&lt;br /&gt;i liked it&lt;br /&gt; buy it&lt;br /&gt;good one</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product.  The ability to switch heads is touted as such a great advantage but the design of the product is such that it does not keep the different attachments securely affixed to the vibrating bottom. Simply trying to turn the Trimmer to go at a different angle often causes whatever attachment you are using to become separated from the vibrating base.  It was not as noticeable at first out of the box but within 4 weeks it is so bad that I deem it unfit and unusable.  This is of course just long enough for the return period to expire and you cannot return what is a crappy and useless waste of money!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great! I used it to trim both my bangs with the larger attachment and my nose hairs with the smaller attachment. It&#x27;s very easy to switch the heads and to clean and never seems to get gummed up. I definitely am glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> Keeps me well groomed and has some nifty attachments.  Also, love that you can rinse in the sink to keep it clean</li>
    <li> When I began using this item it worked well then I took the cap off the next few times...the top - head - wont stay on&lt;br /&gt;the base...therefore it cannot be used.  And it&#x27;s past the 30 day return.  So I do not recommend this item!!!</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer. Does a good job, easy to use  and clean..Best one  for the money. Very happy with Phillips product..</li>
    <li> I had difficulty with the one my wife got me two years ago.  Went through batteries fast and kept pulling out my nose hairs by the roots.  I have only used this device twice but so far is living up to it&#x27;s billing.  I have not had it long enough to determine the extra star.</li>
    <li> Great value, comes with some great attachments, and my favorite part- it takes only one AA battery! No more separate chargers and proprietary batteries in my bathroom!</li>
    <li> Easy to clean, easy to use, very thorough. Is this the real life, or is it fantasy? I wish the bag was a little bit better but that&#x27;s what I get for such low $ contraption, and high quality machine!</li>
    <li> It only worked a couple of times.  There was no extensive or improper use-the thing just never really worked.  I previously had one of those 10 dollar &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; trimmers that lasted for years.  This Norelco one worked for maybe a combined 5 minutes before I decided to stop wasting time trying to fix it, etc.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Easy to clean. Plus all those attachments!</li>
    <li> Everything about this is great, design,function. Just what I was looking for.Tried a conair rechargeable thing for grooming,batteries go dead before you can finish.</li>
    <li> It quit running after 10 days.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works great for your eyebrows and attachment for sideburns but for nose hair it was not that great, I was expecting better results&lt;br /&gt;this is my first trimmer so I have nothing to compare it too.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair removal tool I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I received it 9 Jan 15. Worked good until 19 Mar 15. Thought the battery was dead, no such luck, it just will not work. I am trying to get a refund, hope I am lucky.</li>
    <li> Great design and built to last. Very comfortable to use and has great battery life so far</li>
    <li> I´ve used this for a while and I love just how simple it is to use. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Excellent design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can breathe .</li>
    <li> Not great but better than most.</li>
    <li> This little gadget does the job. It takes care of nose hairs with a satisfying buzz zip sound. Eyebrows are trimmed with ease.</li>
    <li> Lives up to everything it says and more.  Cleanest ears and nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used and the sideburns and neck trimming are a major plus. Waterproof is nice feature but maybe not absolutely necessary</li>
    <li> realy good trimmer for this price , works great shave my nose well</li>
    <li> Solid apparatus &amp; did the trimming I desired.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair.</li>
    <li> YES! I bought a manual one before from Art of Shaving.... that sucker always made me tear and would just painfully Yank.  This works great !</li>
    <li> It is the perfect trimmer,to get into the littlest places a a razor can&#x27;t get.Norelco has always been the best product on the market..I would not buy any other brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different brands, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s like a weed whacker for your nose!!!</li>
    <li> With a little practice it is easy to use and clean.  The accessories are well conceived and it&#x27;s fun to use.  A real winner.</li>
    <li> Works well as described. No excuse anymore for that &amp;#34;grandpa Simpson&amp;#34; wild ear hair! Light weight, trims with included combs to do bushy eyebrows, sideburns, as well as ears  and nose. NO pulling or pinching. All the parts come in a zippered case. Lightweight and no cord to get in the way. Rinse in sink when finished. a must for the well groomed man, affordabley priced and easy to store with the bag.</li>
    <li> A great product and no doubt the least expensive place to purchase!!  Delivery was Fast and Furious!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier....cant you tell :)</li>
    <li> very nice product functions as described</li>
    <li> Love&#x27;em. They work super. No waiting when battery gets low. Replace battery and go.</li>
    <li> Great product and very good quality. Heaps better than others that I have had. Very happy that I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Does as expected, and most importantly, offers a good trim &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These work better than any I&#x27;ve tried before (Wahl and Panasonic). Better design than the rotary type IMO.</li>
    <li> -Fairly quiet&lt;br /&gt;-Sleek design&lt;br /&gt;-Attachments included&lt;br /&gt;-Cuts hair well, does not pull&lt;br /&gt;-Unbeatable price&lt;br /&gt;-Carry pouch with straps for organized storage</li>
    <li> This product works very well however cutting the hairs so short causes ingrown hairs in my nose which become painful.  This happens religiously the day following my use.</li>
    <li> The Best I&#x27;ve used so far. Easy to use, good instruction manual, Amazon 30 day return, Norelco 45 day return, fast ship with Prime and easy return if needed to Amazon. Nice, quiet little trimmer with included (1) AA battery. No painful hair pulls, tims nose, ears in and out, refines brard, mustashe, side burns, eyebrows. Some parts are in the included travel case. Easy to work and clean. Attractive unit. Quick and easy to learn how to use it (different than a circular trimmer). No vacuum or hair collector. I highly recommend as it does well what it is advertised to do, and I would buy again. Hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> This trimmer appears to be in name only. It does not cut my hair properly. I am very disappointed with Phillips.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s quite a bargain, easy to use and works as advertised. The setup is simple and I was using it in less than a minute. Definitely worth the money and I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality product.  I use it several times a week to trim ear hairs.  It also works well on nose hairs and to trim edges of beard.  Cleans easily and battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Every product of this kind seems to have good points and bad points. This must be manipulated to place the cutting area where it&#x27;s needed, but it&#x27;s easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs. Probably the best of the three or four I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It was as presented on Amazon.  It gets the job done but the cutting area is very small.  So you have take your time to find all the hiding hairs.  But it is better than most trimmers.</li>
    <li> This works great...really surprised...I&#x27;ve used all of the various attachments and very pleased with the ease of use and transitioning from one accessory to another...Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I haven&#x27;t had it very long and not sure of the durability/longevity. Otherwise, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have a beard, mustache, due to advance age hairs growing out of every orifice I have. This trimmer has several attachments and they work well. It took a long time to arrive because they were out of stock. I recommend this tool because it trims the ear and nose hairs that us old folks are subject to, but it trims around the ears and trims beards really well.</li>
    <li> WILL NOT PULL YOUR NOISE HAIR. Its magic!</li>
    <li> Like many mass produced plastic things, they can be lacking a precision fit--as do the parts on this unit.  It works OK, but I found a couple of the fittings didn&#x27;t really snap cleanly into place.  Also, the little cheapo bag to store the various fittings is just inadequate to keep things organized--nothing fit right into the bag.  I&#x27;m still using this unit, and it has continued to work for the last year--and without a battery change, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> works ok, nothing great, but not horrible</li>
    <li> Not as good at cutting nose and ear hair o other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. Hopefully will last longer than the other brand I bought prior to this one.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this product all the time. He loves it. Great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> This thing works ... gets rid of the nose and ear hair, with no pain and no fuss.  Easy to clean.  Nice size and feel. Seems well made.</li>
    <li> The design is terrible. The head arches back, so for hard to reach spots, the razor head angle doesn&#x27;t lay flush on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even when flush, the razor doesn&#x27;t always cut the hair. But if you are looking for a cool looking trimmer, this ones for you!</li>
    <li> This piece of junk stopped working completely after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> Best trimmers I have found out of 10 or so tried. None have worked so well or been so flexible.</li>
    <li> Very easy to change heads and now I see why it has such high ratings.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer. I only use it for my ears but it is better than my previous Norelco and a much closer shave.</li>
    <li> The best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. Hasn&#x27;t pulled any hairs and is very quick to trim.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works okay. It&#x27;s made a little different than I thought in that there is only one little blade on the side. It seems to do an okay job for the price. It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug at nose hairs when you are trying to trim.</li>
    <li> My nose and eyebrows have never been more trim.  Thank you Philips Norelco!</li>
    <li> This is good to access hard to reach spots, but it does miss a lot unless you go over and over the spots.&lt;br /&gt;If you take lots of time it will do it, but a quick zip will leave lots of unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> Love all the attachments (long or short cut options on the eyebrow trimmer attachments), gives a real close shave on nose hairs without any irritation. No complaints!</li>
    <li> The twist design is a bit daft- a twist turns it on, but a twist also opens the thing in half for battery change. About half the time I try to use it I wind up splitting it open and have to screw it back together. Otherwise it seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> One of the worst trimmers I have ever used. Does NOT cut. It takes multiple passes just to get one wild hair, and it is only partially cut and takes more passes. What should be a quick minute of grooming turns into ten... and even then the job is not really done.&lt;br /&gt;I really had hopes that this product did as it advertised, with the &amp;#34;not pulling hairs&amp;#34; thing. The reason it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs is because it doesn&#x27;t cut either.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given this product a couple months of use, but now sits in a drawer in favor of the tried-and-true &#x27;ol scary scissors.</li>
    <li> Had others of this brand ...less expensive and they virtually did nothing ...  My old one Like this Worked VERY GOOD  ..Then I dropped it and it Broke ..This is a poor substitute and cost more money than the cheaper ones of &amp;#34;This Brand&amp;#34;  that do nothing ... It works but not nearly as good as  my old one ...</li>
    <li> not as good as the Sharper Image one I bout years ago.&lt;br /&gt;butt till I find that one again, this one will do.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. No cuts or nicks and quick trims. Highly recommend this one! Norelco Philips is a great company.</li>
    <li> Good enough, not great at nose hair.</li>
    <li> This baby is made quite well. It&#x27;s the best made trimmer I have ever owned and I have owned many. It trims well. The little eyebrow combs are great. It didn&#x27;t come with one of those circular nose hair trimmer tips. It has only the tip shown in the product photo and one that is like a small clipper. Nevertheless, you can use the standard trimmer attachment to trim your nose hair. The storage case is a cool feature. It holds everything in one pouch.</li>
    <li> Mostly plastic but appears solid and well manufactured. Only used it for a month now but it works very well for trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price in my opinion...</li>
    <li> Comes with a small and long trimmer, which is good for sideburns on guys, as well as tidying up brows on either sex. For dudes who have nose hair though, it really should come with a round attachment... Helps encourage the, to use it for that purpose more!</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer very much!it&#x27;s great to keep your facial hair tidy.Has multiple combs that allow you to get the best results.Does great job with everything from sideburns and eyebrows to nose and hair hair with little effort.Being water resistanht,it&#x27;s so easy to clean.Overall,it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Used twice so far. POS!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as easily as I had hoped. Switched to the Panasonic trimmer but will keep this Norelco too. Panasonic got 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the color, but I&#x27;ve purchase several of these - one for home and another for travel. Great product at a good value.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Arrived on time. Replaced old trimmer that was pulling out hairs rather than cutting them. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Well to be fair I JUST got this thing, but I used it right away to trim my pesky longer (??) grey hairs from my chin. Don&#x27;t know why the white/grey ones seem to be longer and more curly but this is perfect to trim &#x27;em. I am not yet cursed with much nose or ear hair, so didn&#x27;t get it for that. I don&#x27;t have super bushy eyebrows either but this little gadget will be perfect, I think, for keeping my &amp;#34;Wolverine&amp;#34; chops lined up and straight, and keeping them the close length I like. If you register it online you get a 2.5 year warranty, just keep your receipt somewhere. I like the little carrying case too. I bought this because the reviews were so stellar and I&#x27;ll report back after a few days when I have to line up and even up my chops.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;m getting to the age where my nose hairs grow faster than my head hairs it it is ugly. Using little sizzors hurts and takes forever. This baby does the trick with no pulling no pain and gets them all. Has some other cool attachments too to trim other hair. I am surprised by how well it works and wish I had bought it years ago.</li>
    <li> This tool can be used by men as well as women with great pleasure and excellent results. The tool is very gentle and smooth on your skin. We are very happy that we invested in this tool. It is too bad that this tool is only available online. It should be available in retail stores, because it is truly a NORELCO quality product!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for over fifty years and I have never had a problem with any of them. This is a new entry in their product line, I had not seen this before. I have a full beard and this shaver gets into the most difficult places that I could not reach before. Excellent for keeping a proper height in trimming. without any extra attachments it can touch up sensitive spots as close as their regular as their regular Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. a full five stars.</li>
    <li> Great product, great value at a great price.  Norelco makes a good product.  Have several of their devices and like them all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple norelcos in my life.  This one is pretty good for the money.  It can get pretty deep in there, but you have to rotate it in circles to get the blades to contact the part you want to trim.  I&#x27;ve had other norelcos where it cuts all around the tip so all you have to do is swirl it around in there, rather than make sure the cutter is in the right area.  This one can also give you a little sharp pain on occasion when it gets close &amp; touches the skin.  It&#x27;s cheap.  It does the job well.  Thats what matters</li>
    <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I have owned.  I have had a lot of the &amp;#34;rotary&amp;#34; style trimmers like the Panasonic ER-GN30-K, and did not like any of them, because they are so hit-and-miss -- usually taking several passes to clear out a given hair.  The Philips Norelco NT9130 D-Finer Precision Trimmer has a &amp;#34;side&amp;#34; blade that seems to cut more directly.</li>
    <li> Ergonomically, this trimmer is awkward to handle and use.  Also, the on off switch, which is operated by turning the rubber handle, is difficult to operate because it is very stiff, and because it is not immediately obvious which way to turn it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does an excellent job is removing nose hair and is very easy to clean. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of trimmers for my crazy ear and nose hair.  I use to make fun of the old guys with bushes in their ears and over their eyes, guess who&#x27;s laughing now ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer works well in my ears but for some reason only marginally well in my nose.  It is all but useless on my eyebrows.  It comes with many attachments that I have found to be useless as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, well... the search continues.</li>
    <li> Froze once after just one week and had to take it apart.  Works well when it works. Overall it&#x27;s not the best out there</li>
    <li> Works as described and promised, you do have to becareful when using as it can nick you if you go to close to the skin just as any blade will however, but is very powerful for such a small unit that is battery operated, includes two AA batteries in the package and they work very good, the trimmer is a little noisy has a loud buzzing sound similar to a bee buzzing by but is not annoying to anyone, does not pull on the hairs as it is powerful which is key to not pulling or tugging on the hairs, I bought this trimmer for my husband as he was using scissors to trim his mustache and nose hairs and also some eyebrow hairs this concerned me when he used this especially around his nose and eyes so this is why I chose to purchase this product and am very pleased with it, he is also happy with the trimmer, would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this. It is much sturdier than cheaper versions. He is very wary of accidentally cutting himself, but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem, and he hasn&#x27;t had any issue with skin pinching either.</li>
    <li> Overall a good trimmer but a few things are annoying. First of all when I first tried to use it I couldn&#x27;t figure how to turn it on. There were no visible markings for an on off switch. Finally I saw it on the black rubber part. You twist the upper part to turn it off and on. This is also how you put the batteries in so if when you twist it to turn it on, you twist too far... the  bottom battery cover falls off. Would prefer an on off button to push.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Finally, a small nose/ear trimmer that actually works!</li>
    <li> gets the job done, and ladies happy to see me nicely groomed  :)</li>
    <li> Works okay for trimming nose hair. You have to go around and around many times to get all the hairs.</li>
    <li> The 90 deg. attachment works perfectly.  The little angled precision trimmer attachment does&#x27;t trim quite as well.  It takes me a little work to get it to cut all of the hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using one of the Sharper Image-type barrel trimmers (the round one about the thickness of a pencil with the revolving blade inside).  This unit is well-made and feels good in the hand, but for me it just didn&#x27;t trim my nose and ear hair as well as the other style, so I gave this one away and went back to the Sharper Image unit.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Works great on ears and nose. Haven&#x27;t tried out the other attachments, though. Count me as a happy purchaser!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this product thought I would give it a try, I have been very happy with the results so far. I have had it about three weeks and find it sure does help to get rid of the unwanted hair. It is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull and the attachments do an excellent job. I&#x27;m still using the original battery.</li>
    <li> Good. Used more than an year. no issues</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly to Australia and love the ease of use of the Philips Norelco nosetrimmer. Highly recommend!  :D</li>
    <li> Had for over a year and still going strong, my hubby loves it. It is quick, painless and easy.</li>
    <li> This works well for my ears and nose hair!</li>
    <li> good quality, my bf has very tough hair but this thing can take it out very easy</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer, but to be honest its not the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I got this to replace an older nose hair trimmer.  This one is more versatile and can be used for more than just nose hairs, but in my experience it doesn&#x27;t provide as good a trim.  It does work and its different from the standard round tip units, but your experience may vary.</li>
    <li> Once you learn how to use it, then you will be very pleased. Excellent for the price!!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Wish I&#x27;d known about this years ago!</li>
    <li> Husband says it is ok but not exactly what he was looking for.</li>
    <li> Nice accessories, especially the extra sideburn trimmer. I always liked the basic unit I owned originally. This replacement costs a few more dollars, but is worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this on myself, my Dad, my son. all I have to do is wash it off and it is ready to use. it is great well worth the price. I&#x27;m even gonna try to use it on my husbands head. Hope this helps all. Seller is real good too</li>
    <li> Got to keep the item clean, stop at times...then take trimmer off and forced it onto motor &#x3D; running.  Could be a weak battery?</li>
    <li> Finally a design that gets it! For years I&#x27;ve been searching for a design that allows me to cut the ear-hair that lies along the difficult to reach ear and nose lining . . . not only does this design achieve this, but also the powerful motor accomplished the task in a few short seconds. I&#x27;m surprised that the designers took so long  to come up with this.</li>
    <li> Impressed!  This thing works, feels (and sounds) like a charm.  This is no cheap toy.  I am frankly surprised that this product didn’t cost any more than the little popular personal trimmer advertised on TV that worked, felt (and sounded) like a chincy toy.  Solid feel and sound.  Comes with great attachments as well as a neat little carrying case.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately as you get older the need fro additional grooming devices becomes a part of personal maintenance so I have used a variety of different trimmers and this Norelco is the best hands down that I have used.</li>
    <li> Does what it says on the tin.</li>
    <li> Works Very well. I have a jungle for eyebrows and this thing trimmed them with minimum passes. is high quality good pouch and accessories. If it ever fails out of the warranty period I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  It has great power, and seems very durable.  Plus, it&#x27;s water resistant.</li>
    <li> I like the nose trimmer attachment on this model.  I had another brand previously and the nose attachment tickled my nose so badly that I could barely use it.  The Philips Norelco cost a few dollars more, but I can see and feel the added quality in my hand.  If it had a charger base and rechargeable batteries, it would be close to perfect.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels in the hand and the way it works.  Very simple, effective and pretty solid.</li>
    <li> Even with fresh batteries every rotary style trimmer I have used has seemed weak. This trimmer is different. I feel like it is powerful enough to do a good job and the interchangeable trimming heads are very capable. The precision trimmer with comb is perfect for getting unruly sideburns in check. This is the best nose/ear hair trimmer I have owned and it has bonus attachments for eyebrows and trimmer for sideburns.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s battery powered, but it&#x27;s like a nose cleaning weed whacker. I&#x27;m really picky and I love it. Heh.    Update 11/26/2014: Trimmer still works like a charm with no issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Much quieter than other trimmers I&#x27;ve owed,,,not some light weight fits,, my hand good,, does a great job trimming Love it</li>
    <li> This trimmer has smooth operation and a soft clean easy cut. I have purchased a few different types and this is the best choice so far. I have used it six times and all is well. I will purchase again if needed at this great price.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use for nose hair.</li>
    <li> I had the normal types before this, with the bulb on the end, and they never worked well, always struggling to get the damned thing to cut hairs.&lt;br /&gt;With this, it&#x27;s a HUGE difference, trim your nose hairs in seconds, no cuts, and you can actually see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> It does everything that it claimed to do....Easy exchangeable heads, light weight.  Met all my expectations...would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchase two of these, one for me and one for a friend.  The design is far superior to other trimmers I have used.  I can use this one on my dog.</li>
    <li> Suffered through countless &amp;#34;use-once and toss&amp;#34; low-quality trimmers before finding this Norelco trimmer. It offers precision control with two attachments. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a really hairy dude.  I also do triathlon, so shaving body hair is my part-time job.  This trimmer makes my job much easier.  I also have a beard, which I trim with this unit.  Having a manly beard totally makes up for having shaved legs, right?</li>
    <li> Philips seem to give the customer what they want and a little bit more. I really like this trimmer. I have trimmed my nose hairs, eyebrows and sideburns. The performance is great and better than expected.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this trimmer. I&#x27;ve had many trimmers which all seems to break while using them. This seems much better build and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. Cuts hair great too.</li>
    <li> I mowed my old man hair growing out of my head orifices... I had some annoying stubble for a few days but it&#x27;s okay now that I&#x27;m not growing a mustache from within my nose.</li>
    <li> i find this product useful, i like it, help&#x27;s me remove hair that is in exces, i recomand this product</li>
    <li> I chose this model over several others-stopped working after 2 weeks- would never buy again- total piece of crap- terrible</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to trim up him nose nail hair.  He loves it and says it works great.  It easily gets in small space and does not pull at the hair.</li>
    <li> This trimmer seems very reliable but does not cut too effectively.  It takes much longer to trim than a style with more of an open cutting blade.  It seems like the plastic around the blade gets in the way of trimming.</li>
    <li> Unreal. This is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Yes it works, yes its easy! I really like the eyebrow trimmer too. Get this one.</li>
    <li> Handy tool for getting at those pesky ear hairs. Works well without pulling. A great tool for the price. Try it!</li>
    <li> Replaced another trimmer that broke w/ this one based on other reviews.  Yes, the biggest advantage of this is that it does not pull or tug hairs, but it seems rather weak or just OK as a trimmer.  I have used it in my nares and don&#x27;t find it to be very effective.  Just minimally effective, which is OK I guess.  So far, I&#x27;m not very impressed.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer I&#x27;ve used, bar none (not that I&#x27;ve used a lot) But this one works great, and has an eyebrow attachment if you like</li>
    <li> This is a really good product and very easy to use and clean. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and does a more than satisfactory job.</li>
    <li> Got this for wifey.  A bit more pricey than others, but worth the few extra bucks.  Cuts very well.</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 Phillips Norelco NT9130 and the product looks great.&lt;br /&gt;However they only last about 2 times and quit working.</li>
    <li> I had a similar Norelco trimmer for many years but it was lost when we moved. I replaced that one with a really cheap trimmer I got at CVS. I was actually relieved it only lasted a year so I could replace it with the Norelco. It&#x27;s solid and sturdy. Has a nice grip and is easy to clean (the top piece is removable). Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not as handy as we expected, but does a fairly good job.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple trimmers over the years and I can truly say that this is the worst. It does not shave very well either with or without the guard. Also, the angle of the head is very awkward. This unit is so bad that I have elected to continue use of the trimmer that I bought to replace it! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> good choice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent results......easy to clean  however it was over priced but well made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would reccommend  this item to my friends</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Works for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Does the job both small and large, Im happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Worked one time and was useless after that.</li>
    <li> This worked good for a while but after a month or so you would go to turn it on and nothing would happen. New battery and no change. Fiddle with the head a little and it would go again. I got tired of messing with it and trashed it.</li>
    <li> My husband says its the best trimmer he&#x27;s ever used.  Trims closer than any he&#x27;s used before.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> I was tired of having to buy a new hair trimmer every year, whichever one on this site that&#x27;s the cheapest.  I went with this product based on cost and reviews and it lives up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, trims like a breeze.  Does everything I need it to do quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use. Price was great too. Def recommend this! A nice plus is the carrying case that keeps all the little attachments in one place.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works just fine and appears to be a quality product for the price. The only recommendation I&#x27;d make to Norelco would be to have the nose trimmer blades on both sides of the attachment instead of only on one side.  Having the blades on one side requires multiple &amp;#34;rolling&amp;#34; turns of the attachment to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; and trim all of the unwanted hairs.  This, however, is a very minor issue.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Better than advertised.  Works like a charm!  Get this...</li>
    <li> I really do like the feel and weight of this trimmer!  Phiips Norelco does create great product and this is no exception!&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is great and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It trimmed my nose hairs pretty good but I really had to get in there deep and swoop it around 9-10 times for a good few minutes before it was all clean. I tried out the long eyebrow trimmers and it seemed to work, very similar to the cheapo trimmers you find at drug stores but with more heft and power.</li>
    <li> This a nice well made piece.  Its great for beards, back of the neck, nose and ears.  Be careful manscaping. It will nick that wrinkly skin.</li>
    <li> I thought it was like a little fine precision electric razor for women. This is for a man. I was disappointed when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Does not remove ear hairs completely.</li>
    <li> Works fine. It is a bit fat in the handle. My prior one was not any bigger than the battery diameter. Happy with it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Seems to trim fairly well.  This is my second one.  There are numerous comments about this not turning on.  The problem is in the nose hair trimmer.  It is stuck so it seems that the unit does not turn on.  I took the nose trimmer head off of my second one and put it on my first one, and it worked.  I took the nose trimmer head off of my first one and put it on the second one, and it did not work.  With the first one if I take the nose trimmer head off and turn it on, it vibrates;  thus, the problem is in the nose trimmer head, at least with my unit.  The second one was a replacement under warranty from Phillips Norelco.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVED his so much, we ordered 3 more  for our sons</li>
    <li> I have the cleanest nose in town ,you can never go wrong ,it also has little gadgets that go with it which is nice ,for all those people who have this jungle growing out of there ears and nose ,time for a clean up. thanks guys</li>
    <li> Disappointed, not very sturdy, hard to manuver with arthritis. Kind of sad, Panasonic is usually a great brand, but this doesn&#x27;t hardly remove any hair no matter how many passes.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful kit. Has refined my facial hair care (both desired hair and otherwise). Pointy attachment is good for nose/ear and some details. The straight attachment is good for setting mustache edges and depth. Has a reasonably useful case, though some things tend to come out of their holders.</li>
    <li> Finally! Tried several before finding one that actually worked well!</li>
    <li> My husband has never used this. He prefers little scissors.</li>
    <li> Good product! It does the job. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair like a lot of others do.</li>
    <li> easy to clean.  heavy, solid feel, not cheap.  better than the circular spinning blade.  this design does not pull hairs like that kind.  battery lasts a long time.  nice add on piece to trim eye brows.  does nose and ears well.  would buy again.</li>
    <li> Does the job, deeper and further than what i had, like it better than the circular blades. Down side no power cord. It does the job deeper and longer....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks, but I really like it so far. for trimming nose hairs it works much better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, stray ear hairs, even eyebrows with the larger comb (and a bit of care).</li>
    <li> This is great flexible and durable trimmer.  Wish I replaced the crappy cheap one I was using before sooner.</li>
    <li> Nothing to compare it to since this is my first of such devices but I am very happy so far. Feels sturdy and well designed.</li>
    <li> Works better for me than the rotary trimmers.  I like the variety of attachments that it comes with.  Each attachment works very well.  Very easy to change battery and clean parts.</li>
    <li> A Godsend for trimming ear hair!  Easy to use.  Impossible (so far) to cut myself with it.  Highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> A lot of trimming function is packed into this little trimmer from a company known for some innovative products, and this is no exception. I originally wanted a nose and ear hair trimmer, but was surprised that this quality trimmer offered so much more -- eyebrow trims and other unwanted hair. The impressive part is the real trimmer, a miniature version of a barber&#x27;s electric trimmer. It makes quick work of the unwanted hair. Although it seems a bit noisy in the ear, it won&#x27;t concern a nearby mate. The eyebrow comb offers two sizes, depending on the hair length, which is a nice feature. The only negative is the soft case, which is more like a pouch without much effective organization. At least, it keeps all the pieces together. I use a lithium battery so it lasts longer on the battery.</li>
    <li> Left painful nicks not only on face and underarms but on flat areas of forearms and legs too. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Great little device. Make sure you keep it on and run it under the water while on to clean it each time you use - or at least, usually. This is the best trimmer I have ever used by far.</li>
    <li> 2 different countries but brand performance is same. Earlier I bought a Phillips juicer in India, which died in 6 months. Same with this trimmer in US. I used to use remington which works for 2-3 yrs in 10-15$, perfectly fine. I bought this phillips trimmer, it weighs quite a lot giving a good feel. It worked wonderfully for few months, I would say better than my remington trimmer. But suddenly one fine morning, it did not start. First I thought may be its batteries, but even with new batteries it would not start. I cleaned the head with water thoroughly, dried them and put it on again. BUt same result. Will never buy any phillips product again ever.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I thought.</li>
    <li> it is a good product no problem with it</li>
    <li> It worked, but didn&#x27;t last for even a year before it broke - top snapped from the bottom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these.  The eyebrow comb in the first one broke within 20 uses.  It just split in two and wouldn&#x27;t say on anymore. The second one had a cutter shield (the small plastic piece that covers the sides on the blades) fail within 20 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another one of these.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.  They are poorly designed and cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to find a different brand.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this! It is awesome. I bought one for myself and my hubby. Works great for the nose, ears and even on baby fuzz on the face. I even use it to clean up the neck hair on both me and my hubby. I could not be happier with it. I&#x27;ve tried many nose trimmers and this is the BEST YET!</li>
    <li> Great item, best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> It worked well at first, but simple quit working after 11 months.</li>
    <li> Works great for those unwanted hairs.</li>
    <li> This Trimmer works better on facial hair than it does on nose or ear hair.  I would buy again.  It gets the job done for what it is needed for.</li>
    <li> love it.  I&#x27;m old and hate the hairs in my nose!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is 10 stars to me. It cuts the nose hairs without pain. And if you need a quick touch up on your lineup or sideburns this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Good when it works, but sometimes refuses to turn on...</li>
    <li> One person wrote a review calling it a &amp;#34;chainsaw&amp;#34; and having used this trimmer for a year and buying another It is the perfect description!! The other trimmers on market are &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34; this Phillips trimmer is No. 1. No competition! It runs on AA not the weak AAA batteries!</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer for small jobs! I really have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
    <li> Beats the ones sold in drug store hands down.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is well designed, versatile, easily cleaned, ETC, ETC, ETC.&lt;br /&gt;However, my second Philips Norelco trimmer has just died.  Both trimmers had short lives.  To me it seems to be a manufacturing defect that will not allow me to turn the trimmer on.  Fresh Batteries, cleaning and adjusting battery tabs did not resurrect either trimmer.  The first trimmer was usable for 4 years the second trimmer less than a year.  Post this message on my way to a Wahl.  Bye to Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> This replaces my 20+ year old Remington mustache trimmer that my kids got me for cutting my nose hair.  It was still working after all those years but when my daughter showed me the Norelco, I bought it.  It does a much better job - easy to get further back.  The handle is very comfortable.  I would like the blades to be more aggressive as I have eyebrows like baling wire.  Still, it does cut them after I go back and forth a few times.  Also works well on my ears.  Cleaning it with running water is a real plus.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I use it about every two weeks and it works great. It works so well that I ordered one for my son.</li>
    <li> Great product, hopefully this one will last longer than the previous version that conked out after 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;But this one came with a wide trimmer attachment plus the usual 2 comb filters.&lt;br /&gt;However it&#x27;s not expensive, so why not buy 2, one for home and one for the road!</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell this is the best brand of the only style that actually works well. Rotary versions do not cut close enough for my liking.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products like this, this is the only one that works. Also if you&#x27;re in the market for a nose hair trimmer this is the one, the other kinds don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My header says it all. I&#x27;ve had multiple trimmers in the past. All of them under powered and batteries die often. Not the case for this bad boy. This one will last you for a long time. I believe there is a cheaper model under this one, and I cannot speak for it, but I can tell you I am very pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> Not perfect for nose hair. It&#x27;s versatile, but not specifically designed --The trimmer blade is on the side and not really efficient for nose hair trimming.</li>
    <li> excellent. great for face, ears, nose, eyebrows.</li>
    <li> really nice. wish i had bought this one first, and not wasted money and time on the pos wahl unit</li>
    <li> easy to clean and easy to use. I really like the cap as well. It is safe and tough and a great buy</li>
    <li> Works great in my husbands ears and nose but not so powerful for a neck trimmer. Battery wears out easily when  used for a more heavy duty job.</li>
    <li> Very solid and powerful trimmer. The AA battery has far outlasted the AAAs in other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. The only shortcoming--for me, but perhaps not for others--is that while the 3/4&amp;#34; head is fine for cutting straight lines, it&#x27;s very difficult to make curves as, for example, across the upper lip. With time and care I can manage do so, but if a 1/4&amp;#34; head were available as an attachment, things would be much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;d therefore opt to give this trimmer 4.5 star if it were  possible, it is otherwise such an excellent, fairly-priced item, that I&#x27;m more comfortable with this 5 star rating than I would be with a 4.</li>
    <li> This works great. It is really a cure for my hideously Samson-like nose jungle.</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s power and closeness of shave. I like the ease of it&#x27;s use and its versatility. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my brother who has coarse grey hair.  It is easy to use, easy to clean and item is so good looking you can keep it out on the counter.  It is ergonomically easy to use even if you have large (older?) hands.  This might save you a trip to the barb er -- trim hair on neck, sideburns, eyebrows, ear and nose hair.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> So versatile and runs forever.  I use it for the obvious nose and ear hair that many men do, but the beard trimmer is really awesome.  Allows me to keep the winter goatee nicely coiffed. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is absolutely painless but it doesn&#x27;t trim those rogue nose hairs as well as my old rotary trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found an good &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; trimmer to keep my beard trimmed up and neat as well as the tighter areas around my mouth and nose.  So I have a regular trimmer for the larger areas of my face and picked up this little guy to keep my mustache area trimmed up.  It works great for that.</li>
    <li> I am inherently skeptical of battery-powered trimmers or clippers due to their general lack of power and tendency to pull, rather than cut, the hair.  But this edger does the trick.  Of course, this is an edger, not heavy duty clippers for a full trim.  But this edger nicely and easily fills its intended purpose.  Try it with the Wahl Peanut clippers, which I have reviewed elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found the trimmer helpful.  It is easy to use and clean.  Trims all facial hair and helps me maintain a well groomed look.</li>
    <li> One of the attachments did not work upon the first use and the others did. unfortunately I didn&#x27;t use that attachment until a couple months after I had it. Well by that time Amazon says it&#x27;s too late to return it and Phillips says their warranty only covers the battery. Their advice was buy a new, right, you want me to buy a product that you don&#x27;t guarantee to work upon opening the box. If you do buy this piece of junky I suggest buying it at a retailer with an actual store front that might care if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> As advertised this works great and I like the attachments. I don&#x27;t believe the product page mentioned a eyebrow trimmer attachment but there is on with the unit.</li>
    <li> Cost more to return item than I paid for it. Purchased product because it was a Norelco and I have used Norelco shavers since about 1956.</li>
    <li> This was bought purely on the recommendations that I read.  I was going to buy a cheaper one until I read all the reviews.  It is a nice weight that tells me that it is not just a cheap product.  It works really well and it has served me well without complaint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different trimmers from my local Walmart and also some online and this one by far the best I&#x27;ve used. Comes in a nice little case to carry everything and feels like it will last along time. So far I&#x27;m very satisfied and would reccomend it. Gives a very clean cut look makes a huge difference !</li>
    <li> This works for me.  Easy to clean.  Works well. Optional heads and guards a plus.  Read instructions carefully on how to use.  You have to know how to use certain motions &amp; angles  to make this work right.  It takes 10 seconds to figure it out.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It had the eyebrow trimmers which other reviewers mentioned but the description doesn&#x27;t make clear.  It also has a nice carrying case.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> very nice as it shows in the pic with all what&#x27;s attached.&lt;br /&gt;love the small bag while it wasn&#x27;t mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;on time delivery&lt;br /&gt;value for money</li>
    <li> This is great for trimming body hair, but not recommended for nose hair trimming.  The nose hair trimming head is simply inadequate for such tasks.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my brother as a Christmas gift.  He said it&#x27;s pretty sweet, so I say that&#x27;s a five-star recommendation.</li>
    <li> very compact, battery operated.  I used this on my husbands fuzzy ears- and it works perfect. He used it on his beard/mustache area and was able to fine tune the shape.</li>
    <li> This trimmer exceeded my expectations. Be careful guys, this trimmer will definitely remove your beard if you&#x27;re not careful. It doesn&#x27;t pull or snag like my last trimmer and the attachments are great. I&#x27;m having to get used to the angled head but other than that this product is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is for my husband ,and finely It seems I bought the right one this time.Hes very happy with it</li>
    <li> The towels were terrible with threads hanging on all sides of the towels with threads pulling through the towels. Obviously no QC on these items.</li>
    <li> Did the job with ease,Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, well thought out device.  It allows one to trim nose and ear hair easily and safely.  It comes with attachments for trimming ear brows which makes this task a breeze.  I am sold on this and would gladly and enthusiastically recommend it!</li>
    <li> For the price, can&#x27;t complain. Works as described. I use this every 2 weeks to even out my eye brows and trim my nose hairs.</li>
    <li> After throwing out 2 nose hair trimmers that brought tears to my eyes every time I used then because they were uncomfortable and brought tears to my eyes. I should have known better and just bought the Norelco NT9130D. I have used Norelco shavers for over 12 years and they make the best when it comes to shaving or hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit removes nose hair and I don&#x27;t even know I am using it. A-1 comfort and easy to clean. Also works great on eyebrows to keep them from looking like bushes. Just buy Norelco and you can&#x27;t go wrong. I just replaced my Norlco shaver after 12 years of use. It still worked but I decided to treat myself to a new one. Still works great and you can&#x27;t even hear it run.</li>
    <li> Best Trimmer out there</li>
    <li> It worked fine for 6 months then the clipper blades stopped moving even though the motor was on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Maybe Phillips should stick to light bulbs.</li>
    <li> Must keep this cleaned out or it stops on you.</li>
    <li> After seeing the overall good reviews for the Norelco NT9110, I decided to get one...\\&quot;But wait\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;look at this new one, it also has this nifty little mini-shaver attachment...I could really use a new beard trimmer while I&#x27;m at it too, so...hmmm, why don&#x27;t I just get them both, and then A/B test them to find out which one I like better.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s exactly what I did, and to tell you the truth, the trimmer part on both of them really cuts about the same, that is to say they do the job nicely, and I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference between the two. I was kind of afraid the 9130, the head being detachable, might have a more gimmicky type of operation to it or something, but that was not the case at all. Except there was one thing different, and that is: the NT9130 is Quieter! And I mean like a Lot quieter too, more of a light buzz, whereas the 9110 has almost the sound of a little handheld electric hedge cutter or similar grounds maintenance tool...it puts out a pretty good racket. But lo and behold, I also have this other trimmer head to check out...so I switch em out and put that one to the test against my course week-old beard growth, and again, pretty good cut! I&#x27;m liking this! So basically to sum it all up, I would say if you don&#x27;t mind springing for a few more bucks, get the NT9130, since it does just as much as the NT9110, plus it also takes care of your big Magnum P.I. mustache! And Adams Family neckline! You get a zippered case to put everything in, and it&#x27;s cool it can do as much as it does on only one AA battery. And best of all, no more wily nose hairs in an uproar! Yee haw!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t live long enough to outlive the first battery.  It just stopped working one day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I have had this unit for about a month now and have used it 2-3 times a week. My favorite part about this unit is the secondary head that I was not aware I was even getting. It is a flat trimmer, similar to one you would find on a shaver that has a pop up trimmer. I use this attachment to get closer to those rogue hairs under my chin and on my neck. I also use it to clean my sideburns up. It&#x27;s amazing how neat clean sideburns make you look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a short length eyebrow trimmer attachment as well as a longer length attachment that slip over the timer shown in the picture. It comes with a zip-up bog with elastic holders for all the parts. It comes with a small cleaning brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit looks very nice and is extremely easy to operate. I think this is a great deal, and I see very little reason to get the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update...</li>
    <li> Best ear/eyebrow trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  I haven&#x27;t accidentally shaven off an eyebrow since I&#x27;ve been using it (I&#x27;ve done this with other trimmers).  Easy to keep clean.  Be careful not to drop it with the eyebrow attachment on it or attachment will break!</li>
    <li> This trimmer has two heads, a cylindrical one and a flat sideburn-type trimmer head.  There are plastic combs that snap onto the trimming heads to control the length of trimming for eyebrows and facial hair.  I use it without a comb to get close trimming of nose hair and ear hair.  It works great for those, though you can save time by using some blunt nose hair scissors to clip the long nose hairs first.  The flat trimming head is good for touching up your sideburns.  It runs on one AA battery (included), and comes with a zippered fabric case that holds all the attachments and the trimmer itself.  Good for keeping my facial hair neat and tidy.</li>
    <li> Love this little guy ,shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to buy good purchase</li>
    <li> Works great , and its a Norelco which I have been using their shavers for years, but this is great for trimming and shaping  your moustache , beard ect.... not bad for the price , and better than most others out there....</li>
    <li> Quite frankly it ripped my ball hair out so I would not say it&#x27;s good for the privates. I bought it for that reason alone because the reviews say it&#x27;s great for down stairs.... they are wrong.... very wrong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar devices but prefer this above the others.  The spinners don&#x27;t get the job done for me.  I do wish it had a built in light, but there&#x27;s not much I can do about that.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake choosing this based on the previous reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It looks nice, strong, quiet.&lt;br /&gt;But look at the head, that type of round head with the low blade will push your nose hair down, and not all of them will reach the blade.  I supposed, that if you expect to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; the tip of the hairs, then it does it&#x27;s job.  If you want to reach stubborn thick hair, long hair deep inside, hair in the corner... , you&#x27;re gonna curse, because it will NOT.  You&#x27;re better off with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to use a &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; trimmer, with blade sticking out like this one:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Mpt3500-Blade-Facial-Trimmer/dp/B002D1MZ34/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1GH8Z1KJEVSHSPDZ524Z&lt;br /&gt;I had one similar, but for travel, and it&#x27;s too small and week, so I bought the Philips one.  Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Again, buy a precision trimmer.  You&#x27;ll feel that it&#x27;s worth the money and be much happier.&lt;br /&gt;(also don&#x27;t buy round tip&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ER-GN30-K-Vortex-Facial-Trimmer/dp/B0049LUI9O/ref&#x3D;pd_bxgy_hpc_img_z&lt;br /&gt;it pulls your nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and don&#x27;t buy this type of head neither&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Ne3150cdn-Battery-Operated-Trimmer/dp/B003AQ61B8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_23?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1394058263&amp;sr&#x3D;1-23&amp;keywords&#x3D;nose+hair+trimmer&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s also hard to reach in the corner&lt;br /&gt;)</li>
    <li> This item works well and keeps unsightly hairs from protruding from my nostrils. It is kind of fragile. The tip comes apart and is difficult to put back together.</li>
    <li> A few years ago (OK, maybe 25 years ago), I happened to see one of these and laughed at how ridiculous it is. Flash forward not too many years and I have long dark nose hairs peeking out of my nostrils. And, I have enough soft, furry hair on my ears that I may actually be part werewolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of these and this one works great. It is comfortable, and, because of the curve, it is easy to manipulate in the nose and on the ears. Yeah, I will never be a fashion model, but I look a lot better without the nose and ear hairs.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer!  It pretty much does it all, and does it well!  If you try it, I think you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I like it so far (I&#x27;ve liked others too but it depends on how well they function long term).  Did have one hiccup not starting the other day so hopefully it wasn&#x27;t a bad intermittent connection.  Plenty of functions.  Trims hard to reach places easily.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve owned this brand. It turned out to be a great buy! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Thank you Norelco for a finely engineered product. Easy trimming anywhere on my body, shaving a little or getting a clean shave. The safety trimmer does a decent job with few nicks. The larger trimmer does a quick precise cut. The on/off, the size and shape are just right for ease and a sense of being sturdy. Simple to clean and to change heads.</li>
    <li> Worked great at first.  Best trimmer I ever had...then it died in a couple of months.  I think the blades in the trim head meshed so they would not move.  Sounded like it was tryjng .  when I turned it on...but no dice.  Cleaned it, WD40&#x27;d it, new batteries...nothing worked.  A shame...would be a great device if it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This product works great! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very nice - does the job well and without pain.</li>
    <li> This might be the best $8 I ever spent.  I love this thing.  It has excellent attachments and it works great!  I would recommend this to anyone.  Terrific buy and I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> As a start, they mentioned on the box &amp;#34;guaranteed no pulling&amp;#34; and they mean it, I was a little hesitated at the start while I was sticking it in my nose, after 30 seconds I became so confident I even stick it and move randomly knowing that I won&#x27;t feel anything, removes the hair easily and fast, it&#x27;s really well made, washed under running water, easy to change the the attachments, battery included along with all of the needed attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone is annoyed from his nose hair, just buy this and enjoy.</li>
    <li> Quick service for a really great produce...easy to use and can be depended on to do the job every time.</li>
    <li> Nose hairs. Ear hairs. Chin hairs. Ah, the joys of aging, merrily displayed in gross coarse black hairs sticking out in odd places. Maybe it&#x27;s silly to be embarrassed, but I am and I&#x27;m not the only one. Based on other reviews, I bought this gadget. Just used it and it works great. Really great. Get one. You won&#x27;t be sorry. Pretty satisfying to see those gross coarse black hairs chewed up and spit out.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco Trimmer its a real good machine I haven&#x27;t get any problems with it, I replace  my old Conair trimmer now I can feel the difference</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best little groomer I have had since having to deal with excessive nose and EAR hair...and that has been a long time.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer. I paid $40 at Sharper Image for my last trimmer and it just didn&#x27;t do the job.  This one is great and the price is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of the rotating head versions of nosehair clippers, all with spotty results and they take forever.  This thing attacks nose hair like Homer Simpson in a donut shop.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> works great...very easy to use and clean. I have never tried this style for trimming nose hairs but I am very pleased with it. Edges well too.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do.  I bought this expecting a lot from Phillips Norelco, but ways disappointed.  It works but not as great or as fast as you read it does.  Works great for cleaning up the hairs around your ears but it doesn&#x27;t do nose hairs all that great (at least not for me).  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is not one of those crappy gimmick trimmers that pull or don&#x27;t cut.  easy to use for nose and ear hair, which are my toughest issues.  just twirl it around and listen for the cutting sound when hairs get in the trimmer.  you&#x27;ll know when your finished when the staticky cutting sound stops.  I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of months on the same battery; cleaned the head (pop it off first), and waited for it to dry before re-mounting, and it works fine.  Note: I&#x27;m back to scissors for my eyebrows, because I can&#x27;t seem to get this to do what I want on them.  That may be me, but I don&#x27;t care.  The nose and ears are the main thing and this works GREAT, so it get 5-stars from me.</li>
    <li> I do hair art on my friends with this thing and it&#x27;s still going strong after five months. It cuts through pretty much anything, including face scruff. I haven&#x27;t tried it on thick wiry hair (african, islander), though.  The battery lasts a lot longer than you&#x27;d expect. (you should probably keep it oiled)</li>
    <li> when I saw all the good reviews I though this would work but it didnt, broke within a week. Tried new batterys but did not work very disappointed.</li>
    <li> So far it works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a nose hair trimmer and I got what I expected plus the 2nd attachment shape.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s true, this one doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair nose so it&#x27;s amazing you don&#x27;t feel nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;I love it came with a nice deluxe storage case.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first trimmer so I can&#x27;t compare vs other brands or models.&lt;br /&gt;This one is perfect and I recommended</li>
    <li> This product does a great job. I thought for the money it would be cheaply made. I was wrong. It actually arrived before the stated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Very nice small trimmer, great for removing paint brushes from ears, really does a great job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this item get highly rated. I used it three times and now it&#x27;s dead. THREE TIMES! Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I love it. No pain! Works great. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used. You need to get this one. I&#x27;m a happy fella.</li>
    <li> I was reading some of the reviews on here good and bad and decided to give it a try. Needless to say very very worth it. If your looking for a cheap trimmer this is one for you!</li>
    <li> Best groomer I have ever owned.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Just received mine today and tried it out for the first time.  I have used everything from scissors to manual and battery powered nose hair trimmers with varying success- none seemed to be &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; until I tried this &amp;#34;Precision Trimmer&amp;#34;.  This effortlessly and painlessly trims nose hair right down to the surface!  There really is no &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34;, I took it out of the box, installed the battery in within minutes had the absolute best and closest nose hair trim I have ever had in my 59 years of life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;  easy to use&lt;br /&gt;  painless- does not pull hairs&lt;br /&gt;  works perfectly- nothing else I have ever used works as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  nothing I can complain about</li>
    <li> Excellent.  This thing pulls boogers out too.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> IT WAS WHAT I EXPECTED TO GET</li>
    <li> This device is working great for us</li>
    <li> great product and a great price</li>
    <li> The blade is not as I expected , but I&#x27;m still happy with the purchase. When this one goes, I will try another.</li>
    <li> I tried all those TV micro trimmers and they always break or don&#x27;t work that well.  This one was more expensive but totally worth it.  Doesn&#x27;t pull any hair and cuts clean, would definitely recommend spending the money on this.</li>
    <li> Some people have knocked this trimmer, saying it was hard to use for nose hair........ I must TOTALLY disagree.  This is the best and easiest to use trimmer that I have purchased.  It works great to trim hair in the nose, ears and eyebrows!  My wife even trims here bikini area with it.  We are very happy with it, and it came with attachments and a decent little case!</li>
    <li> Small and light.  It doesn&#x27;t pull. Easy to switch the tops. Both tops come with covers. The edger comes with an attachment that trims (so the hair is shorter but not shaved..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints BUT it does feel as cheap as it costs.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I bought because of such good reviews, but that was a mistake. I only used it twice in a two month period, and the third time I went to use it the little electric motor inside wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to do anything at all. Tried changing the batteries, messing with the head itself, nothing. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Gets in to all those &#x27;delicate areas&#x27; -- where hair SHOULDN&#x27;T grow, but unfortunately does.&lt;br /&gt;It never pulls or cuts you-- just removes those unsightly pests --right down to the skin, without a razor.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job I hoped it would. Very disappointed with this project.</li>
    <li> I was initially uncertain about getting a Philips product and should have stuck with my instincts.  Not only is the trimmer made in communist China, where too many unreliable products are made, but this one is certain to be unreliable.  It seemed great for almost 2 months and then, just after the option to return to amazon timed out the trimmer died.  I never even ran water over it and it&#x27;s a wet and dry trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve had a bad product by Philips, and definitely not China.  NEVER again will I waste money on something made by Philips.  Try something else but not the Panasonic wet-dry trimmer.  It may last only a year at best.  Tell a barber you&#x27;re interested in mustache scissors and go old style.  It&#x27;s outdated but reliable and works!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband,he liked it so much,nice and very comfortable .suggest to by all men who has hair problem</li>
    <li> Overall a good product but you have to hold it at the right angle in order for it to work effectively.  I had an older model of this product that stopped working after a couple of years that was slightly easier to use but this one definitely trims better when you hold it right.  This one definitely feels like it is made better than than the older model.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this trimmer great value.</li>
    <li> Love it for every aspect designed into the until great piece and so far very reliable.</li>
    <li> Always the best.  We&#x27;ve been through 3 so far.</li>
    <li> Is does everything I ever hope for. Close cut and easy to use.  Sturdy and it seems very reliable for long-term use.</li>
    <li> This trimmer replaced the previous model.  They have made great improvements.  Does a much better job and is much stronger.  The carrying case for travel is a great addition.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The nose trimmer is primarily why I purchased this product and I am NOT disappointed.  It does a very good job and doesn&#x27;t rub my nose wrong.</li>
    <li> Great product, as annoying as nose hair is, you have to do something about it and this is the very best tool. Gets everywhere and cleans everything, no cuts, and very fast. Love it.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am enjoying this product. It does what it is intended to do with ease of use. I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> An excellent, useful trimmer. Fits well into the hand. I don&#x27;t have a beard, but it appears to be a fine instrument for beard trimming as well.</li>
    <li> cut my nose on the first trim and more than a month later it still hasn&#x27;t healed.</li>
    <li> TRUST ME ON THIS, DON&#x27;T BUY IT, IS JUST A PIECE OF CRAP! IT BROKE ON THE FIRST USE. REALLY, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> Solid product, good quality and works as intended. Easy to operate and clean, comes in a handy pouch for travel. I have been using this for many months and wouldn&#x27;t do without it. In the past I had bought a similar product from a TV commercial and the Philips Norelco is much better.</li>
    <li> I had used a different brand trimmer that used a smaller battery.The battery used in this item is more than adequate,and longer lasting.Also,I can tell that the production is very good.The item feels very hefty and solid.In using it,I noticed that it cuts very cleanly,and I rarely have to revisit the cut areas.The accessories that it came with are also very handy.I especially like the fact&lt;br /&gt;that is very stylish in appearance.Overall,I would definitely make this item a must buy.</li>
    <li> This does everything it says EXCEPT trim your nose hair and that was the reason I bought it.  It is also a complete rip off of the cheap looking micro touch seen on TV.</li>
    <li> The best nose trimmer I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well built, thoroughly clips the hair well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as easily as my Wahl did. Disappointed after reading all the great reviews.</li>
    <li> Works really, really well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now.</li>
    <li> Its ok not the best... but gets the jod done. Need to be shaped better to make it easier to reach noise hairs.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband to trim his beard. It works great for him and he always uses it to trim the entire thing before he tries to get a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> This Trimmer Really Works Well! Very Well Built!</li>
    <li> Wish it had a smaller head to use by the nose..</li>
    <li> Great for clipping nose hair! Not good for anything else (i.e. man or woman-scaping).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> As one gets older, body hair tends to become longer. This is a great little gizmo to shorten eyebrows, arm hair, hair in the earwells and on lobes, etc. Being small, it also travels well.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and great delivery. Thank You!</li>
    <li> as advertised &amp; good service</li>
    <li> Excellent all around tool for nose, and ear hairs. Attachments make keeping eyebrows in check, too, with no fear of removing too much at one time. Well made and powerful with just one battery. Zip travel bag, too.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works really well. I would recommend this highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Shelton McAllister</li>
    <li> This trimmer does not trim... simply as that! I had a cheaper version that I bought on the street for $3 and lasted for 5 years and did a tremendous job! This one won&#x27;t cut the hair not even if you pass it on the area numerous time.</li>
    <li> Excellent adjunct to dedicated andis trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great product. I also use it to outline by stubble.</li>
    <li> works great! does not hurt.  would recommend</li>
    <li> Best of class. I&#x27;ve gone through many, this one is sturdy, has lots of attachments (though I don&#x27;t use them!), cuts really well and battery lasts a long time. Nice product Phillips, WAY better than Brookstone version.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes, but does not trim eye brows or nose area well at all, and simply sits in my drawer now.  I use my old $9 generic one again.</li>
    <li> Great item and fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> I used just a few times and so far no problem. It delivers what it is intended of it.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good. Base would come loose in normal, sporadic use. It lasted 1.5 years and is now dead.</li>
    <li> Ordered one trimmer.  It quit turning on, but I was able to exchange it.  The exchanged one has now failed 37 days after receiving it.  Apparently it is no longer eligible for returning at this point.  Very disappointed.  Norelco used to have a good reputation.</li>
    <li> works great in all areas especially for curly beards</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; looks great. Will be used when my other one bites the dust.</li>
    <li> This the tool does a great job whether it is trimming up your nose hair, neck, etc. and much better quality than anything I&#x27;ve used before. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well enough. Permanent trim piece broke off within a few weeks tho. Cheap.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim around my shih tzu&#x27;s eyes. haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger blade works well for this purpose. The small blade is very weak. It probably works ok for some light human hair trimming, though.</li>
    <li> Better than other trimmer in the market</li>
    <li> I trim my husbands ears with this.  It does a good job.</li>
    <li> Finally a trimmer that does the job. I hate when my husband&#x27;s eyebrows get long, which is often, and this little device is awesome. The other day I was so mad at him for not cutting them that I started doing it for him, without the little comb...uh oh. Didn&#x27;t realize there was an attachment, but it still did a great job and didn&#x27;t cut off too much eyebrow, lucky for me. He also loves it (me too) for his nose hairs and ears. It makes grooming so quick and easy. Now he has no excuse not to get it done!</li>
    <li> This trimmer work well for removing nose hair.  It is takes some time to do the job, but is quieter than some others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Like the fact that it comes with a case.</li>
    <li> Fabulos product.  I got it to replace a trimmer purchased at Walgreen&#x27;s of similar price.  This is of much higher quality and does an excellent job and you can rinse the blade portion in water.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I had been using a Sharper Image trimmer which I thought was great but needed to be replaced. After reading the reviews for various trimmers I decided to take a chance on this Norelco trimmer. This is so much better than my old Sharper Image. It has a difference cutting method which is better, closer and quicker. It is easy to use and is lightweight, plus you get the added bonus of eyebrow and sideburn trimmer attachments.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco has made a quality trimmer at a reasonable price. It does exactly what it says it does. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> He seems to like it. However it doesn&#x27;t seem to get his nose hair like the other one he had before so that was a bit of a let down! Got here quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m done with these.  Bought one and I liked the way it worked, unfortunately, it just quit after about 3 months.  Worked fine one day, wouldn&#x27;t work the next.  I thought it must have been a faulty device so I bought another.  It lasted two months and just quit.  These aren&#x27;t battery problems.  The devices simply quit working.  They worked fine one day and simply would not turn on the next time I tried to use them.</li>
    <li> A terrific auxiliary for those of us with beards, or those without.  The two different heads together complement a fine shaver, adding the finishing touches.  Very effective for nose, ears, and tweeking a trim.</li>
    <li> Well made, aluminum vs cheap plastic. Does a good job on ear and nose hair, easy quick and painless. I almost tried to get it to snag or pinch, nope. Cleanable, after use just hold under the faucet and rinse.</li>
    <li> Very nice small product.. Does not pull hairs out like others.. Very easy to use and painless.. Would definitely recommend..</li>
    <li> Works ok, but not as nice a trimmer as I expected, loud, and difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Have been trying some different brands on the market, but by far.. this is the best you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nice to clean with hot water&lt;br /&gt;- Nice short cut (no irritations afterwards, for cutting your skin)&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is great (with just a single AA battery)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus, you can be use it under the shower</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great for all of hard to get to places. Does not pull or gives you little cuts. The eyebrow trimmers worked great. And it comes out nice little carrying case.</li>
    <li> works quite well, nice nylon zip up case to keep it all in.arrows on interchangeable heads let you line things up quickly.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. Compared to similar products I have used, this works as well as any of them.</li>
    <li> STAY AWAY.... Bought one and I liked the way it worked, unfortunately, it just quit after about 3 months. Worked fine one day, wouldn&#x27;t work the next.  These aren&#x27;t battery problems. The devices simply quit working. They worked fine one day and simply would not turn on the next time I tried to use them. Too bad for Norelco, as i will never purchase another one of their products. Time to find a suitable replacement!</li>
    <li> I have a mustach and beard and this little tool does a great job trimming hair for a neater look. Easy to keep unwanted hair from ears,nose and neck.Glad i purchased this product and would recommend.Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Because of angle, hard to use.</li>
    <li> On receipt, I was extremely happy with how this trimmer looked, was constructed, and shaved. Unfortunately it only worked about 3 times. On the 4th use, it simply stopped working. I tried new batteries and everything else, but no luck. I wished I&#x27;d see the other reviews that noted the same problem before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame, since when it worked, it was the best trimmer I&#x27;ve every had.</li>
    <li> Best of its class,  Use long life battery or rechargeable for economy</li>
    <li> Battery lasts much longer than I expected.  Works well in small spaces.  I have used it a lot without ever having it cut my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a spinning blade type of trimmer for quite some time. It works well but it does pull, as they are notorious for doing. The NT9130 is more like a little clipper that your barber would use, where the cutting blades run up the side of a little shaft. A pretty impressive piece of technology to me. I think it is impossible to pull hair or cut. It does take a little getting used to if you are more used to how the spinning blade types work. It does have a learning curve so be patient. You need to make sure that the blade faces in while you spin around, a twist and spin type of motion, of course as they cover in the guide. Once you get it down it works like a charm. And as mentioned it never, ever causes any pain or pulling. It comes in a nice case and the attachments make it even better. I used only the other mini barber like attachment for trimming over my ears and sideburns. Also worked like a charm. My eyebrows aren&#x27;t bushy enough for the eyebrow attachments so I have not used them. Its easy to clean by just running under hot water. I can say nothing negative about this trimmer at all, very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This Phillips Norelco beard trimmer works very well. Ear, nose and eye brows have been easier to trim with this trimmer. The edge of my beard is easier to manage as well. I still use my main trimmer to maintain my beard, but I am able to care for my trimming needs faster and in less time with it.  I recommend it highly....</li>
    <li> This device suffices for hacking through the hair of which is my face. It does a great job of trimming in the little caverns of nose, and it doesn&#x27;t tug or sting. Also works well for detailing with the beard trimmer. Heck, I even trimmed my eyebrows so now my brother won&#x27;t go full-gorilla on me and start plucking at them when he sees me and say &amp;#34;dude, you look like a crazy professor, Trim Your Eyebrows!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to remark on the battery life, but it hasn&#x27;t needed replaced yet in over 2 months of my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, cause the &amp;#34;carrying pouch&amp;#34; is pretty much as effective as a ziplock bag. The guard attachments also are pretty useless for my facial hair type. This is probably just user error, but if they are going to be included, they should be more universally useful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Been using for over 6 months. Doesn&#x27;t do too well on nose hair and doesn&#x27;t cut ear hair very close. Ok for a quick job but does not do a close clean cut.</li>
    <li> The main thing that attracted me to this model was the design.  I hate the normal rotary types you see since they &amp;#34;pluck&amp;#34; more than cut your nose hair.  This unit cuts instead of plucking your hair.</li>
    <li> I found this trimmer to be solid from the start, not like the flimsy infomercial trimmers I had purchased in the past and had for maybe a few months before they broke.  Delivery (Prime) was within one day - beat the guarantee by one day.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a trimmer that was more powerful than the wimpy things you can buy at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;This works perfectly on a woman&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other nose hair trimmers, all of which were highly rated and all of which did not do a good job!  This one is perfect!  Hurrah!</li>
    <li> My previous trimmer cost just as much and offered 1/4th the utility.  It also liked to bite, which hasn&#x27;t been a problem with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is surprising for the cost, this is a really solid unit, and being able to clean the tip under the faucet is appreciated.  This unit turns on by twisting the body, so rest easy, it&#x27;s not going to suspiciously switch on during your travels..  The travel case is cheap and cheesy, but holds all the accessories down with little straps.  I didn&#x27;t even assume one was included, so my expectations were exceeded.  Altogether, this trimmer is definitely worth the asking price.</li>
    <li> Works much better than the models with the circular cutter on the very tip (Wahl was the one I used for 4+ years before, routinely grabbing hairs eee-ooo-www, and bringing me to tears, hardcore action first thing in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that when it arrives, both the plastic vacuum-formed packaging and the manual would lead you to believe a \\&quot;detailer comb\\&quot; is missing, but I notice the product description on Amazon only lists one additional \\&quot;styler attachment.\\&quot;  This to me is a great source of confusion, causing problems, for sure, with customer satisfaction for both Norelco and Amazon.  Perhaps this attachment caused problems so they did away with it, but why leave the packaging and manual the same?  WTF?  There is only one accessory, not two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;styler attachment\\&quot; that did come with it, listed in the manual as the \\&quot;precision trimmer head,\\&quot; does work excellently for trimming hair around the ears, back-of-the-neck, sideburns, eyebrows, etc., so as long as this holds up for several years, I would highly recommend it, particularly over models that have the circular end cutter and no comb clipper attachment included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you register the product at norelco.com, you will get an addition 6-month warranty extension, free.</li>
    <li> Best nose and ear trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. Very good design to reach delicate places. Blade never cuts. Love that it has a removable battery instead of a rechargeable one that dies after 3 uses.</li>
    <li> Thing works perfect. Love it.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer made.The cutting blades are positioned right where you need them</li>
    <li> GREAT !! NO MORE NOSE HAIR!!!!!</li>
    <li> for what its worth.., im happy with what I got....., the battery isn&#x27;t a issue at all  don&#x27;t mind changing it.</li>
    <li> This product does a much better job than the rotary-style trimmers. I bought a Panasonic ER430K rotary-style trimmer two years earlier, and it was doing such a lousy job that I had to stop using it and switch to a better design. This product is worthy of all the positive reviews it receives.</li>
    <li> Nice little trimmer! I use it all the time for cleaning up shaving or with pesky nose hairs. I like the interchangeable heads. Which it had a suitable case, but for the price I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> I had bought a trimmer at another store and didn&#x27;t like it at all.  This one is great.  Easy to use.  Does the job.  Feels good in the hand.  All in all a good product.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it. It was exactly what i was expecting and more.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and long battery life. However it does not cut as close as other trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Great service and product!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had to date would defiantly buy this product as a gift or for myself again</li>
    <li> I dont look like Alf anymore</li>
    <li> All attachments do as they were designed to do - Works equally well on nose, ear and eyebrows and I have had NO problems with the power (as some other reviews have stated).  The price can&#x27;t be beat and i feel much sharper and clean cut with this than I ever did trying to use scissors or a razor (depending on the need). Cleans up easily and is a sturdy device - so much the beter with the low price.</li>
    <li> Item delivered as per order</li>
    <li> Works on a double A battery. Has a lot of attachments. Works great.</li>
    <li> Works very well for the price. Feels solidly built and gave plenty of power compared to other single &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery powered trimmers I&#x27;ve used. Had to give a few passes for the trimmers to catch and cut all the hairs but didnt feel any pull or discomfort. Well worth the money if you&#x27;ve run into bad or cheap trimmers in the past.</li>
    <li> This is my third trimmer. I think I finally got something that lives up to it&#x27;s claims. Cuts without pinching and the other hair attachment workes great also.</li>
    <li> The smaller trimmer head is small enough to get into tight places like your nose and your ears. It cuts the hair very close to the skin line with no pulling. It comes with another head, a plastic head cover, and a nice pouch. Overall a very nice trimmer.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have ever bought. A winner.</li>
    <li> nice and strong trimmer. Does the job and with the extra attachments a very good product indeed. The shape gets right in to the hardest of places.</li>
    <li> It eats batteries faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. Nice product but expensive in batteries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this. It works so much better than the round ones that spin and it&#x27;s more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Does a better job than my all my other saver products at getting facial hair down to a stubble. Then I can razor it off super gently and avoid the razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trims and shapes facial hair, nose hair, ear hair, and uni-brows (if you have one XD).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Its battery powered, I would of much preferred a wired plug therefore 4/5.</li>
    <li> I had one of these a few years ago and it worked well, not sure what happened to that one but I do recall that I had it for a couple years.  This one I just received yesterday and it does what I need it to do (ears &amp; nose) and seems to work as well as the one I had in the past.  As for the attachments, I&#x27;m sure they would work as well but I really don&#x27;t  have a need for them and likely will never use them so I can&#x27;t really comment on them.  I found the instructions to be a bit to much and tossed them.  To insert the battery, just rotate the blue base counter clockwise so pointer lines up with the arrow  &amp;#34;^&amp;#34; and it will pull off.  The cutting head is a bit more difficult only because it is so small its tough to hold on to, anyway, for this, rotate head to line up the 2 arrow pointers and it will come off.</li>
    <li> best model ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I had an old trimmer that I was using on my husband for ear hair. I thought this might work better. After trying it last night I think my old trimmer works better and has a higher speed.&lt;br /&gt;This one comes in a nice case and lots of attachments that I don&#x27;t use. The directions and packaged on the inside of the trimmer and I had to figure out how to open it to put the battery in. I was afraid I was going to break it before I even used it once. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer to remove fine facial hair because I&#x27;m getting laser hair removal, and a regular shaver (for a female) was too much for me to cope with. It removes the hair very well, but what I don&#x27;t like is that you have to hold the trimmer at a very specific angle, or you&#x27;ll be just wasting your time. The trimmer is not harsh on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t get too hot, it&#x27;s not too loud, and I&#x27;ve never gotten irritation after using it, so I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the purchase regardless.</li>
    <li> Ordered this after reading the reviews. The best, this seems to be a faster. I&#x27;ve had others and this one runs with a faster rotation (motor). Liking thus far.</li>
    <li> How, exactly, does one talk about *ahem* personal grooming without wandering into undesirable territory?  Let&#x27;s just say that this product is excellent at getting into delicate places, doing its job, and making its owner immune from the unwelcome attention of small, &amp;#34;filterless&amp;#34; children&#x27;s public announcements (e.g., &amp;#34;DADDY, WHY DO YOU HAVE HAIR IN YOUR EARS?&amp;#34;).  &#x27;Nuf said.</li>
    <li> Did not cut anything. A total crap product that Amazon should drop. What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> Amazingly durable and easy to clean after use.</li>
    <li> works good and nice design and color. kind of hard to snap peices on</li>
    <li> Works good on long hairs. but still like my old Panasonic better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got the new philips trimmer with traditional round top design. works like a champion. no more cutting and irritating.</li>
    <li> This thing is worthless for trimming nose hair. It simply does not work.</li>
    <li> Worked great, reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Very satisfied with price.</li>
    <li> Really works. Read the other five star reviews. They say it all.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer it does an excellent job short cutting my beard.  it does excellent job trimming nose and ears I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Light-weight, easy to hold, battery operated. Would recommend to anyone who appreciates good quality. Easy to store and accessories work well.</li>
    <li> My original Norelco battery powered trimmer lasted 25+ years. Monday, it finally gave up the ghost. Given my previous Norelco&#x27;s long life and great service, I decided to purchase another Norelco product. The Norelco NT9130D trimmer arrived today, Friday. It was easy to assemble and only uses one AA battery, which was supplied in the packaging. It made quick work of nose and ear hair trimming. The wide trimmer attached easily and quickly with just a twist. It made trimming around the ears and side burn touch ups a breeze. My initial impressions are that this Norelco trimmer is simply fantastic. Hopefully it will last 25 years as well. BTW, I have a Norelco rotary shaver that I used for my first shave 40 years ago, and it still is working perfectly. I am very pleased with Amazon&#x27;s quick delivery, and with their outstanding product selection.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this trimmer for how little it cost.  No issues with cuts or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;Stock battery is still going with weekly use months after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up easily, would buy again!&lt;br /&gt;(I can only hope that Philips Norelco has something just as impressive for a beard trimmer...)</li>
    <li> Works well without any nicks. Make sure you clean the tip after each use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many trimmers and this one is the best. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a trimmer.</li>
    <li> It died after 3 months of very light use....</li>
    <li> This NPhilips Norelco trimmer is the fastest/most efficient nose &amp; ear hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  I used rotary blade trimmers in the past and this one is far easier.  Tremendously less hassle.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good, works well once you get used to which parts to use for each function.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Two heads makes it very useful rather than one. Very good team with a Philips QC5550</li>
    <li> Does its job very well/... NOSE HAIRS BE GONE!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item 3 times and in every case, the trimmer stops working after about 90 days. It also drains the AA battery when not in use requiring frequent changes. I am not sure if other&#x27;s have had this problem. At first, I thought it was me. But now I am convinced it is just a poorly engineered product. No more for me!</li>
    <li> Works as expected and durable.</li>
    <li> THIS THING DOES NOT WORK, IT DOES NOT CUT, IT IS WORTHLESS.  IF THERE WAS A MINUS ONE STAR I WOULD GLADLY RANK IT THAT WAY.  I&#x27;M GOING TO TRY TO RETURN IT BUT HAVE LITTLE HOPE THEY WILL WANT THEIR JUNK BACK.</li>
    <li> Works well and is ergonomically designed. Has handy attachments for eyebrow and sideburn trimming. Battery is included. I used it lightly for 18 months, (still had the original battery in when it failed). I thought the battery just needed replaced, but it was dead even with new batteries. I liked it enough that I bought it again; but I hope it lasts longer this time around.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Wahl 5640-1001 Lithium Micro Groomsman Personal Trimmer -&lt;br /&gt;Price: $8.99, this one was perfectly useless. It cuts everything but hair, I found.</li>
    <li> A fantastic deal for a fantastic item!  This trims well, and even has a tip for hard-to-reach places (ear?).  Perfect for your man!</li>
    <li> Seems to do what I was hoping for, easy to use and clean, nice item</li>
    <li> Broke after three months... junk.</li>
    <li> A quality tool. Don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff, you&#x27;ll regret it</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.....</li>
    <li> Verry good for men and women</li>
    <li> Takes a little practice but works well and seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> My old one has the trimming attachment do all the cutting at the head of the attachment, and looks kind of like a #2 pencil eraser. It seemed to do a better job of trimming back nose hairs. This device has a long cutting edge which forces you to rotate the entire device inside your nose. Maybe it cuts closer than my old one, but it&#x27;s more work and kind of awkward.</li>
    <li> Took all my snot away!</li>
    <li> Still using to this day!</li>
    <li> This product was delivered to me on October 21, 2014.  It stopped work around December 31, 2014.  I would not recommend this item  again.</li>
    <li> Easy to grip, wash and tap clean, no cuts and works WAY better than the Wahl pencil looking thing that broke twice.</li>
    <li> it was worth wild that i brought this it works perfectly. i like the extra attachments for like the eye brows and the trimmer works great it goes thru hair pretty quick for trimming body hair</li>
    <li> So far so good. I like this product better than the other trimmers,the other trimmers did not seem to last very long or trim very good.</li>
    <li> Great product! I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have had MANY styles of these trimmers... This is the best. The item has many useful attachments and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> item quit working after a month ???</li>
    <li> Works great.  Ideal for touchups on eye brows and sideburns.</li>
    <li> All the other trimmers would break because my nose hair was so thick, but this little beauty holds up nicely.  It sounds like a weed whacker up in there.  And I&#x27;ve been getting positive looks from people now that I&#x27;m more presentable.</li>
    <li> takes alot of time in mirror to trim nose hair and ear hair im not a woman and like to get things done fast maybe my hair is to thick for this but im still searching for something that trims a mans hair not a boys hair</li>
    <li> This little bugger is amazing... Hopefully, you dont ask about the details of how this works... because it can get a little gross ha!</li>
    <li> Great item! Works amazing!You will not be disappointed, I will be sure back for some more of these, Awesome! Thanks</li>
    <li> It cuts well and well made.  I have had several in the past and this one is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and fast shipping 5+++++!</li>
    <li> My nose has never felt so free. Works well. Has yet to hurt me.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is designed for and is easy to assemble and change attachments. The extra trimmer attachment is really handy and the minor extra cost is definitely worth it. Cleaning the unit is easily done with the supplied brush and you can rinse the trimmer heads under running water (do read instructions on this). The supplied trimmer cap protects the head during normal storage, the supplied pouch is an added bonus and is useful to keep all the parts together and not misplace them! All in all a great buy!</li>
    <li> Great capabilities of fine trimming, plus the different heads are great for a variety of jobs.  I have had four of these types of trimmers, and the phillips ones are the best.  This one is the king of the hill so far.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is hard to use and doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> The way this is designed makes it very hard to orient the trimming surface effectively. It just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job, and takes a lot of extra passes to get the hairs it misses.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Great price.  No pulling, no pain, just a clean trim.  I use it for my neck and don&#x27;t bother with a razor afterward</li>
    <li> After having used $7 versions of trimmers for awhile and then seeing them fall apart after a few uses, I happened upon the Philips and gave it a try.  Great product!  It&#x27;s quite sturdy and durable and has lots of uses.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product. Water clean and multiple functions.&lt;br /&gt;It also provide a little package for traveling. Did not try the eyebrow trimmer?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the nose and hair trimmers, but this one is far superior to any.  It is strong.  The blades cut without pulling.  I&#x27;ll never go back to any others.</li>
    <li> fast and strong. I recommended to anyone who have a lot of hair and looking for something which ca take care of hair fast and easy.</li>
    <li> Ordered this when my old trimmer broke.  This one works GREAT.  It&#x27;s so good I think I will be ordering a second one just in case.  I use it for trimming nose and facial hair and for buzzing my scalp.  It keeps my head shaved real close and does it quickly and cleanly. It&#x27;s the best one I have ever used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. It&#x27;s not easy to use and the handling isn&#x27;t great at all. I&#x27;d definitely look for something else if I could go back and reorder</li>
</ol>
