      <li>So if your new to it go ahead and give it a try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to some smells -</li>
      <li>When my mom was alive, she ALWAYS wore  Estee.  </li>

      <li>Have used this perfume for 30 years will wear no other</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used Estee Parfum for years and years and so was delighted to find this available for a lesser price and shipping free.</li>
    <li> Loved the product in the past however either they changed formula or product is old. fragrance very poor do not recommend this seller to anyone very&lt;br /&gt; disappointing</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother, she loved it. Don&#x27;t know what else to say. Smells good, on of her fav</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Estee\\&quot; by Estee Lauder is my signature scent. Subtle and unforgettable. The scent is soft but remains pleasantly noticeable all day long. If I could wear only one fragrance, this would be the one.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, but was supposed to be a gift, and it didn&#x27;t say gift and the price was in the box.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent since I switched from Chanel No. 4 (some of you will know how long that has been),  I use it very lightly, spraying the air in front of  me and then walking through the spray, so that the scent is a hint and not a statement.  I really enjoy having it and especially at about $20 less than in department stores.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought I was getting ( my error), but is a beautiful scent.&lt;br /&gt;I am wearing it every day.. not too heavy for daytime.. and it stays with me all day.&lt;br /&gt;Another winner from Estee !</li>
    <li> For many years I have worn Estee as a favorite perfume. It is very expensive and not as easy to find as before. I was very pleased to see Estt available and will surely order it again.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that I ordered Cinnabar by Estee Lauder.  By the time I saw the confirmation, a few hours later which stated &amp;#34;Estee by Estee Lauder  it was to late to cancel. although I tried.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep it and I like it but not as well as &amp;#34;Cinnabar&amp;#34; which I have used for some time.</li>
    <li> wonderful have used this for years.....</li>
    <li> This is a nice smelling perfume.  This is the type of perfume that stays on you all day.  I would recommend this to anyone who want a perfume to last all day.</li>
    <li> The scent is not quite the same as what I have bought for the past 15 years.  sorry the original was discontinued because I liked it the best.  Would love to be able to find out if the original scent comes back.  Thank you for always being so helpful.</li>
    <li> The only fragrance I wear. A classic</li>
    <li> Gift for my Sweetheart &amp;#60;3  Always a big win.  Will purchase thru Amazon again -- don&#x27;t have to drive to the store and wait in line...... ships to my door.</li>
    <li> Great price and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> A great frangrance.  I wore it years ago and then sort of moved on to other fragrances.  I like to have a variety of perfumes.  I recently bought this and am so glad I did.  I had forgotten how much I loved it in the past (and I still do!).</li>
    <li> To me this is the best Fragrance &#x27;in the  world&#x27;  and I keep a good supply.</li>
    <li> Yes it did. They should have never changed it. If it Ian&#x27; t broken don&#x27;t fix it. I will not purchase what they now call the new Estee perfume.</li>
    <li> I searched for this perfume on many websites, found this on Amazon.com and of course it was great! The product was authentic and smells really good, last a long time too.</li>
    <li> It is among my favorites.  Mixes well with my body chemistry.  Get lots and lots of compliments when I wear it!!!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for some time and loves it.  It was so easy to order it through Amazon so we didn&#x27;t have to drive all over searching for it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  The person who received it, stated it did not smell like what she had been buying.</li>
    <li> Mum LOVED it, of course!</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of cologne since it came out and I love it.  I get many compliments on it and suggest the women to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Great. Was better than described. Would highly recommend. Would buy another one just like it if needed. Probably will soon</li>
    <li> Estée never disappoints.  It is a classic fragrance that is so elegant and super feminine.</li>
    <li> After doing a little research I found out that the Eau de Parfume has a lesser concentration of the fragrance oils than the pure fragrance spray for the same price BUT that being said It&#x27;s a wonderful classic fragrance. I&#x27;ve worn it for years and have always received compliments on it. So if your new to it go ahead and give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for over 50 years and will not change it for anyone.  I got a good price and the delivery was fast.  I will continue to order this item for ever.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume of all time. This is getting harder to find. Pump on bottle works great.</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume, and much less costly here than in department stores.  arrived promptly, well packaged.  would order again from this company.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she loves it. Cheaper than any department store.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume of all time.  Such a classic, pretty scent.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  It&#x27;s one of only a small few in my rotation and it&#x27;s easily the most used.</li>
    <li> everytime i wear Estee, i get compliments.  i&#x27;ve even had a couple of men ask th name of the perfume i am wearing, as they wanted to get some for thier wives.  it&#x27;s got a light scent which lasts all day.  i also use the body lotion to layer the scent.</li>
    <li> Have used this perfume for 30 years will wear no other</li>
    <li> I get this for her at every special occasion, birthdays, Christmas, etc.,  and it smells beautiful on her.  Great for those ladies who love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance as always. Subtle and refined.</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorites.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any Estee for a little while,, but felt I deserved it so I got a ride to the mall, and bought myself a bottle.  Love their&lt;br /&gt;products, including the makeup.  When my mom was alive, she ALWAYS wore  Estee.  I remember the night she had a heart problem,&lt;br /&gt;and wouldn&#x27;t go to the hospital until she had a shower and sprayed on her Estee Lauder.  People would stop her on the street to compliment her.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance always brings back good memories.</li>
    <li> I love Estee by Estee Lauder.  I&#x27;m often stopped by strangers to ask what the fragrance is.</li>
    <li> It is so convenient to buy from Amazon and this is my favorite fragrance of all time.  Now if only it was available in subscribe and save....:)</li>
    <li> Just as expected.  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to some smells - most perfumes have a floral scent, which doesn&#x27;t appeal to me oftentimes. Some perfumes will even make my stomach hurt. Estee is nothing like that. I&#x27;m not a scent connoisseur, so I can&#x27;t tell you what the different &amp;#34;notes&amp;#34; are or anything like that, but this stuff smells soft and feminine and appealing. I&#x27;ve worn it exclusively for almost 30 years now, and was SO happy to find it on amazon. Every boyfriend I&#x27;ve had has liked it.</li>
    <li> My mom was so happy with this, just like what her mommy used to wear she loves it.  Looks great and was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> perfect. don&#x27;t change anything. love this scent and all of Estee scents. so good job on that one. don&#x27;t change anything. thanks.</li>
    <li> This is the perfume I have worn since the early 1980&#x27;s and still love it! My husband lovingly calls it my &amp;#34;bait&amp;#34; as it is what I was wearing when we met! Gotta love that guy! He knows real class when it comes to GOOD fregrances!</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mother as a Christmas gift. As described and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Another of my favorite fragrances!</li>
    <li> Great cologne, good price for it, arrived on time, will order it again.</li>
    <li> I really do not care for this product.  It is way to strong and takes your breath away when you spray it on.</li>
    <li> This can&#x27;t possibly be fresh Estee. There is no sweetness, no floral notes. It smells like an auto repair shop. Horrible. Not at all like any Estee I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> My wife love this one, because some years ago she used this parfum, but in Costa Rica do´nt sell this version.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this particular fragrance for at least 40 years. People always tell me how clean I smell. Don&#x27;t know about you, but I consider that to be one of the best compliments I could get.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> My late husband loved the fragrance. He would buy it for me for my birthday.  I still use it .</li>
    <li> I really love this Item. am also please with the quality of it.&lt;br /&gt;the price is also right. thank you.</li>
