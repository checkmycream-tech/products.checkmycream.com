      <li>This mens fragrance for the price is actually pretty impressive.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I will be doing business with The Perfume Spot!</li>
      <li>To each his own, but that doesn&#x27;t help the rest of the world understand whether it&#x27;s a fragrance</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
      <li>I enjoy what&#x27;s good and err towards high-quality aoud blends, quality chypres, orientals and greens.</li>
      <li>The cologne&#x27;s OK</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>will wear it and it is inoffensive and enjoyable to the family and around the office, but unexceptional.</li>
      <li>Top choice among the three I got...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clearly better than any dollar store fragrance</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s my soap box rant: saying \\&quot;I love this!\\&quot; or \\&quot;My</li>
      <li>Do not pay more the $25 for it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Happy days! :)</li>
      <li>If more people find out about this cologne and they triple the price, I will still buy it, because I just have to.</li>
      <li>Women love it.</li>
      <li>The person who buys this should not be concerned that smells like AVENTUS or not, because on its own this is such a beautiful fragrance.</li>
      <li>Thank you Glen Perri for being such an amazing ginus!!</li>
      <li>I really think this fragrance is a gorgeous scent.</li>
      <li>I just got this cologne a few days ago and I am totally impressed as well as satisfied.</li>
      <li>in 10 words or less, \\&quot;this is the best fragrance ever on the planet\\&quot; and assign it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>That was an unpredictable HOUR.&lt;br /&gt;Unpredictable Night smells awesome and lasts for about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I got my order so quick!  </li>
      <li>I despise bone-dry, cheap, astringent synthetic \\&quot;spice\\&quot; and \\&quot;wood\\&quot; frags.</li>
      <li>Great cologne get so many compliments from people everyday</li>
      <li>If you want something special, attractive, or unique (unique as in, when you get in an elevator with 10 other people, there&#x27;s a 99% chance that nobody else is wearing anything like it), this won&#x27;t do.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like cloying, syrupy sweet fragrances.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;sfresh and sweet.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>I like it very much, thank you!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably $18 worth of fragrance</li>
      <li>The guy was charging 55 for it which at the time I felt was completely worth it</li>
      <li>But I have and used a bottle of Dunhill Fresh (wrote a review as well)</li>
      <li>There are two parts of a useful review: what does the fragrance itself do, and what else is it comparable to.</li>
      <li>There are many in the $50 to $100 range that clearly swings with the high-value, high-cost fragrances.</li>
      <li>Team Sport or Fresh Sport or Footballist, who knows.</li>
      <li>The reason I gave it 3 stars is simply that it IS good, pleasant, inoffensive, and unexceptional, and secondly (and this almost earns it a 4th star), it is poured from the same vat as Dunhill Fresh.</li>
      <li>This is a nice cologne, very light, not over-bearing at all, extreme high quality.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying out right now.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unpredictable Men just doesn&#x27;t smell as good and has a more \\&quot;old man\\&quot; smell.</li>
      <li>The longevity is also impressive as I get 6-7 hours on my skin with average to moderate sillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First time using this cologne and it is worth it</li>
      <li>The little hint of sweetness in it also makes it good all year round fragrance and would definitely would make a perfect signature scent.  </li>
      <li>After that, it&#x27;s only if you catch a whiff of yourself, but it&#x27;s not a part of your wardrobe any more.</li>
      <li>to late evening wears... certainly great for a evening out for dates...</li>
      <li>I was upset when I first smell this one.</li>
      <li>More often than not, these reviews don&#x27;t even mention the name of the product itself, they say \\&quot;the item\\&quot; or \\&quot;this is\\&quot;, totally non-specific.</li>
      <li>This one is simply... OK.</li>
      <li>There are doubtless many others which are also poured from the same tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>blue tinted one), and never knew that there were more options.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s most likely a Coty blend</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m geared towards, simply put, high-quality blends, creative and interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is absolutely, perfectly indistinguishable from that fragrance, at less than half the price.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell of this one that as well.</li>
      <li>But it also doesn&#x27;t have much depth to speak of.</li>
      <li>He really seems to like it.</li>
      <li>I really did not like it.</li>
      <li>For the price and how much you have to use it, just save up some money and buy a REAL fragrance.</li>
      <li>Now, to be fair, there are any number of other mixes that are very similar if not identical - I think Yacht Man Metal - and an Adidas scent, but I can&#x27;t remember which one.</li>
      <li>I actually was not going to write a review because I wanted to try to keep this fragrance my hidden gem but its just too good to not try to share the love, and also because the other reviews did not seem to be informative about the scent.  </li>
      <li>PerfumeWorld was good as well as they shipped it out the same day, will definitely do business with them again in the future.</li>
      <li>one is so inexpensive and so absolutely OK, in a nice, heavy bottle with a decent spray, that it&#x27;s hard to fault it.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m lucky to have an embarrassingly large and broad-spectrum fragrance wardrobe, numbering in several hundreds, representing all the major groups of fragrances - florals, fougeres, aquas, attars, woods, citrus, greens.</li>
      <li>The companies all spend a few grand paying folks who have</li>
      <li>To describe this fragrance, it definitely plays along the line of dg light, acqua di gio, l&#x27;eau issey and similar citrusy aquatics, the difference being this one is a little sweeter and less sharp making it more pleasant to the nose.</li>
      <li>I feel like I finally found my signature scent, and that to me is a huge personal acomplishment!!</li>
      <li>You may also love a soiled baby diaper top note with a dry down of tar and nuclear waste.</li>
      <li>They are all purely and simply identical.</li>
      <li>I enjoy a variety of them from a few synthetic-based designer frags to the Montales, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, and Amouages.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please note that you may completely disregard the reviews that say,</li>
      <li>So you can see how surprised I was when I saw it was only 17 bucks on</li>
      <li>This is called social media spamming.</li>
      <li>I first found this same brand at the mall for almost $60.00, but I knew I would find it here for much less.</li>
      <li>Even with the shipping costs the price was less than half of the original find.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received it on time, but the bottle was leaking and spraying is kinda hard and feels like it may come apart everytime I use it. The cologne&#x27;s OK</li>
    <li> OMG it smell  so good</li>
    <li> I just got this cologne a few days ago and I am totally impressed as well as satisfied. This is a nice cologne, very light, not over-bearing at all, extreme high quality. The packaging emulated the quality of the cologne itself, awesome bottle even. I first found this same brand at the mall for almost $60.00, but I knew I would find it here for much less. Even with the shipping costs the price was less than half of the original find. I received the product two days ago, on the estimated day it would leave to be delivered. This arrived six days ahead of the estimated arrival date. I&#x27;m sure I will be doing business with The Perfume Spot!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells absolutely amazing! I just want to pounce my boyfriend when he is wearing this scent. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of complements about this sent. Do not pay more the $25 for it. There are places at the mall that will charge you $45 for this sent.</li>
    <li> I bought Unpredictable, Unpredictable Desire, and Unpredictable Men.  After having all 3 I prefer Unpredictable #1, Unpredictable Desire # 2, and Unpredictable Men # 3. Unpredictable Men just doesn&#x27;t smell as good and has a more \\&quot;old man\\&quot; smell.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, thank you!</li>
    <li> I got my order so quick!  Can&#x27;t wait to give this to my husband ♡</li>
    <li> I have seen negative reviews on this product and they are not true. The person who buys this should not be concerned that smells like AVENTUS or not, because on its own this is such a beautiful fragrance. I work with women and I never get compliments on my cologne. Today I got three compliments from women and one compliment from a man. I really think this fragrance is a gorgeous scent. If more people find out about this cologne and they triple the price, I will still buy it, because I just have to. Who doesn&#x27;t want to hear compliments? I feel like I finally found my signature scent, and that to me is a huge personal acomplishment!! Thank you Glen Perri for being such an amazing ginus!!</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells AMAZING! Women love it. I&#x27;ve had women all over me smelling this stuff. That was a very unpredictable night...&lt;br /&gt;No, let me rephrase. That was an unpredictable HOUR.&lt;br /&gt;Unpredictable Night smells awesome and lasts for about 30 minutes. I don&#x27;t have the patience to spray myself 8 times a day with about 7 sprays each time. You&#x27;ve gotta be kidding me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not buying this stuff again. Forget it. For the price and how much you have to use it, just save up some money and buy a REAL fragrance. From a department store. I&#x27;ve learned that even the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; colognes you purchase on amazon are indeed fakes.</li>
    <li> There are two parts of a useful review: what does the fragrance itself do, and what else is it comparable to. A third part, by far the most common and always completely worthless, is, \\&quot;do I like it?\\&quot;. Here&#x27;s my soap box rant: saying \\&quot;I love this!\\&quot; or \\&quot;My boyfriend/husband/wife/second cousin/alien examiner during an abduction really liked it!\\&quot; is worthless. You may also love a soiled baby diaper top note with a dry down of tar and nuclear waste. To each his own, but that doesn&#x27;t help the rest of the world understand whether it&#x27;s a fragrance they&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you may completely disregard the reviews that say, in 10 words or less, \\&quot;this is the best fragrance ever on the planet\\&quot; and assign it 5 stars. This is called social media spamming. The companies all spend a few grand paying folks who have 100 different Amazon accounts with 100 different email addresses to give a barely-legible, semi-inchoate review to whatever the company&#x27;s product is, to artificially inflate the early star rating. More often than not, these reviews don&#x27;t even mention the name of the product itself, they say \\&quot;the item\\&quot; or \\&quot;this is\\&quot;, totally non-specific. So, take heart, this review is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To place my tastes, I&#x27;m lucky to have an embarrassingly large and broad-spectrum fragrance wardrobe, numbering in several hundreds, representing all the major groups of fragrances - florals, fougeres, aquas, attars, woods, citrus, greens. I enjoy a variety of them from a few synthetic-based designer frags to the Montales, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, and Amouages. I enjoy what&#x27;s good and err towards high-quality aoud blends, quality chypres, orientals and greens. I don&#x27;t like cloying, syrupy sweet fragrances. I despise bone-dry, cheap, astringent synthetic \\&quot;spice\\&quot; and \\&quot;wood\\&quot; frags. I like florals but I despise powdery smells. I&#x27;m geared towards, simply put, high-quality blends, creative and interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for Glenn Perri Unpredictable Night: this is a good fragrance. It&#x27;sfresh and sweet. Heavy on the synthetic amber and I&#x27;m really not sure what else - a bubblegum accord, maybe some musky tobacco leaf. But it also doesn&#x27;t have much depth to speak of. On skin you won&#x27;t smell it after an hour, fabric has hints, whiffs, of something after 3-4 hours. Longevity is poor. Sillage is good... for 30 minutes, an hour on fabric. After that, it&#x27;s only if you catch a whiff of yourself, but it&#x27;s not a part of your wardrobe any more. When it&#x27;s fully dried down, you may as well be wearing no fragrance. It&#x27;s synthetic ambergris and some synthetic floral... I&#x27;m struggling to identify it... maybe some synthetic lilac and a touch of cedar? Or is it just an anonymous chemical not really associated with any natural flower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will wear it and it is inoffensive and enjoyable to the family and around the office, but unexceptional. The reason I gave it 3 stars is simply that it IS good, pleasant, inoffensive, and unexceptional, and secondly (and this almost earns it a 4th star), it is poured from the same vat as Dunhill Fresh. Now, to be fair, there are any number of other mixes that are very similar if not identical - I think Yacht Man Metal - and an Adidas scent, but I can&#x27;t remember which one. A light-blue or lilac-colored one. Team Sport or Fresh Sport or Footballist, who knows. But I have and used a bottle of Dunhill Fresh (wrote a review as well) and this is absolutely, perfectly indistinguishable from that fragrance, at less than half the price. There are doubtless many others which are also poured from the same tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s the conundrum. This is a part of a race to the bottom. It&#x27;s clearly better than any dollar store fragrance but it&#x27;s clearly worse than any quality designer fragrance, and two orders of magnitude worse than any proper perfume house, all-natural, high-quality blend. It&#x27;s a race to the bottom... and you&#x27;re as likely as not to get an identical synthetic fragrance in a different bottle for $50 as this one for $15. You can&#x27;t even compare the \\&quot;Afrag Black\\&quot; to the \\&quot;Bfrag Black\\&quot;, or the \\&quot;Cfrag Night\\&quot; to the \\&quot;Dfrag Night\\&quot;. They play musical chairs with Black, White, Metal, Night, Sport. They have all the same six or eight but in Karen Low it may be White, in Thallium it may be Black, in Glenn Perri it may be Metal, in Dunhill it&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Odor, and in Adidas it is Team Orgy. They are all purely and simply identical. So, go to a department store, walk up to the fragrances, close your eyes and grab one. You have about a 20% chance that it&#x27;s this fragrance in a different bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is so inexpensive and so absolutely OK, in a nice, heavy bottle with a decent spray, that it&#x27;s hard to fault it. It&#x27;s probably $18 worth of fragrance but it only costs $15. (Not kidding.) But it is anonymous and forgettable and for me, as a collector, I will not replace it. That is why it got 3 instead of 4 stars. In my system, I give 4 stars to any fragrance I like enough to replace once the bottle is empty - a permanent member of my wardrobe (assuming that they still make the frag when the bottle is empty). Five is a sort of top-25-of-all, king-of-the-hill fragrance that competes with any and every bottle up to $350 in value. There are many in the $50 to $100 range that clearly swings with the high-value, high-cost fragrances. This one is simply... OK. Not bad. Not offensive. Not cloying. Not exceptional. It&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s most likely a Coty blend that&#x27;s pennies per liquid ounce at cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong if you want something that&#x27;s rock-solid, unimpeachable, alright. If you want something special, attractive, or unique (unique as in, when you get in an elevator with 10 other people, there&#x27;s a 99% chance that nobody else is wearing anything like it), this won&#x27;t do. It&#x27;s good. Not bad. Not great. A rock-solid, 100% perfect, good. Good with a capital \\&quot;G\\&quot;. I expect to write nearly identical reviews for a variety of other Glenn Perri and Karen Low and other fragrances I&#x27;m trying out right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy days! :)</li>
    <li> bought these for my brother per his request. He really seems to like it. Even bought one for his friend.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this colgne for men and he also commented how it was a great buy from retail stores. Thank you.</li>
    <li> You can use this cologne for either night or day. Both men and women(friends, family, and strangers a like) stop me and ask &amp;#34;What do you have on&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Wow you smell soooo good&amp;#34;. You think those Axe commercials attract a lot of girls? Wait until you try this.</li>
    <li> I really did not like it. I wanted to get the other unpredictable cologne. The adventure type. I was upset when I first smell this one.</li>
    <li> This is great perfume.</li>
    <li> one great perfume for the price. Very nice for mid-afternoon to late evening wears... certainly great for a evening out for dates... At 15 dollar price range this scent delivers...Better than some expensive ones at 45 dollars. Glenn Perri Unpredictable Night Top choice among the three I got... 2nd place fort the Glenn Perri Unpredictable Pour Homme grey bottle... smells like NOTES from DNKY BE DELICIOUS.... And Third place for Glenn Perri Unpredictable Eau De Toilette Spray for Men BLUE bottle that smells like Chrome legend...</li>
    <li> Great cologne get so many compliments from people everyday I put this on</li>
    <li> I bought the Glenn Perri before(the blue tinted one), and never knew that there were more options. I really like the smell of this one that as well.</li>
    <li> Thank you. The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband. He has some but was about to run out and I looked all over are town trying to find it and no one had any. It smells great. It was at a great price too.</li>
    <li> Smells so good everyone loved it</li>
    <li> First time using this cologne and it is worth it</li>
    <li> This mens fragrance for the price is actually pretty impressive.  I tried this stuff out in a perfume shop and me and my girlfriend both loved it!  The guy was charging 55 for it which at the time I felt was completely worth it and actually he thought he was giving me a deal based on how good/expensive this fragrance smelled. So you can see how surprised I was when I saw it was only 17 bucks on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To describe this fragrance, it definitely plays along the line of dg light, acqua di gio, l&#x27;eau issey and similar citrusy aquatics, the difference being this one is a little sweeter and less sharp making it more pleasant to the nose. The little hint of sweetness in it also makes it good all year round fragrance and would definitely would make a perfect signature scent.  The longevity is also impressive as I get 6-7 hours on my skin with average to moderate sillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll be honest I actually was not going to write a review because I wanted to try to keep this fragrance my hidden gem but its just too good to not try to share the love, and also because the other reviews did not seem to be informative about the scent.  PerfumeWorld was good as well as they shipped it out the same day, will definitely do business with them again in the future.</li>
