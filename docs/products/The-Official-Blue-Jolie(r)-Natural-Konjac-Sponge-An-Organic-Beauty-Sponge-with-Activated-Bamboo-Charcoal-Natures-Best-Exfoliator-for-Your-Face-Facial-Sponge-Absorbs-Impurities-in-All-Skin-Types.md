    <li> I have been using facial konjac sponge for the last 5 months and seen good results on my skin. This is my third one. I like this one more than the previous brands because it exfoliates better and the size is very convenient. I received an e-booklet after I purchased this konjac sponge which is really nice.</li>
    <li> I really liked the way the sponge made my face feel so I was sorry when it disintegrated after only 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend to try as my skin has I had recently started breaking out again! This was a completely new item to me and I was a little skeptical to try it but I will say that it proved me wrong and I LOVE it! It leaves my skin smooth and doesnt irritate my skin at all. After using it for a few days I noticed a difference in my break outs!</li>
    <li> Im a guy and I tried this out to smooth out my skin. I work in construction and Im around dusty air and exhaust fumes all day. I can honestly say this sponge removed months of dirt from my pours. I feel pretty good about this buy.</li>
    <li> This had to be one of the oddest things I have ever washed my face with. I&#x27;m usually a mild soap kind of girl. I was very skeptical before trying this. The sponge is hard at first and once wet turns into a very soft, smooth material. As I was washing my face with it I literally felt like there was soap on it. It was so soft and smooth but w a nice scrub feeling. My face felt so good after. Normally after washing my face it always feels tight, resulting in me needed lotion on right after. This left my face feeling very soft and moisturized, as weird as that may sound. I love the feeling and I&#x27;m excited to see where this keeps going! Also I&#x27;m super stoked on the idea that it truly is all natural and I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals causing me to breakout or react to. I have very sensitive skin and this sponge is fabulous!!</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product! I suffer from both oily and dry skin so I needed something that gave me fixings for both problems. Within just a few days I&#x27;ve noticed softer, clearer, andess oily skin! I could but be any happier and I&#x27;ll be continuing to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty basic skincare routine but adding this in was simple. It really helps smooth out my skin and clear out my pores. My skin feels great and really refreshed. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little something extra to help their skin!</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail today. Before I even changed my clothes from getting home from work, I opened this up and tried it. I&#x27;ve been looking around for a really good product to get my face cleaned up. As a woman, we all know the hormones and stresses we go through really effect the quality of our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is very light weight. I&#x27;ve never felt anything like this before. I was skeptical at first, but once I got it wet, used it as directed, and towel dried my face, I was honestly astonished at what my face felt like just after one wash. My face is very oily, dry, and just....yuck! It took off all the crud on my face, the oil went away, and my skin actually felt nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is that it&#x27;s reusable! It&#x27;s hanging in my shower drying right now. I am really excited to see the results after a few more uses if it&#x27;s already done so much this fast! I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend says she loves these. Her skin feels softer, revitalized. Fun to use, she said she noticed results quicker than she expected. No irritation like with other products shes tried. Will recommend to her friends with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> My grandmother use to tell me that charcoal had purifying qualities way before it became the newest craze. I was excited to see this product and ordered right away. Sure enough it clears pores very deep and makes your face feel amazingly clean and pure. Summer in Florida is a time where you are always feeling dirty because of the heat.. sand.. ect. So using this after being outside all day really refreshes you! I find it leaves your face feeling fresh and glowing after a good scrub!</li>
    <li> I have never used a facial sponge like this before, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised when I got my Konjac sponge and how well it worked. The way the sponge works is very odd. It is a solid sponge when it is dry, but after soaking it in water is turns softer. As I was using it on my face, I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing much of anything, but the after effect was amazing. My skin was so soft and smooth. I&#x27;m hoping this will show long term effects as I continue using this product. I highly recommend this to everyone and especially people who have sensitive skin because of its gentle nature.</li>
    <li> Worked very well. I was very supprised at first I thought it would be rough on my face. It got a lot of dirt and grime out of my poors. Very thankful to get this product. I had a code and I got product for in turn for a review</li>
    <li> This is fantastic... it does refresh and revitalize, I could not believe the way my face felt after using it for the first time, felt so clean, smooth and fresh.  I will order more for gifts.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by this sponge. Not only is it all natural and biodegradable, it is super effective too! It is a simple way to rejuvenate and replenish your skin and the best part is that it is for sensitive skin too. I usually have an issue with many products on my face so I tend to avoid them altogether. But I gave this product a try and I am very happy I did. I did not expect such a difference but even after the first use my face felt really soft and looked great. Though hard when you first take it out of the package, once I ran it under water and gave it a try it was surprisingly gentle on the skin. So far I am a very happy customer and plan to continue using this sponge to keep my face looking and feeling clean and clear!</li>

    <li> I have really sensitive, oily skin that breaks out easily. That bring the case, Im pleased that this is as gentle as it is. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference the first 5-7 days, but around that time I started noticing that my skin was softer and getting a lot clearer. Ivery been using it for a couple weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t broken out even a little bit once. Normally with this new for 2015  hot weather (I live in N.E.) my fave always breaks out cause it&#x27;s not used to sweating and being itchy. Super glad that hasn&#x27;t happened this time. I also noticed that my pores have gotten smaller; they are definitely less noticable. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges.  They really feel soft yet rough enough to clean my face.  Great service, timely delivery as well!</li>
    <li> I was a little confused about how this would feel on on my face since I have sensitive skin, but I figured after reading the reviews I would give it  try. I used it last night for the first time and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and my skin felt right after. I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results. Will definitely by buying more of these.</li>
    <li> This sponge is really cool. I had heard of bamboo charcoal, or &#x27;&#x27;black diamond&amp;#34;, for skin care and was surprised to find a sponge made of it. I read that bamboo charcoal has been used for hundreds of years in Asian countries for skin care because it is so beneficial. The bamboo charcoal absorbs toxins and other harmful substances from your skin and gives you a really deep cleansing. It works really well under the eyes, as that area is really hard to clean because of the sensitive skin, so dirt and grim collects there and makes your eyes sag a little. After using this for a few days, I have noticed a difference in my skin tone, especially under my eyes. My face looks and feels really healthy and  I have a more even skin tone. This is a really good product for the price and I have ordered a few more for myself and some for my sisters! This is the way to go for really clean and healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a young adult (in my thirties), and I still have issues with small breakouts, especially during &amp;#34;that time of the month.&amp;#34; I also have a ruddy complexion thanks to my fair and freckled complexion. I&#x27;ve tried a hundred face cleaning products and tone brightening products. What happens is that my skin dries out. Not only do I fail to see results, but then I&#x27;m uncomfortable in my own skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac Sponge works miracles. It&#x27;s an all natural exfoliate that works as a gentle cleanser to not only remove make-up, but also removes blackheads and whiteheads! I had far fewer breakouts this month, and my skin is soft and smooth. I am 100% pleased with the results, and I feel pretty awesome about finding something that&#x27;s environmentally friendly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urged my mother (who has sensitive skin), to try it. She has eczema, and she&#x27;s pleased with how soft her skin feels after using it. She said she didn&#x27;t have any reaction to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m cleaning my bathroom today and tossing out all the products that failed me. If I could give this product more stars, I would. It&#x27;s nice to find an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it helps to prevent blackheads, whiteheads and pimples and absorb impurities, dirt, makeup residues, toxins etc!!! How great is that!!!  It also efficiently moisturizes and dehumidifies and balances skin pH. This wonderful sponge also promotes skin cell regeneration.It is a natural way to clean your skin that is free from additives, toxic chemicals and allergy triggers. I love it!!</li>
