### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>All in all it seems like the perfect foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>REALLY PERFECT.</li>
      <li>Then every time I saw her, her skin looked perfect.</li>
      <li>And the best part is my skin cleared up after a week of use!</li>
      <li>I feel beautiful!  </li>
      <li>Everything about this product is perfect.</li>
      <li>The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like makeup...</li>
      <li>Flawless Application Face Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
      <li>This blends in perfectly and is a great cover for the under the eye circles and makes me look well rested even if I&#x27;m not.      </li>
      <li>I bought this product because my sister in law has beautiful skin and has worn this makeup for years.</li>
      <li>The brushes are also great.  </li>
      <li>All of the products inside it are great and there are none that feel extraneous or like you are paying for soemthing</li>
      <li>As we headed out to the beach, someone who has never complimented my make-up said that I looked great.</li>
      <li>however I found a great use for it.</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels great, and my concern about it being drying to my skin was unwarranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These brushes are amazing!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll look good, feel good, and get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
      <li>0.06 oz bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation in Fair</li>
      <li>Well, it may not be all the make up either, but I haven&#x27;t met anybody who hasn&#x27;t loved the makeup that uses it.</li>
      <li>(It&#x27;s always been my experience that good skin care eliminates the need for good foundation).</li>
      <li>My makeup looks just as good 12 hours after I put it on this morning.</li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t like - even though it still looks good at the end of the day it does rub off on everything.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfect balance of being light weight while still providing good coverage.  </li>
      <li>But the best thing about this kit is that it includes three brushes, a kabuki brush for full coverage foundation application, an all over face brush which works for lighter foundation application or mineral veil application, and a concealer brush for targeting problem areas and blemishes.</li>
      <li>Full Flawless Face Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
      <li>I do not feel the make-up on my skin, and it makes me look so fresh, and best of all</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I just got my kit today and am so in love!</li>
      <li>Lovely!</li>
      <li>You get 3 brushes in the pack that if you were to buy them separately would cost more then the pack!</li>
      <li>And I am so glad that I did!  </li>
      <li>When we got to the party, I didn&#x27;t have time to touch up, but I love the pictures from that day!  </li>
      <li>People are often saying, your skin is amazing.</li>
      <li>This makes you look like you have a nice warm glow.</li>
      <li>The key to great bareMinerals application is these brushes, and the kit provides everything you need to get a flawless face every time.</li>
      <li>I wish there was a way to seal off the holes when on the go (besides my own methods of using tape)</li>
      <li>and I also love the blushes and lip glosses because the effect is naturally gorgeous while still being noticable.</li>
      <li>This includes both fair and fairly light.</li>
      <li>It also comes with \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; which is by far the best blush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been fortunate to have good skin, but now I get compliments on it every time I leave the house.  </li>
      <li>First, it feels great on.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>This is fabulous!</li>
      <li>So I think I&#x27;ll try something more in between when I have to refill.</li>
      <li>My favorite part of the kit is that it comes with the two colors of foundation, so I can use the lighter color for winter and the darker color for summer.  </li>
      <li>(I think it would look best on someone with an Asian background).</li>
      <li>it looks like healthy, even skin.  </li>
      <li>(This foundation covers blemishes better than ANYTHING on the market.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll want to get more of this one.)&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
      <li>andI hope it says around for many more years to come.</li>
      <li>and my skin feels much better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also found that the products work together better as a system for me in the summer when my skin is naturally more oily.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I love this product</li>
      <li>and I fell head over heels in love with it.</li>
      <li>I love B.E., have worn it for years with no problems whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Most makeup I&#x27;ve tried either makes me break out or gives me an allergic skin reaction (even the supposed \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and hypo allergenic products).    </li>
      <li>The foundation covers up these problems better than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>-- my skin has never felt so smooth!</li>
      <li>I love the primer</li>
      <li>First off, it is worth noting that this kit really is a great deal.  </li>
      <li>I have stated wearing the veil under my original makeup and it seems to be much better.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use, covers well and is easy to touch up if need be.</li>
      <li>The instructions are so easy to follow.  </li>
      <li>I have oily skin that tends to break out, and I get great coverage with Bare Minerals.  </li>
      <li>Most foundations I ever tried were either so light that I looked sickly, or so dark that I had an incredibly noticeable foundation line.</li>
      <li>I finally told him and he just loved it, said it was so natural and beautiful</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, a fabulous value.</li>
      <li>It also has some All Over Warmth (it&#x27;s basically a cross between blush and bronzer) and Mineral Veil (which is a great finishing powder) to finish your look.</li>
      <li>0.06 oz bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation in Fairly Light</li>
      <li>Then I apply the mineral veil all over the face to even out skin tone, absorb oil and refract light.</li>
      <li>bottom line is that you&#x27;ll pay more for this make-up, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I prefer a natural look and appreciate how this make-up enhances my good features and minimizes flaws.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quick and easy to apply, gives good coverage, feels light, has a natural SPF15 (from the zinc in it), no chemicals, doesn&#x27;t aggrevate my skin.    </li>
      <li>(*Again, make sure you get the right color for you.)&lt;br /&gt;(1)  </li>
      <li>The makeup goes on smooth, is super easy to blend, and I never end up with a telltale foundation line on my chin.</li>
      <li>That way you can determine whether you like the look with your unique skin type.  </li>
      <li>Fair is very light and fairly light is a tad darker, a bit too dark for my skin</li>
      <li>I love almost everything I&#x27;ve tried in Bare Minerals, but there are of course certain colors that just do not look good on me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re not wearing make-up at all, and if your skin is oily, it soaks that right up and makes your face feel light and clean.  </li>
      <li>There is really nothing in each of the powders to keep them from leaking out through the holes into the top of the container.  </li>
      <li>starter kit is a good deal if you&#x27;re just starting out with bareMinerals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve checked my make-up several times today and it still keeps looking good.  </li>
      <li>It is really important to find the right shade.</li>
      <li>Also, I was told that if the foundation is ever too light for my skin, I can mix in some of the warmth to achieve the right shade.  </li>
      <li>your brushes clean and don&#x27;t forget to swirl, tap and brush on your new, healthier, fabulous look!</li>
      <li>Finally, I am cosmetologist and use and study many, many brushes.</li>
      <li>Even though I haven&#x27;t been able to use these products together much as a kit the purchase price was worth it for the brushes and mineral veil.    </li>
      <li>and I also have permanent \\&quot;mother&#x27;s mask\\&quot; from when I was pregnant with my son 18 years ago.</li>
      <li>The brushes are as high end as you&#x27;ll find in any cosmetician&#x27;s bag, and purchased separately would cost more than this set that includes the make-up.    </li>
      <li>It looks so healthy &amp; natural!!</li>
      <li>Because of all these issues, I prefer to stick to products that are oil free and as gentle as possible, while still providing good coverage.  </li>
      <li>Their mascara is my new favorite</li>
      <li>On top of all of that, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I am really pleased with the makeup so far!</li>
      <li>Usually it&#x27;s pretty mild but sometimes, not so mild.</li>
      <li>I went to Sephora, and made sure I could return it if I had problems with it...as I had been burned by &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; make-up before.    </li>
      <li>Not only did I not break out from the foundation, I honestly think it has improved my skin.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be very drying to my 40-something skin, but when I decided to give it a try I went with the original:</li>
      <li>It has two foundation colors, so you can decide which one is right for you.</li>
      <li>This make-up is just right for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this product in the store after a consultation and I love it.  I have oily skin that tends to break out, and I get great coverage with Bare Minerals.  My favorite part of the kit is that it comes with the two colors of foundation, so I can use the lighter color for winter and the darker color for summer.  Also, I was told that if the foundation is ever too light for my skin, I can mix in some of the warmth to achieve the right shade.  That is so much easier than the 2-3 different colors of liquid foundation I used to deal with!</li>
    <li> I am nineteen years old and have not quite outgrown my acne. Usually it&#x27;s pretty mild but sometimes, not so mild. For a while there, it seemed like I&#x27;d tried everything to make my pimples less noticeable. Nothing ever looked natural and honestly, it made any zits I had look much worse because it was so obvious I had caked something over them. I also always had trouble finding my correct shade because I am somewhere between light and medium skin. Most foundations I ever tried were either so light that I looked sickly, or so dark that I had an incredibly noticeable foundation line. On top of all of that, I have very sensitive skin. Everything new that I put on my skin will just cause me to break out ten times worse than before. When I received this Bare Minerals set for Christmas this year, I was excited but a little skeptical that anything good would come of it. I decided to try it the next day for a Christmas dinner and I fell head over heels in love with it. I couldn&#x27;t believe how beautiful my skin looked, yet I still expected to be covered in zits the next day. Not only did I not break out from the foundation, I honestly think it has improved my skin. It never makes my face feel heavy, clogged, dirty or greasy. I really never remember that I have anything on my face - I feel so naked and natural. Everything about this product is perfect. I would highly recommend it to anyone who asked me about it. The kit comes with two shades of foundation (for me, light and medium) so that you can mix colors if necessary to find that \\&quot;in between\\&quot; skin color of yours. It also comes with \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; which is by far the best blush I have ever tried and \\&quot;mineral veil\\&quot; which helps to smooth out any extra powder you may have applied - making it pretty much IMPOSSIBLE for you to look \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;. Finally, I am cosmetologist and use and study many, many brushes. These brushes are amazing! They do everything that the high end brushes can do. I will continue using this product as long as it is in production.</li>
    <li> I have what i&#x27;ve always considered \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot;. It&#x27;s on the oily side with largish pores, prone to breakouts (even though I&#x27;m in my late 20s), and has a tendency to look greasy under makeup. For years I&#x27;ve worn liquid foundation to cover up these imperfections and to even out my skin tone. I never thought that a powder based foundation could work for me because they typically don&#x27;t provide enough coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few friends that rave about bareMinerals, so when a store near me recently offered a free two week trial kit, I decided to try it. I was shocked at how well the bareMinerals foundation worked. It offers adjustable coverage, so I can wear more foundation when I need it, less when I don&#x27;t. The makeup goes on smooth, is super easy to blend, and I never end up with a telltale foundation line on my chin. My skin doesn&#x27;t get greasy under it, and it&#x27;s all still there at the end of the day. All in all it seems like the perfect foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This starter kit is a good deal if you&#x27;re just starting out with bareMinerals. It has two foundation colors, so you can decide which one is right for you. It also has some All Over Warmth (it&#x27;s basically a cross between blush and bronzer) and Mineral Veil (which is a great finishing powder) to finish your look. But the best thing about this kit is that it includes three brushes, a kabuki brush for full coverage foundation application, an all over face brush which works for lighter foundation application or mineral veil application, and a concealer brush for targeting problem areas and blemishes. The key to great bareMinerals application is these brushes, and the kit provides everything you need to get a flawless face every time.</li>
    <li> I have horrendously sensitive skin.  In the last 20 years I have not found a single type of makeup I can wear -- until now.  No single product can be used by everyone.  That said, I can use Bare Escentuals.  WOW!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my sister in law has beautiful skin and has worn this makeup for years. So, I thought I would give it a try.  I went into the bare escentuals store and had them match my skin tone.  I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to a lot of makeup.  The girl assured my that since it was all natural I would have no problems.  WRONG!!  I wore it for about a month to give it a try.  My face starting itching worse and worse as the days went on and eventually got hives when I put it on.  You will feel a buring within the first five minutes of putting it on.  Then, because of the allergic reaction, I started breaking out.  I don&#x27;t have problems with breakouts normally.  I went back to the store and the girl told me then that some people are allergic to the minerals which apparently I am.  It is the minerals in the foundation.  She told me that I can still wear the mineral veil if I wanted to.  I have tried that and my skin feels much better.  I have stated wearing the veil under my original makeup and it seems to be much better.  I am sad that I can&#x27;t wear the makeup but I wanted to let people know that there is a chance that you could react to it.  I hope this helps all people with extremely sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> I love B.E., have worn it for years with no problems whatsoever. Please disregard any negative reviews as these people either have not applied it properly and/or have dry skin. This is NO reflection on the company! If your skin is dry you need to use a better moisturizer for your skin so the make up won;t look flaky and dry on your skin. If you do not know how to use it then follow the DVD! Must have make up!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot wear any type of liquid or powder foundation.   I had seen the infomercial for this product, and thought something had finally been created for someone like me.  I went to Sephora, and made sure I could return it if I had problems with it...as I had been burned by &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; make-up before.    She assured me I could return it, and unfortunately that&#x27;s what I had to do.   Within 20 minutes of putting it on, my cheeks began to get irritated and red.  So, be very careful if you have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> I tried Bare Escentuals after my sister told me how much she loves it. I am not very impressed by it. I seem to need at least three layers of the foundation to see a difference in my skin. It does not cover acne and does not last all day. Not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for six years now and there is nothing else like it.  I have tried several other mineral products but ended up tossing each. The product goes on smooth and stays on - even on those extra long days. I have heard from some make-up \\&quot;experts\\&quot; that Bare Escentuals is not recommended for older skin.  As a woman of 50 - I can say that as long as you exfoliate once or twice a week and are sure to moisturize, you will not have a problem.  And yes, it can be messy - just do your swirling and tapping over the sink.  This product covers so well yet leaves you feeling like you are not wearing make-up at all.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I just got my kit today and am so in love! It is easy to use, covers well and is easy to touch up if need be. This includes both fair and fairly light. Fair is very light and fairly light is a tad darker, a bit too dark for my skin however I found a great use for it. Warmth, a foundation primer and 3 brushes complete the set.     You start by applying the primer, just a tad all over your face. It helps refine your pores a bit and I think it may help the make up stick. Then you use the swirl, tap, buff method to apply your foundation. You can mix colors, mix with warmth or just use the single color and apply. Then you can use your concealer brush to hide those tough spots. If you have some really troublesome skin you can buff again but I really see no need. Next, lightly brush warmth over your cheeks, nose lower chin and quickly across the forehead. This makes you look like you have a nice warm glow. Now, it may look a bit too strong on fair skin, but once you use the mineral veil, it tames the colors down and evens out your entire skin town to make everything blend seamlessly, refine pores and cover and little spots. You are left with no makeup lines on your face and no signs of wearing make up at all.     My husband came home and said something looks different but could not figure it out (he hates it when I look made up). I finally told him and he just loved it, said it was so natural and beautiful but most importantly it left my skin really soft.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to give mineral make-up a try.  I thought it would be very drying to my 40-something skin, but when I decided to give it a try I went with the original: Bare Escentuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Three years later I&#x27;m still using BE make-up exclusively and couldn&#x27;t be happier! My skin looks and feels great, and my concern about it being drying to my skin was unwarranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this Bare Escentuals Sephora Exclusive Get Started Kit you get the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1)  0.06 oz bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation in Fair **Or the color of your choice. (I have dark brown hair, medium to olive toned skin and I use medium and medium beige foundations. A little of each.)&lt;br /&gt;(1) 0.06 oz bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation in Fairly Light (*Again, make sure you get the right color for you.)&lt;br /&gt;(1)  0.06 All Over Face Color in Warmth (* Use very sparingly as a little goes a long way!)&lt;br /&gt;(1)  0.06 oz Mineral Veil (*Used all the time. You&#x27;ll want to get more of this one.)&lt;br /&gt;(1) Full Flawless Face Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Flawless Application Face Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) How-to instructional DVD&lt;br /&gt;(1) 0.05 oz Prime Time Foundation Primer, a Sephora Exclusive! (*A wonderful, slightly greasy, clear base coat  that gets your face &#x27;primed&#x27; for 100% pure mineral make-up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that you&#x27;ll pay more for this make-up, but it&#x27;s worth it. You&#x27;ll look good, feel good, and get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your brushes clean and don&#x27;t forget to swirl, tap and brush on your new, healthier, fabulous look!</li>
    <li> I just bought the \\&quot;Get Started\\&quot; Bare Minerals kit from the Sephora store in NYC-Times Square a couple of days ago.  I have never used mineral makeup before and I have to say that I really, really like it.  I have skin that tends to start out as a bit dewy in the morning but by the evening I&#x27;m as shiny as a new penny.  This makeup tames that problem.  My makeup looks just as good 12 hours after I put it on this morning. It absorbs the little bit of oil that I have in the morning and keeps the oil from coming out later in the day.  It&#x27;s like a miracle!  I&#x27;ve checked my make-up several times today and it still keeps looking good.  I&#x27;ve been out in the sun a little bit, out in some humidity, back into air conditioning -- no problem.  I love the primer -- my skin has never felt so smooth! I have some sun-damage on my skin (sunbathing too much in my early 20s) and I also have permanent \\&quot;mother&#x27;s mask\\&quot; from when I was pregnant with my son 18 years ago. The foundation covers up these problems better than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried.  And it still looks natural!  As soon as I&#x27;d done with my sample sizes in this starter kit, I am DEFINITELY going to be buying the larger sizes.  I am sold on this stuff!</li>
    <li> Because I have pink undertones and oily skin, I&#x27;d given up trying to find a foundation that would even out my complexion without looking caked on.  When a friend suggested I try the Bare Minerals, I was hesitant, but eventually gave in.  And I am so glad that I did!  Since I started using the BM products in January, my skin has dramatically improved.  It&#x27;s smooth, clear, and looks dewy, not greasy.  My entire morning routine takes about 5 minutes, start to finish, and it lasts all day.  The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like makeup... it looks like healthy, even skin.  Try it!</li>
    <li> This Get Started Kit was my first introduction to Bare Minerals a couple of years ago.  I have typically had problematic skin, which for me means that I am prone to acne breakouts (although these are rare after two rounds of Accutane) and have very dry skin as a result of the courses of Accutane.  To compound matters, my skin is also very sensitive and tends to get red and irritated easily from harsh cleansers.  Because of all these issues, I prefer to stick to products that are oil free and as gentle as possible, while still providing good coverage.  Because of these needs Bare Escentuals intrigued me.    First off, it is worth noting that this kit really is a great deal.  Whenever companies advertise things like \\&quot;$174 value for $60\\&quot; I get skeptical, but in this case I believe it.  All of the products inside it are great and there are none that feel extraneous or like you are paying for soemthing you won&#x27;t use.  I found that using the products together as a system didn&#x27;t work very well for my dry skin because the result looked too flakey and not as smooth and well balanced as liquid foundation, however I still find uses for these products individually.  While I know some people dislike having two different shades of foundation, I have found that the lighter shade works well as a powder in the winter while I like the darker shade in the summer when I have more color.  I&#x27;ve also found that the products work together better as a system for me in the summer when my skin is naturally more oily.  Overall though I love that this product is sensitive on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritation.    Of all the products, my favorites are the mineral vail and brushes.  Even when I am using liquid foundation and primer from other brands I love the mineral vail as a powder.  It&#x27;s a perfect balance of being light weight while still providing good coverage.  I especially like that it has a subtle sheen/sparkle to it that gives my face a more polished look.  The brushes are also great.  They have held up over the couple of years I have had this kit (while the powders are all long gone) and are equally good as some of the professional quality brushes I have found, which can be very expensive.  Even though I haven&#x27;t been able to use these products together much as a kit the purchase price was worth it for the brushes and mineral veil.    My only other complaint about this kit is that the products really are not meant for someone who travels frequently.  There is really nothing in each of the powders to keep them from leaking out through the holes into the top of the container.  This is a pain because when you go to apply it there is then too much on top and either you get too much on your face or have to waste some in order to get an appropriate amount of powder.  I wish there was a way to seal off the holes when on the go (besides my own methods of using tape) because I find I waste a lot this way and it makes my bathroom a mess.    Overall though, I think Bare Excentuals is a great brand.  If you have dry skin like I do I highly recommend you try this out in-store before purchasing.  (Have an associate help you put it on yourself rather than them doing it as I find I often have a hard time duplicating the exact results when they do all the work!)  That way you can determine whether you like the look with your unique skin type.  Even if you find these products do not work together for you as a system, there are also still many Bare Escentuals products worth trying out.  Their mascara is my new favorite and I also love the blushes and lip glosses because the effect is naturally gorgeous while still being noticable.</li>
    <li> I needed some new makeup so I decided to go ahead and try this.  I have a mixture of oily (sometimes) and dry (sometimes) skin...so I didn&#x27;t know what to do.  I bought the starter pack which is a STEAL!  You get 3 brushes in the pack that if you were to buy them separately would cost more then the pack! PLUS the four small containers of makeup (two foundation, a warmth and veil).  This is fabulous! The instructions are so easy to follow.  And the best part is my skin cleared up after a week of use! It looks so healthy &amp; natural!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical of the Bare Escentuals craze for a long time. As a former model, I&#x27;ve seen lots of make-up fads come and go. What finally brought me around was the difference I started noticing in my hairstylist&#x27;s skin. She&#x27;d never had BAD skin, but it wasn&#x27;t flawless. Then every time I saw her, her skin looked perfect. REALLY PERFECT. I asked her what she was using, and she said Bare Escentuals. Still, I thought the stuff seemed a little pricey, especially considering that I almost never wear base make-up. (It&#x27;s always been my experience that good skin care eliminates the need for good foundation). But everyone gets the occasional blemish, and I&#x27;ve found that traditional \\&quot;wet\\&quot; make-up just exacerbates the problem.    I bought the fairest of the Bare Minerals starter kits, and I&#x27;m totally blown away. The brushes are as high end as you&#x27;ll find in any cosmetician&#x27;s bag, and purchased separately would cost more than this set that includes the make-up.    As for the make-up, my experience is as follows:  First, it feels great on.  It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re not wearing make-up at all, and if your skin is oily, it soaks that right up and makes your face feel light and clean.  Nor does it exacerbate any dry skin conditions; this really does work on everyone.    As for the colors, one of the two shades of foundation was just right for me, but I actually only use it to cover under eye circles, a little shine in the T-zone, and on the very rare blemish. In other words, I use the foundation as concealer, using the concealer brush for precision. (This foundation covers blemishes better than ANYTHING on the market. It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t exist. You can have the biggest, reddest pimple on the fairest of skin, and when you apply the foundation as concealer, it ceases to exist)! Then I apply the mineral veil all over the face to even out skin tone, absorb oil and refract light. I&#x27;ve always been fortunate to have good skin, but now I get compliments on it every time I leave the house.  Another great thing about this make-up is that it takes very little to achieve a great effect, so even though these are the smaller sample size pots, they do last a long time.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year, and the only thing I&#x27;ve had to purchase is the mineral veil.  (I do not, however, wear make-up every day).    There are only two things I&#x27;m not crazy about with this kit. First is the bronzer. It is WAY, WAAAAAY too dark for anyone who&#x27;s caucasian, fair-skinned or not. (I think it would look best on someone with an Asian background). The other thing I can live without is the primer; it gave me a pimple.    Nonetheless, a fabulous value. Buy this with total confidence - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Personally I don&#x27;t know how I ever went without it, and I don&#x27;t intend to be without it ever again!</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Bare Minerals starter kit in Medium. I am really pleased with the makeup so far! It has worked well for me, although I know it&#x27;s not a cure-all for everyone. Let me also so that I don&#x27;t wear much make up to begin with, which is why I like this product. I usually just use bronzer, a touch of powder and some mascara. I like that this doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel yucky by the end of the day. I work with 2 year olds, so I have alot of dirty kids hands on my face all day. So far, my skin hasn&#x27;t feel gross by the end of the day with this makeup. I would definitely recommend this for someone who just likes light coverage and doesn&#x27;t like to feel like they are wearing make up. The only complaint I have is that the medium kit is a touch too light for my skin, but the tan kit would have been too dark. So I think I&#x27;ll try something more in between when I have to refill.</li>
    <li> This make-up is just right for me. It is really important to find the right shade. Read about the shades on their site. I have a pink undertones, and medium is lovely on me. I ran out, and tried to wear medium-biege, which was not a good idea. You also might not need everything that comes in the kit. Give it all a try and experiment, and if a certain shade or item doesn&#x27;t work, just use the ones that do. I love almost everything I&#x27;ve tried in Bare Minerals, but there are of course certain colors that just do not look good on me. I just keep what does. I have never worn make-up often because I do not like the feel of it on my skin, until now!  I have been wearing Bare Minerals for three years.  Now I wear it every day! I do not feel the make-up on my skin, and it makes me look so fresh, and best of all I feel beautiful!  I prefer a natural look and appreciate how this make-up enhances my good features and minimizes flaws. The first time I wore Bare Minerals was when I spent a hot summer day at the beach (on the sand) and went straight to a party. As we headed out to the beach, someone who has never complimented my make-up said that I looked great. And I knew it! When we got to the party, I didn&#x27;t have time to touch up, but I love the pictures from that day!  My face did get shiny (as mine does) after a day in the heat, but I still looked radiant! I was glowing. On a normal day, I&#x27;m not so shiny with Bare Minerals. If you have oily skin as I do, here is what works for me. Before applying make-up, I put on Olay Age Defying Protective Renewal Lotion. It moisturizes and keeps my shine at bay. I wait a few minutes and then add the Bare Minerals, and just glow. Lovely!</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I was 16 as a gift from my mother. I loved this stuff since it would make my face look less red from acne. I kept using it until I was 18 when I stopped because it was too expensive for me. So for the next year and a half, I went through the regular brands...Maybelline, Revlon, Physicians Formula, etc.. Nothing seemed to give me the coverage or the lightness on my skin. I also didn&#x27;t like that the other makeups would rub off easily or felt very &#x27;fake&#x27;. I sucked it up and again purchased the Starter Kit from Ulta. I haven&#x27;t looked back in 2 years and glad that I made the switch back... my face thanks me everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with the other makeups. Nothing else compares to this.</li>
    <li> I am a very pale person.  I am part Irish and burn if the sun looks in my general direction.  Many make-ups are not made for people quite as pale as I am nor do they look right.  This blends in perfectly and is a great cover for the under the eye circles and makes me look well rested even if I&#x27;m not.      I am 26 so I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I love this product andI hope it says around for many more years to come.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 years. I usually buy the kit when I run out and have new brushes to go with the things I need. My skin has cleared up since I started using it and people comment all the time about how pretty I look. Well, it may not be the make up, but the comments have definitely increased. People are often saying, your skin is amazing. Well, it may not be all the make up either, but I haven&#x27;t met anybody who hasn&#x27;t loved the makeup that uses it. I bought it because one of my acquaintences looked SO pretty one day and I asked her if she might be using something on her face that was new. Bare Mineral was her answer. I RAN out and bought it. I&#x27;ve never regretted it. I recently \\&quot;Freecycled\\&quot; the extra color you get in each kit since they are always a color you cannot use.</li>
    <li> After seeing the Bare Escentuals informercial several times I was curious to find out for myself. I have had problematic skin since I was a teen and I also have very sensative skin.  Most makeup I&#x27;ve tried either makes me break out or gives me an allergic skin reaction (even the supposed \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and hypo allergenic products).    What I like about Bare Escentuals - it&#x27;s quick and easy to apply, gives good coverage, feels light, has a natural SPF15 (from the zinc in it), no chemicals, doesn&#x27;t aggrevate my skin.    What I don&#x27;t like - even though it still looks good at the end of the day it does rub off on everything. The other problem is that if you have a dry patch or healing blemish the powder foundation makes it more noticeable.    Overall, it&#x27;s done better for me then liquid foundations and I&#x27;ll keep using it. If you buy the kits it&#x27;s pretty reasonably priced considering how little you have to use and how long it will last.</li>
