    <li> This was just what I was looking for. Love this perfume. Was the perfect size and came super fast.</li>
    <li> The Wife Loves It!!! Thank You.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful, but it lasts for about two hours before it fades away. It doesn&#x27;t last on clothes or skin. I tried every trick in the book to make it last longer but nothing worked. I would not recommend buying this product because the quality just isn&#x27;t worth it. However, Amazon was very helpful in that they offered me a full refund without having to send the product back. So thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because of the packaging and it looked really great.  I&#x27;ve bought this fragrance before and I fell in LOVE with it.  Love how light and fun it is.  It&#x27;s definitely a SPRINGTIME scent.  Yes I am old fashioned and I buy scents for the seasons and climate change (smile) I just hope that purchase is the same thing and not some knockoff.  I&#x27;ve been reading some pretty scary reveiws here lately.  I guess we&#x27;ll see after Christmas, it is a gift for my Mom</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, perfectly packed. Love my new perfume</li>
    <li> Very good! Nice purchase, exactly what I want. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Light sweet scent that has a clean fresh honeysuckle tones.</li>

    <li> Very clean and floral smell. Absolutely love this on my wife!</li>
    <li> Honey by Marc Jacbos smells sweet and light without being overpowering. I wear it everyday. (Note, it does not smell like anything you would buy from bath and bodyworks--thank goodness.)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy perfume without trying it first, but there were so many good reviews.  I figured it was a sure thing.  It was the most overpowering perfume I have ever smelled.  I only spritzed a light mist on my wrists and I felt like the scent overcame the entire area around me.  I had an instant headache.  Smelled like a grandma perfume.  Very strong.  I had to wash my arms with Dawn twice to get the smell off me and even then, it lingered.  It was awful.</li>
    <li> Perfect and super fast arrival!</li>
