<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good ingredients but I don&#x27;t advise using this if you don&#x27;t have acne, unless you are ready to purge because of the increased cell turnover. This worked nicely on other areas but sadly was too much for me to handle on my face. Highly recommend this for mild acne and other skin types</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I have seen results over time.  My skin looks fresher and tighter.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Used it for weeks.</li>
    <li> This is really 2.5 stars for me. I liked the feel of the product on my face--felt like it was firming, yet the smell is horrible. It might be better mixed in with other products.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t see any difference... Maybe it&#x27;s me...</li>
    <li> Very good product.  As the directions indicate, put this on first and wait a few minutes until it absorbs before putting on moisturizer.  My makeup seems to go on and stay on much better when I use this first.  Very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> As I age, my skin has become drier.  I am on a constant quest for effective skin lotions and creams.  I am very happy to have found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, my skin was noticeably brighter.  The effect was subtle, but noticeable.  I will never again have the skin of a 20 year old, since I am a long way from 20, but my skin definitely looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first few days of use, I was concerned that it would be too drying for my skin, but the good results speak for themselves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  After only a week or so of use, my skin is noticeably brighter.&lt;br /&gt;* The natural ingredients.  This product has:  sea kelp, coconut endosperm, collagen, and hyaluronic acid, among other things.&lt;br /&gt;* No scent.  This is a pet peeve of mine since so many facial products are ruined by a strong and unpleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;* Only a very small amount is needed, so the bottle will last a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my skin is dry, I was concerned that this serum would be too drying for my skin.  Here is  how I manage that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I only use it at night and I also apply the resurface night cream.&lt;br /&gt;2. I use it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;3. I plan to use it during the warmer months and not in the winter time, when my skin is especially dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a way to help revitalize your skin, this may just be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to try out and this is my opinion. The very first night after I used this my skin was incredibly soft! I used it another night  after using my derma roller for recovery and it is an amazing product! It does exactly what it promises! The scent is light and pleasant. It&#x27;s also very easy to apply! Just lightly spray it on a couple of your fingers and apply where needed most. My skin feels more supple and looks great! It has a dewey look to it now! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants great looking skin!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of products, but I can really see a difference with this one. My skin&#x27;s clarity and firmness are visibly improved, redness almost gone and wrinkles all but gone (I&#x27;m 57). Good delivery system and the company customer support is outstanding! This one is worth it!</li>
    <li> A very good anti wrinkle serum. Enriched with Sea Kelp to Nourish Your Skin to a More Healthy Complexion. It is made of all natural ingredients which make it suitable for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;This has reduced skin tone uneven-ness.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin but this did not react to my skin like other serums do. This stayed well and also worked and brought difference to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is good. Made for easy application. A very little amount is enough to apply on the skin hence the bottle will last a long time. It improves Skin Texture and Plump Skin Naturally so it Feels Smoother and Softer.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good product. I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> I have very dry dull skin due to an extended illness so I am always looking for new ways to perk it up a bit,  recently I was offered this item during a promotion and since i knew the PROTEGE line I jumped at the chance to try it! I have only used it for a few days now but I could see the results the morning after the first application.  It makes my face feel smoother and the pores are shrinking as well. If you are looking for a wonderful product line you have found it.</li>
    <li> I had previously asked a question on here if it perhaps this serum would help with collagen or minimizing my pores, and to a certain extent the answers were ok. I also asked a representative about this through e-mails if I should use this serum after dermarolling, and they said yes that&#x27;d it totally help. I also mentioned to them that I was 20 years old and if that perhaps mattered, since I saw that a lot of people here used them for aging. Anyways, I finally tried it on after I used my dermaroller and it didn&#x27;t work if anything it made my pores bigger. I&#x27;m quite frustrated about this since I should have known better, and perhaps I should have bought a different Vitamin A serum.  EDIT: i recently got a refund, so I decided to give 3 stars to this, Customer service is really good and straight forward, perhaps I&#x27;ll give another Protege product a chance. But since I saw the glowing reviews I decided to give it a go. I&#x27;m guessing it may work for some people, but it didn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m really upset over this and well, hopefully I can find something that will fix the damage done.</li>
    <li> My package arrived promptly and in great condition.  I ordered the A+active to compliment my Vit C from Protege that I use in the morning.  The combination of both of these products makes your skin amazing.  I have had so many compliments over the past several days that it can&#x27;t help but make you feel really good.  Love the Protege line and look forward to trying some of the other products they offer.</li>
    <li> I like this serum very much. It isn&#x27;t sticky like many are and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate. It goes on smoothly and feels like moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I comes in a dropper bottle and I only have to use about a 1/2 dropper for my entire face.  It&#x27;s 1 oz. I think it will last a couple months at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum contains high quality natural ingredients, nutrients, vitamins, minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reduces wrinkles, improves my skin texture. It gives my skin a firmer appearance.  It has lightened my brown sun spots noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the USA and  is Parabens, Sulfates and Phthalates free- I like that they don&#x27;t test their products on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this company, they stand behind their products with 30 day refund so you can contact them for a full refund if for any reason you are not satisfied. .</li>
    <li> This is a good product at a reasonable price. I would buy this again. I like using A-CTIVE at night.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and makes my skin very soft! I am also starting to see the wrinkles under my eyes slowly start to disappear after about 3 weeks of use!</li>
    <li> I use this serum after derma rolling. It spreads easily and my skin has improved</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. I&#x27;m recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, the first ingredient is kelp which is so amazing for facial skin. I have been using for 3 weeks and my skin looks fresher and brighter, my complexion seems evened , it&#x27;s summer so I don&#x27;t really know how it&#x27;s working on fading freckles / sun spots ,but they aren&#x27;t getting darker with the extra sun exposure.  I loved it so much I ordered more. Here&#x27;s a tip I Order 3 and got  1 for free plus free shipping using thier promo code so  it you&#x27;ll save $40.00 scroll on product details and you&#x27;ll find it. This is a review that I wrote myself not a paid one or a product review , I am in my 40s and am on the hunt for anything that gives results ,,so I want to help my fellow gals , I always wonder if they are fake or not when they are TOO GOOD, but this stuff is really special and I just want to share :)</li>
    <li> I been using this product for about a month  and I have not noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best anti-aging products I have used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using A+Active AA Serum for a week, off and on.  Off, because I wanted to see if there was a difference when I didn&#x27;t use it.  Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used alone, without any other sera, lotions, or creams, there wasn&#x27;t much difference.&lt;br /&gt;When used in conjunction with regular moisturizers, the A+Active seemed to make the other products absorb more thoroughly.  When used at night, my morning skin was smoother, brighter and more even looking.  When used in the morning under my daily moisturizer,  my skin looked all around better.  I didn&#x27;t need as much makeup, and what I wore went on more smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference was when I paired the A+Active with a hyaluronic cream (another brand) at night.  Wow. My aging, combination dry/oily, sun damaged skin positively glows.  It looks a lot better, even after only a couple of applications. I&#x27;ve been using a Vitamin C serum intermittently, which probably helps too.  The A+Active seems to make whatever else I&#x27;m using work better.  I&#x27;m really pleased, and even though I was provided a sample for review, I&#x27;m recommending this product to non-Amazon friends who&#x27;ve been bemoaning the lack of effective skin care products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+Active is not a miracle worker-it&#x27;s not going to significantly turn back the clock unless you&#x27;ve severely neglected your skin for years, and you shouldn&#x27;t expect major improvement using it by itself; but try it, try it, try it in conjunction with other products.  I don&#x27;t expect a whole lot from topically applied products, but I&#x27;m delighted by the results I&#x27;m seeing. It&#x27;s a case where the result is sigificantly greater than the sum of the parts. The company offers a satisfaction guarantee, so you really have nothing to lose, and some pretty great skin to gain.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have dark circles and bags under my eyes and have tried so many top named products on the market that were unsuccessful for me.  I have only used this serum a few times and can already see results.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how fabulous I will look after extended use!!</li>
    <li> Been using this nightly so far. Instructions advise to use 20-30 minutes after washing face, but as long as it has had time to dry. Been looking for a retinol product for fine lines. Increases collagen and I can see a difference after a few weeks of use. Face appears to have more of a glow and appears brighter. I&#x27;ll have to continue use to see if I notice a difference for fine lines. Comes in a little dropper and small amount goes a long way.  Watery, so easy to apply. I put on a moisturizer and haven&#x27;t noticed and dryness. I do make sure to apply a SPF sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I must say, I am so far VERY impressed with Protege products. Using this Retinol Serum has been one of the greatest products I have found at a very reasonable price, for the result. In 1 use, no joke, I saw a difference in my skin. Now, week 2.. INCREDIBLE!! I will say this, I went to see my Aesthetician yesterday and she said, &amp;#34;Michelle, what have you been doing to your skin it&#x27;s flawless and so smooth!&amp;#34;  I asked about another facial and she and the receptionist both said, &amp;#34;For What?&amp;#34; I think the greatest review of a product comes from others compliments. IT IS THEN... Your eyes are not deceiving you and you know &amp;#34;THIS WORKS!&amp;#34; so much so I have bought the Vitamin C, as well as the Collage. LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I am amazed and in love with the results my skin looks great  and I know with continued use it is simply going to keep making me look and feel better my skin is glowing  a must have</li>
    <li> *Disclaimer: I was sent this product for review. Opinions expressed are completely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment of this product was very fast, and I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks now. Dispensing the serum is very easy by using the pump. The serum is a tan color and has a light scent. I apply the serum at night and 20 minutes after I have washed my face and I&#x27;ve notice my face has become bit brighter and softer since using the serum. The serum itself feels silky on the face and not much is needed to apply onto the skin. There&#x27;s a little bit of a tingling feeling after applying the serum which I find refreshing. Overall, I like this product and look forward to more results with future use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother- in-law. She is so happy with the product because he saw results instantly. she recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel over sensitive to the sun. I feel like my skin is smoother.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference using this product, might take more time.  I&#x27;ll keep using and hoping to see something happen with my skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once so far but I could tell an immediate difference in my skin, it feels smoother already.  I cannot wait to see the results after I have used this for awhile.  Seller is GREAT to work with also!  A+++++</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I only wear makeup once a week but I needed something that smoothed my complexion without leaving it feeling oily. This is perfect for my sensitive skin. It has also smoothed out a rough flaky spot on the side of my face,it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this stuff is GREAT!  My skin is smoother, softer and  my pores are GONE  I use it at night underneath my MAC moisturizer and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I have seen great improvement, my skin feels and looks healthy and my glow is back.  I am using it now on my strech marks caused by pregnancy and it&#x27;s helping to smooth the ripples.  100 % satisfied</li>
    <li> Excellent! I use all the time! my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> This product is not as described.  It is sticky and uncomfortable on face.  I would return it, but I missed my return deadline.  In fact all the products I purchased in this line feel inferior and work poorly with my existing products.</li>
    <li> Really loving this. I&#x27;ve been using for just over a week, definitely a visible reduction in pores and my skin is feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> Wow -- GREAT product!  After being disappointed in the lack of results I got from another Protege product, I didn&#x27;t have super high hopes for this product but am SO glad I tried it....within days my skin looks better than it has in months!  I have super weird mature skin that still breaks out and gets oily, but is super sensitive to products and gets flaky really easily.  I have been using this product for about ten days and absolutely love it....my skin is smoother and less breakouts. I will buy this again and again....and now I feel excited to try more of this company&#x27;s products.  They were so responsive when I was underwhelmed with the other product that I feel totally confident in trying others, knowing that they will stand behind their products with integrity.</li>
    <li> Feels great on and a little goes a long way. This bottle is worth the price because it will last a while. Looking forward to seeing results as time goes by.</li>
    <li> I love this Serum work great</li>
    <li> I love Protege skin care products! I use their emfaceize as my daily morning moisturizer....and their resurface as my daily night time moisturizer along with this product to smooth &amp; prevent wrinkles. I like the mess free push pump dispenser a lot, as it makes for waste free dispensing. Retinyl Acetate and other retinoids are used as antiaging chemicals. Vitamin A is absorbed through the skin and increases the rate of skin turnover, &amp; also gives an increase in collagen.... resulting in a more youthful appearance. This serum alleviates inflammation and soothes the skin. The best thing for me is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh scent. I received this serum @ a discounted price for my review, regardless, I only recommend products that I use personally.</li>
    <li> I tried it for a few days and already can see results.  My skin was dry with uneven tones and I even had a patch of dermatitis from dermarolling.  Almost all of this cleared up as well as some acne I was getting on my forehead and chin.  My skin is smoother, clearer and tone is evening out wonderfully.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I am a 59 year old male and I have always looked 10 to 15 years younger but lately, I noticed that father time had steadily been gaining on me so I decided to do something about it. I gave A+CTIVE a try, I had nothing to lose. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at first because I see my face everyday in the mirror but two weeks after using the product, I went to a family get-together and my relatives  noticed something different about my looks. They said my face looked smoother and younger. That&#x27;s when I told them about A+CTIVE. So I guess the product works and I am very happy with it. Customer service is great too and very helpful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 10 days and can surely see the difference under my eyes. I have dark, puffy circles under my eyes and this serum is helping with that for sure. I like the way it&#x27;s  not harsh on your skin and not bad smelling. It is also nice to use on your face and I&#x27;ve even used on my hands since they look older than I would like and this seems to be helping there also. I would recommend this serum to all looking for help to tighten skin or puffy eyes. Thank you..</li>
    <li> Noticed results within the first few days.  My sister and sister-in-law also notice how great my skin was looking and they are now using this product also.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Great serum! I got this product to help with under my eyes and it works great. Very impressed with this product and the results I am getting!</li>
    <li> Made my skin so soft!  Arrived quickly- I am one happy camper!</li>
    <li> I love the way A-CTIVE makes my face feel</li>
    <li> I have purchased other serums costing as much as $200-$300. After experiencing this product, I wanted to cry over all that wasted money! It absolutely lives up to each and every one of its promises and then some. I will never, ever use a different serum!</li>
    <li> This product goes on smooth and works like a charm! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a change in my crows feet so I will need to update once I do.</li>
    <li> I have 2 weeks using this product and work for me an my wife.  Its no color or odor on you face.  Really like.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for just two weeks and I can see the improvements of old blemishes diminishing (acne scars and darkness spots of the skin from previous facial resurfacing). I have also noticed the firmness of how my skin feels even after washing my face. Although the directions says to use at night due to increase risks of sunburns, I however, spend most of my time indoors during the day so I apply this product both day and night without any negative effect such as drying of the skin.  I noticed a small application goes a long way. I use one - two pumps for my entire face.  I have read previous reviews and several individuals have posted that the product was dispensed from a useless long dropper but it now comes in a form of a pump.  I love this product and will reorder more once the bottle is empty. I am happy that I came across this product on amazon because it was a product that was recommended from my previous purchase of vitamin c mixed with hyaluronic acid. This product contains vitamin A serum along with hyaluronic acid and it works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few Vitamin C with Hyaluronic acid serums of late, but this Vitamin A with Sea Kelp, Collagen, and Hyaluronic acid is new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the mess free push pump dispenser and that it came packaged in a felt bag. The only discernable scent was a slightly salty one which makes sense since Sea Kelp is the first ingredient. I&#x27;m not sure whether a Vitamin C or A serum is superior. I like that there isn&#x27;t a medicinal smell that many of the Vitamin C serums have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and like how it feels on my skin. I had been out of town for 6 weeks (more on that soon). I realize any skincare routine or serum can take many weeks or months to have the best effect.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference in my under eye bags which was the reason I purchased this product. If anything, it irritates the area and causes reddening of the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now.  I have nothing but good things to say about it.  It has definitely done exactly what the makers claim.  I had been using another serum that did even out my facial skin tones. But it left my face dry and brittle, really looked awful.  I started using this product and noticed a change in my skin overnight.  I was amazed at how it immediately started to soften my skin.  I used it at night and did not have to combine another moisturizer with it.  I did occasional use a moisturizer during daylight hours.  Believe me when I tell you that my face is so soft, moisturized, and rejuvenated.  You can&#x27;t go wrong by purchasing this product.  In my opinion, it is GREAT!!!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34; the product and &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34; this company . . . seriously.  My skin feels better since using this product, and any and all contact I have had with the &amp;#34;Protégé&amp;#34; company has been nothing  but professional and positive.  When they tell you they stand behind their products, its not hype, its truly their business credo.  I have nothing but good, no, let me correct that. . . . &amp;#34;GREAT&amp;#34; things to say about this company and their products, and fully intend to continue doing business with them.  &amp;#34;Thank you Protégé!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Has a very silky feel and my sensitive/acne prone skin responds well to it.  Have yet to see visible results but I have not used it religiously as instructed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Anti-Wrintkel Vitamin A Serum. I didn&#x27;t see any good improvement on my eye! maybe it will work for some other people! but it didn&#x27;t work for me! I will never buy it again!</li>
    <li> IT DIDN&#x27;T DO SO FAR AS MUCH AS I WANTED IT TO DO.  I ALSO WANTED TO USE IT DURING THE DAY TIME AND THEY&lt;br /&gt;DIDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THAT BECAUSE OF THE SUN ON YOUR SKIN WHEN YOU USED IT.  I THINK I WILL KEEP LOOKING.</li>
    <li> I put this on at night, and I love how soft my skin feels in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve only been using for a short time but can notice a difference.</li>
    <li> This serum works incredibly well.  The application is smooth, and it absorbs very quickly leaving my skin smooth and moisturized.  Since I have begun using it, I have seen a drastic reduction in my pore size, as well as the appearance of fine lines around my eyes, which I love.  The only issue that I had (reason for three stars) is that standard shipping took almost a week.  Maybe it&#x27;s time to upgrade to Prime.  Either way, I will reorder A+CTIVE when it runs out (the bottle should last at least a couple of months, though).</li>
    <li> This anti-aging serum with Hyaluronic Acid packs a punch against wrinkles and sags and it works pretty fast! This is a very good quality, light weight cream that also contains Vitamin A and Sea Kelp making for a very fast acting beauty serum that I am surprised works so quickly. Fine lines are diminished and skin is renewed with this serum. It&#x27;s a light cream where a little tiny bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acid in this serum will dry out your skin so have a nice moisturizer to use in conjunction with it. The serum itself has some great ingredients to smooth skin, but over time, the Hyaluronic Acid removes the dull top layers of your skin and a good moisturizer really helps. It&#x27;s a little crazy but I&#x27;ve used this product with a Derma Roller and Wow, it makes a huge difference and works very fast. This product can make you more sun sensitive so an SPF make-up or sunscreen is good to add too now that winter is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product is not tested on animals and that it is a US based company. Most importantly, it works very well as an anti-aging cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agreed to try this product and review it and I am more than happy with the results thus far. It&#x27;s fast acting and the bottle will last a long time because you use so little of the product when applied.</li>
    <li> Great for travel to hold my RX drugs or vitamins. I use them weekly also to transport my vitamins when I am eating out. They are much more reliable and less bulky than the boxes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product - thank you for this!!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be just what it says that it is.  I have just started using it so far so good.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars, but then it would have meant I had experienced a miracle of not a single wrinkle left to see!  But, I really can tell a noticeable difference in the decrease of lines around my eyes and mouth and am very pleased with that in a short 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I like this serum. I&#x27;ve only used a few retinol serums and this is a really good one. It has a nice, light scent to it and absorbs very quickly into my skin. It definitely does what it is supposed to do too. My skin looks much brighter and much smoother after a months use! Definitely a good purchase!</li>
    <li> This makes my skin quite smooth,and I notice that the big crease in my forehead is not so visible anymore. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product. I have been using it a little over a week now. I had a bit of rough texture skin on my face. Literally 3 days after using this I noticed that my skin felt smoother, and so did my husband!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen many results yet. It&#x27;s a nice serum, goes on silky and is light. I was emailed the &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; for this product, I think those should be included in the packaging. Which wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid forties and have the fine lines and uneven skin tone. This Serum has been effective in making the overall appearance of my skin smoother, brighter, healthier looking! I have been super impressed with the results. I love the pump that expels the product, the fact that it is cruelty free, and the fact that the company offers a money back guarantee!</li>
    <li> This serum is great. Highly recommended. Night only. Really work&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It works great!  It’s packaged in a nice, easy-to-use glass dispensing bottle.  It’s so rare to find a glass bottle with an easy dispenser. It spreads evenly on the skin. It feels soft and gentle and smells natural. It’s the perfect product to apply before make-up and even revives dull skin. I’m so pleased with it and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to use A+CTIVE Anti-Aging Retinol (Vitamin A) Serum.  This serum has its own pump that dispenses small amounts of the serum.  This would be appropriate to use both in the morning or at night after you wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+CTIVE is an anti-wrinkle serum with collagen, sea kelp and hyaluronic acid to smooth skin, reduce wrinkles, and under-eye puffiness.  It nourishes, heals, and protects your skin.  My skin feels smooth and looks great since using A+CTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing your face, apply A+CTIVE to your face and neck.  Depending on your skin type, you may not need to apply a moisturizer.  I have combination skin and I do still use a moisturizer.  It dries rapidly, so you need to blend it in quickly.  A+CTIVE didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or greasy.  It was absorbed into my skin and left no tell-tale signs behind.  Because you only need to use a small amount of the product, this bottle will last you well over a month or more.  This product is made in America and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I started a month ago and I see some improvement with my forehead small lines. It has lightened my dark circles under my eyes. I was also fighting Milia, 7 spots on my cheek. Believe it or not the big one is gone and it diminishe the small ones, I have only tiny 3 ones left, but they are better!  A small amount goes far and now I use on my entire face, it looks better and very soft! Will continue my use!  Thank you Stephaine in customer support you are awesome!! 😊.  Pam</li>
    <li> I love this serum!!!! I have tried numerous products and I can, honestly, say that this is the best. After I do my derma roller treatment I apply this and my skin feels like velvet. I have been using it faithfully for two weeks and I can already see an improvement in the firmness of my skin as well as diminished wrinkles!!!!!</li>
    <li> Feels great on your face.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have any results to report.  The texture is very pleasant and there is no perfume.  I am hoping this will be the last product I have to try! Now I have been using this product for a while and am happy to report soft, smooth skin.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any discomfort or negative effects.  The wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable-which pleases me very much.</li>
    <li> I am always on the look out for great serums without having to do peels or expensive facials. I am very happy to have found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, my skin was much smoother. My skin definitely looks better and my makeup goes on smoother and doesn&#x27;t have as many lines where it gets stuck on dry skin! I love the natural ingredients: sea kelp, coconut,collagen, and hyaluronic acid, among other things. Also, a little goes a long way so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> This item frustrated from the beginning, I went to try it out and pumped it a million times(well at least it felt that way) and nothing would come out. I then went ahead and unscrewed the top, it seems that the pump they &amp;#34;SHOVED&amp;#34; in this bottle was for a larger bottle item. Unfortunately this has tainted my review for this item.</li>
    <li> Great product for my mom.  Goes on smooth and have a nice scent.</li>
    <li> It appears to be watered down...but I use it anyway...I.m now purchasing the retinol pads, I think I will use them from now on. The pump tube in this bottle was the longest I.ve ever seen..it.s way too long and I threw it away and just put a screw top on the bottle from something else.</li>
