    <li> Best color for my beige skin tone. of course there isn&#x27;t a chip free polish but i guess if you sit with your hands in the air all day do nothing it will last longer. This lasted about three days without chipping.</li>
    <li> True blue color will last about 7 days with two coats no clear needed have 43 of this product in different colors</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite nail polish. The color is great, a beautiful balance between cobalt and navy blue. It is bright and vibrant, without being too metallic. The brush is great and makes for a smooth, even application. It is long-lasting and doesn&#x27;t chip for about a week, even without a protective top coat. I consider it an overall great nail polish.</li>
    <li> I lov e this polish. I always order Sally Hansen nail polish. The colors are great and they last long.I received my order fast and with no problems. Will order more after holidays.</li>
    <li> A true cobalt blue with great metallic tones that don&#x27;t &#x27;matte&#x27; when dry.  All polish chips eventually but this holds up as well as any.</li>
    <li> I love the xtreme wear line. It&#x27;s the most durable polish I&#x27;ve found and lasts almost a week without chipping, so it only really needs redone when my nails have grown out. This particular shade I had worn for several weeks and was thinking about changing when I discovered Doctor Who. It&#x27;s a perfect TARDIS blue and I&#x27;ve kept it for four months.</li>
    <li> Love it ...Love it...Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This color is too cool! Bloke it on my toes for the beach!</li>
    <li> i love this line and the price is right and  i would like to see more from sally hansen like a deep conditoner for natural nails because or nails  need a deepconditioner just like our hair do and i woulf like to see aragan oil by sally hansen</li>
    <li> I love this color! When I received this item, It was a little darker than I expected but i love the finish it leaves!</li>
    <li> I saw this nail polish on Amazon and I really loved the color so i bought it. However it took so long to get to me I forgot I had ordered it! When I first tried it out the brush (all the way up to the cap ) was drenched in polish. it made it hard to paint my nails because I had to much of the polish on the brush. It also got really messy- all over my hands. Maybe I&#x27;m just bad at painting nails but if I had to buy it again I would. I love the color so much! I would say its worth the money but be careful!</li>
    <li> Finally I get a  nail polish that I can truly appreciate  it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do one coat and I&#x27;m done this is a beautiful  royal blue  and dries pretty fast all this  at a very good price  thank you finally</li>
    <li> I just love sally nail polish, and i loved this color, super happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I only use Sally Hansen Nail Polishes. This is one of my go colors. I always receive so many compliments especially from men when I wear this color. Good to know that I can get in on Amazon since it&#x27;s almost impossible to find in store at times.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, just what I was looking for !</li>
    <li> Cute but however does not look the same color as shown its way darker</li>
    <li> Awesome color for my daughter and I.  We love the bright colors for our nails and this one really stands out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this color at my local Rite Aid.  I wanted something festive for the winter season...so, I went for this blue.  It looks great.  Very vibrant and shiny.  You don&#x27;t even really need a top coat - although I put one on anyway.  It has only been 3 days and I have received multiple compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make it even more fun, I put a layer of Sally Hansen Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Polish (Diamonds color) on top of two nails on each hand.  Looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed two coats (but, this is usually the case for me).  And, as another poster said, this color is a little messy (more so than the other Sally Hansen Xtreme colors I have tried, for some reason).  I am pretty good at painting my nails, but this blue got on the skin on the sides of my nails.  No worries though!  If this happen, just let it dry fully, then scrape it off with your nails under water.  A little soap helps too.  I usually do this in the shower the morning after painting my nails.</li>
    <li> This polish is the perfect shade of blue.  I love the Xtreme Wear line because it really lasts on my nails, even when I am rough on them - I can usually make the polish last for about 5 days.  Blue It is a vibrant shade of cobalt blue with a really slight shimmer to it.  One coat is enough to cover my nails sufficiently.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This color has been hard to find in stores, glad I found it online. Quality and color are good too!</li>
    <li> I use this for fly tying.  It puts a shiny durable head on my flies.  Stands up to water, rocks and teeth and still looks good. Keeps the tying thread from coming undone. Works great.</li>
    <li> Best and only color i wear. This kind doesnt chip easy, drys fast and smooth, and stays for week or so.</li>
    <li> my mom likes it very much</li>
    <li> luv luv luv this color</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this color!!! The first coat looks JUST like the bottle. No need for excessive coats and dries pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Perfect, she loves it!</li>
