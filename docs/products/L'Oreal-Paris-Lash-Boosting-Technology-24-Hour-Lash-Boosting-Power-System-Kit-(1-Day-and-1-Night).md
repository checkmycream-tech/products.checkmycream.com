      <li>This product is wonderful.  </li>

      <li>And the mascara is awesome too!</li>
      <li>:-D  </li>
      <li>This is a great product!</li>
      <li>but Amazon has the best prices if you can wait for it to be mailed.  </li>
      <li>They work, but use the primer at night and in the morning to get the best results.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I will continue to purchase L&#x27;Oreal lower priced but still wonderful mascaras.</li>
      <li>This Loreal Lash Extend is the BEST mascara product I have ever came across &amp; at an awesome price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>great deal for the price!</li>
      <li>what a great deal on Amazon!!</li>
      <li>Therefore, I would probably not purchase it at a retail price of $14.95 unless it was on a great sale</li>
      <li>I have used both of these products before and they work great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with my results.  </li>

      <li>and im happy with the product</li>
      <li>I have used this mascara before though and the duo is great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with this item also.  </li>
      <li>The mascara is also great for making my lashes appear longer and fuller.  </li>
      <li>Great price, others gave it good review, but I see it&#x27;s been discontinued and can&#x27;t help</li>
      <li>I was most impressed with the how my lashes look now, even when I haven&#x27;t applied the serum or mascara.     </li>
      <li>I loved the boosting serum that you apply before putting the mascara on.</li>
      <li>It is quite a good product, considering the price.</li>
      <li>This produce produces good results.</li>
      <li>I have tried this combination before with good results.</li>
      <li>and you should be good.</li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality mascara that can guarantee your eyelashes to look longer and fuller, then this is what you need.</li>
      <li>but this mascara again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want longer lashes, so I ordered rapid lash, I read really good comments, I hope it works for me too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very easy system that makes my eyelashes look great.  </li>
      <li>I know beauty is pain, but I&#x27;d rather be able to see my beautiful eyes than have them burned out for the sake of eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Great budget friendly alternative for latisse!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>

      <li>Love this product!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
      <li>And let me say that this mascara is really phenomenal!</li>
      <li>I even took weekly pix to make sure I wasn&#x27;t fooling myself!  </li>

      <li>But the product seemed to feel quite nice on my lashes anyway.  </li>
      <li>these we nice to.</li>
      <li>So I pulled out my handy dandy cell phone and started looking up products for this problem on my amazon.</li>
      <li>Based on my experience, L&#x27;Oreal Paris Lash Boosting Power System is one of the best product for take care of your lashes because the mascara really improve your lashes appearence (longest),  while the primer  and the serum make your lashes healthiers (stronger and more growth) .</li>
      <li>I put a nice coat of the primer on, then the top coat...</li>
      <li>I am 66 years old &amp; still love to look my best with makeup.</li>
      <li>First of all, I used to have great eyelashes.</li>
      <li>&#x27;N Soft is the best mascara I have ever used, it does an amazing job of lengthening, it doesn&#x27;t clump, it has a great wand and it is soft and flexible on your lashes.  </li>
      <li>some of the claims and reviews on here made this stuff sound like a magic potion!</li>
      <li>Excellent product; have used this product previously always with Good Results.  </li>
      <li>have not been able to find a better deal anywhere.</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t even end up using the product, because I can&#x27;t be sure where it&#x27;s been before.</li>
      <li>I love the lash boosting serum.</li>
      <li>Thank you:)</li>
      <li>I love thi stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love the mascara, tho.</li>
      <li>The serum conditioner is ok.  </li>
      <li>This one boosts my skinny blonde eyelashes perfectly!</li>
      <li>The idea of \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; my eyelashes to prevent damage is really appealing to me.  </li>
      <li>For the cost, there are better products out there.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>I normally love this mascara, but cannot find it at any stores, so ordered it online.</li>
      <li>BUT WHY IT IS BETTER PRICED HERE</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I love Loreal mascara</li>
      <li>The price was much better here.</li>
      <li>I love the mascara.</li>
      <li>i use the mascara to bring out my lashes :)</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>just the serum.*(The mascara is a pretty good mascara</li>
      <li>As far as the mascara, it does a great job lengthening and it does provide some volume; and it washes off super easy!</li>
      <li>Other than that, these are two great products!</li>
      <li>and I still think for the money it is more than worth it!  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and now when I use mascara it looks like I have eyelashes again.  </li>
      <li>It stays on all day and the two step system is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The serum is easy to apply and I had no adverse effects from it to my eyes, which some products have done.  </li>
      <li>, it seemed to clump fairly easily.</li>
      <li>I will get back to being diligent because my lashes looked beautiful with the use of this product.</li>
      <li>The mascara goes on easily &amp; quickly which I love....</li>
      <li>I have noticed a HUGE difference in the amount of lashes that fall out while removing my make-up.</li>
      <li>At a retail price of $12.95 for just the mascara, I would again only purchase it if it was on a great sale</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are light colored</li>
      <li>For the review who complained about having to use more mascara to cover the primer, I haven&#x27;t had that problem, I use one coat of primer and one coat of mascara to cover it, and that works perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>Still, due to the fact that most of the women leaving the reviews sounded sane and intelligent, I based my purchase on their word and tried it out.</li>
      <li>I love them both; I won&#x27;t say that it has made my lashes \\&quot;thicker\\&quot;, which if you really read the packaging, the claim is for more healthy lashes, and that&#x27;s exactly what it delivers.</li>
      <li>The serum is extremely easy to apply and I quickly added applying before bed to my nightly routine.  </li>
      <li>I think it is worth the price!</li>
      <li>I finally found an very affordable way to have beautiful lashes without having to wear Falsies or having to pay an arm and a leg for a product that really works!!!</li>
      <li>you will have full, lush, amazing lashes.</li>
      <li>I bought since it was such a good buy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for the lash boosting serum. I love it! It&#x27;s easy to use, never irritates my eyes, and does actually seem to work. It seems to make my lashes darker, longer, and just overall more manageable (such as my lashes don&#x27;t clump together when I use mascara). The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the changes to my lashes aren&#x27;t permanent, so to get the results I mentioned, you need to use it every night.</li>
    <li> just received my product yesterday, and started to use it, then update my review when you see results. Than you</li>
    <li> It is not a lash booster. I used the product morning and evening for about 6 weeks and nada, zilch, zero, nothing changed with my eyelashes.  I was quite disappointed because I was hoping to have some eyelashes again.  You live and learn.</li>
    <li> As the previous reviewer mentioned I received this product through the Bzzzagens program and had the privilege of trying out the product ahead of the public.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with my results.  The serum is extremely easy to apply and I quickly added applying before bed to my nightly routine.  I haven&#x27;t had an adverse reactions or anything whatsoever to the serum and have definitely seen that my lashes appear thicker, longer, and stronger.  The mascara is also great for making my lashes appear longer and fuller.  The two step process is easy and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that this mascara also seems to last a really long time where other products I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t.  The mascara also comes off extremely easy with a little eye makeup remover, much better than other mascaras I&#x27;ve previously used.  I highly recommend both products, you won&#x27;t be sorry :-)</li>
    <li> I too received this product as a BzzAgent which included a free trial of the night serum and daily treatment and mascara. I have always purchased department store mascara in the past so I was a bit cynical of a \\&quot;regular mascara.\\&quot; I quickly realized the great quality of this product - and for about half the price of the department store mascara that I normally purchase. Pros about this product: keeps lashes soft, no clumping, no flaking, no smearing and no brittle lashes. Normally my lashes would be stiff at the end of the day and I felt like I was losing lashes when I would take my makeup off. Not the case here. I would definitely recommend it - I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast delivery..</li>
    <li> Great budget friendly alternative for latisse! My lashes have at least doubled, and gotten thicker, longer, &amp; darker. I have been using it on my eyebrows and they have thickened up as well! I will def continue  to use it!</li>
    <li> I am Buzzing about L&#x27;Oreal Paris Concentrated Lash Boosting Serum and Double Extend Lash Boosting Mascara (together &#x3D; Regimen) because I am a BuzzAgent and was sent these two items to try for 4 weeks and Bzz about them.  I started using both items on 12-28-09 and have used them every day up to present day 2-5-10 and will continue to use them until empty.  The serum is easy to apply and I had no adverse effects from it to my eyes, which some products have done.  However, I have not seen any dramatic or even much noticeable change to my lashes with the use of the serum.  Therefore, I would probably not purchase it at a retail price of $14.95 unless it was on a great sale and I had a high coupon and/or rebate for it.  I do enjoy using the mascara with a lash booster primer on one end (and color coded white) and lengthening topcoat on the other (blue).  Again, no remarkable change in the length of my lashes, but they did look nice.  At a retail price of $12.95 for just the mascara, I would again only purchase it if it was on a great sale and I had a high coupon and/or rebate for it.  Otherwise, I will continue to purchase L&#x27;Oreal lower priced but still wonderful mascaras.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product.  The idea of \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; my eyelashes to prevent damage is really appealing to me.  I also though the idea of using a primer before mascara sounded like a great idea as well.  I started by applying the serum which went on a little gooey and clumped my lashes together a little bit.  The applicator for the serum is really weird and hard to use.  I slept in the serum and when I woke up it was sort of peeling and flaking of my eyelashes and it looked pretty weird.  I washed all that off, re-applied the serum and went for the mascara.  I curled my lashes like I always do, then applied the primer.  I immediately started feeling skeptical about this product because it started clumping my eyelashes and made them extremely bright white.  Also the primer wand has short bristles and they are widely spaced. I let the primer dry for a few seconds then started to apply the black mascara.  White was a really poor choice of color for the primer because you have to apply quite a bit of mascara get it covered, at least two coats.  The mascara wand is a little fuller than the primer wand but not much.  By the end of this whole ordeal I had the spider eyes look and my eyelashes felt heavy and crunchy.  Later in the day I noticed a few spots of white that I had not covered.  Not wanting to give up on this product because I spent $15 I tried the whole process a number of different ways: without the serum, using very light primer, skipping the primer, using one coat of mascara, etc.  I really doubt the serum does any good, I have used it for a week and my eyelashes are the same (plus it is unpleasant to use.)  My advice would be, do not waste your money on this product.      I have used Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft Washable Mascara for at least five years.  Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft is the best mascara I have ever used, it does an amazing job of lengthening, it doesn&#x27;t clump, it has a great wand and it is soft and flexible on your lashes.  I&#x27;ve yet tofind anything that beats it.  AND it is only $5.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work in a short period of time, but after trying it for 2 months (used up both bottles), the differences are visible. It is definitely a product that I will keep buying!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product....some of the claims and reviews on here made this stuff sound like a magic potion! Still, due to the fact that most of the women leaving the reviews sounded sane and intelligent, I based my purchase on their word and tried it out. So I&#x27;ve been applying the serum faithfully day and night for only 21 days and much to my amazment and delight, my lashes are thicker and longer. I even took weekly pix to make sure I wasn&#x27;t fooling myself!  I have started to develop a little bit of sensitivity during the day, so after day 30, I&#x27;m going to cut down, and just apply at night to maintain my new-found lashes. I recommend it wholeheartedly...and at this price...why wait!</li>
    <li> I received this mascara as a BzzAgent as well.  I find this to be a very high quality mascara.  However, I don&#x27;t really care for the serum.  It gets clumpy and then flakes off.  I love the two steps to the mascara, it makes my lashes look much fuller than normal.  It&#x27;s a very easy system that makes my eyelashes look great.  I&#x27;m just not sure I would pay the price for this system, as it is quite expensive.  I&#x27;m used to paying around $3 to $4 for mascara, but $20?  That&#x27;s a bit steep for my taste.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality mascara that can guarantee your eyelashes to look longer and fuller, then this is what you need.</li>
    <li> Great price, others gave it good review, but I see it&#x27;s been discontinued and can&#x27;t help but wonder if it&#x27;s because it only worked for a scant few.  I&#x27;m home recovering from surgery, so had plenty of time to use it. I used to have nice lashes and very motivated to use any product as often as I should to get them back. I used religiously day and night and see ZERO change in almost two months.</li>
    <li> I can tell a pretty significant difference in my lashes since I started using the product.  I definitely can tell a difference in the number of lashes I loose when taking off my make up, rubbing my eyes etc.  I can also tell that my lashes look longer and thicker than they did before I started using this product.  I can definitely tell a difference in the fullness of my lashes and the bald spot I had has been drastically minimized and they look longer.  I did not experience any discoloration to my eyes while using this product like you can with other similar products that darken the lashes.  I also did not experience any stinging or irritation to my eyes which was a concern for me going in since I have very sensitive skin and eyes.  I also saw about at 25% increase in the length of my lashes when useing the mascara.</li>
    <li> I have been using both products for about 2 months now. I love them both; I won&#x27;t say that it has made my lashes \\&quot;thicker\\&quot;, which if you really read the packaging, the claim is for more healthy lashes, and that&#x27;s exactly what it delivers. If you are good about using the serum every night, and the primer everyday you will see results. I have noticed a HUGE difference in the amount of lashes that fall out while removing my make-up. I used to lose 2-5 lashes a day, now I&#x27;m down to that many or less per WEEK. For the review who complained about having to use more mascara to cover the primer, I haven&#x27;t had that problem, I use one coat of primer and one coat of mascara to cover it, and that works perfectly for me. As far as the mascara, it does a great job lengthening and it does provide some volume; and it washes off super easy! Overall I am extremely satisfied with this product and will continue using it; it sure beats the price of Latisse, without the dark lines or iris pigmentation! Go for it!</li>
    <li> Not only do I use this on my eyelashes, I use them to keep my eyebrows nice and full ! LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> All this product does is build up gummy gunk on your lashes. The proof is when you have \\&quot;cleansed\\&quot; your lashes with plain old water and compare them to the week before, the month before etc... The only \\&quot;extension\\&quot; you get is gunk on your lashes. It is NOT new growth of more lashes NOR is it longer lashes....just gunk build up that makes them look longer when you apply mascara, which BTW, they get all clumpy yucky. Yes, thats even waiting several minutes between \\&quot;coatings\\&quot;. Do NOT waste your money ladies!!</li>
    <li> I use coconut oil to remove my eye make up and that is helping grow my lashes.  I began using the lash boosting at night so I am not sure if my lashes are growing because of the coconut oil or the combination with the lash booster but something is working!  I LOVE Primer  that comes with this mascara.  I wish they sold the primer alone.  The mascara is nice and works well with the  primer. You can use any mascara with the  Primer.</li>
    <li> Recently, I received the opportunity to try these L&#x27;Oreal Paris products through BzzAgent.    The two products I received to try were L&#x27;Oreal Paris concentrated Lash Boosting Serum and L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend with Last Boosting Serum.    [See my before and after pics here: [..]    The serum promises to deliver fortified, nourished and strengthened lashes with daily use. The mascara promises longer, thicker, fuller lashes. Apply the serum to bare lashes, at night, and during the day under your mascara.    Well I have been testing these products for about a month now and the results are in!  Do they deliver? YES!    Before using the L&#x27;Oreal Lash serum, my lashes were very short and brittle. I noticed a difference in the first few days of use! My lashes already seemed longer and fuller. I also noticed less lashes falling out.    Generally I don&#x27;t wear mascara every day, so I didn&#x27;t use the Double Extend mascara every single day. But, on the days that I did apply it, I definitely noticed longer looking lashes! That is almost always the case when you use a primer though, which is included.    I was most impressed with the how my lashes look now, even when I haven&#x27;t applied the serum or mascara.     Since they have you applying 3 separate coats (serum, primer and mascara), it seemed to clump fairly easily. Allow the serum to dry before using the mascara and apply a light coat of the primer so you don&#x27;t have to use as much mascara to cover it up and you should be good. Other than that, these are two great products!</li>
    <li> The mascara is simply average -- nothing special and no better than any other drug store mascara.  The conditioning lash product does add hydration to dry eye lashes and is easy to apply.  It is too early to say if it has improved my eyelashes to date.</li>
    <li> I have used both of these products before and they work great.  I ordered them on line due to the price was a lot cheaper than what I purchased them in the store..  They work, but use the primer at night and in the morning to get the best results.</li>
    <li> I tend to be critical of most products because they just do not hold up to their end of the deal. God knows I do by the amount of money I&#x27;m willing to fork out.   With that said, I only tried this because of some positive reviews on here (try to weed out the fakes), and the cost. I am pleasantly surprised with this product. I used it almost nightly for two weeks when I noticed growth. For me it took about two weeks to see a change. I&#x27;m going to say not quite a quarter an inch. But with eyelashes, that&#x27;s a big deal.   Note: I did not use the mascara stuff. I am a die hard fan of the wand mascara. I only used the serum.   So, 4 stars because I&#x27;m a difficult critic. To earn 5, the product must produce a miracle. :-D  It comes very close though. You won&#x27;t see a dramatic growth, but nonetheless there will be growth!  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> The product looked like was open when I got it so I was hesitant about using it. I have used this mascara before though and the duo is great.</li>
    <li> If you use this as directed religiously....you will be amazed! I honestly have used every mascara on the market. I am 66 years old &amp; still love to look my best with makeup. This Loreal Lash Extend is the BEST mascara product I have ever came across &amp; at an awesome price on Amazon. The mascara goes on easily &amp; quickly which I love....no work at all &amp; you will have full, lush, amazing lashes. Love this. Highly recommened by me.....you will not regret getting this, ladies....what a great deal on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Lashes were the same after continued use.  But the product seemed to feel quite nice on my lashes anyway.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My lashes have never been this long! I love this stuff. However you have to use it every night or it will not work.</li>
    <li> Thought it would! I liked the fact that it was a mascara with a serum on the other side. The white serum(first step)  leaves your eye lashes white and then when you apply the mascara (second step) it doesn&#x27;t cover up the white out your lashes. So you&#x27;re stuck with some random white spots in your lashes. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Excellent product; have used this product previously always with Good Results.  I do not understand why no major retailer carries this product any longer???</li>
    <li> The best mascara you need to try I&#x27;d &amp; and don&#x27;t need fake eyelashes ‰¥</li>
    <li> Just started using it, so don&#x27;t know how well it works yet, but it came highly recommended, so I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> After I stop using products for eyelash growth they left them brittle and short.&lt;br /&gt;Using this serum has revitalize them and nourish them back to life...</li>
    <li> The item/mascara was partially dried and very goopy. I assume the mascara was very old. I ended up having to toss it as there was no way i could wear it. I normally love this mascara, but cannot find it at any stores, so ordered it online. Bad idea</li>
    <li> I like it. It won&#x27;t magically make your lashes long or anything like that, but you will probably notice that they fall off a lot less</li>
    <li> Love this product! always buy it for my eyelashes. This is the only one mascara that i use and love it:) Thank you:)</li>
    <li> I received this item as a BzzAgent, and I have enjoyed using it for several weeks. While I haven&#x27;t seen immediate results, I have like the fact that my mascara goes on a lot smoother and when removing it, it seems like my lashes are stronger and there is less fall-out. I think it is worth the price!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product as apart of a buzz campaign. I enjoyed using it although I must admit I had a hard time remembering to apply it at night sometimes. I loved the boosting serum that you apply before putting the mascara on. I noticed a big difference in how long and thick my lashes appeared. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this full kit in the future but I would buy the daytime 2 step process.</li>
    <li> I received the L&#x27;Oreal Lash Boosting system from BzzAgent and tried it for 4 weeks. I love the mascara. It stays on all day and the two step system is easy to use.  I definitely notice the difference; my lashes are longer and feel thicker. I don&#x27;t always use the serum under the mascara because it almost makes my lashes feel TOO thick. I have thick lashes anyway, so if would probably be wonderful for someone with thin lashes who is looking to seriously plump them up!</li>
    <li> The serum conditioner is ok.  It wont hurt your lashes, however, I&#x27;m not sure it has a significant effect.  I really hate the mascara and primer combo.  These two products make my lashes clump and look spiky.  It&#x27;s also hard to cover all the white primer (especially without making more clumps) so there are these distracting white portions on my lashes. For the cost, there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> My fav live live this stuff my eyelashes r Long n healthy</li>
    <li> I believe it is a good product, good eye lash, nothing extraordinary, but it is at a really good price.</li>
    <li> I love thi stuff.  It helps extend my lashes, conditions them and keeps my mascara from smuding!  I&#x27;ve ordered it three times now.</li>
    <li> I love the lash boosting serum. I use it every night and it works. I didn&#x27;t like the primer and mascara. For me it was clumpy and stiff. The service and product was as promised and I would order from them again. But I would just get the serum.</li>
    <li> Does help lengthen lashes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much in the way of lashes and no product like this is going to help me. Now  I suppose if you had ample lashes it would work for you I odn&#x27;t know but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> First of all, I used to have great eyelashes. They were long and full and beautiful:) They&#x27;ve taken a lot of abuse over the years though, and in recent months I had started noticing that my eyelashes were falling out! I had no idea what to do! So I pulled out my handy dandy cell phone and started looking up products for this problem on my amazon. Every where I looked someone was trying to get me to spend money with promises of &amp;#34;miracle lashes&amp;#34; but every time I read the reviews they were bad! People complained of no effects, and high price, but the thing that caught my attention was the word, &amp;#34;burning.&amp;#34; After or in the process of applying their promising products, if even the tiniest little speck got in your eye it&#x27;d burn! I know beauty is pain, but I&#x27;d rather be able to see my beautiful eyes than have them burned out for the sake of eyelashes. So I searched, and searched, and since I&#x27;m addicted to amazon I searched further until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this stuff. It was very affordable, had wonderful reviews, and didn&#x27;t try to scam me. So when it finally arrived I was ecstatic! I ran to the bathroom, took a before picture, and started my twice a day application regimen. I did this eveyday for a month with just the serum.*(The mascara is a pretty good mascara I&#x27;m just way dedicated to my other one) At the end of the month I looked in the mirror and was pretty disappointed. They did look slightly different, a tad bit longer, a smidgen more full but not ravishing like I expected. I figured they had at least filled out a little and I had absolutely no lashes fall out while using this so it wasn&#x27;t a total bust but I was not happy with the results...&lt;br /&gt;Until I was getting ready to go out later in the day and put makeup on for the first time in a month and bam! My eyelashes were drop dead gorgeous! I use a lightweight mascara without all the added crap for the &amp;#34;long lash&amp;#34; look. So I knew it really was my eyelashes, but since I&#x27;m blonde My eyelashes are light colored so I couldn&#x27;t exactly see the results until then. I took an after picture and now I would swear by this product. I use it every day, twice a day still, and it still works if you put mascara on top!</li>
    <li> This product does seem to thicken eyelashes and the combination of the serum-containing bottom coat and mascara topcoat certainly lengthens them. I also like that the mascara is a basic black.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased twice was very diligent using the first time and lashes were beautiful, log and thick. But you have be consistent and if you are not you will see the difference. I will get back to being diligent because my lashes looked beautiful with the use of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the L&#x27;Oreal Lash Serum for 4 weeks and it has really made a difference in my lashes!..So when I saw this as a combo for such a low price I had to purchase it!...So after using the L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend I am totally sold on these two products!!!...Step 1 really does elongate and seperate all of your lashes!..And step 2 darkens and makes your lashes pop!!! I finally found an very affordable way to have beautiful lashes without having to wear Falsies or having to pay an arm and a leg for a product that really works!!!</li>
    <li> It works... My lashes are much longer.</li>
    <li> Yuck:( maybe since I&#x27;ve tried lancome power booster and star mascara I don&#x27;t like this one. Just clumped  up eyelashes. Soooo soooo sad as price was right.</li>
    <li> I bought since it was such a good buy and I love Loreal mascara.. I usually use the red and white set but these we nice to.</li>
    <li> CAN NOT FIND THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE CHEAPER. i TAKE THIS OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE DAILY. I COULD GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT BUT WHY IT IS BETTER PRICED HERE</li>
    <li> It is quite a good product, considering the price. My lashes did grew fuller and longer after about month and a half of using a serum everyday before bed (as advised). I use my mascara together with a length mascara inan order - primer, length mascara, loreal mascara. It seems like my lashes are full and long after the application</li>
    <li> Ive used so many mascaras in my life! From high end to drugstore!  I can definitely tell you that this mascara is one of my faves and the one I wear the most. It gives you the fake long lash look with buildable volume. The trick is putting the first step coat twice and dont let dry completly before adding and wiggling(slightly)the brush as you add the second step mascara. Gives you beautiful long voluminous lashes without absolutely no clumps!!! I will always have this mascara on stock! Tip:for fuller looking lashes add a second coat of the second step as well.</li>
    <li> great deal for the price! amazing price nice mascara and serum . very good price!!! I am getting ready to get a new one</li>
    <li> I placed this order making sure to check that it would be coming to me new, since this is an eye product I definitely don&#x27;t want something secondhand. However, when I received the package, the seal was broken and covered in lint and the package had clearly been opened before. There was dusty brown makeup/dirt residue all over and I didn&#x27;t even want to touch it. I probably won&#x27;t even end up using the product, because I can&#x27;t be sure where it&#x27;s been before.</li>
    <li> Based on my experience, L&#x27;Oreal Paris Lash Boosting Power System is one of the best product for take care of your lashes because the mascara really improve your lashes appearence (longest),  while the primer  and the serum make your lashes healthiers (stronger and more growth) .</li>
    <li> the seller is not honest, he should tell us this product is made in 2009 , so this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Lash Boosting totally overdate</li>
    <li> Applicator for serum is hard to position. Package was from CVS clearance - the stickers were still on it. Looked old and beat up. I wonder how long this item has been sitting around.</li>
    <li> This produce produces good results. I have tried this combination before with good results. The price was much better here.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking ok, even if it doesn&#x27;t work, at least it has mascara. Well, after using it for about two weeks, people would tell me I have long eyelashes! Even on days I wasn&#x27;t wearing mascara. And the mascara is awesome too! L&#x27;Oreal is my favourite drugstore brand of mascara and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed ;)&lt;br /&gt;~Samy</li>
    <li> I purchased this mascara and it  was not fresh enough. İt has dried out too fast . . . .</li>
    <li> of course you cant expect the product to work after one use, it gradually makes a difference each time you use it. I will say after days using this system i do see fullness and length in my lashes and im happy with the product :) i love the mascara the white primer to the black coat it really looks nice and almost natural to me... on the days where im lazy to do anything with my eyes i use the mascara to bring out my lashes :)</li>
    <li> My lashes fell out for no reason on  September 2012, Dr told me because the stress. My eye lashes are thin, really short  and slighly curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 2 months since December 2012, I the serum and also de mascara. I opted for this because the price and because I like l&#x27;oreal products, especially for my hair. I use the product every morning and night, the mascara during the day. I have to say the serum helps, my lashes did not fall out again. However  they do not look thicker nor fuller nor longer. If you use the serum, you have to use mascara because It looks like white lumps. Regarding the mascara I do not recommend it at all. It is not water proof, your eye lashes look and feel sticky. Definetely I would not but this mascara again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want longer lashes, so I ordered rapid lash, I read really good comments, I hope it works for me too. Anyways because I bought  two seeums, I plan to used during the nights to protect my lashes, I heard the effect of rapidlash just last while you are using it, so maybe combine both products can work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  .</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My eyelashes always fell out and they are very thin. After using the product for several months, my lashes are definitely fuller and they do not fall out very often!</li>
    <li> i have not used this consistently enough to know for sure whether i like it or not because my daughter has hidden it from me.  I love the mascara, tho.</li>
    <li> I got this kit to use while I allowed my lash extensions to naturally fall out. I&#x27;d had the extensions for about 6 months or more, but they were just getting to be too high maintenance, and too pricey. I&#x27;ve been using the serum at night and then the mascara by day. And let me say that this mascara is really phenomenal! I put a nice coat of the primer on, then the top coat... it&#x27;s so nice and velvety. Never clumpy, and makes my lashes look so nice and thick, I don&#x27;t even miss my extensions at all! My natural lashes are already pretty long, so I really wanted to achieve the fullness factor, and this stuff does that for sure. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It arrived in a timely manner and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Not sure if the lash cream will grow my lashes, but the primer works great for lengthening lashes for the mascara. The description of product title didn&#x27;t lead me to think there was primer, but love it that there is!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, and now when I use mascara it looks like I have eyelashes again.  A good little product, can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore,but I have used the lash conditioning product before and I still think for the money it is more than worth it!  Very reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I buy.  It conditions delicate lashes and makes applying the mascara very easy.  Doesn&#x27;t smear or leave any residue on under eye skin.  My sensitive eyes love it.  I like the night treatment too; my lashes don&#x27;t fall out much at all anymore and I&#x27;m really happy with this item also.  The price is right and you can purchase it anywhere but Amazon has the best prices if you can wait for it to be mailed.  I would definitely buy again and recommend to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite mascara. It really adds a lot of curve and length to your lashes without flaking at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to find a better deal anywhere. I have purchased it multiple times from Online Direct, and the seller has always shipped the goods in a timely manner and handled conflicts professionally.</li>
    <li> Well, I am not sure if this will make my lashes grow longer.  I take Travatan for glaucoma, so if my lashes get longer , it is probably the medicated eye drops.  BUT this product has changed.  When I first tried it, the white was hard to cover and my lashes looked gloopy.  It was also hard to wash off.  I actually lost lashes.  I decided to give it another try due to favourable reviews here and I am happy that I did.  The white glides on and is easily covered.  The black does not gloop and gives me incredibly defined, long and lush lashes.  I already have long lashes, and this mascara enhances them.  It washes off more or less easily, leaving my lashes feeling conditioned, not hard and brittle like before.  Even better, this mascara does not irritate my sensitive eyes.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> The same product in red container left me with spindly eye lashes.  This one boosts my skinny blonde eyelashes perfectly!</li>
    <li> I liked the mascare, but it dried out way too quickly, not sure how old it was already,  I wish it would have lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write a review. But I purchased this with the mindset that Amazon has never disappoint me. Have been using this about two weeks now, I don&#x27;t know if its working or not, but what i do know is that I stated losing my not too full lash. Thought I was rubbing my eye area too hard, but I woke up to see lash sitting on my cheeks (early evening thou,so I think the primer and the mascara is not agreeing with my lash, not sure cos when am taking my bath in the morning, at least 3 lashes falls off). I want to believe it works but my lashes are falling off!!!. Guess am gonna go back to eye-lite Mavala Switzerland. Just wanted to try something different and save money too but am paying for been cheap now. My poor lash</li>
