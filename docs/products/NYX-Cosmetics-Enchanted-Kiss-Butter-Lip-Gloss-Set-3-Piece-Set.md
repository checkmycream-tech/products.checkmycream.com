      <li>that I had no expectations for the rest, which I ended up loving more!</li>
      <li>The texture of the losses are really nice, not too sticky and silky feeling on your lips.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Apple Strudel-peachy/coral color, nice summer shade,</li>
      <li>I like the feel - not too sticky or greasy - and also a nice opaque tint.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&amp;Eacute;clair-my favorite out of the three, looks like bubblegum color but provides a nice purple/pink/faint plum tinted color that looks great with light eyes.</li>

      <li>And the merengue tastes amazing and is a light purplely color..</li>
      <li>love these, got them today 02/17/15.</li>
      <li>Either way, I&#x27;m really glad I ordered this colors.</li>
      <li>beautiful natural looking gloss 4</li>
      <li>The colors are a great, sheer wash and if you don&#x27;t like lipstick you can always just use a lip liner under these.</li>
      <li>Absolutely adore this product!!!</li>
      <li>pretty good nice colors not too sheer</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try out the peachy color,</li>
      <li>These are deff worth the $!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s hard to impress me unless something is absolutely incredible and over the top.</li>
      <li>I really love these colors and they came out very pigmented.</li>
      <li>I LOVE ❤ Nyx so much.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>more natural looking</li>
      <li>The meringue is the most pigmented out of all of them, like a bubble gum pink I love it.</li>
      <li>but they are all very subtle and look great!</li>
      <li>They feel great on your lips, they aren&#x27;t sticky and gritty like some other lip glosses, and they last a good while.</li>
      <li>They are smooth and lightweight, not heavy or greasy and provide just right amount of color.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more</li>
      <li>they are so pretty on.</li>
      <li>Definitely one of my favorite drugstore lip gloss.</li>
      <li>They are really pigmented and they are exactly what they look like in the picture</li>
      <li>but they are pretty nice little glosses.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it arrive quickly, in great condition and were clearly not used.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product, but for me it did not work.</li>
      <li>this lip gloss makes your lips very sticky</li>
      <li>Shipped suprisingly fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just really bummed out</li>
      <li>now i&#x27;m wondering what the real set is supposed to be.</li>
      <li>The Apple strudel is more of a peachy pink</li>
      <li>the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I chose these set of colors because I really wanted to try out the peachy looking color (Apple Strudel) but the color payoff wasn&#x27;t very noticeable on my lips.</li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not 100% happy with is that they aren&#x27;t completely opaque on my lips, but I&#x27;ve heard other people say they are for them, so it could just be me.</li>
      <li>Other than that I love</li>
      <li>I was happy to get these in the mail a few days in advance of what the expected delivery date was.</li>
      <li>the creme brulee is just a hint of a nude light pink color..</li>
      <li>was exact, a subtle pale pink nice color I liked it.</li>
      <li>Very classy with a hint of attitude.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Pie-nice red color, not too bold, a wearable red, not too orangey, will wear for bolder looks</li>
      <li>The only thing that i got upset about was this was clearly part of a set that wasn&#x27;t sold together.</li>
      <li>It left a very unnatural chalky/milky pink color to my lips.</li>

<li> They are one of few lip items that don&#x27;t cause my lips to dry out and peel and they&#x27;re extremely affordable.</li>
<li> There is also an odd taste and smell to the product for me.</li>
<li> the peachy color didn&#x27;t show, maybe my lips are a little too dark?</li>
<li> I was a little upset with the price for these</li>
<li> They&#x27;re not sticky like typical lip glosses!</li>
<li> I am a lip gloss fanatic</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely adore this product!!! Great shades for all skin types. Very classy with a hint of attitude. Best lipgloss ever.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> love these, got them today 02/17/15.</li>
    <li> Diva lip queen gives approval.  These are great. For the price I can&#x27;t believe the quality,  smell, non stickiness and lasting power. Will definitely buy more</li>
    <li> I loveee these glosses! They feel great on your lips, they aren&#x27;t sticky and gritty like some other lip glosses, and they last a good while. The only thing I&#x27;m not 100% happy with is that they aren&#x27;t completely opaque on my lips, but I&#x27;ve heard other people say they are for them, so it could just be me. But the colors are great, and they go beautifully over lipstick. Great product!</li>
    <li> I really love these colors and they came out very pigmented. Good buy</li>
    <li> Amazing service! Great product! Very Happy!!!!!</li>
    <li> I freakin love these glosses,so pigmented</li>
    <li> These are deff worth the $! I love all of them. I was looking for just the creme brulee, but I saw the set of 3 for double the price of one so I figured why not? Their so smooth and taste good too...the creme brulee is just a hint of a nude light pink color..beautiful natural looking gloss 4 anyone! The Apple strudel is more of a peachy pink that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been looking 4. And the merengue tastes amazing and is a light purplely color..but they are all very subtle and look great! Highly recommend!!! I can nevr find perfect glosses and I&#x27;d say this is my all time fave set!</li>
    <li> I received these today &amp; as soon as I got them in the mail I just had to try them out! I chose these set of colors because I really wanted to try out the peachy looking color (Apple Strudel) but the color payoff wasn&#x27;t very noticeable on my lips. Next color I tried was the pale pink color (Merengue) the color pay off for this gloss was exact, a subtle pale pink nice color I liked it. The final color is more of a nude (Creme Brulee) the perfect nude if I many point out! I was so excited to try out the peachy color, that I had no expectations for the rest, which I ended up loving more! The texture of the losses are really nice, not too sticky and silky feeling on your lips. I&#x27;m just really bummed out the peachy color didn&#x27;t show, maybe my lips are a little too dark? Maybe if I pop some lip concealer on, the color might actually show. Or maybe just mix it with another color. Either way, I&#x27;m really glad I ordered this colors. I think I just might buy the other set of colors(:</li>
    <li> These lip glosses are great. They are really pigmented and they are exactly what they look like in the picture I would defiantly re-purchase</li>
    <li> Love the colors, and so did my daughters. Colors are as advertised, but this is your typical lip gloss that you will need to apply several times a day. Does not have a long last wear.</li>
    <li> I love these, they are such nice colors work well, very happy with my purchase they are so pretty on.</li>
    <li> I am a lip gloss fanatic so it&#x27;s hard to impress me unless something is absolutely incredible and over the top. I like the lip glosses. I like the feel - not too sticky or greasy - and also a nice opaque tint.</li>
    <li> Definitely one of my favorite drugstore lip gloss. This set is a steal. Apple strudel is incredibly flattering. I would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I was happy to get these in the mail a few days in advance of what the expected delivery date was. The only thing that i got upset about was this was clearly part of a set that wasn&#x27;t sold together. It says on the back that it&#x27;s not for individual sale, which it was, so now i&#x27;m wondering what the real set is supposed to be. Other than that, it arrive quickly, in great condition and were clearly not used. The colors are a great, sheer wash and if you don&#x27;t like lipstick you can always just use a lip liner under these.</li>
    <li> pretty good nice colors not too sheer</li>
    <li> I hate making a bad review but I personally didnot like this lip gloss makes your lips very sticky and I don&#x27;t see any shine to it</li>
    <li> I found the shades to be oddly pigmented, especially the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; shade. It left a very unnatural chalky/milky pink color to my lips. The texture is very sticky, reminiscent of glosses in the past. There is also an odd taste and smell to the product for me. I really wanted to like this product, but for me it did not work. It promptly went into a drawer, forgotten.</li>
    <li> I LOVE ❤ Nyx so much.  The cost was so affordable . the shipping was fast. Only compliant about nyx is that is doesn&#x27;t last long on the lips 👄. Other than that I love ❤ it</li>
    <li> Shipped suprisingly fast. Love these colors. The meringue is the most pigmented out of all of them, like a bubble gum pink I love it.</li>
    <li> Not even fair, stupid buggy got them</li>
    <li> These lip glosses are wonderful.  They are one of few lip items that don&#x27;t cause my lips to dry out and peel and they&#x27;re extremely affordable.</li>
    <li> I love these! They&#x27;re not sticky like typical lip glosses! So perfect for summer time!</li>
    <li> I was a little upset with the price for these but they are pretty nice little glosses. These glosses are not too sticky. They are smooth and lightweight, not heavy or greasy and provide just right amount of color. I have fair/light skin and Hazel/bluish eyes and dyed medium red hair and these work well for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Apple Strudel-peachy/coral color, nice summer shade, more natural looking&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Pie-nice red color, not too bold, a wearable red, not too orangey, will wear for bolder looks&lt;br /&gt;&amp;Eacute;clair-my favorite out of the three, looks like bubblegum color but provides a nice purple/pink/faint plum tinted color that looks great with light eyes. These do need to be reapplied after eating or drinking.</li>
    <li> I love these lip butter</li>
