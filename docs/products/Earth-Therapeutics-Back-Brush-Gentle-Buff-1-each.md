### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;It is very securely attached to its handle and holds a goodly amount of water/sudsy water for washing.</li>
      <li>The buffs foam up my cleanser nicely.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought it was great.</li>
      <li>I think a brush would have been better.</li>
      <li>good price and fast shipping</li>
      <li>They changed the style and went cheap, cheap, cheap.  </li>
      <li>Durable, cheap cost, and does what it entails.</li>
      <li>The eight bucks shown is indeed the MSRP and you can get it here on Amazin&#x27; Amazon for that with free s/h</li>
      <li>It is cheaply attached to the brush head and basically glued on.</li>
      <li>As others have said, it&#x27;s more like a sponge, which is good because you don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; your back.</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find this replacement, same brand, conveniently available on Amazon</li>
      <li>I loved the brush the 1st time I used it but the 2nd time the handle fell off!</li>
      <li>looked like it would really do a good job scrubbing the back.  </li>
      <li>I wish it had a more curved handle for when you want to use it on your back, but other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>If you have really tender skin, this would be fine.  </li>
      <li>Only problem is its got a sponge end, which is my own fault for trying it.</li>
      <li>I think this is more like a soft sponge than a &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I found it well built - sturdy wood handle, but would&#x27;ve liked it bigger.    </li>
      <li>It is easily rinsed and dries out nicely when squeezed and hung upside down to drip-dry in the shower via suction cup hook.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it after the first usage.  </li>
      <li>Please make a better back brush.</li>
      <li>or you can go to your local bed bath and beyond with a 5 bucks off 15 coupon for more savings.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I would like better about this brush is if the handle was all wood without the plastic rubbery grip.  </li>
      <li>I will continue using the Earth Therapeutics buffs as I like they get me thoroughly clean and exfoliated while soothing not reddening my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>For my sensitive dry skin, these buffs are perfect for just the right amount of exfoliating dead skin cells without scratching or damaging my skin!  </li>
      <li>I really like [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The backscrubber gently cleaned my skin with no discomfort.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The person using this item from Earth Therapeutics really really likes it a lot.</li>
      <li>While the brush appears to be well made, it does not provide enough friction to effective \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; your back.  </li>
      <li>The handle is nice and long, but I prefer my back brush.</li>
      <li>Has a nice roughness for scrubbing your back and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>It is so far very durable.</li>
      <li>I searched for a long time to find this back brush many years ago.</li>
      <li>They have just the right amount of give to go over curves such as shoulder blades.  </li>
      <li>I do not want to buy a new one every month</li>
      <li>What a pretty back scrubber . .</li>
      <li>It is not as rough as the loofah or even the bath mitt - both of which are primarily designed for standard exfoliating.</li>
      <li>This item is not as soft as terry cloth or standard sponge but is not as much of a skin irritant like a loofah.</li>
      <li>My husband has a broad muscular back.  </li>
      <li>This was purchased for a relative with severe upper and lower limb spasticity so that they could wash themsemselves in various areas including sensitive skin zones, armpit under paralyzed limb and so forth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this last year; had to dispose of it this summer. Living in the Northeast, showering sometimes twice a day, the dry winters made my back very dry so I wanted something to wash my back with a moisturizing soap. As others have said, it&#x27;s more like a sponge, which is good because you don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; your back. I found it well built - sturdy wood handle, but would&#x27;ve liked it bigger.    Also, I left it in the shower... where else would you leave a shower brush. After 6 months, it became brown stained with mold. The sponge is very absorbent, and even if you wring it out, stays wet all day... not good.</li>
    <li> This back brush was way too long for me (I am 5 feet tall) and was very difficult to use because it felt like a lead weight after 2 or 3 minutes. The sponge tip is also a poor design because it creates mildew like CRAZY. Essentially, bacteria gets trapped inside the sponge and the next time you use it you are just rubbing that all over yourself. Gross.</li>
    <li> This item is junk.  It came in two pieces....the head will not stay on the handle.  Dont waste your money on this one!</li>
    <li> While the brush appears to be well made, it does not provide enough friction to effective \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; your back.  I stopped using it after only 1 week.</li>
    <li> Product is what it shows. Durable, cheap cost, and does what it entails. Only problem is its got a sponge end, which is my own fault for trying it. I think a brush would have been better.</li>
    <li> I loved the brush the 1st time I used it but the 2nd time the handle fell off! It is cheaply attached to the brush head and basically glued on. Don&#x27;t waste your money for a one-time-use product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for shower use and putting lotion on. It does what you would expect. Its a little rough...I prefer since I use it to exfoliate. Overall, I would recommend, the price could have been a little bit lower. But I like it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a relative with severe upper and lower limb spasticity so that they could wash themsemselves in various areas including sensitive skin zones, armpit under paralyzed limb and so forth. A loofah on a stick was also purchased and a bath mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously the person had used a synthetic sponge-on-a-plastic-stick from a medical supply/accessability items store. The sponge on that stupidly expensive \\&quot;medical\\&quot; item promptly fell off within a few weeks of daily use, constituting somewhat of a rip off of disabled persons with limited income, if I might say so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person using this item from Earth Therapeutics really really likes it a lot. It is not as rough as the loofah or even the bath mitt - both of which are primarily designed for standard exfoliating. This item is not as soft as terry cloth or standard sponge but is not as much of a skin irritant like a loofah. You would need to scrub with a very firm pressure to get it to rub like a loofah or mitt does with minimal pressure. It exfoliates a little but won&#x27;t \\&quot;rub raw\\&quot; delicate skin unless you are really rubbing hard or over and over and over the same spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very securely attached to its handle and holds a goodly amount of water/sudsy water for washing. It is easily rinsed and dries out nicely when squeezed and hung upside down to drip-dry in the shower via suction cup hook. It is so far very durable.</li>
    <li> My eczema and very dry skin made taking showers uncomfortable.  ordered this back scrubber/sponge about 5 weeks ago. At first I thought it was great. The backscrubber gently cleaned my skin with no discomfort. Last week I noticed a dark stain forming, I&#x27;m assuming is it mildew. The back sponge is now in my garbage can. I do not want to buy a new one every month so I will have to find an alternate product that lasts at least a few months.</li>
    <li> My husband has a broad muscular back.  I searched for a long time to find this back brush many years ago. I was delighted to find this replacement, same brand, conveniently available on Amazon</li>
    <li> Has a nice roughness for scrubbing your back and lasts a long time.  I purchased my second one after the other one wore out.</li>
    <li> I think this is more like a soft sponge than a &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34;.  If you have really tender skin, this would be fine.  The handle is nice and long, but I prefer my back brush.</li>
    <li> What a pretty back scrubber . . . looked like it would really do a good job scrubbing the back.  Unfortunately, after about 7-10 uses, the whole thing fell apart.  The head with scrubber is attached to the handle with just a staple. I simply don&#x27;t get why companies make such poorly constructed junk.</li>
    <li> Handle broke the second time I used it. Very disappointing! I would not recommend any one to buy this brush.</li>
    <li> This item was pictured with a hand grip on the handle when I purchased it.  It did not have a hand grip on the handle when it arrived.  Not happy with the bait and switch.</li>
    <li> I really like [[ASIN:B001ET77QG Earth Therapeutics Body Sponge, Exfoliating, 1 each (Pack of 4)]] and this is one on a wooden handle so that you can reach your upper back by yourself.  For my sensitive dry skin, these buffs are perfect for just the right amount of exfoliating dead skin cells without scratching or damaging my skin!  They have just the right amount of give to go over curves such as shoulder blades.  The buffs foam up my cleanser nicely.  The only thing I would like better about this brush is if the handle was all wood without the plastic rubbery grip.  The eight bucks shown is indeed the MSRP and you can get it here on Amazin&#x27; Amazon for that with free s/h or you can go to your local bed bath and beyond with a 5 bucks off 15 coupon for more savings.  I&#x27;ve also seen Earth Therapeutics at Kohls and my local drugstores.  I will continue using the Earth Therapeutics buffs as I like they get me thoroughly clean and exfoliated while soothing not reddening my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> good price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> They changed the style and went cheap, cheap, cheap.  The old model had a comfort grip and a sponge under the loofah making it work better, this is awful.  Doesn&#x27;t get foamy with soap and just glides over the skin where the other model felt like it was getting into the skin layers and working!  Bad judgement, oh and the rope to hang it came off after one day.  Please make a better back brush.</li>
    <li> I wish it had a more curved handle for when you want to use it on your back, but other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> My son used this brush for bath time when he had a broken arm and had trouble reaching his back with one arm.  The brush was inexpensive and it did the trick.</li>
    <li> Product I received wasn&#x27;t as pictured and one was defective.  Won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> The brush was harsh and scratched my skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it after the first usage.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would want a brush like this.</li>
