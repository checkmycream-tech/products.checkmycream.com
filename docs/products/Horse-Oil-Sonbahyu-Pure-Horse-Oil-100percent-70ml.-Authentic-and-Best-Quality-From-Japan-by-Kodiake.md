    <li> it helps me to remove the allergy marks, recommend this product to whoever need to get rid of marks and scars.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing I dislike is the smell of it. What I did is to put few drops of tea tree oil together when I applying it onto my skin, so it covers the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using horse oil for two years now and it is life changing . I ran out for a while and my skin missed it ! I noticed that my white heads and blackheads are minimized and wrinkles are gone! will never go without as I will put this on repeat . This is my favorite brand % authentic !</li>

    <li> Horrible product.  This is made of oil from 100% slaughtered horse.  Disgust that Amazin carries it.  Maybe this is from the same slaughterhouse they torture dogs to make them tastier for eating?</li>
