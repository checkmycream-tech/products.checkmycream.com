### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is the GREATEST THING EVER!  </li>
      <li>Bottom line girls, this razor is the best out there.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for travel, cause you just bring one unit, not the razor and the shave gel, which is unbeleivably bulky!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>I have never cut myself shaving and my legs feel great after.  </li>
      <li>When I got myself a Venus that was designed not to nick or cut, it worked great, but it did scrape sometimes</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to do as good of a job on my armpits.</li>
      <li>I do think they give me a good shave on my legs.    </li>
      <li>That doesn&#x27;t happen too often in my area, but when it does I am one happy camper &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Very pleased as I&#x27;m a longtime Intuition user</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I could still find one!  </li>
      <li>This is SO much better than my venus razor!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Nice design of the razor itself.  </li>
      <li>I picked the Intuition because I really liked the idea of having the soap and shaver in</li>
      <li>and man was I loving it.</li>
      <li>also like that it glides along the leg very smoothly.</li>
      <li>love the shaver .only</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I just bought this for a trip in like 3 weeks, but after trying it, i think i am going to be using it a lot more.  </li>
      <li>It is comfortable, and no nicks or cuts!</li>
      <li>Now I love this razor and have no plans to give it up.  </li>
      <li>Totally comfortable!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I agree with the reviews they are pricey, but I do think they shave better than the cheaper ones</li>
      <li>I truly appreciate that the Intuition razor does what it advertises and I am SO glad it was invented.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
      <li>In fact you&#x27;ll probably spend more.</li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>Love this razor very smooth, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought it was great because it was so smooth to run up my legs</li>
      <li>I originally bought this for a summer vacation in about a week or two, but I wanted to use it first to make sure i liked it, and I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot easier to use than what I&#x27;ve been doing before (although I shall say that cheap hair conditioner works a lot better than shaving cream on my legs :)  )   </li>
      <li>This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, with no razor burn or drag I orginally bought it for traveling</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to take shaving cream, but loved it so much I threw out my Venus.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
      <li>main \\&quot;pro\\&quot; of this razor is that, in my opinion, it gives a good, close shave.</li>
      <li>I love that I can use it with the shower head on full blast, something I could never do when using creams or gels.</li>
      <li>Love this product so very much, It&#x27;s like a dream to be able to lather, moisturize, and shave in one swipe.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and shave 1-2 times a week.  </li>
      <li>You can buy these on eBay for cheap.</li>
      <li>and I still get smooth shave.</li>
      <li>It works great, I&#x27;ll never go back to using creams or gels.</li>
      <li>It looked like a cheap disposable razor that you can find at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no scraping or irritation, it just glides smoothly along your skin.</li>
      <li>It gives a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Even on the smooth sections of my legs, the razor catches and skips, and I am stubbly by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s convenient to be able to hang the razor right in the shower from the suction-cup hook.</li>
      <li>It gives a great shave and love the fact that the fact that the shaving cream is basically built in (I share a bathroom with other college girls, and as you can imagine, space is a premium).  </li>
      <li>With the Intutition it&#x27;s easy to do quick touch ups.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super quick!  </li>
      <li>I am sensitive to fragrance, so I was thrilled to see \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; on the package.</li>
      <li>Hanging it in the shower means you can grab it and spend five minutes giving your legs a quick going-over as you need.</li>
      <li>This product deserves an honest 2.5 stars - it&#x27;s a great idea that&#x27;s been hamstrung by a poor finished design and overexuberant pricing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen them pretty cheap online too.</li>
      <li>Super fast and easy.  </li>
      <li>For women who don&#x27;t like shaving because of the time and mess, the convenience is great.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, I have never cut myself using this shaver as opposed to regular raizors....</li>
      <li>It is usually a rare occasion that I cut myself while shaving.  </li>
      <li>I love that it glides smoothly over the skin, I&#x27;ve never nicked or cut myself like I have with traditional shaving.</li>
      <li>It is true that the shaving bar runs out fast on the razor side</li>
      <li>I really liked the Silk Effects, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find the blades lately.</li>
      <li>I have lots of the old cheap razors still</li>
      <li>Arrived exactly as pictured—same package, color, and cartridge.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>The old style Schick Intuition seems to fit the hand better, especially in the shower according to my Wife.  </li>
      <li>I also think they mositurize pretty well.    </li>
      <li>Just a tip, get the old style while they are still available.</li>
      <li>Plus, If you miss a spot, you can easily just go back over again.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cheaper on Ebay, but do I really want 72 blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and red bumps are no longer a burden.</li>
      <li>Shaves very close.  </li>
      <li>Then I looked really close at the razor...</li>
      <li>(what genius is responsible for that bit of designing??).</li>
      <li>I go through them so fast</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy that it actually lathers and moisturizes as I shave.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, but the skin conditioning solid didn&#x27;t give me any problems, and the shave was mostly nick-free.</li>
      <li>I am a pretty cheap person and decided this was worth splurging a little</li>
      <li>Since its okay to get wet, you don&#x27;t have to worry about stepping out of the shower!  </li>
      <li>I am extremely dissapointed in this product, as are most of my friends who have tried it.  </li>
      <li>When I use to shave with my Venus and shaving cream I always come out missing a certain spots (mostly the knee area)</li>
      <li>Certainly well worth the extra cost.</li>
      <li>but then after I shaved my whole leg and felt with my hands where I need to go back over for missed spots, I had to re-do almost my whole leg!</li>
      <li>The soap wears down very quickly.</li>
      <li>It lasts MUCH longer, smoother shave, I only have to shave my leg once to get it shaved, it doesn&#x27;t take that much time to apply shaving lotion, and I can use it for my bikini areas and underarm.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be able to lather and shave within the same device is extremely convenient--especially when used in the shower or travelling.</li>
      <li>All I can say is, Wow!</li>
      <li>find that the average refill lasts in good condition (with soap on the sharp side of the blades) for maybe 6 uses; after that, the only soap is left on the dull side of the blades, where it doesn&#x27;t do any good</li>
      <li>So halfway using the brand new refill, the lotion part completely broke off the razor making it unusable.  </li>
      <li>But, the intuition let&#x27;s me save time because it&#x27;s easy to shave all you need is a bit of water and your set it totally beats dry shaving!</li>
      <li>While I think it gives a better shave than the Venus, it&#x27;s not a very good value.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using cheap razors, like the ones you get at the Dollar Store, for a few years now.</li>
      <li>Wow where do I start???</li>
      <li>The divine is old news now.  </li>
      <li>I am a 35 year old woman who has been shaving for over 20 years.  </li>
      <li>After mutilating my legs with the cheap blades I finally broke down and purchased the Intuition razor.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, the moisturizer bar wears down unevenly, but I found that holding the razor at a slightly more upright angle (vs more parallel to the leg) helps the front not wear down so fast.  </li>
      <li>had problems reaching some angles with it, especially when the soap was new.  </li>
      <li>Way overpriced, if you ask me, especially since they don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can shave really fast, it only takes a second.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The old style Schick Intuition seems to fit the hand better, especially in the shower according to my Wife.  Why Schick changed to the &amp;#34;potato masher&amp;#34; style, I&#x27;ll never know.  Just a tip, get the old style while they are still available.</li>
    <li> Nice design of the razor itself.  The moisurizer cracks &amp; breaks, though, after 2 or 3 shaves which renders the razor useless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money (and that&#x27;s a lot of money for some defective blades!)</li>
    <li> I hated shaving anywhere on my body. I would always nick my legs and really hated shaving. Intuition razor has made me WANT to shave. I LOVE IT!!! It makes me want to sing in the shower and I really enjoy that it actually lathers and moisturizes as I shave. My skin is smooth and red bumps are no longer a burden. I truly appreciate that the Intuition razor does what it advertises and I am SO glad it was invented. The price for the blades are a bit expensive but it is sooo worth it!!</li>
    <li> Love this product so very much, It&#x27;s like a dream to be able to lather, moisturize, and shave in one swipe. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re shaving. There&#x27;s no scraping or irritation, it just glides smoothly along your skin. I love that I can use it with the shower head on full blast, something I could never do when using creams or gels. If I miss a spot, I can easily go back over it, it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. I&#x27;ve used it everywhere, legs, under arms, entire bikini area. It works great, I&#x27;ll never go back to using creams or gels. It&#x27;s such a time saver in the shower. One time I was really pressed for time and tried using it at the sink, it still worked, but I didn&#x27;t wet the area enough so it did scrape a bit.     I love that it glides smoothly over the skin, I&#x27;ve never nicked or cut myself like I have with traditional shaving. I remember with traditional razors even with ample amounts of lather I would still manage to cut myself somehow and it always pissed me off to see blood running down my leg. Not to mention it hurt.    When I got myself a Venus that was designed not to nick or cut, it worked great, but it did scrape sometimes and I still needed to lather up before using it. Needless to say, I threw my Venus in the trash once I got my hands on the Schick Intuition, no need to lather up, and I can shave with water running down my legs.     The refills can be expensive, but I&#x27;ve saved money buying them in bulk at club stores. I&#x27;ve seen them pretty cheap online too. Certainly well worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> I agree with every single thing that &#x27;prettynpink&#x27; wrote, and when i read that review it sounded like I wrote it! This is SO much better than my venus razor! It is comfortable, and no nicks or cuts! I can shave really fast, it only takes a second. Plus, If you miss a spot, you can easily just go back over again. I originally bought this for a summer vacation in about a week or two, but I wanted to use it first to make sure i liked it, and I love it! I&#x27;m not saving this for my vacation, I&#x27;m gonna use it from now on. It&#x27;s great for travel, cause you just bring one unit, not the razor and the shave gel, which is unbeleivably bulky! Another thing is that my legs don&#x27;t feel as prickley the next day.</li>
    <li> The Schick Intuition is one of those designs that make you think \\&quot;Why did no one come up with this before?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be able to lather and shave within the same device is extremely convenient--especially when used in the shower or travelling. If you&#x27;re still not sure. You can buy these on eBay for cheap. The Intuition retails for around $8, but can be bought for less than $4. Refills can be expensive, but can be cheaply found online too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright.  It gives a great shave and love the fact that the fact that the shaving cream is basically built in (I share a bathroom with other college girls, and as you can imagine, space is a premium).  However, the blades are almost $3 each a Kroger.  They&#x27;re cheaper on Ebay, but do I really want 72 blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had problems reaching some angles with it, especially when the soap was new.  While I think it gives a better shave than the Venus, it&#x27;s not a very good value.  I also noticed that my blade began to rust (I did not use it every day, so it lasted longer than it would have) when the soap began to run low.  I really liked the Silk Effects, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find the blades lately.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviews they are pricey, but I do think they shave better than the cheaper ones and I like not having to mess with shave cream. I also think they mositurize pretty well.    It is true that the shaving bar runs out fast on the razor side so I just turn it over and rub it over my leg and then shave.    It didn&#x27;t seem to do as good of a job on my armpits. I don&#x27;t know why. I have lots of the old cheap razors still so I use them for my armpits and the fancy razor for my legs. I do think they give me a good shave on my legs.    I am a pretty cheap person and decided this was worth splurging a little and I will stock up when they are on sale.     Maybe the Schick people will improve the design- who knows?</li>
    <li> I have never cut myself shaving and my legs feel great after.  I can shave in half the time with this.  The only downfall, is the cartridges do not last for very long.  I go through them so fast and they are not cheap.</li>
    <li> It was really hard for me to get over the cost of these refills, but then I found them a lot cheaper at the warehouse club.  Now I love this razor and have no plans to give it up.  Shaves very close.  Super fast and easy.  No worries about shave gel getting washed off in the shower before you&#x27;ve had a chance to shave.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the moisturizer bar wears down unevenly, but I found that holding the razor at a slightly more upright angle (vs more parallel to the leg) helps the front not wear down so fast.  I have fine hair and shave 1-2 times a week.  I go about a month between refills.</li>
    <li> This product is the GREATEST THING EVER!  I just bought this for a trip in like 3 weeks, but after trying it, i think i am going to be using it a lot more.  I would choose this razor over any other including my old venus divine.  The divine is old news now.  You don&#x27;t even feel like you are shaving!  It feels like you are running a bar of soap over your skin!  Totally comfortable! &lt;BR&gt;   &lt;BR&gt;  I got tired of using soap and shave gel after a while.  This way, i don&#x27;t waste any time putting any type of lather on!  It&#x27;s super quick!  Before, I had to have a mirror in the shower so i could see where i had put lather on to shave my underarms.  But now, it doesn&#x27;t matter because there is no lather to take off!  AND NO NICKS AT ALL!  Which is a miracle since I am only 13.&lt;br /&gt;  Some showers don&#x27;t have a ledge or dry area to put your leg while shaving so that it won&#x27;t get wet when you have all of the lather on.  Well, the intuition solves this problem.  Since its okay to get wet, you don&#x27;t have to worry about stepping out of the shower!  Bottom line girls, this razor is the best out there.  Even though it may be expensive, its well worth it.</li>
    <li> Once I saw the commercials for it I was determined to try it and man was I loving it. I hate shaving! When I use to shave with my Venus and shaving cream I always come out missing a certain spots (mostly the knee area) or sometimes I just get in my lazy mode and decide not to shave my legs for the next day which means no skirt for me. But, the intuition let&#x27;s me save time because it&#x27;s easy to shave all you need is a bit of water and your set it totally beats dry shaving! Now on when I wake up and decide last minute I want to wear a skirt I don&#x27;t have to worry about having to shave my legs the night before because now it takes me less than 5 minutes to do it in the morning and I love it! Trust me I have timed myself with five people in my house and one bathroom I have to limit my time!</li>
    <li> Wow where do I start??? Well I&#x27;ve been a Venus girl since they came out and I went to my Walmart to buy refills and I saw the Intuition so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because the concept appealed to me. So I go home and try it out. At first, I thought it was great because it was so smooth to run up my legs but then after I shaved my whole leg and felt with my hands where I need to go back over for missed spots, I had to re-do almost my whole leg! Then I looked really close at the razor...it&#x27;s cheap! It looked like a cheap disposable razor that you can find at the dollar store. But I decided to keep on trying it for the heck of it. The solid lotion was all gone by my 4th shave. My venus razors last me a month. The Intuition lasted me 1 1/2 weeks. I don&#x27;t want to be putting an expensive refill in every week and a half. So, since I had another refill that came with the razor, I thought I&#x27;d just use it up (I hate wasting things). So halfway using the brand new refill, the lotion part completely broke off the razor making it unusable.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned: I&#x27;m going back to my Venus. It lasts MUCH longer, smoother shave, I only have to shave my leg once to get it shaved, it doesn&#x27;t take that much time to apply shaving lotion, and I can use it for my bikini areas and underarm. My shave lasts longer too.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jeers to Schick.</li>
    <li> In the winter months I usually avoid shaving my legs, but it&#x27;s hard to avoid in summer. Shaving is usually a big production for me, as even in summer I only shave when I need to (for wearing a bathing suit etc), and the hair on my legs is quite coarse and long. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Intuition was half-off in my local supermarket, so I decided to give it a try. I doubt I would have bought it in the first place if it had not been on sale, as it is expensive compared to other razors &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros &lt;br /&gt;- For women who don&#x27;t like shaving because of the time and mess, the convenience is great. With the Intutition it&#x27;s easy to do quick touch ups. &lt;br /&gt;- I found the shave just as close as any shave I&#x27;ve ever had using a regular razor and foam. &lt;br /&gt;- I have sensitive skin, but the skin conditioning solid didn&#x27;t give me any problems, and the shave was mostly nick-free. &lt;br /&gt;- Reduces mess in the bathroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons &lt;br /&gt;- Expensive. You won&#x27;t save money despite the fact that you don&#x27;t have to buy shaving foam. In fact you&#x27;ll probably spend more. &lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s difficult to rinse the hairs out of the blade without melting away the skin conditioning solid. Because of this it&#x27;s not a good choice for longer hair. &lt;br /&gt;- The solid melts away long before the blade has become too blunt to use, which adds a lot to the cost. &lt;br /&gt;- Can be hard to see where you&#x27;ve shaved. &lt;br /&gt;- Can be a little awkward to use if you don&#x27;t have a large shower stall. &lt;br /&gt;- Not great for underams/bikini because of the large surface area of the skin conditioning solid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that the cons appear to outweigh the pros, I would recommend the Intutition, but only as a backup to your regular shaving routine. Hanging it in the shower means you can grab it and spend five minutes giving your legs a quick going-over as you need.</li>
    <li> The Schick Intuition shaves well, but the unscented is stinky!    I am sensitive to fragrance, so I was thrilled to see \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; on the package. But soon I realized that the perfume wafting all over my bathroom was coming from my razor. Now I have to keep my razor outside, which is, well, inconvenient.    Scent is not necessary in a razor, folks! Let&#x27;s make it truly unscented!</li>
    <li> love the shaver .only downfall with it would have to be that the soap part of the razor doesn&amp;#34;t last very long. It gives a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s a lot easier to use than what I&#x27;ve been doing before (although I shall say that cheap hair conditioner works a lot better than shaving cream on my legs :)  )   It smells nice, I have never cut myself using this shaver as opposed to regular raizors....I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap razors, like the ones you get at the Dollar Store, for a few years now. I have a hard time plopping down $10 for a razor head. After mutilating my legs with the cheap blades I finally broke down and purchased the Intuition razor. All I can say is, Wow! What a difference a four blades instead of one makes! I&#x27;ve used my Intuition a few times now and can&#x27;t imagine going back to the the cheapies...ever!   As I mentioned before, the Intuition is a spendy little razor so I look out for the razor refills to go on sale. That doesn&#x27;t happen too often in my area, but when it does I am one happy camper &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> i have been shaving for 10 years. i&#x27;ve tried the Venus, the Gillette Daisies, and generic brands. but the Intuition blew them all out of the water. i mean, shaving is not fun especially because i shave my entire arms, but this razor cut my shaving time in half. it cuts CLOSE, glides and moisturizes. i love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, with no razor burn or drag I orginally bought it for traveling so I wouldn&#x27;t have to take shaving cream, but loved it so much I threw out my Venus. I agree that it doesn&#x27;t lather up well after several shaves, but when I&#x27;m at home it can be used with shaving cream or gel like a regular razor and I still get smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Love this razor very smooth, and easy to use. When you go over your skin you almost don&#x27;t even realize you are shaving. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute worst razor I have ever used.  I am a 35 year old woman who has been shaving for over 20 years.  It is usually a rare occasion that I cut myself while shaving.  Since using the Intuition razor, I have mutilated both my ankles and both my knees.  The shape and bulk of this razor does not allow for precision movements around curved areas.  Even on the smooth sections of my legs, the razor catches and skips, and I am stubbly by the end of the day.  And forget about using this razor on armpits or bikini line.  Even if this razor worked well on my legs, I&#x27;d need a different razor for those delicate areas.  I am extremely dissapointed in this product, as are most of my friends who have tried it.  And, yes, I did wet both the razor and my skin, and shaved while in the shower, so that is not the problem.  What a waste of money.  I should have listened to my intition, and left this worthless product on the shelf. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> After years of cutting my legs with dollar-store razors, I finally decided to treat myself to a decent razor. I picked the Intuition because I really liked the idea of having the soap and shaver in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main \\&quot;pro\\&quot; of this razor is that, in my opinion, it gives a good, close shave. I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems with it not shaving closely enough that other reviewers have mentioned; maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it glides along the leg very smoothly. I&#x27;ve nicked myself occasionally at the ankle and knee, though - go carefully in those spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s convenient to be able to hang the razor right in the shower from the suction-cup hook. Since I only shave in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t bother me that both your legs and the razor need to be wet for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons. The soap wears down very quickly. I&#x27;ve even had one soap bar pop off the razor completely after only a couple of uses, and there was no way to reattach it - there went one very expensive refill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, the refills are EXPENSIVE! Way overpriced, if you ask me, especially since they don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the average refill lasts in good condition (with soap on the sharp side of the blades) for maybe 6 uses; after that, the only soap is left on the dull side of the blades, where it doesn&#x27;t do any good (what genius is responsible for that bit of designing??). I usually use the razor anyway until all the soap is gone - maybe a dozen shaves total, only half of which are as they should be. Poor value for the money there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using the Intuition for now; however, when I run out of refills next time I might just go back to a plain ol&#x27; razor and shave gel. This product deserves an honest 2.5 stars - it&#x27;s a great idea that&#x27;s been hamstrung by a poor finished design and overexuberant pricing.</li>
    <li> I like the way this razor shaves but will use shaving cream and a simpler model when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as pictured—same package, color, and cartridge.  Very pleased as I&#x27;m a longtime Intuition user and I&#x27;m glad I could still find one!  Schick has stopped making these, but I dislike the new handles that do not come with a hole at the end for hanging on a shower caddy hook—I&#x27;m sorry, but the plastic thing that comes with the new ones to &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; it up via suction cup on the shower wall is a pathetic excuse for a holder.</li>
