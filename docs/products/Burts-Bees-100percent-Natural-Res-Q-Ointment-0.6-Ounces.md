<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife and I both love this product—it&#x27;s not greasy and it works great! If you work with a lot of papers, this is the item to keep on top of your desk or workplace!</li>
    <li> Continue to use, a box can be used for a long time, but not for a long time the itching, need to wipe again and again.</li>
    <li> Things very good very satisfied, delivery speed is also quickly next time to buy ,i like it very much.next time i will buy again</li>
    <li> Very good! And my friend &amp; her children like it !&lt;br /&gt;Nice price &amp; combo.&lt;br /&gt;Good ! My friends like it very much!</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Think since this company has been purchased by some mega corporation the formulas have changed.&lt;br /&gt;Just not the same Res-Q Ointment.</li>
    <li> I was the first to purchase this product, it is very good. Antipruritic effect and eliminate lumps, my children and I like it !</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good, I think one of their best products. Scratches seem to heal faster with this than with an antibiotic ointment. I do with the size was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years.  One tin lasts a very long time.  Several months ago I bought two replacement tins and, after using it for a while, I found that it was not working as good as it used to.  I did a little research and found that, since the company was bought and has transitioned to a larger \\&quot;corporate\\&quot; type company, they have changed the ingredients of this product.  It now contains soybean and canola oil (I am sure NOT organic since it didn&#x27;t say it) and no longer contains the sweet almond oil.  For anyone who is concerned about the dangers of soy and canola oils, take heed, especially since these are not even organic.  Anyway, it doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore, not sure if this is why, but I am looking for a new product and throwing away my two newest tins of this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I cut my finger pretty bad at Thanksgiving (we had to super glue it closed and almost had to get stitches) but I used this on the wound as it healed and now you can&#x27;t even see a scar. It is great on bug bites, minor scrapes, and even on bruises!! Bought a 3 pack so I could distribute it amongst my friends.</li>
    <li> This stuff is PERFECT for calming down mosquito bites! It immediately stopped the bites from swelling or itching. This isn&#x27;t what I bought it for but I&#x27;m glad I can still put it to use.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff! My dogs groomer put me onto it due to the scratches she gets. Nothing works like it. No stores carry it much anymore :(</li>
    <li> I hate to be the lone dissenting review, but I cannot testify to its healing powers because I had to run and wash it off. I love to cook with rosemary, but I thought the rosemary and comfrey smell of this salve was overwhelming. Sorry Burt&#x27;s Bees... I love most of your products, but this one made me sneeze. It would probably be a good salve for men - it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I felt so bad about giving a Burt&#x27;s Bees product a bad review that I tried putting a tiny bit on a scratch ... still bothered by the smell.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a kid, I get cold sores on my lips pretty often. I get them when I&#x27;m stressed, when I&#x27;m ill, when it&#x27;s cold, when my lips are chapped, basically any time my immune system is compromised and my lips are aggravated. My childhood doctor gave me some prescription lip balm that I continued to use until adulthood and I took Lysine supplements daily. My cold sores always came hard and fast, were large and painful; yeah, just not a very attractive or wonderful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I recently discovered that once I feel a cold sore coming on, I could put on some Res-Q on my lips and it would killed off the cold sore. I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient in the balm accomplishes this, but it does a weird thing where it keeps the wound open and heals it from the inside out. It&#x27;s pretty gross for the first couple days but after a while, my lips turned back to normal and the entire process is a lot easier and cheaper than prescriptions and lysine supplements (bottles of which I would down hourly when I felt a cold sore coming on). One time I lost my Res-Q, had a cold sore come and had to frantically tear apart my apartment to locate it. That&#x27;s how much I rely on it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for lip cold sore sufferers, this is an amazing product and daily usage of it as your lip balm of choice would be great to keep the evil sores away. The only con is it turns your lips kind of green and it might mess up the color of your lipstick or gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have this product in a lip balm form, but it comes with SPF and I&#x27;m not sure how good it is for cold sores. I use the one in the tin.</li>
    <li> I love Res-Q ointment! I put it on everything: bruises, cuts, burns, and recently a canker sore. It always does the job and I feel better knowing it contains natural ingredients. Yesterday I discovered that the ingredient list on my older tin is different than the ingredient list on the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s website. My tin says: Sweet almond oil, olive oil, beeswax, cocoa butter, wheat germ oil, vitamin e, lavender oil, comfrey leaf &amp; root extracts. Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s website says: Olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, beeswax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, triticum vulgare (wheat) germ oil, lavandula hybrida (lavandin) oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, tocopherol, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) flower extract,, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, canola oil, zea mays (corn) oil, symphytum officinale (comfrey) leaf extract, CI 75810 (chlorophyllin-copper complex).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve removed the sweet almond oil and added soybean, canola and corn oil?! And what is chlorophyllin-copper complex? Gross. Guess it&#x27;s time for me to start looking for a new ointment.</li>
    <li> Always write the product satisfies!</li>
    <li> I love this &#x27;green goo&#x27;! I put it on bruises, bug bites, zits, cuts, anything! It speeds up healing time and decreases scarring. I&#x27;m always letting others borrow it and on a recent vacation with friends we were all putting it on our mosquito bites. It really is a miracle green goo.</li>
    <li> low price, good quality, protect me from hateful mosquito</li>
    <li> This little tin is with me always. For me it speeds up healing.  I have thin skin and am constantly bruising from small cuts (gardening) and if I use this immediately on the cut I don&#x27;t bruise at all.  It&#x27;s good for any kind of scrape, cut and acne breakouts.  Literally, promotes healing overnight, if applied soon enough. I have 4-5 in the house all the time and have sent it to my kids.  Amazon&#x27;s price is the cheapest any where for this.</li>
    <li> Is it Pack of 3?I just received one!!!</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get. If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, then I wouldn&#x27;t buy a three pack. But, if you have chapped anything and need COMFREY, which is what this product used to be called, then I would recommend it at the approx 5 each price I got it for. Other than that, there is not much that can go wrong with an ointment order...unless you appoint your ointment to  you grointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend I guess. Unless you can get it cheaper somewhere else. Really not much to say about this one, I don&#x27;t know. It is a pack of 3 Burt&#x27;s Bees Res-Q Ointment, .6-Ounces each!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bough it but my friends told my that it shouldn&#x27;t be used for the baby under 2 year old.</li>
    <li> I like this one. It&#x27;s very useful when you go outside. You will feel much better after you use it. And this is green. I always bring one when I go for trip.</li>
    <li> Great product - love Burts Bee&#x27;s stuff.</li>
    <li> it worked well when there were scraps on my daughter&#x27;s hands. and i boutgh many, and i will recommend it to my friends as well.</li>
    <li> 5 bucks for a small 6 oz can is very pricey but I still order it because it works. My 4 year old girls get bug bites, small paper cuts, bruises, boo boo and the solution is Burt&#x27;s Bee Ointment. Applying the cream every night before tucking them in has become a daily routine. We always carry a couple of them when go on a trip. It will be five stars if the price is reduced to like $3 a pop. Haven&#x27;t found an alternative to Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> Very popular item in China!</li>
    <li> Great product - as someone with sensitive skin that bruises easily, I use it all the time. Bruises go away faster when using it. the smell isn&#x27;t the best (my cats and dogs hate it), but it&#x27;s not repulsive. It just smells herbal. The price for the pack of three is better than any I found in local stores, too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with this product. It heals damaged skin, cut skin, and soothes blemished &amp; irritated skin! Can&#x27;t go wrong with lavender, safflower oil, comfrey, rosemary, wheat germ oil, etc~ all ingredients that help purify and rejuvenate skin. I keep one at home, another in my purse and am saving the 3rd one as a gift. Wonderful product!!! Once I&#x27;m done (don&#x27;t know when that will be since a little goes a long way) will be coming back for more. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Bought the three pack and I keep one in my purse and one in the bathroom, and gave one away as a gift.  I like the herbal smell and it seems to speed healing.  My 2 year old daughter also likes it and it has helped a lot with the many scrapes and bruises she&#x27;s getting from toddler wipe-outs.  It does not sting.  Great product.  For xmas I&#x27;m going to buy one for each of my family members!</li>
    <li> I have used several of Burt&#x27;s Bees products over the years.  They are very good.  However, the Res-Q ointment is awesome.  It truly does rescue your skin.  I use it mainly on my hands.  A little goes a long way.  You will see an instant change in your skin.  I will never be without it!</li>
    <li> bad smell and expensive.will not buy again.Do not recommend to other friends after I try it .........................................will not ....buy again..again..again....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to use it. My baby will be born in June, in preparation for the time. But I believe it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> This is totally a miracle product, helps prevent scaring and just help speed the healing process up, hard to find in stores, I will repurchase this product for the rest of my life!  HIGHLY recommend this! :)</li>
    <li> This is the best product of  Res-Q Ointment. It works well as the Introduction.</li>
    <li> It works really well for the mosquito bit. My sister asked me to buy this for her one-year old son~</li>
    <li> Read that ingredient list.  Read it again.  All natural products and no nasty chemicals.  I bought this interesting little package at the local store because the picture on the tin caught my eye as well as the unusual non-tube package.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last four or five years.  This all natural salve is very effective on those minor cuts and scratches.  It&#x27;s super on those itchy bug bites.  I find that my scrapes and scratches heal faster when I apply this salve to them.  I now got some kind of itchy patch on my leg from something in the yard and my Burt&#x27;s Res Q is doing wonders for it.  As soon as I apply it to my leg, the itching stops!  It&#x27;s truly an amazing product.  It has a gentle, natural smell that I find refreshing; none of that awful chemical smell.  I really love that it NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS, which is cruel and harmful to animals locked in cages.  Without all of that expensive testing, this product is inexpensive.  The lip balm is a winner too.  I don&#x27;t use many health and beauty products, but whenever I have a need to shop in that Aisle, I&#x27;m looking for Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> This stuff heals cuts, bruises...it doesn&#x27;t sting and has a pleasant smell. Children never run away screaming. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> i bought this pack for my nephew,and my cousin loves using this for her baby,especially during the summer time . GREAT!</li>
    <li> I use this for all kinds of cuts and scrapes as an alternative to antibacterial ointment. I&#x27;ve also used it to rub my babies&#x27; chests after their nigh-time bath when they have a bad cold instead of vicks and it works great and smells better than vicks.</li>
    <li> I am big fan of all of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. Res-Q is great for burns, cuts, I shaved too close….you name it because it is natural I even use it on my pets too. Not sure if that is kosher but works great. I keep it in my purse and bathrooms. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff works on stings and bites. Everyone asks for it once they have a boo boo. Stops insect sting within a minute. Also soothes mosquito bites. The kids apply it their selves. Doesn&#x27;t burn so they let you apply it. I keep it on my subscribe and save for every 3 months.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Products because of their high quality.  My grandbaby has extremely sensitive skin.  She had two very chapped areas on her face where her pacifier edges rubbed. The skin was reddened, hard and irritated.  I applied a thin layer of Res-Q ointment and within the hour the area looked considerably better. A couple hours later it was hardly noticable!! Now it has become a standard item in her diaper bag.</li>
    <li> It works great always and shared to friends and applied to nieces and nephews and kids.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful to have in summer ready</li>
    <li> The recommendation of a friend of a product, not yet started, said the result was very good, pure natural extracts, very suitable for children to use, is in the summer, the mosquito bite occurs from time to time, to prepare their children to, hope can like expected that plays obvious effect</li>
    <li> I am very allergic to mosquito bites and they like to bite me.  My bites swell up, are terribly itchy, and last for a week. However, a friend let me use a bit of this balm earlier this afternoon and my bug bite hasn&#x27;t been itchy since. In fact, I completely forgot that I had one! It&#x27;s still puffy, but definitely not itchy. AMAZING and I am sold. It works better than the cortizone cream.</li>
    <li> The very best in natural ointments, unless you make your own!</li>
    <li> Good goods, satisfaction</li>
    <li> I ordered pack of 3, and they sent me only 2.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have time to return and get back because I am planning to give them to someone as a gift.</li>
    <li> I searched many stores - target/walmart,  it&#x27;s hard to find it. Amazon is the right place to buy this for my kid, and the price is good too.</li>
    <li> Good enough,My son like it</li>
    <li> this is a gift for my friend and its worth it</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products. Extremely effective at soothing bug bites and healing cuts.</li>
    <li> pack 3,only received 1</li>
    <li> I really like it, my friends really like it too, You should get it. when you travel, you should take it</li>
    <li> I use this ointment as moisturizer for my healed tattoos! It really makes the color \\&quot;pop\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> This has really helped with the eczema I have on my fingers. Stops the itch and helps heal the remaining dry patches. Seems to prevent flair-ups too. Always in my purse or pocket.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what date but I would say within the last year they drastically changed the ingredients to this product, it does not feel or seem to work the same, and it actually doesn&#x27;t last as long. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it now.</li>
    <li> I love Res-Q-Ointment, it&#x27;s so soothing...bites, scrapes, minor burns!  It really seems to speed up the healing time.  I was so disappointed when I ran out and went to buy more.  Couldn&#x27;t find it at any store.  Luckily, I thought to check good &#x27;ol Amazon and there it was!  I ordered the three pack!  Just love it!  (Try it as a cuticle cream, works better that anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried!)</li>
    <li> it works so amazingly. at the very beginning of you finging baby stinged ,gently use it and keep baby quiet.</li>
    <li> I work in a hospital and wash my hands often.  This leads to my skin cracking along the edges of my finger nails.  This product helps heal and protect my hands.  I have recommended this product to many of my co-workers and they love this product as much as I do.l</li>
    <li> This product is really working well for my family. We can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  It only ranks a 1 on the EWG scale of safety which I love!  I had been using it long before I started caring about what chemicals were being used in my products though.  It works wonders for chapped lips and chapped nostrils during the winter.  I have also used it on small cuts or burns (after the burn has started to heal not directly after).  It smells a lot like rosemary and lavender although not the commercial versions the honest to goodness herbal scent from the plants.  I happen to like the smell and so does my husband but if you do not like the scent then you may want to look for something else.</li>
    <li> I used them for my son.&lt;br /&gt;My son was 6 months old when I used it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;It was helping a lot to keep the mosquitos away from the baby.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and texture, but as far as using it goes, it goes on cuts JUST for moisture. It didn&#x27;t help heal anything quickly or at all really. I do like to use it on my gauged ears though. It works better than cocoa butter...cocoa butter makes my plugs slip out</li>
    <li> I have bought this product at Watsons stores in Hong Kong, this time in the Amazon I bought the same product (the third party), but the store&#x27;s product comparison, found comfrey cream smells very light, effect not very good, I&#x27;m really disappointed. Have you ever seen&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees 100% Natural Res-Q Ointment production batch is B014212J this file?</li>
    <li> I originally started using Res-Q Ointment as tattoo aftercare - it&#x27;s excellent for that, the best product I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve got a lot of ink). It&#x27;s also amazing for dry/cracked skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and the scent is a light smell of olive oil.</li>
    <li> This product can be put on any type of itch, sore, or burn.  It really does heal it!  Honest! I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> I love this for bug bites and stings as well as minor cuts and scrapes.</li>
    <li> I used to love Burt&#x27;s Bees products until I found out that after they get product from Queens, they kill them.  I have a soft spot for bees and this seems cruel and unnecessary.</li>
    <li> This is very satisfied</li>
    <li> I think Burt&#x27;s Bees products are absolutely the best, we use them for rashes, burns, cuts and dry hands and feet, so far, we have never found another product that can do so many different things.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees Res-Q-Ointment is a little smelly, kind of like camphor, but after awhile you get used to the smell and knowing that your problem area is going to get well very soon, it is so very much worth it!</li>
    <li> Love the product, but I ordered the 3-pack, and recieved a single tub.</li>
    <li> Great product, is good for insect bites.</li>
    <li> i like this brand ，it&#x27;s very good and beautyful，so i choose this brand 。but i wish this can more discount and cheap。</li>
    <li> We have a lot of mosquitoes around our house. My girl had a lot of mosquito bites and she did not like to put stuff on it. However she can tolerate this Burt&#x27;s Bees Res-Q Qintment and it really makes her more comfortable with the bite. My wife loves it also.</li>
    <li> it is the FAKE products</li>
    <li> I bought it as a holiday gift to my friend&#x27;s children. it is a great gift, for the sake of health</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why Burt&#x27;sbees green ointment was always out of stock I the local store.&lt;br /&gt;So I searched it in Amazon and found it finally with good price too.&lt;br /&gt;This ointment is so famous among many parents and works so effectively and directly.&lt;br /&gt;It is also handy..&lt;br /&gt;It is a must buy item if you have children!</li>
    <li> They are very good! My friends and I love them very much!  I am sure I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love this &#x27;green goo&#x27;! I put it on bruises, bug bites, zits, cuts, anything! It speeds up healing time and decreases scarring. I&#x27;m always letting others borrow it and on a recent vacation with friends we were all putting it on our mosquito bites. It really is a miracle green goo.</li>
    <li> So effective for bugs bites. It gives you a cool and calm feelings after you apply it. Generally, I will repurchase it</li>
    <li> Res-Q ointment is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for minor (yes, even blistering) burns.  Use cold water immediately for a while, like 30-45 minutes, then apply ointment and cover lightly to keep air from burn.  The pain stops very quickly and I&#x27;ve found the ointment does hasten healing.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> it is good,i like it&lt;br /&gt;The brands and styles, the high cost&lt;br /&gt;When needed to buy&lt;br /&gt;Also good to give as gifts</li>
    <li> Is it true that comfrey is actually harmful to liver and should not be used on children?</li>
    <li> if you get mosquito bites, rashes, cuts, hangnails, bumps, ect-this product is for you.  I find something just about everyday to use this on!!!  Most effective on mosquito bites, when I am scratching like crazy I dab just a little on the bite and I don&#x27;t feel the itching for several hours!!!</li>
    <li> Very good, very like, the next opportunity will come to buy! Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Very good, very like, the next opportunity will come to buy! Thank you.</li>
    <li> It is a must have for everyone, it is good for almost everything and smells great! My mom loves this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve put an awful lot of stuff on my son&#x27;s skin, between his being four to his current eight-years old, to alleviate itching.  This is the only item that has reliably addressed whatever caused the problem and thus is the one salve that my son always requests (there was a multi-month period that I had run out of Burts that I don&#x27;t plan to repeat.)  Get it, use it, don&#x27;t run out of it.</li>
    <li> This product has been in use, the effect is very good. Do not know if there is no harm to the baby. The recent rumors, the commodity to have harm to the child, I do not know is true or false</li>
    <li> maybe it&#x27;s good, i have not try it. because now it&#x27;s winner, i will it&#x27;s more useful in summer, do you think so</li>
    <li> Purchased once a year at least.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t praise this product enough.  I think I originally bought it for cuticles and because I loved the ingredients.  Well, this works for ANYTHING! I&#x27;ve used it on scrapes and cuts, bug bites and dry skin.  I&#x27;ve used it on my kids and my dog!  A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s so small and portable that it can be kept almost anywhere.</li>
    <li> This is the best product , I use it on everything and i mean everything, Ive been using it for about 7 years and it has saved me many times from oil burn to mosquito bites I even put it on my moms shingles. so if your looking for a alternative to neosporin type products BURT&#x27;S BEES RES-Q-OINTMENT is the answer!!!</li>
    <li> This Doctor Burt&#x27;s Res-Q Ointment is compact and multi-purpose, making it great for travel! &#x27;Soothes bug bites, mystery rashes, irritation, etc. I use it both at home and when I&#x27;m abroad. Really handy.</li>
    <li> Comfrey ointment has good effect, mosquito bites after Po baby soon spread quickly, does not itch</li>
    <li> received at deadline,but still nice</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  WISH IT WAS EASIER TO FIND.</li>
    <li> Best ointment ever had</li>
    <li> good and fast  on time</li>
    <li> This is good on cold sores as well as bee stings or anything else you need an&lt;br /&gt;ointment for.  Stops cold sores in their tracks.</li>
    <li> I failed to notice it has lavender in it. I am analytically allergic to lavender after being overexposed to it as a nurse. Why must companies over saturate the market with such a strong smelling extract? Which I could return it but I cannot risk hauling it in my car to the post office. To the garbage it goes.</li>
    <li> I rarely had the problem of red, rough patches on my hands before experiencing this harsh NE winter. I had rashes on my hands for weeks that did not go away with any moisturizer or barrier I tried. Some of them burned my patches, even very expensive brands of hand creams. Found Res-Q ointment that I had picked up in an airport kiosk in the garage; had bought it because my skin is so sensitive, and it was labeled &amp;#34;100% natural.&amp;#34; Could not believe that my painful skin patches healed after just two days of using this at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a bit of a strong smell, suppose from the comfrey, but if that&#x27;s what makes it heal, it&#x27;s well worth living with. Leaving this review as I am buying more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite good! One day, bug bites my leg, then make me feel so itchy. After I applied some of this product on my skin with finger tip, it works immediately! No itchy any more!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Res-Q (tin pack), we have discovered, is great for relieving itching from mosquito bites and rashes (my friend is using it to relieve itching caused by something she ate that she is allergic to).  it also works on mild, small burn areas, like when you accidentally burn your finger on the interior oven door.  In the tin container, the ointment works best as a \\&quot;spot\\&quot; minder, not easily spreadable for large-spread areas of bites or rashes (perhaps buy it in another type of container to spread on larger areas).  But the little round tin container of res-q is great for those isolated itchy spots on your fingers, arms, ankles, etc. And it&#x27;s natural, not toxic.  Also, healing is quick--I used it on a minor burn, and the blister was gone the next day, no kidding....</li>
    <li> I buy this quite often and we use it for all insect bites, which heal up surprisingly fast, as well as other injuries.</li>
    <li> I am an international student, and this is something I will buy every time when I go back to my country.</li>
    <li> product as describe, very efficiently for treatment of all sorts of skin discomfort&lt;br /&gt;Love it now in my pocket all the time</li>
    <li> Although the stock is not good, but the refund is solved..</li>
    <li> This ointment is not itching. but it can premote wound healing.This summer ,I have a lot of wounds by mosquito biting. This wounds itch.  I eat  antipruritics and paint this ointment. About 7days,  the wound is healed. If  I do  not paint  it  ,the  wound  is not itch,but it can  not be  healed  so  soon. so I need this  ointment. I  like  it , I  like  its  smell  too .</li>
    <li> My kids call it the Magic Green Medicine. This stuff works wonders. It works great to take the pain out of insect stings and it stops the itch.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely good for your children when they are getting bite by mosquito or other bugs. great medical care. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I use this product a lot!  I am always scraping myself or cutting myself and using it.  I also use it for my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash and it works better than anything I have ever used.  I have one in the bathroom and one in the diaper bag.  Great product, best price and value here on Amazon.  I have shopped around quite a bit for this product!</li>
    <li> This is for a relative. I think she likes it.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s recommendation is very good, very good product, I very like to use it, it brings me a very good enjoyment</li>
    <li> i need it .because useful.Want a discount.i will buy it once more.i love my baby and happy birthday for you!</li>
    <li> Great item when you are on camping or something.</li>
    <li> Very good and my baby likes it</li>
    <li> A few days ago，When I was cooking，the water vapor  burnt my finger,when i used it for a little while,it is no exaggeration to say that ， I didn&#x27;t hurt at all。</li>
    <li> Great ointment to apply on skin after mosquito bites. Top quality!</li>
    <li> Using this instead of the Burt&#x27;s Bees itch relief, which I cannot seem to find.</li>
    <li> thanks, and the product is great for bug bites...</li>
    <li> BURT&#x27;S BEES IS ALL-POWERFUL .USE RANGE IS VERY WIDE.&lt;br /&gt;INSECT BITES,CLOOISION,ECZEMA AND SO ON.&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRICE IS REASONABLE.AND GREAT EFFECTIVE.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Helps take the sting out of these crazy mosquito bites. Will def recommend others to purchase this salve!</li>
    <li> I use this ointment to alleviate itching from several skin conditions, including a scarring inflammatory disease and it works well. I alternate it with prescription creams.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how this oinment speeds the healing of small cuts and abrasions. It also have been very beneficial for long term skin problems for which other creams and ointments had very little impact.</li>
    <li> The carton was damaged upon arrival however the products are intact.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a pack of three. We love the oilment except the smell is horrible..... The smell stay on my cloth for quite sometimes even after laundry. Other than the smell the product is ok.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction around my eyes- dry, itchy, flaky skin on top and bottom lids- it was awful- haven&#x27;t been able to wear makeup for weeks. You can&#x27;t use cortizone on your eyelids, and NOTHING I tried worked. I started using Burts Res-q , and could not believe how quickly the healing began. I&#x27;m sending my daughter a 3-pack for her 1 year old, who has eczema on his leg. You can hardly find this in the stores. Thank you BURTS!</li>
    <li> Send to friends. Feel good</li>
    <li> love this stuff...helps heal much faster.</li>
    <li> The good effect of drugs&lt;br /&gt;I grazed in the evening, local swelling the next morning when he disappeared&lt;br /&gt;Really amazing</li>
    <li> These products are the price is cheap,&lt;br /&gt;Now I like this product.</li>
    <li> Given as stocking stuffers this year, this is a must have for children and adults when mosquitoes R around!</li>
    <li> I love this ointment for bruises &amp; scars. It is good.</li>
    <li> Used this for itch from insect bites. Work perfectly!</li>
    <li> The picture shows that the product is 17 grams, but it is actually only 15 grams...&lt;br /&gt;i do not think it is great&lt;br /&gt;so&#x27;please change your picture</li>
    <li> Everyone loves Burt&#x27;s Bees. The seller is just as good as this product. It provides considerate service.</li>
    <li> I was bitten terribly when I travelled in the southern part, it did help me a lot, already recommended to my friends</li>
    <li> I was going to buy some more of the Burts Rescue for my wife for Christmas when I read that the ingredients had changed. After looking at my old tin and reading the new ingredient list I realized several key ingredients had been removed and exchanged for very questionable ingredients. The comp. was bought out by Clorox in 2007 and neither of the 2 founders is any longer with the company. I will not buy these products anymore. Very sad.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores so I ordered it. The bottom tin color was a bit different and made me wonder it&#x27;ll it was the real deal but it seems to be the exact product. Love this stuff. Kids will ask me for it and guests remember I have it and ask for it too. Great product</li>
    <li> very good, cheaper than other place, and may friend likes it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic ointment for mosquito bites. I live in New York and lately it seems like as soon as I leave the house, all kinds of nasty bugs (usually the ones that leave giant ugly bumps on your skin) attack me as though they have a personal vendetta against me... who knows I may have killed some of their aunts and uncles in my earlier war days..  What ever the case those damn bites appear all over my ankle and those of my son as well (they&#x27;re mean those bastards going after my descendants!) This little miracle ointment keeps the itching controlled to a (not rip my skin off) level and actually soothes the itch and burn.  It also seems to shrink the ugly bumps. So I don&#x27;t look like a tribal freak looking to \\&quot;fashion\\&quot; bumps around my ankles.  Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely get this, better yet get a few!  Though I don&#x27;t use much. I have a feeling i will always want it on hand.  I&#x27;d get one for the diaper/regular person without little monsters you call your kids bag.</li>
    <li> This ointment is very effective for treating mosquitos bites (Anti-itch cream or Afterbite does not work for me).  After I get bitten, I try to immediately clean the bite site w/ alcohol wipe &amp; then apply this ointment generously - this will stop the itching in less than 5 minutes &amp; even prevent a welt from forming or lessen the welt &amp; usually re-application is not necessary.  But the longer I wait to apply this, the less effective it is &amp; then repeat applications will be required for sure.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is always good! Helps for those little bug bites from camp outs and is just a good moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years just in the winter when I get deep cracks in my hands and feet. Works wonders. The rest of the year I use the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees hand salve.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love this. So much so that they haven&#x27;t let me get one from the pack. Handles all their little sores and bites.</li>
    <li> Works great on mosquito bites.  Instant relief.</li>
    <li> my gf said that is useful</li>
    <li> good with strong smell</li>
    <li> The best stuff ever for any skin irritations or injuries. Helps prevent scarring. Stops bug bites from itching. Heals cuts and scrapes better than any other ointment. Even use it on our pets because it is all natural. Gave some to a friend who was experiencing a part of an incision that would not heal, even with the use of expensive prescription ointments, and it worked on that.  In this day of too much antibiotic exposure, great stuff to have around. Toss the neosporin!</li>
    <li> Give the child has been using this, all natural more assured.</li>
    <li> bought it for my sister in law, and kept one my self. it really help to cool the skin down when there was a scratch.</li>
    <li> very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very goodI love this powder!! I agree it smells heavenly, a subtle floral without being overbearing. Baby Bee (I love the name, it&#x27;s so cute) goes with any fragrance I want to wear or is just delightful all by itself. It&#x27;s nicely absorbant and because it doesn&#x27;t have talc it doesn&#x27;t get all over your clothes. I use it all day when I want to feel a little lift because it just smells so good. It&#x27;s nice to use at bedtime, too. Although I don&#x27;t have a baby, I can&#x27;t imagine a nicer powder to use on a little one. I think a basket of Baby Bee things would be the loveliest baby shower gift. I also like that it comes in a shaker container so I can take it with me as well as put it in a powder jar. The best puff to use is the big fluffy lambswool puff made by Caswell Massey that I got on Amazon.</li>
    <li> 11 dao for 3,too many fake in taobao .! i will buy this stuff when it on discount again a</li>
    <li> Awesome Product. Highly recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good item.fast shipping,delivery on time.I like it .I will recomand the item to my relative .</li>
    <li> works really well. so far the best product we have tired.</li>
    <li> I never travel with out this stuff. Great for cuts, bug bites and dry skin and you just cant find it over here!</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and I really love this product. It smells great and I put it on any skin irritation. I love the smell and I keep one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom, and one in my purse. This is a more natural product with great qualities and results.</li>
    <li> Bought a lot of times. Summer, it is really very good. Always buy many gifts for friends, they all said very good.</li>
    <li> Little Bee products have seen in infants and pregnant forum has been, and always wanted to try this take along a give it a try</li>
    <li> I bought them for my friends, they all like it. It works well as it describe. It good for cure mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> Not yet used.The taste is fragrant.</li>
    <li> I have used it before. it&#x27;s really a good product for baby. so I buy some this time and the baby will like it.</li>
    <li> I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Rescue Ointment on everything from zits and razor burn to sun burns and poison ivy and it is incredible. Must have for anyone. Does not affect my sensitive skin. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I love Res-Q Oinment because of their high quality.  3 month ago, I bought this as soon as I heard it was wonderful/miracle balm that treats bruises, scrapes, burns, cuts, chapped skin, etc...  Wow! It was good. I bought more products becuase I will give to my sister and mom. I love Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
    <li> Really works. Good smelling.</li>
    <li> Use this almost daily fer bug bites..after wife and i play in the woods/garden up here in the mountains !!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees  is good. I like it but I have not used it yet,I hope my baby will like it too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works wonderfully! Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
    <li> I work in a kitchen and am a chemistry major, so burns from hot pans and glass are pretty common. I use this within 12 or so hours of the burn. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help with the pain, in fact in one case, it made it worse for about four minutes. But after heavily coating the burn with Burt&#x27;s Res-Q Ointment and a bandaid for about a day, the skin is obviously dead but absolutely no blister forms. No more pain, sensitivity or open wounds after a popped blister. This is a life saver for me. I&#x27;ve had the same .6 oz tub for about seven months and just bought one for my family, coworkers and chemistry lab first aid kit.</li>
    <li> Best all around ointment to keep around for baby. In fact I&#x27;ve used it on all the nieces for one reason or another.</li>
    <li> It is very good. My child likes it very much. It smell mint and light lavender. I like it so</li>
    <li> very good, already use it.</li>
    <li> Use this for everything related to the skin. Burns, insect bites, scrapes, pimples, chaffed skin &amp; lips - works unbelievably well!  It even works on bruises.  The tin lasts a long time even if you use it everyday, like I do.  This is the one product I have on hand at all times &amp; recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> This is really great stuff. I was told burts bees is possibly discontinuing this item, so i bought a buch if it. It works really great on skin irritation due to allergies or whatever. I recently had a minor burn on my palm while bbqing, and used some of this ointment. After about 5 minutes, i forgot that i was burned! And i had a pretty good blister. I have never personally found anything that gave me that kind of relief. Especially on a burn.</li>
    <li> This is a MUST HAVE item!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered them at the end of last spring semester for my aunt. Now it is end of the world, I will not expect to receive them any more.</li>

    <li> very useful to keep the baby from mosquito, and can be used in the skin which has been bite by mosquito.</li>
    <li> This gadget for mosquito bites treatment effect is very good， I will put this product to recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> This stuff is PERFECT for calming down mosquito bites! I have used several of Burt&#x27;s Bees products over the years.</li>
    <li> It happened once that when I was cleaning the bottles and accidentally hurt my fingers with hot water! I quickly spread this one the fingers and it really reduced the pain! Now I am ordering more for my family!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  One little container will last a long time. Some complain about the smell, I actually like it.</li>
    <li> it is for my friend&#x27;s baby ,they said that it is fit for their baby,they will buy more and more.</li>
    <li> yes,it&#x27;s good for me ,wish to have a discount for me on my next purchase, very nice, i like it</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Products, so no surprise here. My granddaughters love it for their &amp;#34;owies&amp;#34;.  Great buy and good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like a secret magic salve.  I swear it&#x27;s speeding up healing, but can&#x27;t be sure about that.  I can however say that it helps with cracks near my fingernails.  I prefer this product to all the others I&#x27;ve tried for the same (possibly with the exception of Zim&#x27;s crack cream or spray- however it&#x27;s quite difficult to use the spray).  It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Shot down when stock is displayed, but after ten days when I was told when I asked out, wait too long</li>
    <li> I have been using res q ointment for 10 years. Just have trouble finding it. It works great.</li>
    <li> I have the type of skin that responds best to natural products!!!!  I am also a heart patient that uses blood thinners and this ointment completely removes the dark spots from my skin whenever I am bruised!!!  Finally something that works!!!!!!  Thanks Burt!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is so good.&lt;br /&gt;Talked to a gift to share with your friends product was so good. Is satisfied.</li>
    <li> A half of hour is good.</li>
    <li> My family always like this product, nature and relief.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good for almost everything</li>
    <li> its safe for the children.when the bugs bite the child,this can relief the symptom in time.I will buy it every summer.</li>
    <li> Great product for any skin issues</li>
    <li> This is the greatest stuff - really works.</li>
    <li> For my mother.She loved it</li>
    <li> Effective to the mosquito bites&lt;br /&gt;Adult and children are available。&lt;br /&gt;Does not apply to children under age 2。</li>
    <li> This product is very good, genuine goods at a fair price, use rise very comfortable, especially suitable for pregnant women, but also itching, with a good effect. Worth having.</li>
    <li> I use this for removing the itch out of mosquito bites. I travel in the developing world and get bitten all the time, this works right away. Love the fact that it&#x27;s compact, non-liquid, and fairly subtle-looking (slightly greenish hue as it absorbs in the skin, but that&#x27;s fine) - much more subtle than calamine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. This is a wonderful/miracle balm that treats bruises, scrapes, burns, cuts, chapped skin, etc... I recommend this to my friends and bought this for family members</li>
    <li> Best price here.  I use them for cuts,burns,and invents bites.  Work very good among my 4kids.  Best on bump! If your kids bumped on head applied it immediately, they will stop crying very soon and the bump disappear in 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> good !very good !ilove it</li>
    <li> Very effective with the mosquito bites!</li>
    <li> I love all of Burt&#x27;s products. I keep one on every floor.</li>
    <li> Somewhere I read that this product was helpful in reducing nose bleeds&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve messed up way too many handkerchiefs.&lt;br /&gt;Now, The first time I tried it it was very effective.&lt;br /&gt;But later I could tell there was a change in the formula and it isn&#x27;t quite as effective.&lt;br /&gt;I found out that they had started using canola oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;Which really surprised me in that canola oil is not a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s highly engineered and should not be used in something that calls itself 100% Natural.</li>
    <li> Clears dry scaling skin with immediate results and works better than vaseline especially for that annoying eyelids if you accidently spill some acne product onto it whilst applying it.</li>
    <li> I was given this by a friend who raved about it. I kept it for almost 6 months without using it because I didn&#x27;t think I needed another cream. Once I finally used it, I now think it is wonderful also. I now use it daily. Heals really dry cuticles, helps cuts heal faster, works great for diaper rash, any kind of cuts or scrapes, bug bites, and a great product for the lips. I also use it on a sun damaged spot on my face and it absorbs beautifully and never breaks me out. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product, perfect shopping</li>
    <li> I wrote this review only because I  received 1 item, not 3 tins of products as I was told, and I wrote letters to the customer service ,but received nothing.So, am I satisfied with this product ?hmm, it is an interesting question.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it! I bought those more!</li>
    <li> I just bought some Res-Q for my 6-month old nephew because everyone says it is good for children. Unfortunately, I found some posts later saying that comfrey is actually harmful to liver and should not be used on children. Since I&#x27;m not a medical major, I did my research on wiki ([...]) and it directed me to University of Maryland Medical Center website ([...] Here is what they said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pediatric&lt;br /&gt;Never give a child comfrey by mouth. Do not apply creams or ointments containing comfrey to a child&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adult&lt;br /&gt;Never take comfrey by mouth. Severe liver poisoning and even death may occur.&lt;br /&gt;When using herb and leaf ointments, creams, and other topical preparations, it&#x27;s important to follow these safety recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;Never apply comfrey to broken skin.&lt;br /&gt;Use only small amounts of comfrey-containing creams for no longer than 10 days at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Do not use any comfrey product for more than 4 - 6 total weeks in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the product so I can say nothing about its effect, but I feel it&#x27;s necessary to share my \\&quot;findings\\&quot;. It&#x27;s better to be more careful on comfrey products.</li>
    <li> Okay, the smell is less than wonderful, but it&#x27;s not that bad, either. The Res-Q ointment is REALLY good. It works better than Neosporin. Put it on a cut or a burn and the next day you will see a significant improvement. I&#x27;ve used it on cat scratches and burns from sliding into 3rd base and everything in between and it works really well on all of it. This is a must have in my household!</li>
    <li> So I got onto the burts bees wagon because of their great lip balm (in the tin of course)&lt;br /&gt;And one day the packaging of this caught my eye, and since it was also in a slightly larger tin, I thought &amp;#34;this looks cool, what is it?&amp;#34; so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;For awhile I forgot I had it around the house, until one day, I had a small cut that was healing and I saw it lying around, I applied it to the cut and the next day the cut felt instantly better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying the cut disappeared, but it did give help the process along and the area definitely felt better and not as sore.&lt;br /&gt;Just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke, the next time I had another paper cut, I applied it immediately, and the next day I almost forgot I even had a cut.&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does, and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural, makes me a lot more comfortable applying it to wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read another review saying the formula changed over the last year or so and doesn&#x27;t work as well, I bought my tin almost 2 years ago, and the ingredients include glycine soja (soybean) oil and canola oil, it still works fine for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now whenever minor cuts or bruises occur. However, I had never tried it on a burn until last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was frying chicken in a pan and one of the breasts slipped out from the grip of my tongs, splashing hot butter/oil across my right arm. I ran the area under cold water but the feel of fire returned almost immediately after removing it. I remembered this little tin and slathered my burns in a thin coat, and a significant amount of the pain receded in seconds. The burns look much better (smaller and no pain unless touched) after waking up the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small tip: Plastic wrap is about as close to sterile as you&#x27;ll get, so if you have a burn you can wrap the effected area after applying Res-Q ointment to keep it in place.</li>
    <li> It is my first time to use it ,it smells very nice,and ,the package is good.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  I used it on the scars from knee replacement.  They look so good the physical therapists are now recommending it.  Also really good on mosquito bites</li>
    <li> Too bad，No effect ah, OMG, mosquito bites, the use of this product or itchy after 3H&lt;br /&gt;But taste good, no irritating odor, very gentle, very good</li>
    <li> it is good. and have a light perfume. it &#x27;s useful sometimes.  the packing is goods.  it is popular in my office</li>
    <li> This thing is reasonably priced and shipped fast after i ordered. Love amazon! The ointment is of fine texture and so far so good. My baby loves it and i can see that it soothes his skin.</li>
    <li> Great ointment. Chapped hands benefit from this. Out here we need it. Me and and all the boys need it!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my mother. She raves about the stuff. I guess I should have kept one for myself!</li>
    <li> Nice product and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of my favorate.&lt;br /&gt;Very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;very clean.&lt;br /&gt;good for health</li>
    <li> I have a pretty serious and chronic skin condition.  This ointment is better at healing the skin than pretty much anything that I tried.  It is great in conjunction with a steroid ointment for the inflammation control.  This is the go-to ointment for me when I have cracks on my hands.</li>
    <li> This has really helped</li>
    <li> I love this Burt&#x27;s Bees rescue ointment. I live in Arizona where there is NO WATER in the air. Our average annual rainfall is 7 inches. Ouch. Everything MUST be moisturized all the time. No matter how careful you are, your skin becomes leather as you age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, TaDUH!!!! Burts RESCUE to save the day. I use this stuff on my hands because they get so dry. I am a nurse and am constantly washing them. At night, they get the Ointment treatment. While I have it handy, I do my cuticles, my elbows, knees and feet and generally my give my face a dab although it generally has some super muscle HIGH COST stuff already on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at the pharmacy one day when a contractor walked in. His hands were a mess. They were white and chalky colored and he had splits in the skin on his fingers and thumbs from not using any type of moisturizer. I gently led him to the Burt&#x27;s Bees Display and handed him some ResQ Ointment along with a few other of Burts products. I told him I did not know how much he had to spend, but if he could only get one thing, the ResQ was the thing to get. He was a bit surprised as I was not an employee of the store, but he took the ointment and the other things and off he went. True loyalty here...selling for Burt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff. Good For you, horses hooves, and what ever else is dry dry dry. It works like a charm. Buy lots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> We use this from summer to autumn.</li>
    <li> It really worked and smells not very bad. I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought it from China. Good items</li>
    <li> 3rd time purchase for my cousin&#x27;s young son. It&#x27;s said to work its magic for small insect bites and small scratches/bumps on the little boy. My cousin loves it. Would recommend for other family members and friends.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for bug bites.  My LO used to get huge bumps from mosquito bites that wouldn&#x27;t go away for weeks.  If we apply the ointment, the bumps are significantly smaller the next day and subsequently lasts only about 1-2 days.  Of course, YMMV....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very thin, not too sticky and has a minty flavor that&#x27;s not over powering such as menthol ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product from burt&#x27;s bees!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff on all kinds of rashes.</li>
    <li> I had 30 skin tags removed from my neck recently. They were burned off by a Dr.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up getting the worse Staph infection and Dermatitis Infection the Dr has ever seen. I was given at RX for the Staph and an antibiotic for the infections that could occur. Nothing was working, then I read online about the Burt’s Bee Res-Q Ointment and decided to order this as a last hope.&lt;br /&gt;Well I wish I could post pictures because I am here to say that it is a MIRACLE.&lt;br /&gt;It worked and healed all my burns within 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I purchased this product. I am a firm believer that had I not taken matters in my own hands that I would have had scares and an escalated infection.&lt;br /&gt;Take it from me it works!! I purchased the 3 pack so I could have a good supply.</li>
    <li> This ointment is super for scrapes, burns, and skin irritations like eczema.</li>
    <li> It is a perfect goods Let me feel happy is good quality and price is the reason why I always choose amazon</li>
    <li> I use to suffer w bad eczema on my legs when I was in my teens... I would scratch in my sleep until my legs bled,... every so often I do that now in my 30s and this ointment has been an IMMESDIATE relief for me... not only does it get me to stop scratching but it also conditions and soothes my scratches and cracked skin.... the next day its like I never scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it would be nice if they made this ointment into a lotion or cream</li>
    <li> I bought it for my friend. Somebody introduce this product to her. It is in good price and high quality.</li>
    <li> Great, good for babies and adults,</li>
    <li> this Ointment is absolutely great! it&#x27;s the best thing for bruise, it helps go away really quick, so you won&#x27;t have people constantly ask what&#x27;s going on for your two years old active boy. I would recommend to every mom carry one of this, it also great for insect bites but not as good as on bruise. For kids who are very active, they are very easy to get bruise, even good on adults like me sometimes bump into chairs or something else. Fast shipping and good price (I got it 3 for 13.77), amazon price fluctuate, I wait for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;2/14/2013&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a little difference between the old one and new one. The old one has Sweet almond oil and other ingredients, it&#x27;s 95.7% natural; The new one doesn&#x27;t have sweet almond oil, and add soybean oil, canola oil, corn oil, rosemary  leaf extract, sunflower oil, and 100% natural. not sure the change make it&#x27;s better or not, to be honest I like the old one&#x27;s smell. The rosemary makes the smell different than the old one, the new one smell more like medicine now.&lt;br /&gt; The packaging is little different, the new one has silver edge. Funny thing is they both are 0.60 OZ, but the old labeled 17g, and new one is 15g? Even though, the small tin will last forever, I bought 3 is because I give it to friends as gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the new one&#x27;s effect once I start to use it. Not that I&#x27;m looking forward to use it, I&#x27;m glad my boy is safe since I bought the new one.</li>
    <li> I always bring the Burt&#x27;s Bees Res-Q ointment with me, I can use it either as a minor pain relieve or lip balm. It&#x27;s very gentle and I can even apply it around my eyes and won&#x27;t get any irritation.</li>
    <li> A good and famouse product,good hand feel,but not effective like my thought,It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;green  &amp;#34; product at all.a good choice.</li>
    <li> This is good for anyone!!&lt;br /&gt;especially for baby and bugs bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT It smells some strong and can color your clothes.</li>
    <li> my family and friends use it for moisquitoes bites,  or any itchy spots on our body ... was told this product safe for young child 2 yrs old and abov ... it is always in my bag , 24x7 with me now :)</li>
    <li> Home for the little guy with the later, skin inflammation disappear very quickly, the surface has no trace, no special flavor, can only hope to always adhere to the use of natural raw materials, not by other companies to assimilation, continue to support their products</li>
    <li> this is the fourth time i bought this item.it works well both on mine and my kid&#x27;s skin during the summer time.</li>
    <li> This product is an all-around ointment for scrapes, cuts, burns, rough skin, you name it!&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly, evaporates, leaving no residue, just smooth, healed skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t run out of this. I really couldn&#x27;t! I put one in each bag - mine, Hubby&#x27;s, daughter&#x27;s and son&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve always thought of this as a big hoax &#x27;til I experienced its &amp;#34;wonders&amp;#34; first hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister-in-law exaggeratigly repeats &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees! Burt&#x27;s Bees!&amp;#34; each and everytime someone bumps their knees, holds something hot, gets an insect bite or whatever else. I didn&#x27;t believe it at first &#x27;til the vein on my left hand inflamed in 15 minutes after hitting it on a signage. It hurts so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even lift a plate of pasta nor close my hand and hold a fork. When she found out what happened, she immediately placed some of this stuff. &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees! Burt&#x27;s Bees!&amp;#34; Uhuh. There she goes! She asked me to wait &#x27;til the pain goes away and I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;Yeah, right. If I&#x27;m lucky, this will go away after 2-3 days with cold compress or something.&amp;#34; I waited anyway and a miracle did happen. 30 minutes after, the pain started subsiding and I was alble to close my hand. 15 more minutes after that, the pain completely went away as if nothing happened to me! So yeahhh! Burt&#x27;s Bees! Burt&#x27;s Bees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s because of one of the ingeredients it has - Comfrey. This ingredient is reffered to as a &amp;#34;bone healer&amp;#34;. Too much of it though causes damage on the liver but I don&#x27;t think that Burt&#x27;s Bees Res-Q Ointment has too much of this ingredient that it can cause any harm. I use it on my kids and on myself. A real must-have!</li>
    <li> This is to buy for my daughter, she said it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to product when I get a bruise that I want to disappear quickly. It had a mild menthol-like smell but it works better than anything else.</li>
    <li> I always bring the Burt&#x27;s Bees Res-Q ointment with me, I can use it either as a minor pain relieve or lip balm. It&#x27;s very gentle and I can even apply it around my eyes and won&#x27;t get any irritation.</li>
    <li> I can affirm all the comments given, including that I keep spare cans to give away.  My grandson carries one in his backpack.  Having said that, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;essential for cold sores as well even though that is not an advertised purpose.  It worked so well on burns, cuts, etc. that when I had that tingling sensation heralding the impending visit of a cold sore on my lip I used the ResQ ointment.  I kept applying it until I no longer felt the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; or \\&quot;stitch\\&quot; sensation.  Suffice it to say I have never again had a cold sore successfully erupt.  This product is not meant to be ingested so if you use it on your lip don&#x27;t lick your lips, but it has been many years and this product has never failed to work for defeating a cold sore before it really becomes one as well as for all its other intended purposes.  I read a review here that says the ingredients have been changed which causes me some concern as to its continued efficacy for cold sores, but we&#x27;ll see what happens with the new cans I am ordering.  This review pertains to the product I and my family have been using for years.  I&#x27;ll update this review should it be necessary.</li>
    <li> I have found that this is wonderful for putting on a burn. Cool the burn first in cold water, then dry and add Res-Q Ointment and they seem to heal so much quicker and the pain seems to diminish almost instantly. I can&#x27;t find this in any local store so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Necessary for my life. It soothes and comforts life&#x27;s bumps and bruises with a powerful, yet gentle, blend of natural herbal ingredients.</li>
    <li> I live in south Florida and we have a lot of mosquitoes. This product is the ONLY THING that stops them from itching me to death. Love it! I want to buy it in bulk and keep some everywhere.</li>
