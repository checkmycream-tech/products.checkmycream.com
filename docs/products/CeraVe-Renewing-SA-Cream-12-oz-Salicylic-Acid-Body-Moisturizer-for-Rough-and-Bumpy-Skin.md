<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works!! It softens the eczema on my back so much I started using it all over!!</li>
    <li> Works well for sensitive dry skin on the face</li>
    <li> used it for a few eeks for little bumps on my arms. not magically by any means but it has kept the bumps undercheck. skin isnt as rough as it used to be. i stopped using it due to travel for a couple of weeks and bumps were back to normal. i think i just need to be more vigilent and use this regularly for a few months in a row and see how it works out.</li>
    <li> excellent product recommended by my dermotologist</li>
    <li> RECOMMENDED BY THE DERMATOLOGIST FOR DRY SKIN..SAYS IT IS THE BEST! ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU NEED TO USE A LOT, SO THE JAR WON&#x27;T LAST LONG.</li>
    <li> After lot of trial and error(tried most of the brand), I found a lotion which has completely cured my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> Tried once, and immediately bought another jar. Soaks in quickly, no after-film. Not sure I&#x27;m seeing results yet, but I definitely like the feel of the product. I do think it has helped to clear up and remove my raggedy cuticles. I typically use it after a shower and going to bed on hands, arms, elbows, and knees. This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist who likes the whole line of CeraVe products.</li>
    <li> this is the best lotion ever.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin!!!! I love it !!!</li>
    <li> It really helped with my son dry skin condition.  We are using these with the cerave moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it leaves your skin so&lt;br /&gt;Soft, better than cetaphil.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes like no other and is not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on our baby&#x27;s eczema. We&#x27;ve tried lots of creams and this has worked best so far for him.</li>
    <li> My son has mild eczema on his face, and I&#x27;ve tried every available product to clear it up. While I had some success with other brands in the past, his bumps and dryness would never go away entirely. But this cream changed everything. His skin is now soft, smooth and completely free of bumps and irritation. Please keep in mind that it takes a little time to see the full results (about two weeks in my case), but wow, is it ever worth the wait. His skin is like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the cream for Normal to Dry Skin in place of my night cream and my skin has never been softer. This brand is amazing!</li>
    <li> I wish it was a bigger container (not as large as the regular CeraVe in a tub) but it does well. I was recommended to purchase this by my dermatologist for my keratosis pilaris. The SA cream greatly reduced the size of the bumps on my legs and arms. My skin still isn&#x27;t as smooth as glass, but it&#x27;s a great deal better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price on Amazon is also much better than brick and mortar stores.</li>
    <li> After most of my young adult life when it seems I was devoted to being &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;  my skin has ended up being a dried up leathery mess. Nothing can fix that, but this cream has sure made a great improvement in the quality and softness of my very abused skin. The other great improvement I have noticed is that I don&#x27;t itch all the time. To get the maximum benefit use it twice a day and apply it generously. I also plan to try their eye cream. Please try it and I hope it helps.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I was using the lotion which didn&#x27;t seem to last very long. A little bit of this goes a long way. My dermatologist recommended this for my rough feet and it works great. It also took care of the little bumps on my upper arms. Nice light smell.</li>
    <li> Great stuff I recommend this cream if you have dry skin the best I have found to date</li>
    <li> I have used this on my legs for over a year and I really think is is effective.  Before my dry skin was crackled looking, but after regular use it has become soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only creams that moisturizes my eczema prone skin without irritating it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how bad keratosis pilaris was on my arms till recently when some of my friends noticed it. I settled on CeraVe SA after reading through various Rx options and reviews. I am glad I bought this. I have been using the cream for just about 3 days and I already see a lot of difference. My skin is much smoother with less bumps, although the pigmentation from KP is still there. I guess it may take weeks to fully clear up. The cream itself is pretty thick with a little medicated smell but nothing unbearable.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Wish I had discovered this product long ago.  I heard of it when a Dermatologist recommended it to a relative.</li>
    <li> I do not review too many items, however as an older female with large-pore, acne-scarred facial skin, who has used all of the expensive department store formulations, I was amazed to notice a positive difference in my skin, actually by surprise.  Prior experience with expensive products precluded high expectations on my part but I decided to give it a try as a night cream due to the fact that until recently it required a prescription to obtain.  After about three weeks, while looking in my magnifying mirror to apply makeup, and without even thinking about the fact that I was using a new night cream, I noticed a visible reduction in the size of my pores, less redness, and most noticeably, increased elasticity.  I had heard women talk about improved skin elasticity while reviewing various products over the years but was really amazed to see for myself that such an improvement really exists.  I cannot imagine anybody not seeing an improvement in facial skin with consistent nightly use.</li>
    <li> With winter here I have been rxperiencing the normal problems which include cracked dry skin, build up of dry skin, itching, redness. I have used a lot of CeraVe products on the reccomendation of my dermatologist.  Since my next appointment is a month away, I went to CVS to look over CeraVe&#x27;s offering during a sale. I bought this and was IMPRESSED. I used a couple of dots of this with water. It emulsified and created a mass of foam. I gently massaged my face and neck and rinsed with cool water, applied some CeraVe eye and facial moisturizer and went to bed. When I woke up the dry skin was gone, the skin calmed, and it looked both bright, soft, and younger. No more itching. Since I began using this blackheads are completely gone as is the dry skin and itching with absolutely no allergic reaction. This is a very good product and despite its price at regular retail, it lasts a long time. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> After years of prescriptions and doctors visits with little results this CeraVe did in a week what hundreds of dollars in prescribed salves did not do. I went to my doctor and told him that all he prescribed was worthless compared to this.</li>
    <li> this cream is fabulous, and is the first one to help my 2 boys&#x27; eczema! also the first to not make them&lt;br /&gt;cry upon application! thank you!</li>
    <li> VERY THICK &amp; SOOTHING. Because of the STEEP price, I got this to use sparingly ONLY on my lower legs, which are very dry &amp; sometimes affected by eczema. Regular lotions &amp; creams (natural or otherwise) have not done the trick. But this cream seems to work, keeping my legs smooth &amp; soothed. I will probably buy again, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darned expensive!</li>
    <li> One of the best creams I&#x27;ve used on my extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled with annoying (and embarrassing) dry, flaky elbows. I tried a little bit of everything -- heavy moisturizing creams, exfoliating gloves, scrubs, etc. Finally, I asked my dermatologist about it and she recommended that I try Cerave SA. She was very specific about trying the SA version. I was thrilled to find out it worked. It took about 1 week to completely eradicate the flakiness on one elbow and about a week and a half on the other elbow. It&#x27;s a God-send in the winter when my condition is the worse. Highly recommended for targeted treatments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using it as a full body lotion but wasn&#x27;t as satisfied. The rest of my body responds best to heavy moisturizers. But this stuff still works like nothing else to eradicate dead skin.</li>
    <li> The lotion is nice and strong. When I put the lotion on my psoriasis/eczema patches I can FEEL THE BURN!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream - absorbs well, is not sticky.</li>
    <li> Totally got rid of bumps on my upper and lower arms.  Stays on for hours but doesn&#x27;t feel slimy.  Also, helps with shave bumps.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist. I really like how smooth my face feels after using this product. It is a very heavy moisturizer so I use at night and was off in the morning.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Performs as described.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizing cream</li>
    <li> This SA Renewing Cream is simply the best moisturizer I have ever used---and I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free, I use it mainly at night on my feet and legs and my heels are very soft and stay that way for days.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is excellent for hands as well and after using it when I go to bed, my hands are still soft in the morning and my cuticles are soft and any cuts are healed.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to buy the SA cream, not just the CeraVe moisturizing cream. There is a great difference!</li>
    <li> This cream is the best I have ever used on my dry, rough feet.  I am being treated for Psoriasis on my feet and in between using a Steroid cream on them I am using this to help soften and smooth out the dry patches.  It is AMAZING.  My doctor told me he recommends this to all of his patients, who have dry feet, cracks in their heels, etc.  It&#x27;s best to put a pair of socks on to hold the effects in, but it is non-greasy so you can use it any time.  I HIGHLY support the recommendation that my doctor made.  Make sure you get the formula that has SA (Salicylic Acid) in it.</li>
    <li> This cream is VERY thick, but I like it.  The regular CeraVe PM I think was breaking me out a bit, so I thought I&#x27;d try the salicylic acid to help with my acne.  No pimples so far!  One thing I do though is use this as my last moisturizer, it&#x27;s so thick it almost reminds me of a sort of white Aquaphor that seals in your other products.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this lotion.  I tried it because of the SA. Seems to really help my face.</li>
    <li> This lotion works well for psoriasis on the soles of my feet. I put it on and then cover my feet with socks. This cream was recommended specifically by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Works well on problem skin.</li>
    <li> So I actually ended up buying it at a local pharmacy store only because the need was urgent, and I couldn&#x27;t afford to wait for prime shipping. I work a lot with latex gloves so when I started developing drier hands due to an unknown allergic reaction, my palm of my skin started to peel off and my dermatologist had confirmed that it was dyshidrotic eczema. This was in the winter too so my hands were extremely dry from the weather PLUS skin was peeling off and cracking often. I tried everything from multiple creams, to even the normal Cerave cream, but I noticed that this cream (for the extremely dry- Renewing SA CREAM) was the only one that did the job for me. I guess it has a higher concentration of ceramide in this cream since the ceramide is supposed to help treat the dryness. Within 3 days, my hands were &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and was much less dry. Within a week, my skin had stopped to crack/peel and ever since I had used this to treat my hands, the condition hasn&#x27;t returned yet. I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone with some sort of eczema- it really does the job!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It has helped with dry and cracked heels. It is a nice texture and absorbs easily.</li>
    <li> This cream sounds like it&#x27;s a better fit for those of us with eczema.  In fact, I contacted CeraVe to ask that question, and they confirmed.  However, I found it to be less effective (and significantly higher in price) than the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream for Normal to Dry Skin that I was previously using.</li>
    <li> This really works.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks for having it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product.  I put it on my face everyday.  I used to have red spots on my forehead but now they are no longer there.  This is the only product that I am using, so I have to say that the product is helping.  Take a chance and see what it can do for you.</li>
    <li> Great for very dry skin. It works!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best creams I have ever used. I have very dry itchy skin and this is the first of many creams that actually works.</li>
    <li> This cream is Fantastic!!!!!  Will take care of any dry skin you may have.  I use it on my hands and feet,  just avoid using on your toes if polished,  because the salicylic acid will change the color of your nail Polish.  Not greasy and the slight scent is negligible,  and Amazons price is nice too,  paid abt $22.00 for this at CVS!!!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff for ailing skin.</li>
    <li> Used on my face, this one is less greasy than the lotion. I hate how there is no pump nor seal on this tub. Works amazing for my acne, put on bumps that will become acne, they go away within two days without becoming red noticeable. I use it 3x a week.</li>
    <li> This cream has no scent and applies well. It doesn&#x27;t work magic, but it really does soften my rough calluses better than any other lotion. I wish it came in a 12 oz tube so it wouldn&#x27;t get as germy.</li>
    <li> OK, so this was a breakthrough cream for me, introduced to me from my dermatologist.  I am so grateful to get on Amazon.  I have keratosis on the back of my arms, and on the back of my thighs and it&#x27;s really important to clean and then put a cream on to capture the moisture (like after a bath/shower/washing....).  I know there are other products that do this too, and this one was really nice.  I actually have no bumps anymore. It took time, so if you think it&#x27;s over night it might not be.  I have recommended to my family and it has affected their skin in ways that other products didn&#x27;t.  Of course, everyone is different and the only way to find out is to try it yourself.  I think it would be worth the investment and to give it a go. It&#x27;s a cream (creams are more moisturizing than lotions) and even with eczema and psoriasis this does help retain moisture (not cure) and ease the pain and itching.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. I had high hopes this cream would help with dryness and flaky skin. Well I applied it to my face and it burned! And as a result it turned bright red. I do see now that it contains PEG&#x27;s. Propylene glycol is chemical which I am allergic to. Should have read ingredients more carefully! I will never use that again.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in other reviews, it&#x27;s a great product. However, I paid $29.99 and found it at my local CVS for $16.99. Look before you buy!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have health problems that cause very dry skin, and it works on the first application.  It absorbs into my skin without leaving a slick residue and does not &amp;#34;sweat off&amp;#34; no matter how much I apply. (I live in Alabama and of course heat/humidity is always an issue in spring and summer.). It also works very well on cracked heels.  I just wear clean, cotton socks for a little while after using on my feet.</li>
    <li> This cream is worth every penny and was recommended to me by my dermatologist. The salicylic acid helps with the bumps on my arms. I have also used Amlactin and this works just as well -- except the smell is much more tolerable.</li>
    <li> Great cream for dry skin.</li>
    <li> It is very thick and works.  It helped with my skin problem.  Dermatologist recommended.</li>
    <li> I am pretty new at using creams for dry skin.  Yet Cerave moistens to a level that is really healing. I use it on face and body twice a day and there is a great difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Soaks in quickly, and fixes my dry feet. Any flaking, or cracking, is repaired. I apply at least once a week, then after a minute or so, I put on socks, shoes, and I&#x27;m good to go. This was recommended for my feet by my female dermatologist. Could be used on any dry body area, even face, I&#x27;ll bet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Indian so I&#x27;m very ashy, but my feet are dry and crackling too. This is literally the only one that actually lasts! I&#x27;m impressed. It&#x27;s the only body lotion I use now.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my doctor and works well for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for eczema</li>
    <li> Cerave SA was prescribed for me by my dermatologist. I got my first product from him. The difference in the texture of my skin is fantastic. Being well over 70 years old and diabetic, my skin needs every bit of help I can get. This product helps tremendously!</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended by my doctor for an allergic reaction that caused my skin to itch. It really helped soften and moisturize my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and priced good! Leaves you skin SO SOFT. And stays on a long time.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this, and it is great! A little expensive, but heals very dry skin. Excellent skin cream!</li>
    <li> Awesome cream!  As an adult with frequent acne I have been treated with everything the dermatologists can think of.  Things work for awhile but it always comes back.  NOW, as long as I use my Differin nightly and then use the cerave on top of it, I have no problems to speak of.  Yay for Cerave!!  Saw it as I was about to order regular Cerave, rec&#x27;d by my doctor, and gave it a try.  I will never go back.</li>
    <li> I swim daily and this product works...I use it all over, not just on my hands.</li>
    <li> This cream does very little for people with psoriasis. If you have psoriasis this cream does not last to keep your skin moist.&lt;br /&gt;I have psoriasis when applying this cream to open sores on the skin this cream causing burning. As we all know skin dries out and cracking occurs&lt;br /&gt;causing open sores on the skin. My best advice do not waste your money on this ineffective cream.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I use it on my feet, legs and arms. It&#x27;s very soothing and softening. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other creams to help with my KP issues... This by far and away has been my best discovery.</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry skin and am always on the lookout for a deep, rich cream. I usually use Cetaphil cream which works quite well. But every so often I get scaly or dry spots which can be quite itchy. I found this stuff and use it on problem areas (with Eucerin Eczema cream). Sometimes those dry, scaly, itchy spots are on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few days, my face looks softer, smoother and younger. I am so surprised! Sure it&#x27;s expensive, but if you have dry skin on your face, it&#x27;s certainly not any more expensive than those overpriced department store creams. I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is more expensive than anything else I&#x27;ve tried for the dry, peeling and cracked skin on my face and hands.  This is also the only product that has ever worked - within days my skin was noticeably improved.  In a week my peeling, dry skin was smooth and soft.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this - one reviewer wondered where this had been all her young (33 yrs) life, I&#x27;m 63 and just discovered it.  I hadn&#x27;t even thought of using it only feet, but I will start tonite!&lt;br /&gt;Cunfunit</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my face - best cream ever!!</li>
    <li> Incredible! Had eczema all my life (61 now) &amp; this works better than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever used to moisturize.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe it took me 33 years of my life to find this product.  Well, I&#x27;m sure it hasn&#x27;t been in existence for that long, but it is truly a miracle product for which the world is now a better place due to it having been invented.  I have always had incredibly dry, cracked hands and feet - not sure why because I have a white collar desk job and am not particularly handy.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different lotions, bag balms, creams, epsom salts, gloves, pumice stones, etc. and NOTHING has worked.  On a random visit to a dermatologist, he noticed my dry hands and suggested this product - specifically noting that the SA (salicylic acid) formula works wonders.  Lo and behold, within a week of using it once in the AM and once in the PM, my hands are literally normal again.  I feel like a real human and I no longer am afraid to shake hands with someone!  While it&#x27;s a little more expensive than your run-of-the-mill hand lotion, you will be amazed at the results - it is absolutely magical.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. Better than Am Lactin, carmol, sween cream, ect. The BEST for fixing extremely dry scaly parched  skin- awesome !  You&#x27;ll need a few days for your skin to adjust to high level of salicylic acid. The product&#x27;s really great at smoothing and exfoliating the dead, scaly, lizard skin.  it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s $5 cheaper on Amazon than at Walgreens. I put it on 2-3 times per day, and by day 10, all of my skin was soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This was recommendec to me by my dermatologist for chronically dry, cracking heels. It not only softens, within days of your first use it actually helps to loosen those cracked areas so that they can easily be filed off. This stuff works!</li>
    <li> I had a horrible problem with dry itchy skin on my forearms. My dermatologist recommended this and I have used it every day after my shower and I have no more itching problem. If I need renewal during the day, I use the lotion form for a light retouch if I have been wearing long sleeves, as it tends to not last as long due to this.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for very dry and bumpy skin.  Sor far, this is the best cream on the market for a dry and bumpy skin.  My dermatologist recommended this brand (specifically SA Renewing Cream) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This CeraVe SA renewing cream has greatly improved the kp on my arms. I&#x27;ve used it now for over 2 months, applying generously 3-4 times per week after showering. I use it on my legs and feet too. I&#x27;ve tried everything for the kp (keratosis pilaris) on my arms... Rx urea, Rx salicylic acid, differin, tazorac, retin A, Amlactin etc. and most over the counter stuff including Paula&#x27;s choice 2% BHA body treatment (love her other stuff - gentle face washes and shampoo), Derma doctor scrub, oils lotions etc etc. For those of you that battle kp you&#x27;ve likely done the same. For me this is the best and unlike some of the stronger Rx products it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation. It&#x27;s not a miracle but I&#x27;ve seen actual improvement (much smoother and less redness) and it&#x27;s pleasant to use. It does stay a bit tacky after application but I just wear a super thin sleeved tee to bed and it&#x27;s good by morning. The lotion version is good too but much less effective... Paula&#x27;s choice reviews said that the cream has a better pH for kp treatment. I do use the lotion in between my applications of this cream though.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this renewing cream.&lt;br /&gt;It really does just as it says, it restores your dry skin to it&#x27;s natural state.&lt;br /&gt;I had very dry skin, and tiny bumps on my arms, and they started to disappear after only one use.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy, but leaves a nice healthy glow to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema for 50+ years and tried every topical remedy under the sun, but somehow had never tried, or even heard of, CeraVe. I purchased CeraVe SA cream about two weeks ago on the recommendation of a friend and it&#x27;s been life-changing. I&#x27;ve never used a topical product that has yielded more dramatic results. I have dry, bumpy, itchy skin head to toe with chronic, weeping eczema on my hands, arms and legs. My skin is so much smoother and more hydrated in just a few weeks. I can&#x27;t get over it. My eczema is much less red and irritated. I&#x27;m astonished!! My husband has terrible keratosis pilaris and he&#x27;s also had fantastic results. I will never, ever be without this cream. I would highly recommend it for anyone who has sensitive, dry, bumpy or eczema-prone skin. I was a regular user of Cetaphil, Eucerin and Psysiogel creams. None of them are even remotely as effective as CeraVe.</li>
    <li> This has helped my skin &amp;#34;renew&amp;#34; better than anything I have ever used. So glad my doctor recommended it!  I just wish the price was a little lower as I use so much it gets quite expensive.  I use it head to toe twice a day.</li>
    <li> Works great, used on my feet  best moisterizing cream I have used.</li>
    <li> Truly amazing cream for the skin. Highly recommend it.  See my review on the Cerave SA Renewing Skin Lotion for details how well their products work!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Podiatrist for very dry skin, especially on heels.  Excellent product.  Certainly better than many others, including Vaseline. It rubs in and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I like all the CereVe products, You can&#x27;t beat the price for  the dermatologist recommended ingredients!</li>
    <li> My skin is super dry and while I do add a little Vaseline with this, it has helped a great deal to combat winter dryness.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s doctor wanted her to use it and my wife&#x27;s hands have never been better.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from KP bumps and ingrown hairs for a really long time ( over a decade now). I have tried so many things to get rid of these bumps. A little background into my personal situation is that I have a milk chocolate skin tone and it is generally very silky smooth. My skins main issue beside the KP is that my skin is very sensitive and prone to dryness ( I have read that KP and ingrown hairs are common in those who have sensitive skin since KP is a overproduction of keritin to protect the skin [is the guess] but it is genetic and usually rarely goes away for most [ contrary to popular belief]). So I have had these bumps for so long and I have tried exfoliates and moisturizers but in vain. My problem areas are the backs of my arms especially around the elbows,the front of my thighs and the most severe place is the bottom half of my legs around the knee area. My main issue was to smooth the bumpy texture of these bumps. I always used shower puffs and Aveeno ( as my general daily moisturizer I still use it) and most recently Goldbond for Rough and Bumpy Skin. The Goldbond moisterizer was a 6/10 because it really aided the bumps on my thighs and the back of my arm but did nothing for my most severe location by my knees. After I waxed again ingrown hairs arrived on my thighs and the Goldbond did nothing so I decided to find a new solution.&lt;br /&gt;  I always used Cerave products but the price on this lotion really had me holding back from trying it but I finally did and I am so glad I did. I have been using to for only a month now but within the first few days there was a noticeable change and the bumps are all smoothed out. Unlike other moisturizers like the Goldbond it does not peel off and for a thick lotion it absorbs quickly into the skin. I use it every day, after I shower I just stand for about 5 minutes to make sure it fully absorbs and I thought I would never feel my silky smooth skin on my legs again but I finally did! I paired the Cerave with exfoliation for maximum results  used Earth Therapeutics Hydro Exfoliating glove as well and Gigi no bumps body scrub and both of them left my skin sooooo soft after showering but the Cerave just got rid of the rest of the bumps. I strongly recommend this for anyone suffering from KP and ingrown hairs! Especially if you have a bump issue. I am dark skin so the appearance of KP bumps discoloration is not to noticeable on my skin but I did notice a little fade in discoloration but not a whole lot so far after 2 weeks or so all my bumps smoothed and only time will tell if the discoloration will go away signifcantly. Overall a 10/10! 5 stars! I can&#x27;t believe it works! I recommend it to anyone but remember to exfoliate as well for best results. Hope this long review helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/6/2017: ( The picture is from the beginning of 2017. After using the product for a few months after purchasing it in 2015, this was my results and they have been consistant since [throughout the rest of 2015-2016 and now 2017].) After using this product for about almost two years now it has worked very well! I regret not taking before shots because I assumed like all the other products I tried that it would not work or do anything, so there was no point! Ugh! I regret it! This product still works for me and I am happy my skin has not adjusted to it. My routine is the same,an exfoliating glove, dove soap, my GiGi scrub and Aveeno lotion that is fragrance free. I was about once a month because I generally am not harry and I exfoliate before and after my waxes and I use this to moisturize for about a week after my wax. I also use it randomly, especially when cold even if it has been weeks since I waxed. My bumps are still visible, but has lightened only slightly. I have darker skin so they do not show up anyways. Like I said before my texture and the feel of the bumps was my concern and still is. This product has left my skin soooo smooth I feel like I never had KP bumps! My final verdict is that this is perfect for smoothing those bumps, but if you are concern with discoloration this will help but you will need something extra. However, this is still great for those with dry, KP and ingrown hair prone skin. Hope I helped :)t is that this is perfect for smoothing those bumps, but if you are concern with discoloration this will help but you will need something extra. However, this is still great for those with dry, KP and ingrown hair prone skin. Hope I helped :)</li>
    <li> Have used this everyday for the last 6 months.  I&#x27;ve struggled with eczema most of my life, and have tried every lotion under the sun to try and prevent outbreaks.  I was previously using Palmer&#x27;s for dry, ashy skin because it has the SA in it, but had a really hard time finding it in the store.  I also think there&#x27;s ingredients in there that are probably irritating for skin.  This product seems like it&#x27;s more gentle on my skin, while also preventing any outbreaks.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dry skin since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I&#x27;ve also started using it on the backs on my arms to try and address some bumpy skin there and I believe it&#x27;s been helping with that also.</li>
    <li> The is the only cr&amp;egrave;me that heals my husband&#x27;s rough skin. Buying it on Amazon is so easy. My husband says this is the best cr&amp;egrave;me available.</li>
    <li> Nice thicker cream for dryer skin</li>
    <li> This cream is the only that I&#x27;ve found that actually has made my legs smooth and not scaly and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> It is a nice moisturizer, but it is no miracle cream. My daughter has keratosis pilaris and I was hoping to get something to help with the bumps. It didn&#x27;t work for us. I don&#x27;t see a change at all in the bumps, though her skin is softer after I apply it. I guess any moisturizer will usually do that though.</li>
    <li> If you have extremely dry skin heals elbows or knees. Then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Recommended for use on skin during radiation therapy and it was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much that I&#x27;ve been using it on my face, neck and hands as well. Will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry and CeraVe hydrates well and leaves skin soft while feeling light.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Exactly what I ordered.  Lots, so I don&#x27;t have to re-order so soon.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and sensitive dry skin. I have used many different retail products including Aveeno eczema therapy moisturizing cream, Cetaphil moisturizing cream. Some of Aveeno&#x27;s product has been the product I stay with, because it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itchy as much. But the moisture doesn&#x27;t stay long. I&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil which I feel it to be sticky and itchy that I wanted to wash that away immediately. After hearing Cerave, I&#x27;ve used two of their products - Moisturizing cream and Renewing SA Cream. I see tremendous result by just using it less than a week.  I feel my skin is hydrate by applying once and it last more than 24 hours. The most important thing, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin sticky or oily. So no itchy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for KP bumps I sometimes get on my arms - I found it to work moderately well for that. It is rich, scent free and absorbs well into the skin. This beta hydroxy formula I found to be helpful to skin health and it clears and helps diminish warts and tags and such - it is of course, a renewing cream, but I was quite pleasantly surprised by that. For such a generous amount of product, I think it is cost effective and marvelous. I was using Eucerin&#x27;s itchy skin during the winter, and I may just switch over to this. You must be consistent with it (I put it on my KP prone areas every night) and you will be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Moisturizing cream. It is great for your dry legs and dry feet. I use this on my skin after showers and put it on my feet and put socks on. It has been amazing and really healed my dry cracked skin. My husband loves it too!</li>
    <li> This really works! Nothing more needs to be said or written.</li>
    <li> it is really helping my scaley skin</li>
    <li> This is  my favorite moisturizing cream. It&#x27;s super rich and it makes your skin feel fantastic after a shower. I have really dry skin especially in the winter...I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Well worth the price</li>
    <li> I almost don&#x27;t want to say anything after reading these raves.But maybe this will be helpful to someone.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered via Walmart for 19.99. I am 47 with normal skin but I am starting to see some textural changes in the skin on my body. I had recently started a new regime on my face ( Good Housekeeping&#x27;s Rules for Anti-aging as seen on Dr Oz. ( Here is the link; [...]). I had some real improvement using their suggestions.So I decide to extend these techniques to include my body. So I have been looking for a cream with salicylic acid and ceramides. I am a big fan of their day cream: Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients I am looking for show up eighth on the list. Not good. According to P. Begoin (Author of \\&quot;Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me\\&quot;) ingredients should be at least 7th. I know it is close but,... I have been using this cream daily for about 3 weeks and I am not seeing much of a difference. Not significant enough to warrant $20 a jar. But after reviewing some of the comments I am going to use it twice a day and if that proves beneficial I will change my review. All In all it was an okay lotion but definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This cream feels so luxurious as it&#x27;s smoothed on!  My dermatologist suggested it to help my psoriasis - moisturizing is the key, she said!  It did help ease the flaking and discomfort, but it did a whole lot more for my skin than just the affected areas.  I have smoother skin and I can even use it on my face without breaking out ( which is common for me with other lotions).  I was surprised because I usually prefer a lotion in a pump for ease of use, but this cream is worth the extra effort.  My cuticles are in better shape, too!</li>
    <li> Great. Super moisturizing</li>
    <li> Helped my son&#x27;s eczema. Tried different products like Aveeno, Vani cream, but none helped. After using the product, the flare ups have reduced a lot. the frequency of applying steroids has reduced a lot. It is non greasy. I moisturize him twice a day. I would definitely recommend this product!! I just did not know how to control my Son&#x27;s eczema before using this product..this has been a real life saver in my case!!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice, thick cream.  It think when I run out of my current expensive face cream, I&#x27;m switching to this as it&#x27;s done rather well for the rest of my skin.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical to try this,mostly due to the price,but it had so many 5 star ratings. I have pretty dry skin all the time &amp; some keratosis pilaris on the back of my upper arms &amp; legs. By the 2nd day,I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin was! My husband noticed also. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue either. I will definately keep using this!</li>
    <li> Since Pacquins medicated hand cream (purple lid) became unavailable, I&#x27;ve been looking for a cream I could use at night on my hands. This is it. I&#x27;m 72, and my hands look 30 years younger than my arms. No brown spots.  I used Pacquins for 40 years. I hope this has the same good effect.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. Dealt with my son&#x27;s raw skin for 2 mos and this cleared it up in about a week.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of the 12oz CeraVe cream.  One Container came sealed and the 2nd one was not sealed.  I think it could have been tampered with or even used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, it works great on the skin, but I wish the QA/QC was better from the vendor</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommend  that I use for extremely dry skin , and rough spots on my elbows  they are now soft. They make no claims about lighting age spots  BUT after a week I see a distinct lightning of the spots.</li>
    <li> I have been looking and looking for a body peel.  I was severely hydrated several months ago and I could still see and feel the effects on my skin.  CeraVe SA is remarkable. Immediate results.  I also bought the undereye product ,hand cream and lotion.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here.  I especially had confidence since my dermatologist recommended it (there are no body peels). It is non-presecription.  Lotion is less at CVS, Cream is less expensive at Amazon.  Go for it - you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years on my feet.  For some reason, in the winter they are very dry and cracked.  They improve somewhat in the summer, I guess because  the is more humidity in the air, but I still have callusy ugly heals.  Once I began using this product daily  after showering, I saw marked improvement.  I have normal looking feet and am not afraid to wear sandals. Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This cream works great on my body, but not on face. I have extremely dry &amp; sensitive skin with eczema from birth. I had high hopes up for CeraVe Cream because many people recommended it. Unfortunately, it irritates and sore when I used it on my face and also redness all over face like on fire. If someone experienced same problem as I did, you better try Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing. Aveeno Cream feels slightly less moisture than CeraVe, but it doesn’t irritate or sore my face. I’m currently using CeraVe cream on body,  Aveeno Cream on face and both works so far so good.</li>
    <li> I can highly recommend all of the CeraVe products.  This particular SA cream works well on extremely dry areas and has wonderful renewing qualities.  I use the regular CeraVe after a shower and use this for particularly dry spots and feet.</li>
    <li> Great cream.  My husband uses for his rough heels on his feet and if you use this every night/or morning for this reason, your heels will feel so much softer.  He highly recommends this cream if you have rough heels like he does.</li>
    <li> works just like the dock ordered.</li>
    <li> Aging dry skin that I couldn&#x27;t seem to rehydrate.  Made an appt. then &amp; dermatologist then recommended CeraVe and that I use for a couple of months.  If my skin didn&#x27;t improve to come back.  Expensive but well worth it.  My skin has rehydrated with renewed elasticity.  Like the feel and lack of fragrance.  Definitely will keep using.</li>
    <li> I have the driest hands in the world!  Well, I did.  Thanks to CeraVe SA Renewing Cream, my hands have been revived!&lt;br /&gt;HALLELUJAH!!!! I have tried every product on the market.  Well not every, because I did not know about CeraVe.  I honestly do not go shopping.  I have totally been relying on AMAZON to educate me.  All of your reviews and suggestions really save me.&lt;br /&gt;So, I am a little OCD when it comes to washing my hands.  I will &amp;#34;occasionally&amp;#34; wear gloves, just don&#x27;t feel like putting on gloves when I see a spot here or there.  Having a dog made me self-conscious about cleanliness.  And trust me, I play with her, rub her, ALL THE TIME, so when I finish &amp;#34;mommy and GiGi time&amp;#34;, which could be anytime, I head for the soap and water.  People often tell me they can&#x27;t tell my age.  But my hands were a clear give-away.  I just couldn&#x27;t have that.&lt;br /&gt;So my search began, and OMG! This is by far the BEST hand and body cream that I have EVER used.  My Sweetie came home for a brief (3-day) visit, and the first thing he said was, OOH BABY, YOU ARE SO SOFT!!! WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING/&lt;br /&gt;I blame it on the CeraVe SA !!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend of mine who I haven&#x27;t given it to yet, so I can&#x27;t tell you what it is like.  However, her doctor recomended this product, so I anticipate the cream will be great.</li>
    <li> Very good cream for excessively dry skin, no overpowering aroma, absorbed into skin fairly quickly!</li>
    <li> The best lotion for my 1 year old&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not greasy, but makes your hands or legs smooth and it&#x27;s great for your cuticles too.  Removes age spots and will shrink moles.  You can&#x27;t go wrong, try it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended and surpassed every thing she said it would.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Best face cream ever!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I never take the time to write reviews for ANYTHING. So, with that said, this product must be pretty amazing. The ONLY reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month so it hasn&#x27;t really been too long yet. First I will explain how I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from KP on my arms, upper legs and under my neck area for as long as I can remember. Every doctor has given me a different explanation and told me that it would be something I would eventually grow out of. I&#x27;m 26 and that hasn&#x27;t happened yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a generous amount of this product on my arms, upper legs, and face and neck. I have found that to keep my KP under control, exfoliating is a MUST. So a long with exfoliating these areas almost every time I shower, I follow with this moisturizer. And wow. What a difference!!!! I may have a bump here and there on my upper arms, but it is so minimal compared to what it was. Also my face and neck areas are so smooth it&#x27;s crazy. It seems to also be evening out my skin tone. I really can&#x27;t rave enough about this product. I will continue to use it but only in those areas because it is definitely pricey. I bought it at bed bath and beyond the first time and it is almost $10 cheaper on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be re-purchasing and probably trying to conserve this product a little better. I tend to over moisturize and I believe a little of this product goes a long way. I hope this review helps because some of the ones I read were not even about this product?!? So I just wanted to confirm that my review is for this amazing, CeraVe SA Renewing Cream ;)</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and the Dr. recommended I get this to help take the scales off my fingers and since it has the SA in it, it does help rid the flakes.  Also softens your skin.  Bought the regular CeraVe at WalMart, but they didn&#x27;t care this one.</li>
    <li> Would rather have a tube but they don&#x27;t seem to make a large tube.</li>
    <li> This creme  keeps my diabetic feet smooth! Very pleased.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT moisture retention! This cream left my skin a little sticky until it dried completely so I always make sure to apply it a little while before bedtime since I tend to sleep on my face (: I have tried several of the Cerave products and I have NEVER been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very good cream...nice size jar for the money.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I don&#x27;t care for the scent.  I wouldn&#x27;t say the scent is foul...it has a clinical smell.  I would definitely purchase it again because it works really well.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Seems to work well on helping to smooth skin.</li>
    <li> A little background on my skin: I suffer from mild/moderate psoriasis.  I have tried prescription interventions to treat this condition, but as of late I am managing it well with OTC and natural products.  Taking a high grade fish oil and using tea tree oil topically used to be my skin life savers.  However, after a few years my body did not respond to this regimen.  Next I moved on to a lotion from Alba for people with extra dry skin.  At first I thought that product was great, but it began to aggravate my symptoms.  The silicone content in the product is too high and the film it left over my skin made it unable to breathe, resulting in bumps, rashes, and psoriasis flare-ups .  I make sure to exfoliate a couple of times a week in the shower, but even that had limited efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is phenomenal.  It makes an excellent overnight treatment if you want to wake up with great skin.  My mother was amazed at how well it softened and smoothed my skin.  It turned my dry and peeling elbows (along with my knees and feet) into skin like a baby.  It can sting a little if you have open sores, but it is not overwhelming.  In fact, the sensation went away after a few seconds and I do not experience this with each application.  If you are someone with dry skin that just won&#x27;t give you a break, I highly recommend this.  I have abandoned my staple body moisturizer(cetaphil cream) for this miracle in a jar.  It is rich and perfect for cold weather if lotions don&#x27;t quite do it for you.  It is more expensive than Gold Bond&#x27;s Rough and Bumpy skin cream, but I could not take the sour smell of that product.  I am sensitive to smells and thankfully CeraVe Renewing SA Cream is fragrance free.  I purchased mine at my local CVS and my only regret is that I did not put it in a decent enough hiding place because folks in my house are using it up.  Individual results will vary and you may be hesitant to try it because of the cost, but if your skin is stubborn and unresponsive like mine, take a leap of faith.  The first night my skin was transformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the cream can feel sticky, which is why I recommend it mostly for night time use.  It is more noticeable if you use it all over during the day, but if you wear it overnight, by morning the stickiness is gone. If you have to wear it during the day, I would focus on specific dry areas.  And make sure to wear sunscreen as the ingredients sensitize your skin.e, take a leap of faith.

    <li> I started having really bad eczema on my face with rashes developing all over my face and dry, rough, itchy patches.  Went to the dermatologist  and he recommended  this.  I used a topical steroid for 2 days to get rid of the inflammation and started this cream and Within a few days all the rough dry patches and itchy Ness went away! Been using it twice a day for 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen my skin look this great! I also use aquaphor  on top of it at night and sometimes during the day. Tried sooooo many others and this one really restored the moisture and skin integrity.</li>
    <li> As a nurse who&#x27;s always having to wash my hands, I also have an autoimmune disorder that weakens my immune system; so you can only imagine how many times I have to wash my hands on a daily basis to lessen my chances of spreading &amp;/or getting a viral or bacterial infection that could take me or anyone else out of commission for quite some time. The wintertime, as you can imagine, makes the dryness even that much worse. So, when I wash wash wash, what little moisture I have left goes right down the drain; leaving my knuckles cracked &amp; bleeding. Like most women, I have tons &amp; tons of hand creams, lotions, moisturizers, etc...but NONE of them last on my skin at all nor do any of them penetrate deep enough to keep the dryness away. Licking your lips to moisturize them when they&#x27;re dry is the same as all the lotions/hand creams/moisturizers/etc...Sure. It&#x27;ll give you moisture you need but only lasting for a quick moment. I needed something that was gonna last. Desperate for relief, I went shopping and came across CeraVe Renewing SA Cream. The first time I tried it I was automatically hooked. Ingredients include: 1.)salicylate acid &amp; 2.)ammonium lactate- helps loosen dead skin; allowing for deeper penetration for maximum effectiveness 3.)hyaluranic acid- to attract moisture to the top layer of the skin. Where the other lotions moisturize like licking your lips to get moisture relief,..CeraVe Renewing SA Cream moisturized like the best top of the line lip balm you&#x27;ve ever had! (hopefully this analogy made sense)  I have never given any products an Amazon review before but this product is so great it deserves one! If you suffer from extreme dryness, psoriasis, eczema, etc...and haven&#x27;t found relief yet...do yourself a favor, get this product and try it out. You&#x27;ll kick yourself for not having tried it sooner.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
