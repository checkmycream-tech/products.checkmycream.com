      <li>The natural look and feel of the bamboo and wood are very appealing.</li>
      <li>I really like this and the wood is very smooth.</li>

      <li>more give and not as much pull.</li>
      <li>I love the Body Shop bamboo hairbrush so much.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good wooden hair brush with wooden bristles, that is well made, light weight and is nice to hold in your hand.</li>
      <li>Came quickly.</li>
      <li>It really helped in my hair-growing process!!</li>
      <li>Wooden hair brushes are worth every cent more!</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my daughter and it works much better than my old wood bristle brush.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>but it is far better for her than my brush.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it when I bought it, but the actual bristles are made of bamboo, so they&#x27;re strong (plastic ones bust in time), and also brush smoothly.</li>
      <li>This brush was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I will use this one in a pinch, but in the meantime bought a traditional blow-dry Conair brush that seems to do the trick much better.</li>
      <li>I do suggest conditioning it with some coconut or argon oil first, as this is how I got my results.</li>
      <li>This hairbrush seems to be free of chemical odors and using it makes my hair shinier and soft.  </li>
      <li>I really like the bamboo pins!  </li>
      <li>I have very fine long hair</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and this seems to work better than most brushes.  </li>
      <li>I also never realized how much static bristles produce - I thought I was cursed with perpetually static-y hair.</li>
      <li>I love my brush, I have very long hair</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair quite so much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t break as much</li>
      <li>Makes my hair staticky and doesn&#x27;t brush it very well.</li>
      <li>It is real bamboo.</li>
      <li>Nice quality and should last a long time.</li>
      <li>It took me a long time to find something that was both vegan friendly and non damaging.</li>
      <li>highly recommended over plastic/synthetic hair tools</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I can really notice the difference between this and my old plastic hairbrush.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really a fanatic about my brushes</li>
      <li>I have fine, dark brown wavy to curly hair.</li>
      <li>This is the first time that i use a wooden brush, my old one was a steal and it makes my hire electrified !</li>
      <li>No static electricity like plastic hairbrush... easy to grip and doesn&#x27;t easily get wet  in the bathroom!!</li>
      <li>Definitely reduces frizz, is gentle on hair  </li>
      <li>It worked very well and only saw three hairs in the brush after 100 strokes.</li>
      <li>If you have a sensitive scalp this is the brush for you.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get in the hair as well as my old brush.</li>
      <li>It seems to be well built so far.  </li>
      <li>It does not glide through my hair like the old one did at all.</li>
      <li>i love this brush, it is so gentle on my long extremely thick hair but invigorating to the scalp.</li>
      <li>Quality that will last you a long time if you be moderately gentle with it.&lt;br /&gt;Male</li>
      <li>It causes less breakage than traditional metal or plastic brushes and significantly less static.</li>

<li> a little over priced.....</li>
<li> I do not know if it is the width of the bristle or those round tipped</li>
<li> Missing a pin, but I wont complain about it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was looking for a good wooden hair brush with wooden bristles, that is well made, light weight and is nice to hold in your hand. It may not be a great hair brush for short hair or for people who need more bristles to do their hair styling, but its perfect for me and i like the massage when i&#x27;m brushing my hair, so I&#x27;d recommend you try it and make your own decision whether its for you or not.</li>
    <li> Half of the bristles fall off from the comb after a year of regular use. I have short hair and use it just 3-4 times a week. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Definitely reduces frizz, is gentle on hair  Cons:  Do NOT use with wet hair, I think it damages the brush.</li>
    <li> I would defiantly recommend this brush!  It took me a long time to find something that was both vegan friendly and non damaging. (If the bristles aren&#x27;t boar they are almost always nylon, which can tear the hair.)  I am so happy to have found something affordable, cruelty free and good for my hair!</li>
    <li> You know what they say.. once you go bamboo, you never go back.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I have fine hair that tangles easily, so brushing can be a chore.  Now I see it as part of my daily, de-stress meditation.  I also never realized how much static bristles produce - I thought I was cursed with perpetually static-y hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell or how it brushed my hair. I don&#x27;t like the nobs on the bamboo bristles. I prefer plain wooden bristles and&lt;br /&gt;not bamboo. I do like wooden brushes but not this one.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite brush.  I really like the bamboo pins!  I&#x27;m not really a fanatic about my brushes but my daughter is.  When she saw that I got this, she tried it, and then she had to have one too.  It&#x27;s her favorite brush now too!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush so far.  I have thick hair and this seems to work better than most brushes.  It doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair quite so much.  (I hope it lasts a long time.  Will revise my review if it breaks quickly or anything, but I am quite happy so far.)  I like the feel of it and the way it works.  The natural look and feel of the bamboo and wood are very appealing.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Body Shop metal pin brush, which sadly met its fate when my daughter threw it in the toilet. I was hoping to find another metal pin brush, but the bamboo pins were recommended so I gave it a try, and I was a little disappointed. For my baby-fine but very thick hair, this brush is not ideal. It doesn&#x27;t get in the hair as well as my old brush. I will use this one in a pinch, but in the meantime bought a traditional blow-dry Conair brush that seems to do the trick much better.</li>
    <li> Missing a pin, but I wont complain about it. Feels good against my scalp.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush is great! I purchased this for my daughter and it works much better than my old wood bristle brush. It has small knobs on the Ned&#x27;s of each bristle and it somehow doesn&#x27;t hurt her when using it as my brush does. I do not know if it is the width of the bristle or those round tipped ends but it is far better for her than my brush. She still has very fine hair that tangles easily and this has been a godsend.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush seems to be free of chemical odors and using it makes my hair shinier and soft.  I love bamboo!</li>
    <li> This is the first time that i use a wooden brush, my old one was a steal and it makes my hire electrified !&lt;br /&gt;This brush is very gentle on the hire and the scalp and the quality is AMAZING !</li>
    <li> Makes my hair staticky and doesn&#x27;t brush it very well.</li>
    <li> soooo nice on my hair, distributes natural oils evenly throughout the hair shaft. It really helped in my hair-growing process!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I use it everyday and it makes my hair softer. Helps untangle hair and adds shine. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Small but does the job well.  i love this brush, it is so gentle on my long extremely thick hair but invigorating to the scalp.</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> If you have a sensitive scalp this is the brush for you. Not scratchy and goes through my hair smoothly. I would definitely recommend this product for my friends.</li>
    <li> I love my brush, I have very long hair and it does the job without ripping out my hair.</li>
    <li> Ordered this off a daughter&#x27;s wish list.  Arrived very promptly and looks very nice.  Not sure how the concept of bamboo bristles came about, but this brush definitely has bamboo bristles.  If in the market for this kind of brush, get this one.</li>
    <li> This brush is very nice. I don&#x27;t use a brush usually but thought I would give this one a try because it is wooden and the teeth are far apart.

    <li> I really like this and the wood is very smooth. I have very fine long hair and it seems to slip through it easily without getting tangled or damaged.</li>
    <li> it is good...a little over priced.....</li>
    <li> Just bought this with prime shipping.  Came quickly. I can really notice the difference between this and my old plastic hairbrush.  It seems to be well built so far.  It feels amazing as it stimulates the scalp.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t break as much and it seems softer.  I&#x27;m enjoying the product a lot and would recommend it to others.  Wooden hair brushes are worth every cent more!</li>
    <li> Awesome hair brush. Does not pull or break hair. In fact it&#x27;s a great detangler. Nice quality and should last a long time. Great for any hair type.&lt;br /&gt;Great Buy..</li>
    <li> highly recommended over plastic/synthetic hair tools</li>
    <li> I love the Body Shop bamboo hairbrush so much. I&#x27;ve been using their bamboo hairbrush for so many years. After my 1st one got broken, I ordered the 2nd one from Amazon. The product arrived as expected.&lt;br /&gt;This is a amazing brush. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for. It has made my hair smoother and shinier. It causes less breakage than traditional metal or plastic brushes and significantly less static. I do suggest conditioning it with some coconut or argon oil first, as this is how I got my results.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush. Comfortable to use, comfortable to hold. Didn&#x27;t realize it when I bought it, but the actual bristles are made of bamboo, so they&#x27;re strong (plastic ones bust in time), and also brush smoothly. Plus they don&#x27;t create static electricity as plastic ones sometimes do. This is a great brush. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Good! No static electricity like plastic hairbrush... easy to grip and doesn&#x27;t easily get wet  in the bathroom!! Considering the price, it is really good deal!</li>
    <li> Quality that will last you a long time if you be moderately gentle with it.&lt;br /&gt;Male with coarse thick hair and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Great product. Feels durable. It is real bamboo. It feels really nice in my hair and on my head. I have fine, dark brown wavy to curly hair. I like it! It only took 3 business days to arrive.</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I was doing the no-poo method with my hair.  I was using a boar bristle brush, but with my curly hair, the bristles were breaking.  I decided to go with a bamboo brush.  I found this one and bought it because it was cheap and I could get it in 2 days with my prime membership.  This brush is great!!  Even though I&#x27;m not doing no-poo anymore, I still use this brush every day.</li>
    <li> The pins are too stiff for me – there&#x27;s almost no movement to this brush as it goes through your hair, making bad tangles more tangled if you don&#x27;t start at the bottom every time.  Now that I&#x27;ve seen the Bass brush, I prefer that...more give and not as much pull.</li>
    <li> I have always use the body shop hairbrush with metal pins but as they discontinued it, I have this one a try....I was very disappointed! It does not glide through my hair like the old one did at all. I am still looking for a hairbrush as good as my first one!!</li>
