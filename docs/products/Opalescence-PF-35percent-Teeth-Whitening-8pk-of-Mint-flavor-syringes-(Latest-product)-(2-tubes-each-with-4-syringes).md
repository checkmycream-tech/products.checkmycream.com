<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years with excellent results.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than same product sold by our local dentist.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I would caution anyone considering buying this product.  I followed the directions exactly as written., using 1/3 of a syringe. I had instant gum irritation, so I took the trays out of my mouth and tried to wipe off any excess product.  I put my trays back in and left the product on for only 20 minutes, because I couldn&#x27;t take the pain any longer.  My gums turned white as was mentioned as a possible side effect.  My teeth did appear to be whiter, but the pain and suffering I have  been experiencing for the past 2-1/2 days did not make it worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums are red, inflamed and bleed at times, at least I can eat today.  I would highly recommend using a much lesser strength.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Shipping was Fast&lt;br /&gt;*35% is potent and I saw a difference in one application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*If you get it on your gums it will cause a burning/stinging/bubbling sensation (it is peroxide after all)&lt;br /&gt;*It will temporarily bleach your gumline if you get too much on there&lt;br /&gt;*It will cause tooth sensitivity in some cases&lt;br /&gt;*Actually caused a blister on my wife&#x27;s gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;*Follow the directions and do not let it stay on longer than 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;*If you have a small brush (something like a nail polish brush) then paint the stuff on as to be more careful on getting any on the gumline (this also helps to not use as much product which gets you a couple of more uses out of it)&lt;br /&gt;*After you rinse the stuff off consider brushing your teeth again with something like SensoDyne toothpaste to help with the sensistivity issue</li>
    <li> My dentist stopped carrying Opalescence about 5 years ago. When he did carry it, he charged 70$ for the same type kit. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying whitener/bleach at the dentist when its so much cheaper here. I&#x27;ve had trays 15 years and haven&#x27;t bought whitener @ my dentist for 12 of them. I advise flossing really well prior to using this strength if you haven&#x27;t whitened in a while, if you don&#x27;t the gel won&#x27;t penetrate between your teeth and will be noticeable. This is a strong strength, so if your a first time user or are new to this strength buy some Sensodine toothpaste or you will feel sensitivity to hot/cold food drinks. Any questions feel free to ask!</li>
    <li> I HAVE PUT IT ON FOR 30 MINUTES AS INSTRUCTED AND I HAVE USED 4 SYRINGES BUT I DON&#x27;T SEE A DIFFERENCE. ALSO IT NEEDS BETTER/DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS. IT DOES NOT SAY HOW LONG TO WAIT AFTER THE TREATMENT TO EAT OR HOW LONG TO WAIT BETWEEN TREATMENT. THIS PRODUCT IS POORLY EXECUTED AS FAR AS TELLING A PERSON WHETHER THE RESULTS ARE IMMEDIATE OR GRADUAL AND THE INFORMATION I ALREADY MENTIONED.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  I used to buy it from my dentist and I am glad I can get it online now at a better price!!</li>
    <li> Way too strong. Really hurt my gums after just 20 minutes. I&#x27;ll stick with lower percent product.</li>
    <li> Since my wife started using it u where able to see the difference in a week and a half. She loves this product its cheaper than the dentist and u can do it while watching tv at night.</li>
    <li> Dentist must buy them here and mark them up 3 times! Same stuff...</li>
    <li> Bought them (the 35%) one week ago and use them once per day. Instructions say to use no more than 30 minutes, but I typically go for almost 50 minutes. There has been some MILD (hardly noticeable) sensitivity, but nothing that changes my eating/drinking habits. After 3 days use, I could notice subtle changes happening which were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;ve noticed no &#x27;burning of my gums&#x27; like most people complain about&lt;br /&gt;2. I can feel a SLIGHT fizzling which I used the product, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but I can tell its &#x27;doing something&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;3. VERY MILD sensitivity, but I keep using the product, it&#x27;&#x27;s not severe enough to stop&lt;br /&gt;4. The 8 pack seems like a large supply, I use a very tiny amount per session. (this should last a while)&lt;br /&gt;5. I spread the gel on my retainer and teeth with a Q-tip&lt;br /&gt;6. No expiration date, but I put in fridge to potentially extend shelf life&lt;br /&gt;7. Will definitely buy again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The directions say to use &#x27;1/3 to 1/2&#x27; of a syringe per use.....THAT&#x27;S CRAZY! You only need to use a fraction of that! Trust me, I use 1/10 per use if that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for $30.00!</li>
    <li> The product works well</li>
    <li> Works great!  Much better than any whitening you can buy at the store.  Highly recommend professional trays.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years now.</li>
    <li> Great product  Do not let the product go on your gums, you&#x27;ll be feeling some pain.  Otherwise great!</li>
    <li> Too strong, made my teeth hurt.  They work and I do have somewhat sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This was WAY to strong! It burned my gums. Definitely to strong for at home use.</li>
    <li> I bought this as refills for my trays; I originally used a lower strength of the same brand name. I thought this might work in a shorter time frame so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep the trays in overnight. Well--not only could I never keep this in my mouth overnight, I can barely tolerate it for five minutes. It burns my mouth a LOT, especially at the gum line. Torture. In fact, after just a few minutes, I found some spots on the gum line to be bleached out white. My own fault for ordering such a high strength. I might use this vendor again because the service was fast and complete, the price of the product was excellent...I guess they recoup some of that low cost with the high price of shipping.</li>
    <li> I was sold a product that expired two years ago! the proct had lost it effect. i have used 10% and 20% I know the effect when you use it. I was warned to be cautious using this by my dentist  it could burn my gums. no burning no whitening! no bubbling peroxide does when you use it. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS DISTRIBUTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Starting off, the price of the solution is great, but the Shipping is Outrageous for the fact that you spend 10 bucks to have them ship it in a small Bubble Mailer with a few stamps on it.    The actual product does what is supposed to do even though I can tell it is not a Fresh product.  Not surprising since it is on the internet and so cheap... As long as it does what it is supposed to do, that is all that matters to me.    The product is more effective than the 15 or 20% solution that you get at the Dentist.  Some say you can only leave it in for 30 minutes and that might be true for most.  I found that I was able to leave it in for 4-6 hours like the other strengths... the only thing is my teeth would be very sensitive for about a day and a half.  I believe I am only able to keep them in while I sleep because it is not a fresh product and thus the strength has probably diminished.  The results are really nice though... I still have a little more to go (the teeth around the gums are always the hardest to whiten) but I believe after 3-4 more applications I should be where I want to be.  then I don&#x27;t have to deal with the hyper-sensitive teeth.      All in all a good product and even though I am not impressed with the Seller, you cannot help but like the results. I just wish the dentist would have been up front and let me know that the 200 bucks I spent for the kit would not get me the results that I desired... and I would have to purchase more solution.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, working great!</li>
    <li> My only prior experience with teeth whitening was the Phillips Zoom! in office procedure with Night White take home trays. I had some EXTREME sensitivity after the Zoom! in office procedure so I was a little nervous to try  such a high concentration. I started with 20 minutes and worked my way up to 30. So far after four treatments I&#x27;ve only had some very mild sensitivity, but I&#x27;m definitely cautious. I&#x27;ve noticed improvements after only four treatments and plan on going up to seven. Just remember this is intended to be a refill of a product sold to you by a dentist, your dentist is supposed to be the one who gives you instruction on how to use it. This means the package instructions are very simple. If you&#x27;re new to this particular product as I was some online searching can be done to find basic guidelines and instructions. You also absolutely need custom fit trays to use this product, using it without custom trays is a recipe for disaster. I had mine left over from the Zoom! Night White take home kit and they work fine. Overall it&#x27;s a good product, it&#x27;s powerful so you must use caution and common sense but the results are great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fantastic (quick!) service</li>
    <li> This whitening works fantastic. Used it for two days  for 30 minutes and noticed a big difference in my teeth.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Works well.  Could be a higher rating if it were a little easier to apply - gels up a little.</li>
    <li> This came just as described and works very well.</li>
    <li> I have used other whiteners in the past, but this is the best!  I noticed results in just one time. I&#x27;ve used it for one month now,  aprox. 4 times and I feel like a movie star!</li>
    <li> I live in the hot southwest.  I suggest updating the shipping so the product doesn&#x27;t sit in a mailbox too long.  Heat is not good for dental bleach.  I used two syringes and when I got to the dentist for a new crown, my teeth were A1 white.</li>
    <li> The whitening gel hurt my gums and burns them until they turn white.  I have used the 35% for years, every few months, but this experience is completely different from what I have used in the past.  I am returning the product.</li>
    <li> For the price I would&#x27;ve paid at the dentist office I could get 3 of these from this seller versus 1 at my local dentist office.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this product at Amazon.com and at such an affordable price. I was buying it from a dentist and it was much more expensive. Keeps my teeth fresh and white for a healthy smile!</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome product!! I paid over $300  about 10 years ago to get trays at dentist and maybe 3syringes of gel. Not sure what brand it was. Then two years later when back to dentist to get gel 3 tubes $90 not sure of brand but disappointed. Two year ago went to dept store and bought gel for $5 it burnt my gum and did not lighten teeth at all. Got my product today from amazon and had to try it. I took before and after pictures sent  to friends and family amazing. Used half of tube and left in for an hour and half. One little spot on bottom  gum did sting a little and turned white for 30min. I never have written review but this product is amazing!! Thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I was paying $50 for TWO syringes at the dentists. UNREAL. I will always get it from here. Shipping is very high.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.  Contents fresh &amp; effective.  Delivery as promised.  Price is/was excellent.  I would certainly do business with them again.</li>
    <li> It works well. I am happy with it. I use the remineralization gel or my teeth are sensitive. My teeth are much whiter for having used this bleaching tel.</li>
    <li> Best teeth whitening out there.  I have molds made from a dentist that I use this product with. I put it on for about 25 minutes and can see the results immediately.  I do recommend keeping it in the fridge at all times unless you are putting it on; it looses it&#x27;s effectiveness as it sits in room temperature.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before with good whitening results but of a lower concentration. With the higher concentration, the printed information contains a miniscule warning not to leave the gel on the teeth and gums for more than 30 minutes (vs overnight being allowable with the lower concentrations.) It was several days of gum discomfort before the damaged gums healed to where I could chew food again. The very small Caution on the printed information clearly needs to be improved.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and ordered it direct from the company for a much larger price. Thanks to Amazon I can ordered it for much less.  These days every person watches the Dollar amount.   Sincerely, Hannelore Kernaghan</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! I&#x27;ve used it for 10 years and Amazon price is the best anywhere (dentist.net is double). It will burn your gums at the 35% so use it sparingly the first few times. Build up to longer time and then only problem may be tooth sensitivity after use. It&#x27;s worth every penny! No need to use with a dentist....just be smart!</li>
    <li> Bottom line, it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve tried that really whitened my teeth. Get good mouth trays, I got some decent ones and after the first go at whitening I got better ones. I got the gel on my gums, it burns, I pushed threw the pain for 30min and it burned my gums bad, like couldn&#x27;t brush my teeth for 3 days bad. But after getting better trays and not using as much gel ( I even tried painting it on my teeth like someone else said in their review ) I had no more gum problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the trays in for 30 min the first two times and had no tooth sensitivity. I normally have sensitive teeth anyway so I was happy about that. So I left the trays in for 2 hrs and only had slight sensitivity the next day or two but nothing too uncomfortable. I could still eat hot food and drink cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that did upset me was upon inspecting my order I noticed that there was more air bubbles in my gel syringes then gel. I have a friend that got the same product from his dentist and he showed me his syringes which didn&#x27;t have a single bubble in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was upset about this and called Amazon and they fully refunded my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Break down: it works, spend the extra couple bucks and get quality trays, careful with your gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all the other concentrations of this product and this is the best. Not only is it strong but it also does not make my teeth sensitive. The other lower doses used over long periods of time caused me tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Does a better job than the strips.</li>
    <li> DOes exactly as advertised.  But remember you need teeth trays and not to leave on longer than recommended</li>
    <li> Tried this product for a few days and found my teeth were very painful.There was a burning sensation in my gums and my teeth were sensitive for a few days after use.Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  My niece&#x27;s teeth are beautifully white.&lt;br /&gt;She loves this and we expect to buy more when she runs out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product......better then I purchased from the dentist. I started out using too much and irritated my gums so cut back on amount of product and was fine. I used at night while I slept as I had mouth guards made by the dentist. Three times a week for two weeks did it and now use once a week to maintain.</li>
    <li> This product is not for use at home. As soon as I put the gel in my dispenser and put the dispenser in my mouth, my gums began to burn and they turned white. I had to take it off immediatly and rinse my mouth repetedly and it took a day for the gums to stop hurting. I do not recommend this product for home use.</li>
    <li> Simply perfect!! Exactly what I wanted at a fraction of the cost!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not gonna bash it, but at the same time.... I honestly didn&#x27;t see any results. And after having to buy the mouthpiece separate I was out more money than I&#x27;d like to have been. But you live and you learn :-)</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than the stuff I got at my own dentist.  The only thing I would recommend is  starting out with less time first as it is stronger and your teeth can get sensitive. I tried this about three years ago when the stuff I got at my dentist was not only inconvenient to drive all the way there or wait till my next appt but it wasnt as strong and took so much longer to give me the result I wanted.</li>
    <li> It works quickly and comfortably.  You only need a little bit, so one tube lasts 2-3 applications.</li>
    <li> whitens teeth very well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products but this one by far is the best. After one treatment you can tell that it&#x27;s working but after the 2nd and 3rd treatment my teeth are so white, it only took 3 treatments and they are the whitest ever. Keep the leftover syringes it in the refrigerator until you need a touch-up they last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great buy, my dentist charges $50.00 per syringe, which is good for 1 entire mouth whitening. I got 8, that is a deal.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing, do not use overnight, this is quite strong. I use this once a month for 4 hours to keep up with the original&lt;br /&gt;dentist whitening. Once or twice a month is good to erase any red  wine, or any dark juices or food you may have exposed your&lt;br /&gt;teeth it will restore the shine. Don&#x27;t forget to use Relief ACP oral care gel after whitening to give your gums a rest.</li>
    <li> FIRST TIME USER OF THIS PRODUCT....WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN. NITE WHITE MUCH BETTER PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on my teeth, that&#x27;s how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I&#x27;d first gotten a whitening treatment from my dentist.  She also fitted me with hardened-gel trays into which I used the product she&#x27;d used, I believe it was BriteSmile.  It worked well enough.  But I decided to look for other products, and found Opalescence here.  Tried it, and -wow- an even more dramatic improvement.  I use it weekly for about an hour (put the trays in as I finish brushing in the morning and leave them in as I shower/shave/dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well this works with Opalescence&#x27;s own trays, since I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re fitted for your teeth.</li>
    <li> Item was shipped promptly and delivered as promised.  I received exactly what I was expecting to receive.  This is a refill from an original dentist purchase at a MUCH cheaper rate!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good to me!! I was afraid at 35% it would fry my gums, but no problem!! I was paying $35 for one four pack from the dentist and it was only 15%. You can&#x27;t go wrong here on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Works as good as higher priced product</li>
    <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t start out horribly stained, but this just brightens them noticeably. I wear a nightguard for grinding, so just put a little dab on my finger, swab it over my teeth (staying away from the gumline) and plunk the guard in overnight. I&#x27;ll do that for about three nights in a row, then my smile&#x27;s good and bright and white for a while. It actually works. I&#x27;ve been buying it for a few years now.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t beat the price. seems to be working as well as the overpriced once I get at the dentist. I have seen some complaints about expiration date but I have ordered this several times with no issues</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to use. Is the same as what my dentist used on me after my braces.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product to use for whitening your teeth...  I have been using Opalescence for sever years now, and will continue using this for the rest of my life!!!    I first started using this product when i got my braces off... (thanks mom &amp; dad for getting me braces)   Once i started i just couldn&#x27;t stop!!!  Not only does this product make you have \\&quot;MOVIE-STAR WHITENESS\\&quot;, but combine it with a perfectly straight smile, and everyone will thing that you have veneers..     And for me, I LOVE THAT kind of result/feeling!!!  (((I cant tell you how many times i have people comment on my teeth!!!  Maybe 30 ppl a week!!!!!!    ***A few things people need to know about using 35%.... or any other percentages.... ***    Gum sensitivity - Yes this product will cause pain should you put it on your gums.... (HELLO?!?!?!  This is made for your TEETH not your GUMS!!!)  If you have bleach on your gums it means that you put too much in your tray!!!  So you should immediately use a tissue and wipe all excess bleach OFF!!!     Most people put a lot because they want to whiten the tartar stains around the gum line...  You can achieve whitening that area by bleaching for 2-3 days, then go to your dentist and have them do a \\&quot;Hygiene/cleaning\\&quot; and then continue your bleaching process.  This will help break up the tartar so the Hygienist will be able to get more of the tartar off.  Thats my secret.  ;o)    Now like me, i tend to use 1 syringe for both top and bottom trays.  With a little left over for the next day application.  So with an 8 pack, you should have about 10 Applications.  You may have more depending how much you use.    Now, tooth sensitivity....   Yes, 35% will cause the most sensitivity..... Your better off with using the 20%!!!  A good thing to remember is that you should brush your teeth with a tooth sensitive tooth paste... Before and after your bleach!!! Not a whitening one!!! Dont over do it!!!    I believe Colgate has a new tooth sensitive one out...  I have not used this one but seems to be really good.  (I use armor-hamor advanced whitening)       *** If you like my review, or have any questions please feel free to contact me***  Remember keep on Smiling people!!!      PS.   I strongly recommend having professional whitening trays made!!!   Also, at 35% this is made for heavily stained teeth, and people that DO NOT have a problem with sensitivity!!!  I used this once..... And for me, i prefer the 20% ;o)     I dont smoke, drink coffee, or eat or drink highly acidic foods.  If you do, thats fine... Just know that once a month you may need to re-whiten your teeth.   One syringe will bring you back to your desired results.    Also, PROTECT YOUR TOOTH ENAMEL!!!!  This is what the bleach WHITENS!!!  If you destroy your enamel on your teeth, you will NEVER get it back, and or that \\&quot;MOVIE STAR WHITENESS\\&quot;  You will have more of an opaque white color, versus a solid one.  If you drink, a lot of wine, orange juice, soda, NEVER BRUSH AFTER HAVING ACIDIC food!!!!! Just rinse your mouth out with water and chew on Trident!!!  Its ADA accepted, and it also helps keep your teeth white!!!    If anyone works for trident, could you please give me a lifetime supply..... ((wink, wink))</li>
    <li> I ordered the gel and it seems to be expired or defective. These gels usually burn your gums if you apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;The gel from DENTAL USA do NOT burn. You can rub it all over your gums with no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted seller mutliple times. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER.&lt;br /&gt;I assumed they would send a replacement ASAP instead I am getting the run around.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Try not to overfill your tray because it really does burn your gums if you use too much.  I normally use about 1/2 a syringe per treatment.</li>
    <li> These whitening treatments work better than the lower % Opalescence I&#x27;ve tried. I tend to have sensitive teeth, and these do not bother them at all. Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I always purchased my teeth whitening gel from my dentist.  The dentist charged $35 per syringe.  Someone suggested that I look for it online.  I found it on Amazon and compared everything about the product looking for the difference.  It was the same as the dentist sold for a fraction of the price.  I&#x27;m sold on buying from Amazon in the future.</li>
    <li> Great results ! Works just as good as the stuff my Dentist charges me 95 bucks for ! It is the exact product my dentist uses and sells !</li>
    <li> I used this product before with success.  The price was great for the 8pk.  I have a tray that I&#x27;ve used before but actually found that I can put this product directly on my teeth and it stays because it&#x27;s somewhat sticky.  I leave it on for about 45 minutes - great for when you are watching TV at night - I&#x27;ve only used the first package and my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My dentist started me on it with custom fitted trays which im sure help to keep the gel in place. I have very sensitive teeth and this product does not affect them as long as I do not wear longer than the recommended time. I only need to use it about every 3-6 months, depending on how often I&#x27;m drinking products which affect teeth staining such as coffee or tea. My teeth whiten quickly with this product as well.</li>
    <li> great product, it is everything that it says it does, buy it you will love it and its great thanks</li>
    <li> The product came without instructions and also no expiration date printed on the carton. This type of product is time limited and the similar products I have used in the past, all had an expiration date printed on the packaging and recommended to refrigerate it.  So now I have no way to determine how fresh and effective the product really is. My teeth did get somewhat whiter, but not any better than with the Nite-White similar product I have used for many years.</li>
    <li> I was careful to follow the directions and found this effective and had no pain or sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Works well and faster than 15%. A little strong if using too much solution in trays. It can hurt or burn gums. I found the best way to use is to rub solution onto top and bottom teeth, inside and outside, and then put trays on over solutioned teeth. It does not run onto gums this way. My teeth are very happy!</li>
    <li> This product works well, but I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference from the original formula. I had sensitivity and it burned my gums a bit...but still whitened so I give it 4 stars!</li>
    <li> I feel like I was mislead in my purchase. The gel was advertised as 35% concentration, but I received a weaker 20% concentration. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> product was out of date, would have been a fair price if had not product been to old to work properly</li>
    <li> Tried several gel brand of whiteners with the same strength. My teeth were only sensative to these.  I tried 3 different times just to see if I could tolerate them.  I had to pass these on to some one else. If you have any sensativity at all, don&#x27;t try.</li>
    <li> Love this product, second time buying. Used to get this from my dentist at a much more expensive charge but since then I buy it here because of money savings. LOVE LOVE LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Some people will discover sensitivity because this whitening gel is a very strong and effective one, I do my best not to get it on my gums or else sometimes I do feel a small burning sensation for about a minute but this stuff is WORTH IT. I like to whiten my teeth every night for 2-3 weeks or every other night. You will see the best difference. This seller is heavenly.</li>
    <li> This is the exact same stuff I purchased from my dentist but at $175 cheaper. Save yourself some cash. Buy this stuff</li>
    <li> I love this product! My teeth look really white since i used it. I drink black coffee and it has got rid of any stains.</li>
    <li> OK, my teeth are whiter after using this product, but the whiteness doesn&#x27;t last. I think they all want your money, so you need to keep applying if you want results...</li>
    <li> Same product I paid much more for from the dental office.</li>
    <li> I have used this item from my dentist for years. However, it comes in lesser strength than 35%, so if you are really sensitive, try that one. I do find this product to be strong and hurt if I put too much product in the tray. So try to use the minimum, I assure you, your teeth will still whiten. When you press the tray to your teeth, you will see the product push up to the top of your teeth so anything coming out of the top of the tray should be wiped so you don&#x27;t have it sitting on your gums, which will hurt and cause irritation. I leave these on for about 30 minutes and I do it about once/month or once/two months. I know there is product to buy which helps with the pain/discomfort, however, you can also just rinse with Listerine afterwards which helps (also helps to rinse after you wipe the excess product off your gums if they hurt with tray still affixed to teeth). It is way more affordable via amazon, as stopping to the dentist just to pick this up isn&#x27;t convenient as well.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product at a reasonable price.  I will definitely order it again and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It really does whiten. But it can hurt - it makes your teeth achey and a little sensative.&lt;br /&gt;For whiter teeth its worth a little pain.  The cost is great too. Much cheaper than what the dentist had going for a deal and it worked better than the Dentists Office.</li>
    <li> Started using this product after having my teeth whitened.  Works very well for maintenance.  As a suggestion, rinse your mouth out with warm salt water.  Seems to help the teeth from being so sensitive after the procedure.  Got a fantastic price from Amazon vs. the dentist.</li>
    <li> Good product that you do not have to leave on for more than 1/2 hour.  Slowly whitens teeth over time with continued use.</li>
    <li> quick delivery and lower cost by almost 50%.  This is an excellent product and now it is affordable to keep the program going.</li>
    <li> Really works great.  Just do not over fill your trays or it will not feel good on your guns.  35% is high, 29% maybe better to start with. I do not overfill my trays and am careful with the gel.  Only leave in the 35% for 30 minutes.  It really works great.</li>
    <li> Works better than the whitening stuff that came with my sporting smiles kit and the tip is the correct diameter (small) for applying to the mouth piece. The sporting smiles one has a great big hole making it impossible to get the correct amount. Sporting smiles gel works but slower. The sporting smile kit is the greatest fits perfectly and does a good job but with this stuff it would do a great job.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. Less expensive than the whitener I get from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I have purchases the 20% in the past and was very pleases with the product. The 35% irritated my mouth, and did not seem to whiten as well, or any better. Will be sticking to the 20% in the same brand.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product only one star because I am disappointed in the whitening results I got after many applications. I have used the same strength of Opalescence successfully in the past. This product is thicker than in the syringes I&#x27;ve used in the past. There is no expiration date on the product, so no way to tell if the product is fresh or not.</li>
    <li> They were fast and efficient, No problems at all. The product was just as the ad shows, the price was fair.  I was happy with the purchase. Visit thewolfcomedy.com to hire a stand up comedian at your next event</li>
    <li> I wonder if the product sent to me is old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Opalescence is not whiting very well.  I do drink coffee and red wine occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for a different whitening system the next time I order.</li>
    <li> This is the product we sell in my office for 75$ for 4 syringes! This product is the absolute best I&#x27;ve found works amazing without the foaming up like other bleaching products. I absolutely recommend this product and will b purchasing all mine on here! They arrive on time or early and my order is always correct. I have ordered more than once and its always exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I have had professional teeth whitening before with zoom at a dentists office and in my opinion, if used properly, this product is just as effective (if not better). I have custom trays that I purchased from the  dentist. I used the suggested method of just putting a dab of gel on each tooth before placing the tray on. That method really helped to not get any of the gel on my gums. I love the product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the original strength I got from my doctor, it&#x27;s what I have always used, it gets the job done</li>
    <li> Overall a great product but very strong, my gums are very sensitive afterwords, will alter times for a better result</li>
    <li> Worked in just a couple of days for me.  Had a little chemical burn on my gums at first but after getting the hang of how much product to use, it didn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever if you only use for about one hour. Use very small amount, too, so it doesn&#x27;t burn the gums :)</li>
    <li> My dentist sells these for over $150. Got them for little to nothing. They are the same as the dentists&#x27;. They are awesome. Just get a mould of your teeth and purchase these and you will have the whitest teeth in the house.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read more reviews from this seller because I would have known that Green Dot was NOT worthy of my money. I initially received my first set of  35% from my dentist office and knew to expect the tingle on my gums. This set of syringes offered no sign of tingle, burn, etc. Hell....I&#x27;ll take the burning because I know they are working! Will be returning tomorrow and I hope I don&#x27;t get the runaround!!</li>
    <li> Working realy great, I love it. I used this gel for 2 weeks twice a day and now my tooth looks white. I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product and I followed the instructions precisely....  what I failed to do was take heed of the slight stinging I felt in my gums.  There was some very slight stinging around my gum line that started about 5 minutes into the treatment.  The stinging subsided at about the 15 minute mark, so I thought nothing more of it.  When the time was up and I removed the tray from my teeth, there was a white edge to my gums.  As first I thought it was the gel, but it did NOT wipe off.  Plus my gums hurt badly when I brushed my teeth after to get the gel off of them.  Thats when I realized my gums had been burned.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what chemicals are in this stuff, but it is HARSH on the gums!  If you are going to use it, be very careful about getting it on your gums.  I wont be using this product again and throwing the rest away.</li>
    <li> Works just like the stuff from the dentist!</li>
    <li> My dentist office tries to sell this stuff for an outrageous price.  When they told me how much theirs cost, I told them I was going to try and find the same thing online.  They just looked at me.  Now I know why!  Same exact stuff, for a fraction of the cost.  Works fabulous.</li>
    <li> Excellent price; however be very careful of the potency. It&#x27;s very strong and may burn the gums.  You may not be able to apply for more than 45 minutes at a time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t whiten. Not sure if it was old or just fake stuff. I did not see a difference at all!</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;3  a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> its easy to apply and works very well. i would recommend it to anyone. the 35% is the key i think</li>
    <li> I love the product! I&#x27;ve been using it for sometime now. The only problem I had was one of the syringes was not capped somehow, &amp; it leaked out all over, maybe from the heat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and live by it. Anyone who hasn&#x27;t used it (35%), don&#x27;t stay with this high. It&#x27;s harsh on the gums at times. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I get compliments on my white teeth. Love it!</li>
    <li> Mediocre product. Not what I was expecting the 35% to be.</li>
    <li> Strong but efficient :)</li>
    <li> Works well,very little irritation. I would recommend this product ,to anyone who wants an easy way to whitten at home. My dentist charges 200.00 for 4 pk of same product. I fell for it once!</li>
    <li> I have used Opalescence before, but this is the first time I have used  the 35% which whitens the teeth in 30 min. as opposed to 6 hrs.  the mint flavor is  much better.</li>
    <li> I did one application last night but was hesitant because i read reviews on how it burned peoples gums.  The burning didn&#x27;t last long and after one applications I already see HUGE results!</li>
    <li> This is sooooo strong it burns! Not sure about refunds so I will eat the cost and not buy again. Plus it is super gooey and is hard to get into the trays. As was the remineralization Gel Super gooey and comes out in globs. Yuck.</li>
    <li> The product does not seem as strong as what I have used before.I wonder if the product is outdated maybe.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package I was surprised how tiny the whitening gel tubes were. Big disappointment because it takes one full tube to whiten both the front and the back of the teeth. I&#x27;ve used other professional teeth whitening that allow you to have over 2 complete whitenings with a single tube. Although the whitening gel worked alright, it&#x27;s not worth the price for such small tubes. Looks can def be decieving.</li>
    <li> Great value.&lt;br /&gt;A lot cheaper than purchasing from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Used to get it at the dentist&#x27;s office.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for years.  This was half the price I pay at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> If you leaver this on too long and get too much on your gums it&#x27;ll actually burn them to the point that they blister and bleed. Be careful!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing.. I only used 2xs and my teeth are whiter than the veneers I just had put on and I could only go one shade whiter with those to be the whitest they have. Dentist didn&#x27;t recommend going that white. In hind site.. I would have said..do it anyhow. My bottoms are now whiter than my veneers.. no biggy..just proves the product is amazing. I ordered my trays from amazon as well. I would put them in at bedtime..and wake up a couple hours later.. to take the whitener out..and be done.. no pain or suffering. Our local area charges just over a hundred buck to get your teeth bleached per person.. I was able to get enough whitener and trays to do my entire family for under 50 bucks for an entire year. How can you go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Do not overfill your trays, its just a waste of product. More is not better in this case, not only are you wasting product but you will be getting more on your gums that will cause irritation.. I only irritated in the first application, and trust me it hurts.. Just put a thin coat at the base of the tray.. and I mean thin.. the product foams up anyhow so it will cover your teeth..and they will be all nice and white.. in NO TIME at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have never had my teeth whitened before and I seriously never thought they would be this white so fast.. This is the same product they would use in a dental office.</li>
    <li> The strength and quality didn&#x27;t appear to be like those I had ordered elsewhere.  Didn&#x27;t see whitening results like with other brands.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product to me, &amp; I can buy it much more cheaply from you!!!  Everythingf went very smoothly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other whitening products before with limited results. Since I already had custom trays, I decided to try a product that was stronger so that I could enjoy more immediate results. My teeth have always been yellowish, I do drink some coffee and red wines, etc, but do not smoke. So I was expecting my teeth to stay the same dingy color they&#x27;ve always been after I try to whiten (toothpastes don&#x27;t work and the weaker treatments don&#x27;t seem to do much either). So I thought perhaps something stronger would be better. Well, in that regard this stuff works pretty well. I can see results after 2 treatments... BUT... If it had come with instructions, I would have spared myself a day of agony from the ensuing sensitivity from leaving it on too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up the manufacter&#x27;s info - the 35% solution is recommended for 30 minutes a day. So my hour and half folly worked great - I really DID see a difference, but my lower teeth felt like they had ice picks jabbing through them. It went away after half a day or so, but it was not pleasant while I suffered through it. However, I am enjoying a whiter smile (my husband thinks I&#x27;m nuts, I smile at anything that reflects just to check out my \\&quot;new\\&quot; teeth). So I&#x27;ll keep using this, but ONLY for the 30 minutes instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if the instructions had been included I would probably give 5 starts for ease of use, lack of bad taste, no foaming or gum discoloration. The complete lack of any product information bothered me though. Hard to know how to use it, whom to contact with questions, or even the expiration dates for the syringes I have left. And a little goes a long way with this stuff - I&#x27;ve done two treatments and still have part of the first syringe left. I don&#x27;t see how I&#x27;ll ever get through the other 7 I have left at the rate I&#x27;m going. But I will have remarkably whiter teeth!</li>
    <li> Whiten rather slowly, and the stain removal doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get these, unfortunately they did not meet my expectations. They were not potent at all and could tell they were expired! No wonder the price was so great! Not a good product. If the person selling these had integrity and would sell something that was actually useful it would be worth it but it&#x27;s not. Maybe they will start selling something more up to date if enough people complain!</li>
    <li> awesome product. great results!!! i recommend this to anyone who would like to whiten their teeth..  it REALLY work!!! Love this product!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I strongly recommend it and you will love it too. I am very happy with it because its very good.</li>
    <li> Very strong. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I used this to the end and had NO improvement.  Did better with Colgate Optic White.  It was a waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this same stuff from my dentist for at least 4x the cost for the past few years. decided to see if I could get it cheaper online and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. works really great and I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but I bought it at the dentist for $100!! So I was very surprised and very HAPPY that I could get it on amazon for $30!! It works just as great as the one from the dentist and I believe this bleaching is the best for a good price!! I recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I used to get this product from my dentist at double or triple the online price!&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product and price. The pack I got was fresh, as it worked just fine&lt;br /&gt;for me. Delighted to find it at this price!</li>
    <li> Some of the syringe tops broke off, otherwise product was the same</li>
    <li> This was so strong and burning after not even 5 min...NO way could you use this overnight while sleeping</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to work okay, only complaint I have is the gel seems to be too dry and does not spread evenly over your teeth.  Would I  purchase it again.........we&#x27;ll see how the next 7 tubes go or should I say spread!!!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the quality of this product. I was about to go to the dentist for a teeth whitening until I ran into this product on amazon. I tried it and I will never go to the Dentist for whitening again. Remember, Opalescence 35% only stays in for 1/2 an hour, and you only use 1/2 a tube per time.</li>
    <li> Everytime I went to the dentist, I was paying $50 for two syringes!  Well, rob me no more.  I bought 4 for under $20 on Amazon and they work just as good.  Now that&#x27;s a reason to smile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Opalescence in the past, and it really whitened my teeth...like super white.&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s been a few years, and I thought I&#x27;d try it again.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem, is I must have used a lower strength syringe in the past, because these are extremely potent.&lt;br /&gt;I got some on my gums, and my gums burned solid white, then took a few days heal.&lt;br /&gt;So as long as you keep it off your gums, you&#x27;ll be OK, and your teeth will get white quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to go with 20% in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and it is a very good one.  When I received this item and opened 1 of the tubes, 2 of the plungers fell right off the end of the whitening gel.  Per my dentist and two of my professional hygienest, this is a tale tale sign that this gel is expired and no longer at its prime.&lt;br /&gt;Thus disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good! Made my teeth a little sensitive but not for long!</li>
    <li> this gel really whitens your teeth! I have custom made silicon trays and with this gel my teeth are several shades brighter! Only reason I took one start off is that sometimes I get too sensitive and my gum hurt after the treatment. I will keep buying forever.</li>
    <li> good price for this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper to order this online than to get it through your dentist.  It&#x27;s exactly the same product.  It does whiten teeth if you are consistent about it.  Like the 35% strength.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my gums or teeth.</li>
    <li> I was hoping they would work faster. They take time to notice real results, but my teeth were pretty white to begin with.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really whiten as well as the gel I&#x27;ve ordered in the past. Maybe I was supposed to refrigerate the other tubes until I w used them.  Maybe it&#x27;s a bad batch. I&#x27;d be cautious and they might be expired?</li>
    <li> would recommend this product for whitening. I just wished it was more easily available - such as over the counter.</li>
    <li> I have been using opalescence for years and love it. I only need to use it a few times a year to keep my teeth white.</li>
    <li> I used half a tube and applied it for about 25 minutes, and no results came of this tooth whitening product. What I did receive was the top layer of skin on my gums burned off. It first felt like pop rocks up against my gums, but I thought it being 35% strength some active chemical response was to be expected, but after I took off the mouth piece and washed my mouth out with water my gums were a weird looking white color. The next morning the top layer of skin on my gums was pealing off. I bought two 4 packs of this stuff, and it&#x27;s all going in the trash can. I know some people have different reactions to certain chemicals, but I honestly don&#x27;t believe anyone one else would have positive results from something this harsh.</li>
    <li> Caused burning lesions in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Tried several times but continued to cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;So no results t&lt;br /&gt;Due to short duration of treatment.</li>
    <li> This strength makes your gums sensitive.  Be careful when applying.  I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but it did whiten somewhat.</li>
    <li> Best way to keep your teeth whitened. Started with supply from the dentist, but the price here is unbeatable. Remember to store them in the fridge till you need a syringe, which has 2-3 applications per. Using with custom-made molds.</li>
    <li> I got the trays from getting whitening done at a dental office, and now I just order Opalescence to whiten my teeth a couple of times a year.  It works well.  Don&#x27;t expect 100% change/whitening, but to lighten/brighten your teeth a little, this works. And a good price.</li>
    <li> This stuff destroys my gums!! I can&#x27;t use it more than two days before my gums are are completely ruined.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  Really gets your teeth white quick.  I have tried other products, but this one works the best.</li>
    <li> Gets the pearly whites white! Follow the instructions to avoid sensitivity...Good product. Sent with expiration date of two years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Opalescence for several years. It works great and I receive lots of compliments on my white teeth and attractive smile.</li>
    <li> very good. patient love it</li>
    <li> not as irritating as some other gels I have used in the past - noticed a difference after 1 use.</li>
    <li> Fresh batch. Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this brand of whitener at my dentist and I was really pleased to find out that I could buy it online at a reduced price.  I like that this strength can be used for just a half an hour vs the type you have to leave on overnight.  It does a great job of getting my teeth white.  I have to watch how much I use on my bottom bleaching plate, however, because it does tend to irritate my gums but only for a short time. This is my second time purchasing this from Amazon and I&#x27;m sure that it will be my choice next time as well.</li>
    <li> for a 35% teeth whitener for this great price was a no brainer for me, the price was right and the product is fantastic</li>
    <li> The best part about opalescence?  NO FOAMING!    I&#x27;ve tried tons, TONS, of whitening gels, but I always come back to, and now will never leave, Opalescence!  All the others one&#x27;s claim to be higher percentages and maybe even a tad cheaper for more product, but trust me --- put Opalescence in your trays and just hang out for 30 mins or less (depending on the sensitivity of your teeth) and you won&#x27;t be constantly spitting out foaminess!    whatever you pay, it&#x27;s worth it........................ :-)</li>
    <li> Arrived quicly.  I&#x27;ve purchased this from my dentist before and it&#x27;s the same product except cheaper.Expires two years from now (a good thing).  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just received my Opalescence PF 35-percent today and can tell its the real deal. I&#x27;ve purchased other whitening gel from other companies and you could tell right away it didn&#x27;t work. I will re-order.</li>
    <li> One of the best teeth whitening gels out there. I was using the Venus pro white that was first given to me by my orthodontist. Once I ran out, I repurchased them a few more times but I was paying almost 30 dollars for four syringes. This product is equally as good and you get twice the number of syringes.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and a great product that truly works!</li>
    <li> A great product from UltaDent.</li>
    <li> I am unable to use these due to the 35% however my brother doesnt seem to be bothered by it at all.  And his teeth look great.  Very nice and white.  He is 65 years old so there ya go...</li>
    <li> Good whitening but harsh on the gums.  Overall I would say it&#x27;s sjomewhat better than other whiteners I have tried.</li>
    <li> The product works well just keep in mind that it is 35% and will cause extreme sensitivity.  I have used this exact product before which I received from a dentist office and the texture was very different, I believe the product was a little old but it still worked well.</li>
    <li> Great product for those that can&#x27;t sleep in their trays. It works much faster than lower percentages but even a small amount can burn your gums creating soreness for days. Personally, I prefer sleeping in my trays, managing the exact amount of bleach needed and the ability to more closely manage the amount of lightening I prefer to the exact shade I prefer.</li>
    <li> When my daughter told me that Amazon had the same whitening syringes for $3.66 each... two boxes of 4, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to order instead of paying $15 per syringe from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Please, get your trays made with a dentist and learn how to use the whitening syringes from your dentist FIRST!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use very much in the trays because the gel oxidizes as it whitens and if the 35% version gets on your gums, it WILL BURN!&lt;br /&gt;Remove the tray and clean off the gum line and the edge of the tray and reinsert.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe the reviews that says this is old product!&lt;br /&gt;It works exactly like the syringes from my dentist and is the same company.&lt;br /&gt;Remember, follow your dentist&#x27;s advice on time and use only a very thin trail in the trays.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both use one syringe between the two of us and it&#x27;s more than enough for one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the vials in the refrigerator!</li>
    <li> The Opalescence I use.. I had trays for my teeth made at the dentist. Found that this product is so cheaper on Amazon than from the dentist. I have had many compliments on how white my teeth are now from using this product. I will continue to order this product!</li>
    <li> This is the whitening to buy and with the long applicator tip you can control the amount you put in your trays so much better then the other brands I was using which was just the syringe. I was putting small dots of product in each tooth impression and I will have to say you should be careful on the amount you put in, I used about half a syringe (probably too much) and wow did it ever bubble lol I could feel it just a bit on my gums but I will adjust the amount I use in the future and it really wasn&#x27;t bad at all. I could notice a difference with just one application compared to 5 with the 22% (leaving on for an hour each application) I was using from my dentist.  I did the two day shipping and I had it next day.... Great product and incredible shipping, this will be what I use moving forward. Very happy. Also, the 22% I had been using made my teeth very sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t experience any using this. Again, very very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I can use the product but this product see stronger than my dentists 35%. I do like the mint flavor</li>
    <li> My dentist started me on it.  They were going to charge much more for one syringe when I got eight plus the toothpaste for about the same price.  Very satisfied and told my daughter about them.</li>
    <li> I bought 1 single syringe of 20% at the dentist for $11.00, didnt like wearing the trays overnight. Found this stronger product (same brand as what i bought at dentist) on amazon and way cheaper. It works great only had to wear the trays 30 min, saw much whiter teeth after first use. Some slight increase in sensitivity and be careful not to get it on your gums. Loved it and will buy it again when needed.</li>
    <li> The 35% gel by Opalescence is made by Ultradent Corp. It was designed for prescription use by dentists only. Now the company has decided to offer it to everyone. That would be fine, except that this product will burn / no make that scorch / the gums, inside of cheek, and other soft tissues of the mouth if it touches them for more than a few seconds. PLEASE talk to your dentist before trying this product on your own. My personal advice would be to use no more than the 15 or 20% gel that Opalescence makes. And even those gels must be used in special, custom made, bleaching trays that your dentist can make for you. Some products, like the 35% gel, are just too harsh to be released for public use. After enough people sue Ultradent because they are badly burned . . . the company will sell only the less powerful bleaching gels. Ultradent has a reputation as a fine dental company. I am very surprised that they have put profit above public safety.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will.  It is very strong.  I noticed results after my first use.  I only used it for thirty minutes, and I was in pain.  I am used to the 14% for one hour so based on other reviews, used it for 30 minutes only.  I used it twice a week for three weeks.  I was still sensitive to it after three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern was the sensitivity I had the day after.  I generally use this product before bed while I am cleaning up the house and getting ready for bed.  The entire next day (at least until dinner time), my teeth were very sensitive, even to air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again because the price is amazing, but I prefer the lower strength because of the sensitivity.  If you need a quick brighten and can handle not having ice cold drinks the next day, this is exactly what you need!!</li>
    <li> Opalescence 35% is the quickest, best teeth whitener I&#x27;ve ever tried. Caution: It&#x27;s very strong and will burn your gums. I however have been using this product for years ( with professional bleaching trays from my dentist) and was first introduced to the (10%) product via my dentist. My gums have now become accustomed to the strength (35%), so no more discomfort!. 30 min to an hour and at times overnight, for quick, next day results. I keep mine refrigerated in a pouch, I received from my very first order. Gel seems to last longer this way.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal. I even shared it with dentist. I have already ordered it twice and will do it again real soon!</li>
    <li> I have tried many whitening products and so far this is my favorite.  I like the fact that you only have to leave it on for 30 minutes and I had no irritation whatsoever.  It actually whitened my teeth to my desired whiteness in only three applications initially, then once a week usage thereafter keeps them perfect.</li>
    <li> The end result was not good.  I had used another brand previously that I really liked but I decided to use the Opalescence because it was a better price but I was disappointed in the product.  I am going back to my old brand!</li>
    <li> Wife and I went from A2 to B1. Works great</li>
    <li> See picture I posted for where to find expiration date.  Product works great when refrigerated and fresh.  Dry teeth prior to placing tray with ointment on it.  There are bubbles in each little syringe.. that is normal.  The syringes from my dentist had bubbles.</li>
    <li> The same as what I have been paying dentist $25.00 for each and here I got 8 for $36.00!!</li>
    <li> I used this before and everyone who ever knew hardly recognizes me with my beautiful white smile now!  It took me time and of course I laid down and got all lived up with a movie before remaining still for an hour or two.  My teeth with absolutely horrid BEFORE.  Now they look just amazing.  Took me a few weeks.  When my teeth/gums were too senstive I waited till I could psyche myself up again and it was SO WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> I first got custom whitening trays about fourteen years ago - right after I had my braces removed.  I have used just about every gel from several dentists.  All of the gels have been far less than 35% and of course took a lot longer per treatment (usually overnight) and many more treatments than this product at 35%.  And the gels cost SEVERAL times more from a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can achieve the same results as this 35% product, but it will take much longer, and will cost much more.  There is a balance between the percentage of carbamide peroxide and gum irritation, however - and it varies from person to person (the irritation, that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here is what I have found.  If I floss my teeth once a day and brush them two to three times a day and use a fluoride rinse \\&quot;Act\\&quot; at night,  I can use the Opalescence 35% for one hour per treatment in custom trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after one hour, I can see clear results.  If my teeth are still too \\&quot;dim\\&quot; I can use it every day until I get the results I want.  I know (sort of) if I have over done it because my dentist will tell me my teeth are \\&quot;too\\&quot; white and off his colour chart.  I never tell him this, but I think his teeth are dim and stained.  (Sorry if that is mean.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips:  Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.  Floss once a day and use Act fluoride rinse at night and use THIS gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is the best I have tried.  It works quickly.  Short treatment, few treatments.  If you cannot tolerate an hour; use the recommended half hour.  I don&#x27;t have sensitivity, but if you do, switch to \\&quot;Sensodine\\&quot; sensitive teeth toothpaste and use the Opalescence less frequently, for a shorter time or both.  Also, stop doing those shots of straight Bourbon, because that compounds the irritation to your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I vacillate about how often to touch up my teeth - so I asked another Amazon reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that is what works for me and I hope this helps you.  A bright smile makes an awesome first impression.  And second, third...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,  Danbright smile makes an awesome first impression.  And second, third...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,  Dan</li>
    <li> I think this works very well. You do need to have trays from your dentist to get the best benefits from this. This is much cheaper than the cost at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> great product lives up to its expectations would recommend and would buy again easy to use and store definitely must have</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Better than sitting at the dentist the get the job done. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the results and the price!</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging. Was I wasting hours wearing the trays with the product that may have expired ?&lt;br /&gt;Well, there&#x27;s an expiration date after all, except it&#x27;s not very obvious. I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product lines).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expiration date is indicated as \\&quot;ZMMY\\&quot;, where Z is a product lot letter, MM is the month and Y is the year. For example, A055 would mean an expiration date of May 2015.&lt;br /&gt;So look closely on your syringe for these characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those who complained about the lack of instructions, well- they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact). ultradent.com/en-us/Product Instruction Documents/Opalescence Tooth Whitening.pdf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular, it says-&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Wear Opalescence 10% for 8-10 hours&lt;br /&gt;or overnight, Opalescence 15% for 4-6 hours, Opalescence&lt;br /&gt;20% for 2-4 hours, and Opalescence 35% for 30 minutes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keep on smiling with your (hopefully brighter) smiles !</li>
    <li> I read the reviews that were talking about expired product, or no expiration date on the packaging and I was a bit concerned. I went ahead and ordered it anyway. I have no idea if it&#x27;s 35% or a less potent concentration, i have no way of knowing ,  but it worked. First time I used it, I loaded my trays with 3/4 of  one syringe and left them on for 15 min. It burned my gums and there was no difference at all on my teeth. Second time i used about half syringe for both trays and left them on for 30 minutes. No burning, no discomfort and there was some whitening but I was not amazed. Third time 1/2 syringe for both trays, left them on for one hour and what a difference! Repeated the same thing for the next two times and my teeth are as white as they can be! So more product doesn&#x27;t mean faster results, it will burn your gums! Use just enough and keep the trays longer. I also used Sensodyne toothpaste and brushed my teeth before and after bleaching, I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues at all!</li>
    <li> Too strong and causes pain to the gum lines. I should have purchased a less potent package and next time &amp;#34;IF&amp;#34; I use this product I will get a lower strength.</li>
    <li> fast shipping.............gel was very fresh and very potent. I get 35% gel at my dentist office and it has never worked as well as this pack did. I know heat and too much cold affects the potency of the product so I was a little worried because delivery trucks in Florida can get very hot; but I had no problems.</li>
    <li> There are already many reviews about this product with a lot of information. I simply wanted to add that this stuff will whiten your teeth but it will also make a mess out of your gums. I whitened two days ago and my gums are still red, irritated and look like they have been chewed up and scratched up. If you have sensitive gums only use this product every few days. Don&#x27;t do it two or three days in a row; otherwise you will be in major pain, and your gums will look like they have been eaten away by acid.</li>
    <li> They work well, a bit strong but I like this so I don&#x27;t have to keep them in for a long time.  Takes a number of uses.  My wife always steals them.  The caps work but do tend to fall off.  They now have instructions which is nice, previous orders didn&#x27;t come with instructions.  Basically the same stuff the dentist sells but for less money.  They can cause sensitivity and slight burning.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter but I think that they should be more white than they are. I have one more tube to use, when I&#x27;m done with that I will let you know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hygienist and should of known better when I ordered such a high concentration. Definitely hurt the teeth after the first use. Luckily I had topical fluoride to help with the pain. I will not order these again. Best to go 20% or lower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Dr.songs and other products, and I feel that this product is the best! You can see it working in just a couple uses. RYAN.</li>
    <li> This works really, really well and at this strength only takes 35 minutes!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but the 35% was too strong for me. The 35% irritated my gums. The 10% worked better for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal much cheaper than the dentist office charges. This is my second order, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Love the flavor and works as expected</li>
    <li> Great Deal for a Great product</li>
    <li> Quite strong. I left mine in for 15 minutes and burned my gums.  Use cautiously!</li>
    <li> Good product but does not provide long term results. Sometimes syringes don&#x27;t do anything. Then I try another syringe and its powerful</li>
    <li> I originally searched out a product used by my dentist; and then I found this. Now, this is all I consider buying. Love it! No more harsh burns, and beautiful white teeth.</li>
    <li> The seller is a scammer.  It says &amp;#34;latest product&amp;#34;  I have been whitening my teeth with 35% for five years now.  The product was so stale, it didn&#x27;t work AT ALL.  I slept with my own custom trays in...with no results whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I think you need to get rid of that seller.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from another source - like the company itself.</li>
    <li> This is great.  My teeth are already looking whiter.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped it fast and I feel the price was&lt;br /&gt;very fair!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this tooth whitener several times now and really its wonderful. As I already said use it wisely otherwise or it will burn the gums but its works well and delivers the desired results with astounding results. Great!</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery.  This product works!</li>
    <li> I have ordered the same product from other sites before. What struck me as strange was that there was no plastic wrap or expiration date. And when I used it (I&#x27;ve been using 35% for many many years) I could tell it was not that potent and I did not get the same results that I got when I bought it from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this order from Amazon came in the origin wrapping WITH instructions and guaranteed freshness. I feel much better about that. It sure beats $15 a tube from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI, I would NOT use this if you haven&#x27;t had custom trays made professionally from your dentist. And I would start with a lower peroxide % until you practice applying it. It&#x27;s an art. I believe 35% is the highest potentcy and it will burn your gums off (literally) and leave big white burn marks on your gums that take weeks to heal if you don&#x27;t apply it to the trays correctly. Especially if you wear them at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of dentists give a free whitening kit (including customer trays) to new customers. They&#x27;ll as show you how to use them. As you get more proficient, then I would increase the % if you like.</li>
    <li> It worked great but I did burn my gums the first time I used it. Make sure not to put too much gel into your trays.</li>
    <li> I was on a hunch trying to find a great whitener , and i will stand by this after trying all those other strips and gels but this one is the TRUTH !! my teeth are so beautiful along with the toothpaste, i received both the next  and they work absolutely great as a team , i am so happy!!</li>
    <li> I used to buy the regular syringes all the time and I loved it but I can&#x27;t find it any more so I got these PF ones which are supposed to prevent people from burning their gums during whitening. I don&#x27;t know who these morons are who burned their gums up to prevent the regular formula from being sold but I&#x27;m not happy about it. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. The old stuff worked great, I always saw a difference when I was done. I used this several times in a row and there was no change at all. I even switched to different syringes. They had not expired, they are just garbage. Don&#x27;t waste your money with this product.</li>
    <li> 35% teeth Whitening, one&#x27;s should  not expect miracle.  It does what it claims and it is easy to use and you should use retainer with it to hold the gel</li>
    <li> I was so excited when ordering it cause i read all the reviews. Once i tried it omg it hurt!!!  i would not recommend this to anyone! dont waste your money!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. This product seems very old and somewhat dry. I willnstay clear if this individual product and try another supplier.</li>
    <li> I think it is too strong both my daughter and used the product and had burning of the gums. She used it for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Several of the tubes were opened! They don&#x27;t open themselves that means the product was repackaged.</li>
    <li> I am a teeth whitening addict and I have to say this is the best so far that I have come across. It actually is the stuff my dentist uses to professionally whiten his patients teeth. and for the price YOU CANT PASS THIS UP. be careful with the % though with sensitivity bc it really does hurt when directions are not followed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Opalescence whitening products for a couple of years - I used Crest white strips before. I definitely recommend Opalescence because it works quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave teeth feeling as sensitive.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t use alot very stronge</li>
    <li> 35% really burns the gums but left on for a shorter time makes it better. I will order the 20% in the future.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this system. However, when I received the package 4 of the 8 tubes were missing!</li>
    <li> This is a stronger solution that acts quickly and seems to work fairly well.  I can see a visible difference after 30 minutes and don&#x27;t have to wear the dental tray overnight.  Results last for a while. I prefer using it to over the counter dental whitening strips that don&#x27;t really produce much of a result.</li>
    <li> Great product for anyone with strong healthy gums.</li>
    <li> Did not work!  These were a scam!  Do not every purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I threw them away I was so angry.</li>
    <li> Dentist quality product for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product and delivery time.</li>
    <li> Fast and reliable! I suggest everyone!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product by my dentist.... Who I trust completely.... He made the custom trays for me, which were very expensive, well over $500.00, but they fit great and really enhance the whitening process..... I was given a years supply of Opalescence with my trays, 20% strength.... I used them as directed, once a day for 2 hours or overnight for 2 weeks.... The sensitivity and pain was almost unbearable, but I wanted whiter teeth so I stuck it out.... Awesome results but the sensitivity lasted for almost a week after I stopped the process... I am currently in the middle of a 2 week whitening and have found very little sensitivity this time.... I&#x27;m not sure if the gel has past it&#x27;s prime or I&#x27;m just less sensitive this time... I whiten once a year and touch up for one or two sessions only when needed.... So the only complaint I have is that I was not told to refrigerate my gel as is suggested on [...] and that I don&#x27;t see an expiration date on the syringes or the packaging.... My teeth seem to be whitening, but I&#x27;m just not sure if I&#x27;m getting the full benefit....  I highly recommend this product and hope they continue to offer it here on www.Amazon.com because my dentist sells it for $10.00 per syringe... here on amazon with my prime membership I get it for about $3.40 per syringe..... Huge savings for the same exact product..... Happy Whitening!!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and matched the description provided by the seller. Some customers mentioned the lack of directions that accompanied there order on how to apply to bleaching. My order came with directions and they are easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product worked well on my teeth, however I did experience noticeable sensitivity. 35% is the highest dosages you can purchase for whiting your teeth. The directions that accompanied the product state specifically to only use to bleaching for 30 minutes. One day while I was bleaching I lost track of time and experience a burning sensation on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to be bleaching your teeth, I suggest you start brushing your teeth with a toothpaste such as sensodyne in preparation for your bleaching. Continue to use the toothpaste while bleaching. This will reduce the sensitivity while bleaching. Always remember that sensitivity can vary from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27; am very happy with the product and the results.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a very good product when I purchased the teeth whitening from this distributer but for some reason it DOES NOT WORK!&lt;br /&gt;Usually within one hour having the product on you will see a difference but I had to apply 3 times per week for one hour each apply and even though I did not see any difference. Don&#x27;t think that I have a very bad yellow teeth. it&#x27;s not the case. It&#x27;s just the fact that this isn&#x27;t the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the product has been old and they are still selling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product from this seller, go straight to the Opalescence website and save your time and money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
    <li> I should have gotten no more that 20% instead of 35%. Way too string, I got sores in my mouth.  I have used 10% before&lt;br /&gt;and it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times, so this is simply a re-order of the whitener sold me by my dentist. Happily, the price is far lower when ordering here.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and will whiten the teeth within an hour. I use this once a week and I feel and look like I have been to the dentist for cleaning and whitening.</li>
    <li> Have you priced these vials of teeth whitening solution at the dentist? This item is exactly the same gel, at about one-third the price. Opalescence 35 is very effective in whitening teeth grown dark with coffee and age. I experienced NO sensitivity from use on my teeth, although others reported uncomfortable sensitivity. Bonus: My wife says it&#x27;s nice to see light reflected from my mouth when I smile, which makes me smile even more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff from my dentist for years.  For some reason, I thought it was only available from a dentist.  Then it occurred to me to look on Amazon, and here it was for less than half what my dentist was charging me!  This stuff works great and fast.  It&#x27;s strong, so don&#x27;t leave it on more than half an hour.  Two weeks of daily use, and my teeth are good for months with occasional touch-ups.  Very happy, and will order only from Amazon from now on!</li>
    <li> I have trays from my dentist office, this product is very hard to use syringe and put a dot in the tray and does not evenly distribute therefore causing it to burn my gum. Very unhappy customer.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used this brand for twenty? years. Wow. I prefer the 20% now that my teeth are older. The 35% produces way too much sensitivity. I use sensitivity toothpaste before bleaching, it helps.</li>
    <li> This stuff is exactly what my wife and I needed to keep our teeth in great shape. I have every intention to ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> Product works as expected.  Just be very careful that you do not overload your tray or you will burn your gums. A great price compared to purchasing at your dental office.</li>
    <li> Product is easy to use just follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt; Applying treatment: I applied a small amount( about the size of a tiny bead or drop) on every tooth imprint of my custom teeth mold ( or whatever that is I had a guard made for me through my dentist) and put them on.&lt;br /&gt;During treatmen: I felt pain on certain parts of my gums within seconds. The discomfort initially is pretty bad, it will subside quite a bit with time, so hang in there! Wipe off excess solution from your gums if necessary, I was salivating a lot so I kept spitting, I didn&#x27;t want that stuff in my mouth...the discomfort got better ad time went on, so I made it through :)&lt;br /&gt;Outcome: WAY WHITER TEETH! YEAAA!! my gums were white in some places but soon went back to pink. My gums do hurt a bit and are very sensitive, I suggest you get a soft tooth brush for brushing your teeth, you will need it until your gums get back to normal. My teeth are sensitive to cold and heat. My tongue is sensitive as well, no hot sauce  for a while. boo.&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: Excellent product! Excellent whitening power! Worth the temporary discomfort!!</li>
    <li> Good product...be careful not to leave on too long...use with a molded mouthpiece</li>
    <li> Its what my dentist uses - only cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Does the job</li>
    <li> ive used this in the past from my dentist but in the melon flavor. I ordered mint and it has a much better taste. It was much cheaper than thru the dentist and was delivered within just a couple days. works great. Thanks</li>
    <li> works great every time! been using this for years, but now paying way less than at my dentist office... i drink lots of coffee and tea, so i like to touch up every few months.. must follow directions, if you do, there should be no problem... if i start to feel sensitivity (which is not too bad, not painfull) i will use sensidine toothpaste for a few days, and skip application for a few days then go back no problem... not all teeth are the same, so obviously this might not work for everyone.. if you notice discomfort stop using and always ask you&#x27;re dentist if you&#x27;re teeth are healthy enough to try  whitening..</li>
    <li> Tore my mouth up.  I have used whitener that I purchased from my dentist and put in pre-made trays with no problem.  I thought I would save some money using these.  I did purchase the 35% and that is way too strong.  After about 2 hours I woke up with damaged gums. i ended up throwing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great value and superb product. I highly recommend it + being 35% strength shortens time to have trays in - a big bonus.</li>
    <li> Like you, I read the reviews and STILL purchased the 35% solution.  I work in the dental field and thought I knew better and could handle it.  I&#x27;ve used it once and am a little gun-shy to try again! LOL  It&#x27;s an excellent product but like the reviews state, it is very strong.  I got a couple gum abrasions from filling my tray too much.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you do NOT gob the material on.  It takes a max of 1/3 of one tube per treatment!  Place about 3/4 of the way down into the mouth tray.  Wipe away ALL excess material.&lt;br /&gt;By the time I realized I used too much it was &amp;#34;shoulda-coulda-woulda&amp;#34; and hello burnt gums!  Nothing serious just a lot of redness.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it, be careful....however, I would start using the weaker solution of 15%.</li>
    <li> Superb product.  I used one-day shipping with the 35%, and it arrived promptly and very potent. I notice the whitening immediately and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one warning - don&#x27;t use more than once a day or once every few days.  Give your gums time to heal from this harsh stuff and DON&#x27;T push yourself, otherwise you&#x27;ll be in pain for a least a week (ask me how I know . . .)</li>
    <li> They are way too strong. Your teeth will hurt if you put too much. Make sure not to use it over 4 or 5 hours</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t have to worry about purchasing an expired product.  whitening is perfect. i keep the unused portion in the refrigerator to extend the life of the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years! Always bought it from my dentist. Same name brand, Same strength, different content in this pack! Did not work! DO NOT BUY from the seller! I&#x27;m mad i bought an 8pk of worthless product. I had to go buy it again from my Dentist and as usual, that worked Effectively!</li>
    <li> Dentists charge much more for this product than Amazon with a much lesser percentage of the active ingredient. This is a great bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Though the Opalescence Teeth Whitening gel did a great job of whitening, it burned my gums and actually caused some gum recession.  This just can&#x27;t be good for your gums, especially long term.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth bleach. I had gotten it from my dentist in the past and spent way to much money for it. It is a great value for the price and works great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product recently from Green Dot thinking that I would receive a real, fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received from Green Dot was not fresh at all. First, it had no expiration date. My dentist pointed that out to me when I brought it to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one and a half syringes already, and nothing happened. My teeth are the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase from Green Dot! I have purchased this product again, however from a different seller.</li>
    <li> This whitening works...trust me.Just make sure if you have sensitivity to use a tooth paste that relieves that.Also I saw results within the first week</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, despite applying a Vaseline barrier, a bunch of the gel got into my gums and turner the area between my front teeth white in under 5 minutes. It burned like crazy, which is why I went to check. Please avoid this product and use it under your dentist&#x27;s supervision. I am wishing I had.</li>
    <li> Great product. Whitens very well just be carefull not to get on gums as will burn. Many dentist won&#x27;t sell you the 35% since it can irritate and sometimes very bad. They will only do in office. Great product and great price on Amazom!</li>
    <li> This product works great and the consistency of the gel is perfect.The gel doesn&#x27;t overlap and get on your gums if applied correctly.</li>
    <li> Okay everyone, this product is legit...AND THE STEAL OF THE CENTURY!  I just got my gels yesterday and today my teeth are already much whiter.  ONE TREATMENT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and I have used this Opalescence PF 35% for years.  We usually pay $20 a tube from our family dentist.  I figured I would give this Amazon listed product a try since there is hardly anything to lose if it turned out to be fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS NOT FAKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in the same packaging that you would get from your local dentist.  It works EXACTLY like the stuff you get from your dentist.  I have almost TWO YEARS before the product expires.  They label the syringes with an expiration date sticker, however if you look closely on the syringes they show a 4-digit &amp;#34;ZMMY&amp;#34; date printed by the manufacturer.  This stands for Z&#x3D; lot number  MM&#x3D; month of expiration and Y&#x3D; year of expiration.  My syringes of gel were coded E096 which is interpreted to: Lot E, expiring in 09/2016 (which is also exactly what their sticker read).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier that I discovered this on Amazon.  I will continue to buy from this company time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those reviewers complaining that this product was painful and burned their gums: it&#x27;s simple, you need to keep it off your gums!  Even the stuff you get from the dentist will burn your gums up, but you&#x27;ll pay a lot more buying it from them.  Just apply the gel in your trays and wipe of the excess with a Q-tip or tissue immediately to prevent the burning.</li>
    <li> i tried to upgrade from those given my dentist, however this is powerful be very careful not to applied too much!... might cause irratation to gums</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use because it made me gag, but my wife used it and had excellent results. would use again. recommended</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work. I did not see a difference .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave on more than 30 minutes.  It will start to burn and temporarily bleach your gums! :)  Otherwise great product.  You&#x27;ll see results fast.</li>
    <li> Great product and worth the price....this item costs hundreds if purchased by a dental office. It was a great deal, just wish teeth trays were included. It was kind of difficult for me to find them.</li>
    <li> Works excellent if you follow instructions! Cut out coffee, tea, soda and any staining foods and use daily for huge improvements in just 5 days or so!</li>
    <li> Bought it because the dentist was charging me almost double the price.  Works great!  It&#x27;ll take at least two weeks before seeing results.  After about two-month later, my teeth are white as rice.</li>
    <li> Fast turnaround and everything in tip-top condition.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works great! I also used the melon flavored and it tastes better but 35% works faster and you don&#x27;t have to wear as long.</li>
    <li> Only have been able to use once but it really seemed to work better than the 20% I got from my dentist, which didn&#x27;t seem to whiten at all.  I will try again later after my current dental work is done.</li>
    <li> I am a dental assistant, this stuff work wonders. I would like to know the exp date.I feel these has lost some power. mabey exsposed to heat in travel from mailing. Best kept in cool settings or fridge at all time to last longer and stay at full strength. On the flip side, fast shipping. My teeth did look whiter with one 2 hr use.I put into fridge to preserve. This is profession grade teeth bleaching gel. It is strong and will whiten your teeth many shades.It Will make your teeth a little sensitive I believe. Great price. Great seller!Exellent product.</li>
    <li> I did the in office treatment and was able to handle 3x20 minute sessions so they felt I could handle the 35% to take home and I have had few problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, this WILL burn the snot out of your gums if you get the product on your gums. Do not use too much, a little goes a long way. Each syringe lasts me 4 to 5 applications and I still occasionally get some gum burning from the product seeping onto my gums. I&#x27;ve toughed out the gum burning more than once. The first time was very upsetting because I took the trays off and the areas of my gums that were burning were very white. Do not panic if this happens to you, it will go away in a half hour or less, but it will make your gums extremely sensitive to brushing for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the professional mold trays made and you will use a lot less product. Use small dots of product on each of the front teeth of your tray. I rarely bleach my back teeth, nobody really sees them anyway.</li>
    <li> The order came quickly, and it is not a knock-off . I would give 5 stars if it had a legitimate expiration date. Without it I can only give 1 star, because as far as I am concerned no expiration date means it is expired . If the company wishes to contact me, feel free to do so.</li>
    <li> Love this whitening gel works great and whitens my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Teeth were very white after three overnight applications.</li>
    <li> This product does indeed work, BUT (and many people don&#x27;t want to accept this), YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meaning, few if any people will see any results in one or two or even maybe 10 sessions. YOU HAVE TO PUT THE TIME IN AND DEDICATE many sessions to this. Nothing (besides veneers or snap-on smiles) works overnight, even if you hear other people say this. True everybody and everybody&#x27;s teeth are all different cases. I have been using this 1-2 times a week (15 to 30 mins a piece) since Thanksgiving day. My teeth were far from bad, but also not like the teeth you see on commercials or news anchors (all of them use snap-on smiles or have had veneers). I have seen GOOD improvements, but again, I am not where I still want to be. YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - it is NORMAL to get a tiny bit of gel on your gums, even with the best fitting trays. Nothing out there is 100% precise apple pie. A tingleing senseation is normal and is tolerable, and goes away in a few seconds, or a minute or so. Do not get discouraged and just give up because you feel a bit of tingleing. A tiny bit on your gums will not hurt or destroy your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get at the dentist (zoom cleanings) do not produce much better results than say 5-10 sessions of doing it this way. Sure you are in and out in under 2 hours, but, you will spend upwards of $400-$500 dollars - much of that is profit for the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also normal for saliva to get into the trays (especially the bottom trays, as naturally, that is where your tongue is). Don&#x27;t let this discourage you. Your mouth is gonna produce saliva naturally, and if you innocently swallow as normal, this will not hurt you. Trust me I am still alive and well 3 months later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I recommend. You HAVE to put the time in, though. If you give up after 1 or 2 tries, your reviews and experience will be inaccurate!</li>
    <li> My wife is happy so I&#x27;m happy. All kidding aside, the product is as good as the one she was paying twice as much for. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used before with success if done properly .  Tedious way to bleach</li>
    <li> This stuff works and the price is so much cheaper than my dentist office!  I will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work wonderfully for me and irritated my gums a lot --my gums turned white and very tender, staying that way for at east 12 hours.</li>
    <li> Item as described i bought these from my denmtist and it cost me a lot more then what i paid on Amazon. This is an awesome product and im extremely happy.</li>
    <li> Caused pain the day after usage!</li>
    <li> Opalescence PF 35% is the most effective teeth whitening solution I have ever used. After reaching the whiteness I desired, I now do a maintenance touch up once a month for 30 minutes and my teeth stay nice and bright white. I receive many compliments about my smile, especially how pretty and white my teeth look. I had bleach trays made professionally in the dentist&#x27;s office. I just put a drop of beaching solution in the front of each tooth indentation in the tray and then place the trays over my teeth for the 30 minutes. I clean the trays with my toothbrush after each use. A dentist first sold me this product in his office about 8 years ago but Amazon&#x27;s prices are so much better.</li>
    <li> Im Surprised That People Are Using So Much Product In Their Plates. My Dentist Directed Me To Add A Small dot To Every Tooth Indentation On MY Plates And Wear Fur 30 miN. I Have Sensitive Teeth So I Am Sensitive For A little Over A Day. My Dentist Recommended For Two Weeks Then A Monthly maintenance. With The 35% I Use Every Two Days For About 2 Weeks Plus Monthly maintenance. My syringes Cost Me $20 Each At the Dentist, SoThis Is A Bargain! No Teeth Whiteners Should Be Worn for Hours Or Overnights!</li>
    <li> Like most people, I purchased opalescence directly from my dentist at a crazy expensive price. The upscale of things are that at least I have the recommended custom molded tray for my teeth so I achieve maximum results. I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROCESS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE:&lt;br /&gt; My teeth were about 2 shades lighter than corn yellow when I started. About 1 1/2 months later I achieved the whiteness I was looking for. It wasn&#x27;t like the crazy white that most movie stars that glows in the dark and shines violet under a black-light. I managed to achieve about a \\&quot;natural offwhite\\&quot; white that&#x27;s still pretty white in comparison to most people that doesn&#x27;t look too fake like veneers or snap on smiles but still pretty obvious that I have invested in taking care of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE:&lt;br /&gt;I used it about initially at least 5 times a week for the first two - three weeks and then gradually reduced to about 1-3 times a week. After about 3 months from when I began the product I only applied once every other month and then gradually to once every 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;I started about May 2011 and ended around August 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a 12 pack of the Opalescence PF 20%  Melon flavored from my dentist and this 12 pack lasted all this time with even some syringes left over! I left it on for about 20-30 minutes and my dentist taught me a little secret&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER INITIAL USE:&lt;br /&gt;I just re-bought this product and I&#x27;m looking forward to increasing my whiteness. My whiteness to this day is only about a shade or two darker than what it was since my last use in August and is slightly duller. That&#x27;s about 8 months of discontinuous use and my teeth are still looking great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;You need one little drop on each tooth and that&#x27;s all it takes! Also you should refrigerate them so the syringes can remain fresh and last longer. Hence why I believe some people have received faulty syringes or have syringes that no longer work well. ALWAYS REFRIGERATE THE SYRINGES BUT DO NOT FREEZE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have patience with the product and don&#x27;t overuse it! for the PF 35% and 20% I do NOT recommend sleeping with it but rather leave it in no more than 30 min to 1 hour. Maximum recommended time to leave in is about 2 hours. Sleeping with this may increase the whiteness but your teeth will be weak and sensitive, therefore to retain your teeth&#x27;s strength and not make them super sensitive and painful DO NOT LEAVE THIS IN FOR MORE THAN 2 HOURS.&lt;br /&gt;with the PF 15% and 10% You can leave it longer than a few hours. but no more than 4-6 is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all the turtle wins the race against the hare. Be smart with this product so you can gain the long lasting results it promises and you will be happy. Try to speed things up and I assure you, you will be in a world of pain and misery</li>
    <li> Same thing my dentist recommends but much cheaper.  Thank you, Amazaon.com!</li>
    <li> This product does amazing job of whitening your teeth at a reasonable price. You just have to have retainers made by your dentist so it fits your teeth perfectly because if this product gets on your gums, it will burn and cause bleeding and it can be fairly painful experience. I had my teeth professionally (Zoom!) whiten in the dentist&#x27;s office two years ago and I got my retainers made then so I just use them with this product instead of ordering it through dental office as it is very expensive. I would say that this product removes surface to medium depth stains but I doubt it can remove deep stains at this strength and without blue light so just be realistic with your expectations. However, this product is stronger than any whitening strip or paste you will find over the counter so proceed with caution. Make sure it doesn&#x27;t end on your gums, and leaving it over 30 mins will certainly cause major &amp;#34;zits&amp;#34; pain and teeth sensitivity especially if you eat/drink acidic food like diary and certain fruits.  Also, just like after professional whitening, your teeth pore will be open up to 48 hrs after the treatment which increase the risk of staining. Make sure you avoid food/drinks that has strong dyes such us coffee, berries, teas, curry, etc. If you experience some sensitivity and pain, don&#x27;t panic. It is totally normal and will go away in a few days. Over the counter tylenol can help relieve some of the symptoms.</li>
    <li> I do not have to have this stuff on my teeth for a long period of time to get an awesome bleach...be careful not to get this on your gums though~</li>
    <li> To me it is weaker than what I get from the dentist. it is identical and has same percentage of whitening.  I am going to keep using it to see if i get better results over time.</li>
    <li> I have used several teeth whiteners before, but this is the worst! It causes unbearable burning to my gum line to the point that the gum line looks like it has receded. It is blood red and causes mouth soreness.  It also causes a CONSTANT INTENSE PAIN within my teeth themselves that can last up to 48 hours (no exaggeration). It keeps me awake at night and I am constantly aware of the pain throughout my day LONG after taking the trays out. I&#x27;ve never had this experience with products I&#x27;ve used in the past (which unfortunately are no longer available and is why I tried this product in the first place). I have a high tolerance to pain, but this is ridiculous. And, it gets my teeth nowhere near as white as prior products I&#x27;ve used. I also do not get anywhere near the uses from each tube of this stuff as I did the others. I&#x27;m not sure a lesser strength in this brand would really help or not and personally, I am too gun shy to even try it. Will definitely find another product to try.</li>
    <li> I saw the differnce within 2-3 days excellent product would recommend to anyone looking to whiten their teeth pricing is good also</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and I knew going into this that this product would be uncomfortable, but I was willing to endure it to have a nice white smile again. For me, 15 minutes a day is all I could stand before the sharp nerve pain was too much, but the pain did not carry on throughout the day. when I used the strips, I had raw nerves for 2 days and was miserable. with this product, I have pain when I use it, but not afterwards...strange? I thought so, but the product works and so far I am happy with it</li>
    <li> This product cleans and whitens my teeth beautifully! I just keep it on for no more than a half hour. This is just as good if not more performing than the one from my dentist. Please get this product! You will not regret it!!!</li>
    <li> Whitens fast than the white strips.  Gel can sting a little, so you must be careful not to dispense too much into trays.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with results.</li>
    <li> That product made my gums very sore and tender.  It is too strong.  I will not buy it again.  goodbye</li>
    <li> Not so great I used this product with its tooth paste and I saw no change for the better in fact it gave my teeth a yellow hue.</li>
    <li> It makes your job easier, you can apply it work, without anyone notices it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just beware from putting more than suggested, or longer than instructed, it may give you sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This product does work but it just doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as stated on the package.  The vials are rather small.  Holds less product than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I like it fine.  No problem. I would recommend it to anyone needing a whitener for teeth.  Thanks for the recommendation.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviews warning about potentially old and therefore weakened product. There is no date of expiration anywhere on any of the packaging or product which is suspect. For 35% this stuff really doesn&#x27;t  seem strong. I have left it on my teeth for over and hour and have had little sensitivity issues which isn&#x27;t normally the case. As far as its efficacy I used crest white stripes immediately before starting this regiment so I really can&#x27;t tell if this product actually made a difference.</li>
    <li> I maintain my teeth colr with this product. It lasts a very long time. I am a coffee drinker and this product keeps my teeth looking great for a very long time. Once I got the whiteness level I wanted it is so easy to keep them that way. GREAT product !</li>
    <li> Super great product, got at the dentist the first time so they would make the plastic mouth plates now I buy the refills online.</li>
    <li> I had ordered the 20% before and liked it, but the 35% works faster.  I will order again when I run out of this.</li>
    <li> This is just like the ones that you buy at the Dentist office.  But much cheaper and easily available online.</li>
    <li> Works fantastically, but make 100% sure you do not get any on your gums. I had red, ultra tender and mildly blistered gums - it took a week for them to settle down and get back to normal.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love that each treatment only takes a half hour.</li>
    <li> This product will whiten your teeth. The first time I used this, I loaded my trays, the way I usually do, with another product I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I burned my gums. It was extremely uncomfortable, but if you remove the gel from your gums it will stop. This gel is much stronger than anything I&#x27;ve used before. Instead of loading the trays, I now paint the gel on my teeth very carefully, being sure not to come close to my gums. Even doing it this way, I sometimes have to take off the tray and wipe product away from my gums if I feel burning. I barely use 1/4 of the tube now for one treatment, and the results are fantastic. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as I anticipated.</li>
    <li> I had to return the syringes. The product doesn&#x27;t work like the ones you would buy from your dentist. I don&#x27;t understand why this happens? Is this product not stored properly at their warehouse?</li>
    <li> terrific product!&lt;br /&gt;will last a long time in fridge for when you don&#x27;t need it&lt;br /&gt;worth it</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works great!</li>
    <li> Great price - used before so know the degree of effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Best results ever from at home whiteing</li>
    <li> Pretty intense and burns A LOT. Make sure you work up to 35% slowly. Ouch!</li>
    <li> My dentist was selling this but I can get it cheaper on Amazon.  The cost is still like buying ounces of gold, but it does work for me.  Beyond the price, my biggest gripe is how sticky the stuff is.  That&#x27;s good for sticking to the teeth, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have custom made whitening trays so they match my teeth exactly.  To clean out the used whitener, I have to soak them for quite a while in cool water.  (Cold seem to work better than warm) This helps remove some gel, then I brush them out with a soft toothbrush.  Then I dry as much as I can inside with a soft paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I use q-tips to swab out each tooth mold and let them sit on a paper towel to dry completely (being very careful not to toss them out accidentally as I sadly did with a night guard - custom teeth appliances are also like gold) the molds virtually disappear on a white towel.  The gel is clear, the molds are translucent, so it can be very hard to be sure all the old gel is out and THE MOLD IS COMPLETELY DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last is emphasized, because if they aren&#x27;t clean and totally dry inside each tooth molding, you will have a devil of a time getting a blob off the applicator to stick into the spaces.  I learned all this over a couple years of using it, so I know my method is working now.  I&#x27;m just adding all that as a possible help to others using this whitener who might be having the problems I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s whitening experience is different.  I have to use it 10 days in a row initially and then every few days to renew.  I don&#x27;t have movie star teeth and they yellow quickly from eating anything, but this stuff gets them as white as possible without any sensitivity or any problems at all.  I even leave it on for 30 minutes usually.  I guess if there is a long term drawback to using it, I&#x27;ll add an edit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this whitening product for at least 5 years.  I would not use another if given the choice</li>
    <li> This product is amazing</li>
    <li> I see a big difference in the whiteness of my teeth after only three days.  Actually saw a difference after the first day.  Checked out some videos on youtube for visual on the best way to apply this product.  BTW, went to my dentist to have molds made specifically for teeth whitening.  That is the best way to do it!!</li>
    <li> BRILLIANT A**********</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff my orthodontist sold me to whiten my teeth and the price on Amazon is about half what I paid my doctor for this.  It really works at whitening your teeth.  You need retainers to put it in.  If you have those from having orthodontia on your teeth, then you just put a few drops of this in the retainers and leave them on about 15 minutes.  Works great.</li>
    <li> It seemed to be inconsistent. The tubes that worked worked very well and you could feel the strength as it was working. Other tubes simply felt like Vaseline on my teeth with no results. But I will say the tubes that did  work worked very very well</li>
    <li> I have used the Opalescence 22% Whitening and very much like it. The results were very good. I wanted to experince the 35% for even better results, however, it was too strong for me. My gums were too sensitive to the strength...I was disappointed! I would recommend it to those who can tolerate the strength. I am sure it gives great results!</li>
    <li> These are the same ones I use to buy from my Dentist but these are almost half the price as what my dentist charges. One of the best brands I have ever tried for whitening my teeth and it really whitens them a lot.</li>
    <li> This product works really good, better than the 20%, you can leave it on for shorter period of time (half hour) and have the same results for the 20% for 2 hours.  Not an every day product because of tooth sensitivity, but a couple times a week to keep a bright smile!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple years now.  Its much cheaper to buy it here than through the dentist.</li>
    <li> I used this bleach and it burned my gums so badly for severly days after I applied it on my teeth. I NEVER noticed a difference with my teeth whitening.  My husband also used this product and he had the same issues with his gums hurting and no difference with his teeth whitening either.  I would NOT recommend this product at all, it does NOT work.</li>
    <li> This is a very strong product. I cannot imagine anyone keeping the gel on their teeth for more than 15 or 20 minutes. Be very cautious, as it will burn your gum tissue if it gets on there.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth super white! Make sure you don&#x27;t put too much in your tray. A little went on to the gums and irritated it. Just put some Vaseline there and it will be fine.</li>
    <li> Bought my first opalescence at my dentist office. The price was much higher than Amazon. It whitens your teeth excellent. You see results after only a couple days. The omly thing I find that bothers me is the fact I do have to re-use it more often than I thought, once I reach the whitness I&#x27;m happy with. May be the fact I don&#x27;t brush during the day enough. I would suggest a lower % than starting with 35%. I worked my way up &amp; now fine with it, no gum sensitivity. Really love it and will continue purchasing it from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have bleached my teeth with DENTIST grade products for almost 20 years. Thinking I would skip an office visit and cut corners and buy directly, I chose this product to use. It ate the skin off my gums. Then, sure, my teeth looked whiter. As most bleaching products will - within 2 DAYS my teeth turned as dingy yellow as I had ever had in the last 20 years. IDK if this stuff damaged my enamel permanently but they will be hearing from me if it had. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you value your gums and your teeth!!!</li>
    <li> I am on my second syringe after 1.5 week of daily bleaching for 30 min each night.  I can already tell that my teeth have whitened and my friends have also noticed.  I have used once in the tanning bed and the effects of that was amazing.  It works faster with the UV rays I imagine.  My dentist recommended this and I love it.  To keep from having tooth sensitivity, use sensitive toothpaste before and after you bleach.</li>
    <li> Teeth are whiter with one application</li>
    <li> my best friend is a hygenist and use to give me this stuff...I was so glad to find it and I KNOW this stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;results are within a couple times of use.&lt;br /&gt;I have true teeth whitening trays she did at the office, but I see Amazon offers a send away kit to do your own custom&lt;br /&gt;teeth whitening tray... I totally recommend doing that because the basic tray (like a mouth guard) does not fit all mouths or teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I myself have an overbite and not perfect teeth, so getting a custom tray is the best way to get the best results.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. It is extremely hard on the enamel of your teeth. If a little of it happens to get on&lt;br /&gt;your gum, it irritates it. I bought the 35percent strength.</li>
    <li> Very good service and nice price on product</li>
    <li> I to pay nearly double this price at my dental office for the same product.  This will help keep your teeth sparkling white.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that works well. You really cannot beat the price considering what they would charge for this at a Dentist office. (I&#x27;m a dental assistant) For anyone having problems with sensitivity - This is the HIGHEST concentration of the formula, it is meant to be used for a shorter amount of time (30 min max) and yes it hurts! If you find you are having too much sensitivity you can try a lower concentration and use for a longer period of time.......or you can go to the drugstore a buy a tube of Sensodyne, use the toothpaste in place of your regular toothpaste for a few days (i.e. while your waiting for you product to ship) and viola problem solved! The more you use the toothpaste the better it will work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and it works quite well. This order was for resupply and I haven&#x27;t started using any of the whitener from this order.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after the first use! The only problem I had was that my gums were burning really bad and they were sore afterwards. I think I just put too much in the tray and it overflowed, but I&#x27;ve been too afraid to try it again. But the gel lasts a long time if you keep them refrigerated, so with the long shelf life and the low price I still think it was a great buy! Beats another trip to the dentist.</li>
    <li> I bought these this past year and didn&#x27;t use them until about two months ago.  The first pack worked as they have always worked for me.  The second pack, however, did nothing.  I don&#x27;t know if they had been opened and air managed to ruin the gel or if the gel had been replaced with something else.  I have used Opalescence for years and believe it to be a good product.  I won&#x27;t buy it from GreenDot sales through Amazon again though.</li>
    <li> I had used a 10% before and worked fine just a little slow.  The 35% was too strong and irritated my gums.  I had to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t burn or whiten teeth. Was an utter anticlimax. I recommend you Skip this and try something else .</li>
    <li> Definitely met my expectations in spite of the reviews. I took a chance and it worked out. The key to minimize the discomfort is to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get on the gums. A tiny dot helps to concentrate it specifically on the tooth.</li>
    <li> I originally got the Venus Pro 22% from my dentist with trays made in his office. I like the process so much but could not afford the price of $50 for 3 refills. This has the same exact product in the tube but at a 35% concentration. It is a little harder on the gums if it seeps on to them so be sure to use it sparingly. I know it is powerful from the stinging of the overflow that happened one time. It is powerful, it works just as good as the Venus and you get triple the product for half the retail cost.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery.  I would highly recommend.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I learned about this product while I was sitting in the dentist chair.  I LOVE IT!  You can see a difference in your teeth after the very first time of use.  Now the best part regarding Opalescence PF 35 % being available to you on Amazon for purchase is that a dentist tends to offer the same product but it has a lower whitening solution.  This means that you may have to leave the whitening tray in your mouth for an hour or two and some people even try to wear it in bed.  THIS Opalescence PF 35% is a QUICK THIRTY MINUTE treatment.  I had my mouth tray molded at the dentist office so I am not sure about the tray that is provided. Yes I would definitely recommend.  What are you waiting for?  It is time to smile!</li>
    <li> I went to my dental visit and they sell these for $70 for a kit of 4 syringes, so this is a great price.  They are easy to use, just don&#x27;t get the gel on your gums, it&#x27;s like a chemical burn if you do.  I was told to just put a dot of gel in my mouth piece for each tooth. So be careful and wipe off any excess gel.  I have sensitive teeth so I&#x27;ve been using it for 30 to 45 minutes a day until I get the white that I&#x27;m looking for as recommended by my hygienist.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in the ratings above, I haven&#x27;t used the recenty purchased product will soon. It is made by the same corporation, Opalescence and I expect it will be the same quality. I know there have been ratings and reviews by others who have purchased the higher concentration and there have been complaints about burning sensations on the gums both upper and lower. I will follow the instructions carefully and see how it works for me.</li>
    <li> The product is dated. I&#x27;ve ordered through them before and it worked but not this time. I&#x27;ll change to another supplier in the future. Too many competitors offering a quality product to put up with this.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums. So the first treatment didn&#x27;t hurt, but the second time I used it my gums were sore for a few days. I have custom appliances so my gum exposure is minimal. Works well to whiten.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Exact same stuff I got from my dentist. It was fresh and did a great job!</li>
    <li> I should have taken the other reviews to heart.  The 35% is very strong, and burns your gums quite badly if you get any of the gel on them.  I would recommend going with a smaller % to avoid the likely discomfort.  Overall, it worked well.</li>
    <li> I got this from my dentist a few years ago and I believe I paid over $100 so I decided to check on line.  Boy, can&#x27;t beat the price!  I have read the reviews and for the most part, if this is the same product, it worked great for me.  Yes, it is sensitive to your gums.  Be sure to only put a LITTLE in the trays. I am ordering it now and am looking forward to receiving it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist. It works beautifully!</li>
    <li> item is 35% peroxide. yet, really no tingle or sensitivity,after an hour or so of use. this leads me to believe it is outdated product. wont buy again.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product. I have spent up to $75.00 purchasing Brite White from my dentist and I received better results from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, it is very strong and I could only leave it on for 30 minutes which was perfect.</li>
    <li> a little stronger than I thought it would be.  Price is great and I just have to be careful. I do use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Works fast and easy to use if you have the molds</li>
    <li> great stuff. now my teeth are extremely white.</li>
    <li> Good product for great price. Will late a long time.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEE MY OPALECENCE</li>
    <li> works great will buy again</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and as advertised</li>
    <li> The bracelets were not effective for my joint problems.  The Opalescence 35% was much too strong.  I found that I could only leave the product on for about 15 minutes at a time as it was very abrasive to my gums and made my teeth extra sensitive.</li>
    <li> For a teeth whitening product this one is outstanding.  Easy to apply, convenient to use, tastes good too!  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This truly whitens your teeth.  The best whitener I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to everyone.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is entirely too strong.. burns.</li>
    <li> These are the EXACT brand my dentist carries and for $40.00 you get three times as much. MORE than enough to last you YEARS. Or you can split the cost with someone.</li>
    <li> I will always order this product at this price.  Exactly what I got from the dentist for $80!  This is a great find.</li>
    <li> I filled a tray and put it in my mouth. My lips swelled up for a day &amp; a half! I don&#x27;t know what is in it but I couldn&#x27;t be shire it was just Opalescence! I had used 20% before with no problems. I wish I could return it!</li>
    <li> I hesitantly bought this product with pretty low expectations...as I was used to paying $50+ at the dentist for only 2 tubes. I was surprized to see how well the product worked and I love the price. I will be reordering again.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have been using opalescence since introduced to it by my wonderful dentist years ago.  I am a wine and tea drinker and am over 55 but my teeth don&#x27;t show it!!</li>
    <li> This product really gets your teeth white.  Beware if leave on too long your gums will become over sensitive.  I only wish the price was more reasonable.</li>
    <li> Love opalescence....my dentist originally had me use this years ago only he would charge me a fortune for it!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this as she had gotten it from her dentist to whiten her teeth before her wedding.  I purchased these and, even though I followed the directions, I saw no change from using the product.  Maybe the potency / strength is weaker since I wasn&#x27;t purchasing it from a medical professional, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the money or effort.</li>
    <li> This works fine and I have no problems or complaints... it is worth the price and does have the mint which makes the process more pleasant</li>
    <li> Love this product. Got my trays and a few starter syringes from my dentist. He wanted $35. for a pack that was 20%. I did not see much difference after using it. Then I saw the 35% here. Much cheaper and works very well. My teeth are not sensitive to it. Noticeably whitens them and the price is great! Getting the trays from the dentist make them more form fitting. I would recommend getting the custom trays from your dentist.</li>
    <li> small tubes and not as good as the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these a few times now, for myself and my teenagers. Now I just need to convince my husband to use them! I have been very pleased with the results. I ALWAYS follow up with the remineralization gel (very important. If you are unsure look at the online scientific testing done on the softness of whitened teeth with and without the remineralization gels - its a no brainer!) But here is the important part that I discovered...SOME toothpastes (used prior to the whitening gel) cause bubbling and painful gums and extreme sensitivity during whitening IF the toothpaste is not rinsed off VERY thoroughly before using the gel!&lt;br /&gt;I see at least one reviewer mentioning that this gel doesnt work because it doesnt bubble up! Its not supposed to!!! That is a reaction between the gel and the toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am not sure what toothpaste that I used to use now, but the bubbling didnt occur if I rinsed a number of times before application. Now I am using a toothpaste that doesnt contain SLS (sodium lauryl sulphate) as I discovered that I am sensitive to that. I cant tell you if that is the difference but I NEVER get bubbling anymore when using the gel and the gel DOES whiten my teeth significantly!!! Please, purchase the remineralization gel too (available from a number of sellers last I checked) because it is VERY important to follow up with this to strengthen your teeth after bleaching (and reduces sensitivity) !!!! I bleach for a week or 10 days every 12-18months and have been doing this for years now! By the way, I have the custom made trays. This makes a huge difference as it creates better fit and therefore contact between the gels, and protects your gums!</li>
    <li> works very good product, used 3 times and see the results, be careful with burning gums, applied with fingers on each tooth, do it fast or burn your fingers</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t really tell if my teeth were that much whiter.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy.Shipped quickly. Very easy to use with your tray.Seems to do the job and I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product was introduced by doctor and it really whitens the teeth.  Teeth trays are needed for use of this.</li>
    <li> does the job it is intended to do. great packaging. be sure to follow instructions. I would buy this again</li>
    <li> The product is really well and work perfect after few days you can see the white denture and it is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love being able to use for a shorter length of time &amp; get great results. The gel does turn your gums white and cause sensitivity if it gets off your teeth, so be careful not to use too much, or wipe off your gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never disappointed. Works great. Lasts a long time in the refrigerator, up to a year.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much! P.S so much cheaper than a dentist....</li>
    <li> I have been a dental assistant for over 30 years and have used the opalescence brand before and really liked it. Does a great job in whitening your teeth!!</li>
    <li> The product does a good job, but I don&#x27;t like that the little tubes don&#x27;t have caps on them</li>
    <li> Just at the dentist and they wanted twice what I paid for here! Got the newest version of Opalescence PF 35%. Amazing results in just one app and then 2nd one told me I don&#x27;t need to do anymore.  Beware of sensitivity of teeth and gums.  It progressed through out the day and into evening but I took it like a man ( I&#x27;m a woman).  I was told &amp;#34; suffer to look pretty&amp;#34; but never listened ever!  Give me the gas at the Dentist office please........even for the cleaning!  Gums do turn white at edges but back to normal in less than an hour. The Reviews helped my decision a lot that is why I am doing one myself. Really great but it does feel uncomfortable so beware of that.</li>
    <li> This product is strong &amp; efficient. Using a q-tip &amp; Vaseline on the gums helps reduce irritation in case the product accidentally gets on your gums.</li>
    <li> Exact same whitener my dentist sells ....my dentist charges 3x as much!!!</li>
    <li> Does a good job of whitening. Better than whitening toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Works well, use only small amount, 3 to 4 sets of trays per syringe. Keep off gums!</li>
    <li> The dental professional will eat your wallet ..... buying on line through Amazon was a real treat !!  Great price  and a trusted product !!!  GREAT results as indicated !!!  Only for those who desire truly great brillance of whiter teeth !!  : )  : )</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after using just 1 tube. Only thing is, if it gets on your gums, it is bothersome at the time while the trays are in your mouth.</li>
    <li> It works somewhat, but but with very little effect. I have tried 35% before and this does not look to be fresh since the strength appears to have diminished considerably. I have tray made by dentist and followed the instructions to the letter.</li>
    <li> burned my gums like hell..... didn&#x27;t lighten my teeth at all. eventually, i gave in and made a trip to a dentist to have my teeth whitened 2+ shades</li>
    <li> Awesome! Same exact product my husband bought from his dentist!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  It must be stored properly at the warehouse AND when it&#x27;s shipped.  Leave on for 30 mins.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product from the dentist and the cost is much higher. I feel these work to some degree, but not completely sure about how much improvement. I would say it&#x27;s worth a try. People have various levels of need and this may be just what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Great buy, price went from the last purchase but it&#x27;s still a great deal!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully - only has to stay on 30 minutes, have recommended to many friends.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers noted, this product burns your gums. I found it difficult to apply it in my teeth whitening trays (I have 2 sets that were custom molded to my mouth) without getting some of the paste on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Where it touches the gums, it burns it (ouch!) and turns the tissue white. If some of it finds its way down your gullet, which may be unavoidable, what effect does it have on your internal organs? I wonder...&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable whitening effect after 2 applications, and I left it on for 45 minutes. My teeth are pretty white to begin with, though.</li>
    <li> they are the best whitening gel you can get. I been purchasing these for years now.</li>
    <li> The best whitening gel I have ever used. Excellant price, excellant product, I sleep with my trays in and opalescence works extremely well. I like my teeth blindingly white, so I use this product more frequently than it would normally be used. I get compliments, and notice people looking at my teeth when I smile and when I&#x27;m talking. Like all whitening gels (and I have tried quite a few) sensitivity can occur. If you experience sensitivity simply take some ibuprofen that day, sensitivity will subside within 24hrs. It&#x27;s a small sacrifice for having a great smile and white teeth.</li>
    <li> I used all 8 syringes and saw no results. However, i went to the opalescence site and read that it can take anywhere from 1 session to 6 months for the product to be effective. I purchased another order and still no result after another 8 syringes. I finally caved and tried Crest white strips Glamorous White, and saw results in the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the expiration date on the syringes I received in the male and it said they were still valid, but I&#x27;m going to assume that they got spoiled by not keeping them stored at the proper temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used professional whiteners from the orthodontist and dentist and this gives the same, if not better, results! I love this. With any other whitening gels your gums (if you use too much of the gel in the trays!) and teeth will have sensitivity, that is normal. I have always gotten compliments on my white teeth and still continue to using this product!! I have recommended to many many people!</li>
    <li> I really like the brand Opalescence!  I never have teeth sensitivity, it whitens my teeth very well, and the flavor is good!</li>
    <li> Works as well as whitening in a spa or dental office. Really easy to use and not abrasive like some are.</li>
    <li> I have been using teeth whitening products(20%) for over 15 years and have never had a problem till I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this product, as it badly irritated my gums for about a week the first time I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempted to use this a second time and my gums were on fire within minutes and had to stop the procedure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After contacting them about this problem they seem to have very little concern for customer service or making their customers happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I never received my initial order from them and it was like trying to pull teeth to get them to ship my order again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would stay away from this company!  This is the first time I have ever had to write a negative review of a product sols by amazon.</li>
    <li> Really think it is good; kind of thrown by how small an amt. in each syringe, but there are 8 so I guess it evens out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used teeth whitened for years. This time I used it for weeks with no real improvement. Find a different distributor.</li>
    <li> A recommended product. You have to be extra careful because of the strength! My teeth required 7 applications. Use a very small bead of gel in each tray section (don&#x27;t waste gel on crowns or caps- &#x27;it is what it is&#x27;) and only leave on for the 30 min! (Better to apply more applications as needed and skip a day or two in-between applications if too sensitive). Using vaseline to coat the gum line worked well my second time around...I used too much gel in my first application and burnt some gum areas (turned white) even with wiping excess off right away. ***using a remineralization product after the bleaching I found very helpful. For me, it really helped eliminate &#x27;tooth throb&#x27; and felt soothing - the white gum areas dissipated too.  Also strengthens the enamel. Apply it at bedtime to get the full benefit.&lt;br /&gt;You need to check the expiration date with any of these whiteners. I would have given this a &amp;#34;5 star&amp;#34; if it wasn&#x27;t so difficult to find the darn date! If another customer hadn&#x27;t explained what to look for in a review - I would not have found it - mine was V027 - expires Feb 2017 - plenty fresh (it&#x27;s on the end of the syringe portion near the green push rod).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of whitening product you can. Aside from professional treatments, nothing gives you better, faster results than this. Little to no tooth sensitivity. It will irritate your gums but that goes away fairly quickly. You also don&#x27;t want to swallow any of it when it&#x27;s in, I experienced throat discomfort the next day when that happened.</li>
