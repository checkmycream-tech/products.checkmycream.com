<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s ok for this price</li>
    <li> This mask is ok. I noticed the skin was lighter for sure after I took it off.</li>
    <li> This really tightens and refreshes my face.  I am close to 70 years old and this makes my face look youthful&lt;br /&gt;and reduces wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it ! Leaves skin feeling soft and fresh. A great alternative to your spa visit. I use once every week.</li>
    <li> They noticeably improve the texture of my skin for several days after use. The size of the mask is about right to cover the entire face.</li>
    <li> Skin feels really nice after, however I didn&#x27;t realize they contained butylene and propylene glycol, wish I would have realized that before purchase!</li>
    <li> It arrived sooner than I expected. It moisturizes and calms the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love how my facial skin feels after applying it.</li>
    <li> Wow. Completely amazing. I&#x27;ve used several other brands of face masks before, but nothing compares to the smoothness i felt after using this product. After washing my face and applying toner, I put the face mask on. It says to leave for around 15-20 min, but I left it on for about 40 min. Once I took the mask off, I patted my skin then applied a moisturizer as directed (Philosophy back to nurture replenishment). The next morning, my skin was the smoothest it&#x27;s ever been. It honestly works even better than my Estee Lauder advanced night repair products. I was surprised.</li>
    <li> Love these masks. The really hydrate your face.</li>
    <li> I am very,very happy with this product,  my skin is looking more luminous, also  my skin absorbes  fast helping me on my dryness , it works like intensively on me! I personally redecomend this wonderfull product.&lt;br /&gt;The deliverywas not to fast but I had a great comunication EXCELLENT !</li>
    <li> I love it.  It is really comfortable and suitable for my sensitive skin.  I feel my skin firm after I use it.</li>
    <li> I use twice a week. It helps my facial skin look shining and feel softer</li>
    <li> I really like these mask.  It is a special treat for my face.  I feel it really nourishes and softens my face and neck.  I wear a mask about twice a week.  I keep them in the refrigerator so they really feel wonderful.  I will keep purchasing these because my face needs them.</li>
    <li> Wonderful mask! The skin is hydrated and luminous !</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin looks when i peel these off, it&#x27;s a quick fix for puffiness. will reorder</li>
    <li> Compare to other brand of facial mask I have used, this one fits better, material is thicker and skin feels tighter with smaller pores and dewy look. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This mask is just ok. After using it on my facial at night until it dry out, the next morning my skin look moisturize, but not as soft and brighten as other product.</li>
    <li> It works so well and makes my skin so smooth and minimizes the pores. I am sending the second order.</li>
    <li> took 9 days to received, very fast delivery. I live in Tx. I used a mask yesterday, left it on for 15mins in tears evening. forgot to wear moisturizer to bed,woke up with smooth moisturized skin. once completely dried, it&#x27;s not sticky.love  the product and the price. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I only used 2 of the masks so far but I love the way they make my skin feels. Very smooth and refresh can&#x27;t say I see a difference but I will continue to use. Did receive 1 extra so that was a plus</li>
    <li> I would like to point out that these are perfumed. So when it&#x27;s on your face, you will be smelling perfume. I hate perfume, so I will not be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> These are my go-to facial masks when I have to look good for photos. I&#x27;ve bought them many times now. They noticeably improve the texture of my skin for several days after use. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of masks, but haven&#x27;t had the same results as I&#x27;ve had with these.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok for a mask, the problem is to put it on and get it to stick without falling off. But afterwards, my skin feels soft. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s any better than any other type of mask. I like it that it&#x27;s individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> Definitely get results.  I use this mask after using a mud mask and toner and just love how silky smooth my face is afterward!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few collagen masks, and this one just felt like I was putting alcohol on my face. It did nothing but make my skin feel dry. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I like the mask and my skin feels moisturized after each use! Easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to dispose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask twice a week for about 3 weeks now.  It really leaves my face feeling good and my skin well moisturized for the next 12 to 24 hours. This is an actual piece of material cut out like a mask soaked with the collagen product that you place onto your face. I worked best for me to place it then recline or lie down for 10 to 20 minutes so the material remained against my skin and the collagen could soak in well.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and like it. It is a good as a salon facial. Price is right too. I not only use it on my face but use the excess on my arms and chest. I like the convenience of having a facial without having to make an appointment or leaving my house.</li>
    <li> I love this product and love how my skin looks after applying it the night before.  I let the mask rest on my face for about 15 minutes at night while watching TV.  When I use it 2-3 times a week, my skin is very soft and tighter.  Seems to plump up my skin as well.  Very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> A refreshing face mask that smooths wrinkles and is easy to use and store.  Conveniently packaged for travel.  Use once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> my favorite face mask!!!</li>
    <li> You pay for what you got  - very dry with the least amount of liquid on the mask. Worst I ever used, it stays on your face for less than 5 min than run complete dry.</li>
    <li> I like this. It did wonders for my sinus headache. My skin felt so refreshed after using it. I am buying another pack soon.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely reduced the bags under my eyes. I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it, but at least it wasn&#x27;t flowery. It smells like medicine sort of.&lt;br /&gt;But still once of my best facial mask so far.</li>
    <li> Love it!  skin feels smooth with a tightening sensation.  I use it before makeup every morning.  Makeup lasts longer, too</li>
    <li> In between facials i like to use some other products, and these masks have been one of them.  i especially like to take them away with me when on vacation and give myself a mini facial; some &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time.  I wouldn&#x27;t say they are a miracle product, but they do moisturize the skin nicely.  I also take some of the product and apply it to my neck and chest area.  For the price I think it&#x27;s a good mask.</li>
    <li> I love these face masks. Feel real good on my skin. I recommend to anyone, woman and men that want soft skin. I purchase these on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product once thus far but it does feel refreshing after placement.  Will have to review after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> i just got them a couple days ago , i used it one time , and i&#x27;ll have to see how the results are after a couple weeks</li>
    <li> It gave me itchiness on my face after the second mask and I stopped using it...</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, but after about the 3rd use, I was amazed at the difference in my skin.  The clarity, tone and softness of skin was much better than just using just a cream.  This product does not (of course)  erase every deep line and wrinkle), but the results are pretty amazing.  I will re-order these again without question.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> Its relaxing and invigorating if you refrigerate it first. Makes my skin nice and soft. Use it before bed and apply serum and night cream right after.</li>
    <li> Love these collagen mask they really are so refreshing!! Will be ordering more soon!  Love using these mask after derma rolling.</li>
    <li> I  didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after I kept the mask on until it dried-which was recommended by many users.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these Face mask! I can use the extra cream left behind inside the packet for next day use. It smooth out my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel dried out the next morning. Great products! Will buy more and use it every other day</li>
    <li> These masks are a fantastic deal. They are very moist, so will stick to your face even if you are walking around or sitting up. (I&#x27;ve bought more expensive versions that are barely moist and require you to lay flat or they&#x27;ll fall off.) Of course you will look like Jason from Halloween, but they did a great job of hydrating my dry, winter skin. The hydration lasted all day.</li>
    <li> First time to buy this product and am so pleased I&#x27;m ordering it for my sister.</li>
    <li> Always take a long time to receive it, but these are works fine and price is good. We Can do more business with.</li>
    <li> I really like these!  I leave it on my face while power napping for about 30 min and then I shower and put on a good moisturizer.  Beats expensive facials but feels refreshing and my skin does feel softer.  Using twice a week for two weeks so far.</li>
    <li> I travel for work and my skin is always dry after hours on the plane. I take one of these and my skin glows. I also use once per week at home between facials. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Now this product feels cool and relaxing, great if your in dry heat ! Perfect after a day of riding in the desert ! Hydrates, cools and seems to soften skin.....awesome!</li>
    <li> I really love them!&lt;br /&gt;it make my skin a balance perfect! no more brightening and my skin is more elastic and an alive look!</li>
    <li> just tried the first time using this kind of mask. I ordered a series of various scents and tried this no scent first. It felt very fresh, comfortable, relax,... during and after use (very easy to use). It kept my skin moisture for a day and two (I have an normal oil skin). I would use it every 2-3 days, depending on the weather around. I would recommend people to try it, at least one time. You would glad to give it a try.</li>
    <li> My friend introduced these to me as a gift! WOW, I an 56 years old and I love this product! I just ordered two more! Eight of my friends and family have started using them! They love them as well! Can&#x27;t beat the price and I am so happy to find something that works and is very reasonable! I use them three times a week and all I can say is....try it once....you will love it!</li>
    <li> I had a med spa treatment which the Collagen Facial Mask was used. I loved the results afterwards.</li>
    <li> Feels so great on your face. I usually leave the mask on my face till it dries out.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this with the essence combo mask number 3 from the seoulglamour.&lt;br /&gt;They always send one extra sample different mask to try out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really good buy for cheap price and make you feel so replenished&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay! this is the second time I received this mask from different seller, the A-poly (only took 2wks again with the other sample products, this seller is great with packaging and no doubt on fake products). I think I am going to keep ordering this.&lt;br /&gt;Really helps your skin feel moisted. I ran out of this mask for close to 2wks, coudln&#x27;t wait till it comes. Use this every other day or once a wk. what&#x27;s so great is my kids always poke on my face whenever I have the mask on and they tell me that they want to try it on and tell me that I smell great. ^^</li>
    <li> Not really good. I&#x27;ve been using so many masks from Asian markets, and I&#x27;m from China. I have to say there are so many good masks in Asian markets, u can buy it from online and ship worldwide. But u can use this mask on ur body skin, if u take care of ur whole body skin, and that&#x27;s the good idea!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Product as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> surprised at how amazing my skin feels and looks after this mask. so soft, skin feels much tighter &amp; refreshed!</li>
    <li> Cool and refreshing, after 15 minutes your skin looks brighter, less tired. Effects last a day or so. Recommend 3 a week.</li>
    <li> These actually work so well. It&#x27;s like a paper-cloth material loaded with the collagen serum and stays on the skin nicely. I really enjoy using these. I have VERY sensitive skin so I was extremely nervous trying them just in case my skin reacted to it. But nothing happened except my skin felt good and was moisturized. Definitely good for these New England winters!</li>
    <li> Order came very fast! I used it right away, and the results was pleasantly surprised. .better than I expected..made my skin very soft...I will use it for awhile to see. I am giving some to my friends to try..will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Great feel the sensation right away and I can tell it really makes my skin look more smooth.  Will continue to use and purchase</li>
    <li> it was ok. nothing astonishing</li>
    <li> won&#x27;t but again.... Can&#x27;t tell significant improve on my skin</li>
    <li> This pack is good for the price and it seems to work so I stopped going to the spa for my collagen monthly regimen. I have to note that if you have a small face like mine this is way big, but I just let hang, fold or cut it. It&#x27;s almost soaking wet so I have to put the rest of the liquid down my neck which is a plus. It&#x27;s easy to wash off; I love it.</li>
    <li> I feel this product has done it&#x27;s job, my face looks and feels great!  Although, the printing on the package should be larger for us older people!</li>
    <li> Gave the products as gifts.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it.  Says it makes her skin smoother.  As long as she is happy, she makes me happy.</li>
    <li> This mask is very thin, but I rather like it because it stays on your face once you put it on and doesn&#x27;t slide off.  Also, the extra collagen that collects at the bottom of the pack can easily be used on top of the mask since the mask is so thin.  The only negative is that like most masks, it does a poor job in sizing so that the area below the nose and above the lip is covered.</li>
    <li> Not really work on my face, no big different after I used it !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good I like it .</li>
    <li> I LOVE these masks. They leave my skin so soft and pretty, and I have been getting more compliments on my skin lately. I am pushing 40, but look younger (thanks Mom for the good genes!). But I&#x27;m starting to see some thinning of the skin and light wrinkling. This helps nourish my skin and make it feel more plump and hydrated.</li>
    <li> My favorite mask. Tightens and leaves skin looking and feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good product, thanks.</li>
    <li> Great mask, they make my face feel so smooth and soft. My skin has a hard time absorbing moisturizers of any kind but it loved this! I will be buying more on a frequent basis :)</li>
    <li> I got these as my first mask, so I didn&#x27;t have really any expectations. I tried it out and was underwhelmed. after using a few more masks and gaining some standards I tried it again and realized that it actually didn&#x27;t do anything other than make me break out. Very disapointed, definitely not going to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I like this mask when my face is feeling dehydrated, but I don&#x27;t find it to be anything special. After removing the mask, my face feels dirty sometimes, like a film has been left on it, and I need to wipe it off. I also find that these type of masks are hard to keep on the face. There&#x27;s always some piece that&#x27;s flapping around that won&#x27;t stick to the skin, but what do you expect from a one size fits all mask?</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re awesome. Very moist. Will order again once I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I am a Licensed Esthetician - always looking for an affordable way to up my own skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Start with a clean and gently exfoliated face  - Add Mask for 20 minutes and you will feel hydrated and firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used these on my husband and was very impressed at the effectiveness vs price.  Yes, it took some talking to get him to put it on but after he saw the results he was impressed too!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!!! Nice little treat once in a while to pamper yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I followed another reviewers suggestions about how to get the all of the leftover fluid out of each individual package and it works wonderfully!  ABSOLUTELY worth the money.</li>
    <li> I just turned 50 last week and fortunately I really don&#x27;t have many winkles on my face, but my neck is showing it&#x27;s age. After reading the other reviews I decided to try these masks.  I used the first one 3 days ago and noticed my face and neck were smoother after using it.  I took the advice of others and used another one tonight. I am really amazed at how well this product works, the lines I do have are smoother and less noticeable. After taking the mask off my face, I fold it and put it on my neck, as they have plenty of moisture left in them. It sticks pretty well to the neck and I leave it on for another 15 or so minutes, then I rub in the remaining product really well. I can already sees the signs of aging disappearing some in the sagginess of my neck.  I don&#x27;t know if it will last if I stop using the masks, but for the price, I&#x27;m going to continue with them.&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage is you look like a creature from a horror movie with it on, my husband just laughs at me.  I don&#x27;t know if they will work that well for everyone, but I&#x27;m sold on them already.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product did not see a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> These masks are super hydrating and make my skin really supple and bouncy feeling :)</li>
    <li> Great product for great price was packaged well and I received it in a timely manner. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love these a real bargin</li>
    <li> Ok so far. I used a different brand in the past, but the price was getting out of control, so I looked on Amazon for a cheaper product, but with good reviews. I decided to take a chance on these, and for the most part, I like them. They are a thicker material than the ones I used before which is nice, but they are a little too big for my face. The package is in Korean ( I think ) and the english on the bottom is kind of broken, but the product is pretty straight forward as far as use. It says to leave them on for 20 mins, but I tend to leave mine on unil my skin feels tight which is closer to 40 mins. My only actual complaint is that my face feels very sticky after removing the mask. Directions state to tap face until it&#x27;s absorbed after removal, but that really doesn&#x27;t seem to help much. I&#x27;m in my late 20s, so wrinkles aren&#x27;t an issue for me, but this is mainly a preventative measure. The main benefit for me is that it leaves my skin looking less red so i hardly have to wear foundation or powder. Also, i have sensitive skin, and they dont break my face out. Directions also recommend using 3 to 4 times a week, but i usually only use them 2x a week.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE... That is all I have for this product. It is amazing and I will never stop purchasing these amazing mask sheets.</li>
    <li> Taken from the review I wrote on the first batch I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped going to a spa for facial probably in the last 2 years since the service of the one I went to had gone downhill. Coming across this Full Face Mask at a price that is very reasonable, what the heck, why not try it? Even if it&#x27;s not good, not too much damage in terms of money. However, one thing that you may be concerned is whether you would have allergic reaction to it. I was concerned also as I have sensitive skin and toward the dry side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used it, I did a home \\&quot;facial\\&quot; first - steam, exfoliate and clean. Then I put on the mask but I leave it on my face while working on my computer. By the time I realized, it&#x27;s been on for an hour. The instructions say to leave it on for 20 min. The mask was sort of dry by that tme and my face felt tight. After I lifted off the mask, my face felt baby soft. Very nice and happy! I&#x27;ve used 8 masks so far and no allergic reactions after all this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week, I used it 3 times. Then I slowed down to 2 times a week then 1 time a week. I&#x27;ve learned some tricks now to get every drop of the essence and get my money&#x27;s worth. I use it before I go to sleep at night now.&lt;br /&gt;1. When I pull out the face mask (folded in quarters), it&#x27;s very wet. So I wipe the excess on the edge of the mask over my face and neck first. Yes, neck too.&lt;br /&gt;2. Then I unfold the mask and line it up to my face. Note, it&#x27;ll be a little off because our faces all have different sizes. Just work with it.&lt;br /&gt;3. I then lay in my bed either read or close my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;4. After 45 min - 1 hr, my face feels tight (signal for me the mask is drying).I take the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;5. I cut open the pouch and scoop every drop out with my fingers and put it on my face and neck. Yes, my neck again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE VERDICT&lt;br /&gt;Not only does my face feel soft, the most dramatic difference I see is in the line (crease) across the front of my neck - usedto be deep and obvious even when I stretched my neck straight up. Now of course it&#x27;s still there but it&#x27;s light and smooth versus all the little crosses along the crease due to dryness and slightly loose skin. Oh no, I&#x27;m not a senior citizen yet :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION&lt;br /&gt;Here, I&#x27;ve put myself as guinea pig. I&#x27;ve also gotten my sister and sister-in-law trying it and buying it. Since you are reading this, I&#x27;m recommending to you - yes, you also! Be pampered and feel beautiful!</li>
    <li> My skin looked glowing and healthy, all day long! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> used once and not sure if it did anything or not.  in no hurry to use again.</li>
    <li> I just received this last week and tried it only once. I liked it.  Feels good; smells good.</li>
    <li> Similar to the previous reviewer: received my masks ahead of schedule with a freebie!! Love this seller - will definitely be ordering from them again. I have been using these facial masks for YEARS (used to purchase in Seoul and Hong Kong)... and although they are cheap, they do the job and leave your skin extremely soft, fresh and firm.</li>
    <li> amazing i&#x27;ll order again</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Makes you look younger after first use.</li>
    <li> Great product, face feels renewed and so very baby soft....a truly great fine and I am hooked on this one! Skin feeling velvet soft and has a dewy glow....want a professional treatment then this is yours, enjoy!  Afterwards your skin will drink in your serums and creams....have a spa party or,  a personal night with your sweetie and have fun celebrating each other...you will love it....As fine as any spa treatment I have had and now I can do in my own home....
