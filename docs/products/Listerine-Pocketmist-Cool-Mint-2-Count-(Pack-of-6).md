    <li> Because of some medical issues I&#x27;m not supposed to chew gum.  So this stuff works perfectly.  It&#x27;s really strong, no one needs more than 3 sprays (and even that can be painful if your tolerance is low) to kill any bad breath.  One of these fits easily in my pocket.  And there&#x27;s no mess like there can be with the strips.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these. They were no longer available locally so we bought them on line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cool mint oral care mist for years. I use it on the job as I&#x27;m a casino dealer.</li>

    <li> My dad loves these.. He&#x27;s a smoker and he always carries pocket mist with him because he has to talk to clients everyday. I&#x27;ve been trying to find cheaper alternatives to this but he says nothing compares to the listerine pocket mist.</li>
