      <li>I loved them then and was so excited to see that they were available on line.</li>
      <li>and although I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, these  work the best for me.  </li>
      <li>thanks to Amazon I have been able to continue using it and at a better price too!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s another Eye Q&#x27;s makeup remover pads that come with a pinkish label and those are actually more user friendly.  </li>
      <li>delivery was very quick.</li>
      <li>Takes my eye make-up off so easy.</li>
      <li>I can easily dip q-tips into to get around the rims of my eyelashes easier.</li>
      <li>Now I am just going to shop the easy way--on line</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have used these for years to easily remove the mascara.  </li>
      <li>I have used these for years, they take your make up off easily without burning your eyes.  </li>
      <li>These eye makeup remover pads are so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>These are absolutely the best for removing any eye make-up and they are loaded with oil which keeps your eyes smooth and soft!  </li>
      <li>I never have any problems with eyelash thinning and I started out with fine eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t worry about them drying up as more quickly than I can use them.</li>
      <li>I thought of making a mix of my own, based on the ingredients list, but it&#x27;s much easier to just get these because they&#x27;re pre-soaked</li>
      <li>This is the single-most effective and gentle make-up remover I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a big fan of this product for years and my eyes looks great.</li>
      <li>But overall did a great job removing eye makeup</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so effective that I don&#x27;t even have to use a whole pad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had problems finding a good cleanser that gets rid of all the mascara and liner COMPLETELY.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an effective eye makeup remover (a lot more effective than some other options) for the price.</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>So it would work if you plan to use before washing face, except even after I need to use something to clean up mascara</li>
      <li>there were so many positive comments.  </li>
      <li>As always, I am delighted with my recent purchase of eye make-up remover pads from Anazon.</li>
      <li>I had to press them against my eye for a full 30 seconds and then rub like heck to get any makeup to come off, and I do not wear waterproof eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>I love the ingredients especially the light oil that removes all traces of mascara and moisturizes all around the eyes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard olive oil or baby oil work, but I have sensitive eyes and wasn&#x27;t sure if those would irritate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, just use it right before going to bed.</li>
      <li>This product has been indispensable for me for many years, but it becomes more and more difficult to find in stock.  </li>
      <li>I strongly feel that these pads have also helped to keep the skin around my eyes and lashes soft and conditioned.</li>
      <li>They do leave a bit of oily residue, but are quick &amp; gentle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked at the ingredients and it&#x27;s mostly oils, so naturally, my eyes are very oily after using this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many brands and always have my eyes burn and get red, but not with these.</li>
      <li>Either way, they do Exactly what I need them to do, which is to remove all of the waterproof mascara that I use on my eye lashes.</li>
      <li>One pad is more than enough to remove the make-up and mascara from both eyes.</li>
      <li>They are excellent, but too large (the size of a paper towel) and pretty expensive.</li>
      <li>and it came pretty fast</li>
      <li>The only thing is that it is super super oily.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes the top pads will get dry but you can just flip it upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick and easy way to remove waterproof mascara and other eye products.  </li>
      <li>Great price for a product that I have previously bought at a local beauty supply store for 3</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are way too greasy for me, it takes off eye makeup but only after using several pads but your eyes are completely greasy and have to wash face.  So it would work if you plan to use before washing face, except even after I need to use something to clean up mascara so I have to use something else so I don&#x27;t have to wash again.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  I like to be able to use after washing face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 25 years maybe even over 30. I love the ingredients especially the light oil that removes all traces of mascara and moisturizes all around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years... and am thrilled to be able to get it from Amazon! No burning eyes...</li>
    <li> This product is unusable.  The oil gets in your eyes and is very irritating.  I thought I was ordering their oil-free product which I&#x27;ve used before and is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this remover for a very long time and when my local Walgreens stopped carrying it some years ago I despaired at finding it again but thanks to Amazon I have been able to continue using it and at a better price too! It&#x27;s a little oily but I like that and it works very well to remove my mascara.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best for removing waterproof mascara.  It&#x27;s not quite as messy as using baby oil and it travels easily.</li>
    <li> I searched on Drugstore.com for the BEST eye makeup remover based on ratings and ordered these.  I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since, and when I found them cheaper on Amazon, just ordered a 3pack.  They are VERY oily, so they will moisturize and remove all traces of your eye make-up.  Yes it is true that the middle pads tend to be dried out -- I use them everyday so I don&#x27;t worry about them drying up as more quickly than I can use them. There is no scent to them.  Nothing works better, not Neutrogena, Lancôme, or otherwise.  They are about $5.00 at the drugstore, if you can find them, the only time I have was at a local Rite-Aid, other stores seem to not have anymore so I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue.  The other versions of EyeQ (Waterproof, Gentle, etc.) do not work as well.</li>
    <li> I used these years ago. Was thrilled to find them online. The only pads I find in stores are non oily type, which I don&#x27;t like. These work fast and leave a nice moisturizer behind.</li>
    <li> Once half way down the middle, some pads seem to be missing products or dry. But overall did a great job removing eye makeup</li>
    <li> I used the travel size of this product on a cruise we took recently.  I wore a ton of eye makeup at night, and using only one pad (both sides) took everything off.  I will warn you though- the pads are SOAKED in an oil-based remover, so if you don&#x27;t like the oil remaining on your eyes, wash your face to remove the excess.  I was so sunburned though, after washing my entire face, I used another pad as a facial moisurizer to help prevent peeling- and it worked like a charm.  It didn&#x27;t clog my pores and I never broke out- and I even used another face cream on top of that.  I use this product year-round, but it will be a must-have for the summer months not only to remove eye makeup, but to keep my skin moisturized and prevent peeling after a day in the sun.  I&#x27;m 45 and have 3 teenage daughters who also give this product a thumbs up- it works for us.</li>
    <li> Andrea Eye O&#x27;s--still the best eyemakeup remover for the price.  No irritants.  Just wipe gently and even heaviest mascara is gone.</li>
    <li> We have been using these make-up removers for several years now. By far ordering it on Amazon has given us the best pricing and speedy delivery. Number 1 in our catalog of repeat product orders.</li>
    <li> These have oil in them, and a lot of it. They work, but as a future physician, I must recommend against putting oil into your pores... At least if your into beauty and an acne-free face.</li>
    <li> I am wondering if I got a faulty batch.  While others complained about the pads being too greasy, I found them to have hardly any solution on them at all.  I had to press them against my eye for a full 30 seconds and then rub like heck to get any makeup to come off, and I do not wear waterproof eye makeup.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have extremely sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.  I use waterproof mascara and I could not find any product that would not cause my eyes and skin to be so irritated after using it.  Not only does this product remover the eye makeup, it moistures the delicate skin around my eyes. Some people do not care for the oil formula,  so Andrea EyeQs makes a non-oily formula.  I have used this product for years.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years and although I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, these  work the best for me.  What I like about them most is they don&#x27;t have many other unnecessary ingredients and fragrance.  They do leave a bit of oily residue, but are quick &amp; gentle.  I will continue to use them as long as I can find them!</li>
    <li> I like these but they turned out a bit too moist for me - i.e. too much of the liquid on the pads.  There&#x27;s another Eye Q&#x27;s makeup remover pads that come with a pinkish label and those are actually more user friendly.  The remover tends to get into my eyes with these.</li>
    <li> The makeup removing pads stay moist in the container.  The pads completely take off all the makeup leaving no residue behind.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t perform as well as I would like... They&#x27;re good for travel because they aren&#x27;t liquid, but don&#x27;t clean up as well either.</li>
    <li> This product has been indispensable for me for many years, but it becomes more and more difficult to find in stock.  Now I am just going to shop the easy way--on line--sorry local beauty supply stores that don&#x27;t stay stocked.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years to easily remove the mascara.  I have tried other brands, but I always come back to these.  They are moist enough that you don&#x27;t pull on the skin around your eyes, but not greasy.  I think you&#x27;ll like them. They do a good job.  They are also good for removing the rest of your make up.</li>
    <li> As always, I am delighted with my recent purchase of eye make-up remover pads from Anazon. So glad I am a PRIME member. Best decision I ever made. I love Amazon😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands and always have my eyes burn and get red, but not with these. They work great and no burning!</li>
    <li> Quick and easy way to remove waterproof mascara and other eye products.  The mineral oil is very light and does not irritate eyes</li>
    <li> These are like cleaning your eyes with oil.  I actually had to use cold water and a cloth to remove all the oil that made a film over my eyes.  They are a great bargain price but I would never use them again.  I value my eyes too much. Check out my other reviews on eye make-up remover.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Completely takes off the toughest mascara and it moisturizes under your eyes. I don&#x27;t need to use under eye cream. I just use Andrea&#x27;s Eye Q&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve been a big fan of this product for years and my eyes looks great.</li>
    <li> These eye makeup remover pads are decent. They do the job, but they are VERY oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-They DO disintegrate ALL makeup.&lt;br /&gt;-Gentle to use, very little scrubbing and tugging needed.&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable, relative to other options&lt;br /&gt;-Convenient, pre-soaked pads. Sometimes the top pads will get dry but you can just flip it upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Oil tends to get into my eyes no matter how careful I am, probably because I don&#x27;t like to leave any residue between my eyelashes. It doesn&#x27;t burn, which is great but it does create an annoying blurry film in my eyes that will only go away with time (you can&#x27;t rinse oil with water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You have to wash your eyelids with something else afterwards if you want the oil residue to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you&#x27;re lazy and don&#x27;t wash the oil away, it can cause milia under your eyes, little small bumps that texture your under eyes which I have found happen to me whenever I use too oily of an under eye cream or don&#x27;t wash off the oil from these pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL THOUGHTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an effective eye makeup remover (a lot more effective than some other options) for the price. There are better options out there though. I especially like the Clinique remover which is just as effective but has a much less oily feel to it, and I can easily dip q-tips into to get around the rims of my eyelashes easier. The only thing is that the Clinique is pricier.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely the best for removing any eye make-up and they are loaded with oil which keeps your eyes smooth and soft!  A great wrinkle helper around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I never have any problems with eyelash thinning and I started out with fine eyelashes.  No problems with the use of this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Been using it for over twenty years!!</li>
    <li> Definately takes eye makeup off but the oil from the pad ALWAYS seems to get into my eyes and then mysight goes blurry until i dont wipe with a makeup wipe.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes so that oils when comes out when I take my make up of my eyes , it tears non stop&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t recommend this product to those who have sensitive eyes like me .</li>
    <li> Great eye makeup remover!  Takes off any and every junk you put on your eyes.  The only thing is that it is super super oily.  Obviously it is needed to take the makeup off!</li>
    <li> I have to wear waterproof eye makeup because my tear ducts overproduce tears and I&#x27;d have mascara/liner running down my face all the time! I&#x27;ve had problems finding a good cleanser that gets rid of all the mascara and liner COMPLETELY. I&#x27;ve used a few Clinique products, Neutrogena, Ponds, Dove, Johnson&amp;Johnson, Clean&amp;Clear...but none of them get off ALL the eye makeup, unless I really rub hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard olive oil or baby oil work, but I have sensitive eyes and wasn&#x27;t sure if those would irritate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I came across these little pads. They work like a dream! I&#x27;ve looked at the ingredients and it&#x27;s mostly oils, so naturally, my eyes are very oily after using this product. I don&#x27;t mind it because I always wash my face after using these anyway. I like that they come in a small container because it makes them easy to travel with. I thought of making a mix of my own, based on the ingredients list, but it&#x27;s much easier to just get these because they&#x27;re pre-soaked and I wouldn&#x27;t need to buy cotton balls/pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that complain about them being too oily: did you look at the ingredients?? OF COURSE THEY&#x27;RE OILY!!</li>
    <li> I do often lose a few lashes, but it gets all the make-up off. I bought a bunch, and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have them everywhere, on my night stand, bath, baggage, everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the fastest eye makeup remover i&#x27;ve ever experience. Also, does not has leave your eye with the feeling of been scratched because of the moisturized effect it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the other hand, this mosturized effect may be a little too oily for any one, so you may need to use a tissue to clean it up at the end of use.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. Takes my eye make-up off so easy. One swipe and I&#x27;m good. Love, love, love them. If you wear eye make-up then this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> Love the product and have been using it for years</li>
    <li> Love this product - -have been using it for years.  Love the convenience of a 3-pack.  Keeps eyes moisturized overnight.</li>
    <li> I wanted these eye make up remover pads, thought it would be convenient to take for trips. But after trying these a few times, they are just not worth it. First of, the pad itself is super thin and seems almost dry until u start rubbing/ taking off make up from the eye area. Its super oily and I was shocked to see that much grease. I didnt mind that but it is a lot greasier than Neutrogena eye makeup remover. While it did remove the eye shadows easily enough, it took some heavy rubbing to remove the gel and pencil eye liners. And this product failed miserably in removing mascara. I tried a few different types from Este Lauder, Nyx, Sephora, Lancome, Maybelline and Covergirl. I tried rubbing gently, swiped, massaged etc but no matter what I did my mascara wouldnt even budge, not even the non-waterproof ones! So ridiculous. Instead, I lost a few eye lashes every time i tried to remove mascara with it! This product didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the 4+ stars reviews.  They arrived today and I was anxious to try them out.  I previously had been using Neutrogena make up remover wipes in the blue package.  They are excellent, but too large (the size of a paper towel) and pretty expensive. With these pads, the eye make-up comes off, but be prepared for your eye to look like you&#x27;ve taken off your make-up with lip gloss!  These things are mostly mineral oil.  You have to wash your hands afterwards and blot the slick leftover off your eye with tissues.  These would definitely stain bedding, so not something that you can reach for in your bedside table when you realize you didn&#x27;t take your make-up off before bed.  Now I have 180 of these things I won&#x27;t be using.  Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t have contact lenses in, but these will definitely oil them over and mess with your vision with the oil! These are not like other wipes that you can use on your whole face.  I guess you could, but I&#x27;d just as soon smear myself with Vaseline -- same outcome!</li>
    <li> These eye makeup remover pads are so easy to use.  It never takes a long time to take the makeup off using these pads, and it is extremely convenient/great for travel.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for years. Love that they take off my eye makeup without getting oil in my eyes. No muss, no fuss.</li>
    <li> These work wonderfully.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these way back when they were first on the market, probably in the 70s or 80s. I loved them then and was so excited to see that they were available on line. They are definitely not the same - for one thing, they are TINY compared to the originals - it&#x27;s hard to actually hold them and wipe eye makeup because they are so small in diameter. It also seems to me like they are much oiler than they were before, but that could be me mis-remembering, so I could be wrong about that. They still work, but honestly, I could just go back to using round flat cotton pads and baby oil, and it would less expensive over all, and more effective because of the oil-to-pad ratio.</li>
    <li> I have always used this brand of remover pads. They take off the eyemakeup very easily.  The price that I got these were much cheaper than if I had bought it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I must say this review was written by my wife Karen.  She is the one who uses it.</li>
    <li> These are The Best Makeup Remover pads that I&#x27;ve found Anywhere. Yes, they have a bit of Oily substance on them which can sometimes get into the eye, but it is non irritating unless the contacts are already in. Either way, they do Exactly what I need them to do, which is to remove all of the waterproof mascara that I use on my eye lashes. I strongly feel that these pads have also helped to keep the skin around my eyes and lashes soft and conditioned. I have used these for years and know they do Much more than I expected!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive product to remove eye makeup with no pain.  Leaves a nice smooth moisturizing effect.  Worth the money! Great product</li>
    <li> I love this product, yeah they&#x27;re oily, but they work GREAT! I&#x27;ve been unable to find at local stores for 2 years and previously purchased at drugstoredotcom, but Amazon is less expensive and Prime shipping is free. I&#x27;m stocking up as I&#x27;m paranoid the product will be discontinued and NOTHING else has ever done as good a job at easy mascara removal.</li>
    <li> This eyemakeup remover was GROSS!  It was so oily that my vision became blurred and redness occurred on the eyelid even after I had squeezed out the excess on the pad  before applying.  Wish I would have read S.E. Meland&#x27;s review before ordering but there were so many positive comments.  Threw all 3 containers into the trash!!</li>
    <li> I love these pads. I find the pre-soaked pads extremely convenient and easy to use. One pad is more than enough to remove the make-up and mascara from both eyes. They are oily, but do not irritate my eyes. I do however still wash my face after I have used them. The skin surrounding my eyes feels soft and moisturized after use. They also seem to condition my lashes as they seem much less prone to breaking as can happen when you rub around the eye area.</li>
    <li> The product removes make-up, even the most difficult,  and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I recomend it for anyone with sensitive eyelids and eyes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this product for a while and glad I finally found it online. These are one of the best makeup removers out there because of the mineral oil in them. I am giving it 4 stars because some of the pads were dried when I opened the container, strange because the containers are sealed. But great product otherwise and price. You get three of these containers, can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and love it....... :) It moisturizes the eyes so well and makes them feel good.</li>
    <li> excellent product, thank you....delivery was very quick. very happy&lt;br /&gt;with product.... use this every day and works very well.have been using this&lt;br /&gt;eye q&#x27;s for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every eye makeup remover product out there and I can tell you this one is the best. It removes all traces of eye makeup, including waterproof mascara, without rubbing or drying out the eye area.  I find it totally non irritating and although is a bit greasy (they do make one that is not, but it doesn&#x27;t do the job as well), just use it right before going to bed. You definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to use this if you were looking to remove and re-do your makeup right away. Some of the other products are greasy and thick and heavy - but this one is moisturizing and definitely not as heavy.  I love this product.  Hope they never take it off the market.  Andrea... are you listening???  :))</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product and the timely fashion it was received.</li>
    <li> Great price for a product that I have previously bought at a local beauty supply store for 3 x&#x27;s the price!</li>
    <li> Been using Andrea forever and no one sells it anymore locally. Very hapy that I did find it online and it came pretty fast</li>
    <li> not that good at removing makeup&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena is the way to go! I don&#x27;t have anymoe words, the item is not that great</li>
    <li> I have used these for years, they take your make up off easily without burning your eyes.  I have used Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clinique, etc. makeup removers in the past and I always like this product the best.  I belive the product is discontinued from all the retail stores now, thank goodness I found them on Amazon and at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is the single-most effective and gentle make-up remover I have ever used. I&#x27;ve also used it to completely remove foundation without drying my skin out with a harsher soap, which I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so effective that I don&#x27;t even have to use a whole pad. This stuff lasts forever, because I can just dip a finger onto the pad, wipe my eyes gentle to remove any make-up, and then wipe off all residue with a tissue. Definitely a great product.</li>
    <li> These eye makeup remover pads ae smaller than others to which I&#x27;m accustomed. They do the job at a reasonsble price.</li>
