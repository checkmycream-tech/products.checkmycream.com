      <li>It does the job just as good as the professional machines that run in the thousands.</li>
      <li>I will continue and see within a three month period to see if there are significant changes.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t really seen a significant difference.</li>
      <li>Therefore, acquiring one  of the more  desirable units w/a larger power rheostat (which provides a significantly greater current) is catch-as-catch ...</li>
      <li>The power through the glass comb is not enough and that is what I needed most.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying it and starting  to see results</li>
      <li>w/daily multiple uses (latest units are at that length of time and counting)</li>
      <li>Buying 2 units (they&#x27;re cheap enough to buy two for the benefits provided) allows for leaving the 2 most useful probes (the large flat, circular probe and the oval probe, the 2 on the right in the image) inserted into one unit each and leaving those in place (v. taking them out and reinserting which weakens the glue that holds the probes in the metal contacts).</li>
      <li>It was obviously glued in - cheap construction.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way it came packaged.</li>
      <li>&amp; she really noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>Works very well paired with Roberts Reasearch Laboratories Gel Products</li>
      <li>The high frequency works well</li>

      <li>I love this little tool!</li>
      <li>I used to work at a spa and had access to a professional high frequency machine.</li>

<ol>
    <li> piece of crap.  broke after having it for only 2 months</li>
    <li> I am enjoying it and starting  to see results</li>
    <li> It is good for personal use , quite cost effective.</li>
    <li> The high frequency works well but it could be more powerful.The power through the glass comb is not enough and that is what I needed most.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I am using it properly. Instructions are ver vague. Can anyone email me the specs on how you use it in facial wrinkles, please. I&#x27;m confused on what to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product about 5 weeks and one of the glass pieces have already become disengaged from the mounting that fits into the wand.  It was obviously glued in - cheap construction.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> After 2 months doesnt work</li>
    <li> Am very happy with it, except for the instructions.  There&#x27;s a caution on the box which I cannot understand!  Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> At first I was doing it everyday until I felt the excess water in my nose and throat so now I have slowed down to three times a week and now I am starting to see a difference. I will continue and see within a three month period to see if there are significant changes.</li>
    <li> HAVE NOT USED IT YET BUT BOUGHT IT BASED ON GREAT REVIEWS TERRIFIC PRICE</li>
    <li> I got this product and I am very happy with it. This machine is a serious treatment. It&#x27;s like having a professional beautician at home. I plan to get another one as a gift for my friend</li>
    <li> I love this little tool! It really does ward off acne if you give it a zap when you notice it&#x27;s developing,  and it helps to clear existing acne in just a couple of days max.</li>
    <li> Great salon quality, same results. Works very well paired with Roberts Reasearch Laboratories Gel Products</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re drunk you won&#x27;t be able to feel this. But,  then again, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be trying to shock your &amp;#34;face&amp;#34;, or other parts of your body, while intoxicated. Or anyone else&#x27;s for that matter. Without adding alcohol to the equation,  this is an ok toy for adults. Not for children.</li>
    <li> bought to help stimulate growth of hair on my head a friend did this &amp; she really noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> Very low quality. One electrode broken in first time usage.</li>
    <li> I used to work at a spa and had access to a professional high frequency machine. My skin was really missing the benefits of using it. So I searched and found this one. It does the job just as good as the professional machines that run in the thousands. I really like the way it came packaged. I am happy with the decision to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Multiple pieces arrived broken and it is just a gimmick product.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Works awesome! the directions weren&#x27;t that great but being a licensed Aesthetician I already know how to use one.</li>
    <li> Works very well at eradicating pathogens internally (proper technique, not mentioned in the instructions b/c the FDA would get their undies in a serious bunch: Apply the probe over the infection while grounding any part of your body opposite that application site; the electrons emitted will pass thru to the ground and fry uninvited germs ... oh, and don&#x27;t mention this technique to anyone prone to be a rat). Problem: Glass probes are fragile. Buying 2 units (they&#x27;re cheap enough to buy two for the benefits provided) allows for leaving the 2 most useful probes (the large flat, circular probe and the oval probe, the 2 on the right in the image) inserted into one unit each and leaving those in place (v. taking them out and reinserting which weakens the glue that holds the probes in the metal contacts). The vendors on these products are apparently Chinese and not amenable to replacing anything even if defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the probe glue begins to weaken, the conductivity is affected and the units will begin to transmit weaker current; using multi-units lengthens the life of the probes such that, e.g., the power units (which are also adversely affected by the glue weakening) and probes will last several months w/daily multiple uses (latest units are at that length of time and counting) v. 6-8 weeks (unaccceptable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the vendors, as do many of the Chinese vendors, go in and out of business like peas in the old shell game. Therefore, acquiring one  of the more  desirable units w/a larger power rheostat (which provides a significantly greater current) is catch-as-catch ... uh, catch-me-if-you-can.</li>
    <li> It is working fine but I haven&#x27;t really seen a significant difference. I will continue to use it however. Why not?!</li>
    <li> This portable high frequency is great and it has greatly helped my hair problems.</li>
