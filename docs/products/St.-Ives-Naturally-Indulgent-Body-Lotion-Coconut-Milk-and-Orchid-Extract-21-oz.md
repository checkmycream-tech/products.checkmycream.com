    <li> love this product will be ordering it again cant await love the smell good for summer you wont be disapointed at all</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives already, but this is the BEST smelling lotion that I will buy it again and again for myself and my friends. It is that good!</li>
    <li> St. Ives is the only body lotion I love to use. I am mostly all natural or close to it products, but this is one of the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; products I just love to use. I use this with a little shea butter after a shower and my skin is just awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have purchased approximately 1 bottle every 6 weeks for at least 2 years.  It&#x27;s not a super heavy lotion. I use it all over after every shower and on my hands every time I wash them.  I keep a bottle at my desk and several co-workers and commented favorably about the lovely scent.  2 of them have bought their own bottles of it for their desks!</li>
    <li> not the best...but smells pretty</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to use after epilating and I absolutely love it - it really soothes my irritated skin and leaves it feeling soft and silky. This lotion absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t runny or greasy and it smells wonderful! I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions and have always been dissatisfied for one reason or another. I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve finally found a winner!</li>
    <li> St. Ives Naturally Indulgent Body Lotion with Coconut Milk &amp; Orchid Extract is one of my favorite lotions. I&#x27;ve used a LOT of different lotions, and I can tell you that this is a quality lotion that is comparable to high-end lotions that are 5x the price. Not only does it smell amazing, it is also extremely moisturizing. A lot of lotions that smell good have too much perfume in them and actually end up drying your skin. This lotion smells wonderful and hydrates your skin at the same time. I put this lotion on my whole body after every shower and I&#x27;ve been complimented on how soft my skin is. Living in Chicago, during the winter my skin used to be extremely dry and sometimes crack. Since I&#x27;ve been using this lotion, I never have that problem anymore. It&#x27;s a non-greasy lotion and it dries super quick. An added bonus: it&#x27;s free of parabens and phthalates. You can&#x27;t beat the price; try it for yourself and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about!!</li>
    <li> Nice smelling lotion &amp; moisturizer</li>
    <li> I am a 66 year old female and over the years my skin has become dryer and dryer even to the point that my skin actually hurt.  I have tried many different lotions and some were even watery and sticky afterwards. Terrible feeling.  This lotion of St. Ives is fantastic. It is thick and creamy with a great smell.  Afterwards my skin does not feel sticky, it feels soft and silky, even the next day.  It does not have parabens or phthalates or animal ingredients which is an extra plus for me.  I love this lotion and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> i really like this body lotion its thick it smells really nice like flowers and sugar. I put that all over my body and hands because i have dry skin when i don&#x27;t apply anything and i really like the  fact that its not greesy at all and the skin fully absorbs it in 1 minute</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin this is recommended, like seriously. I use the facial scrub plus this and a organic face soap and this helps tremendously. I so love this. The other lotions don&#x27;t compare to this. I used the other ones nope this is the best our of them all.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this lotion and it is a great all body lotion.  Not greasy, absorbs completely and a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this, myself, but a friend told me about it and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t take the scent, or aroma,  myself, but some can.  Just saying, it may not be&lt;br /&gt;for everybody.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels clean, moisture abounds.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, keeps my skin soft, and is very non- greasy.  Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, and maybe he cheapest too.</li>
    <li> After using this lotion for a month I have to give it one star.  It does not moisturize well at all.  My skin has become very dry after using this lotion and I do not recommend it at all.  Also, be warned it has a very strong feminine scent.</li>
    <li> This is really an amazing body lotion at such low price.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a good skin moisturizing and the smell is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This beats the Olay body lotion at half the price.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing. The orchid scent is very light, and not too overpowering. And it absorbs really fast (but I live in a dry climate, so I can&#x27;t say this is true for everyone)</li>
    <li> I love, love, love St Ives products they&#x27;re always moisturizing and soothing, and this lotion is no different! It is thick and rich, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy or tacky. This particular product is one of the most highly perfumed lotions out of any of the St Ives lotions I have used! I was surprised at how strong the scent was, I think because this is very flowery when most St Ives lotions are not. I highly recommend you try to find this and take a whiff in store before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very unique smell, I detect multiple different scents in this lotion: coconut, milky, slightly musky, brown sugar, tropical (I guess the orchid?). It fades to a nice subtle version of the initial, very strong scent. I don&#x27;t feel the need to wear perfume when I put this on, which would make it a perfect summer scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this particular scent so I won&#x27;t be reordering, but I hope my input helps you in your decision!</li>
    <li> This has a great smell that I love, not too intoxicating. It also rubs in well and makes my skin feel softer after first use.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a cheap lotion. It moisturizes better than some other brands that are 5X the price. I love the light orchid fragrance but I also own several other fragrances from St. Ives. This is truly non-greasy but yet your skin will feel so. . . .soft that you won&#x27;t believe it. St. Ives is the only lotion I use.  I am a fan of St. Ives products and I use other products they produce. St. Ives is a name you can trust. Don&#x27;t let the low price keep you from purchasing their products. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> great smell . leaves my skin super soft all day.. does wonders on my skin.. not a greasy&lt;br /&gt; feel.. smooth milky.. just very soft</li>
    <li> This lotion is quickly absorbs by your skin leaving it soft and hydrated; the scent of cocunut and white orquids is super</li>
    <li> I like using this product.  It feels great on my skin and the fragrance is appealing.  I use it daily and like the results I have seen so far.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this lotion!  It is thick and creamy, it really feels good to apply.  It takes a little work to get rubbed all the way in, but I enjoy the process.  The fragrance is light and distinct, and lasts more than a day.  Literally, if I put this on after the shower on Monday morning, I catch wafts of it on Tuesday.  It also makes a good lubricant for massages, although it rubs in a little too quickly in that case!  ;)  I wish it came in a family-sized bottle.</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell delicious but leaves my skin feeling soft all day after quickly absorbing into my skin.</li>
    <li> Came on time, no damages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price. Plan to getting some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;saves me a trip to CVS.</li>
    <li> St Ives makes great products, they always have and always will.  This stuff works and I&#x27;d highly recomend any St Ives product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. Smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> Purchased as filler item for free shipping. Not bad for price, but would pick up from local stores for the same price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion, and St. Ives is one of my favorite brands. It smells really good and it absorbs nicely without leaving your skin feeling greasy. Honestly, my legs have never been nicer than they are when I use this lotion on them every day. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another lotion again.</li>
    <li> The SMELL is AMAZING! It is not greasy. It is really thick which is what I love about it. It feels like it really stays on and continues to moisturize so I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes nicely, but takes about 5 minutes to fully absorb if you put 2 or more layers on. I like the smell, the dispenser is great and also affordable. Beats lots of other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. Leaves my skin baby soft.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product with a light scent .. It&#x27;s not oily but on the other hand its a bit thin as in watery</li>
    <li> Love Coconut Milk lotion from St. Ives, leaves my caramel winter dry skin feelng like butter baby :))  I recommend this product if you have dry skin and you need some moisture.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, not very moisturizing, though.  A bit watery.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It is non-oily so you can put it on near your eyes and face.  I like its smell too.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my wife. She absolutely loves it. Fantastic. Not too thick or too thin.</li>
    <li> This is a very rich but not greasy lotion. It does smell exactly like it is described. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years, for daily skin moisterizing, as well as a skin fade red spot that I have on my cheek. Can&#x27;t find this particular product in stores, so this was a lifesaver, finding it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome. I just love the smell of Coconut Milk &amp; Orchid together.  It really moisturizes your skin leaving it so soft too the touch. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> LOVE, hard to find in stores...great fragrance...absorbs nicely</li>
    <li> I bought this at a drugstore after I had spent 20 bucks on a crappy Kiss my Face peach lotion. Kis my Face can kiss my ass! I was so unhappy with the lotion (smell changed, lotion curdled, did not absorb at all!) but I had all ready spent my budget so I just grabbed this St Ives cream for the value. I figured it can&#x27;t be any worse than the KMF. I was so surprised and delighted when I started using it! It comes out thick and silky but absorbs so quickly and leaves my skin smooth and supple. The smell is nice and light. It doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut to me and it is not flowery or strong. And the smell doesn&#x27;t change over time like the KMF did. It takes me about 4 pumps to do my whole body (2 when I&#x27;m in a rush). Even though it is a thick cream it absorbs in a flash and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; which is great cause I am always late in the mornings and have exactly 60 seconds to lotion up and throw on my clothes. There is a lot of product for the price and I see this stuff lasting for quite a few months. I am very happy with my purchase from St Ives and will definetly buy it again! If you are not sure about buying this for the price it is worth taking a chance. It is very unlikely that you will not like it.</li>
    <li> Great lotion works well on dry skin.  Great soft scent. However after hundreds of pumps, I can still not get the pump to work. Very inconvienent.</li>
    <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work, and YES THAT&#x27;S HUGE, BECAUSE HOW THE HELL ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO ACCESS THE PRODUCT?? I have to open the bottle and stick my fingers to get it now. No. Just no. I think the problem is not with the pump, but that the consistency of the lotion makes it unable to be pumped out. It needs to be converted to a squeeze bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the lotion is okay, very rich and moisturizing without being greasy. It also makes my skin very soft. The scent is great too, but a little too strong. I wish it is stronger on coconuty smells rather than orchid ones, because orchid tends to be very overpowering and feminine, while coconut is soothing and calming. But that is just personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: i love how thick the lotion is; really gives the bang for your buck. The scent is pleasant too, now that i&#x27;m used to it. I&#x27;ve poured the lotion into a jar that  used to hold lotion that i&#x27;ve used up, and it&#x27;s great. However, st.ives still needs to convert the packaging to a squeeze bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion. It moisturizers well, but I would suggest putting it on while you are still damp from bathing. I find that it absorbs better and you don&#x27;t get that greasy feel like you do if you put it on dry skin. I&#x27;ve noticed some people hate the scent. Orchids do not have a scent so companies have to create a scent that they feel will go with that flower, if t did have a scent. Unfortunatly, it can smell awful and artificial. I do not find their version of an orchid that bad, I&#x27;ve smelled way worse interpretations. I like this particular lotion though for the coconut milk as it is a good moisturizer</li>
    <li> Nice inexpensive body lotion.  Not greasy and smells soft and sweet</li>
    <li> My Niece and her two daughters are thrilled their Christmas surprise. Amazon&#x27;s customer service helped me with this deliverly by 12/24/2012 Christmas eve&#x27; A family with no hope for the holiday are so happy today&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Love the way it makes my skin feel. This is an all-over body lotion. It&#x27;ll also help clear up your skin. Put some on after the shower (that&#x27;s my ritual). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> Been using St. Yves for years, no chemicals, natural ingredients most importantly for using the company does not test on animals and no animal ingredients.</li>
    <li> The St.Ives lotions are my all-time favorites and have been using them for years.  This particular one has a very strong and unique odor that some people might love, others might hate.  You might want to smell it at a retail store before ordering online.  Other St.ive&#x27;s body lotions that I ordered got 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to apply as it doesn&#x27;t stay white on your skin until you rub and rub it in.  It also has a nice scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite body lotion.  It smells so good, and it leaves hands and skin so smooth and refreshed in our dry climate.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion. Use it on my face as well. Keeps my skin nice and soft. They need a body wash of this!</li>
    <li> I guess I like the scent, I would describe it as sort of baby powdery...and the lightest floral. It smells nice, but I could think of a million things that I&#x27;d like better. It does seem to be a nice lotion, moisturizes well enough. I like it, especially for the price and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much thinner than the other St. Ives Collagen lotion I usually use. The scent is ok. Not overbearing, but my husband doesn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> this is a nice clean &amp; refreshing smell of coconut &amp; orchid extract. the density is fine. it serves its purpose</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on your skin and absorbs nicely. Has a great smell to it also</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item . Smell nice and make skin soft. Use it every day . Try it worth the money</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the money. Thick but not too thick and smells good.  You cannot lose if you buy St. Ives lotion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter and time for moisturizing -- I have always liked St. Ives products, but this scent wasn&#x27;t really for me. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a giant tub of it, but I hope to finish it this season.</li>
    <li> I love using coconut oil beauty products but all the lotions I&#x27;ve tried were hard in the bottle and you would have to put the bottle in hot water to sort of melt it so it would come out of the bottle.  This one is different.  It comes out of the bottle nicely and feels so good on my skin.  It smells nice and is so moisturing.  I also love the body wash.  They are both my favorites now.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion - it smells amazing!  It goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  Plus it&#x27;s hypoallergenic and safe for people with sensitive skin.  I love that because I was getting tired of only using unscented lotions!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it is a great scent - not too much coconut (which I love anyway though) and some floral. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I wanted a not very expensive lotion, that I could use daily, that didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; (so, absorbed well) but felt like it had hydrated my skin (not feel dry within 12-24 hours) This did all of those things for me. I live in a dryish area, hot dry summer, cold windy winters. I have average skin I think, and this seems to work nicely. Some people in the comments complained about the scent being too strong. The women in my family LOVE bath and body works, talk about heavy scent! So compared to those, this is very mild. It has a light scent, that someone would have to be practically licking you to discern. Bath and body works always seemed to make me greasy/sticky feeling. A couple minutes after application, I don&#x27;t feel this lotion at all, I just also don&#x27;t feel like I have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion on a whim, but I am absolutely in love with the feel, the light scent and the cost! What a bargain! I adore it and will continue to use this as long as I can find it. I haven&#x27;t given St. Ives a thought in years, but it appears they&#x27;ve really revamped their products. This one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion scent but pump was damaged in arrival</li>
    <li> My mom loved it. I bought her a lot of random things for Mothers Day and this was one of them. In her line of work she&#x27;s constantly washing her hands so she keeps this at her desk. She loves the moisture and non greasy feel. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is no longer a NON ANIMAL TESTING product, which breaks my heart as i loved the coconut/orchid lotion. Its really hard to fin a product that you love and now the search for a new product has began.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend who specifically asked for this brand of body lotion and I decided to get this scented one for her. I know, risky, but one has to live. Anyways, I love the scent on her and her skin feels silky smooth, not like my hairy ex-girlfriend</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this location and the scent is amazing for summer. It&#x27;s not too overwhelming of a coconut scent because of the bit of the floral scent.  I have found that this formula is a bit irritating on severely dry skin.  I think I may have developed mild eczema, which fragrance in lotions can irritate.  Too bad because I really enjoy this formula and scent.  I tried the oatmeal version too and the fragrance can irritate my dry patches.</li>
