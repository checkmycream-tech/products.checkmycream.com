      <li>I think this really suitable for short hairs.</li>
      <li>The iron is narrow with curved edges making it great for styling hair straight or curling/ waving.</li>
      <li>This is a 3/4 inch iron,works as well as my chi,but I wanted a smaller iron for travel and to get closer to my roots ,great Lil iron,heats up fast,no issues with having to do multiple passes ,I have coarse,bleached hair ,does the job,will purchase a pro tools again</li>

      <li>I have long thick curly hair and it works great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m that type of person that loves to get a new straighter every 3 months or so, BUT this product blew me away!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller than my full sized flat iron, but it has rounded edges which I love for the style that I have now.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair very shiny and heats up in seconds plus price was unbeatable...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>

      <li>it makes my hair soft and straight</li>
      <li>Not only is it cheap but it is almost as good as those expensive straighteners.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me.  </li>

<li> well I recently bought a 2&#x27; purple flat iron from remmington</li>
<li> I was a bit skeptical since it was so cheap.</li>
<li> Those with long hair may consider an iron with wider plates.</li>
<li> though for what i spent on it, it could have been a bit bigger.</li>
<li> This flat iron is very small, but works extremely well; I only need to run the iron down my hair once to get it sleek and straight.</li>
<li> just wish they&#x27;d have put more settings on it. :(</li>
<li> I have tried curling my hair with other straighteners.</li>
<li> This would be too small for long hair.</li>
<li> This is not your average straightener.  </li>
<li> it just goes up to a little over 400 degrees.</li>
<li> I can look past it</li>
<li> i&#x27;m just sad because of the single heat setting on it.  </li>
<li> My hair isn&#x27;t thick at all</li>
<li> It straightens your hair so perfectly ( NO JOKE )!</li>

    <li> Great product, good price</li>
    <li> Just the right size?...I have RA and this makes it so much easier to do my hair.  Very light weight.</li>
    <li> I love this so much:)</li>
    <li> My wife likes it... that is all you need to know!  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is smaller and does just as good of a job as her older Chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that she did like it... I figured that she would beat me up to get her another Chi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was awesome too... no complaints here!</li>
    <li> This ceramic styler is as good as any 100$ or more styler I&#x27;ve ever used I would buy one again without even thinking it .</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned. Just so you know, it has no temperature control. It has a swivel cord and a great purple sparkly finish. The size is perfect for my shoulder length, fine hair. I can totally overlook that the Twilight movie logo is printed on it.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very shiny and heats up in seconds plus price was unbeatable...a must have product if a twi fan!</li>
    <li> i have had alot of strighteners but this one is my favorite..it works fast and it works great..it dont pull my hair with it..it glides through my hair and it really works great..i have had this scence it came out.i would say sbout 3 years ago give or take maybe longer but i dont know..it still works just like it did when i just bought it..this is a wonderfull hair sraightener and i paid alot more then the price on here but its an awesome alteritive for the chi and all the other exspresive ones..but no were near as pricy..i love it and i will buy a new one when mine gets worn out..IF it does lol ..this is very durable and 100% worth buying</li>
    <li> Saw my friend buy this item a year back in one of the malls in Dubai, UAE. once she started to use it, i could see a big difference in her straightened hair and the most she loves doing are the natural looking curls with it. it works wonders!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really like how fast it is and convenient with its size and it brings out perfect straightening along with nice natural wavy curls.&lt;br /&gt;what i do not like is its temperature is too high. up to 410. so definitely use heating resistance spray to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however everytime i use it, i just love it.&lt;br /&gt;would suggest it to girls who need quick hair for office or parties. either way its perfect for styling too!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is very small, but works extremely well; I only need to run the iron down my hair once to get it sleek and straight. It&#x27;s travel-size, so it&#x27;s perfect for traveling and it&#x27;s a pretty dark purple. I definately recommend this flat iron to anyone who likes to wear their hair straight and for those who love twilight! ^-^</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the sellers fault (not to my knowledge) but the heat plate was tiny and it&#x27;s no use for me. I tried to return it but never got any response as to how to go about that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m that type of person that loves to get a new straighter every 3 months or so, BUT this product blew me away!! At first, I wanted tis straightener because it TWILIGHT, but once I have tired it myself it was amazing. Like honestly, this straightener is by far the best one our there!! It straightens your hair so perfectly ( NO JOKE )! I recommended you guys buying this if you want your hair soft, straight, and perfect !!</li>
    <li> i just got it last night and it&#x27;s soo cute and cool.  i&#x27;m surprised that it was even in stock at the local store where i got it, by the way.  the size of the plates is pretty good.  though for what i spent on it, it could have been a bit bigger. just saying.  anyway,  there aren&#x27;t any heat settings on it which was kind of a let down.  it just goes up to a little over 400 degrees. over all i like it.  i&#x27;m just sad because of the single heat setting on it.  the pretty purple is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;my hair looks pretty good from it.  i&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because of the fact i love my hair straightened and this product did hte job as well as my other straightening iron.  just wish they&#x27;d have put more settings on it. :(</li>
    <li> This is a 3/4 inch iron,works as well as my chi,but I wanted a smaller iron for travel and to get closer to my roots ,great Lil iron,heats up fast,no issues with having to do multiple passes ,I have coarse,bleached hair ,does the job,will purchase a pro tools again</li>
    <li> I love how this is small and I could take it every where I could go. I think this really suitable for short hairs. I have easy to curl hair, but with this one I can&#x27;t seem to curl my hair. I have tried curling my hair with other straighteners. But I like the way it straight my hair.</li>
    <li> The iron is narrow with curved edges making it great for styling hair straight or curling/ waving. Those with long hair may consider an iron with wider plates. Nice size fits well in a backpack. Heats quickly and evenly. Yes the temperature of the iron is very hot and there are no alternate settings. I&#x27;ve dropped the iron on the bathroom floor several times, still works. Overall the product is works very well and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just got this product this morning and I already love it !Not only is it cheap but it is almost as good as those expensive straighteners. Heats up quite quickly Id say 15 seconds or so. MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> I love it because it&#x27;s purple and it straightens my hair exactly how I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall is the straightener pulls on the hair and is pretty small.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, it was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I used to go to the hair salon once a week, as is customary in the Dominican Republic, and since I bought this iron, I&#x27;ve never again stepped foot in it. It manages my hair perfectly, way better than a blower, and faster too! Now I can wash my hair as frequently as I wish. I didn&#x27;t have time before to go to the beauty parlor, since I&#x27;m always working and on the run... now I don&#x27;t need it!</li>
    <li> I am not a Twilight fan by any means at all. But I saw a you tube video on how to style short hair and the girl used his iron. I was a bit skeptical since it was so cheap. But it&#x27;s perfect for my short hair!! It&#x27;s smaller than my full sized flat iron, but it has rounded edges which I love for the style that I have now. This would be too small for long hair. But for medium to short, this is perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought my first twilight straightener about 4 or 5 years ago and it went out about 3 months ago. It heats up fast makes my hair shiny and less frizzy. I have long thick curly hair and it works great! Once my first one went out I tried other straighteners but none could top this one, so happy to get my second one! I can look past it being twilight (:</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron! Really great price and gets my hair straight in a hurry</li>
    <li> My favorite Flat Irons!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Pro Beauty Tools Twilight Edition products.  I own almost all of them.  This is not your average straightener.  Does the job with ease.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> oh my gosh i love this - its kinda small but makes up for in the styling. it makes my hair soft and straight and i have the most uncontrollable hair possible</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me.  I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t adjust the heat either. My hair isn&#x27;t thick at all and I still have to go over it three times before it is straight.</li>
    <li> Actually lasted a decent amount of time (2 years)&lt;br /&gt;At first I was hesitant, (oh gosh twilight ughh) but then I read a lot of good review on it, sooo i bought it. I really works great and it still works well well I recently bought a 2&#x27; purple flat iron from remmington</li>
