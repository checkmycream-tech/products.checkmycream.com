      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>It works just as good as the Toppik product but is so much more affordable!</li>
      <li>Very good hair building fibers and too cheap for the quality....</li>
      <li>Excellent replacement!!!!....color was perfect and I believe the coverage and cling of the fibers to the hair is the same or better than the original !!</li>
      <li>This works wonderfully to fill my containers of Toppik Hair Fibers at a much cheaper cost.  </li>
      <li>As good of quality as Caboki at a MUCH better value.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this kind of product for about three years now.</li>
      <li>I love it, love it, love it.</li>
      <li>The amount of product you get is fantastic for the price!</li>
      <li>and I think this is better than toppik and Samson fibers.</li>
      <li>Stays put better than toppik, also a lot more affordable.</li>
      <li>Able to fill my 25gram Caboki</li>
      <li>It adheres way better and the color matching is also better.</li>
      <li>Works great at a reasonable cost</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more of this stuff.</li>
      <li>Iam pleased with purchase</li>
      <li>fibers(like most refill kits</li>
      <li>I am super satisfied and will be a customer for life!</li>
      <li>This was some pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>These fibers are more fine, and seemingly powdery, than Toppik.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the awesome product, guys - I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more!</li>
      <li>I thought Wow, How nice!</li>
      <li>Nobody knows I have a huge bald spot.  </li>
      <li>I dont know what happened to my original review, I gave this 4 or 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I prefer the longer, coarser Toppik fibers, which seem more like your real hair when applied correctly.  </li>
      <li>This item was for my wife, she said that it was not as good as the regular caboki  </li>
      <li>Not bad at all.</li>
      <li>It shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I wish this would&#x27;ve been available when I first began using Toppik.</li>
      <li>Sometimes we use Caboki alone on casual, no need to  impress, staying around the house kind of days and use the  Toppik alone for more important out and about kind of days.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the trade off for the price &amp; my solution has been mixing name brand with this.</li>
      <li>I am so glad to have found it and wont have to pay nearly 60.00 every time I need to refill my container.  </li>
      <li>These fibers work just fine, provide realistic coverage; you can use your old Toppik bottle to shake them on your head; the texture just seems more powdery.</li>
      <li>This stuff blends right in</li>
      <li>However, if I apply hairspray and give it a more wet look, it blends in just fine.</li>
      <li>Economic &amp; does the job adequately.</li>
      <li>This is so much more economical, I would definitely continue to purchase this product.</li>
      <li>smells funny</li>
      <li>Just to make sure it was actually as advertised and not keratin</li>
      <li>The particles are more dense and visibly larger.</li>
      <li>and you get twice as much of it!</li>
      <li>Before I was a bit skeptical based on other reviews, I can affirm this works great, feels great and you cant beat the customer service.</li>
      <li>container, I was very happy to find this 50-gram refill by Westwood Research Labortories, which charges less than other non-Toppik providers.</li>
      <li>In my original review I said that the dark brown is super dark more like a blk brown if your ok with that.</li>
      <li>After reading the positive reviews about this, I thought it was legit.</li>
      <li>However, I find these fibers are just as good if not slightly better than Toppik, and much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I expected a better quality fiber.</li>
      <li>The only reason for me giving three stars is because the color is not as close to the original brand name product I use (Toppik).</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I just poured it into an older bottle I use from one of their competitors.  </li>
      <li>Great not as messy  as other.</li>
      <li>I havent had such nice professional treatment like this in such a long time.</li>
      <li>Sometimes we use Caboki as the first layer and Toppik as the second, outer layer.  </li>
      <li>Too light for dark brown.</li>
      <li>) I hit it with a blow dryer for about 30 seconds and, to my delight, my crown was still completely covered.</li>
      <li>I can refill my bottles multiple times, get the same exact results, for a quarter of the price.</li>
      <li>i will go back to the regular stuff next time, it did a decent job though,</li>
      <li>actually a more natural black shade, if you&#x27;re in between a dark brown and a black.</li>

<li> I will be using this for a long time.  </li>
<li> the fibers stay in the hair even under heavy sweating and your thinning areas remain thick and full...</li>
<li> However, the quality is not equal to other brands.</li>
<li> I got my hair fibers back in the medium brown in less than a week.</li>
<li> I just loaded this stuff up in my empty Caboki container and gave it a go</li>
<li> One person said the Dark Brown wasn&#x27;t as dark as Toppik</li>
<li> I caught this too late when I saw myself in a mirror outside.</li>
<li> It also matches well with dark brown hair.</li>
<li> bottle 2.5 times at half the price.</li>
<li> Toppik &amp;#34;Dark Brown&amp;#34; is slightly darker than the product I ordered.</li>
<li> The Black, incidently, is not jet black, like the Toppik Black...</li>
<li> After it has been applied, your head will have the look of someone taking a melting black crayon to your scalp.</li>
<li> I purchased black, to mix, because of the comment, but didn&#x27;t need to do so.  </li>
<li> an is a little to black from the caboki product again</li>
<li> Toppik and Samson had a dusty white look to it with the dark brown.</li>
<li> I am ordering a lighter color to mix with the darker color for I am aging and getting a little gray.</li>
<li> The one I received seems to be a little lighter which shows up in my hair.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed to find that it isn&#x27;t nearly as effective in covering thinning/balding patches.  </li>
<li> AVOID THIS PRODUCT and spend the extra $ on the brands that have a name behind them to defend.</li>
<li> only last about 6.5 hours before it starts looking bad.</li>
<li> I tried one other hair fiber product, that was significantly worse than Toppik, so I was a bit Leary.</li>
<li> Caboki lasted at least 8 hours</li>
<li> You will notice an almost dusty look when using but hardly noticeable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works just like topik. It even came in a similar container to topik not in a bag.</li>
    <li> Just like Toppik Hair Building Fibers but with tremendously low price.  One person said the Dark Brown wasn&#x27;t as dark as Toppik but I find it to be too close in color to warrant a comment.  I purchased black, to mix, because of the comment, but didn&#x27;t need to do so.  The Black, incidently, is not jet black, like the Toppik Black...actually a more natural black shade, if you&#x27;re in between a dark brown and a black.</li>
    <li> Iam pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> Great not as messy  as other.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for the price. I&#x27;ve been buying this kind of product for about three years now. I&#x27;ve spend a LOT of money where I didn&#x27;t need to. If you have a hair loss or thinning problem, buy this. The amount of product you get is fantastic for the price!</li>
    <li> Just as good as Toppick at a fraction of the cost.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> smells funny an is a little to black from the caboki product again I will not reorder</li>
    <li> Good for price and works great!!</li>
    <li> Excellent for my bald spots. I use this every day around my edges and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Economic &amp; does the job adequately. However, the quality is not equal to other brands. You will notice an almost dusty look when using but hardly noticeable. I think it&#x27;s worth the trade off for the price &amp; my solution has been mixing name brand with this.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive alternative!</li>
    <li> This product made me sick, and I had to return it.</li>
    <li> This was some pretty good stuff. I just poured it into an older bottle I use from one of their competitors.  I couldn&#x27;t get 50 grams of this stuff at this price from anyone else.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews about this, I thought it was legit. I bought this pack at the same time I bought a name brand counterpart. When I ran out of the name brand stuff I switched to this. Dramatically different. The particles are more dense and visibly larger. They also clump together upon application and over the course of the day will begin to fall out in clumps. I tried it for a couple days before throwing it in the trash. After it has been applied, your head will have the look of someone taking a melting black crayon to your scalp. I caught this too late when I saw myself in a mirror outside. AVOID THIS PRODUCT and spend the extra $ on the brands that have a name behind them to defend. This stuff is disgusting.</li>
    <li> Too light for dark brown. Disappointed with purchase, period.</li>
    <li> It works just as good as the Toppik product but is so much more affordable!</li>
    <li> I love it, love it, love it. Its so convenient, every time my bottle gets low I just refill it. I wish this would&#x27;ve been available when I first began using Toppik. The only thing I have against Toppik is when I lean my head against the back of the sofa it comes off on the fabric and at night it comes off on my pillow case. If anyone has a solution for this please let me know.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a cost saving alternative to Toppik, which I use on my 12 year old daughter who suffers from a very bad case of trichotillomania.  I was very disappointed to find that it isn&#x27;t nearly as effective in covering thinning/balding patches.  I&#x27;ve started using Toppik and Caboki together.  Sometimes we use Caboki as the first layer and Toppik as the second, outer layer.  Sometimes we use Caboki alone on casual, no need to  impress, staying around the house kind of days and use the  Toppik alone for more important out and about kind of days.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive but one package</li>
    <li> The results not were goods. I lista my money . And my time, maybe  this  product is  fake. Just not worked.</li>
    <li> Very good hair building fibers and too cheap for the quality....</li>
    <li> Finally, an alternative to Caboki that uses the same hair clinging fiber! I just loaded this stuff up in my empty Caboki container and gave it a go and it works perfect. Just to make sure it was actually as advertised and not keratin fibers(like most refill kits) I hit it with a blow dryer for about 30 seconds and, to my delight, my crown was still completely covered. Thanks for the awesome product, guys - I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more!</li>
    <li> Works Great on my thinning hair.♥ I am ordering a lighter color to mix with the darker color for I am aging and getting a little gray. GREAT price on bulk!</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully to fill my containers of Toppik Hair Fibers at a much cheaper cost.  I am so glad to have found it and wont have to pay nearly 60.00 every time I need to refill my container.  I cant tell the difference between this product and the Toppik.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to the name brands. It is just as resistant to sweat, water, and wind. It also matches well with dark brown hair. I will say that it is a bit messier to apply, but not a lot. Overall, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Itz great it does what I need it to do!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ordering more of this stuff. The price is great and I think this is better than toppik and Samson fibers. It adheres way better and the color matching is also better. Toppik and Samson had a dusty white look to it with the dark brown. This stuff blends right in can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing any.</li>
    <li> This item was for my wife, she said that it was not as good as the regular caboki  refill i will go back to the regular stuff next time, it did a decent job though,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Toppik for years, and wanted to find something cheaper. I tried one other hair fiber product, that was significantly worse than Toppik, so I was a bit Leary. However, I find these fibers are just as good if not slightly better than Toppik, and much cheaper. The bag contains enough product to refill the container several times.</li>
    <li> I dont know what happened to my original review, I gave this 4 or 5 stars. The product is just as good if not better than the expensive caboki I have bought and you get twice as much of it! In my original review I said that the dark brown is super dark more like a blk brown if your ok with that. After leaving my review I got a call from the Westwood Labs, and they wanted me 100% happy and offered to exchange the hair fibers for a lighter shade. I thought Wow, How nice! I got my hair fibers back in the medium brown in less than a week. I havent tried the color, I am sure it will be perfect.  Before I was a bit skeptical based on other reviews, I can affirm this works great, feels great and you cant beat the customer service. I am super satisfied and will be a customer for life! I havent had such nice professional treatment like this in such a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day...</li>
    <li> For the price, you cannot beat this deal. The quality of the fibers are the same. The only reason for me giving three stars is because the color is not as close to the original brand name product I use (Toppik). Toppik &amp;#34;Dark Brown&amp;#34; is slightly darker than the product I ordered. The one I received seems to be a little lighter which shows up in my hair. However, if I apply hairspray and give it a more wet look, it blends in just fine.</li>
    <li> Nobody knows I have a huge bald spot.  In fact, they don&#x27;t even believe me when I tell them I do.  I will be using this for a long time.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> As good of quality as Caboki at a MUCH better value.  Able to fill my 25gram Caboki bottle 2.5 times at half the price.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
    <li> Works great!  Will purchase again... only wish you could figure out a way to keep it from running (if I get caught in the rain) (it rains a lot in FL)</li>
    <li> Since Toppik charges an unreasonable price in my opinion for a 1 oz. container, I was very happy to find this 50-gram refill by Westwood Research Labortories, which charges less than other non-Toppik providers. It&#x27;s also &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was spending 30 bucks on a tiny, half-filled, bottled of Tropik. I can refill my bottles multiple times, get the same exact results, for a quarter of the price. It shipped quickly. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Not the color desired</li>
    <li> Not bad at all. I have used every fiber out there I think.  It is a solid performer.</li>
    <li> Shortly after placing my order I received an email telling me that they were out of the bags to ship the fibers and that I would be getting the bottles at no extra charge. Just as the email stated I received two bottles and the product works well, not too coarse and spreads well. Good for the money.</li>
    <li> Have ordered a couple of times now.  Works great at a reasonable cost</li>
    <li> These fibers are more fine, and seemingly powdery, than Toppik.  I prefer the longer, coarser Toppik fibers, which seem more like your real hair when applied correctly.  These fibers work just fine, provide realistic coverage; you can use your old Toppik bottle to shake them on your head; the texture just seems more powdery. This is so much more economical, I would definitely continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement!!!!....color was perfect and I believe the coverage and cling of the fibers to the hair is the same or better than the original !!the fibers stay in the hair even under heavy sweating and your thinning areas remain thick and full...just pat it into your hair when applying and use some hair spray to finish......very happy with this product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Stays put better than toppik, also a lot more affordable.</li>
    <li> Applied than Caboki - it is sprinkled on hair, not rubbed in like Caboki - only last about 6.5 hours before it starts looking bad. Caboki lasted at least 8 hours</li>
    <li> Great product. Will buy again!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Not even close to cabooki I expected a better quality fiber.</li>
