      <li>They are not quite as FIRM as I would like, they are better than others I have seen.</li>
      <li>It is not as firm as what they used to be and after 4 to 5 uses the toothbrush feels more like it has soft bristles.</li>

      <li>I need a firm toothbrush and this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Since my husband prefers firm toothbrushes, it  has been a challenge to find  them so these toothbrushes fit his needs.</li>

<li> After the first few uses, the bristles begin to fatigue,...</li>
<li> These are hard to find, and worth the price.</li>
<li> Toothbrush is an Advanced Design model, as described, BUT this is not the toothbrush pictured - so if you are looking for the original Reach Firm toothbrush, you will be disappointed.</li>
<li> That is unfortunate because I really preferred the older bristle design</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find FIRM toothbrushes, but these are exactly as advertised!  </li>
<li> I love this design as the bristles are firm and sturdy and the angle gets in behind my Molars to reach my Wisdom Teeth!</li>
<li> dentist keeps telling me I should use a softer brush, but when he checks my teeth he says there is no sign of damage from the firm brushes I have been using daily for well over thirty years, so I&#x27;ll keep on using them as long as the companies don&#x27;t improve them all out of existence.</li>
<li> Over the course of several years, I&#x27;ve looked for a firm Toothbrush for my husband Because he&#x27;s a smoker</li>
<li> Careful reading of the text will indicate that fact, but the picture is still misleading.  </li>
<li> Wow, how about a lable that says &amp;#34;warning, Firm toothbrushes are firm and may scrape enamel off your teeth (as well as crud ?)</li>
<li> They are very hard to find where I live.</li>
<li> Just what I wanted (firm tooth brushes) , and you can&#x27;t buy them in the stores due to product liability issues , thanks to our broken tort system and and over-zealous lawyers.</li>
<li> other than that just plain brushes</li>
<li> Just what we wanted, and thank you for having these for sale, I couldn&#x27;t find a toothbrush with firm bristles anywhere</li>
<li> I just wish it was broader and didn&#x27;t narrow towards the tip.  </li>
<li> Almost forgot how it felt to use a firm toothbrush until i found you all.</li>
<li> I like a really firm tooth brush.</li>
<li> I cant find the firm ones in the  stores anymore</li>
<li> Some 15 or so years ago dentists started recommending against using firm bristle toothbrushes.  </li>
<li> some people don&#x27;t like FIRM, but I do!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m REALLY hard on toothbrushes.</li>
<li> I gave them 5 stars because I could not find them in stores with the hard bristle</li>
<li> These are hard to find in the store</li>
<li> Time will tell if this is truly a quality toothbrush because the poor ones soften up after a few weeks.  </li>
<li> not the real firm bristles expected.&lt;br /&gt;New</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m really tired of companies</li>
<li> Very difficult to find firm toothbrushes in stores.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a great &amp;#34;hard bristiled&amp;#34; toothbrush, you can&#x27;t find in ANY of the store&#x27;s any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a &amp;#34;hard bristiled&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Over the course of several years, I&#x27;ve looked for a firm Toothbrush for my husband Because he&#x27;s a smoker and I have not  been able to find one until now!  He love it because it works better than a soft brush. I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> love the produt just what i ordered hard ot find this rype in the stpre thanks again love it  thanks</li>
    <li> Toothbrush is okay, as far as toothbrushes go. Wanted something more firmer, but the order for the smokers brush wouldn&#x27;t go through, so settled for these. Better than the soft ones in the stores.</li>
    <li> Reach toothbrushes were Soft, not Firm as I wanted and expected.  Unsatisfactory.</li>
    <li> I need a firm toothbrush and this fit the bill. Shipping was timely and product as described. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price too!</li>
    <li> PERFECT!  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find FIRM toothbrushes, but these are exactly as advertised!  I&#x27;ve ordered them in the past, and will do so again (as soon as I&#x27;m done with this review:).  They arrived promptly, and put smiles back on faces needing them (smiles AND toothbrushes)!!</li>
    <li> Some 15 or so years ago dentists started recommending against using firm bristle toothbrushes.  (&amp;#34;Can hurt your gums.&amp;#34;)  After the first few uses, the bristles begin to fatigue,...but the firm lasts much longer.  These are hard to find, and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrushes.  They are not quite as FIRM as I would like, they are better than others I have seen.</li>
    <li> Some people are not picky about toothbrushes but I am. These are hard to find in the store so I was thrilled to receive a 3 pack bonus when I ordered the 2 pack.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I can find these toothbrushes. They are very hard to find where I live. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I love this firm toothbrush so much that I buy it online. The only toothbrush that leaves my mouth feeling clean. Enough said</li>
    <li> not the real firm bristles expected.&lt;br /&gt;New advance design sold at any stores now...disappointing! save your money or buy at stores..directly</li>
    <li> Toothbrush is an Advanced Design model, as described, BUT this is not the toothbrush pictured - so if you are looking for the original Reach Firm toothbrush, you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find firm toothbrushes in stores. (Dentists don&#x27;t recommend them)  Now I know how to easily obtain them</li>
    <li> I love this design as the bristles are firm and sturdy and the angle gets in behind my Molars to reach my Wisdom Teeth!</li>
    <li> They set me 3!! I got 1 for free!</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t stop manufacturing this toothbrush!  It is fantastic - does the job in half the time as a soft brush.  My teeth feel smooth and clean.  And my breath is fresh.  I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Love the reach firm toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> It is just OK. It is not as firm as what they used to be and after 4 to 5 uses the toothbrush feels more like it has soft bristles.</li>
    <li> Time will tell if this is truly a quality toothbrush because the poor ones soften up after a few weeks.  Initial stiffness is very good and the shape of the brush is good.  I just wish it was broader and didn&#x27;t narrow towards the tip.  I do think the extra-long bristes on the tip are a nice touch though.</li>
    <li> Almost forgot how it felt to use a firm toothbrush until i found you all. I think they&#x27;re GREAT!!!  John</li>
    <li> some people don&#x27;t like FIRM, but I do!  I have 4 toothbrushes and I rotate them, so 4 usually last me a whole year.  Every year I buy 4 more.  PLEASE don&#x27;t stop making them, Reach!</li>
    <li> received quickly and as described</li>
    <li> very good quality because we can&#x27;t get firm toothbrushex in our area unless they just stop making firnm tooth brushes</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted (firm tooth brushes) , and you can&#x27;t buy them in the stores due to product liability issues , thanks to our broken tort system and and over-zealous lawyers. Wow, how about a lable that says &amp;#34;warning, Firm toothbrushes are firm and may scrape enamel off your teeth (as well as crud ?)</li>
    <li> These are very basic, nothing especial. I gave them 5 stars because I could not find them in stores with the hard bristle so 5 stars for having them..... other than that just plain brushes</li>
    <li> I like a really firm tooth brush. this is more like medium to me but I do like the full head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m REALLY hard on toothbrushes. I basically scrub my teeth and my brushes wear out in just a couple of weeks. These ones last the longest out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried. It feels good to brush with a firm bristle. I also have no cavities so what I&#x27;m doing must be working.</li>
    <li> Just what we wanted, and thank you for having these for sale, I couldn&#x27;t find a toothbrush with firm bristles anywhere</li>
    <li> Great deal on the tooth brushes I like. I cant find the firm ones in the  stores anymore so this is awesome</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re toothbrushes, geez!</li>
    <li> Since my husband prefers firm toothbrushes, it  has been a challenge to find  them so these toothbrushes fit his needs. He likes them.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the purchase. Received in a timely fashion. Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;And I would tell a friend about your store.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer pointed out, the model shipped is NOT the model pictured.  It is a newer model with a different bristle design.  That is unfortunate because I really preferred the older bristle design and I really don&#x27;t like the feel of the \\&quot;tongue cleaner\\&quot; added to the newer model, but apparently Reach has \\&quot;improved\\&quot; their advanced design and the older, pictured design is no longer available.  (I&#x27;m really tired of companies \\&quot;improving\\&quot; designs that I am already perfectly happy with.  I guess I&#x27;m just getting old.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had noticed the earlier review before ordering.  Also NOTE that the price is for 1 package of 2 BRUSHES, not 2 packages of 2 brushes, as shown in the photo.  Careful reading of the text will indicate that fact, but the picture is still misleading.  I&#x27;ll keep the ones I received because I don&#x27;t hold out any hope of finding the older design, the price was OK, the new bristle design is not really bad, and I cannot find a good Firm toothbrush in the stores around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist keeps telling me I should use a softer brush, but when he checks my teeth he says there is no sign of damage from the firm brushes I have been using daily for well over thirty years, so I&#x27;ll keep on using them as long as the companies don&#x27;t improve them all out of existence.</li>
    <li> good toothbrushs. thanks</li>
