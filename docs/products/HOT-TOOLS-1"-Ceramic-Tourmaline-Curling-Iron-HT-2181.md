      <li>Glad I kept my beat-up looking one that get hot.</li>
      <li>Love it; works very well; love the cord as well as the turn off and on botton; heats up fast.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my mid-length hair,the curls last several days.</li>
      <li>Heats up quick.</li>
      <li>The MOST amazing thing that it does is smooth out hair, equal or better to that of a flat iron.</li>
      <li>and it still doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
      <li>Great curls with less damage.</li>
      <li>awesome tool had the other one in gold for many years and it finally stopped so glad to have it back</li>
      <li>I have never seen such amazing results from a curling iron.</li>
      <li>Shipped it to me for free and yet wants me to pay return postage.</li>
      <li>worth it</li>
      <li>I like how they get really hot</li>
      <li>have curly hair which I blow straight then use the curling iron&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up nearly as hot as is stated.</li>
      <li>Holds my hair better than the last curling iron I had.  </li>
      <li>, Gold N Hot from Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>This curling iron heats very fast and heats to a very high temperature.</li>
      <li>Love the ceramic heats very evenly and my curls last all day.</li>
      <li>Love my curlers they were a birthday gift thanks honey heats up quickly &amp; won&#x27;t burn your fingers lil other curlers.</li>
      <li>I love that it has a long cord.</li>
      <li>The Hot Tools hair products are very durable.</li>
      <li>Would certainly buy again.</li>
      <li>Trying to return, but company wants me to pay for postage.</li>
      <li>works like a charm..holds curls very well</li>
      <li>Oh &amp; it heats up fast.</li>
      <li>I always ask my hair stylist what kind of curling iron to get and she always says, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s really a personal preference.&amp;#34; So, I finally just looked at what she was using and ordered it.</li>
      <li>It was VERY easy to use, easier than most curling irons, because of the swiveling knob on the bottom (hard to describe, but it definitely helps.)</li>
      <li>Save your money if you do not have normal, straight hair.</li>
      <li>While trying to curl my hair, since it does not have a good, tight clamp, the outer part of my hair does not get enough heat to hold a curl, and I have tried leaving the hair in the curling iron for 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 5 seconds - I&#x27;ve given it every chance - on every heat level on the curling iron.  </li>
      <li>Also, since it heats up so fast and gets so hot, it&#x27;s a major time saver.  </li>
      <li>All in all a decent iron.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase more HotTools items in the future.</li>
      <li>The last one had a problem with the cord, but they are well worth it.</li>
      <li>I have had the same exact iron for years, and for some reason, this brand new iron doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the last one.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what the problem is with this currling iron, but it is my second one I ordered thinking the first was defective</li>
      <li>There is 2 extra clips included which is much appreciated.  </li>
      <li>As far as softer hair, even heat, I cannot tell a difference.</li>
      <li>They come with new springs since those do go out, but usually by the time that happens (2 years or so) the thing is full of hairspray and needs to be replaced.  </li>
      <li>I will go back to my old tried-N-true</li>
      <li>I only used it 5 times so far</li>
      <li>Gets very hot; works well even on thick hair.</li>

    <li> Great curling iron. Heats up quick. the cord swivels, has temperature settings. All in all a decent iron.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my third one&lt;br /&gt;They seem to last about 18 months&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair which I blow straight then use the curling iron&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever. Perfect for my mid-length hair,the curls last several days.</li>

    <li> One of the best curling irons I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> To be fair, let me tell you my hair type.  I am getting up there in age (50&#x27;s), used to have extremely thick, course hair.  My hair is now thinning. I have owned many, many curling irons, from very expensive to least expensive.  This curling iron just does not do a good job curling my hair.  The clamp does not have enough hold. While trying to curl my hair, since it does not have a good, tight clamp, the outer part of my hair does not get enough heat to hold a curl, and I have tried leaving the hair in the curling iron for 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 5 seconds - I&#x27;ve given it every chance - on every heat level on the curling iron.  As far as softer hair, even heat, I cannot tell a difference. I will go back to my old tried-N-true, Gold N Hot from Sally&#x27;s.  Save your money if you do not have normal, straight hair.</li>
    <li> I love hot tools! This was a great buy!</li>
    <li> works like a charm..holds curls very well</li>
    <li> I am a beginner at using a curling iron and found this one very easy to use. Gets very hot; works well even on thick hair.</li>
    <li> been wanting one of these for a while and finally got it these are amazing curling irons!!! Im really impressed!!!</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. You can&#x27;t go wrong with hot tools products!</li>
    <li> Love it; works very well; love the cord as well as the turn off and on botton; heats up fast.  Gives me the best curls; I even used it to straighten my hair.  Would certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> I have had the same exact iron for years, and for some reason, this brand new iron doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the last one.  I don&#x27;t have any idea why.</li>
    <li> Used for a short time, appears to be of quality.</li>
    <li> The best curling iron ever</li>
    <li> Perfect exactly what I wanted and this is bull when you want a review and you&#x27;re going to dictate how many words my review is? This&#x27;ll be the last one!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what the problem is with this currling iron, but it is my second one I ordered thinking the first was defective and it still doesn&#x27;t get very hot. The best thing about this curling iron is that it has a long cord....that is it.  Glad I kept my beat-up looking one that get hot.</li>
    <li> I have 3 HotTools curling Irons and I love each of them! I will definitely purchase more HotTools items in the future.</li>
    <li> Quality product, great temperature control, rotational handle, good cord length.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the ceramic curling irons. I read somewhere they are better for your hair and I believe it. These curling irons heat evenly and work wonderfully on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Other reviews are spot on - this is a great curling iron. The curls hold for the entire day, or 2 days even! I hate the new wands they came out with, I can&#x27;t figure out how to use them (yeah I&#x27;m a little hair challenged) - but this is an awesome curling iron!</li>
    <li> So far this is a great curling iron.  Works as advertised.  If you follow the heat instructions it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair and leaves it nice and curly.  Love the color and the price was fantastic.  If it lasts more than a year I&#x27;ll be ecstatic.</li>
    <li> Heats and curls perfectly!</li>
    <li> I switched over to this after years of frying my hair with a traditional curling iron. The ceramic coating keeps the iron from sticking and \\&quot;frying\\&quot; your hair. The Hot Tools hair products are very durable. They hold up well, and I have never once had to replace a spring in one of them. The swivel cord works wonderfully to keep you from getting knots in the cord. The rubber tip prevents you from getting burns. These curling irons may be just a tad more expensive than others, but if you want durability and effectiveness, these curling irons are the way to go.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Better priced than in the stores. But I do wish the manufacturer would make it with a automatic shut off.</li>
    <li> This is at least the third one of these curling irons I&#x27;ve purchased.  I like how they get really hot so I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair before curling it.  They come with new springs since those do go out, but usually by the time that happens (2 years or so) the thing is full of hairspray and needs to be replaced.  The last one had a problem with the cord, but they are well worth it.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, I&#x27;m just upset that the purple coloring is coming off!!!  I only used it 5 times so far</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold curls for 2 secs (not hot enough)</li>
    <li> Love the style and grip. Doesn&#x27;t heat up nearly as hot as is stated. Trying to return, but company wants me to pay for postage. I don&#x27;t understand why I need to pay postage on something that is defective from the get-go. Shipped it to me for free and yet wants me to pay return postage.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is amazing I also have the smaller barrel for when I curl my hair in flips. This curling iron heats very fast and heats to a very high temperature. These are the only brand of curling irons that I buy. Love the ceramic heats very evenly and my curls last all day.</li>
    <li> This curling iron curls great.  The curls last longer than with a metal curling iron.  My problem is with the electrical cord.  It shorted out and now has to be in the perfect place to stay on, which can&#x27;t be accomplished very easily when curling your hair..  I don&#x27;t curl my hair that often, maybe once or twice a month with this iron, so I expected it to last longer for the price.</li>
    <li> Love my curlers they were a birthday gift thanks honey heats up quickly &amp; won&#x27;t burn your fingers lil other curlers.</li>
    <li> My go to curling iron.  Heats up nicely and sturdy.</li>
    <li> awesome tool had the other one in gold for many years and it finally stopped so glad to have it back</li>
    <li> I always ask my hair stylist what kind of curling iron to get and she always says, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s really a personal preference.&amp;#34; So, I finally just looked at what she was using and ordered it. Pretty happy with it so far!</li>
    <li> At first it was great then the ceramic coating started to peel</li>
    <li> Great curls with less damage.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the curling iron itself, I am sure it&#x27;s a great one BUT the thing came in the mail 1) poorly packaged 2) looked used! Had spots on it.</li>
