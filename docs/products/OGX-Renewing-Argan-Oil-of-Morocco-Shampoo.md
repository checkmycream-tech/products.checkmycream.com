### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Both shampoos have produced excellent results for my hair.</li>
      <li>I feel I get the best of both worlds.      </li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>I think it is the best, and i am a licensed cosmetoligist</li>
      <li>I did not put any product in it at all and my hair is beautiful.</li>
      <li>The renewing Argan OIl shampoo lathers great, and seems to rinse out while you&#x27;re in the shower.</li>
      <li>I do love it and recommend to get!!</li>
      <li>It moisturizes my hair so nicely!</li>
      <li>&quot; hair isn&#x27;t good.     </li>
      <li>but that is because of the lack of sulfates which is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>Super great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with both of these shampoos.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>smells great and my fine hair is fuller</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s AMAZING</li>
      <li>The no sulfate formula is a nice plus.</li>
      <li>The Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner just smells so nice</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and shiny without using conditioner.</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo and lovely scent.  </li>
      <li>I kept feeling the need to wash my hair more and more.</li>
      <li>i love this product line</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>Anyone who is prone to frizzy hair should be able to relate to this regime or should consider not washing their hair every day as it strips the oil from your hair.    </li>
      <li>I love the Organix Moroccan Argan Oil shampoo.  </li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo out there.</li>
      <li>:)     </li>
      <li>Smooth hair , and nice smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy the full bottles</li>
      <li>It works great for when I blow dry my hair because it keeps more moisture in my hair</li>
      <li>There is another brand of shampoo which has Argan oil in it and even though I truly enjoy it, it&#x27;s not a shampoo</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m left with a shiny head of happily balanced hair.</li>
      <li>Both shampoos smell great, with the fragrances from both shampoos lasting for days.</li>
      <li>The Brazilian Keratin Therapy Shampoo has organic cocoa nut oil, keratin proteins, organic avocado oil, cocoa butter, and is sulfate and sodium free.</li>
      <li>However, products that go down the drain are never meant to be the magic bullet for great hair</li>
      <li>Once I switched to a sulfate free shampoo the very FIRST shampoo I noticed a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I noticed it mostly has positive reviews and thats why I decided to buy it.</li>
      <li>The scent reminds me of soap scent , something like Ivory soap but with a slightly sweet undertone.  </li>
      <li>First thing I love is this shampoo is fresh smelling rather than nutty or sweet.  </li>
      <li>so i can buy twice as much Dove shampoo and conditioner which works way better.</li>
      <li>The first shampoo ever I love so much!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect such quick or amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>and I will be purchasing again in the future, nice scent, hair feels softer</li>
      <li>I love three things about this shampoo and dislike nothing so far.     </li>
      <li>/&gt;After just one use my hair was never so soft, shiny, healthy, and easier to manage.</li>
      <li>It does leave my hair soft and moisturized :)</li>
      <li>The Shampoo is non-stripping and sulfate free and lathers ok even with my hard water thanks to the Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate which is a great substitute for sulfates and it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
      <li>It is reminiscent of baby shampoo and smells very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>The Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo is paraben free and provides natural vitamin E to the hair while protecting the hair from UV damage.</li>
      <li>I have used this several times in hope that I would like it better.</li>
      <li>It helps smooth it out but doesn&#x27;t feel silky, nourished or soft as I imagined.</li>
      <li>This was my first try of this shampoo</li>
      <li>The second thing I love about this shampoo has Argan Oil in it but doesn&#x27;t have so much in it that I start to feel it build up.  </li>
      <li>And both shampoos leave my hair shiny, soft, smooth, and straight.</li>
      <li>However, when you go to comb/blowdry/style your hair, it is completely evident that there is  a lot of residue build up with this shampoo, no matter how much you rinse your hair out in the shower.</li>
      <li>The Shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok tho, but just not what I expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been alternating, depending on my mood, between Organix Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo and Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Shampoos.</li>
      <li>Last but not least is the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free and at a reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>I feel I can use long term because I start to feel like my hair was becoming oily faster than normal.  </li>
      <li>did not find this shampoo any more thicker than the average cream shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free does mean it will not lather up as easily as shampoos with sulfates</li>
      <li>It shipped in 3 days &amp; was in brand new condition!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy or left with a not so clean feeling &amp; it has a soft vanilla smell!</li>
      <li>highly recommend Organix argan oil shampoo if you&#x27;re looking to improve the health of your hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>My hair is softer to the touch and has it&#x27;s normal shine again.</li>
      <li>My Dove Advanced Hair Series Oxygen Moisture Shampoo is empty, so I decided to try something new.</li>
      <li>There are not many shampoos available at your local grocery store which is sulfate free.  </li>
      <li>BUT I cannot live with the scent.  </li>
      <li>And I was soooo looking forward to this new organix line.</li>
      <li>and we as consumers only have an association with lather as clean where others say the later helps to move dirt.</li>
      <li>thick, course, curly hair and the shampoo and conditioner made my hair dry, and full of static.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner do not dry my hair out nor leave too much oil</li>
      <li>would of been a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>I really wish I could return it and get my money back</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair that has a tendency to go haywire in the humidity that is Florida summer.</li>
      <li>This shampoo makes your hair soft and shiney (which is what I was going for).  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised.</li>
      <li>leaves hair soft and maageable.</li>
      <li>Cleans well and leaves my hair soft and shiny without lots of chemicals.</li>
      <li>The only purpose they serve it create lather but these very things can also cause dandruff in some people.  </li>
      <li>My scalp is extremely sensitive to sulfates.</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo for the first time today and as soon as it began to dry</li>
      <li>No tight scalp, no flakes and no overly oily scalp.</li>
      <li>I have thick, coarse hair that tends to dry out and after trying the OGX Coconut Milk shampoo (which smells great, but tended to dry my hair out a bit)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only  used it 3 times in the past week and it has made my hair super heavy, greasy, and my scalp super itchy.</li>
      <li>it made my hair so much frizzier than other cheaper shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells clean and not too heavy in scent but it leaves a fresh scent behind, something my husband enjoys ....</li>
      <li>This product was a little expensive but it smelled good, and I&#x27;ve read about the benefits of argan oil</li>
      <li>I bought this with high hopes but was let down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I adore this one!!!! The first shampoo ever I love so much! It moisturizes my hair so nicely! I do love it and recommend to get!! Super great!</li>
    <li> I have used this several times in hope that I would like it better.I hate it .It ties my hair in knots and it very hard to comb threw after shampooing and conditioning.It made my hair feel very coarse dry and very dull.I will go back to what I use to use.I tried this over and over with the same results.And I was soooo looking forward to this new organix line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been alternating, depending on my mood, between Organix Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo and Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Shampoos. Both shampoos have produced excellent results for my hair. Both shampoos smell great, with the fragrances from both shampoos lasting for days. And both shampoos leave my hair shiny, soft, smooth, and straight. The Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo is paraben free and provides natural vitamin E to the hair while protecting the hair from UV damage. The Brazilian Keratin Therapy Shampoo has organic cocoa nut oil, keratin proteins, organic avocado oil, cocoa butter, and is sulfate and sodium free. What I like about the Organix brand is that they don&#x27;t test on animals and that their bottles are eco-friendly. I&#x27;m very pleased with both of these shampoos.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo but it leaves my hair feeling a little greasy. It works great for when I blow dry my hair because it keeps more moisture in my hair but I dont blow dry all the time, maybe 2-3 times a month. I still like this shampoo but not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I love the Organix Moroccan Argan Oil shampoo.  The Shampoo is non-stripping and sulfate free and lathers ok even with my hard water thanks to the Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate which is a great substitute for sulfates and it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair&#x27;s natural oils. \\&quot;Squeaky clean\\&quot; hair isn&#x27;t good.     I love three things about this shampoo and dislike nothing so far.     First thing I love is this shampoo is fresh smelling rather than nutty or sweet.  Several shampoos I have used which have Argan Oil or any other type of nut based oil always smell sweet or nutty and I get tired of smelling that over time. This shampoo smells clean and not too heavy in scent but it leaves a fresh scent behind, something my husband enjoys .... a lot.  :)     The scent reminds me of soap scent , something like Ivory soap but with a slightly sweet undertone.  Nothing over powering IMO but when effort is made to get a whiff of your hair you can smell it.      The second thing I love about this shampoo has Argan Oil in it but doesn&#x27;t have so much in it that I start to feel it build up.  I have used this shampoo for a month now without feeling like I need to switch to another shampoo to strip the extra oil out of it.  There is another brand of shampoo which has Argan oil in it and even though I truly enjoy it, it&#x27;s not a shampoo I feel I can use long term because I start to feel like my hair was becoming oily faster than normal.  The Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo has NOT left me with that feeling yet it it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.          Last but not least is the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free and at a reasonable cost. There are not many shampoos available at your local grocery store which is sulfate free.  The fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free does mean it will not lather up as easily as shampoos with sulfates but please read up on sulfates and what they are. The only purpose they serve it create lather but these very things can also cause dandruff in some people.  My scalp is extremely sensitive to sulfates. For years I had horrible dry and oily dandruff, break outs on my scalp and even bleeding until I found the culprit is the sulfates in our shampoos. Dandruff shampoos were not helping because they all contained sulfates. Once I switched to a sulfate free shampoo the very FIRST shampoo I noticed a huge difference. No dandruff. No tight scalp, no flakes and no overly oily scalp. The only purpose for sulfates in our shampoos is to allow the shampoo to lather, especially for those who have hard water. It&#x27;s debatable whether lathering is actually needed in a cleaner. Some people feel it&#x27;s not and we as consumers only have an association with lather as clean where others say the later helps to move dirt. I&#x27;m with those who feel it&#x27;s not needed but with the Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate in this shampoo I feel I get the best of both worlds.      I wash my hair every other day but shower every day. Anyone who is prone to frizzy hair should be able to relate to this regime or should consider not washing their hair every day as it strips the oil from your hair.    My hair type in case anyone wants to compare is semi coarse , thick, with a natural wave and once prone to frizzing. It&#x27;s black and I&#x27;m a Caucasian mix Asian heritage</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo because I have recently been sick, and my hair has suffered the consequences. After a recent hospital stay my hair has been falling out, dull looking, and not easy to style. I used this shampoo for the first time today and as soon as it began to dry I noticed a difference in my hair. My hair is softer to the touch and has it&#x27;s normal shine again. I did not put any product in it at all and my hair is beautiful. Seems like a miracle shampoo to me! Love. (I have red curly hair that frizzes, I straighten it every day).</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes your hair soft and shiney (which is what I was going for).  BUT I cannot live with the scent.  I read in one review that it smelled like a men&#x27;s locker room but I tried it anyway.  It&#x27;s not so bad during use or right after but as your hair dries and forever after that it smells worse than a men&#x27;s locker room!  I quit using it after three tries.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair that has a tendency to go haywire in the humidity that is Florida summer. I&#x27;ve used several of the Organix lines and inevitably switch around when I get bored with the smell. The Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner just smells so nice, I think I may stick with it for a while. It is reminiscent of baby shampoo and smells very fresh and clean. The Shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much but that is because of the lack of sulfates which is a good thing.  The shampoo and conditioner do not dry my hair out nor leave too much oil so I&#x27;m left with a shiny head of happily balanced hair. However, products that go down the drain are never meant to be the magic bullet for great hair so I do need to use product on top of these to keep my hair from looking like a mad scientist.</li>
    <li> My Dove Advanced Hair Series Oxygen Moisture Shampoo is empty, so I decided to try something new. I seen this&lt;br /&gt;OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco while looking for options on what to try next. I noticed it mostly has positive reviews and thats why I decided to buy it. I see nothing wrong with it so far. It does leave my hair soft and moisturized :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care who you are, or what you say, this shampoo leaves a woman&#x27;s hair smelling like she was born from ANGELS....it&#x27;s AMAZING, I snort her hair like CRACK after she uses this stuff.....crazy crazy crazy good smell.....that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo and lovely scent.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> smells great and my fine hair is fuller</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the shampoo and conditioner. I have us the oil for about 1 year. Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this product before (Organix) and this one is different (OGX). it smells different and doesn&#x27;t do the same for my hair. I guess it&#x27;s ok tho, but just not what I expected. I think maybe it is an imitation brand or something.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair. My hair after shampooing is not tangled or frizzy.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, as I really love all the OGX shampoos, but this shampoo is awful. I have thick, coarse hair that tends to dry out and after trying the OGX Coconut Milk shampoo (which smells great, but tended to dry my hair out a bit), I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. The renewing Argan OIl shampoo lathers great, and seems to rinse out while you&#x27;re in the shower. However, when you go to comb/blowdry/style your hair, it is completely evident that there is  a lot of residue build up with this shampoo, no matter how much you rinse your hair out in the shower. I&#x27;ve only  used it 3 times in the past week and it has made my hair super heavy, greasy, and my scalp super itchy. I would NOT recommend this shampoo whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Smooth hair , and nice smell.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy or left with a not so clean feeling &amp; it has a soft vanilla smell! It shipped in 3 days &amp; was in brand new condition! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great product!  Cleans well and leaves my hair soft and shiny without lots of chemicals.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes but was let down. It left my hair (which is pretty thick and straightish with a wave, and color treated) feeling DRY of all things! I was really surprised. It helps smooth it out but doesn&#x27;t feel silky, nourished or soft as I imagined. The scent is a little iffy also. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product was a little expensive but it smelled good, and I&#x27;ve read about the benefits of argan oil so I bought it. I have thick, course, curly hair and the shampoo and conditioner made my hair dry, and full of static. I really wish I could return it and get my money back so i can buy twice as much Dove shampoo and conditioner which works way better.</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft and maageable. i love this product line I think it is the best, and i am a licensed cosmetoligist</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo out there. It smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and shiny without using conditioner. The no sulfate formula is a nice plus. Would definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> One word describes this argan oil shampoo- incredable!!  The Organix argan oil shampoo comes in a 13 Oz bottle, which should last awhile depending on hair length and frequency of shampooinv.&lt;br /&gt;After just one use my hair was never so soft, shiny, healthy, and easier to manage. I didn&#x27;t expect such quick or amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this shampoo other than the argan oil is you don&#x27; need alot, rinses out.completly with no remain residue.&lt;br /&gt;I did not find this shampoo any more thicker than the average cream shampoo.  Nor did I find it hard to rinse out as other reviews have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I have now changed from Loreal Power Moisture to Organix argan oil shampoo.. This product is a keeper for life.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Organix argan oil shampoo if you&#x27;re looking to improve the health of your hair. Works well on gray hair.</li>
    <li> i bought the trial versions of the shampoo and conditioner to try this product out instead of spending 6.00 for each bottle and end up not liking it . While lathering the shampoo it felt like I was lathering my hair in grease! I kept feeling the need to wash my hair more and more. My hair was very hard to comb through took me like 20 minutes to comb though my long thick wavy hair. Once it dried it made my hair shinier but very oily and frizzy it made my hair so much frizzier than other cheaper shampoos I&#x27;ve used. And it has an Unpleasant manly cologne scent. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy the full bottles would of been a huge waste of money. I&#x27;m going to stick to herbal essence they work soooo much better than any expensive salon brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This was my first try of this shampoo and I will be purchasing again in the future, nice scent, hair feels softer</li>
