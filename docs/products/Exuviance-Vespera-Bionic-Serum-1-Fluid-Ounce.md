      <li>I like that this feels light on my face.</li>
      <li>After only 4 weeks seeing great results.  </li>
      <li>It is so worth it!</li>
      <li>They give out wonderful (large) samples of their other products so you can try before you buy!</li>
      <li>It will sticky at first but dries to a nice soft finish.  </li>
      <li>I originally was sold on this product at Ulta Beauty Supply and the price was about 10% higher there than through Amazon, which I found to be the cheapest anywhere.</li>
      <li>This item is a bit pricey, but so worth it.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, Amazon sellers have the best deal on Exuviance products, but if you get a chance to meet with an Exuviance rep at Ulta or other retail store, definitely make a point to do it!</li>
      <li>, I pat my face a couple of times and the serum sink in right away.  </li>
      <li>I no longer need full coverage foundation and can go to the gym makeup free and be completely confidant.</li>
      <li>Overnight skin becomes soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The one product I consistently use.</li>
      <li>When I tried a sample of this product from a local store it worked much better than what I received in the mail.</li>
      <li>this is my second bottle love it.</li>
      <li>think I really like it!</li>
      <li>serum feels a bit sticky at first</li>
      <li>Though with all &#x27;age fighting&#x27; lines, I feel like I really won&#x27;t know if I made the right choices for another 10 years.  </li>
      <li>Most moisturizers feel too think to me and this feels more thin and clean.</li>
      <li>Getting Exuviance Vespera Bionic at Amazon saves me a great deal and the service is greatI always receive my purchases on time or even earlier than expected.  </li>
      <li>Certainly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Since I started to use this 2 weeks ago, I certainly noticed the difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>This product does feel a bit sticky, as others have noted, but it really does the job and the stickiness goes away after a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
      <li>Just a dab works for the whole face.</li>
      <li>Thanks Thanks</li>
      <li>Occasionally, I forget what a great job it does and try something else only to come back to this.  </li>
      <li>It really lightened the brown age spots on my face.</li>
      <li>Works well, love this, soaks in quickly, not sticky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and most likely will stick with it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes but it just does not absorb into my skin and leaves me feeling greasy all day.  </li>
      <li>Give it a few days to work its magic. .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more hydrated and does not feel nor have the occasional dry feeling any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product completely changed my face and my confidence level.</li>
      <li>and maybe my wrinkles are a little less prominent!</li>
      <li>I am 63 and live in the high altitude and very dry Sierra Nevada Mountains and this product keeps my skin moisturized without being oily or greasy and looking young and vital.</li>
      <li>I was disappointed because this product has very good reviews.</li>
      <li>I notice a huge difference in my skin already after only a few days.  </li>
      <li>In weeks, I see apparent improvement in the texture of my skin and diminished lines.  </li>
      <li>I use this under a regular moisturizer at night, and I wake up with my skin feeling lush and supple, not dry.  </li>
      <li>Just a little is enough to my whole face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product.  It really lightened the brown age spots on my face.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to purchase this product at such a great price point.  It is an excellent product.  But even better, the product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition.  I would go back to this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  In my judgement, this is the best serum on the market--and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> I love the serum but the package was not sealed with cellophane.  I purchased another Exuviance product and it was properly sealed.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum for a friend of mine who lives in Italy and cannot find it easily.  She swears that it is the only serum that makes her skin feel and look younger.  Great experience with vendor:  arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this line of products.  Though with all &#x27;age fighting&#x27; lines, I feel like I really won&#x27;t know if I made the right choices for another 10 years.  :)  But skin feels hydrated and it works well under make-up.  What I really love from Exuviance is their foundation line but I haven&#x27;t bought it on Amazon so wasn&#x27;t prompted to rate it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Occasionally, I forget what a great job it does and try something else only to come back to this.  It evens skin tone and adds glow.</li>
    <li> Love this product this is my second bottle love it.</li>
    <li> When I tried a sample of this product from a local store it worked much better than what I received in the mail. My facial skin felt tight and firm, hence the reason I purchased a bottle. I&#x27;m not certain why there is a difference but I&#x27;m not getting the same results.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. This keeps moisture in my face better than any product I have used. The one product I consistently use.</li>
    <li> Always get this for a great price online. My sister got me hooked on this after it erased 10 years of fine lines and wrinkles from her face. I was amazed, tried it myself and still amazed, been using it for over 6 months and my skin keeps getting better. I do use this nighttime restorative everyday in combination with this product.</li>
    <li> I actually see a difference in the texture in my skin, it does what it says it does.I will keep buying it</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because this product has very good reviews. I wished it worked but my skin didn&#x27;t like it...too sticky even after one hour!</li>
    <li> I have looked forward to using this product because I am seeing the results within a 2 week period. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Just a little is enough to my whole face. I actually see a difference when I use it and when I don&#x27;t. My skin is oily and it&#x27;s a good thing to use in the winter. I don&#x27;t really love creams, so I like that this feels light on my face. Haven&#x27;t tried it on summer yet, but I&#x27;ll definitely buy another one once mine ends.</li>
    <li> what more can I say. Beauty products are hit and miss.  This was a &#x27;miss&#x27; for me. Didn&#x27;t like the sticky-feel of the product either.</li>
    <li> tried this solely based on the reviews. I have tried lots of creams but this one does make my skin feel good. it sinks in right away and a little does in deed go a long way. think I really like it! and maybe my wrinkles are a little less prominent!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum.  It takes very little to cover the face and neck.  It will sticky at first but dries to a nice soft finish.  I use it under my moisturizer.  After only 4 weeks seeing great results.  Strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wish I could bathe in this stuff.  It makes my makeup go on really easily and I use less of it.  It&#x27;s also great to wear it with no makeup on the weekend.</li>
    <li> My skin has changed dramatically after using EVB Serum for just five days.  Very happy with the resuls.  Certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I feel my skin firm, hydrated. Greate product. Recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> This non-oily serum is a delight. Just a dab works for the whole face. Super-rich in emollients, it is ideal for aging skin. This item is a bit pricey, but so worth it. I originally was sold on this product at Ulta Beauty Supply and the price was about 10% higher there than through Amazon, which I found to be the cheapest anywhere. The entire Exuviance line is quite wonderful. I am 63 and live in the high altitude and very dry Sierra Nevada Mountains and this product keeps my skin moisturized without being oily or greasy and looking young and vital.</li>
    <li> This product completely changed my face and my confidence level. I could write a 5 page essay on this product and the reasons why I love it. If you are debating….please BUY THE PRODUCT. It is so worth it! Just from using a tiny, tiny amount at night, my skin is radiant, moisturized, has amazing texture (smooth as butter), and BEST OF ALL free of all my acne scars!!!! I NEVER thought it would possible to say this. I have had terrible skin my whole life, this is a life changer. I no longer need full coverage foundation and can go to the gym makeup free and be completely confidant. I am amazed. This product has so many benefits. It works fast, lasts all day and delivers unbelievable results. THAANK YOU for this product!!! My terrible skin is now beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So worth the money!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great! I&#x27;ve used this item for several years. I like the way it feels. Not sure what it&#x27;s doing.Thanks Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using Exuviance Vespera Bionic for a year now and it is fantastic. Getting Exuviance Vespera Bionic at Amazon saves me a great deal and the service is greatI always receive my purchases on time or even earlier than expected.  All of the Exuviance products are great.</li>
    <li> Great product.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Exuviance day cream with SPF15 during the day, then Exuviance night cream for evening.  My skin is very good and I am in my 40th.  Since I started to use this 2 weeks ago, I certainly noticed the difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s much more hydrated and does not feel nor have the occasional dry feeling any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum feels a bit sticky at first, I pat my face a couple of times and the serum sink in right away.  Then I put Exuviance cream OR Cerave cream on top and my face feel well moisturized through the day.  It&#x27;s working wonderfully and I will certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works well, love this, soaks in quickly, not sticky.</li>
    <li> Need a serum that actually works? This is the one for you! I&#x27;ve been using Exuviance for two years now.. people guess my age 20 years younger than what I actually am.. try it and see what it can do for you...</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a decent price for women in their 40&#x27;s.  Many pricey over the counter products I purchase at department stores do not even contain hyaluronic acids.  I use this under a regular moisturizer at night, and I wake up with my skin feeling lush and supple, not dry.  In weeks, I see apparent improvement in the texture of my skin and diminished lines.  I tried using other serums claiming similar preventive purposes and or results but nothing compares to the comfort and results delivered by Vespera Bionicc serum.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and most likely will stick with it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. :(</li>
    <li> My dry skin soaks this up. Overnight skin becomes soft and smooth. Makeup glides on wonderfully after cleansing in the morning. Give it a few days to work its magic. .</li>
    <li> This product does feel a bit sticky, as others have noted, but it really does the job and the stickiness goes away after a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and I use it for day and nighttime moisturizing. Most moisturizers feel too think to me and this feels more thin and clean.</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed in this product...I had high hopes but it just does not absorb into my skin and leaves me feeling greasy all day.  Makes my face shiny which I do not like at all and have seen no difference in my skin.  It may work for others, just not for me.</li>
    <li> Love this and can&#x27;t be without it.Made such a big difference in my skin-smoother, firmer. To address the \\&quot;stickiness\\&quot; issue that some other reviewers have mentioned, Vespera is a serum. Once it dries, it is not sticky, and I use it with a moisturizer and primer before applying make up. I ran out of Vespera and have to wait to receive my order- I notice a huge difference in my skin already after only a few days.  It is not as clear or supple as it has been and my pores look bigger:(  In my opinion, Amazon sellers have the best deal on Exuviance products, but if you get a chance to meet with an Exuviance rep at Ulta or other retail store, definitely make a point to do it! They give out wonderful (large) samples of their other products so you can try before you buy!</li>
