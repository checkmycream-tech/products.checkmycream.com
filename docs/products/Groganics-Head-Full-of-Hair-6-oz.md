<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I HAVE TRYED sO...... MANY PRODUCTS. But THIS PRODUCT HERE GROGANICS IS GREAT! FANTASTIC! WONDERFUL! BEAUTIFUL! MARBELOUS! I LOVE IT !!!! FOR 15 YEARS OR SO MY HAIR HAS BEEN COMING OUT . I TRYED JUST ABOUT EVERTHING....  IT WAS GETTING SO BAD FOR ME, I WAS JUST GOING TO WEAR A BALL HEADED FADE OR JUST STARTED WEAR WIGS. UNTIL I CAME ACROSS :) HEAD FULL OF HAIR BY GROGANICS THANK YOU FOR HEARING MY CRY. I&#x27;M OVER 50 AND I BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 2 MONTHS AND WEAR IT WAS BALLING I CAN NOW BRAID.  THANK YOU MMWELLS</li>
    <li> A few months ago, my hair was badly damaged by chemicals used for dying my hair in a colour. My hair dropped; leaving spots and thin hair! My hair was short, thin and lifeless! SO, I found a hairdresser that only treats damaged hair. She gave me a six weeks protein steam then recommended GROGANICS  HEAD FULL OF HAIR! At first, I was very curious about the product because most of the women who came to the salon walked with their GROGANICS HEAD FULL OF HAIR to use after steaming! I realized ALL the women that came into the salon had long, healthy, full, beautiful hair! When I asked them about the products they use, they showed me their bottle of  GROGANICS HEAD FULL OF HAIR! So it has been a month using this product and it works!!!!!!! my hair is now full and growing beautifully! EVERY OTHER night, i part my mixed hair (I am portuguese Indian and African mixed) and I apply it to my scalp and massage! I then brush my hair and tie it before I sleep! I realized when using this product, you do not need to use any other hair products such as leave in hair conditioner, grease, hair lotion, hair polish etc. This product is balanced! It gives moisture but it is NOT greasy! it is a perfect combination of herbs that gives your hair a soft texture. I like my hair bouncy, so whenever I go to the hairdresser, I wash, steam and dry using hair rollers (NOT BLOW DRYER AND NO FLAT IRON: THESE THINGS BURST HAIR) then I apply  GROGANICS HEAD FULL OF HAIR and leave my hair out (real bouncy and natural). People must understand that diet compliment the products they use! I also changed my diet! I am eating  foods that stimulate hair growth! Foods such as green leafy vegetables, Vitamin c, cinnamon Tea, foods rich in protein and biotin, stuff like sunflower seeds, strawberries, broccoli, tomatoes and there are others you can research! Since I want my hair to grow, I&#x27;ve stopped having SOY products because these things works AGAINST what you want to achieve. Since my diet change, my body feels great! I have a high metabolism and my hair grows well with GROGANICS HEAD FULL OF HAIR. You cannot expect to see great results if you do not change your lifestyle! A product needs other things to compliment it for rapid results!s great! I have a high metabolism and my hair grows well with GROGANICS HEAD FULL OF HAIR. You cannot expect to see great results if you do not change your lifestyle! A product needs other things to compliment it for rapid results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this but no results!  The product is light and not oily so I was happy about that but I have seen NO results and I only use it on my temples and nape of my neck.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It is helping my hair. Excellent</li>
    <li> Was planning on buying this product, but half the review say, \\&quot;awesome, go for it,\\&quot; and the other half, \\&quot;terrible, made my hair fall out?!?\\&quot; ... So who&#x27;s exaggerating??</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work.. At all... Period</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair DO NOT use this. Save your money.  It is so very greasy and sticky. I have used it once and is now in the bin</li>
    <li> Good product, soothing to scalp,</li>
    <li> I have always had very thick hair. As I progressed through my 30&#x27;s and now am in my early 40&#x27;s my hair has started to thin. I had no idea what was going on until I began researching possible causes. One cause is the drop in estrogen and the increase in testosteone that happens when one is pre-menopuasual. Another cause was hypothyroidism. Lack of vitamins and minerals as well as poor hair care are other factors I am addressing. I no longer chemically relax my hair. I use shea butter, castor oil, olive oil, tea tree and jojoba oil to moisturize and condition. In addition I am shampooing and conditioning with Groganics products. My hair is growing in the crown, temple, and nape of my neck. After three months of consistent use of this product along with other measures I can say that I am happy with where my hair is and look forward to more growth!</li>
    <li> Im a white female..my hair was thinning from taking Plan B pills..Im on my second jar..I apply it at night before bed. I noticed more and more growth..and it doesnt leave a greasy feeling! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, I love the way it makes my scalp feel. I can&#x27;t really tell if this product is the reason my hair has grown so fast because I also use other products that is suppose to benefit hair growth and health. This particular product is just so good for the feeling of my scalp that I&#x27;ll keep using it for that reason. Love it! Sorry for people with bad results, can&#x27;t expect everyone to have the same result because everyone has different genetics. Try biotin too...!</li>
    <li> I have been using the grogranics head full of hair topical treatement for a little over a week and the results are phenomenon. I have noticed fast new growth especially since I had just gotten a relaxer a week before. The jar says \\&quot;you will be amazed at the fast hair growth.\\&quot; I&#x27;m truly amazed because I was having problems with the crown of my hair regrowing. I went to a dermatologist and was prescribed to use clobex, which didn&#x27;t give me fast results like this. My beautician recommended that I try the groganics topical scalp treatment, which I did try and I ordered a jar of it but the head full of hair treatment caught my attention so I ordered that too. I started using the regular groganics topical scalp treatment in the crown area first and I was seeing a little change in the area but I saw rapid change when I started using \\&quot;Head full of Hair.\\&quot; I part my scalp and apply it to the problem area and I have noticed that the area that wouldn&#x27;t grow in years is starting to have hair growth. I recommend that you try this product because I have tried many scalp treatments and this one has worked for me. I think it is a trial and error process with hair treatments so this may not work for everyone but it works for me.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t help my hair at all</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked all that well for me but everyone is different. Full bottle with no results</li>
    <li> Excellent Item, received on a timely basis. I will order more in the future. My hair feels nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This product cut off my hair. Before I had average single natural hair in plaits. I have been using this product and almost finished the jar. First it made my hair very dry and stiff and brittle. I continued using it believing it would work. Well I just didnt finish it as my hair fell out in abundance. I am so upset that I did not review the horrible ingredients that are potentially dangerous to anyone with sensitive scalp and hair. Now I have damaged hair with thinning areas which I did not have before.My self confidence is now low low. Horrible! I now will only EVER use natural hair oils. Beware of this product if you have sensitive hair; check the ingredients.  I am 52.  Miriamjoy</li>
    <li> I ordered the gel or so I thought but ended up with a creme which I do not like at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it has to be the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair. Can&#x27;t keep it in the house. Lol</li>
    <li> My hair has come out as a result of this product (Groganics Heal ful of hair)&lt;br /&gt; I purchased it on August 17, 2013 and today (Aug. 29,2013 ) I had to stop using it becuase my hair has broken off so badly.&lt;br /&gt;Please tell me what I can do to help regrow my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline Carr&lt;br /&gt;Email: blessin125@aol.com</li>
    <li> Great product! Superfast Shipper!!!!</li>
    <li> Still using got it because my husband used it and said it worked for him.  The jury is still out for me.</li>
    <li> Please disregard Amazon&#x27;s description for the ingredients of this item.  After reviewing the ingredients list on Amazon, I decided to purchase Groganics&#x27; Head full of Hair from a local store.  Upon reading the label on the container, I noticed that the ingredients listed was completely different from that of Amazon&#x27;s.  I contacted Groganics Tech USA on Dec. 18, 2007 and they confirmed the following ingredients:    Water, mineral oil, olive oil, petrolatum, vitamin E, propylene glycol, cetereath 20, steric acid, lanolin, DMDM Hydantion, Saw Palmetto, Camomile Extract, Oat Extract, and Fragrance.    If I had known Amazon&#x27;s ingredient description was incorrect, I would never have purchased this item.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I believes it&#x27;s working my bald spots are growing back and plenty of the breaking seems to have stopped, am going to continue using it and write a follow up review, so far I like it</li>
    <li> I loved this product it does not work swiftly, but nevertheless hair growth is produced at a very slow, steady rate.</li>
    <li> I just found out about this product, so day is my first time using it.  I lost my hair during cancer treatment.  However, even though some of my hair has grown back slowly, I have areas where it has grown little to none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair so that this will be the only product on it, so that I can see the results.  I can actually feel it penetrating through my scalp as if it is massaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will come back each week to give an update, providing that I can provide more than one review.</li>
    <li> this product is very nice. I like the smell of it. I will continue to buy this product. You will love it</li>
    <li> I like that it darkens my hair and makes hair shine but is a bit oily . I will continue to use and re-evaluate</li>
    <li> UGH! I was born with thick hair, but I got sick last year and my hair started to thin. I tried this because of the good reviews. I was so disappointed. I&#x27;m used to daily cream based lotion, but I didn&#x27;t like this consistency at all. It was very thick and wet. This product change the texture of my hair!! Made it very coarse.  I believe you are better off using growth oils that just have essentials oils with keratin and biotin. I tried one at random and I really like it..my hair is slowly but surely getting back to it&#x27;s original state. At least with those oils you won&#x27;t have to worry about chemical usage.</li>
    <li> I have been using now for almost 8 months. wish I found this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It help my scalp feel strong and my hair is staying in place even after I shower and use a towel to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the shampoo and root lifter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend. Need to buy more now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see where it works.</li>
    <li> What is this stuff??? It&#x27;s gross on the hair and does not come out with washing the hair! How is this supposed to make your hair grow?</li>
    <li> It made my hair come out! I have extra bald spot in my head. I am very sad, I should have followed my mind and never order this item.</li>
    <li> Yes I should have sued them but I waited to long hoping my hair would grow back, this is crap it changed the texture of my hair when it finally did grow back to fine and brittle plus my hair never fully grew back. Save yourself the heart ache and pain. I am still trying to fix this 4 years later.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Quick shipping</li>
    <li> love it it does work for me I notice after a month of using this product my hair has been growing</li>
    <li> I came across the Groganics Products on Ebay but I usually look up reviews on Amazon.com so I did and I saw a lot of positive reviews which caused me to purchase the products and I have since received them and I started using them immediately because my hair has been damaged and broken off for some time Its only been 3 days and I can say that I can tell a difference in the texture of my hair as well the thickness in this short period of time as well a small spot that was thin is now filling in with new hair. I ordered the Head full of Hair, the Hair Gro-n-Wild, Growth Moisturizing Lotion and I use them all in my hair as well I&#x27;m waiting on the Root Lifter to be delivered I am pleased with what I see and the difference that I feel in my hair from using the Groganics Products and I hope that this review will be a help to someone . As previously stated in some reviews that everything doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for everybody and that&#x27;s true but I can say it is a blessing to me and I&#x27;m glad I found them.</li>
    <li> I like this product it does what it said I love the smell of it I enjoy using it good product</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, for two days so far and although it is suppose to be a cream, it is a greasy cream.  It leaves my hair greasy and stiff.  I was told by the company that this is the \\&quot;non-greasy product.\\&quot;  I am going to give it time to work, however the greasy aspect of it makes my hair look thinner after I apply it to my scalp.  I am going to try it as an overnight, and wash it out in the morning.</li>
    <li> It really works, love it</li>
    <li> Love the way it pentrates my hair</li>
    <li> I love this product it really works my hair got longer and Fuller. I&#x27;ve tried so many expensive hair products and by far this is the only thing that works, plus I&#x27;m Jamaican LOL so I&#x27;m sticking to this</li>
    <li> I have used this product for awhile now and I can&#x27;t say that is will grow your hair but it slows the lost of it down.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time now... I can honestly say that it worked for me. Me edges were badley damaged from tight braids and chemicals etc... As soon as I started using \\&quot;Head Full Of Hair\\&quot; my hair started growing right away. I haven&#x27;t seen this much growth in years. I love this product and recommend it to all...</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Works as stated. After one week of use, the length of my hair double!  I used it along with the Groganics  Deep Freeze Follicle Cleanser Shampoo  and Scalp Abosorbent Shampoo and Scalp Stimulant Conditioner.</li>
    <li> it help my hair look full I love it so keep up the good work</li>
    <li> I just brought this about a week ago and started to apply it to my scalp daily. I have braids in my hair right now and won&#x27;t be taking them out until January, anyways I can not really tell right now whether it will work or not for me. The only thing that I can say, is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy and it does have cooling feeling to it. I will probably do a product update after I take these braids out in 3 months</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I am Italian and have thick hair and this makes it more manageable.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and plan to buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m what you would call &amp;#34;tender head&amp;#34; so I comb my hair gently and after applying to scalp my hair is easier to comb.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks. I used it a few times the first week and saw no results. However, last week I started seeing new growth in areas that were bald and my edges started getting longer. One surprising and very welcome benefit is that it has turned most of my grey hairs black. I like this more than even the new growth and thickness. My hair started going grey and 25 and at 40, almost all my new edge hairs grow in grey. I have tried many dyes which have caused a lot of damage. If groganics continues keeping the grey hair black, I will continue using it. I&#x27;m so very excited that I may no longer have to use smelly dye on my hair anymore. Thanks very much for this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a month, I seam to be loosing less hairs in the shower. Also a tiny bit of peach fuzz seamed to have grown on my temples. This is  by no means a cure for male pattern baldness, does seam to help a little bit though...</li>
    <li> This is a nice cream product that is not greasy and makes your head feel good, and gives the hair a great shine</li>
    <li> great product....I love the feeling ....when I put it  in my hair.. I believe  it will work....only tried in  a few days...great so far.. did not regret buying it .</li>
    <li> I how been using this product for 8 month it  grow  your hair but dry it than it break off now you can&#x27;t call cause the phone off</li>
    <li> Super Fast Shipping. Been Using It a Week &amp; See Results. Love How It Tingles When You Apply It. Will Update In a Week.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing the Groganics product; plus 2 friends have been using this products for 6 months and the results are as promised. Understanding that results can vary from person to person, I see a difference. I normally wear braids and twice a year I wear my hair out. In September I noticed my hair began to fall out - I blame it on stress &amp; hormones etc. My hair length was at the tip of my shoulders-now its at the nape of my neck, I would comb/brush my hair  &amp; it would come out and if I ran my hands through my hair I would get the same result. I&#x27;ve been using the Groganics products for less than a month now and I don&#x27;t see as much shedding and it appears to be slightly thicker and that could be because I have no chemicals (perms/relaxer) in my hair. I&#x27;ve gotten it cut evenly all over, I&#x27;ve taken before pictures and I don&#x27;t expect to see any real results for at least 6 months but as for now I am glad its not shedding the way that it was previously. I will continue to use the Pills, Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Grease as instructed. As far as the smell of the hair grease its not as bad as others have described and the tingling sensation you get after using the conditioner, is quite mild and doesn&#x27;t last long. I am definitely a satisfied customer and I would recommend this product to others. *RESULTS VARY FOR EACH PERSON, THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN IN TO CONSIDERATION*</li>
    <li> this product  is  very good also,  i just ran  out of it.</li>
    <li> Yes,this is really good mask.It works slow but it really works!We aren&#x27;t waiting for a miracles but the good result and it is.And the nice point of this item is not making the hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I really really love it. I&#x27;m starting to see results and I&#x27;ve only been using the product for 2 weeks. I apply it on my problem areas twice a day and massage and brush the area to stimulate growth.</li>
    <li> The hair gro-n-wild is a better product  At the time of order I believed I was purchasing the gro-n.wild . With the no return policy I will have to be satisfied with Head full of Hair. They both work on stopping my hair loss.</li>
    <li> Recieved it today, it didn&#x27;t take long at all ! Used it just now and it smells great and the feeling is tingling. I know it&#x27;s working. I will re-rate in a week !</li>
    <li> I love groganics head full of hair! My ends are no longer dry and the texture of my hair is just really soft</li>
    <li> This has nonorganic chemicals. Very misleading and unlike many of their organic products.</li>
    <li> Review submitted in Feb. 2013.  My wife and granddaughters liked this product and were very pleased that this product was purchased for them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and some of the other groganics items and have seen phenomonal results! Literally overnight I noticed a difference in my hair line that had been damaged from pulling my hair back. I have told many friends about this item and they have all seen the same results. It is a must for your hair care!</li>
    <li> good product, just a bit harsh on hair ends</li>
    <li> The product is great.  I was thinning  it has made my hair fuller and healthier. I will continue to use it.  It gave me the result I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple months ago and it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.  Seeing the positive reviews makes me upset because I feel like their unbelievable but tht goes to show is could work and it may not. But for me it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works really well. My bald spots are gone and the hair in the front are growing really well &amp; I Love That Tingle!</li>
