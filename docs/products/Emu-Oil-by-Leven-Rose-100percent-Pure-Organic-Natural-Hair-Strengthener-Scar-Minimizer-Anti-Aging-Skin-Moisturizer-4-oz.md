<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil really do work on hair, skin and pain</li>
    <li> This is an amazing, beautiful, clean emu oil. My skin has poor elasticity (prone to cracking and stretch marks) and I have only been using for a few days but already my skin feels softer, smoother, more flexible. Too soon for visible results but I am definitely enjoying this on my face and body.</li>
    <li> I bought the glass 1 oz bottle of the Beard Oil along with 2 of the 1 oz glass bottles of emu oil and a 4 oz glass bottle of Jojoba Oil from Leven Rose on Amazon for christmas...for myself.  I received all of them in a very timely manner and they were very well packaged.  I have had them since Christmas and I am very pleased with ALL 3 products.  Leven Rose is the real deal.  Now, on to about the emu oil: I have had these products for a few weeks now and believe that I am able to properly review their products after using them regularly for some time now.  Leven Rose was having an insane sale on all their products, so I bought. The emu oil is very soft and absorbs quickly.  I have been using it in my hair oil mixture mostly, though also on my skin. It does not leave a residue or oily film.  I use it on my lips as well and it leaves them soft and almost silky like.  Great quality stuff here.  I also use it around my eyes and anywhere else I see fit as I do all other pure oils such as the emu oil.  If you are looking for high quality product Leven Rose has it. I normally do not do online reviews, I am more of the word of mouth kind of broad, but this company deserves the time and effort.  Thank you Leven Rose, for the quality product for decent price and great sale price and for your outstanding customer service.  You will see my business again.</li>
    <li> Great emu oil feels good on my skin and hair leaves it with great shine. Recommend this 100%  Recieved this item free in Exchange for my Honest review.</li>
    <li> Great customer service! I love this product!  Perfect presentation ! This oil is great for your hair and skin. It also keeps your heels sandal-ready for the Summer.</li>
    <li> I had great hope for this oil and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I was looking for something for stretchmarks and decided to use on the darkened skin on my chest instead. My skin is lightening nicely on my chest and is super soft. I think if I used twice daily instead of once my results would have been apparent faster.</li>
    <li> Leven rose took away most of dark marks made from bra straps, also any where there&#x27;s uneven skin tones, as well as hair growth stimulating. I will always keep some around....</li>
    <li> Amazing oil!! This emu oil is so much better than other emu oils that I have tried. I now have my husband using it on his hair, my mom &amp; father using it for many of the pain benefits, and I love it for how it makes my skin so beautiful 👍 I&#x27;ll be placing my 3rd order after I write this. Great stuff - lives up to it&#x27;s claims!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say it has good absorption. I use it on my face as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a car accident and - I kid you not - actually walking into an outside corner wall, my forehead has a few, um, &amp;#34;character marks.&amp;#34; :)  I really think I am seeing some fading and smoothing of the scars thanks to this amazing oil, and I can&#x27;t begin to explain how it goes on rich oil yet is absorbed so quickly and evenly my pillowcase is safe.  Just putting it on feels like a micro-trip to the spa.</li>
    <li> When I am not in my office my hobby is woodworking. I like to maintain my hands in proper loving order for my beautiful wife. This oil not only works fabulous on my hair and goatee, it&#x27;s does wonders for my hands and skin. I have tried many creams and oils in the past specially for my hands but this one is truly in a league of its own.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to thank you so much for your emu oil.  This oil is really helping my friend who had a finger nail that was split and DESTROYED with fungus and grew thick and dead over the years after a bad accident. The doctors said there was nothing they could do and they even surgically removed the nail and it grew back the same way. It looked like tree bark at the end of his finger until your emu oil!! In just 1 week he is already seeing dramatic results!! The nail is forming into one piece and not shards of thick bark like substance. It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have arthritis in my left thumb so bad that it&#x27;s painful for me to open jars sometimes, but I found that gently massaging Emu Oil around the joint eases the pain and inflammation and keeps me functional without having to take Calebrex.  This Emu Oil is an odorless slightly milky oil that absorbs into the skin faster and more completely than other oils and creams, so it goes to work quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily!  I sometimes add a drop of Rosemary oil since the EMU Oil helps transport the Rosemary down into my muscle and joint along with it as it absorbs. Besides relieving inflammation and joint pain though, Emu Oil is a fabulous moisturizer that does wonders for skin and hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massaging Emu Oil into the scalp reportedly prevents hair loss. I&#x27;m not sure about that one way or another, but my daughter likes to run it through her hair to keep it nourished and prevent split ends and it works very well for that because since using this oil regularly her hair is softer, shinier, and looks healthier than it did before.  Emu Oil contains plenty of antioxidants that help protect the skin from the damage done by free radicals, the sun, and environmental pollutants, and it&#x27;s well known as an effective skin cell regenerator and anti-wrinkle agent too. It helps counter wrinkles and dry, scaly, thinning skin that commonly occur with aging, and I need all the help I can get in that department, so I&#x27;m using it directly on my arms, hands, and face. I use just a little bit, about a pea size on my face each night, and it soaks in within seconds, and I can both see and feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to be growing old or have arthritis to benefit from Emu Oil either. Emu Oil has been found to be very effective on burns of all types including sunburn, at reducing the itching, redness, cracking, peeling and scaling associated with Psoriasis &amp; Eczema, and is a marvelous natural treatment for stretch marks and scars.  Leven Rose&#x27;s Emu Oil comes in a dark amber glass bottle with a medicine dropper.  I like that because it bugs the heck out of me when a company sends out of a bottle of expensive oil but it doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper cap or a dropper, so you wind up wasting a lot by pouring it out, you know? This Emu Oil is 100% natural, super filtered, pure unadulterated Emu Oil. It comes from rendered Emu fat, so it&#x27;s not vegan, but it&#x27;s totally natural, safe for all skin types, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and won&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional discount received for evaluation and review purposes.omes in a dark amber glass bottle with a medicine dropper.

    <li> So far, emu oil seems to penetrate my scalp better than most oils I&#x27;ve used. You can feel it working as you massage your scalp...very soothing!</li>
    <li> Although this was on sale when I purchased it that still was expensive for such a small size 😣 The seller&#x27;s including a coupon on their products did help somewhat 😉</li>
    <li> Loving this emu oil. It really softens the lines on my face and makes it look soft and supple. I don&amp;#34;t  detect any odor and a couple of drops go a long way. I am going to order some for my daughter who is prone to breakouts. hope that it works as well for her.</li>
    <li> Looooove it!! And the shipper&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> I used this product for my scalp psoriasis. The oil helped reduce the itching and scales. I recommend everyday use.</li>
    <li> I have used three different oils from level rose and this one is by far the front runner! I bought this oil specifically because my husband and my little boy suffer from eczema. I don&#x27;t love putting products on the skin that is on a steroid level if it can be avoided especially with infants so we tried this. I would try it after a warm bath. I apply it behind the knees and in the creases of his arms where the eczema was the worst and then along to his neck as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d zip up his suit and come morning his eczema would be 75% better! My husband also loves it for the little patches of eczema that flare up on his face randomly. Overall this is a great product. It&#x27;s a smaller bottle, it&#x27;s milky in appearance and sick in texture and I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a daily facial moisturizer because of the shine. but for specific and intense moisturization this is THE BEST!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Seriously knocks joint pain down to almost negligible after rubbing this oil in. It also helped clear up my exzema on my left hand and I rub any excess on my face and in my hair. Makes my skin soft and my hair glisten! I received this product for a reduced price in return for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, pure oil. I bought some from a beauty store for my hair and it had lots of other ingredients in it. No good. This is the pure oil and it&#x27;s worth it. Stick to the pure stuff.</li>
    <li> It is good, it is easily absorbed by the skin... the bottle is so small for its price. I bought other brand a bigger bottle with the same price and just worked the same.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Took care of a terrible sunburn on my nose and healed it fast!  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The Emu Oil is fabulous.  I use it full strength on my crows feet and smile lines, and it seems to be working!  I also use it on my hands at night because living in MN, the weather can be so cruel.  I also have arthritis in my fingers, so putting it on my hands not only softens, but help diminish the pain.  Being 60 plus, my body isn&#x27;t as supple as it once was, but adding this to my daily routine is really starting to help my skin feel so much younger.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this product... Thanks Leven Rose!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to see if it would sooth my rosacea and it certainly did.  I have used so many different creams--from inexpensive to very expensive ones and this emu oil has greatly helped those sore red areas.  No burning my skin, so I&#x27;m well pleased.  Seller is very nice too!</li>
    <li> It arrived quick and it&#x27;s a good product. It is oily though. I use it for a scalp irritation so you have to do a few hours before washing your hair. If you put on after, your hair will be oily. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in just a few applications.</li>
    <li> It works as good as can be for only using for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Leven Rose Pure Organic products! I was kind of skeptical of trying Emu Oil. However, I truly trust Leven Rose products and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the fact that it is 100% Pure with only one ingredient only. I like that there aren&#x27;t any addictives, it&#x27;s Non-GMO, does not carry any parabens, fillers, or any strong fragrances as my skin is very sensitive to those types of things. When trying this Emu oil, I did tons of research before. Like I said, I wondered what emu oil was.The emu is a flightless bird that resembles a small ostrich. Emu oil is taken from the fat of this bird during processing THIS IS NOT A VEGAN PRODUCT. It is used to make medicine as it helps in relieving aches and pains such as muscle cramps and arthiritus, soreness, redness (good for face blotches and broken veins), stretch marks and scars as a natural skin care solution. Eases joint pain, itching (bug bites, sunburns), speeds up wound healing (good for after surgeries), and TONS more. i LOVED that this emu oil by Leven Rose absorbs very quickly into my skin and has a long lasting anti-inflammatory effect (treated my acne and good for acne prone skin like mine). I personally tried this product on my belly as I am a Mother and have stretch marks. Yes, I earned my stripes, however I do wish to minimize my stretch marks and scars. It works! I already see a difference in my skin and noticed that my stretch marks have extremly lightened up.&lt;br /&gt;Another way I tried this particular emu oil was by massaging it onto my scalp. I am trying to grow my hair out and tried the inversion method (rubbed emu oil on my scalp and massaged while bent forward upside down...yes, sounds crazy, but my hair is GROWING healthily). I must say I was very skeptical of trying emu oil but am so thankful I gave it a shot. I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product at a discounted price and or free in exchanged for my honest and unbiased review of the product. I am very greatfulof this opportunity. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and customer service.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered the jojoba oil for me as well as the Emu Oil. I am head over heels in love with the Emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have severe KP (Keratosis pilaris) on my arms and legs, but its much worse on my arms. I started rubbing the Emu Oil all over my arms after my showers and for the first time in years my arms are clearing up, I almost want to cry tears of joy! I can now wear t-shirts and short sleeves without the feeling of embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, like another user stated I love rubbing a little emu oil on my face after chemical peels, helps lock in moisture and keeps my skin looking healthy. Or sometimes when I&#x27;m red and blotchy I put a dab on and viola my face looks amazing. I&#x27;m whole heartedly a big fan of Emu Oil and will continue to use this product from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on top of experiencing an amazing product, I have to say the customer service is fabulous. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I love the Leven Rose line of products.  I just received the Emu oil and am thrilled.  I use this mainly for pain creams since it helps elevate pain.  I also use it as a carrier oil for essential oil  applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great moisturizer too.  The skin feels so soft and smooth after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leven Rose produces a great product but more importantly to me is the fabulous customer service.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:b81bb048655454b31a014474eee2cda7]] I only recently learned about emu oil. I did a bit of research and learned that it has fatty acids that help with inflammation (works with acute rather than chronic inflammation). Emu oil is taken from the fat of this bird during processing. It has been used to make various skin medicine. It is applied to the skin to reduce pain and irritation from shingles, bedsores, insect bites, and variety of other skin issues. Emu oil is also used topically for athlete&#x27;s foot. With so many claims I was both curious and slightly sceptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emu oil is quite thick and somewhat milky in appearance. It is surprisingly not greasy. After applying it with my figures I did not feel like I needed to wash my hands. The oil is totally unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using emu oil for a couple weeks now to treat a scar on my shin. Both of us have been applying the oil once a day for 2 weeks. The skin around my shin scar not only looks bad it is also more sensitive than other areas. Using emu oil made the skin less sensitive and made it look slightly better, although after 2 weeks of use I cannot say it has diminished the scar. So far both of my results are encouraging and we continuing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil comes in a 1 oz bottle with a droplet applicator. I prefer droplet applicators to spray as it lets me control where the oil lands better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This emu oil provided by Levin Rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 2014 update:  I have applying this oil for 6 months now after each shower.  What used to be a red ugly scar is almost normal skin now.  It maybe a coincidence that after several years it got better on its own, but I don&#x27;t think so because it has not improved much over the prior 6 years.</li>
    <li> I feel that I am helping my skin get in a better condition</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t had as much opportunity to use the Emu Oil as we expected but it seems to be high quality and our experience with Leven Rose has always been phenomenal. My wife is put off by the fact that the oil is far from vegetarian but I will update once we have found more use for it and can say how well it worked for us!</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for two days, but I have already seen improvements and I love that it has a dropper lid so that I can easily add it to my lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added it to my body lotion and face lotion, rubbed it directly onto stretch marks and my face.&lt;br /&gt;On my face, I put it around my eyes and on my forehead where there are hints of wrinkles starting.&lt;br /&gt;My skin (everywhere it was applied) is softer and my face is noticeably smoother after only 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using this daily on my skin and Leven&#x27;s Jojoba Oil on my hair since I have had &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; results :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a tip: I add Jojoba, Emu and Organic Lavender Oils to my lotion and my skin is much softer than without the oils.&lt;br /&gt;(I only use Leven Roses&#x27; Jojoba and Emu Oils so I cannot speak to other brands)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love LEVEN ROSE products -- they are of the highest quality, and the products really deliver. I have never used Emu oil before, but so far it has been a great product. At first I was alarmed by the consistency of it (it is very thick) but it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily. My mother used some for her dry hands and cuticles, and she was amazed at how soft the oil made her hands, even after a few days. Normally she would constantly reapply lotions or oils, but with the Emu, her hands and cuticles remained soft and not cracked! Highly recommend this and all of LEVEN ROSE products.</li>
    <li> Hooray! I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to find that Leven Rose now carries emu oil! It&#x27;s a miracle oil for my family. I just recieved my order and used it on our granddaughters bee stings. She quit screaming as soon as I applied it to her armpit. The swelling went down 90% right off the bat. Then it took care of her sunburn just as dramatically. Today it&#x27;s made my arthritis a minor annoyance instead of debilitating. My husband uses it for excema on his knees and elbows. We put it on in the folds of our boxers face when it gets crusty. Don&#x27;t mean to gross you out, but  you&#x27;ve got to try this stuff. Hard to beat as a general cure all.</li>
    <li> Emu oil has natural properties to reduce inflammation and reduce pain. I like to rub it on on joints and recently on my knuckles that got accidentally hit the corner of my car door. It is white creamy when it is cold and clear when it is warm. It works great on skin because it doesn&#x27;t dries up too quickly. You can keep on massaging on the same spot without applying for the second time. It does alleviates and soothes the affected area. Another thing I like is that it is also almost completely odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is bottled in a UV protected vial with a dropper dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for 2 weeks.  It&#x27;s perfect for anyone with dry skin.  A little goes a LOOONNNGGG way!  I use it under my eyes instead of Leven Rose jojoba oil.  It has improved the look of my under eye skin.  I did use this one night on some wrinkles on my forehead.  The next morning my hair had obviously touched it because it was rather greasy.  It&#x27;s too much for my whole face, but perfect for spots.  The quality of this is top of the line.  It&#x27;s white and has no smell at all.  This small bottle will last forever.  I&#x27;d be surprised, with the way that I use it, that it doesn&#x27;t last a year.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I recently had a total knee replacement that left a long ugly scar on the front of my knee and down my leg. After 3 weeks of using this oil twice a day the scar on the lower part of my knee &amp; leg has dramatically lightened and in some areas you can&#x27;t even tell there had been an incision.  I also had a scar from a 2nd degree burn on my thigh and the dark edges are fading as well as the deeper burned areas. It may take 3 or 4 months to maximize the benefits, but hey, it&#x27;s better than spending the time doing nothing.</li>
    <li> This Emu oil is an opaque- white with a smooth, velvety consistency. It feels wonderful on my skin, very moisturizing, not greasy at all. I used it for a few days on my face and my husband commented on how healthy my skin looked. I have always struggled with acne and it began to clear it up in just a few days. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I use this in my cocoa butter whipped lotion, amazing for ur skin :) its white and thick but its ok because it is amazing :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product. I use it for my face, hair and nails. I had a thinning hair line and had checked to see what products I could use that is all natural that would regrow my hair. Everything I found was had ingredients that I wan&#x27;t willing to put on my head, so when I checked the emu oil, I got really excited, because of all the things this oil is good for. I am working on my second bottle, and I must say my hair line is beginning to thicken up. When you use it you must be patient, it will work if you give it time.</li>
    <li> This product is magic.  I have a condition which has left scars all over my arms.  I apply the emu oil once a day.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and it absorbs completely.  After several days of using this emu oil, the redness of my scars has faded significantly.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve used which works, and I&#x27;ve used a bunch.  It even works better than the scar creams sold for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I&#x27;ve had a little sore on the corner of my mouth on and off for years that just keeps coming back.  Emu oil made it go away after two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This oil is very good, but my skin is very sensitive and I broke out.</li>
    <li> Shipping was amazingly fast! Very comparable in price to other brands. Product is the perfect consistency (in comparison to what I have seen from other companies). I&#x27;m currently using it in conjunction with essential oils (as a carrier oil) for my Keratosis Pilaris but I will be using it in other homemade goodies as well. I will update the review when I have more info about how well it works!</li>
    <li> Wished i would of sent back</li>
    <li> I used two bottles of emu oil on my stretch marks that I got from 2 pregnancy and now they are fading away.  They are much much less obvious than before.  I would like the emu oil to be packaged in a bigger bottle since I used it up so fast.  But it worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price!</li>
    <li> I am an avid oil user and am always looking to take my hair and skincare to the net level, including homemade products. I love to research on what is quality to use, the properties it provides and the essential benefits it can provide for me, before it goes on my body.  I have been interested and doing my homework on emu oil for a few years on and off, but was looking for the right kind for me, that also was pure and high quality. One of the things many need to realize it not all products out there are pure and are of great quality, do your research! I received this quite quickly and began my various trials with it. I have used this a natural skin moisturizer after a shower, along with coconut oil as a pre poo.  I have also utilized this mixed with other oils for a leave in conditioner used daily. I also love it for keeping my stomach and surrounding skin soft during my pregnancy as well.  This product also has some other positive features in addition to being 100% pure as well such as being Non-GMO, no parabens, and no fragrances. You get just a pure product for use which is good, and a great base to start with.  I don’t have any now/or yet, but I am also using it daily to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy as well.  Another feature about this is the fast absorbing rate it goes into your skin, keeping it fresh, radiant and supple looking throughout the day.  It is also known  to help with promoting hair growth and health to rejuvenate and moisturize hair as well as replenish tired hair follicles. Leven Rose Emu Oil is a powerful natural hair treatment with highly essential fatty acids containing Omega 3, 6, and 9 as well as linolenic acid and oleic acid for healing. With the backing of the 100% momey back guarantee, you can feel confident and secure that you will be happy with the benefits this product can provide, if not, they will refund you.  You have nothing to lose besides try. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiasedreview.  My reviews and opinions are 100% my own, and are in no way sponsored or compensated for.</li>
    <li> Ladies use this on you crows feet</li>
    <li> I like it but it does not seem to relieve any pain.</li>
    <li> Just received my emu oil a couple days ago and I absolutely love it!!! I have used emu oil before but this one is my new favorite. Great quality oil, it soaks into your skin quickly leaving your skin silky and soft. Perfect to use on your face as a moisturizer. Customer service was exceptional!!! and this is another reason I will buy from Leven Rose in the near future.</li>
    <li> First time using Emu oil, and it&#x27;s nice for moisturizing and massage. Will likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Really good oil, feels like a serum instead of oil.  Skin and hair absolve fast so you will not feel the sticky sensation that others oils leave.  I recommend this product.  :)</li>
    <li> This is the beat emu oil I have purchased I really wish it came in a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> I had a bike accident few weeks ago and had bad bruises and my skin pealed of of my elbow and knee. I just applied this oil on the injuries. It worked like magic !!!</li>
    <li> This oil is beautiful.  I purchased it to use as a carrier oil for other essential oils when treating any sorts of sore muscles, cuts, bruises, etc. because Emu Oil has great anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving qualities.  However, I&#x27;ve found myself using it on my elbows and little random dry spots on my skin and it seriously took care of them within 24 hours.  Just a few drops.  I don&#x27;t care about stretch marks or wrinkles or that sort of thing (although it may work for that), but I do care about having soft smooth skin and this definitely does the trick!  It is non-irritating and doesn&#x27;t sting or anything when used on cuts or abrasions.  It&#x27;s helped my bruises, also.  I will definitely purchase again, but do wish the price was a tad lower.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
    <li> I would give 6 stars if I could! I am absolutely floored at how fast this stuff works. I read another review that it helps Keratosis pilaris, so I was very excited to try it. But I never expected to see results like this. within 20 seconds of rubbing the Emu oil on my arms, the redness is completely gone! I took a picture after I had rubbed it on one arm, but not the other. In the picture the top arm is treated. It is also fades scars and stretch marks. I am starting see improvement in my stretch marks and it&#x27;s only been a few days. But how quickly it removed the redness of the scarring is nothing short of incredible. I won&#x27;t be without this again!  It comes in an amber colored glass bottle that preserves the oil and its effectiveness. It is 100% emu oil with no additives. Rubs on easily and smoothly with no oily residue.  I received a discount coupon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this one!! I would recommend all my friends this great product!!! Makes my skin so smooth and it is visible my skin has less wrinkles!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2-3 weeks now and have noticed a definite difference under my eyes.  The skin seem firmer and lighter, reducing the appearance of fine lines and dark shadowing.  I do have some sun spots near my upper lip and I think those are lightening but it hasn&#x27;t eliminated the discoloration - yet.  (Perhaps with more time).  I notice no smell and the quality is very good.  Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Emu oil has so many uses its amazing. I first bought emu months ago to test out and I was totally surprised at how well emu works. I first used it on dark spots and acne. It works believe it or not. I now even use it on my hair. It helps grow hair back using on hair edges will definitely help growth again. It&#x27;s very light weight and doesn&#x27;t have a smell that&#x27;s overpowering. Very light. It does absorb fast into skin. I&#x27;m in love with emu and I&#x27;m so happy I got the chance to review this at a promo price for my unbiased opinion. Leven rose organic is wonderful. And thank you.</li>
    <li> My doctor loves this oil as it&#x27;s used by her masseuse.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for my Mom and myself to reduce wrinkel and fine lines. After 1 week use, I see a big difference on my Mom&#x27;s skin. She looks yourger with brighter and tighter skin. She loves it and does not want to use anything else except for the oil.&lt;br /&gt;About myself, after getting Frances&#x27; recommendation, I use the jojoba oil in the morning and this oil at night for the best result. I have just appied the emu oil one time last night so I hope that I will receive the same result as my Mom does.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Leven Rose and Frances.</li>
    <li> really nice offering from Leven Rose. Has been great on my skin!</li>
    <li> I decided to go ahead and purchase this after receiving a special promotional offer from the company. I am usually not super optimistic about certain products because many advertise a great deal but fail to live up to my expectations. Leven Rose however, has not failed me yet (I&#x27;ve purchased their Argan and Jojoba oil and loved them both). So, let me give you a brief background about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was in my preteens I&#x27;ve suffered from cystic acne. Due to genetics, I also have naturally oily skin which is sensitive to the products I use. After learning more about natural products, I started using oils to help with the problem (tea tree oil, lavender oil, peppermint....) It wasn&#x27;t until a few months back that I learned about the benefits of jojoba oil (which is similar to the sebum produced from our oil glands) and argan oil (which comes from Morroco and is multi-beneficial). I&#x27;ve been able to use both of them particularly at night after washing my face with no breakouts because of them. But since this review is not about those products, I&#x27;ll get back to the emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully, it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I discovered what emu oil is good for. I assumed that it would just be good for my skin and hair. Fortunately, I was a ignorant to the other benefits. After some research, I discovered emu oil actually comes from a bird (big surprise for me there), and the emu is derived from the adipose tissue (fat) from the bird. I found that research has uncovered a range of purposes for the emu oil, which include the alleviation of pain. So now, let me get back to my concise bio. In high school, I ran cross country for a period, and ended up getting a stress fracture in my right leg. Although it healed, my right knee began to pain me on and off ever since. Correlation is not causation, but the pain was still a nuisance regardless of the cause. I had started wearing Mueller&#x27;s jump knee brace but the relief was mild. Long story short, after I got this approximately 2 weeks ago I proceeded to rub a couple of drops onto my knee right before bed. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting great results but I&#x27;ve been really blessed. As of now, I hardly feel pain in my knee and I continue to use it. I love this miracle oil.</li>
    <li> I love this Emu Oil.  I use it as a moisturizer on my face and it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> Even though I bought this item for a coworker, she states apart from the costing being great the item benefits are excellent.</li>
    <li> Love emu oil. Great for skin inflammations. Some relief for aches and pains.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous product, as described, excellent quality, quick shipping~</li>
    <li> Smells like Java/Coffee Beans. Not bad though. Highly moisturizes my dry hair. I use some before i shampoo/condition &amp; my hair feels so soft and less frizzy!! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on dry skin and scalp. I got it for my boyfriend and I and in one week I have noticed a significant difference in the glow and moisture levels of our skin. I recommend applying the product right after you get out of the shower and really rubbing it in. Thank you for making such great product. I will be sure to buy more!</li>
    <li> The product was great in my homemade soaps! The service was extremely personal and the shipping was on time. Will definitely be ordering from Leven Rose again!</li>
    <li> horrible smell and did nothing for me</li>
    <li> I put these on my stretched ears and then put my silicone tunnels in. Works great :) nice and moisturised.</li>
