<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They work well. No problems so far.</li>
    <li> Big noise. Easy to hurt the hair</li>
    <li> I bought one at a local walmart and I do not recommend this. It&#x27;s very light and has low power. It brakes and splits your hair.The secret of a good clipper is its weight. That is why all the pro ones are very heavy. It cuts better, faster and doesn&#x27;t split/brake the hair.</li>
    <li> buena la maquina, y es recargable, probandola...</li>
    <li> It is OK with that price.</li>
    <li> If you can lure ONE member of your family into cutting your hair with this thing, it&#x27;s one of the best dollar-for-dollar investments you can make. I mean, for the price of ONE barber cut, you can easily pay for this gadget !! ONE !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...not to mention the time you save going there - and WAITING there !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - and believe me, there is always ONE person in the crew that has &#x27;the gift&#x27; for cutting hair.  WHO KNEW ?!?  ~:D</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one to follow the instructions word by word. ( before I even look at what I got in the package I read the instructions) and these &amp;#34;wireless clippers&amp;#34; left me looking like Foghorn Leghorn from the loony tunes. after a full 16 hours charge I eagerly started cutting my hair when I hear the dreadful sound of rpms dropping and noticing that the clippers were no longer at full power. I plugged it into the wall outlet and for the first 9 seconds it would go full power but then slow to a shimmy shimmy so that when I tried cutting my hair with it you could hear hair ripping apart like last week&#x27;s edition of the NY times. (and it hurt too). I guess I could say my unintended skrillex haircut makes me look &amp;#34;hip&amp;#34;, but my experience is not something I wish you, kind buyer reading this. best of luck.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Perfectly described in the ad</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a safe buy. It is terrible and pulls hair. This is not my first set. I&#x27;m not inexperienced. My original clippers are great but are currently packed away due to our move. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Does what I ask of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind: the lowest setting on the &amp;#34;taper control&amp;#34; lever on the side does not give you a really close shave. This trimmer is perfect if you wanna trim your beard and still keep, for example, a 5-days&#x27; stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT the trimmer for you if you wanna shave your beard as close as a regular shaving blade.</li>
    <li> Could be better. I keep my hair short cutting about every two weeks with a #2. Hair gets caught in blades when I go at the normal pace. Work fine if you move slow just expect more time to cut hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several clipper over time, this is the best. Conair has made some good changes to the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; that affect the length of cut. They are of a sturdier construction.</li>
    <li> It came to me as advertised.  I plugged it in and it works perfectly.  Being cordless makes it easy to use on myself.</li>
    <li> A very complete kit. It&#x27;s all you need to cut hair with. It comes with easy to follow instructions. Very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> great hair cutter for the price and comes with everything you need to.</li>
    <li> Good value-quality product-happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good value!!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the price and value of this kit. It does charge just fine, has a variety of accessories and is easy to use. I have no concerns with recommending this for those who want to work at home on the hair trimming. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Works ok, But it does not really meet my expectation. When I charged the Hair Clipper it didn&#x27;t last long. So I plug it when using it so it does not live and works half way. Fine and not that super fine.</li>
    <li> Worked great the first few times. I was more than satisfied with it. But it seemed like it didn&#x27;t want to hold a charge. After about 10 uses, it will only last like 3 minutes after being left on the charger all day. Good initial price, but now just a waste of money...</li>
    <li> Was expecting a better outcome. These clippers with several hours of charge was not able to hold enough to cut anyone&#x27;s hair, terrible battery. Giving it a 3 star since I owned better conair products</li>
    <li> Cutting your own hair, you must utilize your sense of touch.  I have bought at least 3 sets of clippers in the past 22 years of cutting my own hair.  It can be done with a cord, but cordless is better.&lt;br /&gt;As a barber with only me as a customer, I have graduated past mirrors 20 years ago. Now I can cut my hair in the bathtub (empty) with less cleanup than near the outlet and vanity.  These are pretty new, so no comment on durability yet.</li>
    <li> Great item at great price.</li>
    <li> Limited cutting power.</li>
    <li> Working good but battery last for too short.</li>
    <li> It looks great but this is a gift.</li>
    <li> Good shaver.. would recommend</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I would like.</li>
    <li> It broke within a couple of months of infrequent use.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the military and he requires weekly trims to maintain his preferred style. I used to dread Fridays. Extension cords, hair everywhere, the inability to walk around him because he would sit on the edge of the bathtub. No more!&lt;br /&gt;Now I grab the trash bag/cape, a chair, a brush and the clipper along with the 1 and 2 guards and head outside. We can cut, edge and simply shake it off!&lt;br /&gt;Even if this thing does break in 6 weeks, it&#x27;s cheaper than 6 weeks worth of haircuts ($8 ea. plus tip)</li>
    <li> Good price- powerful and long run time without the cord. Plus I like the fact that you can use it with or without the cord. All around very good appliance.</li>
    <li> I read the manual and it said to leave it charging for at least 16 hours before the first use. I did. After that, I was ready to use it for the first time. I figured I&#x27;d get a good 20 minutes with it working cordless, but I was wrong. I used it for about 5-10 minutes and noticed that the clippers were slowing down. I did not get the trim I wanted because I was in a hurry and did not want to get stuck with my hair just being half cut. While I was hurrying, it seemed to be getting stuck and pulling my hair. I have very thin hair, so I didn&#x27;t know why it was doing this. Besides that, it comes with a lot of extras, which was nice.</li>
    <li> The charging light is &#x27;red&#x27; and stays on when charging. With cell phones, the red charging light turns green when charged. With computers, the red light turns green when charged. However, the Conair&#x27;s red charging light stays on while and even if it&#x27;s charged after many hours.</li>
    <li> Good unit, needs shorter comb lengths though.</li>
    <li> Great clippers and great price. Had the older model of this that lasted me 15 years of free haircuts around the world. Hope this one is just as good!</li>
    <li> This is awesome I love that it&#x27;s cordless. I like it a lot that I don&#x27;t have to fumble around with a cord.</li>
    <li> Light weight plastic feels cheap, but makes it easier to use. I cannot attest to how it does with longer cuts, but it has done 3 (cordless) shaves of (head and beard) on one charge and still going. To get closest shave, you must adjust lever on side (nowhere near razor close of course, but about the same as Wahl). Conair may not be quite as powerful as Wahl, but is less irritating on skin, not nearly as loud, and the colorful combs from Wahl fit Conair perfectly (purple comb attached to Conair in photo is from Wahl). I did not buy clipper from Amazon as price was about the same at local grocery store.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for. made of plastic but being able to use wireless or corded is definatly worth it.</li>
    <li> used it once, but so far so good.  Seems to be very high quality, powerful convenient.</li>
    <li> very bad!&lt;br /&gt;It can not be charged at all.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It is easy to use, the instructions are clear and is very comfortable the cordless function.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just propose it to my friends because it&#x27;s so strong and so good</li>
    <li> The best for the price and its cordless</li>
    <li> Great little setup if you like cutting your own hair at home.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. I dont have the issue of long cords that get tangled.</li>
    <li> I bought it and been using it from couple months. I cuts the hair in the way we do it. Its simply great as its cordless and its recharging capability is good. We can even carry it anywhere in the world and ofcourse u need a power converter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiran Gollamudi</li>
    <li> Not extremely powerful but will get the job done.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my 15 yr old grandson.  I give a short hair cut and then he fine tunes it.  Very easy to use, lightweight, and performs wonderfully.</li>
    <li> easy to use and charge last a long time</li>
    <li> Well, I used this one to cut my hair by myself.&lt;br /&gt;Eh...according to my previous experience, it works quite well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool, not the best, but it&#x27;ll get the job done!</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair using the razor with one of the attachments.  My old one was not working well anymore so I bought this and it works worse than the one it replaced.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it works, simple lightweight, gets the job done</li>
    <li> This product is great the battery has lasted a long time and the cutters do their jobs very well. I love all the attachments as well as the case that they can be placed in and ready to travel</li>
    <li> UPDATED OCT. 2015: Conair replaced the entire set for free and repaid me for shipping it back to them. That was good customer service. Lots of work for a cheaper item, but I&#x27;m happy with the working one that I have now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;Did not work from day one, right out of the box. However, I didn&#x27;t discover that until my window to return it passed. It&#x27;s probably a fluke, but I am not happy as a loyal Amazon customer for nearly 20 years...</li>
    <li> I have owned them all since I have been shaving my head for about the last 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much... but WOW!  What power!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one awesome clipper.  I&#x27;m ordering another one for my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing now for about 90 days. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better clipper. At a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This Product are really Poor quality, really nothing and unusable. Totally I am upset with all Amazon Product. This product even can not to cut one peace of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair and it worked perfectly. It is very lightweight and easy to handle. It has lots and lots of extra stuff in the kit.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  Fast charge.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected with shaving</li>
    <li> For the price I paid for this, it is a good purchase. Although the battery doesn&#x27;t hold charge that much, but pluged in no problem.</li>
    <li> I so wanted to say this is a great item.  It&#x27;s a great concept but these clippers lack a lot.  I used them once and they seemed to bog down.  The second time i tried to use them they would not cut.</li>
    <li> The idea of these clippers is great, I really liked the cordless operation. However even when cutting slow the clippers would tug on my hair. I also tried plugging them into wall power for full power and unfortunately they still tugged on my hair. I would recommend a Wahl lithium ion cordless set or corded set for a slightly higher price.</li>
    <li> Love it, but make sure you read the instructions and unpack this well before you plan to use it</li>
    <li> It came quickly and allows me to avoid the barber, hair cut in six bits time.</li>
    <li> Does its job,  good price!</li>
    <li> The Conair worked alright the first couple times I used it, but after that it effectively stopped working. The motor still ran and the blade still seemed to work, but it could barely cut through any amount of hair. I would recommend the Wahl 24-Piece set instead.</li>
    <li> I recently cut hair very short. My wife was having a problem in cutting my hair that short. This trimmer comes with many attachments so choosing therightlength of hair is perfect.</li>
    <li> Really great set for the price better than anything in store and had a lot of combs</li>
    <li> My husband had a previous version of this cutter, he likes to do his own to save money.  our previous model lasted forever (at least 6-10 years) and he accidently dropped it so we replaced it with the same model.  The only issue we have had is when it is charging we can hear a slight buzzing sound which can be annoying, but it cuts well and is very durable.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend just love it</li>
    <li> Blades did not seem sharp out of the box. The trimmer pulled hair even when moving slowly versus cutting cleanly. Battery power was great and easily lasted for multiple hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Perfect for home use.  Rechargeable, cordless clippers with a nice assortment of attachments and haircut tools.  Even found a specific U-Tube video that demonstrated cutting techniques using the various attachments.  Makes cutting your hair at home virtually foolproof which saves time and money (waited in a \\&quot;hairstylist\\&quot; shop and paid $15-20 plus tip for a trim lately?).</li>
    <li> It works well so far.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of it. It&#x27;s very powerful. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;It came in a box with all the different heads and cleaning supplies.</li>
    <li> Not as cheap feeling as the price tag might suggest. The plastic box is flimsy, but that&#x27;s expected. The machine itself works well, holds a decent charge, and comes with plenty of additions. Yes, it does come with everything you need to give a decent haircut and save yourself 10 bucks... or make yourself 10 bucks...</li>
    <li> Men, you can do your own haircut with this. I watched hours of YouTube videos, to get the gist of it. The clippers are excellent and the battery lasted beyond the 30 minutes I spent on that first attempt. Key is not to take off too much at once, so you can keep going back at it. After a while you get a feel for it.</li>
    <li> Gift for my son and he is really pleased with it. Great as can be used in the UK as well as USA - not all models are dual voltage so can be taken to Europe when traveling</li>
    <li> We bought Conair&#x27;s cordless clippers and used it about 10-12 times. Last week it failed, and the reason it failed is that the entire tension of a major spring (photo label A) which keeps the cutter blade in place was being held down by this tiny plastic tab (photo label B). Really? Is that all we get for our money is 12 cuts before an under-designed plastic tab fails? That frail plastic tab is thinner than the steel spring it is supposed to be restraining. The blades are still sharp, the battery is good, the motor runs perfectly, most of the accessories have never been used, and the shaver is now trash because this little plastic tab broke and the cutter blade just rattles around inside the case. Warranty? It will cost us more in time, trouble, and shipping than we paid for it. Went into the trash this morning.</li>
    <li> Cordless so maybe that is why it doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that strong but it got the job done eventually.</li>
    <li> I can maintain a hard-on longer than this thing can maintain a charge...and I&#x27;m 53!</li>
    <li> Like it much better than other leading brand.  Less vibration and smooth operation.  Less price.  What else can you want.</li>
    <li> These clippers have no power, plugged in or not. They would pull my hair instead of cutting. Never had this happen with any other clippers, even cordless ones. Used twice, first time I thought they may need to charge even though I had plugged in the whole time I used them. Second time was just as bad, immediately bought a different pair.</li>
    <li> The charge doesn&#x27;t last PERIOD! Don&#x27;t buy it...</li>
    <li> I expected more power than this device could provide. The blades quickly bind with hair when using at the shortest setting. It feels like the clipper blades &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; the hair and pulls it out versus cutting cleanly. I would look for a device with more power and cleaner cutting performance.</li>
    <li> Works great I&#x27;m very happy. The last one I got lasted 15 years. Has saved me a fortune in haircuts.</li>
    <li> I love it holds a great charge. I have 3 boys and can do all 3 of them in one charge Great</li>
    <li> Great!!!! 1 month user&lt;br /&gt;(+) cordless, accessories, works how i expected.&lt;br /&gt;(-) at the moment….none</li>
    <li> The product itself is good but the battery is so bad.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for only couple months.&lt;br /&gt;I charged it full and I cannot finish my son hair cut!</li>
    <li> This is the my terrible experience with this hair cut set, i am unable to finish my hair cut, it stuck the hair and make me feel very painful, do NOT by this product any more.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter. She has six children. She has used it a few times. She is very happy.  Fast delivery and great seller.</li>
    <li> Did not work well. Got caught in the hair it was supposed to be trimming. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great and great price</li>
    <li> Fits the hand easily. Charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough, but with a cord that isn&#x27;t a problem. Accessories are okay, but the included scissors are not worth using. Plastic apron is poorly designed and doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do: keep the hair trimmings off the clothes. Safety clip for the blades is easy to remove and replace. About the same decibel level as other inexpensive trimmers.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair Great!I recommend!!Will not be disappointed when you receive the item in mail.And does what it should cut hair!</li>
    <li> ... but keep the charger close. It works fine for common usages but from day to day may not hold the charge forever. As for the product itself (cut quality and power), I can&#x27;t complain. Does what I need it to and for that, I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> The Clippers work great, however the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should. I purchased mine roughly 6 months ago</li>
    <li> I love it, as expected</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe they can sell this great product with all the attachments for such a cheap price.  It&#x27;s ideal for cutting your own hair!</li>
    <li> Excellent description according to the product, Very good and estilist finish for the product. The case it is not so luxury as was described it but works perfectly to keep safe the product for scracth and falls but things and accesories inside the case are not in the best arrengement.. Hair cut it is also ligth and its no wire presentation is helpfull</li>
    <li> Great product...ability to store charge is a great idea especially if you are travelling. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Great set for the $... You can charge them up and get 4-5 good cut&#x27;s before recharging. Has all of the basics, including all 8 guards and &#x27;ear shapers&#x27; and the &#x27;taper handle&#x27; works great!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1J5M031E0TI5I]]I have been cutting my own hair for the past few years. As you can see in the video I do not have any arms. Finding a pair of clippers that works well with my feet can actually be quite the challenge. I do not have the dexterity or degree of maneuverability using my feet that a hand has. These clippers are great because they are very small and very easy to handle; I&#x27;ve used larger pairs of clippers and very quickly they became rather heavy to hold and cumbersome to glide over around my head.    I can hold these clippers with just 1 foot between my big toe and index toe and cut my hair quite adroitly. With the bigger pair of clippers that I was using it would take me about half an hour to cut my hair; with the smaller clippers it takes me about 10 minutes. I only use the number two clipper but the number of clippers provided is quite numerous.    For me these clippers are a godsend and work flawlessly.

    <li> It did not work, so i can not say anything about the conair ultra cut haircut kit, 22- piece, verry bad</li>
    <li> Great hair clipper set! My hubby loves it! Also looks great!</li>
    <li> Be prepared to use it corded within a year.  The battery doesn&#x27;t hold any charge after a while, and I ended up using it plugged in all the time.  Otherwise, good product.</li>
    <li> Works great I love the fact its cordless</li>
    <li> SMALL AND COMPACT YET POWERFULL...</li>
    <li> Super handy since it&#x27;s cordless. It&#x27;s a bit noisier than my older set of clippers. I was expecting it to be quieter since it&#x27;s newer, but it def isn&#x27;t. For the price it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> This Conair cordless system works great.</li>
    <li> Used a nearly identical model for a few years and finally wore it out. Would have lasted longer but I dropped it several times (the head popped off when I dropped it, but I have always been able to get it back on and functional--though with increasing fit problems).&lt;br /&gt;Some care in handling the battery ensures plenty of run time (run it down completely or pretty close to completely from time to time, especially at first use). And I&#x27;ve also always been able to run it off the cord in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;I can usually get two or three cuts out of a charge, though these are fairly quick and simple cuts (#3 everywhere, #2 around the ears and to taper a bit in back, bare metal for close work here and there, that&#x27;s it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have no complaints about this model other than maybe that the container the kit comes in is kind of annoying: opening on both sides is just awkward. But a bit of \\&quot;duck tape\\&quot; on one end and you have a nice (well, maybe not \\&quot;nice\\&quot; but fully operational) hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve just ordered a new one and plan to hang on the old for spare parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: new one just arrived. Happy to say I see only two differences 1. Chrome rather than gray. 2. The container the kit goes in is improved - handle on one end, hinge on the other. No more duct tape needed!</li>
    <li> Looking Clean baby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came with a cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> works for about 40min then drops dead</li>
    <li> Great product. easy to use</li>
    <li> Very satisfied shopper! Awesome product, works great, just as described, at a reasonable price and received the product in one piece within no time.</li>
    <li> My daughter was looking for a set to shave her boyfriend&#x27;s head rather than going to a barber every 3 weeks. I believe I paid less than 20 dollars for this and it has been used 10+ times already! Great value!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have a cordless set of clippers.  I&#x27;ve found that it works well without any guards on it.  However, once you put a guard on it, it&#x27;s almost worthless.  I guess it depends what you&#x27;re using it for.  I cut my own hair and my kids&#x27; hair and use guards every time.</li>
    <li> Have to give this 3 stars because the shaver kept pulling both my son and my husband&#x27;s hair, but not that often. Other than that this device is handy because it is rechargeable.  We also liked that it is lightweight and ergonomic.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better quality.</li>
    <li> It is not a professional haircut kit but still very good. I have used a few times and it works great!</li>
    <li> I only gave it 4 out of 5 because I was annoyed that when the first one stopped cutting as well as it did when new, replacement blades were not available.  Granted, this was after more than a year of frequent use and given that it cost less than a single trip to a salon, I consider that to be pretty good.  I was a little annoyed that for something that&#x27;s designed to cut hair, the drive isn&#x27;t sealed against little bit of hair and the drive eventually gets clogged up.  I cleaned my out several times, but eventually wound up just buying another one because the price is so good.  My desire to replace the original unit was a combination of the blades dulling and the motor not being able to run as fast because the drive was full of bits of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in China, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I estimate I saved hundreds of dollars and it doesn&#x27;t take all that long to cut your own hair, so I saved a lot of time as well.</li>
    <li> I made a bold risky move when I shaved the sides and back of my hair. I love it now, but I don&#x27;t have money or time to keep going back to the salon for touch ups. So I bought this. Now I can do my own hair when it starts to grow back in.</li>
    <li> Charge should last longer than 35 minutes other than that they are excellent for the price</li>
    <li> bought it a couple of weeks ago. It&#x27;s ok. At the lowest setting, which means I&#x27;m not using any cover, just the clipper straight up, it&#x27;s about a 1 I think.&lt;br /&gt;Was looking for a 0. But other than that, it works great. Feels solid in hand, ability to use wirelessly helps in not trying to navigate wires all the time. Overall, for $18 shipped, you can&#x27;t do much worse.</li>
    <li> It worked well for about a year, but then the battery started to die. Without use, the battery holds a charge for only a few hours before draining. During use, it lasts less than 15 minutes now, after a year of twice-monthly use. For the price, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to be great, but still disappointing. My next clippers will have lithium batteries. On the up-side, you can use them with the cord plugged in without relying on the battery at all.</li>
    <li> Works great fast shipping and exactly describe</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s exactly what i needed, and perfectly replaces the one my wife broke (don&#x27;t tell her I said that lol).  So far seems durable.  I only use it when I wanna cut off all my hair so I&#x27;m only rating the clippers itself, not all the other pieces and clips.  Even though I don&#x27;t use it, I love that it comes with smock (or whatever you call it).  I don&#x27;t know how long it holds a charge because I only plug it in when I use it and have never used it unplugged.  Gives me the perfect bald head for me, not the shiny baldy but the fuzzy baldy, which is just my personal preference.  I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love it even it seems the quility not really well. but it works really good. it saves a lot money on barborshop. i love it</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not the best quality</li>
    <li> Very nice. It works as I expected.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. Comes with many sized combs. Easy to use for a first timer like me. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> There is no neck brush!</li>
    <li> HI,i am very happy with my conair,was on time ,the price was good.,was what i was expecting in quailtynice looking(THANKS)DON</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper to give our maltipoo haircuts instead of going to the expensive groomers each month. The clipper costs as much as 1 groom, so, totally worth it. The Conair works great but you have to have a curve or hyperbolic type motion which I did not realize at first. Start by holding the clipper perpendicular to your pet then push thru with a u type motion for best results: perpendicular to parallel.</li>
    <li> These clippers don&#x27;t hold a charge for long and have very little power. I&#x27;ll continue to use them until I get fed up enough with the low power, but I would not recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> not sharp enough for thick hair</li>
    <li> Where do i start well the machine arrived thats good..when i first opened it felt like it was cheaply made..some reason the charger did not go in right had like a loose connection when i put to charge..did not like the machine will not recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and give a lot of haircuts to friends. Can be used plugged in or battery. Battery lasts 2 haircuts.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, Good Quality.</li>
    <li> 3rd time I used it, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I plugged it in.  Battery was fine.  Something was wrong with the off/on switch.  Rather than file a warranty claim, I just threw it away.  What a waste.  Buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and does the job right. I usually cut my hair short and simple so I didn&#x27;t try various lengths and options.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for home hair trimming needs.</li>
    <li> You only get one clip, don&#x27;t get cheated.</li>
    <li> The clipper has a fatal design flaw.  There is a big gap between blades and handle and tons of hair had been accumulated there after a few hair cuttings.  I have to unscrew the blades and tried every ways to get rid of the hair inside the handle.  Very frustrated.  My first clipper was WAHL and I used it for over 10 years (I cut my kids&#x27; hair at home).  I don&#x27;t think I want to keep this for much longer considering I have to open it once a while to clean out all those hair hiding inside the clipper.</li>
    <li> Used this product many times, it works so good</li>
    <li> I use this about once or twice a month to trim my puppy, and it works very well.  The attachments are a little cheesy and I don&#x27;t use them, but for the price, they&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> Just bought this to do my son and my husbands hair at home. With the price, I could not complain. It was cheaper than one trip to the barber. The design is sleek with the chrome handle. I love that I can charge it and use it cordless. The first time I used it, both boys hair had grown quite a bit but it did not snag at all. The blades were sharp and cut through the hair effortlessly. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. Not having a cord in the way is a delight and makes cutting my hair easier and faster. It gives you full power long enough for you to do what you got to do. You want to plug this back in to charge right after use so it&#x27;s ready when you need it again. Don&#x27;t have any complains.</li>
    <li> Light weight cuts clean and lots of assories included, Has a fairly short battery life, rechargeble.  But can be plug in and uses that way also.  Charge time is very short.  Very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> My old Wahl corded clipper finally gave up the ghost. The 22 piece battery rechargeable Conair was about 1/3 the price of the cordless Wahl at my local Walmart. I was very pleasantly surprised by the substantial, balanced weighting of the Conair. The black blade adjustment lever clicks into place and holds, unlike my old corded Wahl which I locked into place by wrapping electrical tape around it. The Conair does not make much noise, though when cutting my hair I wear foam earplugs for hearing protection and to keep canals free from clippings. I was also impressed by the large variety of clipper combs. At this point, after one use, my only minor complaint/concern is that the clipper comb attachments are more difficult to lock on and remove than the Wahl. This might mitigate with use. Even though I have a GFCI plug, the cordless battery function is doubly reassuring on the safety front, and not having a cord to mind is a pleasure.</li>
    <li> When me and my partner first starting cutting each other&#x27;s hair we had no idea what quality clippers were...until we bought this garbage. Worked flawlessly for about 2 weeks and then started to make a very loud grinding noise every time we turned them on, we cleaned and oiled EVERY time we used them so this wasn&#x27;t a maintenance thing...they&#x27;re just not good. Also, there is this hole on the underside of the blade that&#x27;s hallowed out and allows a BUNCH of hair to get trapped inside the handle part with no real way to clean it, which is just unsanitary. Another issue I had was the guide combs don&#x27;t &#x27;lock&#x27; into place onto the clipper, so what happens is it&#x27;s kind of a hassle to get the guide comb aligned with the blade. Haircuts were inconsistent when using the cordless feature, the battery would deplete to what felt and sounded like 50% power after about 2 minutes of use EVERYTIME we tried to use them this way. Don&#x27;t get tricked by a gimmick, if you want a sharp looking clean cut that doesn&#x27;t look like you took a hacksaw to your head then try something that has a bigger name in men&#x27;s hair tools. We used a small peanut style Wahl clipper to blend the different lengths of our hair and we really liked it so went on to purchase a Wahl clipper with color guides...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with the Wahl color guided one the combs snap into place with no wiggle room on either side, there&#x27;s no dramatic grinding sound, the hair cuts are clean and even, even the consistency of the blade movement is impressive, it just feels like a solid machine in your hand, much more durable than our plastic-y/loud Conair Cordless Clipper...as my partner put it the ease of the cut is comparable to \\&quot;A hot knife through butter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not trying to sell you on Wahl, but just don&#x27;t waste your time, money or efforts on this Conair junk...I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast on this item. when I received it I had to try it out and it cuts perfect. will recommend to others</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a much heavier and older Conair unit I had.  It works great cutting hair, and you can do a full haircut if you charge it that morning.  If you charge it when finished and think it will be ready for next time, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  If you&#x27;re lucky it will run 30 seconds.  Don&#x27;t know if my battery is a dud, or if this is just the way it is with all of them.  Spend a little more and get one with Lithium Ion batteries.</li>
    <li> Great hair clippers. Battery life is xcellent.</li>
    <li> Stopped working suddenly. Also, I had to keep it plugged in constantly because it would not function otherwise. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Having reached that stage in life where the amount of hair needing cutting is minimal, I purchased these clippers so my son could put on one short blade to give me that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; look.  Excellent clippers at a great price.</li>
    <li> I like to cut my own hair I get it just the way I want it when I want.</li>
    <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack (it will cost me 20$). Please dont trust Conair.</li>
    <li> hair gets jammed in it way too easy, halting the blade most of the time. The lever on the side feels like it&#x27;s going to snap off when ever I try to move it around. The kit is still great though, and It holds a charge just fine (&amp;#62;7 minutes of constant use out of this one on a full charge). Scissors came SHARP.</li>
    <li> I have bought less expensive clippers that don&#x27;t pinch and pull hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, ConAir has a bad item here we can only hope that they will improve quality if they wish to keep customers.</li>
    <li> Battery is pretty weak, holds the charge for a short period</li>
    <li> Light weight no hanging electric cords to tangle while cutting hair. Quiet and cool very compact. Wife loves these features as this replaced a older model we had for many Years. Thank You Conair as I don&#x27;t have to keep bugging to get My hair cut. That is because of the convenience and light weight of this Haircut Tool.</li>
    <li> Great accessories, except for the flimsy plastic cape.</li>
    <li> Utter Garbage. Trimmer ok. Shears are worse than crap scissors that come in free hotel sewing kits. The combs are indescribably bad. Save your time and money.</li>
    <li> Used it a couple of times.  Works as intended.</li>
    <li> For years I used a $7 trimmer I got at Aldi&#x27;s years ago.  After many years of service, the motor finally got all loose sounding and eventually conked out.  That&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;ll buy this nice new shiny rechargeable version...  And what do you know... it&#x27;s terrible.  Weak, sloppy, wont hold a charge, junk.&lt;br /&gt;As I write this, Im shopping for a new one, again, because this is terrible and I refuse to use it any more.</li>
    <li> I could not get the product to cut hair evenly. It would leave patches and I would go over the area over and over again.</li>
    <li> Battery last more than 40 minutes, total set include many useful tool, 24 pieces.</li>
    <li> It is avery good Product with lot of attachement Combs. Perfect for any size cutting. Used it regularly. Easy to clean. Comes in a nice Box and easy to carry.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s hair grows at an unbelievable rate, and I have found that our busy schedule makes it hard to get in to see a barber as often as he needs.  With that in mind I bought these clippers so I could give haircutting a try on my own.  These were easy to use, and charged quickly so I could use the cord free option.  I would recommend them to anyone wanting to save a bit of time or money on simple male haircuts.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean, easy to shave. I have never been so well groomed. It cuts well, and was worth every penny. Great price for a super duper groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always insulted Conair for being such a cheap brand. But this is quality. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Conair rechargeable clipper set that lasted 12 years. I only used it to cut my husband and son&#x27;s hair, but was a great set.  This new set seems a little cheaply made, but I didn&#x27;t pay as much as the last set. Was worth the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great buy.  Good price and gets the job done.  I use it as a body and side burns trimmer, works way better than the ones made for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to replace an older Conair trimmer which became intermittent (but which I later fixed).  A lot of accessories came with this kit, most of which I will never use...it even came with an apron!  It also came with a durable hardshell case, all for only $20 including shipping.  The only disadvantage of this trimmer over my old one, is that it weighs about twice as much.  But it looks and feels like a very high-quality instrument, like you would find in a professional barber shop.  It even has an adjustment to control the amount of exposure for the trimmer blade.  One other note - the cutter speed seems to be a bit lower than my old one.  I thought about downgrading it one star because of the weight, but when I look at the &amp;#34;big picture&amp;#34;, the value is certainly there and it is really worth what I paid</li>
    <li> Best rechargeable that I&#x27;ve had in a while.</li>
    <li> Used twice. The third time it wouldn&#x27;t so muchncut my hair as it would rip it. Total waste, do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;Get Remington or wahl</li>
    <li> great buy use it every 2 weeks and i charge after 2 hair cuts but battery is still got juice</li>
    <li> great product very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> The clippers have paid for itself, how could I not be happy?</li>
    <li> Go cordless. Once you go cordless you never go back to cord. Place in charger over night and you are ready to cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;Dwight Hunter, Buyer</li>
    <li> This is a piece of cheap junk. If you don&#x27;t use the attachments it&#x27;s not too bad but once you put on an attachment it pulls as many hairs out as it cuts! Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> it was good but have a rare noise too hard i dont like it</li>
    <li> Works fine with no problems or issues. I would like it more if the cutting width were a little larger</li>
    <li> This kit is good. It is little bit hard to clean it but that is fine. The plastic &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34; or how to call it that is used for cover of clothes when you are shaving is really bad. It is like a plastic bag from stop and shop and here you are put it on. But i didn&#x27;t order that, I ordered a shaver and the shaver is good. Especially for fades because of the lever you have on side of it.</li>
    <li> Cuts as good as anyone clippers I&#x27;ve used, and has all the parts you would need to cut any kind of style you want.</li>
    <li> l like because u can take apart the blade without tools. It is to esay clean to it</li>
    <li> Only cut in bursts, which didn&#x27;t prevent it being able to cut hair, but decreased efficiency. A bit over halfway in my first use it fell apart, and I&#x27;ve not been able to put it back together. This may or may not be typical, but whereas my specific experience is concerned no more than one star is not appropriate.</li>
    <li> The Wahl cordless haircutter I had for years gave out and I bought this Conair kit because it cost only 1/3 as much, and had pretty good reviews here on Amazon.  Well, I was amazed at how poorly it cuts compared to the Wahl.  I just do a #2 buzz, which is usually dead simple, but I had to go over my hair 10-20 times with this cutter to get it to cut evenly.  With the Wahl it was just one pass and done.  This cutter is so cheap it already paid for itself in one haircut, but since I value my time, I&#x27;m going to throw this away and get another Wahl.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Good buy and easy to use .it was with cord and cordless too that makes it great for daily use.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what we wanted for a fair price.</li>
    <li> I ordered these and when I opened the box there was someone else&#x27;s hair in the comb! Gross!</li>
    <li> works great, only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is it can hurt when trimming my bear (feels like the hair is getting pulled) and also it is not as powerful when not plugged in, I guess thats probably typical</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for less than two years. The battery runs low before I can give myself a quick brush-cut. I know about Ni-Cads and their memory problem so after it starts running low I just let it run until it&#x27;s completely dead. Then I charge it overnight. Guess I&#x27;ll have to get a lith-Ion one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this inexpensive set of clippers to use in trimming up my goats. We don&#x27;t have electricity in our barns, so I wanted cordless clippers. The clippers are quiet, and I have yet to run down a fully charged set trimming my 4 goats. The only thing I wish they had was some sort of indicator so that you would know when they are fully charged. As it is, I usually just charge them overnight the day before grooming day.</li>
    <li> it is okay. not waterproof</li>
    <li> I bought it for cutting the hair for my husband.  It works and save money and time.  Hope it can be long last at least one-two years.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut hair but it pulls it.</li>
    <li> the battery doesn&#x27;t last long but at least it let&#x27;s you cut as it&#x27;s plugged in, which my previous conair refused to do.</li>
    <li> Great!!!! Works like it&#x27;s plugged in, nice not to deal with freaking cords!And lasts for awhile!</li>
    <li> Great buy for persons needing to get &amp;#34;buzz haircuts&amp;#34;....</li>
    <li> Not good as the hairdresser&#x27;s tools, but worth the price.</li>
    <li> This cordless is great the design makes it very easy to cut my own hair very good deal for the price</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even shave my beard propely.</li>
    <li> Battery life is not as expected. Lasted maybe 10 minutes after being on the charger for over 12 hours</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS WAHL...</li>
    <li> Great! For the price this is top of the list! I cut my husband&#x27; s hair with conair ultra cut and it was so easy to use. Don&#x27; t think about it, just buy it!</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers because I was tired of shelling out $20 every month for a haircut. Furthermore, I was trying to wear my hair a little differently and the stylists just didn&#x27;t seem to get what I was going for (most likely my own fault). I was just sick of going to get my haircut. So I watched some YouTube videos on cutting your own hair and decided I was going to take the plunge and start cutting my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these because they were super cheap. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot in case cutting my own hair ended up being a huge mistake. Also they&#x27;re cordless which I need because I don&#x27;t have an outlet in my bathroom. I have been using them for 3 months now and can say they have met and exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to use the clip on attachments (numbered 1-8) to fade the sides and back of my head nicely. The blade is adjustable, so even with a clip on attachment you can still alter the length of that attachment. For example, if you&#x27;re using a #2 attachment you can adjust the length from a short #2 to a longer #2. It&#x27;s helpful for fading. Rather than blocking my neckline off in a square or rounded shape, I taper my neckline down to 0. I am able to get a smooth fade down to 0 with these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first haircut took me a long time because I didn&#x27;t really have my technique down pat. It took over an hour and the clippers eventually died out on me. Now I have my haircut down to 20-30 minutes and have had no problems with these clippers dying out on me. I do leave them on the charger over night after my haircut. I have really thick hair and have not experienced any pulling with these clippers. They come with all the attachments, a pair of scissors, the charger, two combs, a cape, and a brush and oil for cleaning and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m super happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ve never used any expensive brand of clippers, but I wonder how much better can they actually be? Perhaps when these clippers need replacing I will buy a more expensive brand, but for now these work perfectly for my needs. If you are looking for a cheap pair of cordless clippers then I would highly recommend this set. And if you are debating cutting your own hair I say go for it! In three months these clippers have paid for themselves and saved me money on going to the hairstylist. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as other razors. The battery life is excellent however.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Seems flimsy. Wondering how long ut will last. Nice price though.</li>
    <li> The clipper works well and has a lot of attachments for length.  I got it because I wanted a cordless.  The only drawback is it won&#x27;t shave close</li>
    <li> gift for son for Christmas. he seems to enjoy at college and now he and his friends now are trim and looking good.</li>
    <li> Battery life is terrible!  Four months after I purchased this clipper the battery will only last five minutes . . . at best!!!!  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> works really well thanks</li>
    <li> Light weight and easy to operate.</li>
    <li> Was only good for about 6 months - now it can&#x27;t be recharged (battery doesn&#x27;t hold charge) and I have to use it plugged in. Which defeats the purpose of rechargeable. It works fine plugged in. I just need a rechargeable.</li>
    <li> very handy stuff, I like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve held many clippers and didn&#x27;t expect these to be so lightweight allowing you to move very easily. The clippers are also about standard size which is nice.</li>
    <li> Grandson likes keeping his hair short and this is so easy for him to do himself.</li>
    <li> Lasted me 3 uses. The product will not charge whatsoever. The battery just drains completely. I cannot even use the clipper with the cord plugged in. This was quite unexpected and disappointing.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut my hair really good on the longer settings.  Feels cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to get another #2 Trimmer piece as mine had been dropped and it broke a few teeth off. Anyway,  It&#x27;s nice to see that the new model has Trimmer lengths that still fit the old model.  Conair is good stuff in my book. Been using my first purchase for at least 5 years now, maybe 10 (time flies). Still using the original one, will keep the new one in the cabinet until I need it.</li>
    <li> Convenient, Gave it as a gift, Great Buy</li>
    <li> I got this to cut my own hair and it works just fine. Definitely a value for my case since I just buzz all my hair at once. The downside is that it takes a long time to charge and the battery does not last as long as you would expect.</li>
    <li> Had older conair clippers so tried this as a replacement.  Really nice clippers.  Holds a charge and easy to use.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to order these.  You will like them.</li>
    <li> The haircutter works very well.  The person whose hair I was cutting said he couldn&#x27;t feel the blades - no tugging on his hair or feeling like it might nick his skin (and this was using it without any attachment).  It fits in my hand and isn&#x27;t heavy, though it also doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy.  There were some other reviews about whether it would work in Europe or other places using 220/240 electricity.  Yes - it works just fine.  It states it can accept 110 - 220 input.  You only need to get an adapter plug, the same as you do for your cellphone charger.</li>
    <li> The item is light weight and easy to use. Very sturdy build and solid handling. The entire package comes with a good assortment of attachments and this is a great value. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good product, its proper to use it yourself at home and all the tools are very useful, 100% recommended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 16 years and I was excited to try out some wireless clippers because the cord is annoying.  These clippers look good, but they pulled my hair like crazy.  I would not recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Received it on time, well worth the price. comes with scissors, 2 fine combs, and much more.</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065IBKK/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing better than using a quality product like Conair 22 piece cord/cordless hair kit to touch up between haircuts or personal grooming. With 22 attachments and safety guides in minutes you have the look and feel of a day at the spa.</li>
    <li> It works, but its not the best trimmer there is.&lt;br /&gt;it also feels rather cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I mean you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> very good,exactly what I need</li>
    <li> Very nice clipper. Works great.</li>
    <li> shiping so fast  .very nice stuff  love item</li>
    <li> As a hair clipper, this is very good. Works with both 110 and 220 vac. Can be used while plugged in or without the power adapter if battery is charged</li>
    <li> great clipper. lots of attachments, comparable to any Wahl I have owned or used; cordless is nice.</li>
    <li> I am using this to give myself great haircuts. The added attachments even give me a good taper on the side.</li>
    <li> Pretty good my husband loved it thanks.</li>
    <li> So far this has worked amazing! I will admit to being skeptical of the charging at first but it works great! It holds the charge for a long time. I use it on my facial hair all the time and I occasionally cut my own hair, making the cordless feature such a blessing.</li>
    <li> Seem ok for the price. Have used it a few times for my family and works good so far!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s cordless but the battery stopped holding a charge after about 3 uses. It isn&#x27;t all that sharp either when cutting hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good deal on clippers. The only issue here is they don&#x27;t have the closest trim. If you&#x27;re looking to just cut hair you&#x27;re fine, but don&#x27;t expect to be able to shave or get any line work done with these.</li>
    <li> Once you buy/use a cordless trimmer you&#x27;ll wonder what took you so long to get one.</li>
    <li> I like this Conair cordless trimmer. Lots of accessories to fit any haircut you want. Charge last through a couple of sessions and has performed fine. I recommend this  - a great value for the price!</li>
    <li> This haircut kit works great. Good grip, And I like the wireless most. Its lenght combs are great.&lt;br /&gt;but every time battery charged (16hrs +), only able to cut 2 haircuts.</li>
    <li> Bought this clipper set 10 months ago  to replace our old Wahl  clippers because they had been  broken during a move. From the very first use  these conair  clippers did not cut hair well. It left hair sticking out so I had to make several passes... and I do mean several . Our old clippers were used at least once a week every week for straight 7 years ( I am not exaggerating that one bit , my husband was a Marine and haircuts among many other things were enforced,  I cut his hair every Sunday.)  I was ticked off at how bad these &amp;#34;new clippers&amp;#34; were cutting. My son hated it as I think it pulled his hair because he did not mind our old clippers. We could not return them because we got them at a kmart that was closing down so all sales were final... we paid $25 for this set at the time. I used this new  clipper set 2-3 times a month.. The idea of it being able to be used both cord/cordless was cool . HOWEVER  here it is 10 months old  and Im pretty sure the battery is done.... I go to use them  realize the battery isnt charged...so I plug it in to the wall to  use corded like I had done before and it should be able to do.... it comes on slows  down quickly  and halts ( like the way it acts when the battery is dying when using cordless) Um hello Im plugged into the wall this shouldnt happen. It is likely&lt;br /&gt;because the battery may be no good anymore . They just dont make things like they used to ..its sad</li>
    <li> I have owned my conair cordless clippers for years now.. Not sure if this is exactly the same model, but i have never had a problem with mine. Just plug in the night before and.. Bam! Holds the charge thru my whole haircut, which i do myself, using bathroom mirror and a handheld. I have used them every other month now for about seven years, and still have lubricating oil left in the tube (it doesn&#x27;t take a lot each time). It takes me around a half hour to do the cut and the attachments stay on.. On previous wahl clippers i had problems with the attachments coming off, or not going on straight..which can be scary! I give these five stars because they are durable (dropped mine during my last cut and the top came off, but snapped back in and i was able to finish my cut), and the price is super inexpensive for cordless (less than two cuts or maybe even one..and the clippers have paid for themselves compared to what salons charge)!! Definitely recommend! I will be buying another of these to replace the one i dropped for sure!</li>
    <li> Left how my husband called it, &amp;#34;corn mazes in his hair&amp;#34;.  Was returned and will look for another haircut kit.</li>
    <li> Great and good price too...thanks</li>
    <li> Easy to use but so much hair was trapped inside clippers I had to dismantle them to clean.</li>
    <li> bad product, don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Great price and very good product. The charge and run time is great in this shaver and the chrome finish makes it a very classy product. I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times but I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Even after only one use, I didn&#x27;t care for the fact that I had to use the brush to clean the cutter pretty often.</li>
    <li> It works in a bind but you can definitely tell the difference between a plug-in one and this cordless one. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good. This ítem is What i have been waiting for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to cut my hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. Wish I had bought a better brand. It pulls as much beard as it cuts. Not good</li>
    <li> This product works just fine, I was looking for a little closer cut but I&#x27;m fine with this.</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work. We have had great success with Conair brand clippers in the past, but this one pulls the hair and barely cuts. It&#x27;s worthless.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have had 6 haircut kits and this far and away the best one and at an unbeatable price. Love the sturdy, sleek design of the clippers and being cordless is a necessity since I cut my own hair (and help friends cut theirs, or let them do it themselves).  The contoured design makes it easy to hold in any position and the wide selection of strong, snap-on guards makes it effortless to cut and blend hair to achieve any style. Currently I cut my hair in a mohawk of various lengths and configurations and accomplish this quickly, easily and with perfectly straight lines. Easy to keep clean and comes in a nice storage case. This set replaces a Remington HC5550 which was not only more difficult to use, but the guards had widely spaced teeth so when I cut my hair, it left distinctive lines, like I had plowed a field and was going to plant rows of corn. On top of that, the teeth on the guards started breaking off after the first use.  Needless to say, THAT clipper set was returned real quick-like.</li>
    <li> The device is heavier than I would like. I bought this as a replacement for another brand that had been lost in a move. My only experience with it is using it to cut fine, thinning hair, and for that use, I am very disappointed in its performance. It needs many passes over the same area to ensure all the hairs have been cut.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Personally, I liked it a lot. It worked better than my 5yr old conair clippers, and the battery worked better.</li>
    <li> good price and functions as well as any I have owned to date. I have not been to the barber in 32 years so I use clippers frequently. I would say these are a real bargain and light weight. I can&#x27;t speak for the durability yet but so far I am very pleased and would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;A good dollar value.......</li>
    <li> Very powerful clipper, cordless is the best, y make my hair done in just 15 - 20 minutes, much better than my older clipper</li>
    <li> Work pretty good, and feel nice in your hands. Does not hold a charge for crap. Within 2 minutes of unplugging and using you can tell it is losing charge from the sound alone. Soon after you will notice more tugging and pulling of hair as it struggles to cut. Works much better if it remains plugged in, but then, why buy a cordless clipper?</li>
    <li> Good quality, excellent value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using this product for a long time. It&#x27;s very affordable. I bring it with me when I travel here and abroad, to Europe, Asia, it&#x27;s multi use 110/220 volts,&lt;br /&gt;No problem, very light and easy to use! Just love it!</li>
    <li> Works fine, great for the money. Make sure you charge it 24hrs before using first time. Runs ok and is comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> It was like in the picture</li>
    <li> I was buying this to replace another Conair that I have used for years. My old one had a nice metal case to organize all the parts. In comparison this is packed in a smaller plastic case without any inserts to hold anything in place. The unit itself is smaller and lighter with a cheaper feel. The cape is not much more than a plastic bag. The blades don&#x27;t seem to cut as well either. On the other side the price wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> this clipper is really bad; it keeps pulling my hair. Just invest the money and buy yourself a walch brand</li>
    <li> Very nice to be able to use these clippers without the restraint of a cord, but the cord can be used if desired. Sharp blades, excellent selection of blade attachments and very light in weight. Good price for the product.</li>
    <li> For the low price this thing is awesome. If you&#x27;re looking for something to trim body hair or give yourself a haircut this item is great. I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times now and I don&#x27;t regret the purchase at all.</li>
    <li> I have used clippers for over 20 years and prefer the rechargeable type.  I have had the Conair brand for this entire time and have the original clippers from 20 years ago.  The original clippers do not recharge anymore but still cut if the electric cord is attached.  Update  These clippers stopped working after 2 years.</li>
    <li> Does a good job at cutting my hair! Not the best out there but for the money it is the best bag for your buck!</li>
    <li> This was helpful for me to do my first clients haircut. My client was very pleased and will be back for another haircut. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The razor arrived defective has isolated the button to adjust the blade can not be used to repair debi send me appalled buy a product and having to make additional charges for defects</li>
    <li> I would have given this product &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; stars if I could.  Had been using a Sunbeam clipper for many years to cut my own hair.  It needed to be replaced and chose the Conair.  What a mistake.  It does not cut hair it pulls it.  This horrible clipper should be removed from the market!</li>
    <li> Bought this so I could cut my husband&#x27;s hair when he started losing it during chemo. Love that this can be used with or without cord. Love the different attachments but I won&#x27;t use them since my husband keeps his hair short. Holds charge really well. Blades do get hot quicker than another brand I have which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> We had to return it because when we used it  , the footplate got very warm and uncomfortable.  Don&#x27;t know if it was defective or if all the cordless units do this.</li>
    <li> Good cheap hair clippers for all your hair clipping needs.</li>
    <li> Very good I really like it.</li>
    <li> Lowest setting is way to long for me... If you shave short, not for you.  Otherwise, quality and many options seemed great</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the quality of this along with the accessories that it comes with is impeccable.</li>
    <li> Well satisfied! Its great!!</li>
    <li> Hoping this unit will last, it feels a bit on the cheap side, but it works as intended.</li>
    <li> Exactly what is advertised. Works great and finishing quality is good.</li>
    <li> The battery did not hold a charge after just a few months.</li>
    <li> Like several other reviewers, I found this item to be underpowered and essentially unusable. It would not hold a charge between uses, rendering the cordless function useless unless I planned to give a haircut about 24 hours in advance. The accessories are fine, but most of them are not terribly useful.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I always get conair clippers, I feel the blades are more comfortable. It seems like they are using very cheap materials now. Very light plastic. The blades are still comfy though and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for a quick shave in any area due to being cordless, has plenty of power and blades cut smooth not super quiet but not really loud. The main reason for me purchasing these was because they are cordless and they definitely met my expectations.</li>
    <li> so far everything has been very good</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I needed.  I scoured the market for a good solid basic electric razor that could be cordless, and this works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This seller got this to us promptly, but this just isn&#x27;t as good as our last set of clippers. Have only used twice and will definitely be replacing them as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> I bought a Conair and the battery life was very short. I took it back to the store and got a new one. That one was worse. It&#x27;s too bad because otherwise it could be a decent cutter. I&#x27;ll have to rate it a zero until they start making the charge last longer.</li>
    <li> It is good as expected.</li>
    <li> I Bought this good looking unit 1 year ago and it stops working in half way this morning. So I had to put on a cap and get another clipper from a local store, embarrassingly.&lt;br /&gt;This unit looks good by the first sight. No surprisingly, it gave a good performance for the first few times. Smoothly and precisely. I use it twice a month and maintain it after every use, of course, following the instruction. By now it dead after about 25 uses.&lt;br /&gt;So I made a call to the customer service dept. of CONAIR. The interesting thing happened, the service rep didn&#x27;t recognize the model number HC318R which was engraved on the unit! After I attempted get her help to find the model number, she started to yell at me: I told you so many times, HC318R is not the model number. Try to find the model number and call this number again!!!  Do I deserve this? So I asked her to transfer me to her supervisor. The supervisor lady helped me nice and professionally. After I provided the model number - HC318R and the serial number, she confirmed that my unit is under warranty and gave me the solution.&lt;br /&gt;The solution:&lt;br /&gt;1. Provide all of my personal info to CONAIR, including email address. They will send me a instruction about where should I send the defected unit to. Nobody sent me a instruction until today, 3 days after.&lt;br /&gt;2. Send back the defected unit to them.&lt;br /&gt;3. Send a 3 dollar money order along with the unit to cover the shipping cost of replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, that is probably CONAIR&#x27;s policy of limited warranty which I assumed to agree with. But I will say I won&#x27;t send it back. I have to spend more than $10 dollar to get a replacement not to mention about the time that consumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my own solution. I bought a WAHL haircut kit and I will never touch CONAIR again.</li>
    <li> haircut  is good. the accessories are all complete.but I can&#x27;t say it is perfect. one of the accessory --the apron is too cheap and too small. I think it is a essential accessory. but I have to aknowledge that lots of the product --haircult even don&#x27;t contain any accessory.</li>
    <li> I gave up on &amp;#34;getting scalped&amp;#34; at salon after salon in vogue these days....no one seems to be able to give an older buy just a good standard haircut without scalping him, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.  With the help of my wife giving a final scissor trim across the bottom hairline above my neck when I am finished, I have all the various measured attachments to go over the ears, over the sideburns, up the back from neck to contour of head at the back, and trim over the ears and at the front hairline with the scissors.  More important than the cost savings, I am getting a haircut done to myself in front of a mirror that satisfies my wife who wants me to just look decent.</li>
    <li> I am happy for the price I paid and it gets the job done. It is not very good for a close shave, but great with attachments.</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for an old haircut machine. Love the fact it&#x27;s cordless. Good value for the price. Works well, needs charging every 2-3 haircuts.</li>
    <li> My son wanted to save money on haircuts, so I bought this for him to use, he loves the multiple number of gauges so that he can cut sides and top different lengths.</li>
    <li> Conair 22 piece cord/cordless Haircut Kit comes with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-A hard plastic storage case that makes storage neat and tidy.&lt;br /&gt;-An instruction manual that comes in English and Spanish.  In the manual you find the instructions and maintenance instructions but also a kit replacement parts and accessories order form and hair cutting tips.&lt;br /&gt;-Two combs with two comb widths each; therefore, four different widths&lt;br /&gt;-One hair clip&lt;br /&gt;-Lubricating oil and mini cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;-One pair of hair trimming scissors&lt;br /&gt;-Conair hair clipper that comes with batteries, has an on/off switch, and an adjustable taper lever. The blades are made of high carbon stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;-Power cord for the hair clipper. It is 2 prong and would not take up more than one outlet&lt;br /&gt;-Guard for Conair hair clipper&lt;br /&gt;-Hair trimming guards #1-#8, AND a right and left ear guard. Each guard is labeled.&lt;br /&gt;-A cape with ties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this Conair clipper, and just about everything to test it, and it works great.  At the time I bought this device there was a coupon through Amazon Deals, so you might want to check for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To register your product you can go to [...].  This is good to do so the company can send you recall information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The Conair clipper is rechargeable, which is great if you want to trim hair outside or away from an outlet-you don&#x27;t have to worry about outlets and cords. There is a red light on the clipper to indicate that the device is charging.&lt;br /&gt;-The clipper device is lightweight, does not vibrate too much, and is curved for a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;-Limited five year warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The cape, unfortunately, is like a garbage bag with ties... and it does not cover the entire body (it looks like the front of a t-shirt).  The ties only fit snug around an adult&#x27;s neck, not a child&#x27;s.  My tip to cover a child&#x27;s neck: use the clip in the kit to keep it closed.&lt;br /&gt;-This kit does not come with a neck brush, which if it did, it would be a perfect 5-star kit.</li>
    <li> clearly the item title says 22 pieces, but I only received 19 pieces with 1 hair clip, 1 neck brush, and one comb missing. Although the missing pieces won&#x27;t affect my use of the clipper, it&#x27;s still not a good purchasing experience.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, and trims my hair really well.</li>
    <li> I had something happen in December that all my hair was cut off (I am a 59 year old woman). I have found out how nice it is to not have to mess with combs, brushes, curling irons, blow dryers, and every thing else that goes with having hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to keep my hair short. To do so, I knew I would need something to trim it myself. What reviews I read about this one made me choose it. I used it the other day and I am really happy with it. Very easy to use. I especially like being able to use it cordless. I am still learning which comb attachment to use for the exact length of hair I am wanting, but that is ok. I imagine I will have it figured out in one or two more trims. (want it about half an inch long or maybe just a tiny bit longer)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, for what you pay don&#x27;t expect superior product performance for that money.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and smooth. Works much better than our previous tool which my six year old son hates. For this one my son loves it.</li>
    <li> Charged it for 16 hours per instructions. Used it the next day with no problems.  I sell a lot of rechargeable items at the auto parts store I work at and if the customers would follow instructions it would save us both a lot of headaches. When instructions state charge for a specific time before using then do it don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> No good. Battery is weak and died after 3 uses. Made me sad, I really wanted this to work. Super cheap as reflected in the price.</li>
    <li> Works great so far. I like that it is cordless because we like to use them outside so we don&#x27;t have to sweep up hair off the floor.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very impressed and does a good job my husband cuts his on hair</li>
    <li> Works pretty good for being a cordless...has great variety in sizes of guards.  Sure will save money rather than going to the barbers for buzz cuts!</li>
    <li> I bought this to give myself a new hairstyle, and I have to say, it works great! I&#x27;ve used it both plugged in and not, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any power difference between them. The first time I opened it, I plugged it in and started using it right away (I have no patience for the 16 hour charging time the instructions say it should have before use!) and it worked fine. I&#x27;d recommend buying an additional bib/robe thing, because the one that comes with doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the hair bits off your neck. Otherwise, A+!</li>
    <li> This trimmer does not trim the neck and sideburns, as close as the Conair it replaced.</li>
    <li> After about a year of use (a hair cut roughly every 3 weeks so about 18 uses), this hair clipper has been lost its touch. The battery has not kept its charging capacity nor is its power output to an acceptable level. By the sound of it buzzing when it is plugged in, the clippers perform at about half the power when cordless at &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; charge. The charge diminishes extremely fast, plummeting to a barely usable device after about 5 minutes of use. Other than this aging battery problem, the clippers perform well when plugged. Definitely won&#x27;t be getting this one in the future.</li>
    <li> On time for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Great.  Exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband to use for his own personal trimming and for keeping my son&#x27;s hair fine trimmed as well. It charges quickly and can also be used with the power cord during charging. Excellent accessory kit</li>
    <li> First of all, this is my first haircut ever, I receive mine a few weeks back but it was until today I use it, and it does a pretty good job cutting my little boy hair, I only give four stars because the neck brush is missing, even if you look very close with the zoom, you can only count 21 pieces and the neck brush is not in the accesories picture. I hope that if you buy one you have the complete 22 pc.</li>
    <li> All i need is buzz cuts, all the extras are fine.  It works, and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> Bought this at wal-mart, but i can assure you, its the exact P.O.S. model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the get-go, pieces were already missing.  But since i don&#x27;t use those comb sizes use,  I bothered to return it.  The charge only lasts for a few minutes then its back to plugging it to the wall, essentially making it a wired hair cutter.  The motor is weak and chokes a lot even when plugged directly to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve gone out of my way to write a review about a product that I did not buy from Amazon, but I feel like I must alert people to not buy it.  Mines just gave up on me after one year of light use (mostly trimming my already short hair), and now im gonna go with the Wahl.  Its cheaper and has a higher rating and much better review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Comprehensive package. Full hair cutting kit, including appron, scissors, electronic clipper, cleaner &amp; lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Battery is probably not powerful - even after 18 hours of charging (recommended in manual), motor speed decreased significantly within 10 minutes. Works fine when the electric chord is connected however.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cleaning the equipment of hair is not easy, since it is not waterproof. However, I did hold it carefully below the facet and it didn&#x27;t cause any issues. (While the electric chord was connected. What can I say - I live dangerously!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, liked it.</li>
    <li> It is a really good product with a fair price.</li>
    <li> After two purchases of other clippers, I found what I wanted.  The attachments are stronger, charges easily and does a superb job.  Good price for a quality product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t run a salon so I can&#x27;t talk about it&#x27;s longevity. For now, it works fine. The cordless feature is nice and a charge indicator would be a good addition. 5 stars for now.</li>
    <li> Very strong device not poorly made.. for the prices this thing is a steal! !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I need</li>
    <li> what I expected, it meets all technical requirements which offered excellent performance for its price, I recommend this productproduct 5 stars AJMG</li>
    <li> Perfect for at-home haircutting.  Highly portable; once you go cordless, you&#x27;ll never want to use a corded shaver again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with all the typical accessories, scissors, comb, attachments and oil.</li>
    <li> Faboo,! No cord, works GREAT I use it every week.</li>
    <li> It worked okay for the few uses that I got out of it, but after about three months of use it just stopped holding a charge and will only turn on for about two seconds at a time. I have tried the original charger it came with, as well as two other compatible chargers, but the device is just dead. I am going to buy a higher end one this time.</li>
    <li> best home hair cut kit on the market</li>
    <li> Great and complete package for an excellent price.</li>
    <li> It works as expected. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Its primarily used for cutting my son&#x27;s hair, who is 3.</li>
    <li> I love it, this Product met all my expectations. And everyday more and more new items are in the web. thank you</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Bought this product as a replacement for a set of Conair cordless clippers that I used for 9 years - they finally died. I wear a high/tight and cut my own hair at least once a week. These clippers are a bit different than the older version: they are louder but also more powerful and seem to hold a charge much better. They are very sharp and cut very close at the lowest blade setting. I absolutely recommend these for anyone who wears a military style cut, especially if you do it yourself.</li>
    <li> very decent for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Item arrived defected</li>
    <li> About 20 years ago I bought a Conair clipper set from Sam&#x27;s wholesale club, they were very nice, in a metal case.  When the battery finally gave out I rushed to buy another Conair clipper set hoping for the same quality.  This one looked pretty much like my old one, but looks were about it.  Where my old batteries held a charge for months at a time, these just don&#x27;t.  I have to charge them before each use and am lucky to make it through one 10 minute haircut before I have to plug them in again.  Also, these pull our hair miserably, especially if the batteries are anything but full speed.  I oil and clean my clippers regularly as instructed and take them apart and clean them but still, just not near the quality of the old ones.</li>
    <li> The battery on it is horrible and can only be used plugged in.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this purchase. The price was right here, but I am disappointed with the performance. We had a Conair kit very similar to this before and it lasted for years, was quiet and only pulled at hair toward the end. This one is SO LOUD right out of the box, which I don&#x27;t like, and worse is that it is already starting to pull at hair when we use it even though I have used the oil/lube included. The loudness might get better... but I&#x27;m not sure if the pulling will. I am already thinking about whether this was cheap enough to just throw out and buy another one.</li>
    <li> it seems to be a fine item---we have had one before, however we liked the case for the first one much better.</li>
    <li> I use these cutters to trim my two yr olds hair and they work fine i do wish that someone would make a 2 inch guard for clippers though cause i think he looks cuter with a bit longer hair but these are good an hold a charge well i have not had to recharge them yet and i have used them 10x. So after owning these for a while they cut less and less smothly and have started to pull my little ones hair. I have since bought another brand of clippers because these just dont last.</li>
    <li> they broke during my second haircut. It was a good thing I didn&#x27;t toss my old ones. I recommend you pay the extra money and get some higher quality clippers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the price. Nothing really bad about it</li>
    <li> This is a good clipper. I like being able to use it in the shower (no water running) so the hair can just be rinsed down the drain. The attachments and adjustable blade settings allow for a lot of different lengths that allow for me to clip both my hair and my beard. The charge lasts pretty long, enough for a few day&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these clippers that I have bought. The last one worked great for about six years, but one of the hair guides broke. I went online to find more hair guides but found a whole new clipper set for less than $20. Seeing as a cheap haircut is $15 these days, I bought it. It looked exactly like the one I had already but when I got it I noticed it had no &#x27;power burst&#x27; button on the side which I used a lot to get through my thick hair. Turns out, this clipper doesn&#x27;t need that button! Cuts great! Saves me $$$ and more importantly to me, I can cut my hair how I like, when I like with no waiting around. Love this thing!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Now i will never have to take my husband to the barber again!!!:-)</li>
    <li> Great price so far so good!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I got a defective one, but this thing has no power plugged in or on battery charge. It &amp;#34;does the job&amp;#34; but hardly what I would have expected from the reviews.  Conair is a good company so I suspect it was just bad luck on my set.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, works great.</li>
    <li> Great unit. Great value.</li>
    <li> Product was great for its price and function, yet it dies on me only 3 months after occasional use (I use it pretty much once every 3-4 weeks). What a shame.</li>
    <li> Item received and worked good</li>
    <li> Main complaint is the charging light never turns off to let you know if its fully charged, but it being cordless is a great advantage.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for home hair cuts for any age.  Combs for several lengths and a plastic cape.  For short hair cuts, save the hassle and expense of trips to the barber or beauty shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend also buying the Scalpmaster Stand-up Neck Duster to clear away the clipping remnants from the neck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> Cuts smoothly and holds a charge. Does everything we hoped for. We use it on my husband and toddler. So glad we bought it! Much better than the others we have tried.</li>
    <li> I used these for the first time yesterday and they seem to be very good for the price. These are much cheaper than other clippers. The cordless part is a nice touch. It did however take 12-16 hours to charge. I did notice that it missed a few pieces of hair but you get what you pay for and this is to be expected with a cheap pair of choppers.  Update: I have had these for over a month and have used them numerous times. They work very well and I get about 10 shaves out of a single charge. They cut very well for cheap clippers. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a cheap, wireless solution for home clippers.</li>
    <li> good for trimming, but not for cutting, they could be better, but for the price not bad</li>
    <li> The first one I received didn&#x27;t even charge. The red light never went on. I exchanged it for a replacement, and made sure to follow the instructions and charge the second one for 16 hours before use. It worked at first and died after 20 minutes. I thought it was just a short battery life, so I recharged it for another 16 hours. Much to my surprise, it was dead. This is a case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34; Stay away.</li>
    <li> The clip constantly falls off and the blades will cut you.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price from a trusted brand</li>
    <li> Good clipper.  difficult to beat amazon price for this product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I had a Conair Cordless Clippers for about 10 years it was great, finally it died so I thought I would stick with the same manufacture so I bought this one, I am a little disappointed with the quality its noisy I mean much noisier than the old one it does not hold the charge like the old one , for about $20.00 its cheap but I would not recommend it for anyone who cut his own hair which I&#x27;ve been doing for the last 15 years,  next time I would do more research maybe  spend a little more and get a good one, too bad Conair new technology should be better than old one, other whys, what&#x27;s the point&lt;br /&gt;More bad news it just died its still under warranty so I will contact Conair soon and I will update</li>
    <li> Easy to use and great for trimming my hair now that I&#x27;m cutting my own hair.  The actual thing that sold this tool to me was a video and testimonial from a guy that had no arms and used his feet to operate this tool to cut his hair.  I figured if he could do that without arms, and considering how clumsy I am, this was the hair trimmer for me.  I have not been disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Works great and the rechargeable battery with a stand that allows hands free use is a major convenience.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I was tired of shelling out $15 for a haircut when I&#x27;m mostly bald, and the last two barbers I had both did a terrible job.  I knew I could probably do a better job myself so looked on Amazon for a haircutting kit.  Found this on sale and have since cut my hair a few times with it.  I&#x27;m able to cut it well enough to not be too embarrassed with the way it looks afterwards, but I know there has to be a better clipper out there.  For the price it&#x27;s hard to complain too much though.  Part of the problem is my lack of coordination using it, however the clipper just doesn&#x27;t cut close enough even when I&#x27;m using the shortest comb that&#x27;s provided.  Seems I should easily be able to clip the sides better.  Takes me a long time to cut my hair even though it&#x27;s fairly short and I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair left, up to one and a half hours.  For me it has held a charge well (I charge it at least 12 hours before using, and sometimes longer).  If you are just looking for something cheap to use for now until you can afford a more expensive one, this might fill your needs.  Just don&#x27;t expect to look like a movie star after you cut your hair.  I certainly don&#x27;t.  Might also want to watch videos online to see how to cut your hair properly.</li>
    <li> Need to keep it plugged while using it! Fully charged battery lasts less than a minute</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the negative reviews.  Does not have the power to shaver a beard.  Feels like it is yanking out the whiskers.</li>
    <li> Wonderful handy clippers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair to save money on barbershop visits. I currently have a Wahl razor but it seems to be wearing out. I definitely love the smooth feel when shaving my hair when it comes to this product!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and everything looks great! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The battery doesnt last very long and they get dull pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> The clipper charges quickly, and runs for a long time on one charge.  It works smoothly, and the adjustable head works just as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> This works but I could not figure out how to use all those different &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; attachments, didn&#x27;t know what each of them did and could find no documentation in the kit to guide me.  I was shaving the knots off my cat so keep that in mind.  The shaver worked best when it was still cold; once you&#x27;d been using it for a few minutes and the thing started getting too warm to the touch, it stopped cutting well and I had to turn it off, let it cool off and try again later--which made for a very long week of shaving little patches of fur off every day instead of just doing it in one fast swipe.</li>
    <li> Very happy works good very smooth cuts hair good</li>
    <li> It came already charged.  I used it straight from the box.  It works great for home hair cuts.  The original charge lasted about 15 minutes.  I havene&#x27;t used it again to see what a full charge would be.  It cut great and was quiet.</li>
</ol>
