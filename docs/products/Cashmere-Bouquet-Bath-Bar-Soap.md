      <li>and I was glad it is still available online.</li>
      <li>which is the first place I go for most online shopping, and THERE IT WAS!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still available at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Every year it&#x27;s available in fewer retail outlets.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something traditional and this was great.</li>
      <li>I loved Cashmere Bouquet powder as a young girl, so when I saw the soap I just had to get it...</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>My husband loves the scent which is clean, not overly perfumey, and still smells feminine.</li>
      <li>It cleans without drying your skin, it rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t decide whether to use it now or for an special occasion?</li>
      <li>Soft means a nice, luxurious lather that you don&#x27;t have to fitght with your bar soap to get.</li>
      <li>I am so glad to find something inexpensive that I really like.</li>
      <li>One day she told me how much she loved this soap when she was younger and was very excited when I gave this to her.</li>
      <li>I did a quick search on Amazon.....</li>
      <li>The scent is mild but leaves a lingering scent on your skin.</li>
      <li>Creamy, cleansing and classic!!!</li>
      <li>(smile).</li>
      <li>Cashmere Bouquet leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, and clean.</li>
      <li>However, if you are sensitive to strong fragrances this may not be the soap for you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this soap for the first time today and the lather is luscious.</li>
      <li>It will leave your skin soft and sweet.  </li>
      <li>Where have you been?&lt;br /&gt; Being in my early thirties makes me so jealous of all the fortunate women that are older than I, who were blessed to experience the &amp;#34;finer&amp;#34; things in life.</li>
      <li>The scent may be a little strong for some users, but I find it to be just fine.</li>
      <li>It has a strong chemical smell which is not a fresh or clean scent and unlike any soap I have smelled.</li>
      <li>only issue is that I find the perfume too strong.  </li>
      <li>I strongly suggest to anyone who would like to smell something historic.</li>
      <li>The cleansing is gentle yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Lifelong favorite.</li>
      <li>It cleans well, last a long time, and it&#x27;s gentler than most supermarket soaps (which are closer to synthetic detergents than to &#x27;true&#x27; soaps).  </li>
      <li>have used it for many years especially after diving or surfing and it really helps to get my skin back to a point</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert</li>
      <li>This is a classic soap formula made the old fashion way.  </li>
      <li>And old old soap my 93 year old mother likes.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not 100% natural</li>
      <li>I like it because it is bar soap, but it&#x27;s soft just like the hotel soap you use and wonder why you can&#x27;t get it for your home.</li>
      <li>but once I&#x27;ve used it it really helped my bad acne and made me smell good.</li>
      <li>One day my Mom asked me if I remembered about Cashmere Bouquet and I quickly ordered her a few bars.  </li>
      <li>It does NOT small the same.  </li>
      <li>so it is hard to find a decent soap: they are too drying, they don&#x27;t clean well enough, or I don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
      <li>good soap little expensive but decent size ,does what it says will not dry for normal skin</li>
      <li>hard to get excited about Soap</li>
      <li>It will not dry or irritate your skin like detergent bacterial soaps such as Irish Spring, Dial or others of that category.  </li>

<li> states &amp;#34;We&#x27;ve been lured into a chemical-weapons war on bacteria, when plain soap is usually fine.&amp;#34;  Cashmere Bouquet is an original soap made since 1874 with lye and tallow, the traditional ingredients in soap.</li>
<li> After a long driving trip, we stopped into a hotel and were headed for our room.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
<li> It had a harsh fragrance like old perfume.</li>

<li> but it has been a huge disappointment.</li>

<li> Sadly, according to Colgate-Palmolive, it is under LIMITED PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION.  </li>
<li> This soap is hard to find arpund here</li>
<li> (it&#x27;s hard to find anywhere else)</li>
<li> My late grandmother used this soap.</li>
<li> at least will but again</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loved Cashmere Bouquet powder as a young girl, so when I saw the soap I just had to get it...I was not disappointed.  It was delivered on time, but I always get my stuff on time from Amazon.</li>
    <li> No scent detected and I initially confused this soap with the old fashioned Sweetheart soap used to make grade school, mesh covered fish-looking, gifts for our Mothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now also remember Cashmere Bouquet&#x27;s talc and thought this soap should have that same scent but no scent is detected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cashmere Bouquet Bath Bar Soap leaves behind soap scum; I do not like it.</li>
    <li> What can I say about Cashmere Bouquet ? It has been around for ages and it works and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for many years especially after diving or surfing and it really helps to get my skin back to a point my girl friend likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is getting harder to find and I was thrilled to see it on Amazon. I ordered a bunch and I will order more. Hey the powder is nice too.</li>
    <li> Cashmere Bouquet is a soap I grew up with and had used for almost 30 years. It went scarce about 10 years ago and I didn&#x27;t know why. When I went looking in other areas for it I had seen it in one store until they changed hands then the soap disappeared again. I recently found out it was discontinued by Colegate Palmolive. Cashmere Bouquet leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, and clean. The scent is mild but leaves a lingering scent on your skin. I never had acne growing up and I attribute that to this soap. I wish Colegate Palmolive would reconsider and start making the soap again. After all it had been on the market for 114 years...at least.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why this isn&#x27;t the Number One soap sold today. Every year it&#x27;s available in fewer retail outlets. I like it because it is bar soap, but it&#x27;s soft just like the hotel soap you use and wonder why you can&#x27;t get it for your home. Soft means a nice, luxurious lather that you don&#x27;t have to fitght with your bar soap to get. Yes, it means the bar will be used up faster but it&#x27;s not an expensive soap so that&#x27;s not a valid issue with me. If you&#x27;ve never tried it, I recommend just trying it once.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance of this soap.....reminds me of my honeymoon.  After a long driving trip, we stopped into a hotel and were headed for our room.&lt;br /&gt;While in the elevator there was a family that must of all just showered and the smell was so refreshing and clean...been using it every since!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She said the scent is really pleasant. Loves it</li>
    <li> We love this soap and do not understand why the grocery stores no longer carry it. The scent is perfect and it suds great.</li>
    <li> The FDA has put bar &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; manufacturers on notice that they must prove the effectiveness of the &amp;#34;anti-bacterial soaps,&amp;#34; which likely make false claims about their product&#x27;s effectiveness and safety.  A recent article (Joanna Weiss, Boston Globe DEC 2013) states &amp;#34;We&#x27;ve been lured into a chemical-weapons war on bacteria, when plain soap is usually fine.&amp;#34;  Cashmere Bouquet is an original soap made since 1874 with lye and tallow, the traditional ingredients in soap. It will not dry or irritate your skin like detergent bacterial soaps such as Irish Spring, Dial or others of that category.  Cashmere Bouquet is mild, effective, and pleasantly fragrant.  It will leave your skin soft and sweet.  That&#x27;s why our grandma&#x27;s all had it in their houses!  Sadly, according to Colgate-Palmolive, it is under LIMITED PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION.  Big Lots Stores no longer carry it.  You&#x27;ll never find it in a drug store.  Walgreens sells it online only.  And of course, YOU CAN STILL GET IT ON AMAZON!  Stock up!  My suspicion is that Colgate-Palmolive will slowly and quietly discontinue this product with no announcement.  Once it is gone, it will be sorely missed, just like our grandmas...</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this for a neighbor and she is thrilled!  We were sitting on the patio discussing products that are not available now.....ones that we really liked.  She mentioned Cashmere Bouquet among others.  I did a quick search on Amazon.....which is the first place I go for most online shopping, and THERE IT WAS!  Soap.....hard to get excited about Soap....but my neighbor was so happy to see the familiar product again. I didn&#x27;t use it &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34; as I had other favorites but she says the fragrance is the same. (smile).</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have, the &amp;#34;flower bouquet&amp;#34; that snells so good in a bath room, that , I, remember, in my &amp;#34;mom&#x27;s&amp;#34; bath room. Smells, ok.</li>
    <li> This soap is hard to find arpund here and I was glad it is still available online. It is a must for the wife!!</li>
    <li> And old old soap my 93 year old mother likes.  I was so glad to find it online and got her some for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> This soap has a mild, nice scent. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry  the skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I used to get it in stores but it disappeared from the shelves. I had searched for it everywhere!  I was delighted to find it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Mom requested this soap as she used it when she was growing up and doesn&#x27;t like any soap made today.  At 92 I figured I would find her some and now she is happy with dozens of bars.</li>
    <li> I never tried Cashmere Bouquet before but once I&#x27;ve used it it really helped my bad acne and made me smell good.I had to wait for the soap for another day, but no big deal.This soap was one of the popular brands in the Philippines from here, I had read in the newspaper.I should of got it myself at the 99¢ store though that my mom had told me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom&#x27;s birthday back in March. One day she told me how much she loved this soap when she was younger and was very excited when I gave this to her. (it&#x27;s hard to find anywhere else) She still loves this soap, and has been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a classic soap formula made the old fashion way.  It cleans well, last a long time, and it&#x27;s gentler than most supermarket soaps (which are closer to synthetic detergents than to &#x27;true&#x27; soaps).  It does contain a few chemical additives so it&#x27;s not 100% natural but it is one of the best soaps you will find at that price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that I find the perfume too strong.  Didn&#x27;t deduct any stars for the perfume because many people do like it.  However, if you are sensitive to strong fragrances this may not be the soap for you.</li>
    <li> Ordered the soap, the soap arrived on time, and the product remains my tried-and-true friend.  Love, love, love the fragrance - and gives me no migraines.</li>
    <li> The scent reminds you of an era gone by. My late grandmother used this soap. Can&#x27;t decide whether to use it now or for an special occasion?</li>
    <li> I bought this soap at the 99 Cent Only Store (two 4 oz bars for 99 cents).  I am so happy with it.  I was using Tone Soap, but this soap is cheaper, cleans better, and is gentler on my skin. I live in the desert so it is hard to find a decent soap: they are too drying, they don&#x27;t clean well enough, or I don&#x27;t like the smell.  My husband loves the scent which is clean, not overly perfumey, and still smells feminine. I am so glad to find something inexpensive that I really like.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best most inexpensive soaps I have tried. The fragrance is nice and like and it does not try out your skin</li>
    <li> One day my Mom asked me if I remembered about Cashmere Bouquet and I quickly ordered her a few bars.  She is happy to be reunited with an old scent and friend of hers from day&#x27;s gone by and its still making memories today as well.</li>
    <li> Creamy, cleansing and classic!!! Where have you been?&lt;br /&gt; Being in my early thirties makes me so jealous of all the fortunate women that are older than I, who were blessed to experience the &amp;#34;finer&amp;#34; things in life. Perfumes, soaps, bras, and much more. Products that are very simple yet essential for us women. Products that make us feel and look good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this soap for the first time today and the lather is luscious. The scent is classic, not what I&#x27;m used to, but wonderful. The cleansing is gentle yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked. I&#x27;ll be buying much more of this soap from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ladies for commenting on this soap because it is your reviews that made me make the purchase! I hope my review does the same to all the younger generations.</li>
    <li> The soap I received smells nothing like Cashmere Bouquet. The company has either changed the formula or I received an imitation of the brand name. It has a strong chemical smell which is not a fresh or clean scent and unlike any soap I have smelled. It really has a terrible scent.</li>
    <li> Cashmere Bouquet talcum powder is Fantastic, instead of deodorant.... and the soap is good too  !</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something traditional and this was great. I strongly suggest to anyone who would like to smell something historic.</li>
    <li> good soap little expensive but decent size ,does what it says will not dry for normal skin at least will but again</li>
    <li> I bought this because I can remember both of my Grandmothers using it. Smelling it takes me back in time.</li>
    <li> So disappointed, the soaps seems very old and the smell that I was looking for is faded!!  I use it to refresh the smell in my linen closet for towels and sheets:-(</li>
    <li> This is bath soap that doesn&#x27;t try to be anything else. The scent may be a little strong for some users, but I find it to be just fine. It cleans without drying your skin, it rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Just a good bath soap. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Our family used this soap all of my childhood and ice misses it.  I was so glad to find it but it has been a huge disappointment. It does NOT small the same.  It had a harsh fragrance like old perfume. I threw it out it smells do bad.  Too bad.. if they had made the same soap instead of said they did but NOT, I would have bought it forever.  I really hate to be treated like a fool.</li>
    <li> Lifelong favorite. Glad it&#x27;s still available at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the hotel I work at to try to keep the deer away from selected areas. It works quite well and not as expensive as other commercial animal repellants.</li>
