      <li>It does help with the fly-a-ways but doesn&#x27;t rub on easily.</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, not gooey and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>my absolute favorite!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am a man and use this product daily to keep stray bangs off of my forehead and more neatly styled. The best part about this wax is you can the strong hold without getting your hands sticky, and this one stick will last for years.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market, no flaking, last all day, stays in while in water yet washes out with regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stick lasts me 11 months. Its like a push pop but for your hair. Wax works so much better than gel and you can even use it on your dry hair. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; so I always used this for 8 years.</li>
    <li> I started using the Bed Head stick because my hair dresser raved about it and I love it! It does a great job of taming fly-aways without weighing your hair down with grease. It also lasts FOREVER. I think the last stick I had lasted me about 2 years. Be careful not to use too much. I just run it down one palm, rub my hands together, and then pat my head where the flyaways are.</li>
    <li> Good quality but sometimes hard to control how much to use.</li>
    <li> Love it. Love that I do not have to wash my hands when I&#x27;m done brushing my hair</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with longer thick curly hair...</li>
    <li> Been buying this for nearly a decade.  It is the best wax stick for spiking your hair.  Last all day, and does not get messed up when your hair gets wet, if you get caught in the rain.  This is the wax stick for all you Jersey Shore wanna bees.</li>
    <li> easy to use. lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I think this is a really great product.  It holds the style all day and night, until I change the style or wash my hair.  The stick form factor is far less messy than gels, tubes, and pumps.  You can use the stick to apply and style at the same time, often not having to touch your hair or product.</li>
    <li> I always style my hair while it&#x27;s wet, and I find it really hard to apply this whole my hair is wet, and if I do I apply on my hand then spread some on my hair, it&#x27;s just too sticky and messy and makes my hair unstyleable!! I tried it while my hair is dry, it looked great at first then it seemed greasy and hard and I had to wash my hair like 5 times to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> This product works super duper well on my hair. Love it!!</li>
    <li> The shapping effect is good . Just a little too shiny .</li>
    <li> Great product for hair. Fast delivery and product is good to go. My hair guy taught me how to use it right, so i&#x27;m happy.  It lets your hair keep it&#x27;s style even when it gets wet. Almost like a wax coating of your hair.</li>
    <li> Great price great product</li>
    <li> This is the best hair wax on the market hands down!  It has a great smell that I love, and when I spike my hair, it stays the exact way all day long.  Fantastic product!  my absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> Perfect for edges! Great for short hair, fly aways or blending with weave. It also last forver. I would give it 5 star but if overused it can feel heavy/greasy on hair.</li>
    <li> Have always enjoyed this product.  Great wax for short military type cuts to keep in place and give it that polished and professional look.</li>
    <li> I never let my hair get too long and this works extremely well in that scenario.  It is not stiff or brittle and holds very well.  I have been buying this for longer than I care to admit and paying twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No brittle feel&lt;br /&gt;Holds for as long as you leave it in your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It has a beeswax feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beesway feel I mentioned does not bother me in the least and it&#x27;s better than what you would get from a lot of products.  That, combined with the long term hold makes it the only product of its kind I will use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to find this at the salons reminds me of the scene in O Brother Where Art Though where Clooney looks and looks for his favorite hair product.  Romantic notions asside, I enjoy having this come in the mail, ship free and at half the price.</li>
    <li> The Tigi Bed Head Hair Stick at 2.7 Ounce is a real bargain, period! I use it on my mustache!</li>
    <li> Could not function without this stick...just brilliant concept and very practical..lasts a long time. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it either</li>
    <li> Great!  Shipped fast.  Totally happy.</li>
    <li> The only hair product I use!</li>
    <li> If you use or have used this product you can save a lot of $$$ buying it online. It is a little too sticky for me but if you already like it is is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and was glad when I found it online for a cheaper price, this product compared to others will not leave flakes which looks like dandruff.</li>
    <li> No need to reapply daily. Just wet your head and style and you&#x27;re done! My favorite product to style my hair</li>
    <li> Fabulous service. Quick shipping. Great deal. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. My husband uses it in his hair as well as his beard to control unruly and out of place hairs. The product itself (in container) lasts a very long time. The biggest plus is that it is a stick - you are not dipping your fingers into a container; just rub it on your finger tips and apply where needed.</li>
    <li> Brilliant little invention. You can style your hair on the go and it holds all day - perfect little gym-bag or briefcase buddy.</li>
    <li> Tigi Bed head keeps your hair smooth.  I was leery but overall happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> good service and product</li>
    <li> Recommended for a very trashy &amp;#34;just got out of bed&amp;#34; Style.&lt;br /&gt;Try it and see if it works for your hair kind!</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. My barber turned me onto it. Now that I no longer live in MD, I have to order it online. Shipping was pretty quick. The price was ok. Being that I love the stuff, I&#x27;d pay a little extra.</li>
    <li> I go to this styling stick for my short hair and mycurls are always perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this TIGI item for years I  AM VERY SATISFIED WITH PRODUCT . I highly recommend BEAD HEAD.</li>
    <li> I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> This stick last forever, and easy to control! It&#x27;s good to bring it with u to the office, use whenever you want.</li>
    <li> The BEST product for my flyways.  I&#x27;m an actress, so I&#x27;m constantly needing something for my unruly flyways.  The make-up artist on set recommended this after she bought it specifically for my character.  And I love it.  It&#x27;s not too greasy and I don&#x27;t need to use my hands to apply.  Just take off the top and use it like a stick of deodorant right on my hair.  It keeps my hair in place!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wax and holds my stiff Asian hair. Good enough and excellent if you have stiff straight hair. Just don&#x27;t use too much then your hair gets too stiff.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  I hate putting &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in my hair, however, just like the front of my hair to stand up a little.  This stick is perfect.  I just apply it to my hair right after getting out of the shower.  None of it ever touches my scalp (which is what I hate) and it holds for the entire day.  Perfect !!</li>
    <li> Hair spray dries out my hair, but this holds it without drying it out.  It doesn&#x27;t build up either. Try it, you may be surprised,.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, just push up the stick and rub it on your hair.  It works great and you don&#x27;t end up with messy hands.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Leaves  residue kind of sticky</li>
    <li> Great Hair stick expensive but great product</li>
    <li> The best hair product out there for someone with thick hair like me...Love it!</li>
    <li> Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. it was $13 and some change thru amazon, I can only find it in specialty salons around town and its always $19.99 I think 9.99 would be a good price but I will continue to buy it regardless because it is a great quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I love how this stuff has a more natural hold and it just works with my coarse, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I would never use another product this is nice clean and last all day no grease hair no wet looking head</li>
    <li> The product arrived much faster than I expected. Will definitely order from this seller again. The product itself does what it says. it has good hold, not alot of shine, and is easy to apply.  The only downsides i could see is that if you apply too much it could look kinda bad but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> A little goes a very long way unless you want your hair to look greasy or messy. I don&#x27;t, I just use a wee bit on the part and to keep my bangs out of my face. Brings out nice reddish/chestnut highlights in brown hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dozen of products over the years, this is by far the best !! Great hold, and it makes my hair a little shiney! It offers a great hold, a lil shine, and doesnt make my hair all crusty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way -- one tube of this should last months! And washed out very very easily. If you are considering buying this -- just take the plunge. You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as it&#x27;s always been.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of stick, to keep my hair in place.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping my short sides sleek.</li>
    <li> Functions as expected.</li>
    <li> This product is very thick and weighed my hair down. I tried using it on my edges to tame my post relaxer growth on my temples and noticed that the product was difficult to put on and created a lot of build-up. For those looking for an edge control I would recommend Hicks instead.</li>
    <li> My husband wears his hair short and spikes it up with this stuff.  It works super well for this style and takes next to no skill or work.  He rubs it over the top of his head and he is good to go.</li>
    <li> Good as allways TIGI!! a bit pricy, but worthed. !!!!! Gives you the look the you love all day long!!!</li>
    <li> Because of my thick Asian hair I never really found a product that could both style my hair and maintain its hold for a whole day.  Some products would maybe work for an hour (gel) before giving out while others would last only for the time I am looking into the mirror fixing my hair (pomade).  Tigi Bed Head can do it both right and well beyond that.  It&#x27;s strong enough to style and hold my hair and beter yet keep it throughout the day.  Granted by the end of the day it does get weaker, it&#x27;s one of the best I have used.  The only downside is removing it from my hair.  Shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to remove it and the only thing I&#x27;ve found that can is a bar of soap, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s pretty damaging to my hair.  Overall I recommend this to all any Asian guy who has thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great product that I have been using for years. Great price here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Doesnt leave you with the hair helmet. Good for a dry look and keeps everything im its place. Finally it keeps its label on point with the phrase cool hair stick for cool people. I found out this is the case when I found it in my grandma&#x27;s bathroom cabinet. She&#x27;s damn cool.</li>
    <li> Great product for final shaping/molding. I use it conjunction with my regular product, to get a few difficult spots to do what I want. Is a bit to waxy (for me) to use as a primary hair product.</li>
    <li> wish this stuff was an add on item and was cheaper, but maybe i&#x27;m being too picky.</li>
    <li> SO i bought this stuff cause it smelt good,,,,and i use it often.....but if you have real dark hair,,,i dont suggest it cause your hair looks dusty like or like white residues. Stuff has a good hold,,but i dont suggest it cause it makes your hair looks pretty goofy....i have to go buy more hair product today actually because this one is not adequate,,,,go with something that has a more natural hold and glistening appearance,,not old man gray/dust.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  I have a very short hair cut...and If I can&#x27;t get to the beauty parlor every week, I can slick this on my edges and they won&#x27;t stick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on at night and put my scarf on.  When I wake, I take my scarf off and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about two months and I still have a lot left...so, you only have to use a little bit in order to get the desired effect. This is also a great price because this product is $18 in the beauty parlor.  It is $11 dollars on line.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Very strong hold.  Lasts a very long time.  Allows you to do whatever you want with your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. One tube will last literally for years .</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  it totally makes my hair &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; without making it stiff!  One drawback is that my hair gets stuck on the end of the wax stick, and the only way to get it off is to wipe with a tissue... sort of gross, but I can&#x27;t imagine any other way to deliver this product except the stick.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would slick and hold down my natural african-american (4ab) hair edges.  It required alot and it didn&#x27;t work.  Seems like there is too much oil in the product.  I was expecting a very hard wax substance. Also the smell is very overwhelming.  If you have allergies or if you are sensitive to odors, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday, best place to buy.  Very nice for any open Jeep riders :)  buy two last for a year.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but good stuff.  I&#x27;ve owned this product before but it is hard to find.  Delivery was fast even though I am overseas.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for taming unruly shorter hair; sets it in place.  Works well on longer hair too, but you probably want your long flowing locks to move a little more than this allows.  Also great for waking up the next day with some exceptional bed head.</li>
    <li> Best hair product EVER. No residue. No flakes. Very matte finish, give your hair a more natural look, instead of &amp;#34;wet, made an effort look&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for me and last so long.  This is the second one of these I have purchased.  The first one lasted several years.  Granted I don&#x27;t use it daily but I do use if often.</li>
    <li> This stuff is tried-and-true there is no substitution this stuff is great</li>
    <li> While this wax works great for me I find using rather inconvenient.  The wax can be pushed up from the bottom so that you can apply it to your hand or directly to the hair.  The problem is that it has to be pushed back down every time,  there is no room in the cap for it to stay out even a little bit.  is also moves back and forth rather easily.  I prefer a wax stick that you push out and use until it&#x27;s done,  like chapstick.  Less touching the wax,  less mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might not be a problem for some,  but it&#x27;s enough for me to try another brand.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy . Very pleased with the transaction and product. I recommend it to everyone .</li>
    <li> Never quite figured out how to use this product. Leaves clumps in my medium length hair. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This wax never is too oily and lasts for a really long time. Recommended if you don&#x27;t like the dry, crackly hair that hair spray or mousse gives you.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all. Not sure how to use it.  Was waxy, sticky mess in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have been using it for a decade and I like the non-greasy look and the fact that it holds all day.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive in my opinion-but it&#x27;s my hubby&#x27;s preferred brand!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a cream, pommade, or other product that does not completely dry in hair.  Love this product though as it is easy to use and stays flexible all day long (almost thickens hair).  Can really only be used for short hair and not great for &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; fixing.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It goes on easy. It controls wild hair like &amp;#34;cow licks&amp;#34;. One stick lasts me several months. The product is a wax so it doesn&#x27;t dry and flake like gels and sprays.</li>
    <li> I use this for the back of my son&#x27;s hair that needs to be tamed.  It works, but does leave a sticky feeling.  It also works well to spike up the front of his hair.</li>
    <li> just love the stick - sticky but not like others... looks natural and not like you have pound of glue in your hair</li>
    <li> Its perfect for my husband&#x27;s hair! And we usually can only find it on Amazon. Great Buy for any one</li>
    <li> Used it for years. I think my daughter loves it more, she can make my hair stand up like a troll doll.</li>
    <li> Using it for years and never disappointed</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product and I would recommend it to others who are trying to get their hair to lay down around the edges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10+ years and keep coming back for the excellent smell and hold.  You can&#x27;t beat this product - expensive but awesome.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair stick. It&#x27;s light, not gooey and easy to apply. And it is so much cheaper to buy online than in a retail store.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff ... It&#x27;s the only product that keeps my flat top up ... All day. Definitely would recommend this product for stubborn hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - it is quick and easy to apply consistently, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily OR rigid like a board. It gives a nice, natural look that you can style easily - a great middle ground between rock-hard hair gel, and greasy options that are out there.</li>
    <li> Provides good body and holds throughout the day. I just wish that the product wasn&#x27;t so expensive! Hair can get a little sticky towards end of the day.</li>
    <li> No longer can find this in stores. I bought it simply for the smell after asking a friend what it was their hair smelled like. Very versatile. I have fine long hair. I use it by rubbing onto my hands and smoothing away fly aways and keeping my curls in my ponty tail. Shorter hair can apply stright to hair from the stick. For absolutely every hair type. Get one!</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine, curly in some areas and straight in others. I like to do a straight, piecey look, and this wax is the only one that works for me. If a wax is even slightly wet, it makes my hair curl, defeating the whole purpose. This is the only wax I&#x27;ve found that isn&#x27;t wet. It&#x27;s like a big chapstick you rub on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I love about it is, not only does it hold well, but if my hair gets messed up in the wind or whatever, this wax makes it totally re-moldable. As opposed to say, spray or gel that make your hair hard, but if it gets messed up, you can&#x27;t fix it. This has good hold but if my hair gets out of place, I can just give it a pull here and a tug there, and voila, back the way I want it.</li>
    <li> If you want to make sure your hair stays in place and don&#x27;t mind a bit of wax this is your jam right here. This stick lasts for months and its great for travel as its small and not a liquid.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. I like to push my bangs back sometimes and this is the best for that! I also like it because it keeps my flyaways down. I put it down my part every day to keep away fly aways. It is also helpful to put on the ends of hair that won&#x27;t curl.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price!</li>
    <li> Works miracles on strAy hairs. A little goes a long way! Works great in between relaxers.Also great after work outs and shampoos.</li>
    <li> Excellent, affordable product for wayward hair!!!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for years to style his hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who dances and needs a tight bun with no fly-a-ways. It does help with the fly-a-ways but doesn&#x27;t rub on easily. I have to rub on my fingers and then on the hair opposed to just rubbing the stick on her hair. .</li>
    <li> i have used this product for years!  it is the best for my black coarse hair.  it makes it soft and gives it texture.  i have tried many other products and this is the only thing that works!</li>
    <li> I first started using TIGI Bed Head (Hair Stick for Cool People) many years ago.  I keep it at my photo studio to use on clients.  Its great for long hair (to tame frizzy&#x27;s) and for short hair (makes hair moldable while remaining movable).  Guys love this stuff.  They can style their hair easily and it doesn&#x27;t make hair hard like when using hair gel.</li>
    <li> Super handy. It&#x27;s like a glue stick for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue, is completely clear, and has damaged any of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because it helps fly aways, but only briefly.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever and is a miracle worker for holding hair in place. I have frizzy/curly hair and this product does wonders no matter how I style my hair. Must have.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve made it so long without this product! The price is right and it does wonders for my hair wet or dry. There is no sticky film and my edges look great. It&#x27;s also great for wraps.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great wax, nice gold, nice fragrance.  II usually just lightly move it along hairline where I want hair to be held. It&#x27;s a firm hold but it&#x27;s wax so a soft feel-not stiff like gels. If you have hair that is falling out easily--put it on hands and then gently work into hair. Isn&#x27;t rocket science. But a nice product</li>
    <li> I love the product!&lt;br /&gt;Product always ships pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buying in the near future.</li>
    <li> Imy hair dresser recommending this product. The first time she used this product on my daughters hair I was sold. She told me I could find it at my local drug store. I searched every drug store around me and couldn&#x27;t find it. I finally found it at a beauty supply store. However, the cost was too high according to my hair dresser. Found it here on Amazon and I was satisfied with the cost not to mention as a prime customer, I had free shipping. I will be purchasing it for amazon from here on out!</li>
    <li> I bought one for my husband and he immediately asked me to buy more. He loved the texture and the way it works on his hair</li>
    <li> Have used it for quite sometime, if your having a bad hair day this will do the job.</li>
    <li> Im not sure if this is different from the same one used in the salon but this stick here does NOT work at all!!! very disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It has great flexibility in styling capability and provides great hold while leaving your hair soft and movable, which means if I want to restyle on the go, just a sweep of my hands through the hair gives me a whole new look. The trick is using the right amount. Too much can just make your hair look greasy.</li>
