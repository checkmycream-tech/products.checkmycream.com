      <li>The taste is good and it seems to work about like most others.  </li>
      <li>I liked the advertisement of having a foaming toothpaste in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the foaminess as that makes me feel like it&#x27;s getting between the teeth better, which is good since I don&#x27;t like</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to be honest</li>
      <li>Very glad I did since it tastes much better than Sensodyne.</li>
      <li>The smartfoam glides across your teeth and they feel really, really clean!!</li>
      <li>and it is by far the best I have tried.  </li>
      <li>This is the perfect toothpaste for my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of overwhelming trying to decide what to buy.  </li>
      <li>Effective, with a pretty good flavor.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is easy on my teeth and it has a nice, refreshing taste.</li>
      <li>As for the 30% more foam claim, I cannot verify that as I have no way to measure.  </li>

      <li>I needed a toothpaste that was non-abrasive, helped the sensitivity, and would still taste ok.</li>
      <li>It makes you feel like there&#x27;s more cleaning going on</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s toothpaste that foams, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>The package claims to create 30% more foam.  </li>
      <li>so it really leaves you with a  fresh minty taste and feeling (especially welcome</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to review this for the vine program.  </li>
      <li>% more foam gets tough-to-reach places and helps keep teeth whiter&lt;br /&gt;*Builds</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a foaming version, and that has made all the difference in the world to me, and makes this product better than the others.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>My observations: my teeth do feel better after using this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Asterisk: 30% more than their non-foaming toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>Maybe the foam penetrates my teeth more and reaches areas that the sensodyne is not reaching.</li>
      <li>It helps my sensitivity just as well as the Sensodyne, but it&#x27;s quite a bit cheaper and it tastes better.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I have been using Sensodyne, but this Colgate toothpaste works just as well and tastes a bit better.</li>
      <li>Hope you enjoy!</li>
      <li>pleased with this, and will be getting more.</li>
      <li>and I really love it --</li>
      <li>This Colgate tastes a lot better than the Sensodyne.</li>
      <li>great toothpaste for sensitive teeth :)</li>
      <li>This made my teeth feel so clean!</li>
      <li>Colgate is a very good option, and I use it daily.</li>
      <li>There are not a lot of good sensitive toothpastes that also whiten, while still tasting good and leaving you with a fresh (not chalky) feeling in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps I have a strong memory of Mentadent or something.  </li>
      <li>Only toothpaste I use and it works...will keep your smile BRIGHT!  :-)</li>
      <li>A perfectly fine tooth paste.  </li>
      <li>For that purpose it&#x27;s purposely fine.</li>
      <li>No kidding this will have your mouth spilling out with light foam from this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>which is especially important to people who want to use a whitening agent daily without suffering pain.</li>
      <li>Good for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Plus, the foaming action seems to help disperse everything to ensure good tooth</li>
      <li>I loved using this toothpaste, it really leaves your mouth with a clean and fresh feeling.</li>
      <li>I use Colgate almost exclusively and was excited to see this one was foamy,</li>
      <li>As I age, I find that I am having more and more difficulty with sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>When it came time to buy more tooth paste, I got this simply because I liked the foaming and the taste.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel healthy and clean after a gentle brushing and</li>
      <li>/&gt;Insofar as taste goes, this one actually tastes really good, it has a lot bursts of minty flavor while you are brushing</li>
      <li>The mint is very fresh-tasting versus the more &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; taste of the Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Taste is mild not too over powering.</li>
      <li>It has a mild minty taste and doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach.</li>
      <li>The flavor is mild.</li>
      <li>Minty but somewhat mild.</li>
      <li>The foam gets into more sensitive areas and that is huge for me.  </li>
      <li>Basically a soft smooth paste that foams a bit more in your mouth...</li>
      <li>My first thought was that it taste good and left my teeth feeling clean</li>
      <li>This is our new favorite toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>As for taste it does not have much and I am fine with that also.  </li>
      <li>The taste is not as good as the Colgate gel flavors, but it is not a bad taste, either, and doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;baking soda&amp;#34; aftertaste that some other whitening toothpastes do.</li>
      <li>It is rare that a review product gets me to change brands</li>
      <li>It makes my sensitive teethes feel much better after using it.</li>
      <li>This one is well worth a look.</li>
      <li>It needs a touch of mint or wintergreen to make your mouth feel fresh.  </li>
      <li>It will say 30% more foaming action.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste&#x27;s bottom line for me was it wasn&#x27;t working as eliminating sensitivity, I therefore went back to Colgate Total with Whitening which I truly believe is the best all-around tooth paste solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>there are so many sensitive toothpastes now --</li>
      <li>However, the older I got, the more sensitive my teeth became and I switched to Crest because Colgate didn&#x27;t have a sensitive formula that I liked......</li>
      <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is my new favorite!</li>
      <li>I typically use their Sensitive whitening or enamel protect versions with very good results.  </li>
      <li>Love this item number one for the fact that it really does help with sensitive teeth and love the foaming action.</li>
      <li>I don’t know if this had anything to do with it, but I really didn’t notice “more” foam, as much as I noticed the very distinctive feel to it.</li>
      <li>The foam makes me more confident I am reaching all the tight spots and my gums.  </li>
      <li>The foam develops more like that of a fine foam, with softer feel to it than typical toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>first thing in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is more foam than with regular toothpastes I have used</li>
      <li>So it does really work!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s going to possibly foam more than any non-foaming</li>
      <li>regularly this would be a plausible solution.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this, I looked like a rabid dog.  </li>

    <li> It makes my sensitive teethes feel much better after using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste that foams, it&#x27;s okay.  The foam stays in your mouth....doesn&#x27;t over-foam.</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I use Colgate almost exclusively and was excited to see this one was foamy, well not too much foam involved. I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Plus when I opened the package there wasn&#x27;t a silver seal on the tube and there was some brown substance on the opening.  I used a clorox cleaning cloth &amp; wiped it off...I should have sent it back but that&#x27;s a hassle.</li>
    <li> There is so much foam with this toothpaste that I choke each morning.  I have cut the amount repeatedly, no difference..down to the size of smaller than a pea...still foaming.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This made my teeth feel so clean! I also loved the foam created!</li>
    <li> This is my go-to Tooth Paste.  I started getting sensitive teeth (at least in the back) and the dentist recommend Sensodyne.  That stuff was pricey so I tried this instead...and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are no longer sensitive (not sure what that was all about), and my last tube was just some random regular variety we had in the cabinet.  When it came time to buy more tooth paste, I got this simply because I liked the foaming and the taste.</li>
    <li> So easy to re-order online with other things! great toothpaste for sensitive teeth :)</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this toothpaste for about a month, and I certainly notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. It&#x27;s not bright as it is white, but there is a substantial difference.&lt;br /&gt;Since we&#x27;ve had the single tube for a month, I can say the content is pretty generous (then again, I squeeze every amount I can).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have noticed that in the past couple weeks my lower right gum has been aching. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s causal of this toothpaste, considering it happened only recently after having used this toothpaste for some time, but I&#x27;ll keep a mental note.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this, I looked like a rabid dog.  It tastes good and works well.  My teeth are sensitive to cold and I&#x27;ve noticed less sensitivity since using this product.</li>
    <li> Despite the unsettling term “smartfoam,” conjuring the image of toothpaste full of cleaning nanos, this product really does work.  Periodically, for unknown reasons, areas of my teeth become very sensitive near the gumline and it’s painful to brush them.  My dentist recommended that I use toothpaste for sensitive teeth when they are bothering me. I have been using Sensodyne, but this Colgate toothpaste works just as well and tastes a bit better.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is easy on my teeth and it has a nice, refreshing taste. I would definitely get it again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth, which have caused me nothing but issues since I was a kid. These issues have only gotten worse over the years, to the point of having to let hot foods become lukewarm, and the same for cold foods. I&#x27;ve been using toothpaste for sensitive teeth for some time, but just tend to get whichever one happens to be on sale. I&#x27;ve never tried a foaming version, and that has made all the difference in the world to me, and makes this product better than the others. The foam gets into more sensitive areas and that is huge for me.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> As I age, I find that I am having more and more difficulty with sensitive teeth.  My dentist recommended a very expensive toothpaste, but I decided I could probably find something a little more &amp;#34;cost-effective&amp;#34; that would do the trick.  I had tried several kinds before I had the opportunity to try Colgate&#x27;s version and it is by far the best I have tried.  Several of the others seemed to not be geared for teeth quiet as sensitive as my own, or they had an overwhelming flavor that I found unpalatable.  The Colgate version is gentle on my teeth and the flavor doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  My teeth feel healthy and clean after a gentle brushing and the whitening ingredients do not seem to bother me at all.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Over the past year I&#x27;ve developed a sensitivity to hot and especially cold, so the timing on this was perfect. We&#x27;ve been using Colgate Total Whitening paste for years because I drink a lot of coffee. The flavor of Sensitive Smartfoam with Whitening is comparable to Total Whitening, and after a few weeks seems just as effective in whitening, with less shock to my sensitive areas. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I am a committed Colgate user.  I typically use their Sensitive whitening or enamel protect versions with very good results.  I liked the advertisement of having a foaming toothpaste in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the packaging can be a little misleading.  It will say 30% more foaming action.  Asterisk: 30% more than their non-foaming toothpastes.  Well....sure....it&#x27;s going to possibly foam more than any non-foaming toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as far as the foaming?  I can&#x27;t tell the different.  Perhaps I have a strong memory of Mentadent or something.  But I can&#x27;t say that it foams, or feels like the &amp;#34;foaming action&amp;#34; is getting into the spaces between my teeth.  This is the only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But- if this was the only Colgate sensitive left on the market- I&#x27;d buy it.  It cleans well, my dental check ups are always excellent when I&#x27;ve been consistently using Colgate, and it does help with sensitivities.</li>
    <li> While this toothpaste seems to clean as well as any other, I did not like the taste.  It needs a touch of mint or wintergreen to make your mouth feel fresh.  As for the foaming, I may have noticed a little more foam, but I didn&#x27;t notice it getting in between my teeth any better than regular toothpaste.  All in all, this toothpaste is just so-so.</li>
    <li> I usually use Sensodyne whitening toothpaste, and this Colgate has one positive and one negative compared to the Sensodyne. This Colgate tastes a lot better than the Sensodyne. The Sensodyne can almost have a bitter taste, and the Colgate is sweet. The downside is that with a Sonicare toothbrush, the foaming action of the Colgate causes a mess. I do really like the Colgate paired with a manual toothbrush however.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste. I have sensitive teeth and need the whitening effect and thought I would try this about a year ago. My first thought was that it taste good and left my teeth feeling clean and I had good breathe from it. It took a couple of weeks for my to notice, but it did help with the sensitive teeth issue. I now can eat or drink cold or hot stuff without the pain from my teeth. I use it twice daily so I can&#x27;t say how long it will last if you stop using it, but it works so well for me that I&#x27;ll not stop using it to find that out. The only bad thing that I can even think of is the price. It is a little more than what I like to pay for toothpaste, but it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve tried private named toothpaste that is supposed to do the same thing, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as this brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated user of Sensodyne or Proenamel Sensodyne for over five years.  I&#x27;ve tried other toothpastes for sensitive teeth, but was never satisfied until now.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to review this for the vine program.  When I received my sample, I was experiencing some extra sensitivity in my lower molars even though I was brushing twice a day with Sensodyne.  I can honestly say that the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; sensitivity was gone within a few days of using Colgate Sensitive Smartfoam.  The package claims to create 30% more foam.  I don&#x27;t have any way of measuring the percentage, but it does create a substantial amount of foam compared to similar products that I&#x27;ve tried.  Overall, I love it and would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are interested, the antisensitivity ingredients in synsodyne and this brand are exactly the same (Potassium Nitrate 5%).  Given this fact, you would think the effect would be the same.  However, this brand eliminated the extra sensitivity I was feeling.  I switched back to sensodyne for a few days, but started noticed the sensitivity coming back.  The only thing I can think of that would probably make a difference is the foam.  Maybe the foam penetrates my teeth more and reaches areas that the sensodyne is not reaching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad Vine finally got some Colgate on their list, because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve long preferred to use.  As I found out with a couple tubes of Crest toothpaste, it leaves this annoying film in my mouth afterwards.  The Colgate doesn&#x27;t do that, which makes it a winner in my book.  Of course for me all the whitening and stuff is generally a moot point since they aren&#x27;t going to do much on a mouth full of crowns.  I like the foaminess as that makes me feel like it&#x27;s getting between the teeth better, which is good since I don&#x27;t like flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Colgate Total user.  For me, one who has had many bout with bleeding gums when I was younger man, Total proved to be the everyday solution to the problem.  A side effect was my teeth and gums were in better shape and therefore not nearly as sensitive to hot and cold.  With that in mind I figured I&#x27;d try Colgate Sensitive Smartfoam.  I&#x27;m going to be honest and I want to disclose my results are likely a coincidence and not actually caused by switching to this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Colgate Sensitive Smartfoam and retired my Colgate Total with Whitening.  At the end of the first week using the Smartfoam I had a problem and my gum began to bleed around a molar.  I added mouthwash prior to brushing thinking I needed to be sure the bleeding didn&#x27;t get infected or simply worsen.  It did as my jaw began to feel a slight pain and the bleeding was occurring every time I brushed.  By the second week I said I simply didn&#x27;t know if the Sensitive Smartfoam had anything to do with my problem, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t helping.  This toothpaste&#x27;s bottom line for me was it wasn&#x27;t working as eliminating sensitivity, I therefore went back to Colgate Total with Whitening which I truly believe is the best all-around tooth paste solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this toothpaste had anything to do with my problems and it would probably work if I didn&#x27;t have a gum issue flair-up, but for me it falls way behind the effectiveness I can depend on with Colgate Total.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about a tube of toothpaste, but I liked this stuff.  The taste is good and it seems to work about like most others.  The Smartfoam feature is definitely noticeable.  It seems to foam more than other toothpastes, almost like the way a shaving gel can make a huge lather out of a tiny squirt.  The result is that the toothpaste goes farther with less, seems to clean better, and is easier to rinse out of the mouth when you&#x27;re finished.  Hope you enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Colgate user since I was old enough to brush my teeth, so I am always trying new Colgate products whenever offered. Since I am &amp;#34;of an age&amp;#34; to need a product for sensitive teeth, this was a fortuitous offering. My observations: my teeth do feel better after using this toothpaste. I&#x27;m not certain if the &amp;#34;smartfoam&amp;#34; has anything to do with it. The taste is not as good as the Colgate gel flavors, but it is not a bad taste, either, and doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;baking soda&amp;#34; aftertaste that some other whitening toothpastes do. If you&#x27;re interested in my husband&#x27;s opinion, he says it is &amp;#34;OK,&amp;#34; but he prefers &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; to what he calls &amp;#34;mud.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t mind brushing with white paste myself.</li>
    <li> A perfectly fine tooth paste.  I know that&#x27;s a relatively generic review but let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s tooth paste what really am I supposed to say?  You put paste on a brush and scrub your teeth with it.  For that purpose it&#x27;s purposely fine.</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s better on my tongue than other sensitive whitening pastes have been. You need very little on account of the smart-foam, too.</li>
    <li> There is not much to say when writing a review on toothpaste. I have a moderately sensitive tooth, not really painful but noticeable with the average non-sensitive toothpaste. This Colgate version is completely without the normal &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; that most toothpastes have. In fact, it could give the impression that it is not as powerful, but so far I have had no problems.</li>
    <li> I normally use Colgate Sensitive EnamelProtect toothpastes, so I was very interested in finding out how this version compares to the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insofar as taste goes, this one actually tastes really good, it has a lot bursts of minty flavor while you are brushing so it really leaves you with a  fresh minty taste and feeling (especially welcome first thing in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste itself is a slight bit smoother in terms of texture, than the Colgate toothpaste I normally use, at least when you first start brushing.  The foam develops more like that of a fine foam, with softer feel to it than typical toothpastes.  In my case, I was using a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.  I don’t know if this had anything to do with it, but I really didn’t notice “more” foam, as much as I noticed the very distinctive feel to it. Even coming out of the tube, the toothpaste seemed to have a thick, yet smooth texture to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of sensitivity, it was tough for me to tell how good this version of Colgate Sensitive is over the one I use normally.  Any sensitive toothpaste will take time to actually have effect on your teeth.  Since I had already been using a similar version of the same brand, I really didn’t notice a difference.  That said, the whitening did seem to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as price is not any different than any other Colgate Sensitive toothpaste products, I would recommend giving this a try.  There are not a lot of good sensitive toothpastes that also whiten, while still tasting good and leaving you with a fresh (not chalky) feeling in your mouth.  This one is well worth a look.</li>
    <li> I use whitening toothpaste on a regular basis. To be honest, we typically go with whatever brand is on sale. I don&#x27;t have a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are times, however, when I deal with sensitivity issues and and I have to take a break and move to either traditional toothpaste or something for sensitivity for a short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this I was excited to try this product  since it offers something that will allow for daily whitening while dealing with sensitive mouths. The flavor is good. Minty but somewhat mild. I had anticipated that it would have a stronger &amp;#34;foaming action.&amp;#34; It didn&#x27;t. In fact, I had to read the labels on the tubes to identify which product I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to be gentle which is especially important to people who want to use a whitening agent daily without suffering pain. If possible, I&#x27;d give it 3.5 stars because it is a little pricey for a 6 oz. tube, but I&#x27;ll go with 4 stars per Amazon.com&#x27;s rating system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something that really foams and works its way in between your teeth and gums you could be disappointed. But, if you suffer from sensitivity want to use a whitening toothpaste regularly this would be a plausible solution.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toothpaste.  I switched over to it from Sensodyne.  It helps my sensitivity just as well as the Sensodyne, but it&#x27;s quite a bit cheaper and it tastes better.  I compared the ingredients one day in the store and the active ingredients are the same.</li>
    <li> Love this item number one for the fact that it really does help with sensitive teeth and love the foaming action. Taste is mild not too over powering.</li>
    <li> The foam is great for my wife. Stores in my area has quit carrying the foam.</li>
    <li> I love this smartform tooth paste -- I think it does a great job and I really love it -- I hope it will be available for a long time.</li>
    <li> Basically a soft smooth paste that foams a bit more in your mouth...yuck!  Not very minty either.  Must be some crazy new way to promote a product...not!</li>
    <li> I think my teeth are less sensitive after using this toothpaste for about 3 months.  Will continue using for a while.  Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent.</li>
    <li> Every major brand of toothpaste sells a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; variety, which contain potassium nitrate to decrease the sensitivity of your teeth. All the different brands have the same ingredients, so it&#x27;s really just a matter of finding one whose taste you like. Sensodyne is good, but it tends to be more expensive. Colgate is a very good option, and I use it daily. Effective, with a pretty good flavor.</li>
    <li> It is rare that a review product gets me to change brands but this one does. I normally use Sensodyne toothpaste for my sensitive teeth but this Colgate does the job and alleviates any sensitivity after I use it daily. It is also a little different than other toothpastes because it foams up to make it have more volume when brushing. You only need a small dab, it foams up and gives you enough volume to easily brush your teeth with. It has a great neutral minty flavor as well. I liked it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect toothpaste for my sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ve suffered for years and, unfortunately, though effective, Sensodyne is just too expensive. This toothpaste works and is in my budget.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste!  Haven&#x27;t seen this Smartfoam in the stores, I would recommend it to others who like colgate sensitive toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste I use and it works...will keep your smile BRIGHT!  :-)</li>
    <li> No kidding this will have your mouth spilling out with light foam from this toothpaste. It makes you feel like there&#x27;s more cleaning going on but I wouldn&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a scientific fact or not. I dislike toothpastes that give you no foam (baking soda type toothpastes are like that) but this is on the other end of the extreme. I personally don&#x27;t mind it but I don&#x27;t need it as well. It&#x27;s ok but I&#x27;ll probably go back to standard colgate paste for the next tube. Hope this review helps a little in making your decision!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product just is not strong enough for my sensitive teeth; I have had to switch to prescription-strength toothpaste. However, if Colgate&#x27;s previous formulation of sensitive toothpaste was strong enough for you, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is an upgrade -- it definitely produces more and thicker foam than before, which can only improve the coverage.</li>
    <li> This is our new favorite toothpaste.  Great mint flavor.  Good whitening but the best part is the &amp;#34;Smartfoam&amp;#34;(that is actually pretty funny how everything is &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; now, even &amp;#34;smartfoam&amp;#34;), it really foams up which means if you use your normal amount of toothpaste your mouth will look like an over flowing washing machine.  You just need a little.  Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I needed a sensitive formula toothpaste after my last visit to the dentist. Suddenly all my teeth were overly sensitized and I really cannot stomach the Sensodyne toothpaste anymore. I needed a toothpaste that was non-abrasive, helped the sensitivity, and would still taste ok. Colgate&#x27;s Smartfoam is excellent! I like the foamy toothpaste as it in not abrasive in the least. It has a mild minty taste and doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach. And after two weeks of using it, my teeth are less sensitive. So it does really work!</li>
    <li> My wife and I started using this toothpaste. I don&#x27;t suffer from sensitive teeth, but it&#x27;s easier if we share. She loves the flavor and finds this product works to reduce temperature sensitivity. I am not fond of the texture and flavor. This product feels very &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;. Unlike other Colgate toothpastes, there is no abrasive feeling. The flavor is mild. We have not noticed any whitening effect after a week of use. I&#x27;m not surprised. I have never gotten any particular whitening from any over the counter tooth cleaning product.</li>
    <li> Colgate Maximum Strength Sensitive SmartFoam with Whitening Toothpaste works to remove stains while providing fast relief (generally within 2 weeks) to sensitivity. It helps to build increased protection against painful sensitivity of teeth due to cold, heat, acids, sweets, or general contact for long-term relief. Colgate Maximum Strength Sensitive SmartFoam with Whitening Toothpaste also helps to protect against cavities for a healthier mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Provides fast relief within 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;*30% more foam gets tough-to-reach places and helps keep teeth whiter&lt;br /&gt;*Builds increasing protection against sudden shocks of painful sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;*Provides long-term relief with regular use&lt;br /&gt;*Contains fluoride for cavity protection&lt;br /&gt;*Great-tasting flavor; helps keep teeth whiter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used Colgate toothpaste since I was younger. However, the older I got, the more sensitive my teeth became and I switched to Crest because Colgate didn&#x27;t have a sensitive formula that I liked......however after trying this, I am switching back!! I loved using this toothpaste, it really leaves your mouth with a clean and fresh feeling. The smartfoam glides across your teeth and they feel really, really clean!! I will be making a permnaent switch to this product!</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste.  Good job of cleaning and whitening my teeth.  And I have sensitive teeth, especially to cold.  Having used this toothpaste I have no problems now.  As for the 30% more foam claim, I cannot verify that as I have no way to measure.  There is more foam than with regular toothpastes I have used and I like that.  The foam makes me more confident I am reaching all the tight spots and my gums.  As for taste it does not have much and I am fine with that also.  I do recommend it and will continue using it myself.</li>
    <li> this is great!  there are so many sensitive toothpastes now -- it&#x27;s kind of overwhelming trying to decide what to buy.  thought i&#x27;d try a couple of new ones and see if i like them.  this one is good for me!  pleasant taste, effective.  haven&#x27;t noticed it being overly foamy, seems about the same as my other toothpaste.  some of the toothpastes now have an ingredient that burns my mouth but this does not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne for years but thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. Very glad I did since it tastes much better than Sensodyne. The mint is very fresh-tasting versus the more &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; taste of the Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concentration of potassium nitrate is the same as Sensodyne (5%) and I&#x27;ve noticed zero difference in how well it works to help eliminate tooth sensitivity. Plus, the foaming action seems to help disperse everything to ensure good tooth coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this, and will be getting more.</li>
    <li> Use it every single day..great product!!!</li>
