      <li>The flip tops are difficult to open and close and don&#x27;t seem to be as good at protecting the product as he screw on tops.</li>
      <li>This was far cheaper than local pharmacies for a quality product.</li>
      <li>Value for money, this product is very costly if you go to any of the other retail stores or pharmacy across USA</li>

    <li> Great product.  Cannot find anything bad to say about this product.  it does what it supposes to do for a good price.</li>
    <li> This is a nice kit for contact lenses care with good price. It came in perfect condition. I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> With all the complaints why don&#x27;t they go back to the screw-on tops that consumers prefer?  The flip tops are difficult to open and close and don&#x27;t seem to be as good at protecting the product as he screw on tops.</li>
    <li> Much, much less expensive than you&#x27;ll find in any store.  Plus a few nice little extras.  This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> This was a good price and the merchandise was as represented in the ad - I&#x27;m pleased. Saved quite a bit over Costco shopping</li>
    <li> My doctor recommend me this one for cleaning the contact glasses of my cousin,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be again soon,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought 3 pack, good price, too.</li>
    <li> The price I spent here would have only bought one bottle of either cleaner or conditioner at a local store. In this kit you get both solutions in the standard retail size, plus a case, plus 4 of the enzyme cleaner dispensers. The expiration dates are all well out and the package was sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a second kit (March 2011) and it arrived on the 2nd day after I placed my order (ordered online Thursday, was at my door on Saturday). That&#x27;s from New York to Montana for $3.05 shipping (bought from Shop CLE)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this kit and it is a wonderful cheap deal. cleaner + protein remover and a 105 ml advance Boston formula all in one pack. I guarantee you will never need to buy every item separately. I am gonna to buy 2 more of this item.</li>
    <li> the best alternative for cleaning gas permeable contact lenses !!!!!, I have tried with many other products for more than 35 years and this is the best !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Boston products for years, but the Boston Advance product line is the very best.  Sadly, in the stores it&#x27;s just not cheap!  This is a SUPER BUY and I&#x27;d advise others to stock up.  I have over a year on their expiration date and hope when I need more it&#x27;s still on Amazon.........In these tough economic times, this is a SUPER BARGAIN!</li>
    <li> This was far cheaper than local pharmacies for a quality product. The expiration is 10 months out which is plenty of time to use it.</li>
    <li> PPP&#x3D;Perfectly pleasing purchase</li>
    <li> These are handy sizes for travel and everyday use while&lt;br /&gt;being carried in my handbag.  The can be refilled from&lt;br /&gt;larger containers as well.</li>
    <li> Value for money, this product is very costly if you go to any of the other retail stores or pharmacy across USA</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve found for this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 6 years, now.  It contains two bottles: a cleaner and a conditioner, which is a different setup from the all-in-one solutions which are common nowadays.</li>
    <li> As others say, the price is great. Only downside is that the item description says it has rewetting drops but the box has 4 single-use enzyme cleaner packets instead of the rewetting drops. That costs them a star.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same product, at a better price, and it&#x27;s delivered to my front door.  What isn&#x27;t there to like about that?</li>
    <li> At the time I purchased this, it was $3 less than the price of just the 3.5 fl. oz. bottle of Boston Conditioning Solution at the local big-name pharmacy. I purchased this product from AC Lens and the expiration date on all three items are 2.5-3 years in the future, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting an out-of-date product.</li>
    <li> This product contains a wetting solution, cleaning solution and an enzymatic cleaner. I have used other wetting/conditioning solutions and no one comes closer to Boston&#x27;s. The cleaning kit is excellent and you can feel the difference after treating the lens with the enzymatic cleaner. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used to get individual bottles every time I needed new solution, but with this kit it all comes in one box that&#x27;s cheaper than buying everything separately. The daily cleaning solution is very important for keeping your hard contacts in perfect condition and I don&#x27;t use the protein remover often, but it does seem to help when I do use it. This kit even has a case in it, which is nice because you are supposed to replace your case often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit really has everything one needs and it&#x27;s exactly what my eye doctor gave me when I first got my contacts. I don&#x27;t purchase anything else now.</li>
    <li> These drops are not only conveniently stored with the enclosed free lens case, but make wearing lenses unnoticeable. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product until I can no longer wear lenses.</li>
