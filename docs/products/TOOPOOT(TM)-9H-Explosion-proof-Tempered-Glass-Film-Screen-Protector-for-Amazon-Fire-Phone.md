### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This protector looks great and a quality made product but just not for the Fire Phone.     </li>
      <li>This is really good protection  </li>
      <li>You will end up using the power button to wake up your phone but rating it 3 because it is still for the money the best screen protector you can find for fire phone that does not cost more that the phone itself :-)</li>
      <li>Good idea need to find better way to implement!</li>
      <li>Yes, I am very satisfied with this item</li>
      <li>I had at first given this TOOPOOT Tempered glass Screen Protector 5 stars as it fit great &amp; seem better than any screen protector I had ever installed.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is fine.</li>
      <li>the fire phone exactly and looks great very sensitive to touch and cleans easier...</li>
      <li>I double check All the holes for proximity sensors all are clear and perfectly cutout no overlap.</li>
      <li>Quality is good but, not suitable for my fire phone.</li>
      <li>Very aggravating to have to use the menu button and even then sometimes it does not work.  </li>
      <li>Would have been great but cut out in wrong place .</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it causes the Amazon Fire phone to malfunction during phone calls, all other features worked flawless.</li>
      <li>Quality product with fast shipping and low price</li>
      <li>The quality of the product itself is good, but unfortunately, it came with the precut holes off and it wouldn&#x27;t line up correctly</li>
      <li>Amazon replaced the phone 2 times I was on third and each time had same exact problem.    </li>
      <li>Wasted many hours trying to debug this by changing settings attempting to fix it as I could not understand how other customer weren&#x27;t screaming about this problem.</li>
      <li>Also the screen goes blank unexpectedly</li>
      <li>and it is way better than the thin film ones</li>

<li> Sorry for downgrade</li>
<li> but it made it impossible to use my phone .</li>

    <li> Quality is good but, not suitable for my fire phone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fire,phone and it caused my screen to malfunction. I don&#x27;t think my phone lines anything on it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. You cannot hang up your phone. The protector messes with the proximity sensor and it never knows when you are no longer holding the phone to your ear.</li>
    <li> It was not meant for my Fire and caused it to malfunction.  I had to remove it and throw it away.  It covered the four corner sensors,</li>
    <li> The quality of the product itself is good, but unfortunately, it came with the precut holes off and it wouldn&#x27;t line up correctly</li>
    <li> said it was for a fire phone but it is not</li>
    <li> Did Not worked with my fire phone sensors it was blocking it.Cannot use it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t it broke while I was putting on my phone while I was following there instructions and now I can&#x27;t get it returned to them for a refund</li>
    <li> This is really good protection  and it is way better than the thin film ones no Bubbles comes with cleaner and cloth and a dust remover&lt;br /&gt;fits the fire phone exactly and looks great very sensitive to touch and cleans easier...I recommend this product and it fits perfectly&lt;br /&gt;with my hardened case</li>
    <li> It would not pay to return this but it made it impossible to use my phone . I almost returned my phone till I took off the shield and found out it was that not the phone. Good idea need to find better way to implement!</li>
    <li> Yes, I am very satisfied with this item</li>
    <li> Would have been great but cut out in wrong place .</li>
    <li> I had trouble putting it on.  Otherwise, it is fine.</li>
    <li> Quality product with fast shipping and low price</li>
    <li> I had at first given this TOOPOOT Tempered glass Screen Protector 5 stars as it fit great &amp; seem better than any screen protector I had ever installed. Unfortunately it causes the Amazon Fire phone to malfunction during phone calls, all other features worked flawless. This is the only reason for downgrade.    I place the TOOPOOT Screen Protector immediately on my new Amazon Fire Phone before using, unbeknownst that the Fire phone during calls would become unresponsive and screen becomes totally dark. No buttons could bring any response to the phone requiring you to hold power button till it shut off.    Unfortunately when I contacted AMAZON customer service they were not aware of this, they had me Restore the phone to factory defaults which wipes out all contacts and email and of course Restore only brings back the apps installed.   I also spent hours doing a searches to locate anyone having same problem. Wasted many hours trying to debug this by changing settings attempting to fix it as I could not understand how other customer weren&#x27;t screaming about this problem. Amazon replaced the phone 2 times I was on third and each time had same exact problem.    Each time when receiving replacement I peeled off this screen protector as it is rigid removal is easy with no damage and just placed on next phone only to have all three phones rendered useless during calls.    I once again searched Amazon customer reviews and found someone who had discovered the screen protector causing the trouble. I double check All the holes for proximity sensors all are clear and perfectly cutout no overlap. This protector looks great and a quality made product but just not for the Fire Phone.     Sorry for downgrade but again I think only with the Fire Phone it is a problem.</li>
    <li> Well I hate that it&#x27;s coming from China on a junk with apparently a 1 arm oarsman. I&#x27;ll be returning it WHENEVER it gets here because we are returning the Fire phone. Even if we were keeping the phone, it was a mistake to order this, the turn-around time is RIDICULOUS.</li>
    <li> Some sensors are blocked which prevents the phone from functioning properly . You will end up using the power button to wake up your phone but rating it 3 because it is still for the money the best screen protector you can find for fire phone that does not cost more that the phone itself :-)</li>
    <li> No did not fit my Amazon fire phone  broke as I was trying to put on phone</li>
    <li> Wish I had seen these reviews before buying the product.  The protective cover does interfere with the sensors.  Very aggravating to have to use the menu button and even then sometimes it does not work.  Also the screen goes blank unexpectedly and you can&#x27;t get it back when you are on a call.  Recommend this not be purchased until they modify the openings.</li>
    <li> No good. Turns my phone screen completely black, when making a phone call.</li>
    <li> Not usable as the holes did not line up on the face of Amazon Fire Phone</li>
    <li> will not work with the ciney case.it presses on the screen too hard.</li>
