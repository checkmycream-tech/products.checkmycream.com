      <li>Neem Plant Silk Serum leaves your hair shiny and healthy both my daughter</li>
      <li>Like I said, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything and these four products really do my hair good :)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink up or anything, isn&#x27;t strong, but does have an odor, so you may or may not like it.  </li>
      <li>feels good and natural, very light, and helps make your hair look silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>The free shipping was a deal maker.  </li>
      <li>, My hair is smooth and silky and flowing to the touch.</li>
      <li>It tames and softens my coarse, wavy hair very nicely.  </li>
      <li>Most either made my hair too greasy or smelled kind of funny, and in the end, just didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>Wish it wasnt so pricey but worth it!</li>
      <li>Im a true addict for this serum.</li>
      <li>While my hair will never be the silky-smooth it used to be way back before I started coloring it, this serum surely gets me close!  </li>
      <li>It was hard to find, so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I also love the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque that&#x27;s out on the market</li>
      <li>I will continue to order it at Amazon for as long as they offer it at such a great price.</li>
      <li>So, ok, I am a guy who is getting up there and starting to lose hair.  </li>
      <li>So, like most of us who have put our hair through the ringer, I&#x27;ve tried so many different oils and leave-in conditioners to try and get my hair as close to soft again as possible.  </li>
      <li>Fructis makes a brilliantine spray and a nourishing spray that do the same thing for a fraction of the cost and which are easy to find at Wal-Mart or a drugstore.  </li>
      <li>It really helps to keep my frizzy hair manageable.  </li>
      <li>but I noticed that my hair felt really silky and even seemed to hold</li>
      <li>IT NICE REALLY HEAVY</li>
      <li>IVE TRIED MANY SERUMS CHEAP AND EXPENSIVE</li>
      <li>Saw this product reviewed in a magazine and decided to try it left my hair silky and soft, Very manageable and very shiny after applying it,  Would highly recommend it</li>
      <li>AND BY FAR</li>
      <li>Must use generously, much is not needed and results are INSTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>but I think I think the product that I was supposed to receive was replaced or the product was old</li>
      <li>Made my hair a bit flat and shine wasn&#x27;t particularly there.</li>

<ol>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product i have ever used... my hair is like silk and totally under control after i use it... plus, it never leaves an oily residue or weighs my hair down... i absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I  am not quit sure but I think I think the product that I was supposed to receive was replaced or the product was old the smell and consistency of the product was not the same as previous bottles I have used. I had to throw it away, was disappointed I love this product...</li>
    <li> The best investment I ever made on any hair product everytime I use my hair feels like silk til my next washing</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and have tried a zillion different products over the years.  Most either made my hair too greasy or smelled kind of funny, and in the end, just didn&#x27;t really do much.  Then I tried the Lanza Serum.  This stuff was incredible.  For once, I felt like my hair was soft and silky, and not dry and dull.  I&#x27;ve been using a similar product to save some money, and well, it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.  I&#x27;m going to shell out the extra bucks for another bottle of this stuff.  It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> So, ok, I am a guy who is getting up there and starting to lose hair.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t make it come back but it does make the hair feel better, hang better, and it smells good, too!  Even my wife noticed the smell and liked it.  It doesn&#x27;t stink up or anything, isn&#x27;t strong, but does have an odor, so you may or may not like it.  But I do.  Shuh, that&#x27;s why I buy it!</li>
    <li> Neem Plant Silk Serum leaves your hair shiny and healthy both my daughter and I love it.  I only wish it would come in a bigger bottle as we would not be without it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 8 months. The bottle lasted me a long time. It took about a month of using it ( I only wash my hair about twice a week) but I noticed that my hair felt really silky and even seemed to hold it&#x27;s style a little longer than normal. I didn&#x27;t buy any more after the bottle ran out and of course, out went the shine and silkyness. It&#x27;s expensive but worth the price in my opinion. Dry, damaged hair not only looks bad but feels bad.</li>
    <li> Im a true addict for this serum. Must use generously, much is not needed and results are INSTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE, My hair is smooth and silky and flowing to the touch. Rollersets, flat iron, wraps, must use with all! Wish it wasnt so pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, really strengthens hair and makes it shine like silk.  I received it faster than anticipated.  Excellent service.</li>
    <li> This product does what it claims to do, at least for me.  It tames and softens my coarse, wavy hair very nicely.  Fructis makes a brilliantine spray and a nourishing spray that do the same thing for a fraction of the cost and which are easy to find at Wal-Mart or a drugstore.  I probably won&#x27;t order this again even though it works, and will stick with Fructis.</li>
    <li> I have used Lanza Neem Plant Silk for years.  It really helps to keep my frizzy hair manageable.  The price I found at Amazon was much better than anything in stores in my area.  The free shipping was a deal maker.  I will continue to order it at Amazon for as long as they offer it at such a great price.</li>

    <li> Great product and lightweight! Does not weight hair down and still gives body. Has worked wonders on my hair and repaired due to processing of highlights/perm, curling iron, and hair dryer. Would recommend and won&#x27;t go without!</li>
    <li> You do not need very much of this product but it works great.  I have fine hair so use very little but my hair is silky smooth and feels very healthy.</li>
    <li> love this product.  tames my thick hair without looking greasy</li>
    <li> Terrific hair item..........tames unruly frizzy hair, without being greasy. It was hard to find, so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and is light weight in your hair, gives it shine and makes your hair healthy and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great! I love it. I use it almost everyday cause my hair would be fried without it. Would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Gives good results.</li>
    <li> So, like most of us who have put our hair through the ringer, I&#x27;ve tried so many different oils and leave-in conditioners to try and get my hair as close to soft again as possible.  I recently went from red to blond, which put extra strain on my hair (which is long...down my back, so it needs a little extra lovin&#x27;&#x27;).  My hair salon recommended this product, so I tried it and love it!  While my hair will never be the silky-smooth it used to be way back before I started coloring it, this serum surely gets me close!

    <li> IVE TRIED MANY SERUMS CHEAP AND EXPENSIVE AND BY FAR THIS IS THE GREATEST.  IT NICE REALLY HEAVY AND DOESN&#x27;T MAKE YOUR HAIR GREASY :).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two years and love it!!! I&#x27;ve ordered it for my mom and sister too!</li>
