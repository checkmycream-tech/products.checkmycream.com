      <li>I love the Keranique products.</li>
      <li>love it.  </li>
      <li>Cheap dollar store mousse works better than this.</li>
      <li>strongly recommend</li>
      <li>When you have fine or thinning hair, you cannot use products that &amp;#34;weigh the hair</li>
      <li>Not all mousses work on my fine hair and this one does.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair.</li>
      <li>I noticed several reviews weren&#x27;t that great.  </li>
      <li>I purchase the keranique shampoo and conditioner which I was using about 3 months with great results my hair was growing back</li>
      <li>Nothing special considering the cost.</li>
      <li>There are far better styling products for that amount of money.</li>
      <li>A product that will make u smile.</li>
      <li>I actually think that this product does give my hair more texture</li>
      <li>but I like a different product better</li>
      <li>it was &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m nearly positive this was caused by using too&lt;</li>
      <li>Just not the best texturizing I&#x27;ve used, my hair feels dirty after it dries.</li>
      <li>so I really like it.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast and was as described</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really thicken my hair.  </li>
      <li>Works very well and would have gotten 5 stars</li>
      <li>but I will continue using  the shampoo and conditioner because I want my hair back because I am tired of wigs,other than that very good product!!!</li>
      <li>this particular product does give my hair some body.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try it at least one more time.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product for short hair.  </li>
      <li>hair rather than putting in directly on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Did make it really soft.</li>
      <li>,, I see &amp; feel a major difference in my hairs thickness!</li>
      <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
      <li>works wonders on thin hair and glad I found it</li>
      <li>It left my thin, fine hair soft and silky, but with a lot of body.  </li>
      <li>A little better than the other products, but does dry your hair out if used too often!</li>
      <li>Makes your hair feel full and thick and smoothe.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker especially when the hair issue is due to older age and/or hypothyroidism</li>

    <li> It does not thicken or contribute to styling your hair - don&#x27;t waste your money.  There are far better styling products for that amount of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m encouraged, but, too soon to know if I LOVE IT.  Its expensive, so, I must wait and see.  Good chance I&#x27;ll try it at least one more time.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair fuller when I blow dry it. I would recommend this product for women whose hair is thinning.</li>

    <li> Been using this product for quite a while now and I do believe that it does help my hair feel fuller</li>
    <li> Cheap dollar store mousse works better than this. Did not live up to it&#x27;s boast.</li>
    <li> Have only used the product once, so it is unfair to rate it until later. If it works I&#x27;ll be sold.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair look and feel thicker.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really thicken my hair.  It made my hair stiff and hard to handle.  I just didn&#x27;t help me at all.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice moose and can be used with or without the Keranique shampoo.  Makes your hair feel full and thick and smoothe.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me was a waste of money&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t even tell you put anything in your hair&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to order this from Amazon.  I was given this by a  friend and&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  I noticed several reviews weren&#x27;t that great.  Just a note ... you&lt;br /&gt;use very little of this and I put the mousse in my hand and then on&lt;br /&gt;my hair rather than putting in directly on my hair.  Someone mentioned&lt;br /&gt;that it was &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m nearly positive this was caused by using too&lt;br /&gt;much.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used for volume and thickening.</li>
    <li> Just not the best texturizing I&#x27;ve used, my hair feels dirty after it dries.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have ever used!!!  I even take it to hairdresser when I go there and she says it is wonderful on my hair</li>
    <li> I love Keranique products but this one makes my hair feel greasy.  It ,doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how much or little l use</li>
    <li> product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Thickens the hair without messy gooey feel adds texture and lift no perfumery odor lasts well for thinning hair needs</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and I use Keranique products to help.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker especially when the hair issue is due to older age and/or hypothyroidism but it does help and this particular product does give my hair some body.  It doesn&#x27;t take much product for short hair.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> A little better than the other products, but does dry your hair out if used too often! Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> Works very well and would have gotten 5 stars but I like a different product better</li>
    <li> Luv this mousse! Makes hair hold curls longer ...bouncy but thick feeling..the curls that is!!</li>
    <li> Like their other products that I tried but this one just made my hair feel dirty. Tried twice and will not use again</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful,it has made my hair thicker and provided coverage where needed plus fullness .  A product that will make u smile.</li>
    <li> The trick is to use only a little...the size of a quarter is enough.  It left my thin, fine hair soft and silky, but with a lot of body.  When you have fine or thinning hair, you cannot use products that &amp;#34;weigh the hair down.&amp;#34;  I got great results the very first time I used this!</li>
    <li> I love the Keranique products. My hair is getting thinner, and these products give it extra volume</li>
    <li> I have used many volumizing hair products and Keranique products are the best!  Not sure if it actually regrows the hair but it does make my  thinning hair stronger and fuller!  I will be using these products for a long time!</li>
    <li> Works no better than other off the shelf products that dont do much.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I LOVED the shampoo, but this mouse did nothing for my hair.  In fact I had to wash it out.</li>
    <li> I purchase the keranique shampoo and conditioner which I was using about 3 months with great results my hair was growing back bald spots and edges were filling in very happy camper lol, until I applied the keranique mousse  to my hair what did I do that for now I have to start back over again, I dont know what I did wrong help!!! lol I Know the instructions tell you to DO NOT PUT ANYTHING IN YOUR HAIR, but my thing is its a keranique product why not use it on my hair ,I dont understand that  but I will continue using  the shampoo and conditioner because I want my hair back because I am tired of wigs,other than that very good product!!! strongly recommend</li>
    <li> I actually think that this product does give my hair more texture and I&#x27;m happy about that.</li>
    <li> I received Keranique Thickening and Texturizing Mouse.  I have not used it long enough to tell if it works. I am sure hoping it does. Shipping and packaging couldn&#x27;t have been better and quicker. The description sounds great, so I hope I am one person it works for.</li>
    <li> Not all mousses work on my fine hair and this one does.  So I do keep ordering this brand!</li>
