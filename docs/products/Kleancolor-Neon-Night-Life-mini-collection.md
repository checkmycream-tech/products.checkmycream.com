      <li>collection and that is true to the T!  </li>
      <li>the yellow is okay, but the rest are great...  </li>
      <li>Very bold</li>
      <li>They were rather cheap though</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely cheap nail polish which may do the trick, but if you&#x27;re looking for a kick ass coat, I would go with China Glaze products.</li>
      <li>SO THESE SMALLER SIZES ARE GREAT.</li>
      <li>The nail polish is cheap but worked for the occasion.</li>
      <li>Colours for every occasion, and very eye catching.</li>
      <li>Cute and colorful.</li>
      <li>very powerful color.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try it that I had to use my swatch wheel.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try then out but couldn&#x27;t decide which color.</li>
      <li>probably good for younger girls.</li>
      <li>COLORS TRUE TO COLOR IN BOTTLE.</li>
      <li>Although all of the colors take multiple coats for full coverage, the colors are gorgeous and get lots of compliments</li>
      <li>Fun colors, kind of reminded me a little of crayons when the colors go on but good if you are looking for fun colors to wear or to use on children</li>

      <li>I luckily didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
      <li>is kind of thick (not in a good way).</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>I suppose if you have very large talons they might only be good for one use.  </li>
      <li>Great for little girls&#x27; get togethers.</li>
      <li>but once applied multiple times looks really nice</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>When the colors dry, they leave a really cheap look and the polish chips very easily.</li>
      <li>All the other colors looked good tho.</li>
      <li>and i put it on right away</li>
      <li>Overall an ok polish.</li>
      <li>Buy a top coat lasting wear if you want it to last more than a day.</li>
      <li>First of all the colors are all wrong,then the freaking bottles are SOOOO SMALLL ..</li>
      <li>this nail polish is pretty  </li>
      <li>some were dry, but okay</li>
      <li>I loved the colors in this set, but when I went to use them, more than half were all dried out and did not spread evenly, or i would have rated this item higher.</li>
      <li>i really like the purple  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really like the brush and the polish</li>
      <li>More than I expected.  </li>
      <li>But can&#x27;t beat the price they are small but good for young ladies.</li>
      <li>nice but too small ....</li>
      <li>Quick shipping, just as described, I have came back again to order this one!  </li>
      <li>Vibrant colors.</li>
      <li>They offered either a full refund or a new shipment of the same item.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This nail set is great for the young and Old! I purchased a kit for my grand-daughters and they love the colors. The polish is user friendly and not messy, easy to remove with nail polish and great for the price!</li>
    <li> The lighter color like orange, yellow and green didn&#x27;t go on well but I did like the blue and purple.  It&#x27;s definitely cheap nail polish which may do the trick, but if you&#x27;re looking for a kick ass coat, I would go with China Glaze products.</li>
    <li> The orange I recieved was leaked and they are relativy small bottles. But other than that the product is exactly what the picture appears to be.</li>
    <li> some were dry, but okay</li>
    <li> kids loved it age 10- 13 and 14</li>
    <li> Bottles are .17 oz, bit smaller than I thought but still great.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t see how some of these are neon, but the ones that are are great.</li>
    <li> Colours for every occasion, and very eye catching. Wish the bottles were a little larger but love them  &amp; would definitely reorder</li>
    <li> nice but too small ....</li>
    <li> love the nail polish the yellow is okay, but the rest are great...  now you need to come out with nail polish that glows in the dark</li>
    <li> Although all of the colors take multiple coats for full coverage, the colors are gorgeous and get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> This works well.  I like the color and consistency of this polish.  It stays on about the same length of time as any other brand in this price range.  Will continue to buy and use this brand.</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for my daughter&#x27;s spa birthday party. She turned 12. The nail polish is a good variety of colors for this preteen group. The nail polish is cheap but worked for the occasion.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery. Cute and colorful. Vibrant colors. Tiny bottles (which is why they&#x27;re mini). Purchased as a gift so cannot rate products performance.</li>
    <li> Fun colors, kind of reminded me a little of crayons when the colors go on but good if you are looking for fun colors to wear or to use on children</li>
    <li> Not satisfy i gave it to my daughters their really small</li>
    <li> Totally love this !! They&#x27;re cute colors , and there&#x27;s no bad thing about them !! Although they&#x27;re really small and will finish soon , they&#x27;re worth it (::</li>
    <li> bottles of polish were much smaller than i expected but very powerful color. you have to use more than one coat but once applied multiple times looks really nice</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail today. Arrived in good time. I was excited to try then out but couldn&#x27;t decide which color. So, I tried them all. Was disappointed that my favorite ( Neon Green) was globby... somewhat dried out, but nothing a lil polish remover couldn&#x27;t help. Then the brushes on 3 more colors were frayed, making them almost impossible to paint with. I ended up using a fine makeup brush instead and it worked great. Still going to use them because the colors are beautiful but won&#x27;t be ordering this again</li>
    <li> how sad when u go to paint nails they cant because the color is dry up sad and sad and awful</li>
    <li> I hosted a Spa Birthday Party for my daughter and ordered these to set up the &amp;#34;Nail&amp;#34; station. She loved it and the polish was great!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, just as described, I have came back again to order this one!  Great price!  great stocking stuffer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered 2 sets</li>
    <li> When this product was received, I found one bottle to be half empty, and it was solid.  When I tried shaking the bottle, there was no liquid at all.  I notified the company of the problem, and they immediately apologized for the problem.  They offered either a full refund or a new shipment of the same item.  I was very satisfied with this response.  I notified them that I wanted a new shipment of the same product, since this was ordered as part of a gift.  I&#x27;m waiting to receive the new item.</li>
    <li> Because one of the nail polish(green one) is dry. Also because i tried the red one in my nails and is not neon. Just a regular red</li>
    <li> Sent these as a gift and she loved them!</li>
    <li> this nail polish is pretty  i really like the purple  does take at least two coats  the price was very good.</li>
    <li> I NEVER FINISH A NAIL POLISH BOTTLE SO THESE SMALLER SIZES ARE GREAT. COLORS TRUE TO COLOR IN BOTTLE. EXCELLENT COVERAGE AND IT STAYED ON MY NAILS FOR 10 DAYS. I DON&#x27;T HAVE ACRYLIC NAILS AND I BATHED THE DOG TWICE..WASHED DISHES BY HAND..CLEANED ..DUSTED..MOPPED..JUST NORMAL ROUTINE. IT LASTED QUITE A LONG TIME</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift because I thought the idea of having the colors of the rainbow was cute. Let me start off by saying that you do not get the colors in the photograph. I got a black in the set I received, meaning that one of the other colors was missing. When the colors dry, they leave a really cheap look and the polish chips very easily. It was a cute idea, but I&#x27;m not buying nail polish from this company again.</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift and am not too pleased with them. I can&#x27;t even use them, even after thinning it out a bit. Cute colors but can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Such bright and brilliant colours. Quick delivery. Perfect condition. Everyone commented on them and the designs I did with them.</li>
    <li> Great vibrant colors! 10 year loved them! Perfect stocking filler! More colors would be nice in a separate box also...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my manicure loving niece... I guess neon colors are hard to find and she went crazy for this.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter-in-law as a Christmas present.  She loves painting her nails wild colors and these certainly filled her love of color.</li>
    <li> I loved the colors in this set, but when I went to use them, more than half were all dried out and did not spread evenly, or i would have rated this item higher.</li>
    <li> First of all the colors are all wrong,then the freaking bottles are SOOOO SMALLL .. I could only use these bottles on my 6 year old niece SOOO DISAPPOINTED.. IF it wasnt such a pain in the A$$ to send back I would of as soon i opened the box.. I felt so ashamed when i opened the box.. :( NEVER AGAIN THEY SHOULD SEND ME MY MONEY BACK</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas present  for my daughter and the purple polish appeared to have spelled like the lid was not on right.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Best deal.More than I expected.  Wonderful colors. I would recommend this a friend to buy. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My order came very fast which was awesome because everything else I ordered is taking its time. However the nail polish was cheap and a great product for the price. It lasts pretty long and goes on thick so really no need for a second coat maybe on the lighter colors. Overall great product and will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> i got the nail polish a couple of days erlier then expected and i put it on right away then i put it on my dads nails it was amazing!!! the colors a very bright!!!</li>
    <li> These are great colors for summer!  I know it says &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; collection and that is true to the T!  The bottles are very small and you wouldn&#x27;t have enough to paint all your nails but for nail art they worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little worried about ordering it after seeing the other rates for it about it coming dry or never came at all.But when it came i was very pleased with it. None were dry and it came 3 days before I thought it would! Definitely ordering from this place again</li>
    <li> nice colors my daughter is crazy about the nail polish. i bought a lot with different colors. hours of fun!!!!</li>
    <li> Bottles were MUCH smaller than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how the blue is neon. Also the blue was clunky and wasnt much of a liquid. I got these for water marble nails and it worked but I had to redo them because it would get blobby. They were rather cheap though so I&#x27;m not very surprised or upset.</li>
    <li> Great colors. Buy a top coat lasting wear if you want it to last more than a day. Very bold</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have been able to order the nail polish before Christmas.  They will make great gifts for my granddaughters who are fashion divas.</li>
    <li> Nothing super great about this collection. These minis are just ok. They are neon as expected. Great for little girls&#x27; get togethers.</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday. I was so excited to try it that I had to use my swatch wheel. They were all very good colors and so pretty.The only one that took more than 2 coats to be opaque was the green. That could of been my fault as I did thin coats. I have not been able to use them yet on my nails as I have on fake nails, but so looking forward to getting to wear them. The little mini bottles are so cute as well. As I stated, I have not gotten to wear them yet, so can&#x27;t tell you the longevity of them. The colors from the blue to the yellow on the swatch wheel are the colors I received.</li>
    <li> Not any better than any finger nail polish, it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Polish is a bit thick and takes a while to dry.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, and the recipient was very pleased with this set.</li>
    <li> Shipping was great! Got here very fast and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like the brush and the polish is kind of thick (not in a good way). I thinned them out a little and they went on a little nicer after that. I read that a lot of people had trouble with theirs being dried out. I luckily didn&#x27;t have that problem. I didn&#x27;t really think the blue or red were very neon but they were still a nice color. Overall an ok polish. I&#x27;ve used and seen worse. For $6 it&#x27;s a pretty good deal. They dry pretty fast and didn&#x27;t chip so probably good for younger girls.</li>
    <li> These little guys are fun and just the right amount so that you can use them a few times and get the color variety without it getting all dry and clumpy.</li>
    <li> All the other colors looked good tho. I threw away the green. But can&#x27;t beat the price they are small but good for young ladies.</li>
    <li> Great quality product.  The bottles are midsized not the tiniest bon bon size you can get.  I suppose if you have very large talons they might only be good for one use.  However, I have kid-friendly nails and have used the green polish several times and still have plenty in the bottle.  You will need a base and top coat as the colors are a typical (for neon) semi matte.  I think the colors are called Neon Night Life because they are all good colors for a night at the club under the neon lights.  Not because they are all neon.  Either way, I could see the colors before I placed the order so I am very satisfied.  I got what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Some of the nail polish i received was dried out. I contacted the seller and he gave me the option to receive 25% credit.. not good enough for me so im returning it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the colors and she wears them all the time.  I liked the size of the bottles because most of time we don&#x27;t use all the polish.  Perfect for our needs.</li>
