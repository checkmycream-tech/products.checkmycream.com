      <li>so I have to make sure I moisturize right after.</li>

      <li>I originally purchased this product at the salon i go to for facials and found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>but so worth it!</li>
      <li>but I could see a significant difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Distributor should be more aware of product labeling</li>
      <li>This has a light texture and absorbs into the skin quickly and without leaving any residue.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels so light ,clean &amp; fresh on my face&amp; neck.</li>
      <li>Just purchased the full size serum after trying out the sample from the Environmental Shield Kit (also from Amazon).  </li>
      <li>Although if you want the full effect must use the rest of the Murad products.  </li>
      <li>is the full list, for your reference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Absolutely work the best product for black spot</li>
      <li>But I know the vitamin C is good for my skin, and this was recommended by an aesthetician , so I use it for long term benefits.</li>
      <li>Found it absorbed quickly into the skin after cleansing (in the morning).</li>
      <li>Smells funny and not like the original.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s well worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I have since found an equally effective Vit C for one third of the price and have switched since.</li>
      <li>Started lightening them right away.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin esp to Vitamin C products; this made my skin bright red</li>
      <li>I used it for a year and found it to be very effective in bring back life into my skin which was riddled with acne back in those days.</li>
      <li>I use it daily along with adult acne products to maintain healthy glowing break out free skin.</li>
      <li>The IPL was only 50 more dollars.  </li>
      <li>But overall my skin tone appears more even and my freckles are lighter.</li>
      <li>I am using it for the first time, so I haven&#x27;t seen and visible difference from before and after.</li>
      <li>I bought several of the Murad products including this one and they are all fantastic!  </li>
      <li>My skin has an overall healthy even toned appearance.</li>
      <li>And I was skeptical after reading some reviews, but I am very happy with the results after using the product for 1 month.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the whole Murad Essential C line.  </li>
      <li>Really good, but doesn&#x27;t last long and is rather pricey!</li>
      <li>I am not one of those women that likes to shop, so my sister was kind enough to inquire at some beauty store about the dark spots on my face (mostly scaring from picking at acne) and the fact that I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with fine lines yet, but I do think I saw a little improvement in that area, as well.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if I like it, and will get the original serum for sure.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Using this product in the morning &amp; Philosophy Miracle Worker at night has really done my face miracles.</li>
      <li>I dont know if this is a real Murad product.</li>
      <li>I did some searching and found it much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
      <li>FAST SHIPMENT AND</li>
      <li>I try not to use too much, and if I&#x27;m planning to put anything else on my face besides the moisturizer and my very light-weight / low-viscosity foundation, I skip it because everything sort of piles</li>
      <li>The spots and discoloring were no longer visible and my skin looked really good - no dark spots, uniform in color, firm and glowing.  </li>
      <li>I tried the sample of this product and liked what I tried, but when I bought the full sized bottle, it was very hard to pump the serum out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only grateful that I bought it through Amazon and didn&#x27;t&#x27; pay full price for it.  </li>
      <li>My skin was definitely more radiant and the reddish spots were less noticeable.</li>
      <li>and I have had issues with sun spots and pigmentation changes to my face - particularly after my daughter was born.  </li>
      <li>The Murad site is outrageously expensive, so I was happy to find the items on Amazon for a much cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not great results for the price</li>
    <li> Just purchased the full size serum after trying out the sample from the Environmental Shield Kit (also from Amazon).  Found it absorbed quickly into the skin after cleansing (in the morning). Believe it protects/shields the skin before applying the excellent moisturizer/sunblock (also available in the sample kit). Appears to minimize pores and does not feel heavy on the skin, really does seem to improve the clarity of the skin.</li>
    <li> does not do what the label states would not recommend only purchased once</li>
    <li> I am not one of those women that likes to shop, so my sister was kind enough to inquire at some beauty store about the dark spots on my face (mostly scaring from picking at acne) and the fact that I have extremely sensitive skin. So much so that I usually just wash my face with plain water as the majority of cleansers irritate and/or burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The store recommended the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C line. My sister gave me the starter kit for my birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but figured I would give it a try. None of the products burned or irritated my skin in the following days, so I kept using the products. In less than a week, I noticed a lot of my spots were fading and that some were completely *gone*!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband actually noticed and said that I looked like I was glowing -- his word, not mine. He then asked if I was wearing makeup, which I never wear as it irritates my skin really bad. When I told him that I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup, he actually came closer to inspect my face. He said my skin looked beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My birthday starter kit lasted about a month, and the results were so incredible that I decided to purchase the full size of each item and continue to use them. The Murad site is outrageously expensive, so I was happy to find the items on Amazon for a much cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C line to anyone with extremely sensitive skin. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I bought several of the Murad products including this one and they are all fantastic!  I have used many, many of the uber high end products out there because I am a skincare junkie and I have to say that you cannot beat this line of skincare, especially for the money.</li>
    <li> My skin loves, loves, loves this. It drinks it up. I alternate it with the Environmental Shield Essential-C Night Cream - one or the other goes on almost every night before bed. My skin has become super smooth, and makeup goes on a lot more nicely.</li>
    <li> I started to use this product in march 2013 overnight.  I seen visible results the next morning.  A brighter appearance. Pop of vitality and brightness.  It was unreal that it worked for my breakout prone skin which had a dullness and uneven tone due to past acne marks. I use it daily along with adult acne products to maintain healthy glowing break out free skin. Its working and I hope it continues to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this line of skincare. It reminds me of the Arbonne RE9 line...but at a less expensive price point.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! My skin is brighter and others have noticed. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I am buying this product because it works &amp; worth every penny.....After 2 wks of using it my crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes became less visible,the skin on my face became radiant.all my lady friends think I had done plastic surgery on my face ,jawels, &amp; under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so light ,clean &amp; fresh on my face&amp; neck.I am 71 yrs. old ,no one believes me when I tell them,so I tell them o.k. I am still 55......&lt;br /&gt;Using this product in the morning &amp; Philosophy Miracle Worker at night has really done my face miracles.I look better,feel better(younger than my age)&amp; I love the way I look,very happy &amp; will buy more if I run out.My daughter is 32 &amp; has crow feet around her lower eye area so I told her about Murad ,she is going to order some for her  own use.I also told my friend about it ,she already bought some from Amazon,she has been using it for 3 wks &amp; seen a difference in her face skin already( lots better)Thank you &amp; keep up the good work</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a bundle pack with the Clarisonic and started using it every night before going to bed. I have some acne scarring and dark spots from the sun (I&#x27;m 25 living in FL my whole life), and this really cleared it up! My skin was definitely more radiant and the reddish spots were less noticeable. I was a little sad to see how expensive the serum is, but it is definitely worth it in my opinion; I am a person that has tested a lot of products over the years, and this one really seems to do the job!</li>
    <li> I dont know if this is a real Murad product. Smells funny and not like the original.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing a whole heck of a lot of good; it&#x27;s not making my skin worse.  I use a lot of prodcts so who knows what&#x27;s doing what.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend the money again.  Maybe for someone in their 30s or 40s it would show more.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product from Sephora and I fell in love with it. I had some spots from scarring on my face and after a couple of weeks, the spots were almost gone. I wanted to keep using it, but it was quite pricey through Sephora. I did some searching and found it much cheaper on Amazon. I use it daily after washing my face and applying toner. As recommended on the bottle, I apply one pump of the product to my face and let it soak into my skin for a minute before applying moisturizer. This product is truly amazing. My skin is clearer and blemish free. I would recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> I guess it works well. I am using it for the first time, so I haven&#x27;t seen and visible difference from before and after. I say it works well because it has not deteriorated my skin condition at least.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected. I have used this product before from a retailer. Genuine!</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome and it works!! My face is brighter. I use this only in the morning and my husband asked how my face got brighter.</li>
    <li> My skin is visibly brighter and more even after a month of using this. Placebo effect? Maybe, since I am new to skin treatments,  but I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> First let me say I was thrilled to be able to get this from amazon.  I usually get it from sephora which means I also wind up buying a new lipstick and $100 of other stuff I don&#x27;t really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me say I love this serum.  After shower and before my moisturizer I use this.  I see a noticeable difference when I&#x27;m NOT using it.  My skin is duller and doesn&#x27;t absorb my moisturizer as well.  Have been using this for about three years, it&#x27;s well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I saw results within a week. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I received a small sample of this product from Murad and began using it once a day on my face.  My skin had some dark spots from acne.  The product sample lasted less than a week but I could see a significant difference in my skin.  The spots and discoloring were no longer visible and my skin looked really good - no dark spots, uniform in color, firm and glowing.  Even my husband commented that my skin was looking wonderful. I bought a larger bottle and I will continue to use this product.  What I love most about it is that it does not contain a lot of the bad ingredients that some other face creams might have, e.g. parabens and such.  I love this stuff, it is liquid gold.</li>
    <li> I am noticing a gradual difference in the dark marks on my face chest and back. My skin has an overall healthy even toned appearance. I hope with continued use and combination therapy my dark marks will fade completely. I do plan to use a cheaper vitamin C serum to see how it compares.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin esp to Vitamin C products; this made my skin bright red so I knew I had a bad reaction. I like Skin Ceuticals and Glo Proffesional Vitamin C serums. I rate the seller extremely high bc the seller refunded me immediately.</li>
    <li> I had a deluxe sample sized vial of this and I used it once daily until I ran out (about two weeks?).  In general, there was a lot to like about it, at least for me.  I feel like it helped clear up some of my breakouts and reduce some of the redness associated with them.  Some of the vitamins and plant extracts should have antioxidant activity that might help protect against sun damage.  I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with fine lines yet, but I do think I saw a little improvement in that area, as well.  This has a light texture and absorbs into the skin quickly and without leaving any residue.  I used it in the morning and followed with moisturizer, SPF, primer, and liquid foundation.  It did not interfere with the application of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list on the product page cuts off so here is the full list, for your reference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cyclopentasiloxane, Urea, Yeast Amino Acids, Trehalose, Inositol, Taurine, Betaine, Hydrolyzed Opuntia Ficus Indica Flower Extract, Hexapeptide-2, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Jojoba Esters, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract, Oat Kernel Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Oleanolic Acid, Ectoin, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Biotin, Mannitol, Zinc Gluconate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Ascorbic Acid, Chitosan, Propyl Gallate, Methyl Diisopropyl Propionamide, Ethyl Menthane Carboxamide, Menthyl Lactate, Lauryl Laurate, Hydroxyethyl Behenamidopropyl Dimonium Chloride, Ethylhexylglycerin, Silica, Xanthan Gum, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Limonene, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Orange 4 (CI 15510).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a vegan product (I know some people are concerned about such things), because it contains sodium hyaluronate (generally extracted in industry as a byproduct of poultry processing) and chitosan (extracted from shellfish exoskeletons).  I wish it did not have artificial dyes in it, though to be fair, they did not irritate my skin.  For what it&#x27;s worth, this also includes several silicones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this does have a lot of the ingredients I like in a serum -- vitamin C, tea extract, vitamin E, oat extract (this is soothing when it comes to redness), and moisturizing ingredients.  You will want to be careful when using this as the second ingredient is glycolic acid.  This is used in a lot of peels and is an alpha hydroxy acid.  It&#x27;ll make your skin look good if you have fine lines or struggle with breakouts (it helped me with both of those, that&#x27;s for sure), but should always be used in conjunction with a sunscreen.  And it can irritate some people (didn&#x27;t bother me, but your mileage may vary) so you would want to do a patch test if you have sensitive skin.ings), because it contains sodium hyaluronate (generally extracted in industry as a byproduct of poultry processing) and chitosan (extracted from shellfish exoskeletons).

    <li> This product is an amazing part of the murad line</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any change in my skin. All of my skin care products are Murad, yet this serum is just not doing anything for me. I will definitely not buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and at such a great value.</li>
    <li> caused itchiness and rash</li>
    <li> Was a very good product, would buy again. It goes on smooth and soaks into the skin immediately. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it twice daily after cleansing my face. Smells great, not perfumey or floral, more herbal like citrus sage and lavender, but very light.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the whole Murad Essential C line.  I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for about 3 months.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one that has really faded my dark pigmentation on my face. Within one week of using this product, my co-workers were asking me if I changed my makeup. It made my skin clear and glowing. I&#x27;m 56 y/o and people think I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s. Great product !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the radiance serum for 3yrs, however, I received murad active radiance serum featuring resilient c(??). Not the same, different color similar feel. I kept it. Not sure if I like it, and will get the original serum for sure. Too bad the product was not as expected and ordered.Hope it helps.</li>
    <li> Ordered twice. And the box was the eye cream, but the label the distributor put on it was the serum. Distributor should be more aware of product labeling</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got the money to replenish your supply monthly, go for it. The product is fantastic, but there&#x27;s very little in this bottle, despite appearances.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is to do, but something is happening to&lt;br /&gt;my dark spots on my face.  My face is starting to have life and&lt;br /&gt;it all due to the product of Murad.&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe that product</li>
    <li> This product is pricey (as all Murad products are). And I was skeptical after reading some reviews, but I am very happy with the results after using the product for 1 month. I haven&#x27;t seem a dramatic difference - I still have a lot of freckles and sun spots. But overall my skin tone appears more even and my freckles are lighter.</li>
    <li> Really good, but doesn&#x27;t last long and is rather pricey!</li>
    <li> Even though I am half Italian - my skin is not quite olive enough and I have had issues with sun spots and pigmentation changes to my face - particularly after my daughter was born.  I have sensitive skin and rosacea but this, the sun spot remover and the lotion in the same line has worked great to reduce the pigmentation on my cheeks from the pregnancy as well as diminish the sun spots and other changes in other locations on my face. Expensive (although Amazon tends to have the best prices) but so worth it!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I use it every morning and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in my skin ... I have lots of sun damage with &amp;#34;age spots.&amp;#34;  Started lightening them right away.</li>
    <li> Absolutely work the best product for black spot</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Gives my face a little extra radiance, and love the price from this store.</li>
    <li> I tried the sample of this product and liked what I tried, but when I bought the full sized bottle, it was very hard to pump the serum out.  Not happy with that part of it at all.  The effects were limited.  Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> When I first used this stuff at a friend&#x27;s house, I loved it.  I&#x27;ve since been using it for at least 2-3 months, most mornings as a base under the Murad SPF moisturizer, and I still use it.  I try not to use too much, and if I&#x27;m planning to put anything else on my face besides the moisturizer and my very light-weight / low-viscosity foundation, I skip it because everything sort of piles up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this ends up protecting my skin from free radicals, that will be fantastic.  But then, how can we tell whether it&#x27;s doing that job effectively in the moment?  It&#x27;s hard to rate the effectiveness of prevention</li>
    <li> Very effective product. Brightened skin and lightened freckles observed within same week of using the product once daily. Value for money to purchase the item from Amazon as compared to departmental store.</li>
    <li> I always love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for five years now.</li>
    <li> But I know the vitamin C is good for my skin, and this was recommended by an aesthetician , so I use it for long term benefits.</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer that this product was difficult to pump out.  That&#x27;s when I opened up the container and discovered there was less than a tablespoon of product.  The container clearly states it contains 1 oz.  One ounce equals two tablespoons.  I didn&#x27;t get close to that amount.  I&#x27;m only grateful that I bought it through Amazon and didn&#x27;t&#x27; pay full price for it.  I&#x27;m trying another brand of serum.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING FOR REPAIRING AND GETTING RID OF THOSE UGLY BROWN SPOTS!!!  ONLY PRODUCT I&#x27;VE EVER USED THAT HAS EVER WORKED ON HYPERPIGMENTATION AND SUN DAMAGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUPER FAST SHIPMENT AND IN PERFECT CONDITION!!</li>
    <li> This product fades my brown spots without drying.  Apply it 15-20 minutes prior to a moisturizer.  The pump bottle lasts a good two months.</li>
    <li> Worked as described! I actually saw results.</li>
    <li> Love Murad, Great price!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work and it burned me. I was not able to get my money back. It did, however, smell good.</li>
    <li> I am on my econd bottle of this product and i am liking it thus far. I have noticed a difference in the appearnce of my skin as it is brighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Guess it does not for some. I got an IPL photo facial and done. Brown spots gone.  The IPL was only 50 more dollars.  Wish I could get a refund.</li>
    <li> Meh.  Radiance shmadiance.</li>
    <li> I am 67 and LOVE Murad products.  I use all 4 steps and see definite results.</li>
    <li> Works well with my Murad line of facial regimen.  I originally purchased this product at the salon i go to for facials and found it on Amazon. Good deal!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my esthetician. I used it for a year and found it to be very effective in bring back life into my skin which was riddled with acne back in those days. It did not get rid of the acne completely but helped them go away faster making it less likely to scar. It was also 30 bucks cheaper on Amazon than it was in Sephoras. I have since found an equally effective Vit C for one third of the price and have switched since.</li>
    <li> I can recommend this product. I had some spots on my cheeks and after two weeks they all gone. I am so happy. I feel so good. I will recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it everyday twice a day. I can definitely tell a difference before I started using and afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have used this product along with other Murad products for 3 years.  It has helped change appearance on my face.  Although if you want the full effect must use the rest of the Murad products.  I have used other products from Lancome, etc those did nothing to change my sun spots on my face.  I can honestly say Murad is the best for me.</li>
    <li> Adore this serum. I had been using it for at least 6 months previously and had to stop everything in my skin care regime due to a skin allergy that broke out. I have since resolved that and have been using it again. I am once again delighted by how quickly and noticeably it changes the quality of my skin. It looks brighter and younger. It is rather pricey anywhere else besides Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but my last shipment came in what looked like a used box and the pump was broken.</li>
    <li> I love murad but I have dry skin and this product dries my skin out a little so I have to make sure I moisturize right after.</li>
