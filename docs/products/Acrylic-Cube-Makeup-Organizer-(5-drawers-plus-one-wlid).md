      <li>i get soo many compliments from everyone that sees them.</li>

      <li>Much better to buy this items vs. the ones going at $300 and up.</li>
      <li>i love them&lt;br /&gt;Fit</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I ordered the one with 5 drawers and a flip top lid.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
      <li>Beautifully made and much larger than others that were advertised for more money.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Came in excellent condition, but could see if I weren&#x27;t careful with it, it could break.</li>
      <li>Everything is organized and so easy to access.</li>
      <li>You can easily see fingerprints and dust.  </li>
      <li>Seller sent product quickly and it was in perfect condition, packaged EXTREAMLY secure in 2 boxes and bubble wrapped numerous times!</li>
      <li>This is amazing for a the first couple of months then the acrylic wears out and the drawers get stuck.</li>
      <li>but It&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
      <li>The dividers don&#x27;t fit so they just float inside.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>pricey but worth it!</li>
      <li>Yes it is totally worth the money!</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive this</li>
      <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>It does look pretty once it&#x27;s full but for the price and how cheaply it&#x27;s made, I would not recommend it.</li>
      <li>It makes getting ready easy since you can see in each drawer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m better off looking for a knockoff, which I&#x27;m most likely to find and is much, MUCH!</li>
      <li>If your willing to spend that much on a clear cube, might as well get the original one for 60 more dollars.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the splurge.</li>
      <li>so we will see if it was worth it...</li>
      <li>it was well worth the wait</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>This is a lovely looking acrylic organizer with one major flaw...</li>
      <li>I would definitely consider purchasing more items from this seller.</li>
      <li>make sure you purchase that specific one!</li>
      <li>MUCH!</li>
      <li>- It looks pretty</li>
      <li>I love this because my makeup is finally organized</li>
      <li>Girl can&#x27;t have too much make up!  </li>
      <li>It may look nice and similar to the Clear Cube</li>
      <li>I keep my brushes in the top compartment and keep it open so that my brushes are accessible while I open and close drawers.  </li>
      <li>So easy to organize and see the products I use daily!</li>
      <li>This scratch is on a solid piece of the box, so wouldn&#x27;t be an easy fix.  </li>
      <li>I wish it was a bit bigger because all my makeup won&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>Fast ship.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Delivery was on time and packed very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve wanted this drawer for 4 years it just cost to much at the time</li>
      <li>However, it is cheaply made, there is glue on some of the drawers and others are glued crooked.</li>
      <li>Even my husband loves how it looks - very sleek and modern.  </li>
      <li>I just wish the dividers were tighter and didn&#x27;t move so much.</li>
      <li>Since most people who purchase this item use it for ORGANIZING, the dividers not working completely ruins and defeats the point of this product.</li>
      <li>Better than expected!!</li>
      <li>It is extremely high quality.  </li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;ll have to order a new one.</li>
      <li>What a society we live in.</li>
      <li>For what is essentially a plastic organizer, one would think that the dividers would fit properly in the drawers.  </li>
      <li>The dividers aren&#x27;t secure enough to actually divide your makeup within each drawer.  </li>
      <li>less than the $129 this individual is asking for. :)</li>
      <li>So Far</li>
      <li>I seriously wish It was cheaper, then i&#x27;d be able to justify buying one</li>
      <li>The only flaw I see is a very small scratch in the corner of the top stationary section.  </li>
      <li>I have invested in other organizers and this one is high quality!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large and heavy and looks just like what the Kardashian&#x27;s have.  </li>

<li> there is always going to be slight marks due to manufacturing.  </li>

<li> The handles on the drawers are hard to grasp especially if you are doing a heavy makeup job and have some product on your hands.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy it myself because I thought the price was a little hefty for what is basically an acrylic box.  </li>
<li> the drawer dividers do not fit.  </li>
<li> The dividers do not fit properly...for $179...</li>
<li> Also note to buyers I was a bit unhappy with the style of my handles which is completely my fault if you&#x27;re looking for the square-ish handles</li>
<li> Not an item for people who are hard on items.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best investment ever, 3 of my friends ordered this too.</li>
    <li> This review is more based on the PRICE! than it is of the actual item. I myself have not purchased and wouldn&#x27;t even consider purchasing a make-up organizer, which will cost me 2/3 of my check. I believe the people who do purchase it probably have the money to spend or just want to keep up with the Kardashians. I still don&#x27;t see the aura these women have that so many people find charming. Ahhhhhh! What a society we live in. Well, as the seller, who am I to say its wrong, he&#x27;ll have that one person who will go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m better off looking for a knockoff, which I&#x27;m most likely to find and is much, MUCH! MUCH! less than the $129 this individual is asking for. :)</li>
    <li> I just received the 5 drawer box.  I ordered it for my daughters birthday which isn&#x27;t until May.  I titled this review So Far So Good because until I give it to her I can&#x27;t be sure if it&#x27;s perfect.  I was looking for a less expensive alternative to the box you can find online that takes 5 weeks for delivery and a manufacturer that seemed to have a better customer service reputation than that one.  I ordered the box on a Thursday and received it the following Wednesday.  It looks great, although I have nothing to compare it to.  It&#x27;s large and heavy and looks just like what the Kardashian&#x27;s have.  The only flaw I see is a very small scratch in the corner of the top stationary section.  I noticed on another review that a customer found a scratch on one of the drawers and the company replaced the drawer.  This scratch is on a solid piece of the box, so wouldn&#x27;t be an easy fix.  That said, it is very small and I think with item&#x27;s like this there is always going to be slight marks due to manufacturing.  So my 4 star instead of 5 star rating is for the scratch, otherwise I&#x27;m very happy with the item.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is a bit on the expensive side.  And yes, I did get the idea for this makeup organizer from the Kardashians.  I am so glad I spent the money and purchased this organizer over a less expensive version.  It is extremely high quality.  It arrived safely and was packaged with great care.  I ordered the one with 5 drawers and a flip top lid.  I keep my brushes in the top compartment and keep it open so that my brushes are accessible while I open and close drawers.  The bottom drawer is tall enough to keep my OPI nail polish upright, as well as some shorter foundation bottles.  I am so happy with how it looks on my bathroom counter.  Even my husband loves how it looks - very sleek and modern.  Everything is organized and so easy to access.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item. It looks great. Much better to buy this items vs. the ones going at $300 and up. The dividers do slide and don&#x27;t stay in place but it didn&#x27;t bother me. Came with lots of dividers. Came packaged nicely. Very happy, would buy again.</li>
    <li> The 2 \\&quot;dividers\\&quot; per drawer are all about 1/4 inch too short..they basically float in the drawers. That being said, it is pretty difficult to seperate anything in the same drawer. It is a very very expensive make up organizer for it not having all parts that fit properly...I will be shipping back :-(</li>
    <li> It is big .holds every make up brush ,all make up ,nail polish ,and anything you can think to put in it the dividers are great . It looks very expensive but it is not. I&#x27;ve wanted this drawer for 4 years it just cost to much at the time but amazon has it for a great price it was well worth the wait every women must have one. Even if you don&#x27;t wear makeup you can use it for anything you want to display</li>
    <li> Better than expected!!</li>
    <li> Holds all my makeup and more. Definitely worth the splurge. Product works great and was packaged nicely. Did not receive any broken pieces or scratches when opened. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> i love them&lt;br /&gt;Fit all my make up perfectly!! i get soo many compliments from everyone that sees them. they all want one now.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it! Beautifully made and much larger than others that were advertised for more money.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all it is made in America.  Delivery was on time and packed very well. However the maker did not included any information regarding the product and care. I would definitely consider purchasing more items from this seller.</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I absolutely love this product! So easy to organize and see the products I use daily! Highly recommended! Also note to buyers I was a bit unhappy with the style of my handles which is completely my fault if you&#x27;re looking for the square-ish handles make sure you purchase that specific one! Seller sent product quickly and it was in perfect condition, packaged EXTREAMLY secure in 2 boxes and bubble wrapped numerous times! A++++++</li>
    <li> I tried to find something similar in my country but nothing in term of quality ,capacity and weight..it&#x27;s quit expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail and set it up already. I love it. I wish it was a bit bigger because all my makeup won&#x27;t fit. Guess I&#x27;ll have to order a new one.</li>
    <li> pricey but worth it! bigger than i thought, but it works and looks great! i would recommend it for anybody that needs extra space!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this organizer! Well worth the money!! I use it in the bathroom for my makeup, etc and it works out perfect!</li>
    <li> It may look nice and similar to the Clear Cube but It&#x27;s cheaply made. The dividers do not fit properly...for $179...NO! Maybe even for $100..maybe...but $179? That&#x27;s ridiculous!! I seriously wish It was cheaper, then i&#x27;d be able to justify buying one</li>
    <li> This is amazing for a the first couple of months then the acrylic wears out and the drawers get stuck. I&#x27;ve bought 2 and I&#x27;m so disappointed try looking for a different material</li>
    <li> Fast ship. Lots of space. Acrylic is somewhat fragile. Not an item for people who are hard on items. Use for makeup. Really cute! Came in excellent condition, but could see if I weren&#x27;t careful with it, it could break.</li>
    <li> Great product! I just wish the dividers were tighter and didn&#x27;t move so much. It seems made verry well and it was package extremely well also. Pricey so we will see if it was worth it...so far so good.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer.  I use my on my counter in the bathroom to organize my many cosmetics!  Girl can&#x27;t have too much make up!  It makes getting ready easy since you can see in each drawer.  Saves me a lot of time!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely looking acrylic organizer with one major flaw...the drawer dividers do not fit.  For what is essentially a plastic organizer, one would think that the dividers would fit properly in the drawers.  Unfortunately, the dividers do not fit in the drawers and they do nothing to warn you about that or offer you properly fitting dividers.  Since most people who purchase this item use it for ORGANIZING, the dividers not working completely ruins and defeats the point of this product.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this for me during the holidays as per my request.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy it myself because I thought the price was a little hefty for what is basically an acrylic box.  I have the 5 drawer w/ one opening lid.  The dividers aren&#x27;t secure enough to actually divide your makeup within each drawer.  Everything moves around when you actually open the drawer.  The handles on the drawers are hard to grasp especially if you are doing a heavy makeup job and have some product on your hands. You can easily see fingerprints and dust.  Overall - It looks pretty but it&#x27;s not as practical as I thought and certainly not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this and it didn&#x27;t take long at all. However, it is cheaply made, there is glue on some of the drawers and others are glued crooked. The dividers don&#x27;t fit so they just float inside. It does look pretty once it&#x27;s full but for the price and how cheaply it&#x27;s made, I would not recommend it. If your willing to spend that much on a clear cube, might as well get the original one for 60 more dollars.</li>
    <li> I love this because my makeup is finally organized and I can see everything neatly displayed! Yes it is totally worth the money! I have invested in other organizers and this one is high quality!</li>
