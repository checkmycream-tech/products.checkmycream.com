      <li>It is great for healing bruises quickly and recovering from muscle and tissue soreness.</li>
      <li>It is odorless, and makes it very easy to put on a compression sock after use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the syrup doesn&#x27;t taste like candy, but probably tastes better than the massage oil! :</li>
      <li>At 46 years old, 6 ft 1&amp;#34; and 225 lbs I&#x27;ve got to keep my muscles, joints and tissues at its best.  </li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t had time to really use it very much (results,etc)  </li>
      <li>Really helps out.</li>
      <li>It is a dark oil, so I apply it after I&#x27;ve showered and again right before bed and have not had any problems with staining; I simply massage the oil into the skin until it is absorbed.</li>
      <li>For as much as we used it we still have a lot left.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works to relieve aches and pains locally.</li>
      <li>I started using Dr. Christophers Tissue &amp; Bone salve and the Complete Tissue &amp; Bone Oil, alternating throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Why does my review end up in both the complete bone and tissue MASSAGE OIL product and the complete bone and tissue SYRUP???  </li>
      <li>so put on old socks over it.</li>
      <li>Slightly stains (mildly),</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles so far to have convenient in other areas of the house but am still using the first, so it goes a long way.</li>

    <li> Recently had a partial knee replacement.  When the staples were removed the doctor put glue and steri-strips on the the wound.  After they came off the scar was tight and pulled.  I started using Dr. Christophers Tissue &amp; Bone salve and the Complete Tissue &amp; Bone Oil, alternating throughout the day.  You massage it into the scar to break up any scar tissue.  It is an excellent product and I am so grateful to have found it.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Not that great Blue Emu works much better</li>
    <li> My entire family uses this for bumps and bruises and it works great! For as much as we used it we still have a lot left. Great price, great product and we will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful healing oil!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products are always top shelf.....have used many for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil helps me a great deal with knee pain and enables me to walk easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this oil!</li>
    <li> Really helps out. Have a number of tendon problem areas and I notice a difference, seems to work even better when I use a far infrared lamp with it. Although the directions say to use 6x a day I use twice.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product. Oil massages right into the skin and leaves no scent.  It is a dark oil, so I apply it after I&#x27;ve showered and again right before bed and have not had any problems with staining; I simply massage the oil into the skin until it is absorbed. I&#x27;ve used it for my sciatica and tight  &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34; band issues and find it gives me relief. My daughter has severe neck pain from degenerative disk disease and has also found relief using this product. I will definitively purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I use many of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s oils and salves.  They are wonderful and have helped heal many of the issues I live with.</li>
    <li> I got this to massage my ankle after a joint fusion. It is odorless, and makes it very easy to put on a compression sock after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in conjunction with capsules to heal torn ligaments in knee.  Seems to be working and was recommended by my Chiropractor.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had time to really use it very much (results,etc)  It came highly recommended to me as a effective treatment for arthritis.</li>
    <li> Using it on a cracked bone, and messed up tendons. Started 5 times a day, and now weeks later, down to one to two times a day. Slightly stains (mildly), so put on old socks over it. Feels great on the injury, and I really do think it&#x27;s helping speed up the healing process. Barely a scent to it; and what I can smell isn&#x27;t that bad. Thanks Dr. C for another great product!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I think these products are great.</li>
    <li> At 46 years old, 6 ft 1&amp;#34; and 225 lbs I&#x27;ve got to keep my muscles, joints and tissues at its best.  Dr. Christophers complete tissue and bone massage oil takes great care of my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about one year.  Helps repair tissue.  My knee that needed a replacement is now pain free.</li>
    <li> NOT GOOD AT ALL!  Would not recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Nothing works to heal bone and tissue like Dr. Christophers B&amp;T and it relieves the pain too!</li>
    <li> Why does my review end up in both the complete bone and tissue MASSAGE OIL product and the complete bone and tissue SYRUP???  They are 2 different products!  I&#x27;ve never used the syrup, but I love the massage oil.  The syrup is what you are supposed to take internally. Is this product labeled wrong here? I have used the massage oil for a long time, but only as directed, which is topically, as massage oil. I&#x27;m sure the syrup doesn&#x27;t taste like candy, but probably tastes better than the massage oil! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the massage oil, it has helped aid in the healing of many injuries in my family.  You just have to apply it throughout the day (often) if you are looking for faster results.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped and received quickly. Even better were their pricing.</li>
    <li> This is excellent and does exactly what it says it does. It is great for healing bruises quickly and recovering from muscle and tissue soreness.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works to relieve aches and pains locally. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This is unusual oil in that absorbs better than any oil I&#x27;ve used and my skin feels good from it.  It does help relieve discomfort.  I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles so far to have convenient in other areas of the house but am still using the first, so it goes a long way.</li>
