<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pulled skin off my lip...disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Does the job. If using on your face, it takes several weeks to get use to the pain during use.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have chin hair I am tired of tweezing. This was rated well on the reviews. The only bad thing is it didn&#x27;t come with instructions. I am not sure if you have to let the hair get real long first or if there is a certain way to hold the Emjoi. It does take the hair off because I can see it on the Emjoi, but I still see it on my chin too.</li>
    <li> LOVE this!!!!! Works great and I love the small size.</li>
    <li> at first i didn&#x27;t quite read the instruction and pressed the remover onto my skin and got painful bumps.&lt;br /&gt;but after i learned that i don&#x27;t actually have to press onto my skin&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s works great&lt;br /&gt;no pain and it&#x27;s really help with ingrown hair</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to use. Made for small areas. Good &amp;#34;first&amp;#34; hair remover to try. The product price is economical.</li>
    <li> this thing is awful!! I wish I never would have spent the money on it! it pinches your skin even when you pull it tight. it hurts like heck and it sucks! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I had seen these type of hair removers advertised on TV. I checked Amazon and found this for less money. I am well pleased with it glad I can put away tweezers and a magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> this little epilator works really well for the facial area which is all I really got it for, I had an old Emjoi model which didn&#x27;t seem very effective any longer,really glad I found this. Good price,quick delivery,good deal!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what I bought it for, would not recommend it. Would return it, but it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> this was my first epilator and yes it hurt but that&#x27;s not why i don&#x27;t like it. i used it on my legs and it didn&#x27;t pull out all the hairs from the root so i was left with quite a bit of stubble. also, it would take FOREVER to pull out some hairs (multiple passes were needed). and lastly, maybe this applies to all epilators but i used this on my armpits and i got A LOT of ingrown hairs afterwards (when i shaved i would rarely get one or two but everytime i epilate i would get multiple ingrown hairs)and now it looks unsightly :(</li>
    <li> It hurts when the hair is being pulled out, but it does a great job.  Absolutely a great product. I&#x27;m buying another one for my niece</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bikini area. Yes, it hurts -- a lot-- the first time you use it. I had to do some, walk away, come back... did it in tiny sections. However, after the first time, my skin has acclimated really well (like plucking your eyebrows, that hurts like the dickens the first time too), and I can use it with no issues at all. I tried my legs, but just don&#x27;t have the patience to do the whole area, I think I&#x27;d buy a larger Epi product for that. Same with pits. You do have to let the hair grow out slightly for it to grab, and sometimes I just can&#x27;t get some strays and need to use a tweezers, but I love this thing and wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> Every time a friend tries mine out they end up taking it because they fall in love with it!  I have bought the bigger one, but not been as impressed.  This one is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I have really dark coarse hair on my upper lip and have been a regular waxer. Wanted an at-home alternative as the weekly need for salon visits was annoying. This didn&#x27;t hurt at all on my upper lip and chin area and did a great job with getting rid off the hairs. It&#x27;s easy to carry in your kit. Just ordered another one for my dear sister.</li>
    <li> Ladies... You have got to try this... I use to spend hours pucking and pulling, embrassing facial hair. not anymore.. This is the best thing I have ever run across. It is  so easy light weight, I carry it in my purse everywhere. I&#x27;m gonna buy these for Christmas gifts!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Thank you! Small enough to take in my makeup bag.  Not for use on large areas like legs (would take too long) but perfect for bikini line, tummy, toes, and underarms.  Has been safe for me to use in sensitive areas, something I was concerned about.  One thing to note- there is no place for the hair to go once its been removed, so I found it much cleaner to do in an area that could easily be cleaned up, like the bathroom.  Also, I found that the hair lifted easier right after a shower, maybe b/c pores were opened.  Lastly, I sprayed the &#x27;blade&#x27; area with rubbing alcohol (just the tips of the &#x27;blade&#x27;, i don&#x27;t mean soak the whole thing).  I found that this killed bacteria that would make my skin sting after a use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim after I decided not to purchase a No!No! since the Emoji was well reviewed and very cheap. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting all that much as I had purchased a similar epilator a few years back that did nothing more than painfully tug at a few hairs. I previously had been plucking hairs with a tweezer which, while effective, was terribly time consuming. While this didn&#x27;t get the job done in a minute, it was a heck of a lot more efficient than doing it by hand, and managed to pull out both the thicker and the fine fuzz (which I found almost impossible to deal with only the tweezers) out by the root. It&#x27;s not painless, but it&#x27;s definitely tolerable, especially when using it in a circular motion. People also complained that it&#x27;s rather loud, it&#x27;s also not exactly like a jet engine taking off in the bathroom either, and from my experience, that just seems to be the case for epliators. I&#x27;m now in the market for a larger one for the rest of my fuzz. Wish I had found this sooner! Totally recommended, and at less than $13, you really don&#x27;t have much to lose!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love love LOVE! this product, I am so glad i purchase this, i&#x27;m planning to get another one! :]</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what an epilator was until I found them on Amazon.com. I researched them a little and then decided on this one because of the price. I figured if it didn&#x27;t work or hurt too much, at least I didn&#x27;t blow my money on an expensive one. I do love it and will eventually upgrade to a nicer, bigger one. The small size is perfect if you only want to use it on your arm pits or bikini area. I use mine on my legs because I have not mustered up the courage to use it anywhere else. With that said, it does hurt. This is coming from someone who has tattoos and delivered a 9 pound baby without shedding a tear. However, I am someone who believes that beauty is pain. If you want to be hair-free for one or two weeks (without having to shave) then you&#x27;re either going to have to epilate, wax or use a laser. Epilating is cheapest. It&#x27;s worth a try.     (Side note - if you are looking to remove facial hair, I would buy the REM spring. I own one and it is much gentler than an actual epilator. It is just a tiny spring that works by catching small, fine hairs in its coil and pulling them out at the root. No batteries needed and practically painless. I would never use my epilator on my face because it does leave a rash for several hours. Too harsh for that area.)</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews, and... hey, they were right!  It really does work!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Granted, it works for certain areas on me without a topical - namely, my underarms.  It&#x27;s an excellent pit defoliation device!  Take a hot shower, dry off, and apply, and it doesn&#x27;t even hurt.  I absolutely love being able to wear tank tops without worrying about 5oclock shadow showing up at 9am.&lt;br /&gt;It also worked well on my chin, my arms, my eyebrows, and certain bikini areas, all without any topical anesthetic, just heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However (and this may just be me) I wouldn&#x27;t use it on other areas without a 6% lidocaine solution or HIGHER.  Ow, ow, ow, @#*&amp;%_ OW.  These areas include, shockingly, my upper lip.  I applied a 4% lidocaine solution and let it soak in, and nope, still hurt too much to use an epilator - and I can wax my upper lip hot or cold without issue.&lt;br /&gt;Bikini line - Give me good pain killers, please.  OW OW OW OW OW OW.  I have thick black hair with very stubborn roots, and this was not a good combination even just after applying heat.&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrows: works great, just watch what the heck you&#x27;re doing or you won&#x27;t have any brows left to speak of.  If your hand shakes, don&#x27;t chance it.  Stick with the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, true to form, I can&#x27;t use it on my legs.  No waxing or epilating down there for me, no matter the circumstancs.  I&#x27;ll stick with my razor, but hey, shaving *just* my legs is great compared to EVERYTHING ELSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this little doohicky a shot - it&#x27;s worth the $13 bucks!  (And battery life is good, too!)</li>
    <li> I expected pain. I bought it for my underarms. I am lucky to not have that much hair. But I was feed up with the itch after shaving.  So I have owned it for three months now and has worked great. As I said the hair on my legs is fine so I can get away without shaving or waxing but with this little thing I go ahead and also use it on my legs. Years ago a had an epilady but that was painful.</li>
    <li> this is the first time i try using an epilator, it was quite scary at my first use, but i am getting used to it now :)  it works fine for my underarm but it not really good at removing real short hair. i tried once on my bikini but ouch, it&#x27;s so painful and now i just use it for my underarm &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I tried this on my face and it really hurt especially on the lip and after a day I already had stubble which means is pulled but just ripped at the skin instead of my hair being pulled out by the root. a lot of pain for one hairless day and that whole day I am red anyway. not really worth the pain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair as well as some of the other better brands but it does remove hair. It will just take longer and you&#x27;ll have to be patient and go over each area multiple times. It took me two days to treat one area, first day I got a lot of hair but became sore, waited until the next day and finished the residual hairs. Also, it has a tendency to break hairs instead of pulling them out by the root. Overall I&#x27;d recommend this as a back up, like for traveling or touching up, etc... but not for a first time user.</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy one. Great product and price for beginners. Left a tiny bit of redness but faded in an hour or so, just use at night if your worried. Perfect for course hair on the chin, neck, and side of face or anywhere. Facial hair can really do terrible things to a womans self image and thanks to this my confidence is returning.</li>
    <li> Okay, I absolutely HATE this thing.  I have PCOS and was hoping it would help with my unfortunate chin stubble.  Not only does it HURT like a SOB and feels like I&#x27;m being sliced open by razor blades while I&#x27;m Epi-ing, but it left me with a HORRIBLE breakout.  I took pics and will try to load.  I have very dry skin so have never really had problems with acne - until I used this product.  Partially my own fault though so please read and take heed - if you purchase and use this, be sure to put a COLD damp cloth on your face afterwards to close up all the pores that you just ripped hair follicles out of BEFORE you put on any lotion or makeup.  I mistakenly used both after using this and all the gunk filled my pores and broke me out something wicked.  I probably have 30+ pimples on my chin alone...all tiny ones and right next to each other so it looks like a huge strawberry on my chin.  I do not like this product at all.  I&#x27;ll just keep shaving every other day...  :-(</li>
    <li> I tried to use it for bikini area, and ouch!!! SOB... Maybe it works better on other area. But I had to return it since it doen&#x27;t work for what I wanted for.</li>
    <li> There were just enough semi-positive reviews for this that I broke down and purchased one. Don&#x27;t do it! Total waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t even the touch coarser hairs and breaks the others. Tweezing or waxing is much better. As others have mentioned, it is really noisy too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got coarse black hair and I&#x27;m peri-menopausal and hair is showing up places I didn&#x27;t think could grow! This Epi Slim works wonders. Yes, it will hurt a little, but it&#x27;s worth it. Be very careful around your eyebrows! While it&#x27;s great for those minute white hairs you can&#x27;t see just be careful that you don&#x27;t let it grab hairs that you want to shape your brows. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Summer was usually a tough time for me because I constantly had to hide my legs from sight. I have super sensitive skin that becomes red, bumpy, and full of ingrown hairs whenever I shave. Even if I waited for the redness and bumps to fade, the hair would be growing back already. Veet and Nair couldn&#x27;t do anything for my thick hair, only burned my skin, so I felt totally helpless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about whether or not I wanted to buy this device to pluck all my hair out, but the price wasn&#x27;t too bad of a risk (a whole lot cheaper than waxing or lazer treatment!) and the reviews are encouraging. After a speedy delivery, I tried it out on the top of my thigh, where its less sensitive. Piece. Of. Cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got to plucking the hairs out on my shin area, I just took a pain killer and cranked up my tunes. Was really easy and completely worth it. I missed a couple hairs because they weren&#x27;t long enough to catch, so I waited a week and got the rest. Didn&#x27;t need another pain killer or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes me about 3 hours to remove all the hair on my legs, but that&#x27;s just because there&#x27;s one or two discs working at a time, which in my opinion, is the way to go for a first-time user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product is gold. It saved me from ugly bumps on my skin and has boosted my confidence all the more. If you have similar problems with shaving, you MUST MUST MUST get one of these. Its so nice not having to worry about if your legs look gross or if your hair has already started growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer is going to be so much more fun and care-free now~</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this item.  I used to wax my upper lip and my side burns until I decided to start lazer (laser hair removal has got to be one of the worst ways I have ever spent my money.  Not only the hair came back after 6 treatments but it left my skin stained).  When I got the epilador in the mail I wanted to use it as soon as possible so I started the epilator and I was horrified at how fast the tweezers work but when I finally had the guts to try it, it was not as bad as it looks.  It works well, it does not get all the hairs but it gets enough that you really cannot tell you have any hair.</li>
    <li> I got my very first Epilator yesterday.  I could not wait to use it.  Oh Boy, but when I did.....I Thought I was going to drop that one tear Like Denzel did in \\&quot;Glory.\\&quot;  I got thru it, and so will you guys.  I am reading other reviews to get tips on helping with the pain. Someone said baby powder helps, another said a fresh shower,,,,,,,that didn&#x27;t work for me.  Overall, it is a great product.  My under arms are vey smooth!!!</li>
    <li> Does not work on me at all</li>
    <li> I initially bought two of these: one for my face and one for my underarms.  I was a little concerned because this took a battery, however the battery last really long, so you don&#x27;t need to go through a lot.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First the face:  I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working on the very fine hair on my face because I have noticed that sometimes this just cuts the hair rather then pull it out (too thin to grab?).  It&#x27;s a little sore to use on sensitive places like the face, but still much more comfortable then wax or other epilators I have tried.  Because it does sting a little, I am assuming that it is pulling the hair out, but the hairs are too fine to actually see if it got the bulb/root and all.  Also, some of the hair seems to be back within days so I know those are the ones that have only been cut.  But majority of my face stays hair free for weeks!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the underarms:  Works WONDERFULLY!!  Because the hair under the arm is a little thicker, the Epi Slim Compact Epilator actually grabs it much easier and I find it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, rather it&#x27;s just a slight &#x27;tug&#x27;.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about my underarms at all for at least a week!  And all the red bumps and razor burn have gone away so I am left with only smooth underarms!  I love it for this reason!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having waxing for removal of facial hair and this is much better and I can do it myself.  The directions are easy to follow and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  It will pay for itself as I no longer have to pay for waxing.  The older I get, the less hair I have on my legs and more on my face.  This helps me to feel more confident without wondering if someone can see the ugly facial hairs. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I very much like the slimness of the eplilator.  I just wished there was some way to do this without the pain.  I do not seem to be able to hold my skin taut enough as I do it.  I have a large epilator for my legs and I have the same challenge.  I even have the epilady and it was worse so some improvement has been made.  I find myself putting off using it because of the fast movement of the product.  I admit I need to practice more with it and learn how to use it comfortably.</li>
    <li> I feel like I wasted my money on this one.  It does not remove enough hair to be noticeable and is pretty darn painful, so you cannot use it in the same area for very long.  I followed all instructions, but still feel disappointed.</li>
    <li> perfectly portable &amp; great for touch ups too.  I used this on my under arms - my first try of epilation - and it did not hurt at all.  My skin is smoother now than it ever was shaving &amp; I haven&#x27;t had to use the epilator again yet &amp; it&#x27;s been a week.  So much better than shaving; this is the best new thing I&#x27;ve tried in a very long time!  Definitely worth the $20ish to try it!!</li>
    <li> Who woulda thunk I&#x27;d turn into a KITTY as life got better and better.  This yanks out some of the annoying reminders. meow</li>
    <li> I got this for facial hair. It works just fine as long as you follow the directions precisely. You hold the head flat against the skin. Imagine a roller ball on deodorant.  Hold the skin taut. Go in circles. The vibration startles and the hair removal feels like a little tug. I&#x27;m pleased. It is hard to go in circles on the point of the chin.  I don&#x27;t know how it would work on underarms or legs. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I would have a couple of stiff hairs poking out on my chin. I could feel them. But I couldn&#x27;t see them. I would pluck and pluck until by luck ....</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the underarms,and it works WONDERFULLY!!! I cut hair under the arm short first, then use this epilator to pull the hair out which makes the epilator grab hair much easier and I&#x27;m glad that it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought it for the face. I have light skin, not sensitiv with light hair and a few dark coarse hairs at the chin. The emjoi AP-9L gave me the worst rash of my life. I did not left the house for a week, because I could not even cover my rash with make up.     The machine is worling well and might be a good travel size epilator. But if you are thinking about getting this one just for the face, don´t buy !</li>
    <li> I own the Braun Silk-epil Expressive Epilator and I&#x27;m happy with it. But, I wanted a small one for more delicate areas (i.e. under arms &amp; bikini). Unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t remove a thing. The tweezer head is curved (vs. straight across) and unless you have long hairs to pluck, this won&#x27;t do a thing for you. I&#x27;m familiar with epilating and tried every which way to get it to work, but to no avail. I printed out my return label &amp; I&#x27;m heading to the post office today.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator for about 20 dollars. I can honestly say that I haven&#x27;t had to use a razor ever since I got it. Although sometimes I have to go over the same area with the epilator to pick up stray hairs, the hair comes back thinner and much slower so it&#x27;s worth the time. Epilating is also not as painful as tweezing individually or shaving nicks. I recommend this product for areas such as the underarms, face, and arms but not so much for legs.</li>
    <li> Great little item.  My cousin told me about this when I was  complaining about \\&quot;stiff hairs on my chin\\&quot;.  This is really  handy.  Very convenient size.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after some hestation due to the mixed reviews it has gotten.  I have tried a more expensive brand ($100+) and although it worked well, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the investment.  This much more affordable version is spectacular.  The only potential drawback is that it&#x27;s fairly small.  Even so, I was able to do my underarms in a matter of minutes and both legs took less than 10 minutes.  I&#x27;ve even used it on my bikini line and the small size works really well for this area.  I usually wax, so it is much quicker and easier with virtually no mess.  The noise is the same as any other brand so if you&#x27;re trying to hide the fact that you use hair removal products from people you live with, these are not for you.  Also, if waxing is painful for you, this will be about the same.  Overall, I really like this product and would definitely recommend it over waxing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for all of my hair removal needs since I got it several months ago and have no complaints.  The size and ease of use also make it great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Just received my Epi slim,I was anxious to use it,with all the moneys I have spent on hair removal,waxing,razors and messy cremes,this product finally answered my prayers.It was very simple to use, my legs were done in no time,didn&#x27;t hurt a bit,but i am used to waxing, which is PAINFUL.I am soooo pleased to find a product that does what it is supposed to do,will be using in other areas once I become more skilled at using it,I am sure it will be just as effective on my underarms and bikini area,thanks so much for making this available to me and others with the same problems,it has already paid for itself,sincerely,one happy customer:)</li>
    <li> Pulls the hair terribly .. I&#x27;d rather wax!</li>
    <li> I have had pretty dark hair above my upper lip for the longest time and was always self conscious about it. I finally decided I had had enough of it and bought this epilator to try. I have never waxed or epilated before....the extent of my torture was tweezing my eyebrows. So about a week before actually using the epilator I would tweeze a few haris out of my upper lip just so I got used to the feeling as after some of the horror stories about the pain, I was worried. Granted, I have a high pain tolerance, but the epilator really didn&#x27;t hurt all that much. Definitely worth it for the outcome! One thing to note is that the middle of the upper lip area under the nose is the worst! After epilating there were a few hairs that it missed so I hand tweezed those. I immediately put moisturizer on the area and put some ice for about a minute as it was pretty red. After I took the ice off I put more moisturizer and went to bed. Got up this morning (did it last night) my upper lip area looks amazing! All the redness was gone and it was hair-free :)</li>
    <li> the first time I used it underarms, HOLY COW it hurt like hell, i was all tearing up and stuff. and some of the pores (after the hair was removed) was reddish and bleeding-ish, which was really scary. but overall i like this product, it removes hair thoroughly, much better than shaving and more efficient than waxing.</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well on the facial area.  It is gentle to the skin, gets all the unwanted hair quickly with just a couple of pass-overs.  The hair stays gone much longer than with previous products I&#x27;ve used.  I highly recommend this product to any woman with unwanted facial hair.  It is quick and easy to use and it is great on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is only the second epi hair remover I&#x27;ve owned, so I can only compare this one to my old epilady that I used 10+ years ago. The difference is substantial though. Does it hurt? Of course. But it&#x27;s much faster and works better than the previous one, so it&#x27;s over much more quickly. You will become less sensitive to the pain over time, but it never goes away completely. I recommend it over tweezing and waxing because it&#x27;s less costly than waxing and more efficient than either. I only use this on my face, so I don&#x27;t know how well it works for legs and bikini areas. But for legs, it might be too small. Also, I would not recommend this for use below the brow line because the surface is not flat or smooth enough and the potential for accidentally pulling too many brow hairs out is too great to be worth the risk. Another note: I&#x27;ve used mine weekly for the past nine months and it still works like new and I&#x27;ve only gone through two sets of batteries.</li>
    <li> I like it - it works!  Takes a bit of time per session, but overall - IT WORKS! Hair takes a long time to regrow. I use it on my lower legs and my face. (I&#x27;m F over 50)</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend, as she was very interested in it since it is a popular product in Korea.    These cosmetic hair removers are an effective way to pull out hair without using wax. This saves you time from having to constantly shave.  The product has worked very well for her and will last a while.  They also offer some sort of ointment that you can use with it, but as long as you aren&#x27;t using this product on sensitive areas or sensitive skin, you might not need the ointment.</li>
    <li> ok, doesn&#x27;t really get fine hair and the stinging takes a few tries to get used to.</li>
    <li> It took a few times to get used to and learn what angles removes the hair best, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and it&#x27;s a little life changer! I only use it for my underarms so it&#x27;s the perfect size. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year and still going strong, gets rid of those annoying chin hairs that appear overnight</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use the epilator! I used it and was happy with how much fuzz it pulled of my face. But by the next morning I had a terrible rash and ingrown hairs all over my cheeks, neck, upper lip and chin had already started. I used it after getting out of the shower hoping ingrown hairs would not happen. This product did not work for me at all. I&#x27;m very dissapointed. I think if you have sensitive facial skin I don&#x27;t recommend using this. I have still not found anything that works for me other than a tweezer. Which a tweezer can not keep up with all the fuzz I have on my face!</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest epilator I&#x27;ve seen on the market, mostly because it is a travel size. I purchased this for my armpit hair, which are dark and a little long. On the instructions it says to cut your hair to less than 5mm, which is a little difficult for the armpit area in my opinion. The pores where my underarm hairs were pulled from were actually filled with blood afterward; not enough to ooze out, but you could definitely see it. Kind of scary, but it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected, since I tried this straight out of the shower. Will update when I use this longer&lt;br /&gt;As I wrote in the title, it doesn&#x27;t pick up shorter hairs or really fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;For people who&#x27;re using this for facial hair, I recommend using Sally Hansen&#x27;s facial bleach, it works fairly well for upper lips but could irritate your skin a bit.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for 3 years and I was buying a second one as a gift. great model.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Epi Slim in order to remove the hair under my arms as shaving caused dark shadows, waxing hurt and irritated the area, and creams didn&#x27;t work.    It took about five days to arrive, which was fine as I selected the 3-5 day option. I was really excited to try it out; given that shaving was my primary method of hair removal, and given that it causes dark shadows, I have been very embarrassed about wearing sleeveless shirts and dresses. The device was in good condition when it arrived, and all it took to get it started was inserting two AA batteries into the easily accessible battery case and switching it to the &#x27;on&#x27; position.    My hair had grown out for about two days prior to use. I soaked a clean white cotton towel in hot water, then applied to my underarm for about thirty seconds. My underarms were clean of any deodorant, lotion, etc. I used the Epi Slim in short strokes to begin with, and in small circles later. It did hurt, but not excessively. Much much much better than waxing. I kept reapplying warm water onto my skin throughout the process.    I got my left arm pit almost completely done and only managed a small part of my right arm pit before I ended for the day. The stinging pain (very light, not sore) ceased within five minutes of stopping. The redness went away within an hour. I came back the next day and finished up using the same method and with the same result except that it hurt less to do my left armpit.    I immediately noticed the shadow I&#x27;ve been so ashamed of is no longer there. I am immensely happy with this outcome. However, there is still some hair that was missed. It is not viewable unless someone has their head right up close, though, and I imagine I&#x27;ll be able to get rid of it as soon as it grows out a teensy bit. It also took a while to complete the process (each day). That might be because it was the first epillation, though, or because my hair is freaky weird growing in all different directions.      ---    I did try this onmy bikini lines. It hurt so much that I ceased almost immediately. Again, I&#x27;m a total wimp so maybe it&#x27;ll be fine for others. But, for the underarms, it is completely tolerable.      I hope this was helpful. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is my second one. I ordered my first one from QVC, and it ran for a little over a year. Not as painful as you might expect but it&#x27;s fast and efficient. Faster and cheaper than waxing, and you can do it in the privacy of your own home without sitting in a salon for the whole world to watch. Great size to carry in your purse for touch-ups on the go.  The batteries seemed to last forever and actually held up longer than the device itself. You do have to make sure to keep it clean or it won&#x27;t perform as well. Overall it&#x27;s a great little device. I just wish they could improve the quality a little so it would last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this little product! I was nervous about purchasing it because of some of the reviews and I HATE pain. I have been waxing for at least ten years so the only thing i felt was a little prickle. The areas where I have not waxed were a lot more difficult. If you do not wax then this will probably hurt.&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I love it. I can&#x27;t remember the last time my chin was this smooth. all the hairs on my lip are gone and no mustache under the make-up. I love that you don&#x27;t have to wait until the hairs are long and ugly...zap and they are gone. I can go out in public with confidence without being self-conscience about my facial hair. Great for travel too!! Thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> Throw away your tweezers ladies .  This is great , quick , and lasts soooooooooooo long.</li>
    <li> I bought this Epi Slim hair remover Dec 2010 and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  After using it several times I began to notice less hair growing.  The hair still grew but I noticed less and less growth.  Had I used it consistantly right after I bought it Dec 2010, I think in 2 months or less I would have seen less hair sooner than the 6 months since I bought it.  I use this mainly under my chin and near lips. It really works!</li>
    <li> When I realized it was taking over an hour to tweeze my upper lip I realized there had to be a better way. I can&#x27;t afford that kind of time for grooming, there&#x27;s a great life to live! An internet search revealed to me the world of epilators.    I bought this unit for my upper lip, then used it on the lip, between my brows and between my brow and hairline. It&#x27;s fast, effective and totally not scary. Right under my nose I have never tweezed because it hurts too much with a tweezer, and it hurt just as bad with this epilator, but by the time I wanted to stop (right away) it was over and the hair was out. Awesome tool.     As far as not having a \\&quot;safety\\&quot; it really doesn&#x27;t need one. Just glide it gently over your skin and it will do it&#x27;s work and you will be a-okay! Trust me, if it was going to pinch someone, I would have been that person, since I was going after every stubborn hair :) (Just like with shaving, you may have to work it in a few directions to get all the hair - think about the design - it&#x27;s a bunch of tweezers all pulling and hoping to find a hair. Help it find the hair.)      To give you a picture of how this thing does it&#x27;s job: it&#x27;s a roller with metal pieces that come together and pull apart, like that fish game with the fish that opens and closes it&#x27;s mouth. As the roller spins around the metal opens and closes, I think you could get a tiny floppy skin tag pinched, but not normal flesh, it just doesn&#x27;t open far enough for that.</li>
    <li> OMG-this thing is great! I knew I had hair on my face but had no idea how much until I used this. It really works and does not hurt as bad as I thought it would, more a prickly sensation rather than outright pain. It did irritate my face a bit, I probably would not use it right before I had to go out for the day because of the redness, but it is much easier than waxing, and much more affordable too. Love it!</li>
    <li> Product does exactly what it is supposed to do. I bought it because my epilady facial epilator had died. This one is much more affordable and more effective.</li>
    <li> It takes 20 minutes to compete a small area.  Feel like I wasted my money. I am going to check in to return inning this it item</li>
    <li> I was a little sceptical about this product because of the inexpensive cost.  However, I cannot say enough good about this hair remover.  I had another facial hair remover from Braun that didn&#x27;t work very well at all and took 4 AAA batteries that hardly lasted any time at all.  This product takes two AA batteries that I have used every day since it arrived at least two weeks ago and they are still going strong.  This remover works GREAT.  It removes hair that are just barely above the skin.  You can hardly feel anything.  Around the top of the lip is the most sensitive, but still just barely a tingle. I have also checked on and bought a facial hair remover cream.  Even though it is relatively cheap, still for a small tube, it would take quite a lot to do your whole face and it still only removes at the skin, where this product removes it below the skin.  I would still have to use the hair remover cream, probably every day or two, and I&#x27;m not sure my sensitive skin would allow me to use it that much.  I have had no lumps, bumps or rashes with this epi hair remover.  I have fair, sensitive skin and am a redhead.  I just hate feeling the smallest hair stub, and this product removes even those very easily.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product over any other.  As you can tell, I love it.</li>
    <li> This little device is a time-saver. It hurts like hell to use but that&#x27;s expected of any device that grips and pulls our hair out and it&#x27;s the price we ladies have to pay to look good. It&#x27;s a tad bit noisy but other than that, pretty much exactly what I was looking for and at an amazing price point. I&#x27;ve owned this device for over 6 months and use it regularly - mostly for minor spot hair removals. Not sure if it would be able to handle larger jobs as it does not cover that much surface area.  It appears to be of decent build and durability and I have not had to replace the batteries yet. I would highly recommend for minor, small scale hair removal jobs.</li>
    <li> I used it but never again it was way too painful the way it rips the hair from your skin, I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and never again.</li>
    <li> Was worried that this wouldn&#x27;t work for me as I mostly need it for my face, but wow! I&#x27;m impressed. I was also worried I may have to let my goatee grow out a bit before I could effectively grab it to remove it, but I initially used this about twice a week, and now once every week and a half works. The hair seems to grown in softer and lighter as well. It&#x27;s normally very prickly and coarse. I did get a bit overzealous the first time I used it and had it directly on my throat area for a little too long and it burned me a bit, but it was a quick lesson in how to properly use it. I&#x27;m a dark skinned woman in her 30&#x27;s and have had facial hair growth for as long as I can remember. Daily shaving was just a bummer along with the razor bumps that came with it, nearly a year or laser hair removal treatments were completely ineffective, and this has been the only thing to leave my face completely smooth. So happy with this!!</li>
    <li> I tested it out on my under arms, which mind you I have never waxed. It was gentle, mind you that does not mean it won&#x27;t hurt. I also tested it on  my leg where i have waxed before and it was much gentler than waxing.  Yes, because it is small and has only one roller head you will have to go over an area multiple times. I am researching a larger head model to tackle my gorilla legs.  This is great for delicate and small areas. Though I did use it on my leg, took forever (again it is meant for small areas).</li>
    <li> I have used the Emjoi for two months before posting a review because I had my doubts that such a modestly-priced epilator would live up to its purpose. But, I&#x27;m happy to report: It works! At first, I suspected that the rotating heads were just breaking the hair at the surface, but when I cleaned it, I could see the hair roots. Further proof of its tweezing function is that there is no stubble, just smooth skin, even days later. If you are used to tweezing, the Emjoi is virtually painless, although the first time can be a bit uncomfortable. I have not experienced any skin irritation. The Emjoi is definitely designed for small delicate areas and I use it only on my neck and face. And, as with all epilators, the longer you use it, the thinner the hair growth. Cleaning the heads is quick and simple, just use the provided brush to dust the hair away.</li>
    <li> Well, I had read other reviews on this product before I purchased.  I have coarse hair on my chin and it does not remove it all, I still have to tweeze afterwards to get all the hairs.  It works great on fine hairs and yes, it does hurt so be prepared.  Leaves bumps and ingrown hairs on my chin, so not the miracle product I was looking for.  Time to take the plunge and buy a NoNo hair removal system...</li>
    <li> I would only suggest this product if you are into extreme pain. The product DOES work as intended but to me is not worth the immense pain involved in plucking out multiple hairs very quickly and brutally. If electrolysis is absolutely out of the question for you and this is all you can afford,then goodluck! You&#x27;ll need it.</li>
    <li> This may work great for some, but it gave me horribly painful ingrown hairs. I bought this to use on some unsightly hairs that I grow on my chin and neck area. Well the bumps from the ingrown hairs were even more embarrassing to have to deal with. I wish I had kept the packaging because I&#x27;d definitely look into returning this product if I could.</li>
    <li> It took a little getting used to, but once I got the technique down it&#x27;s easy to use.  When it tweezes the hair it feels very \\&quot;grabby\\&quot;, it&#x27;s a little startling at first until you get used to it.  It does hurt, but no worse than tweezing or waxing and it&#x27;s faster and less messy.  It took a few days of epilating for a few minutes at a time to get my face really hair-free, but now I only need to use it once a week or less for touch-ups.</li>
    <li> WOW. I have been getting brazilian bikini waxes for years, and where I live, it costs about $60 once every 6 weeks. I got fed up with paying, and shaving gives me ingrown hairs and red bumps, so I decided to try an epilator. Well, let me just say that little guy is amazing!! I first tried it on my leg to see if I could handle the pain... I could. I&#x27;d liken it to being snapped with a little rubber band, but honestly it&#x27;s not even as bad as a rubber band. I&#x27;d never waxed my legs and the pain was completely bearable. I then tried it on my bikini region--amazing!! It pulls out all the hairs from the root. It left the area a little red with little bumps, but I applied some roll-on \\&quot;Vanish\\&quot; cream, went to bed, and in the morning, I looked and it&#x27;s silky smooth with no redness or bumps!! I 100% recommend this to EVERYONE!!! I&#x27;m considering buying a bigger one now for my legs...for someone who has thick, coarse hair like me and has to shave every day, I can barely imagine the feeling of completely smooth legs. But if the work this Emjoi did on my bikini line is any indicator, I will soon know the feeling.</li>
    <li> This product WORKS, WORKS, WORKS.  Highly recommended.  Quick, effective and relatively painless.  A must for touch ups in between waxing!</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator for my bikini and underarm areas because it is smaller and easier to get into the nooks and crannies!  At the same time, I bought a full-size epilator for my legs (I reviewed that one positively too!)  I thought the underarms would hurt a lot more but once I got past the initial \\&quot;ouch!\\&quot;, I got it done rather quickly.      As for the bikini area, I was able to do a traditional bikini hair removal, but I could not handle the pain when I tried to give myself a brazilian!!!  Wow!  PAIN!  Overall, though, I used it for the majority of my bikini area and did not need to shave during my whole Hawaiian vacation week.  No bumps or irritation as I get from shaving the WHOLE week!  When some of the hair started growning back a couple weeks later, I did get a couple ingrowns.  But I can handle those when the trade-off is smooth, hairless bikini area!  I would definitely buy this again...and I think the price of $20.00 is a steal!!!</li>
    <li> When I initially started using it, some spots would start bleeding if you are not moving quickly over the spots. So once used to this product it&#x27;s not too bad after all. I use it and it works well on areas where you need to hold the skin tight if you have loose skin like we tend to on certain areas like the thighs and move it quick enough where you can get the results and not be hurt or else it can bleed.</li>
    <li> This little machine did a great job removing the hair on my face.  Surprisingly it didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I imagined it would.  The only drawback about using this device is that I had several ingrown hairs a few days after using it.  I would suggest using it after a hot shower on clean, exfoliated skin to help prevent this.  Also, regular exfoliation after hair removal and using an antibacterial astringent would also be a good idea.  I would not suggest using this on underarm or bikini hair because of the fact that there is no protective guard or guide on the rollers, but it works great for touchups and on the face.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit it, but because of hormonal problems..how shall I say it..I got a female beard. I have waxed and it removed a mole..haven&#x27;t done that since. I plucked with a tweezer and it was not as painful as waxing, but it was time consuming. I got this product because of the price and the reviews. I got it within 2 days and because of signing up with Amazon prime..free shipping and handling..YEAH. First of all, it was about six inches long and fits nicely in your hand. It needs 2 AA batteries..which I stole out of a remote..LOL. I foolishly put it straight to a problem area..WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING. It felt like someone took a rubber band and snapped my face. It pulled more than one hair and I felt every inch of that hair. I learned that you have to go to a less overgrown area and start there. Hold at 90 degree angle and move in circular motion. It felt like smaller rubber bands, but you get used to it. You do have to go over some areas more than once and area can get red and a little tender so give yourself breaks if you have more than a couple of hairs****IMPORTANT*** If your hairs are long, cut with scissors first..long hairs HURT and feel like it takes an hour to pull out.</li>
    <li> Even though the price of this product is less, the quality is also very bad. It hurts a lot and it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair completely. Its not meant for removing hair from face. I would rather buy an expensive one than waste money on this. After all you are spending on your skin!!  I gave two star for its price only!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It gets in the more narrow spots.. Wish it came with a recharable batterie tho.. only downfall... All in ALL Great Epilator!</li>
    <li> I tried using this on my face and a few days later had a lot of ingrown hairs so I won&#x27;t use it on my face again.  I used it on my underarms and got pretty good results, but I had to use it a couple of times before I got everything and I still had to tweeze a few strays.  It works on my legs, but it&#x27;s so small that it would take way too long to make it worthwhile.  All in all I guess it does what it says it will do, but my face doesn&#x27;t like it and it&#x27;s too small for my legs so it will be a limited-use product for me.  (Plus it hurts like the dickens!)</li>
    <li> People actually use this on their bikini lines?? THAT is gutsy! I am really surprised at that. You think doing this to your legs is painful? Personally, my bikini area is much more sensitive than my legs.     Pros:  1) lightweight, portable  2) price efficient  3) effective for finer hairs (face, mainly)  4) effective for smaller areas  5) quick to use    Cons:  1) takes too long for larger areas  2) battery operated means that if you didn&#x27;t bring any with you while on vacation, ya gotta go out and find some, but I guess that also makes it a pro for being portable...  3) can irritate the skin--I had a \\&quot;mustache rash\\&quot; for a few days, but I think a good tip would be to condition the skin with some lip balm or petroleum jelly, just enough to moisten the skin. Not too thick, because it will quickly get your device grimy &#x3D;(    You really have to pull the skin taut, or else your skin will definitely get more irritated, as it can even get caught in the device. And THAT hurts!     So use as intended, and you will be fairly satisfied. Remember to bathe in warm water to open up the follicles for easier hair removal, and reduce ingrowns (which, this product can also cause), condition the skin beforehand, and pull the hair taut &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> gals, i&#x27;ve used this on the very fine, thin hairs on my face and on my abdomen.... this thing works sooooo well!!! i was pleasantly surprised.  initially this was just for the abdomen.. but the day of my dentist appt i noticed the hairs above my mouth (i hadn&#x27;t had a wax in over three weeks) so i used this and within a five mintues all of the hairs were GONE!!! i love this and will definitely continue to use this (i hope it doesnt get discontinued).  AND the shipping was pretty fast too!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take off all the hair</li>
    <li> This epilator is great.  I really wanted it for stubborn hairs on my chin,   but thought I would try it on my legs.  It removes unwanted hair in minutes.  The best  part is that the new hair is finer, and very sparse. I was surprised how quickly  this little epilator got the job done. I just wish I had it years ago.  This epilator  is a great time saver.      I purchased it from Amazon and it arrived on time.  I am glad I bought it and  the price at Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I am new to the epilator world but really like this little tool.  I have a larger epilator but, this particular product is great for my arm pits and bikini area.  It is wonderful for touch ups during travel too.  It takes a little while to figure out to use these epilators, but well worth the time.  I never liked shaving my pits and bikini area and wish I had the courage to try these out earlier.  I won&#x27;t go back to shaving that&#x27;s for sure. I recommend patience and practice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as gift for a friend back in Dec 2011.  Her birthday is in March 2012. I finally opened the box and added the batteries before repackaging and the product does not come on, NOTHING!!!. And since I have passed the return policy date, I am out of the $19.  So there you have it, I can&#x27;t comment on the product other than it does not operate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for a few years, with a big heavy one. So the only place I could stand to use it was my legs. I wanted to do more, like my arms, underarms and such. Using this has been such a big help. I even found that it got me used to the pain enough that I could move on to using my big epilator on the more sensitive places that I couldn&#x27;t before. Sooo soft and hairless. I will say that my skin does get red and a little irritated, but that using LUSH&#x27;s Strawberry Feels Massage bar afterwards is ultra soothing with strawberry infusion. [[ASIN:B00285NR5K Strawberry Feels Forever Massage Bar by LUSH]]</li>
    <li> I had another emjoi tat was pretty much worn out and this one is better.  Small enough to get facial hair around corners.</li>
    <li> This product does remove hair but didn&#x27;t work as well on coarse hair...so a bit of a disapointment. I read other reviews before purchasing and decided to buy since some were saying that it works great on coarse hair...but it doesn&#x27;t. For now I will have to stick to threading with my $1.99 spring hair removal which hurts but works great until I can afford one of those expensive tools.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on my upperlip area. The epilating is very painful, but it is worth it for the price. I also use it on my legs and arms, when I travel.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a product like this.  On my chin, where I&#x27;m use to plucking, it worked great and didn&#x27;t hurt at all.  But on my upper lip and around the sides of my mouth it hurt like crazy.  Not only did it leave me splotchy red and sore afterward, it has caused me to break out in dozens of tiny pimples all around my mouth and upper lip - where I never break out!  It&#x27;s the weirdest thing and I can&#x27;t understand why it would cause this to happen, but it&#x27;s making me think twice about using it anywhere but my chin.</li>
    <li> It is a very good item I do like it, but of course it&#x27;s like using an eyebrow plucker of course it&#x27;s going to hurt like that. Over all though it works it&#x27;s at a great price compared to others like it and I do prefer it over my razor...</li>
    <li> This little gadget is a life saver! I&#x27;m of Mediterranean decent and unfortunately have had issues with facial hair since I was a teenager, which has progressively gotten worse as I got older. I&#x27;ve tried it all, waxing, tweeting, creams, laser treatment and even shaving at my most desperate point. Even after about 10 sessions of laser therapy, I still had stubborn hair. Since I could no longer afford laser treatment and was discouraged with having to deal with facial hair I finally gave up until I found this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would hurt but the pain is minimal if at all, especially if you&#x27;ve gone through much more painful treatment such as, laser like me.&lt;br /&gt;I also find that the hair is not visible at least for a week and since it only takes me 10 minutes max to cover every inch of my face, this is great. I&#x27;d like to emphasize that I have dark and thick hair, so I don&#x27;t know if the thickness makes it easier for the product to pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I use the product at every angle of my face: cheeks, upper lips ( be careful), neck and  chin and it works on all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that Emjoi costs less than a pair of movie tickets makes it that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not think twice about purchasing it. My life has improved tremendously thanks to Emjoi.</li>
    <li> i thought it would be good. i tried using it on my bikini area. it did not epilate well. had to run the unit several times over the area to take out the hair. when my patience ran out, i just took a tweezor and tweezed the hair that were left.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE WORST HAIR REMOVER I HAVE USED. IT IS VERY ROUGH ON THE SKIN AND LEAVES RED MARKS. I WOULDNT RECFOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WITH SOFT SKIN.</li>
    <li> So it is embarrassing but yes I am afflicted by some facial hair. I purchased this item after much reviewing and deliberation. I needed something that would help manage some of the growth that occurs on my chin and upper lip. The Emjoi Epi Slim is fantastic. If used regularly it helps to maintain smooth skin. Just a few points to note. If you, like me have sensitive skin you have to be very careful and not put any pressure on the item or you can end up having some patches of raw, red or rough skin. A gentle touch works well here. Also, I find if helpful to apply a diluted amount of tea tree oil to a clean face prior to using the Epi Slim. Depending on how hairs are pulled, it can cause ingrown hair or small irritation pimples. Using something astringent before and after helps prevent this. In all, I adore the Epi Slim. At this price I might buy another one just in case mine kicks the bucket. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Terrible - hurts too much to use.  needs a guard over the blades</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. I used this and the first week looked fine, but as soon as the hair started to grow back in the problem was extremely noticeable. I have had a skin infection for over a month now. I&#x27;ve gone to the doctor and gotten antibiotics and am now working with a dermatologist to try and prevent scarring from the bumps it left all over my face. Luckily it hurt so much I didn&#x27;t use it in too large of an area, but everywhere I used it I now have bumps worse than cystic acne that hurt and look horrible. Everyone in my family keeps asking me what&#x27;s wrong with my face. It&#x27;s awful. Please try something else.</li>
    <li> This is handy.  This is my first epilator.  Only downside is that the plastic on both sides of the tweezers scratch my skin.  They should make that part more round.  And pulling underarm hair is like going to the dentist.  It&#x27;s painful! You really just want to get it over with.  (it&#x27;s amazing how underarm hair may appear as 2mm stubble but the root is like 3mm)  Underarm hair is tough.  Also this thing is loud, it sounded like an electric pencil sharpeneer.  Dare I say, I had fun with this.  I used it on my fingers and tamed the edges of my arm hair.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this and maybe one day I&#x27;ll upgrade to a more expensive one.  Update:  I think everything but my underarm hair is too thin for the Epislim to pull it from the root.  I was surprised to see hair growing back on my legs so soon.  The Epislim is really just cutting/ripping it off. :(  I guess epilating just isn&#x27;t for my legs.</li>
    <li> I bought the Emjoi to replace another of a different brand. I liked it but it really wasn&#x27;t working to remove hair the way I expected it to. For the price it works good.</li>
    <li> First, it is very important to know~this Emjoi Epi WORKS! I am blond and am lucky to have blond facial growth but it truly bothers me. Yes, only me because my husband says I have no \\&quot;mustache\\&quot;! That&#x27;s because it seems I&#x27;m always working on it. When the light hits the blond hair just right, it looks like peach fuzz everywhere! Now remember, the Emjoi works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first experience with and epi. Easy to follow directions and unit is easy to use and clean. I did try it on the back of my hand and even my thigh. No complaints there and I ASSUMED the feeling would be consistent elsewhere on my body....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so. The plucking on my face, (especially my upper lip) brought tears to my eyes! I could not help it but would even yelp! After the first round, I gave myself a break and was amazed how much better it looked....minus the fact that my skin was totally red!!! Yes, it hurts!! No way around it. But it works great and I have used it since the initial try and will continue to use it. It is small enough and it is shaped perfectly to fit in your hand. May the force be with you, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you don&#x27;t give up!</li>
    <li> i bought this little device solely for my underarm hair.  this works just as good as i expected!   It is painful !! but I can deal with this amount of pain.. (for beauty ..lol)  the underarm hair has been my biggest worry . I couldn&#x27;t able to remove it completely clearly! since my hair is thick and dark.. but this lovely cheap emjoi solved my looong standing worry! :)     I bought the cheap one cos I didnt want to take risk ..  and Im very happy to get this perfect hair remover for this price! haha    highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as the Braun brand and it does the job! It is nice that it is cordless but still has power.</li>
    <li> This is the most god-awful painful thing that I have ever put my body thru, and that&#x27;s including natural childbirth, 2 surgeries, and the 5 inch heels I bought last week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator, about once a month, for the past 4 years.  I have only used it to remove the blonde hairs on my upper lip and it has worked great everytime.    Each time, for the first couple of rubs on my lip, it hurts a bit... but as soon as some of the hairs have been removed, I get used to it and it feels fine.  I find that I have to turn it sideways (so the tip is vertical) and it works the best that way.  I love this little product...I am not sure how it would work on a larger area of my body, but for what I need it for, it works great!</li>
    <li> IF YOU NEED A QUICK TOUCH UP ON YOUR CHIN, LIP, OR UNDERARM THIS IS THE ITEM TO HAVE. REMOVES HAIR WITH JUST  A LITTLE PINCH, COMPARED TO WAXING.  A DEFINITE MUST HAVE FOR ALL WOMEN.</li>
    <li> I ordered this epilator based on the reviews. I have PCOS and with that comes facial hair, and for a woman (well most) facial hair is more embarrassing than passing gas in line at the grocery store. This device works. Its painful at first (like waxing..only not messy) but you get used to it. I used it on my chin last week n have been clear of hair 7 days now. Finally something that works (albeit temporarily)</li>
    <li> Just used for the first time today.  It does pull a little bit.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on facial hair due to PCOS and hirituism.  It was much to painful for my upper lip (more pain over a longer period of time and less effective than waxing).  The pain for my chin area was much more tolerable and it worked great the first time but not when the hair grew back.  I would see the hair in the mirror and try to get the epilator to grab them but it wouldn&#x27;t.  I finally gave up and used a tweezer.  This is supposed to grab hair long enough for tweezing but it didn&#x27;t.  It really only worked on long fine hair in non-sensitive places.</li>
    <li> I bought this product recently and if I still had the packaging I would return asap for my money back! Ended up going back to tweezing and waxing to get the job done as using this was as effective as going over my face hairs with a regular comb! Loud, clumsy and ineffective.  Searching for a new product and hope I can get it right this time.</li>
    <li> I have used this often, and it is true some tugging &amp; pain is involved, but so much faster than tweezing, plus at my age, seeing the hairs is getting to be a real bother. I had to shorten my fine upper lip hair the first time I used it, as they were a bit long. Upper lip usage is the most painful, but I do like the no fuzz look. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is very smooth &amp; soft. Maybe this helps the circulation? I am 49, &amp; impressed with this little item. I am ordering another one today to keep in my camper, so I never forget to have one on hand. I suggest using good quality batteries for longer battery life. If you are sensitive to pain, you could try numbing your upper lip area with ice. I even tried orajel, which didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> i did my armpits, best to do it after showered. taut the skin a bit and ignore the pain, its hurts but its not too massively. i like the results smooth and painless afterwards, no welts or irritations. the only thing with the smaller shorter thinner hairs don&#x27;t pluck out but thats no biggie just shave em off afterwards. I really like it and will be keeping it. good investment for a low price. JUST DO IT..  and buy it!</li>
    <li> Hurts at first; pain bearable though.  Did have some ingrown hairs at first.  Now, the little hair that grows back is very fine, not coarse.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for removal of facial hair.  I had tried removal creams and waxing, neither of which fully removed the coarsest hairs on my chin. This item works great and removes all the facial hair.  Yes, it stings a bit on the upper lip - I had to learn to really pull the lip taut with my bottom lip - but the effect is wonderful.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before and wanted to give it a try without spending too much money (just in case I couldn&#x27;t handle the pain).  This was a good first timer product.  I won&#x27;t lie, its painful.  However, I am glad to have an alternative to shaving and waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it a 3 star review is it doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hair in one pass (on your legs).  In fact it doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair in 2 or 3 passes, which makes this process incredibly time consuming.  Maybe its because my hair is growing in all different directions, so you have to angle it just right for it to pick up the hair.  Or maybe the hair is growing at different lengths, But I just don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of wish I had gone with something pricier that would pick up all the hair in one or 2 runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I just used this for my underarms and am really impressed.  It is perfect for your underarms where shaving leaves unsightly marks and discoloration and waxing is just too messy.</li>
    <li> This epilator is convenient for travel and works well.  It would be better if it came with a travel case and cleaning brush, but these are minor issues.</li>
    <li> Excellent little product. Very good for &#x27;tidying up&#x27; around the bikini line. However, need to use good quality batteries - cheap ones don&#x27;t last long! Very compact and easy to use. Would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was almost tempted to return this product because it did not have the same power as my corded emjoi epilator.  However, when I used it on my face, I changed my mind and decided to keep this unit for travel purposes.  It&#x27;s definetly not a replacement for your existing corded unit but for travel and supplemental uses, and for the price, this unit is a good addition.  It works best on the face and bikini lines, not as well on the legs or underarms but in a pinch, it will do.  The tweezer area is small but not small enough to be used in the eyebrow area.  I belive emjoi makes yet another unit for that application.  It is nice to have the convenience of a cordless unit but since this is designed for such small areas it&#x27;s not practical for your legs.  Quick touchups are fine but count on another unit if you are going to be needing more power to do larger areas.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  I am pleased with it and the results.  It is a very good value, as well.  The only minor drawback is that it is a little loud, but I would not return it for that reason.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product expecting it will remove my facial hair and no bad effects since it&#x27;s specifically a facial epilator. So I cleaned my face before using it. Warning it reallllly hurt! Yes it does remove hair but not the smallest one. So while using it I notice some redness but I continued thinking it would be mild reaction and then next morning I noticed a lot of red bumps on my face (most on cheeks)!! I was really pissed and it took 2 weeks to disappear and some left scar. I wasted my money and I will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> First I have to say thank you to the previous reviewers, they gave me the courage to buy &amp; try this, so thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!! I even just bought one for my sister who now loves it as well. It can be intimidating when you first look at it but don&#x27;t be fooled. It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; works beautifully! Anything heavier than peach fuzz type hair feels just like using tweezers (but with much better results) The peach fuzzy type is a bit stingy at first but use it gradually &amp; it gets better over a short period of time &amp; then all is well.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this, I hope to never go back to tweezing!!</li>
    <li> This is not an item to use on thick or course hair. If the hair is thin and sparse, it works well, If the hair is thick and heavy, it is a torture tool,</li>
    <li> I do not know if this item is suppose to be painful, but if that&#x27;s it&#x27;s fuction, then the Epi Slim does that beautifully.</li>
    <li> Just as it is described, this epilator is great for removing hair in small places.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face and bikini line (cleaning it with rubbing alcohol in between uses).  It&#x27;s difficult to say how painful the process is because pain tolerance is so subjective.  For me, it wasn&#x27;t so bad.  I&#x27;m used to waxing.  It&#x27;s so important to start with short hair!  This will reduce the pain by quite a bit.  Sometimes it can take several passes to grab all of the hair, which is annoying, but when I&#x27;m finished, my areas are neat and tidy.  The hair doesn&#x27;t grow back overnight as it does with shaving.  If you want an epilator for your legs, I&#x27;d skip this one.  It&#x27;s just too small.  But for small areas, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> This product works great on the face, and any other small area. Also great for traveling and little touch ups...  Totally recomend it, but if you can&#x27;t take some pain then this is not for you. It does hurt a little bit in the begining but after a while you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Is terrible I don&#x27;t like it hurts so bad I wish I can return this product and get my money back</li>
    <li> Not as good as the full-size, rechargable Gold Caress.  This one vibrates too fast and bounces off the skin.</li>
    <li> I really hoped this would do a better job on facial hair.  I use it almost daily and still can&#x27;t keep up.  I have light colored hair.  I can&#x27;t imagine it would work at all for someone with dark or coarse hair.</li>
    <li> It really does not remove the hair very well.  It is slower than using tweezers to try to take the hair off my chin.  Would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and it has made me totally certain I will never try this method again. First impression is it&#x27;s LOUD and scary. Not something I want near me. Looks like a torture device! I decided to give it a shot anyways and not only did it not work very well (lots of breaking hairs rather than plucking them) but it feels like a torture device. I have waxed before and it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as this thing. Not even close. Especially on my legs I&#x27;m not that sensitive to hair pulling pain, I have waxed and tweezed before and it wasn&#x27;t an issue, but this thing made my eyes water. Never again. If you want to get rid of hair, try waxing. Much less painful than this!</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I love it. I always have a problem with my hair on the upper lip and underarms and it did work. Love it :)</li>
    <li> Took me a while to figure out how to use it to where it was actually pulling the hairs but now that I know how to make it work it does the job.</li>
    <li> I like this product quite abit. it beats shaving and bleaching.  The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is because it pains so much.  Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the emjoi epilator ap 9lc to replace an ancient Epilady I&#x27;d had since epilators for facial hair first came on the market.  It worked so much better than my old one--faster, longer-lasting, and no more painful--that I was delighted and ordered another for a vacation home.      However, the first one stopped working after 12 months.  SInce it was still under warranty, I returned it to the manufacturer for repair or replacement.  Since I was told that could take up to a month, I ordered a 3rd one through Amazon; that one arrived yesterday and didn&#x27;t work at all on three different sets of batteries (all tested first).  I now have to return that to the vendor, which is time-consuming and annoying, not to mention the shipping fee, which comes to over 25% of the purchase price and which the vendor won&#x27;t refund (the vendor only pays for the cost of the return, via an RNA label).      Bottom line:  Good product, poor quality control.</li>
    <li> I use this Epi Slim every couple weeks, and it works great! it reduced the appearance of hair over time , and it is safe enough to use on my face. It irritates your skin a little up front, so use it when you have a few hours to let your skin calm down.</li>
    <li> At first, I couldn&#x27;t decide between this one and the larger Braun one, and then I figured, well I only need it for my underarms and bikini, so I&#x27;ll just go with the smaller Emjoi. I am so glad I went with this one because I just absolutely love it. I actually threw away my razor after the first time I used it, and haven&#x27;t looked back. It fits very nicely in your hand and since it&#x27;s battery powered, you can travel with it. Works perfectly for underarms and bikini.</li>
    <li> This really hurts much worst than tweezing (beauty is pain but ouch I&#x27;ll have to try something else).</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly pleased that this item worked as well as it did. Great for face and touch ups! highly recomend.</li>
    <li> If you have a true facial hair problem, this product will change your life.  It took me several attempts to learn the technique (including a chin that looked as if I&#x27;d scraped it from a bad fall on my first try!), but once mastered, it is easy and quick.  Due to some medications I take, my facial hair growth had gotten to the point that I was secretly borrowing my husband&#x27;s electric razor :-(.  I nearly cried each day, because I had rough razor stubble all over my face---I imagined being the bearded lady in a freak show, if I ever found myself without a razor for any amount of time.    Once I got the hang of this product, I used it daily for a while.  I admit it, it became an obsession.  What&#x27;s wonderful is that hair grows at different speeds.  When I used to wax, I&#x27;d miss many hairs, and it would seem to grow back quickly.  Now, I realize that it wasn&#x27;t the same hairs growing back quickly, but instead it was new ones.    Using this product daily for a few weeks enabled me to get ALL of the facial hair, as it grew back.  Now, I&#x27;m happy to say that aside from a few stubborn chin hairs that seem to grow overnight, my face is smooth again.  Even when it grows back, it is softer and finer, and I suspect that after I continue to use this product for many months to come, I will eventually have much much less facial hair permanently.    I&#x27;m still a little obsessive, so I likely use the product more than necessary, but I am so much less self conscious when I find myself in bright sunlight.      The batteries seem to last forever, too.  I&#x27;m using rechargeable ones, so there is literally no maintenance expense.  Yes, it hurts, but if you&#x27;ve waxed or tweezed, you&#x27;re used to the pain level.  I hardly notice it, and I actually like the feeling of the small sting, knowing I&#x27;ve gotten that sucker!    For a minimal investment, this product has been amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes it could help me remove my facial hair. Unfortunately, all the device does is make a lot of noise, but it didn&#x27;t remove a single hair! No matter WHAT angle I held it at (the instructions say 90 degrees), the device buzzed along but just didn&#x27;t grip. I am familiar with epliators and have an effective one for other body areas, but I wanted one for the face and finer hair. It wouldn&#x27;t even remove the longer hairs from the back of my hand. This device was useless and I feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed.</li>
    <li> I have terrible, coarse, dark hair! This is the Eppilator that changed my life and saved me time showering! I decided to buy one specifically for my legs also. I will never shave my legs or bikini line again just to have stubble within hours! I&#x27;m so happy about this! I would reccommend this to anyone for smaller/more precise areas;)</li>
    <li> Received this item today.  Doe not hurt at all, not even a little bit.  And this is my first time with an item like this.  No pain what so ever.  Feels more like a little tickle than anything else.  Nice and small and easy to use.  Not as noisy as I thought it would be either.  Again, there is no pain at all.  None at all!  I use the quick motions I saw demonstrated on HSN on t.v. and that may be mostly the reason it does not hurt.  Plus the directions tell you not to use it as you would a shaver.  Also, cicular motions are suggested by the directions too.  You might feel a little sting and that is the machine plucking out hairs.  You might feel that and you might not.  No regrets for having bought this item.  Used on both lower arms and they look so nice like they do when I have just taken a shower and my body is super clean.  The skin was  not prepared first either.  No wipes or anything used first.  I just opened the package and started using the epilator.  I have read some reviews on this site where people said they had some pain with some of these epilators, but I had no pain at all period!  NONE!  I even have 2 more of a different type coming, but when I get them I will write a review on them too.    Janice</li>
    <li> Hair removal is one of those subjects one discusses only with close g-friends, and only with those who ask. Since you&#x27;re here reading reviews, I&#x27;m guessing that you&#x27;re on a need-to-know basis--perhaps someone who, like myself, has a little \\&quot;lady mustache\\&quot; you&#x27;d really like to get rid of, quickly, effectively, cheaply, and possibly even painlessly.  I was handing over $13 (including tip) every time I asked the nice woman at the threading salon to do her thing with the string and de-mustache me. At first, 13 bucks once a month wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call overspending. Unforch, necessity dictated that I start to visit the salon twice a month. That came to $312 a year that Suze Orman would&#x27;ve begged me to put into an interest-bearing account (do those exist anymore?). Factor in train fare and we&#x27;re up to $408 of k-ching a year--just to keep me from looking like the Frito Bandito.   Emjoi Ap-9L Cosmetic Hair Remover to the rescue! I bought it on the basis of reviews here on good ol&#x27; Amazon, and I thank the people who also told their embarrassing hair removal stories. I pay the favor forward. In short: This thing works. I use it on my upper and lower lip areas, my chin, and on the (ahem) bikini area. The Emjoi is as effective as my dear threading lady, which is to say that it will remove most hairs, occasionally break others, and leave some behind. You will have to go over the area a few times. TIP: For optimal results, apply a little baby powder or corn starch to the area you&#x27;re depilating so the mechanical tweezers grab only the hair and don&#x27;t catch on your skin.   Oh, you want to know about the pain? Of course it hurts a little; you&#x27;re ripping hairs out of your skin at high speed. But on a pain scale of 0 (none) to 10 (you can hear my scream in Ohio), I would give this a 2 1/2. As for my overall 4-star rating, I didn&#x27;t give it five only because I do have to go over the area a few times more often than I thought; also, sometimes the tweezers break the hairs, which leaves me with stubble to yank another day. That could be particular to my hair, though.   I hope this was helpful because I am just blushing away. See what I do for my friends?

    <li> I have never used epilator before in my life. After so many good reviews about the product wanted to give it a try. I shoudl admit I made no wrong decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features you will love about the product&lt;br /&gt;Portable&lt;br /&gt;Battery so not to worry taking it anywhere/any country (and run for adapter)&lt;br /&gt;Very compact and handy&lt;br /&gt;Best pricing to try something new for first time&lt;br /&gt;Works great and removes even tiny hairs&lt;br /&gt;Not painful at all if you keep your skin tight when using&lt;br /&gt;Works perfect evn for facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that might have been better&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was some way to remove the product and clean instead of using the tiny brush</li>
    <li> This is alot better than my other enjoi that was alot more expensive. This one catches fine hairs and the hard to reach crevices ie your crotch without pinching the skin like the big ones:) but all in all better than shaving and results are awesome:) hair free 2-3 weeks no worries.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item and I recommend to anyone!   I actually put batteries that were already semi-used and it still worked great, so in other words, the batteries last a long time. Its easy to use, easy to clean and since its travel sized, makes it convenient for storage.  During the actual hair-removing procedure, I tested it on a small area, like the back of my hand, and it did such a nice job without too much discomfort I was eager to finish the job on the rest of my arms and legs.   I am so happy I found this machine!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with tweezing the hairs on my face that I find hard to see.  I find this extremely helpful grabbing the hairs that I don&#x27;t see, as well as the ones I do.  It&#x27;s much faster than doing it one at a time with just a tweezers.  I&#x27;ve used the Emjoi 72 tweezer head to get rid of body hair and love it.  I&#x27;ll admit, I tried using it on my face but, it simply wasn&#x27;t designed for that.  This one certainly is capable of doing the job without pain.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It does hurt a bit,but you kind of get used to it after a while. It&#x27;s good for the upper lip and chin. After I took a shower I tried under my arm, but it didn&#x27;t seem to get much hair and it was pretty painful.For the price it&#x27;s a good product.Also, I am a woman.</li>
    <li> Had it over a year. Handy tool.Bought one for my neice too.Happy with purchase.  Easy to use, great to carry around!</li>
    <li> This might be a bit long, but bare with me ok?&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this, I figured why not. If I dont like it, at least I didnt blow a ton of money on it right? Then I was talking with my best friend, and she told me about her nightmare experience with an epilator. So yesterday when it came in the mail I was quite nervous. I opened the plastic packaging (it is one of those annoying kinds that requires superman to open.), popped in 2AA batteries, and flicked it on. My eyes got really big because of how loud it is. My husband laughed, and asked me what I expected! haha... Then I gave it a test run down my right leg. Squinching my eyes and turning my head away. I didnt really notice any hair removed but I felt it! My husband tried it on his arm, and swore a lot haha!&lt;br /&gt;I waited till after he went to bed last night to really give it a go. Now please keep in mind, this is my first epilator, and I knew there would be pain. So I had to take breaks from time to time.... on one leg. Seriously. After a few attempts I finally got the leg done! It had really angry red bumps (expected... after all you are ripping the hairs out), and I applied the Emjoi after epilation cream. The bumps calmed down almost (ALMOST) immediately. I waited about an hour before doing my right leg, reason being is because I thought that I would do a review video of how it works, and the before and after results. I am sorry, I was too excited over this.&lt;br /&gt;It also does toes too! I always had a problem with socks ripping the baby fine hairs out of my toes, and now I dont even have to worry about that anymore! I will be getting another epilator soon, I am thinking the Emagine. It is pricy, but I really do think that I am in love!! If this device can keep my legs spike free for even 2 weeks I will be in heaven!&lt;br /&gt;I will be doing a review of the cream in a week or two so that I can give it a fair review. So far I am liking that stuff too!</li>
    <li> When I read that this was for the face, I thought I&#x27;d try it. Wow, it&#x27;s great for the price. I thought it would hurt badly, but it&#x27;s not very painful (it hurt much more on the arm than on the face). I have only been using it short time, but I&#x27;m very impressed. Since the batteries will need replacement, I decided to order rechargeables.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It also slows the growth of your hair. It takes little practice to get used to this product. But once you know how to use correctly it removes most fine to thickest hair. I prefer it over wax as it does the same job without mess.</li>
    <li> Great for doing facial area.  Haven&#x27;t tried it in the bikini area.  Much better than waxing, does not leave your face red and sensitive.  Would recommend this product to anyone that does face waxing, like the dreaded mustache.</li>
    <li> I had an older model epi device with a cord, bulky and decided to treat myself to the light weight Epi Slim it works well and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I am prepared for summer bikini season!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on the underarm area which is the only area I have used it on at this point. I have dark hair with pretty fast growth and I have never ever had what I consider a great shave under the arms. There is always some hint of stubble. This product plucks the hairs out clean and leaves the skin so soft. I have to say this is painful but well worth it. I let the hair grow for a few days and then did the underarms in sessions after taking a warm shower as suggested. I would do about 5 minutes on each underarm for a few days until it looked perfect. The pain does get better but it is painful as you are pulling the hairs out from the root. Also, I found that doing it in circles as sugggested did not work well at all for me. Instead I ran it back and forth and changed directions as needed as you would with a regular electric razor. You can tell if you are going the right way because you will hear and of course feel the hairs pulling. Point is, you may need to change directions several times and try out different ways before realizing which is most effective for you and the area you are doing. This has to be one of the best investments I have made. I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best facial hair removers that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> it works good for those longer hairs but as for the tiny short ones like on the chin i still have to pluck those other than that this is a great way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> This item is a piece of junk!  Ordered the first which arrived and would not even turn on!  Returned for replacement which was prompt, and the 2nd was exactly the SAME as the first one!  It wouldn&#x27;t even turn on!  Worthless.  Not bothering a third time!</li>
    <li> I have been using an old Braun epilator for years, and recently lost it.  Thank goodnes, or I would have never tried the Emjoi AP-9LC Epi Slim Compact Epilator.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this this thing.  I use it on my upper lip and chin and it leaves your skin so soft.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my underarms. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and really does the job. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d consider using it on bikini area myself, but for those pesky chin hairs it works wonders. Not as painful as I thought, and was easy to tolerate after first couple of times. Works on fine hairs and course as well.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.Says it&#x27;s easier to manage her daily routine.</li>
    <li> I have had one for several years and like the ease of use.  It works!  So I have bought 3 others as gifts.</li>
    <li> Okay, I expected that using this device would not be altogether painless, but- !OUCH! is an understatement.  Just be prepared, oh consumer...</li>
    <li> Was a little scared of this at first. But thought I would try it. But it works great. A little stinging in some areas but alot faster and better than using tweezers.</li>
    <li> This is small yet really does the trick...the more you use it the less the discomfort becomes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for the hair on my face,  which is what I wanted it for. It cuts the hair off more often than it pulls it out.</li>
    <li> This product is a time saver. God blessed me with more than average facial hair. I have spent 30 minutes to an hour a day plucking for the last six years of my life. I started a job that requires me to work many hours so I needed to try another method than plain old tweezers. This saves me at least 20 minutes a day. It doesn&#x27;t get every hair (thats why it only gets 4 stars). It actually seems to miss the bigger ones more than the small ones. As far as pain goes it hurts a little, but not enough for me to not want to use it. I would say it hurts less than waxing though. Its only $20 it is worth a try. I think once I get the hang of this one I might try one of the more expensive epilators in hopes of getting one that gets all the hairs.</li>
    <li> Well, I was very excited to receive this, but it didn&#x27;t work as hoped for me.  I purchased it for use in the bikini and under arm area.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to achieve results in the under arm area.  I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get the skin taught enough.  I lacked the correct angle and needed more hands I think.  As for the bikini area, it worked ok, but left me too irritated.  I followed the instructions and exfoliated, but I was still left w/ some ingrown hairs.  I had this problem before w/ waxing, so I think I am just not a good candidate for this kind of hair removal.</li>
    <li> Product works much better than I expected. I would recommend this any women who has facial hair. I love it</li>
    <li> When I received the emjoi epilator, I really underestimated the amount of pain I was going to be in for the first time around.  I had never waxed or epilated before and OMG did it hurt. Luckily, I wanted my $15 worth of this product so I kept using it and it does get better!! A lot better!!  I bought this tiny one to see if I could handle epilating on my legs before I put money into a larger more expensive model, and although it removes the hair nicely and I appear to be hairless, I&#x27;m not as smooth as a clean shave:(. This is the reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars and not 5.    I also wanted to use this on my bikini line but I&#x27;m just not that brave right now.  I&#x27;m planning on getting waxed first to remove the majority of hair and then using the epilator for cleanup so it won&#x27;t be so intense.    Anyway long story short, THE PAIN DOES GO AWAY!!!! and your hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast and I&#x27;ve only been using it a month :)    I think it says a lot about the effectiveness of this little guy that I&#x27;m now willing to spend around $80 on a bigger verson for my legs.  But for smaller areas I would highly recomend it. Also, I used it on my arms once, and it did</li>
    <li> Wish I could send it back, just don&#x27;t feel like being bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurts a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you can tolerate pain, it literally feels like my arm hairs are being plucked one by one. Same on my legs.</li>
    <li> Awful product. doent even shave my 10 year daughter. dont buy it. it is a waste of money! i cant use it.</li>
    <li> Way too much pain for face..used 1 time never again</li>
    <li> Wow, can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been hand tweezing all these years! This stuff is much more efficient, and I can do it while watching TV. But I do have to pass it several times in the same area to get all the hairs out.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap. It hardly takes out any hair, and when it does it&#x27;s sporadic. I would recommend spending the extra money to get an epilator that will actually work.</li>
    <li> I put in several new batteries, it still would not work.  I must have got a defective one, I tossed it.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim is perfect for removing dark \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; hairs around the mouth (be sure skin is stretched tight). It is relatively painless because it has fewer tweezers than some of the more expensive brands. I did find it necessary to go over the areas several times to completely remove all hairs - so it takes me 1.5 minutes instead of 1 minute.  It also removes very short hairs.  It does not, however, pluck very stiff hairs - if you have just a few chin hairs, you may need tweezers to remove them. Using this epilator is far easier and less painful than chemical hair removal or waxing. If you want to use this for anything besides facial hair, you might want to consider a different device; however, it&#x27;s great (and a great price) for a cosmetic hair remover.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and have tried every method of hair removal there is.. I also have PCOS that makes horrible man like dark hair grow on my face. I am not interested in using an epilator on any other part of my body but face. I have been shaving other areas for years and dont mind doing it..  I got my epislim in the mail TODay and could not wait to use it.. I am SSSSOOOO pleased.&#x3D;!!!!!! my face feels like a childs... No messy aggravating wax pots and clean up afterwards.. It did take a few mimutes but I was  relentess to get every hair... i am sure my technique will improve.. You do have to hold it at the propper angle or it will not grab the hair ... Maybe a bigger more expensive epilator will work better but i have no desire to upgrade anytime soom.. I sat in my recliner w/ a mirror while watching TV....thats the kinda of hair remover works for me :):):):) very happy no more man hair on my face!!!!!!  PS it doesnt feel good but when you are fighting the embarassing sight of dark hair on your FACE that you cant hide it is sp worth it.... Electrolysis hurt way worse  not sure on spelling....Beauty is pain lol  its not that bad</li>
    <li> This was my very first epilator.  I actually had to pay a little more through Amazon when I bought mine about a year ago, but the price was reasonable even then.  I am very happy with it.  It is well made and the batteries last a long time.  Since individual hairs grow in different time cycles and my hair grows very fast, I actually use it every few days, and yet I&#x27;ve only had to change the batteries once, a few months ago.  I&#x27;ve had upper lip mustache problems since I was a child, especially the outer corners above my mouth.  Fortunately, they were blonde hairs, but still very noticeable.  Rude people would comment.  As I got much older, those lovely chin wiskers started to appear.  I&#x27;m a senior citizen now, so I have about 10 of those.  I hate them.  However, this epilator solved all of that.  It was a little like needles poking the first few times I used it under my nose, but I got use to it.   I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It does nto remove the small soft hairs on my face and upper lip. It removes SOME but not enough to make a difference. I had more luck with buying wax strips. HOWEVER, it DOES remove underarm hair and hair between the eye brow area, which still makes it useful. I hate shaving underarms and now I don&#x27;t have to anymore!</li>
    <li> This works great for the ladies that have hair on their upper lip!  I have had to shave my upper lip with my husbands razor for years, but then I seen this and had to try it, it works great.  I would recommend it!  I have been using a different model on my legs for months and I have noticed a big improvement and that&#x27;s why I thought I would buy this for my upper lip.  It&#x27;s not too big, it&#x27;s just the right size for your upper lip, this is a great product that works!</li>
    <li> This product works really well...saves me from waxing.  It is a bit painful, bit well worth a little pain...grabs even the smallest hairs</li>
    <li> This works great.  I just used it all over my face and I&#x27;m astounded at how much hair I got off.  CRAZY!!  Its does hurt.  You&#x27;re ripping hair out by the root.  You&#x27;ll have redness for a couple of hours, so use it at night.  Some people said their&#x27;s gets hot but I didn&#x27;t notice that and I did my entire face.  I love it.  I like that it runs on batteries b/c I don&#x27;t need to be stuck near an electrical outlet.  Its perfect for face.</li>
    <li> I had an older version that finally died on me so I got this as a replacement. It works well and is fast and easy. I use it to remove hair from my underarms.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few years ago and love it. I use it on several areas of my body and it works fantastically. Great for removing unwanted hair quickly.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in chin hairs.  However, the&lt;br /&gt;next day I DID notice that I had scabs at the bottom of my chin where I had used the&lt;br /&gt;hair remover.  It went back to the seller that day.</li>
    <li> This thing hurts like hell, no joke.</li>
    <li> This little gem is perfect for all those little hairs that you don&#x27;t see.... of course until your in public in blinding natural light!  If your used to tweezing, this is no more painful, but ALOT easier!!  Highly recommended for any lady with unwanted body hair!</li>
    <li> Useless product. Does not remove any hair. It was advertised as being good for small areas but is a total failure.</li>
    <li> you can cut large hair of you body but if you have little tiny hair in your face it wont cut it because the hair it is very short</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before... nor have I ever waxed.  I bought this because I wanted to do something for my bikini zone. The pain is bearable... so much so that I got a little carried away down there and did a little more than the bikini line.  I have a little swelling and redness as to be expected, but once that goes down, if I find that I like the results I just might use it to go full Brazilian.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with course, dark facial hair for 20 years due to high testosterone levels. I have tried electrolysis, but it was expensive, and the hair would just grow back. Creams only irritated my skin and couldn&#x27;t bleach or break down the hair because it is so course. I had it professionally waxed off once, but that was very painful and expensive. For a year I quit shaving and tried tweezing and threading it myself. This got rid of the grey under the skin, but it was very time consuming, hurt my neck because of the amount of time I had to spend in an odd position, and the motion of tweezing was killing my hands. I then returned to shaving but was painfully reminded of how itchy it made my skin, and by the afternoon I had four o&#x27;clock shadow. So, I began looking for another solution, and decided the Emjoi AP-9L was worth a try and wasn&#x27;t a big investment if it failed. The first week was pretty labor intensive. It took about 3 sessions to remove all the hair because I needed to give my skin a rest. However, any skin irritation I had was way less than what I had experienced waxing. Now that I have removed all the hair, I am using it for a few minutes every evening to remove any hairs that have grown in the last day, and my face feels smooth and comfortable all the time! Instead of hand tweezing for a half hour a day, I use the Emjoi for a few minutes - and it does a much more thorough job! My confidence level has shot up, and I could almost cry, I am so relieved to have found a solution!</li>
    <li> I discovered the existence of epilators only last year when I was doing a random search on the internet on \\&quot;hair removal\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure why epilators aren&#x27;t not talked about as often as waxing. I&#x27;m so happy that I made this discovery. After doing a thorough research, I decided to get the Emjoy AP-9L Epi Slim because I didn&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money into it and plus it had very positive reviews. I was not sure how painful it was going to be even though I am very used to plucking and waxing. I wax my upper lip but this was a whole new ball game.     When I first turned on the epilator, I was so intimidated by the rotating tweezers! Finally I got the courage to use it on my upper lip. I usually wax my upper lip once a week so my hair was long enough to grasp for the wax. I thought is only hurt a little bit (kind of like when you pluck your hair out with a tweezer) but the more I used it, the less painful it became. Initially, I thought, \\&quot;wow, now I don&#x27;t need to wax anymore\\&quot; but I realized that I had to go over the same spot several times before getting \\&quot;most\\&quot; of the hair out (as other reviewers had mentioned). It didn&#x27;t get the teenie hairs that are barely sprouting like I could with wax. Because this was my first epilator, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was using this correctly so I did go on their website and watched the video on how to use this. It was much better than plucking with tweezers but I found myself going back to waxing within a month because it did miss the smaller, finer hairs.    I also tried to do the bikini area and under arms but it was unsuccessful. Again, I had to go over the same spot over and over until I got \\&quot;some\\&quot; hair out. I have to say that this seems to get the coarser/thicker hair better than fine hair. But I was not satisfied.     I am conflicted about whether I should give this epilator a 2 or 3 stars. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s THAT bad, especially with the price...but at the same time, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great (especially now that I&#x27;ve tried anew epilator). I think it is better than plucking individual hairs out with tweezers though it won&#x27;t get all of them. I have to say that using this epilator gave me the courage to try a bigger and better epilator.     After a couple of months of doing another round of epilator research, I decided to get the [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]...and what a difference it made in my life! I love it! It&#x27;s fast and gets the tiniest hairs out! Please read my review for it if you are interested.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving all the time.  The product works pretty well. Hurts like hell, can&#x27;t say I ever waxed.  I have used it in the \\&quot;bikini area\\&quot;  it pulls doesn&#x27;t always pull hair out.  I think that causes more pain than necessary.  Grit your teeth and maybe in 10 minutes you will have a nice clean area.  Maybe a few bumps but they will resolve.  Maybe a higher powered one would hurt less, but for 10 bucks it sure beats a tweezer.  It is bearable.  On the bright side tweezing the few hairs it may miss doesn&#x27;t feel like much at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I am done with shaving.  It&#x27;s painful but nothing I can&#x27;t handle, and it seems to be working fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now. I use it primarily for my underarms and bikini line, which are very sensitive to shaving and waxing. It of course did hurt the first time I used it, but it seems the more I use it, the less sensitive that area is. I only wish I had discovered the concept of an epilator years ago!  Would have saved me a lot of trouble and money.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I have had it for approx. 4 years now and it has continued to work great. Batteries last a long time even if used weekly.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the first one I purchase 25 years ago..unfortunately I removed the top and blades got out of line..because I had such success with my first one 25 years ago,..I thought I would have the same success--not happening...</li>
    <li> This epilator is not worth the money. Its not really effective even on small areas. If hair is too tough or you get too close to skin, the epi stop spinning. It does not work on really fine hair such as the moustache. I will not waste my time using it again and I wish I could return it for my money. You would need a bigger more powerful epi with more tweezers to get the results you would expect.</li>
    <li> I used it according to directions and it didn&#x27;t work on me. It could be my hair type, and I was anxious to get this because of the stellar reviews. It is now in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. It left a rash on my arm, and it left scarring. Good thing I only tested it on a small area before using this product. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving and sometimes wax. Waxing was so messy and irritating to my skin that I wanted to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;This product worked great for bikini-line and and underarms. Can be used 1-2 days after shaving (short hairs were less painful to remove for some reason).  I got fewer ingrown hairs was happy with the ease of use and effectiveness. So far it has been easy to maintain--I touch up once a week. That way I never look hairy and since there is not much hair, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;You would need a larger epilator to use on your legs, but this worked okay to pick up missed hairs from waxing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;It is much tinier than I expected--it would travel very well.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 out of 5 because in some ways a larger epilator might be more practical and it uses batteries faster than I would like.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different epilators and the Emjoi AP-9L Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover is the best I have found.  Due to a burn many years ago I have dark, course facial hairs.  It is very embarrassing.  I tweeze daily, wax often, and usually I am able to take care of most of the hairs but never all.  I recently waxed so I did not know what to expect when I tried this for the first time.  I was amazed when I saw how many hairs were removed.  Usually when we travel abroad I have to worry about a transformer depending on the country we are in.  Now all I have to do is pack extra batteries.  What could be easier???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!  I have been dealing with this problem for over 40 years.  Problem solved and I could not be happier!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I plan to buy a few more for gifts!!</li>
    <li> Never worked and because I didn&#x27;t expect it not to I threw away the packaging, therefor I couldn&#x27;t return it. Very disappointed:(</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a year ago 3/11 very hopefully and just used it on facial hair (don&#x27;t know how it works anywhere else)... while I cannot tell you how many times I used it, it was really not very often.  The last few times I was able to use it, it was difficult to start up, and finally even with fresh batteries it no longer works.  I really feel ripped off and just threw it in the trash... and I paid much less than these prices I&#x27;m seeing now -- yet it still was a ripoff at any price.</li>
    <li> It was quick delivery.  The product was brand new.  It is what I expected it.  It  will not pull every single hair out but well enough that you just needed a little clean up.</li>
    <li> This device does not do what it promised. It just makes a bunch of noise. I did not like it</li>
    <li> I was worried when I got this product that because it was battery operated but I LOVE IT!! its very powerful and it grabs all the hair and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spots 10 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product. would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> I love this handy little epilator!  It works great for smaller areas such as facial hair.  The porice is excellent, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do realize though, that hair grows in stages.  So you will have a good months worth of using this on a regular basis to start seeing results that last weeks, but it will happen.</li>
    <li> So I was feeling EXTRA neurotic and bought both this model and the bigger more expensive [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]].  The Emjoi Slim is really great because it is small and thus less tweezers at a time to remove hair, (less painful, IMO).  I was able to use it on my under arms, bikini, and upper lip fairly easily.  The pain level to me is about a 6 out of10 but I am used to getting brazillian and lip waxing so this was tolerable.  I&#x27;m Japanese, my hair on my underarm and bikini is pretty dark and coarse, so I was really looking for this product to work and it did!!  The speed is not too fast (which I like), much slower than the bigger versions like the Braun 5270.  Runs on double AA batteries so I can take it pretty much anywhere and not be constricted by a stupid power cord. You do have to go over the areas a bit more because it&#x27;s slower and smaller, but I felt like I could pace myself for the pain better than the Braun on my bikini and underarm. I was able to remove hair with \\&quot;tolerable\\&quot; pain from my underarm, frontside of my bikini line (the insides of my legs hurt too much, yes i tried it, so I&#x27;ll  just stuck with shaving those areas for now), and finally my upper lip was super easy! I found doing 1/2 inch sections at a time  and holding skin flat and taut provides the most comfortable way of epilating.  The Braun X&#x27;elle is great on it&#x27;s own but probably will just use it on my underarms and legs since they aren&#x27;t as painful to do in large amounts (to me).      I highly recommend this product! It&#x27;s the closest I got to waxing results.  Would be great for touchups in between waxing or just using regularly.  Prob not too good if you have sensitive skin, but the bumps go away within 8-12hours.  I also used this product called \\&quot;get the bump outta here by deborah&#x27;s esthetics (google it), which I bought from my esthetician after my brazillian waxes and it worked really well in helping control the irritation after epilating too.  I love that my underarms and bikini areas can now be hair free at my control and not have to wait 2+ weeks for it to \\&quot;grow out\\&quot; to properly wax.. And it looks so much than shaving! no shadows! &amp; all this for less than half of a single waxing session.</li>
    <li> This is a good little epilator for the face.  I prefer the Braun for other areas, but this one works well for more sensitive areas (bikini, face).  Good product.</li>
    <li> I ordered one for me &amp; likes it so much I bought one for my health aid.  Effective w very little pain</li>
    <li> I am African-American and I have very coarse hairs.  I literally will grow a beard and mustache if I do not remove the hair.  I have tried shaving but I get ingrown hairs that lead to hair bumps that lead to dark spots on my  skin.  Waxing hurts and is difficult to do properly because the hairs are so coarse.  Tweezers take forever.  I was getting electrolysis but the treatments are expensive and it was going to take like 8 at $150 a pop to get everything.  I happened to be in Target one day and saw the Emjoi EpiSlim.  That was years ago.  I still have the same one.  It still works great.  The batteries last about a month.  It does hurt but you get used to it after a while.  I use it daily and it takes about five minutes.  I only use it for my face.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Just got my emjoi epi slim in tonight! I have tried it out and while it works! (YAY!) I have to agree with what some have said in these reviews that it does take a couple of times of going over the area before you get all the hair... Using on the armpits is particularly difficult trying to pull the skin taught on top of trying to see exactly what you&#x27;re doing.... While I don&#x27;t find it all that painful I know some people might.. especially (like some on here have said) if you have never waxed before it will definitely not be a pleasurable experience the first few times... I used to wax so I&#x27;m used to how it feels to have the hair ripped out by the root... For the first use, so far so good... hopefully the next use will be quicker and even better!</li>
    <li> I bought this to stop paying lots of $$ for a lip wax (which usually makes me break out anyway). I am so glad I did. Ok, it is a little painful, but you have to expect that, right? Once you get used to it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
    <li> This little epilator does the job. I can use it on my face and chin area. It doesn&#x27;t snap out every little hair but it significantly reduces the need to tweeze. Plus it was very inexpensive. Be aware that epilators hurt. But it&#x27;s not too bad and it is way better than searching out and tweezing every little hair. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Have had this item for about 3 weeks and find it not much better than the Tweezie that had been advertised on TV about 5 years ago.  It does remove some of the facial hair but I still have to use tweezers.</li>
    <li> I bought this item since swimsuit season is coming up, and wanted to try an alternative to waxing.  The pain level is the same, but it takes much more time than expected to clear an area of hair.  Sometimes it will grab a hair and pull, but not always remove it.  You&#x27;re still subject to the same ingrown hairs as waxing or shaving.  When I used it between my eyebrows on the light, finer hair, there was little result.  Would only recommend as a removal tool for thicker hair.  It&#x27;s a very loud gadget, and somewhat intimidating if you&#x27;ve never tried one before.  It gets the job done, but I&#x27;m just as likely to wax to get it over more quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this one as well as Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover which cost $61 and also Philips Hp6378/10. Among this three, I have to say this one only $14.77 works BEST!!! It peels hair from the root, very clean! I am a firt-time epilator user. I felt hurt at the beginning, but once you get used to this one, it works perfectly! I definitely recommend this one! Not because of the low price compared with other Emjoi or Pilips, but it just does awesome job!!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, Its not Painful like horrible, Its like tweezing your eyebrows, Its works and Is so much quicker then anything else but it is painful and I feel like I can only do so much at a time. But after a few months use it stop working?</li>
    <li> I do recommend this. I received it within estimated time. I bought another cheaper brand and that didn&#x27;t work. This one works, just follow the instructions. How durable this is? I don&#x27;t know. I use it for my chin only. You can feel the hair being pulled out. I use a tweezer before and it takes a longer time. I took away a star, because I don&#x27;t like the pink color, I got it at a higher price, and it doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy.</li>
    <li> i already own the emjoy gently caress and bought this for touch ups. it is very comfortable and light. however, it is too small for large areas.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace the emjoi tweeze that i lost.. thinking this must be similar..which it is mostly...I think its a lil rougher on the skin...hence the 4 stars...also because i will have to buy rechargeble batteries...     If not for that..i would give this 5 stars...ITs good on upper lips..chin..under arms...even foreheard for me...Best of all i do touch ups with this on my legs when my hair is still short...and though this tiny epilator is time consuming..it does the job...I had smooth legs for a long time with regrowth similar to after waxing...anyways...its a lil cumbersome considering its size...and purpose...but i love it...for both face and legs.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t know how I got along before I got this thing.  I wish I had gotten it years ago....it would have saved me SO MUCH time!  I have very dark, coarse hair, and I have always manually tweezed unwanted facial hair.  It was very time consuming, and I always felt like I was fighting a losing battle, because I just couldn&#x27;t keep up, and it would grow faster than I could pluck! :-)  Then I got this, and it was so incredibly FAST and THOROUGH!  Even when I plucked, I&#x27;d miss all the little hairs.  This thing gets &#x27;em all!  I&#x27;m not sure how it works on fine-haired people, but it&#x27;s GREAT for me!  **Special note...Epilators and auto-tweezers such as these are much less painful for you IF and ONLY IF you are used to plucking &amp; waxing to begin with.  If you are a newbie to the world of hair-removal, then I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s no getting around it hurting, until you get used to it.  If the process of hair-removal is old-hat for you, then your skin will be used to it, and you will be VERY pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> About a year ago I bought one of these for myself. I was spending a good 3 hours tweezing. For Christmas this year I took mine to my mothers and she was complaining on how she had to shave everyday. I offered to let her use mine and I was lucky to get it back before I left. So I went ahead and bought her one as well. We both love the convience and ease.</li>
    <li> I am returning this product today.  I used it on my face and for each hair it removed, it left me with a blemish.  I had blemishes all over my cheeks, chin, upper lip and neck.  It&#x27;s been almost a week and they are finally starting to go away.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t try this product any closer to my wedding date!  I will go back to waxing!</li>
    <li> This product works as well as I would expect from Emjoi. It is a little stronger than most, and you do have to be careful not to use too much pressure, but it really gets everything! I bought this to replace a Braun Silk Epil Facial Epilator and it does a better job, and faster.    Even though I bought it for facial use, it would be great for leg, underarm, and bikini touch-ups while traveling. I just wish it came with a travel or storage case of some kind. I had to use a cosmetics case of my own for storage, but at least it&#x27;s small enough to fit in one. (That&#x27;s why I only give it 4 stars.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review nor have I ever used an epilator before but I felt compelled to write this one.  IMO, I think the key to epilating is to exfoliate first. I started a beauty regime since I am now 1 year away from the big 50!     I started by buying a [[ASIN:B000V2J3ZK Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser, Pink]] to clean my face daily which also exfoliates. Then I started using the Emjoi Sin Dolar epilator (Walmart or Target) to use on my face. Since exfoliating for about a week before I used this it worked wonderfully. I then bought the Emjoi EpiSlim to do the smaller parts of my face and upper lip. To my surprise it got hairs off that the bigger one missed! It did a wonderful job on my upper lip and it did not really \\&quot;hurt\\&quot;. IMO it felt just like tweezing, just more than one hair at a time.     I do think that the exfoliating helped with the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; and also in stopping the ingrown hairs and bumps that some people have experienced. I did use the wave to exfoliate and clean before I epilated, since it is gentle on my face and can be used daily. The key is to use a very light touch with the epilator and move in very small slooooowww circles around your face. This is not a quick process like shaving, this takes way more time but the results are worth it. I think I did it a little longer than most because to me it felt like a facial massage. The hair on my face is very much like peach fuzz though so this may be why it did not hurt me. I used a large table top mirror that has a magnifying mirror on one side and a plain mirror on the other and light up. I put on a homemade moisturizer when I was finished as I do nightly for the past week.     I am writing this the day after this process and my face did not break out nor do I have ingrown hairs, the hair is gone; my face is not red but is soft and smooth. For me this was a great experience and entrance into the world of epilating. I am looking into getting a better one for my legs and arms. I am getting ready to usethe [[ASIN:B0013ODP3G Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kit]] for some deep down cleaning.</li>
    <li> I got this epilator to try something new for my underarms. Shaving was getting aggravating with my insanely thick hair, and waxing wasn&#x27;t working for me. I tried this epilator the second the box hit my door step. I&#x27;m not going to lie.. it&#x27;s painful.. and I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, and there was some slight bleeding. But it works! I could only do seperate areas for just a few seconds, and although it didn&#x27;t pick up every hair, my underarms look much better than before. I can see myself using this for years to come. I assume it will get less painful and the hair will grow slower and thinner. The problems I have with it: It&#x27;s loud. Not like a soft little buzz.. No. It&#x27;s a very frightening noise. My roommates probably think I&#x27;m using a mini chainsaw. It&#x27;s pretty fun watching the hairs get plucked up and brushing them off the epilator makes you realize the progress. It works.. and it didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg! I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I cannot be without this item now that I have used it for awhile.....it works awesome and does not hurt at all. It makes it easy to get hairs that you didn&#x27;t know were there as well......which is pretty scary but that&#x27;s what I like about it....never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> It is likely to keep using it, maybe you can get used, but the truth is that this is quite uncomfortable, painful, the engine is too high a working party of revolution, and touches the skin, causing an unpleasant impression, and it only tested in the forearm.</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator and I bought it based off of the glowing reviews. I wish I could say good things but honestly, it&#x27;s not that great an epilator. I have tried it on my bikini area, underarms, and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs, my hair was too fine and it took forever (though it was my fault for expecting such a dinky thing to cover such a big area). The epilator basically cut my hair to stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini Area - It works especially in the nooks and crannies but it leaves a ton of red bumps in its wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms - I used it the most here. I have bumpy underarms to begin with and I&#x27;ve tried to smooth them with exfoliating and lotions after. The only thing that really works is tweezing but it takes forever and I always miss a few spots. So I thought epilating would help. It was very quick but the darned thing was very rough on my skin - at some points, it literally caught my skin and cut it! My hair is coarse and strong but it still left behind stubble and even worse a lot of red bumps and bleeding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I was really disappointed in this epilator. It was really rough on my skin and always left cuts or irritation while doing a messy job.</li>
    <li> Have spent many dollars before trying this product. It is painful when you first start using it but if you experiment holding it at different angles I have found that it is not painful at all. It last for about 7 days on my face and I have fast growing facial hair. I would highly recommend it. Even at first it is no more painful than waxing and saves lots of money!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. It gets rid of MOST of the hair, but not the stubborn ones; you&#x27;ll still have to use a tweezer to get at those. You also run a huge risk of getting ingrown hairs while using it... I mean it when I say huge. I saw my esthetician a few days after using it and she said that she could see numerous ingrown hairs becoming irritated on my chin and lip. It really is not that painful except when used on your upper lip. My eyes were watering while it was yanking the hairs out. To be honest, it feels like a ton of little tweezers pulling numerous hairs out at once (which is actually what&#x27;s happening). If you don&#x27;t like the sound of that, don&#x27;t buy it. Otherwise, I&#x27;d say proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to purchase this battery-operated unit because of the wide range of opinions on the product.  Then decided \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot; and ordered it.  I am so pleased that I did.  Sure it does not have the power for legs and such, but for underarms and the chin line it is perfect for me.  I highly recommend this because not only will you use it at home but you will not travel without it.  This is one of those items that I now cannot imagine being without.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Positives- small and easy to travel with, it actually plucks out hairs, easy to clean, and simple to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negatives- it takes a long time to pluck, its kinda painful when it plucks, the first time you go over an area it doesnt pluck out much, and it doesn&#x27;t pluck out much hair period&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this review of positive and negative things will help your decision.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product negative stars, I would. I&#x27;ve used epilators before, but never a mini. This one ripped my underarm hair out and left burning and red irritation marks that I had to hide for over a week until they healed. It runs poorly, which I think is part of the problem. If you&#x27;re ripping hair out by the roots, you want the shaver to be powerful and do it quickly. This one is terrible. WARNING: do not use on delicate areas.</li>
    <li> I have bought many of these.  They are reasonably priced and work well.  However I think I got one with an old blade last time as it did not work very well.  I will keep using them though.</li>
    <li> its super painful!!! but i must say it does get the job done... im sticking to waxing though...  this hurts too much!!</li>
    <li> At my age, by the time I get close enough to the mirror to \\&quot;see\\&quot; my whiskers, my eyesight is such than I cannot see them.........Voila!  This takes the necessity of vision away along with the unwanted hair.  Now when my hubby get close, he cannot see the whiskers either!!      First few uses, it had mild discomfort, now (several years later, am on my second one) it is no problem!</li>
    <li> Worked well, no complaints really. It Is slightly painful when used. But read directions to make sure and use properly</li>
    <li> I just tried my Emjoi AP-9L EPi Slim today and all I can say is...I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this. The hair over my upper lip is always an annoyance and waxing is painful AND takes off more than hair (ow!); this little item works BETTER than waxing with virtually no pain. My upper lip is so smooth and isn&#x27;t nearly as irritated as in my \\&quot;waxing past.\\&quot; Also used it on my under arms and it worked great!</li>
    <li> I got the courage to use it on my upper lip. It&#x27;s hurt a little bit and I had to go over and over the same spot before getting \\&quot;most\\&quot; of the hair out.    I am conflicted about whether I should give this epilator a 2 or 3 stars. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s THAT bad, especially with the price...but at the same time, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great.</li>
    <li> This actually works! I was a little skeptical, but the reviews convinced me that the Epi Slim would be a good buy. I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all. I will say that it does take a VERY long time. If you have a large area of hair to be removed, it could take hours. Also, if you&#x27;re buying this for use on \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas (i.e. bikini), it HURTS! It&#x27;s manageable if you have a high pain tolerance, but it&#x27;s definitely not a comfortable process. After the first regrowth, it was better, but still took some time because I had to repeatedly stop and start due to the pain. BEWARE OF INGROWN HAIRS! An after-wax/shave cream is essential. I recommend Bikini Zone Medicated Creme, but I&#x27;m sure plenty of anti-irritation products would do the trick.  Bottom line: For under $20, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the product because it removes hair fast. Before I bought this I was having so many problems removing all facial hair. I am disabled and its very easy for me to use. In addition, this hair remover does not cause much pain as it removes the hair. Its wonderful to feel beautiful and well groomed.</li>
    <li> This product runs on batteries and it can last for a reasonable period of time. It fits within the palm of your hands and therefore easier to grab and handle. In addition, its portability makes it convenient for travel usage.   It does remove the roots of the hair. This depends on the angulation of the blades to the surface of your skin, as well as, making sure the surface with the switch faces downwards. You may need to experiment with this angulation to ensure it is effective in what it does.   And for the cost of this product, I do recommend this highly.  It has been over a year and it is still functioning.</li>
    <li> I needed an epilator to get rid of facial fuzz. No one told me that once u get to menopause all sorts of things happen with facial hair. Not wanting to shave, I decided to try this little machine. It works a treat. I use this every three or four weeks and the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; seems to be nicely kept under control. My makeup goes on much smoother and I don&#x27;t have to worry when standing sideways in sunlight that my facial hair is visible. Bravo for a great product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my emoji epi slim, does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well but takes a really long time to remove all hairs from the underarm. (&amp;#62;10 minutes) To keep you underarms consistently smooth, you need to use this product at 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> This one is a great value. Don&#x27;t love the slight pain it causes (don&#x27;t worry you get used to it oddly enough) but works well and does exactly what you need it to. My wife uses this often.</li>
    <li> I guess the hair on my face has to be much longer in order for this to work.  I can&#x27;t go for a week or how ever long it takes for the hair to be long enough for this to work.  I let the hair on my face grow for at least 3 days and this didn&#x27;t remove any of them.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> This thing really works!!!!!!  it&#x27;s hurts a little at first but the more you do it, the less it hurts.  It really takes off all the hairs and I&#x27;ve found that as they grow back, they are not coming in very coarse or think at all!  I am so happy with this.  It works well and I recommend it to everyone I know!!</li>
    <li> I was supposed to use it for facial hair and I thought it would be a better alternative to tweezer but it&#x27;s not that great. It doesn&#x27;t grab hairs firmly and it breaks the hairs which ultimately turns into a pimple or ingrown.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t even comment about the pain- most of us that have used epliaters understand that it is literally ripping the hairs out of your body and with that comes some pain. Some folks can tolerate it, some can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now- for the actual product- the Emjoi Epi-Slim. I really like this little thing! It runs on 2 AA batteries and it seems to last a long time before needing new ones (I don&#x27;t use this everyday so that may be a reason that the batteries last as long as they do). It is the perfect size for getting into your underarm area, but -although it may just be me- it does take quite a few passes around the area in order to get all of the little hairs. It&#x27;s also great for the upper lip- the rounded shape of the top fits perfectly into the contours of the face. It&#x27;s definitely not powerful enough nor large enough to handle other areas such as your legs IMO, but for the price I truly don&#x27;t mind needing 2 separate epilaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all- this is a great little product although it&#x27;s use is limited since it will pretty much only handle underarms and lip.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. Easy to use with great results. My skin is a little red but no more than if I had razor burn.  I used this on my armpits and bikini line and I&#x27;m soooo happy. My first time epilating and I almost got every hair. Fyi, I have very dark, thick hair with light, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> When I got this in the mail I was excited cause it came real early, sooner then I expected, but when I used it I was not amazed with it, I used it on my lower leg near my ankle it HURT, then after I waited for few minuets I started to break out in a rash,it never burned or itched I just had a lot of little red dots all over the areas I went over with the razor. I will not use it on my bikini area, tried it once and it was not pulling the hairs like it was supposed it pulled my skin and made me bleed! I&#x27;m not really happy about it! When I used it it was very loud so I didn&#x27;t have privacy, it was loud enough to where everyone could hear! It&#x27;s embarrassing</li>
    <li> This thing is great!  I haven&#x27;t found any of the problems that others have reviewed.  It works great for removing hair in the hard to reach places.  It runs on 2 AA batteries and it has a lot of pulling power for such a small gizmo.  It is for smaller areas where you want to remove hair and where there are a lot of curves.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this product ,this product was not what I was looking for its painful an doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I got this about a week ago and i love it! it works better than i thought it would and compared to other epilators its super cheap!&lt;br /&gt;It is by no means meant for large areas but works great for smaller areas. It is pretty loud and you need to go over some spots several times in order to get all of the hair removed. You really cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> This does remove facial hair with a relative minimum of discomfort.  And the hair does remain mostly absent for 3-4 weeks following - so it is better than other methods of hair removal in that regard. Of course, I am looking for a completely painless method which only has to be done once!  Since I haven&#x27;t discovered that yet, this is probably the next best thing.</li>
    <li> im pretty pissed at myself for buying it.it doesnt work on coures hair.and after 3trys it doest work at all.  please save your money and dont purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. I read reviews and hoped it would work great for me since I have thick, coarse hair. All it did was rip the hairs! It didn&#x27;t even rip it OUT at the roots. I had to immediately go back and pluck everything it missed because it was becoming itchy from the stubs it created. This did not work on the bikini or under arm area for me.</li>
    <li> The Emoji Epi Slim works surprisingly well!  I bought this product to see how I liked epilators as I was looking at the Emjoi 18 Emagine.  I figured if I could handle this one, I may be able to handle the bigger one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is small, but feels like it pulls 50 hairs at a time!  I tried it on my arm first, just to experiment.  I moved the slim in small circles just as the instructions said and it cleared a spot on my arm from all hair!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this on your arms unless you trim the hair short first, but it worked for my experiment.  Next I used it on my upper lip.  At first, it did NOT feel good!  After a few seconds the pain is a lot more manageable and eventually just feels like a tickle on the spot you&#x27;re working on.  It&#x27;s like that for all areas, it hurst the worst in the first few seconds then it get a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try this on my bikini area...  We&#x27;ll see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think using this hurts less or equal to threading.  And for $15, well worth it!  Using it twice, it pays for itself if you think about how much facial threading or waxing would be, plus tip.  A great buy, and it arrived quickly.  I think I&#x27;ll get the Emagine after all :)</li>
    <li> The Emjoi removed hair as advertised.  Afterward, the skin is smooth, no bumps or irritation.  The only reason I gave four stars - it feels like tiny electrical shocks as it pulls out the hair. (if you&#x27;re new to this process you might be a little startled at first)  It&#x27;s probably unrealistic to expect pulling hair out at the root to be painless.</li>
    <li> Great product. Battery last a long time. Powerful yet small. If you are tight on money, this works just as good as the expensive versions, just covers less space at a time. 1 week after I used this on my face I had a horrible episode of ingrown hairs everywhere. I do not recommend for face.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have polycystic ovary syndrome, which means I would seriously grow a full beard if I didn&#x27;t take off that hair...and when I was a teen, I started shaving it. I never wanted anyone to know I had this problem...we&#x27;re not talking a few stray hairs to pluck, either. We&#x27;re talking DON JOHNSON. Anyway, after 30 yrs of shaving it off, and feeling self-conscious because my stubble would grow out within the day and it looked like gun powder residue...I couldn&#x27;t afford electrolysis and have tried all the remover products, which on daily-shaved skin are like atomic bombs, and bleaching just doesn&#x27;t cut it with a beard...you end up having moms chasing you thru the mall, wanting pictures of you with their kids on your knee. I HAD HEARD THAT EPILATORS WERE HORRENDOUSLY PAINFUL. Not my personal favorite thing, pain. So I never bought one...until I read the reviews on this one...and IT&#x27;S AWESOME!  Sure, it smarts when it is ripping out your hair by the tufts, but it&#x27;s only for a minute, ladies! My coloring is very light, and I tend toward reddish skin, so I expected to be beet-red after using it. NOPE, just a bit pinker than usual and it is just amazing. IF I&#x27;D HAVE KNOWN IT WAS THIS CHEAP, EASY AND RELATIVELY PAINLESS, I&#x27;D HAVE DONE THIS YEARS AGO. It isn&#x27;t pain-free, but it sure is a lot nicer to see and feel that smooth skin instead of velcro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It&#x27;s been going strong, daily, since I bought it in January &#x27;12, and no problems whatsoever! My only complaint, if I need one, is that it eats batteries. It has to have fresh batteries or it lags and won&#x27;t snag the hairs...the batteries can still be good for something else, but not for the Emjoi...however, if buying a pack of batteries every so often means having a smooth face, then I&#x27;m good. If it had a cord or the option of having a cord, or a cordless model, I&#x27;d buy that, too.</li>
    <li> i tired using this thing and it hurt bad. I tried using it on my top lip and jumped everytime I tried to use it. I jumped from the pain. Which is saying alot because I don&#x27;t jump when I get my eyebows plicked.</li>
    <li> Very painful. I followed the instructions and tied several times to use this product. It does state you will feel a stinging sensation that will go away after a few uses. It didn&#x27;t go away for me. My legs had tiny red dots all over them from the product yanking the root out. It did to well on that, if pain is beauty than it works well.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this only for my face and I love it. It works great. It does hurt but you are pulling hair out by the root so that&#x27;s understandable and the pain isn&#x27;t unbearable. The results last me awhile I only have to do this about once a month. i&#x27;m asian and have pretty fine hair on my face so I just wanted something that would help take that away. Great product!</li>
    <li> I used this epilator for my chin and upper lip and it worked really well. It&#x27;s a reasonable price and it catches almost every hair.  I&#x27;ve been plucking and waxing for years and this is so much faster, cleaner, and more efficient.  It didn&#x27;t get every hair, but it got most of them.  I tried it again the next day for a clean up and it got the others.  It really hurts (more on my upper lip than chin), but it&#x27;s not any more painful than plucking or waxing. All in all, I am very happy with it.  Tips: It works better, and surprisingly hurts less on shorter hair.  I recommend shaving, or buffing off the hair and waiting a couple days before using the epilator.</li>
    <li> Have one for years. So good that I bought two more for my mother and sister.  Easy to use and to travel with.  Does the job. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this on the recommendation of my hair stylist.  It works.  It&#x27;s aaaa-making.  Haven&#x27;t had to wax my face since I bought it!!!</li>
    <li> This machine is the worst thing they ever sold. It never worked and actually took skin off my FACE!!!! I have 5 scars ON MY FACE! You can actually notice them. I never had to wear cover up now I do and still  see the scars. I am irate, sad, upset. I mean come on, this is my face! I have tried everything the derma roller Other face machines the scars will not go away. Will need Botox to get rid of them DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> you have to hold the skin VERY taut or else it won&#x27;t work that well. but considering its size and price, it does its job pretty good. [i don&#x27;t use it for my face, i use it for the bikini area, legs, and armpit.]</li>
    <li> First of all, it misses a lot of tiny hairs.  Second, it hurts! I stopped using it after a couple of painful attempts.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Emjoi Compact Epilator that I purchased.  It does exactly what it claims to do and works wonderfully. Until I asked a salon for advice on the best way to remove unwanted facial hair, I didn&#x27;t even know something like this exhisted.  I just wish I would have known about this product years ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A. Davis &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This product does not do what it advertises. Does not work at all on my facial hair</li>
    <li> This product is great, and it arrived in good time in the described condition.</li>
    <li> This epilator is really good for facial hair.  I used to tweeze and it was so painful,this product is good and does the job in a jiffy and is travel friendly too! I have already recommended it to my friends and highly recommend it for purchase.</li>
    <li> It hurts but works great on the face and small areas.  Will also work great for travel.  I wish there was a way to do this without the pain.  It would also be nice if the plastic around the rotating tweasers could be taken apart to clean easier.</li>
    <li> The product does work, the problem is that with the pain that is expected it only pulls out three or four hairs in one pass. This means you have to pass over a single sight multiply times to see any results.</li>
    <li> My wife like it and uses it now and then. It does do what it says it will. I will have to ask my wife how she likes it.</li>
    <li> Love this thing, pulls out my chin hairs like nobodies business. I&#x27;d be a werewolf without it. also, I&#x27;ve had this thing for say about ten years and still going strong. Been pullin out my chin hairs for THAT LONG!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and it works fine.  You have to make sure your skin is taut or it will irritate your skin.  I have to go over the area a few times but maybe it&#x27;s because I just haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of it yet.</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well but its just too painful for me so i gave it to a friend of mine</li>
    <li> It takes more than one swipe over areas to get all the hair.  Use a light hand or it will leave burns on your skin.  Will  invest on a more effective epilator when the budget allows.  In the meantime, it does an acceptable job.  Have had much better.</li>
    <li> This product seems to really pull the hairs out but it is a little painful. I actually just bought it for facial hair and I can only do a little at a time...</li>
    <li> How can I return this garbage? or can i get a refund! smh&lt;br /&gt;IT IS PAINFUL!&lt;br /&gt;tried this on my leg and i could not even use it for a whole minute it hurts. It looks cheap and its painful. Don&#x27;t but, maybe invest in a NONO since I guess that what this product tried to imitate and didn&#x27;t come close!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I am thinking of sending this to my sister in India. I wonder if it will ship to India via amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a similar one I had for years.  I read somewhere you should never make your skin taut in order to shave but this requires you to do so.  I will see how it works on other parts labelled.</li>
    <li> I am leaving 5 stars because the product worked exactly as described. However, after using it, my face broke out worse than it ever has before. A word of warning to those with sensitive skin-- this depilator works very well, but this method of hair removal may still be too harsh for some.</li>
    <li> Really, people, did you expect this to be comfortable?  Did you think buying a machine that pulls your hairs out one by one is gonna feel like a gentle massage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device doesn&#x27;t feel good.  It feels terrible.  But my mustache is gone, and I&#x27;m thankful for that.  I take a couple ibuprophen before I do this, and I work my way in gently from the edge of my mustache, and don&#x27;t that keeps it from hurting too much all at once.  Tried it once in my armpits, though, and that basically will never happen again.</li>
    <li> After spending money every month for waxing and watching the endless line of tv ads for different products..I ended up on Amazon and looked through their variety of hair removal products.  After reading the reviews on this one, I took a chance and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problems with facial hair due to a hormone imbalance and have been going to a salon for waxing for years.  This item is small, fits nicely in your hand.  The directions for use are well laid out.  It is designed for small areas like your chin, &#x27;moustache&#x27; area, etc.  Not around the eyebrow area.  I am sure I could use it for other small areas but this is the area I am most interested in treating.  They explain the proper way to hold the device, the angle, logo facing you, etc.  When you first turn it on, the rotating head looks a little intimidating, have to say!  However, I found it didn&#x27;t hurt any more than having waxing done.  There is a little tingling afterwards for a few minutes. They suggest doing it in the evening, in case of any redness, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine is a little loud.  So if you are trying to be discrete and not let folks know what you are doing, they will assume you are using an electric razor..  I did let the hair grow a little for easier use. I did my moustache area this morning and was very pleased with the result.  Actually, I found it even picked up the peach fuzz on the side of my face quite well.  I imagine if I was to let the hair grow a little longer, I could do it all at once, but I was too impatient for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most about having this is the option to treat the hair at home, when I want to.  You know, you have an appointment booked for waxing in a few days and surprise, you get invited out and all you can think about is the hair you see on your face.  Now you can treat it the night before, and still be ready the next day.  The unit is small enough to easily fit in your overnight bag for travel too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see this being not only a time saver, but most certainly a money saver!</li>
    <li> A bit painfull for facial hair but its really good an maybe ill by another one cuz I haved used this one and the battery life is okay</li>
    <li> The size is pratical, but instead of pulling out the hair from the root, it just cuts them. One or two hair do get pulled out, but the rest are just there. It is cheap, but not worth it, buy a shaver instead.</li>
    <li> this product fits my lifestyle perfect. i think it does a wonderful job, but definitely for face, bikini and other small areas. if you are not use to waxing or tweezing the area you plan to use it on, then of course that area will be sensitive, and may be a bit painful, but if you already tweeze and wax, then it is not painful what so ever.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Epi Slim to get rid of the facial hair that seem to be increasing by the day since I turned 40, it works great! I can now wear my mineral makeup or creme makeup without the embarassing fuzzy look.  I tried it on my bikini but the pain was to much. I gave this product 4 stars because of the pain factor.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far, but believe it will perform exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product . This product is wounderful it meets and exceeds my hair removal needs, and I am very satisfied with this product , and I recommend this item over all my hair removal purchase&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I used it on my upper lip an it hurts me. It is painful and it does not remove the fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very good but it does not work.</li>
    <li> I love this produce no more razor burns or cuts...I had been using the smaller version but when I purchase this and I was able also remove the hair from my legs I was amazed. I will not lie you will feel some pulling of the hair but once you get use to it, it is nothing. I love it, oh and between time I use it is almost a month. I carry my Emjoi in my purse just in case.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it finally arrived in the mail. However, it doesn&#x27;t work. I bought new batteries and put them in there, but it still doesn&#x27;t work. The device is in new packaging too.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this hair remover.  It did not do what it said it would do and I&#x27;ve now resorted to paying for permanent laser hair removal.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Doesn&#x27;t hurt and continued use really shows a difference than plucking.notice that it takes longer for hair to grow back.</li>
    <li> I have owned this item for about 3 years.  It works very well on those pesky hairs above your upper lip.  I will not lie-it may bring tears to your eyes while using it but it is well worth it.  Use it twice &amp; it will have more than paid for itself if you wax your upper lip in a salon.  I have noticed that it is important to replace the batteries before you realize you should.  It will begin to rotate slower (even though by looking at it you cannot tell).  More painful when it begins to rotate slower.  Don&#x27;t wait for it to stop working.  I hope this item lasts forever!!</li>
    <li> Got this to just try and see if it would work for my mother.  She loves it!!!  I love it too, and plan to get another one for myself!  It works great!</li>
    <li> Extremely painful to use. Also a lot of hairs aren&#x27;t pulled, just &amp;#34;chopped&amp;#34; down. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this just because it&#x27;s so painful.</li>
    <li> this epilator works pretty damn well for the price.  i would def make this purchase again.  it came super fast and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> It hurts, but it works so the pain is worth it. Using some kind of numbing solution should help. I haven done that yet, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it is worth it because of the money I am saving on not having to wax my lip, chin and sideburns areas on my face. For the price, it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product a couple days ago.  I think this is an amazing product.  It works so well on my legs, bikini line, chin and upper lip.  I think it would be better if the discs moved faster, less stinging but for what it is, it work amazingly.  It removed my unwanted facial hair quickly and effectively.  I&#x27;d dare say it even works better than when I get waxed.  The noise is unnerving at first but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s harmless.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s one of the best purchases that I have done.  It is very fast, it hurts a little, but leaves the skin smooth. It&#x27;s fabulous, I recommended it to my sister and she loves too.</li>
    <li> I just hate that these things are so loud!!! uh they are so loud...serious weed whacker loud. How can anyone do some hair removal without the whole house knowing lol...anyways does work as it claims. They batteries I had drained quick. I honestly prefer plug in better. But definitely my legs have to be maintained far less by using these things. An important note be concious of the hair follical they direction you pull the hair out can determine where you get ingrown hairs or not. I know ehhhww. But yeah also EXFOLIATE.</li>
    <li> I recommend this for face and touch up. I own three different sizes for different purpose. Really glad and wished I had this year ago after waxing. Save $$$ and pays for itself.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s my hair but all it pretty much did was yank out a few hairs, pinch my skin, and cut the rest short. It also gave me red bumps on my legs like razor burn but it was worse. I had to tweeze out what ever ingrown hair I got from it, and shave the rest of my legs and bikini area because it had just left me all stubbly</li>
    <li> I love my Epi slim cosmetic hair remover.  It does a neat, clean job and doesn&#x27;t hurt!  This is my second Epi hair remover.  I had my original one for several years.  It is worth it!</li>
    <li> It definitely worked to pull out hair but it did break alot of the hairs instead of pulling them out. I probably won&#x27;t be using this again as I didn&#x27;t realize how sensitive my skin was, everywhere I used it was red and hot for 3 days after along with several small pimples! So if you have sensitive skin I&#x27;d go elsewhere but if your just doing a small area it should be fine!</li>
    <li> Love love love!  I just used this for the first time. I&#x27;m used to threading, but I can&#x27;t hop in the car and drive miles everytime my chin decides to sprout a beard! it WORKS! So worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times and it works great on those facial hairs that appear out of no where. I also tried in my bikini area, no irritation which is a huge plus. Small in size which is also a nice plus.</li>
    <li> Ok. This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used. I read most of the reviews before ordereing this product. I read the instructions very carefully. I even referenced youtube video&#x27;s. But when I first turned on the machine I got nervous. It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting. This little machine is powerful. It was a little uncomfortable until I got the swing of things. A little discomfort but you will be hair free ;).</li>
    <li> It just causes more hair to grow faster. It&#x27;s not really painful on the chin, but any other area and it hurts.</li>
    <li> Some success, but not sure on what to think yet.  Need more time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first use -seems like I have to use it daily for a month.</li>
    <li> a problem solver...great product!</li>
    <li> Loud and noisy.  Didn&#x27;t do a very good job of getting the hair off my chin.  I reread on how to use it and applied a little more pressure and was rewarded with a nice red bruise that stayed with me for about a week.  It was really very nice of my sister and BIL not to tease me about the &#x27;hicky&#x27; I got on my chin.  :(</li>
    <li> I bought this last week and it came in the mail exactly when it said would which wasn&#x27;t but four business days. This product does what it advertises it will do. Its not painless hair removal but its nothing you can withstand especially if you already wax.  To me to hurts less then waxing.  I recommend this everyone and anyone</li>
    <li> Use this daily to remove random neck and chin hairs.  It stings a little.  Like using tweezers, but faster.  Best solution I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> This thing is awful! it does not remove hair well at all and in fact, causing more irritation to the skin after use. It hurts and is not even a good remover. Hate it! Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> Works well and just what I thought I was getting. What more is there to say but I got what I ordered fast and was what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;M</li>
    <li> its very good thing, I&#x27;m satisfied with it. its doing its work very good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. price is good too</li>
    <li> First, its too noisy when using it near your face or ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, it didn&#x27;t work well removing hair, to make it worth using with the noise.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend to keep those stubborn chin hairs off. She carries it in her purse and it does the trick. She likes it.</li>
    <li> Didnt really work for me. Decided to just see an electrolysis to reduce my sideburns. Seek professional treatment if its in your budget. More effective</li>
    <li> When you turn this thing on it will jump you out of your shoes. There is no way anyone can use it. I bought it for my face and nope, I&#x27;m not doing that .. so I let the hair on my leg grow so that I could get a better feel for it. And NO .. no way am I gonna put this thing on any part of my body. I will save and get a more realistic item to remove the facial hair that taunt me and until then i will pluck which is heaven compared to the damage I think this item can cause</li>
    <li> Is good is fast not too painful better than the tweezers  is small perfect for traveling  looks nice is good</li>
    <li> i ordered the emjoi epilator with 72 tweezers along with this. i wrote a long review on the emjoi epilator. it is pretty much the same just smaller!!! :-D</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews before purchasing.  Pros: great size, appears well made,  works - but prepare yourself.  It is necessary to hold your skin taut and it is uncomfortable in the beginning.  But it does the job and leaves a smooth surface.  I am very light skinned.  I have very fine hairs, that are light blond, but I also have some stubborn, thick random dark/grey hairs in various places that are hard to get to.  I have only used in on my face and it did the job.  I have very sensitive skin, so I used it at night as suggested.  Not so red afterwards and just decreased any irritation by using lotion right after.  Cleaned it also as suggested as you can see that it does get the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - would be nice if it came with a carrying bag.  I found a nice soft cloth type eyeglass case bag fits it perfectly for taking on the road.  Noisy. Even holding skin taut - did have to go over areas in semi circular fashion a few times for it to grab it all, but it will do the job!</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of hair remover for years for both legs and face. This is very comfortable and will clear your upper lip in no time!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product and I have no intention of ever using it.This product could potentially pinch or grab my skin,leading to irritation and skin damage.The first few times that you use it,you are supposed to feel a prickling sensation.You have to consult a health care provider before using this product if you are menstruating,pregnant,have acne,saggy skin,moles,and so much more.I understand that no hair removal product is perfect but this hair remover should be considered a deadly weapon.When I put the batteries in and turned it on,it sounded and looked like a bunch of razor blades spinning at full speed.I do not recommend this product to anyone because there are just way to many precautions that you have to take before using it.Also you have to trim your hair first before using this product which in my opinion defeats the whole purpose of this product.</li>
    <li> I have one of these contraptions which is much smaller and very old and doesn&#x27;t do much.  I happened upon this new model on Amazon one day after tweezing in a magnifying mirror with my bifocals on.  Does that paint a pretty picture?  I can now throw out the small one, it&#x27;s too small to do anything but irritate anyhow.  Well, I bought this new Epi-Slim Hair Remover and it works very well.  I must have pulled a long hair from under my chin yesterday because it itched like the dickens which will remind me to use some witch hazel afterwards next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember 30 or 35 years or so in the long ago when all of us ladies were buying Epi-Lady to shave our legs.  That was an instrument of pure torture.  I will never do that again even though I see that they still sell the larger sizes made apparently for that purpose.  Better to have died as a small child than to have suffered that.</li>
    <li> My old Epilady died and I was getting desperate.  I bought it yesterday for around my mouth, chin and underarms, and other areas I don&#x27;t want to admit to.  It didn&#x27;t work as well on my underarms (skin&#x27;s too saggy, not the appliance&#x27;s fault, mine). So I need to check into another product for the softer sides of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the lips, chin, and any places curved, but fairly firm, it was great!  My upper lip is completly bare for the first time in over 25 years! without creams (smelly!!!!), or 2 hours of plucking (and then only half of the hairs would be gone). I had some redness for about an hour (same with the plucking), but no hand-cramps!  It was a little noisy, but not bad.  There was a cleaning brush included, and a little cap to put on when I was done, so it doesn&#x27;t need a separate travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a couple of hairs I didn&#x27;t try to use it on (too close to the nostrils), and a couple of bristles this morning (same as with plucking), but far fewer.  I also noticed a lot!!!! more roots on the hairs in the machine than I would see from plucking, so the machine pulls with a lot of power, which means fewer hairs will grow back.  Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it the first time took all of 5 minutes, so I&#x27;m certainly not going to complain about that.  (It took longer to find fresh batteries in the fridge.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in the day, I was so curious (and happy to have smooth lips again), I got brave, and tried on my knuckles, toes, feet, ankles, knees, wrists and even my legs in spots.  (I had the Epilady 10 years and never got that brave.)  It&#x27;s too small to go after my legs, but until I get a larger one, I think it&#x27;ll be good for places I miss shaving.</li>
    <li> I tried replacing the batteries, following all the instructions in the manual to get it working, but it was of no use. Buying this product will clearly be a bad investment on your part. I had discarded the product item cover and tag as soon as I received it,so I had no way of replacing this product with a new one. I would suggest to look for a better safe guaranteed alternative and not choose this product.</li>
    <li> Seems alright, it&#x27;s loud and I was hesitant to put this against my face, but I did. It pulls okay, might have to go around a few times. GET 2 AA Batteries!!!!!! I didn&#x27;t realize this took batteries until it arrived, I was under the impression it charged or something... It does not! Great travel size. Great for coarse hair, the thin/light hair will seemed to be &#x27;clipped&#x27; rather than twee-zed. Only complaint is the loudness of it, this is my first product like this, so I&#x27;m not sure if they are all like this. I&#x27;m use to twee-zing and waxing so this don&#x27;t phase me any.. however if you are new to twee-zing or removing hairs.. this is going to hurt until you get use to it. I have not used it under my arms.. I&#x27;ll stick to a razor there... and it is too big to maneuver around eye brows. I still like my twist and tweeze though :)</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t remove any hair so i tried it several times which put big scars on my upper lip area. This is an absolute waste of money. I bought it as it was the cheapest in the market but there is a reason that you should trust known brands.</li>
    <li> This razor workks great for me on my face.  It does putt the hair out so it does hurt, but once you get going is does a good job of removing hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I would survive now without this little device! I use this everyday for several areas. Its a gem.</li>
    <li> I would kindly appreciate my full refund!. This epi slim hair remover is just insulting to me. It CANNOT remove one hair despite going over the area over, and over and over again. I read the directions 2x to make sure I was working it properly. It CANNOT remove hair on my leg, it CANNOT remove hair under my arm, it CANNOT remove hair in my bikini area whether the hair is very thin, very short, a little long or whatsoever length. I am exceedingly disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work but after a few months, the hair wasn&#x27;t removed anymore. I cleaned faithfully after each use but it just stopped doing what it should. There has to be something better on the market - this just isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> It hurts way less than waxing &amp; plucking, &amp; its so much faster! The only thing, if you&#x27;re going to use it on your sideburns, it is going to hurt at first, but that will calm down the more you do it. Just make sure to clean &amp; exfoliate before hand &amp; possibly ice up the area, it reduces the pain &amp; redness afterwards.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year now, and it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m a petite person, so the size of this epilator is perfect for me. It takes about 30 seconds to get rid of my underarm hair, so it takes much less time than waxing and the hair comes back slower than shaving. It does leave a few strays behind, but I just get those with a tweezer.</li>
    <li> I considered many different Hair Removers but decided on this one. I need something to remove the difficult to remove dark hairs on my face. This does hurts, but eventually it does work to eliminate the hairs.</li>
    <li> It really works bye to chin hair</li>
    <li> The Emjoi Slim Hair Remover works wonderfully for the areas that I use it.  I recommend it very much for hair removal.</li>
    <li> great product it got here on time and tweezes all the hairs it works pretty fast and came with everything that it includes id rather use this than wax</li>
    <li> Does not do a good job!!!!!! I go over and over the hair on my face and still pluck it out!!!!</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all! it would not work no matter how many times I changed the batteries or anything.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very comfortabe good value and quiet to use in  private doe not leave your skin red like others</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say when I tried it on my facial hairs, it was too rough.  I&#x27;ve tried it only once. I expected it to be soft for facial hair. I think it should be returned. Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Eva</li>
    <li> I already had a Braun Silk Epilator, you know the pink one, and works great on legs, but it was troublesome for bikini and face, so I bought this one on ebay for about $8 new, and works great on my face, I use it for my chin that was giving me a lot of trouble and I also have used it for my underarms. All in all I would recommend it.Plus is small enough to take with you anywere.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my Emjoi. It pulls out the hair with minimal pain (the upper lip is the worst), and it doesn&#x27;t grow back for at least a couple of weeks. It was well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Trusting the mostly favorable reviews, I bought this product since facial hair is a problem for me. Although the product can epilate fairly well, quality control and design are bad. The tweezers do not have a protective cap like in most body epiltors (Braun Silkepil, or Epilady). This causes the tweezers to sometimes dangerously come in contact with the skin and cause injury. The instructions say that the unit has to be held exactly at 90 degrees, but that is a ridiculous expectation from an user. The epilator head should be able to move according to the contour of one&#x27;s skin. The tweezers get very hot in a few minutes. I was injured by the tweezers, and now I permanently have a scar. I have a body epilator from Silkepil and it is so safe, excellent quality control.The newer ones come with a head attachment for facial hair. Go for those instead or something similar from another company. The extra money is worth it. I wish I had never used this epilator, my face would be scar-free.</li>
    <li> Wife is scared to use it</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver! I am a 19 year old female, I grow dark hair over my upper lip. I have bleached the hair, burned the hair off with creamers and shaved it before. The Emoji Epi Slim takes a few times to get used to because it can be painful, but the results are worth it for only having to use it on the face for 2 minutes or less. Also my upper lip hair grows back very slowly now. It is to the point where I only have to use my Epi Slim once a month and I have probably used this item a total of less than 8 times. Changed the batteries only once since I have had it for almost 8 months and it still works good as new. I love it!</li>
    <li> With its 9 tweezers, its only good for people with really sparse/thin hairs. Or facial hairs</li>
    <li> Loved it would recommend it to everyone.  Have to go over the area a few times but by far my best option for upper lip and chin.  Wished I&#x27;d tried it along time ago.  Ordering another for just in case.</li>
    <li> I use this constantly. It takes getting used to but is effective, handy and an inexpensive tool.</li>
    <li> I worked fine to me. I use it for the face, it is some pain but is normal.. If the hair is thick is not good idea to use this product.</li>
    <li> Great epilator!!! This is my 4th one and it is by far the best for hair removal anywhere, travel, and keeping clean.</li>
    <li> Removes fine hairs.  It does take time to get used to the pulling hair pain.  I have used this several times.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Would not work.</li>
    <li> It dosent work well I cant figure out how to clean it even with directions I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am not used to waxing but I do pluck stray hairs with tweezers when needed.  This looked like a cool tool.  The product does exactly like it says it will do, pluck unwanted hairs.  I have fair sensitive skin and the first time I used I was covered in red bumps that lasted a full week (some reviewers say 12-24hrs).  And it is was pretty painful the first few strokes but then under my chin got used to it.  After waiting a week for bumps to go away, I used it again, bumps came back for another week.  Not an attractive look, the hair was less obvious, lol.  The product does work which is why I give it 5 stars.  My skin just did not appreciate the abuse.  Happy tweezing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item only to find out that It does not work!&lt;br /&gt;It didnt pull out the hair in any kind of way!&lt;br /&gt;I tried every way in the damn handbook and NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helped. PLEASE dont order.</li>
    <li> This an electric tweezers. It&#x27;s faster than tweeting individual hair. Initially it can be a cause slight discomfort. It doesn&#x27;t grip hair that is too short. But you skin remains smooth. Doesn&#x27;t look or feel like it was &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Came without instructions, so it hasn&#x27;t been used yet.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for me and my mother.  She is 84, and had been using harsh chemicals to get rid of the little bit of white fuzz she has on her cheeks.  This works perfectly, and is fast, easy, and painless.  Uses regular batteries.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Works well but hurts so bad to use!</li>
    <li> my second one. as i like it. it does the job and my hair is pretty thick on my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I  always had to remove my facial hair every day either by creams or razor (big mistake).  Those never removed my hair completely and the regrowth was thicker!  I  was at my wits end trying to find a solution that would not burn my skin, so I did some searching and found this product.  I was skeptical at first but decided to try it based on the reviews.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!  It absolutely does the job and best of all my skin is soft again.  The first couple of times hurt a little (a pinch, nothing severe) but afterwards the &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; is less painful.  I only have to use this twice a week!  I definitely recommend this product in lieu of laser treatment, lotions or razors.  I tried them all but laser is too expensive and the other two only burned and damaged my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my lip for over a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong! Emjoi makes excellent epilators and this one is no different! It&#x27;s small and perfect for travel because it&#x27;s battery operated. It&#x27;s also perfect for your bikini area if you can get past the pain. Love it!</li>
    <li> This thing hurts. There is no other way to say it. If you are into pain then by all means buy it. It hurts when hairs are pulled out of your body. I still tweeze hairs on my face and that does not hurt half as much as this Emjoi does. Use a razor.</li>
    <li> This is ideal for underarms, knees, and bikini area.  What a great piece to travel with.  Does the job with little fuss.</li>
    <li> Well, it does what it says it will do. It removes the hair for a couple of weeks. Be prepared for a little pulling pain. There goes the saying \\&quot;no pain - no gain\\&quot; I am not sorry I bought it and the price is so reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is a necessity for me and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Hurts, but with pulling skin tight I can stand it. It works, but now I&#x27;m looking for something that dosn&#x27;t rip or tear my hairs out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this exact epilator for 3 years and am very satisfied with it in removing unwanted facial hair.  I just ordered a second one so I have one at my winter home and one at my summer home.  I would strongly recommend this product, as well as Amazon.com, through which I ordered this second epilator.</li>
    <li> Very effective epilator, purchased as a requested gift for family member, who is very pleased with it. Price is reasonable and product was received promptly.</li>
    <li> The Epi slim works great.  I bought 2 at Christmas time for gifts.  Unfortunately I did not buy them from Amazon.  When I found out Amazon had them at a much lower price, I bought one from Amazon.  My aesthetician told me she had one and that&#x27;s how I learned about Epi Slim.  It hurts a little at first, but after a while it feels fine.</li>
    <li> I initially got this for my underarms, because my regular razor just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. And yes this epilator works so much better than my regular razor, especially for the underarms area! And yes it is painful, but MY ADVICE **use this immediately after you shower/take a bath!!!** Epilating after a hot shower makes it sooo much more tolerable. I&#x27;ve started to use it on my legs too, and I like how it take much longer for my hair to grow back, and when it does, the hair does not stand out as much!</li>
    <li> As with any type of tweezing/plucking/waxing hair removal, there is going to be pain &amp; the Epi Slim is no different. This little battery powered epilator works so much better than I even anticipated. I&#x27;m a guy and purchased this to use on my tummy/chest/arm pits and I tried it on my tummy hair today and it worked like a charm, albeit with quite a bit of pain. Epilators are not for the faint of heart, and if you have never witnessed plucking or waxing, I would stay away because it definitely hurts. I&#x27;m excited to keep using this product and see if it keeps the hair away longer. My skin is super soft on first use, which is exactly what I wanted. My advice is to use it little by little. By that I mean do little areas at a time, not the entire area (on the first go anyway). I love this product though, and would recommend it to anyone who wants an affordable alternative way of hair removal.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase of the Emjoi epilator.  It was my first experience with an epilator, and I bought it primarily to remove hair from my neck, chin and upper lip.  I get these areas threaded every few weeks.  However, now that I am pregnant, I am finding that the hair grows more rapidly than before.  It costs about $30 every time I go to get threaded (I usually have my brows done, too).  I have been trying to find a way to take care of the lip, chin and neck myself, to save some money.  I tried home wax kits, and found that for some reason, the wax wouldn&#x27;t stick to most of the hairs on my neck.  Tweezing takes forever.  Shaving is not going to happen, because I am prone to ingrown hairs, and not interested in having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  So, this is what brought me to the epilator.      I was afraid that the epilator would hurt.  It looks like a torture device.  I was pleasantly surprised!    First of all, if you are having any part of your face threaded, you know that it is the most painful method of hair removal ever devised.  It hurts WAY more than waxing, and it takes longer too, as they have to make several passes over the same swatch of skin.  In particular, the bit of fuzz in the center of your upper lip is the most painful to remove.  The threading process actually causes me to break out into a sweat.  The first time I got threaded, I thought that I was bleeding.  I am more used to it now.  I go to this salon because the woman does an amazing job on my eyebrows (thanks to her, I could be an eyebrow model, if such a thing even exists).  Anyway, I digress.  The point is, epilating my lip, neck and chin did not hurt at all.  I am so used to pain from the hair removal process, that it didn&#x27;t even register.  I was elated.      Also, epilating appears to be pretty effective.  It took a few passes to get the hair out, and then there were maybe 4-5 that I had to get with a pair of tweezers.  But, I have to say, it was WAY better than trying to tweeze the whole mess.  Plus, I found that epilating takes cares of the small, fine hairs completely, in a way that tweezing does not (usually, when I tweeze, I can only get the obvious, coarse hairs).      So, I recommend this product.  I purchased it because it was cheap and small, and I only wanted to use it on limited areas.  It was a low-risk purchase.  Now, I have to say, I am so happy with the epilator I bought, that I may buy a larger model and give doing my legs a try.      The only CON: when I pressed against the skin, trying to get a tricky hair out, the rotating part slowed down, and the epilator was not effective.  It just doesn&#x27;t have that much power.  Maybe you don&#x27;t need it, but I think that the bigger models may be more efficient.  I did find that I needed to go over the same spot several times before it would catch the hairs.  I was hoping it would be a faster process.  I can&#x27;t say whether it was this product or not, maybe it is an issue common to all epilators.  However, I suspect that a larger, more expensive model may offer more RPMs, and may do the job quickly and more thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Pulled hair...hurt...what can I say but ouch and still had hair!!  Don&#x27;t buy as it will be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> hurts not worth it small will take for ever to take off any and everything and it hurts so you wouldn&#x27;t even be able to finish ..  just get waxed once a month until the hair takes long and longer to grow back followed by a hair prevention lotion like kalo hair removal to make it stop growing or something</li>
    <li> good to use and very comforable in handling not much irritation and value added product customer satisfied ,can take anywhere.</li>
    <li> Bought one &amp; then another.. that says it all</li>
    <li> All I can say is: ouch</li>
    <li> Does the job but hurts like heck. Of course. As long as youre prepared for the pain then I guess its a good product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I received one that didn&#x27;t work at all, I returned it to the seller, they were quick to send me another one and that one didn&#x27;t work either.  I was so disappointed.  This product has really great reviews and I was really looking forward to trying it.  I used brand new Duracell batteries and neither one of the Emjol&#x27;s even turned on.  I&#x27;m really bumbed, so wanted to use this.  I ended up just asking for a refund.</li>
    <li> Be careful.  I did not realize this was going to tweeze the hair out.  The pulling motion is painful.  It works well, just hurts.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m self conscious of my arm hair. It took the hair right out painlessly but I had to go over the same area a few times over. I think it&#x27;s because my hairs are very fine on my arms but it took like 90% of the hair out. I tried using this on my armpits, but it hurt too much and I wasn&#x27;t able to pull my skin taunt enough for it to effectively pull the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my abdomen, which is a bit hairy too. Wow, can&#x27;t believe I just wrote that but I&#x27;m writing it so my fellow Latinas, or anyone with dark course hair, will know it&#x27;s great for that too. I have yet to try it on my legs but I am expecting good results.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I gave this little machine a try; it makes life easier, doing what it does so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose it for use on my upper lip and the sides of my face. The Emjoi Epi Slim removes all of the fine downy hair, leaving my skin oh so baby smooth. Note that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the pain factor that &#x27;newbies&#x27; tend to experience as I previously tweezed (tedious) and then graduated to epilating with one of those hand held springs (worked well except for certain angles) for a couple of years prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light pressure with the Epi Slim in a circular motion and going over the area until I cannot feel any more &#x27;pulling&#x27; lets me know that I have gotten it all and can move on. Note that this is not an electric razor, but rather an epilator, so having to go over an area numerous times is just par for the course. I do have a few coarse post-menapausal hairs that don&#x27;t seem to get caught up and have to be hand tweezed, but as it&#x27;s just a few, it only takes a few secs to take care, so no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read so many reviews about using it on the under arm area but not having ever done anything but shave, I was very reluctant to venture there, to say the least. However, I finally gave it a go and whoa! I will never go back to shaving my under arms again! It did not hurt like I had feared it would and, again, I am left with baby soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Emjoi Epi Slim&#x27;s small manageable size and while I can imagine wanting something larger for a larger area such as the legs, this is perfect for where I use it. I really like the small price I paid for this little dynamo, and am so glad I gave it a go!</li>
    <li> NEVER worked. Came before thanksgiving, never to open it until after the return date. Opened it and realized it was broken. NEVER worked. Thought it was the batteries - it wasn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> If your skin is tender or sensitive, DONT buy this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a gift for my girldfriend, you inmediatly use it on her face(upper lip area).. and the day after, she got an awfull skin burn that took 2 weeks to fully heal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was horrible and painful, and now we hate this product, what a waste of 20 bucks</li>
    <li> I use it only under my arms, and it does the job. It only hurts a little the first time, since all of the hairs are being plucked out at the same time. After that, the hairs grow in at varying intervals, so every time it is used, fewer hairs are being removed at the same time. The trick is to use it every time just a few hairs are visible. I now longer have stubbles!</li>
    <li> This is my first time exfoliating and I never used tweezers before. That being said, it hurts. I tried it on my neck first. It took care of that issue I have right away so I got over the pain. I then went to my chin. It worked as well but hurts. I got enough courage to try the hair under my lip.I let it touch a small area under my lip lightly for a quick second. That little spot hurt and it turned red with a little bump. Of course I did not continue. My skin is just too sensitive in that area. I plan to just use it on my neck and chin.&lt;br /&gt;Oh. I read other reviews so I remembered to clean my face with alcohol before during and after use. Also I didnt moisturize until morning. It hurt all night but in the morning I was good to go! I hope it continues to work for me.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my step mother who has a lot of facial hair due to aging. She has been tweezing her face and neck and she said this was a life saver.  They do wear out after only 6 months but she asked me for another one. She didn&#x27;t want a different one, just the same one. It works.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be ineffective for hair removal. I have tried several different epilatory products however, they have all simply been a waste of my hard earned cash.</li>
    <li> Kind of scary to use the first time, honestly. The first couple of times it does sting a bit, but it can take care of so much, so quickly, and it finds hairs you just can&#x27;t see no matter what light you are using.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Hairs are still there. It&#x27;s back to plucking for me.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this little guy!  Since I have become OLD, the hair on my face seems to grow at the speed of sound!  Shaving just makes stubble, and that isn&#x27;t my idea of attractive.  This method actually removes the hair at the root so it doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast and when it does the hair is much softer.  It IS something you have to get used to.  The first time you use it ,you think you are pulling your face off, but eventually you get used to it.  Just takes a little time. DON&#x27;T GIVE UP!</li>
    <li> I have dark, thick, black armpit hair which is absolutely horrible. It also doesn&#x27;t help that my skin is slightly on the fairer side. And summer was also approaching, so I decided to get an epilator. When I got this product, I was so excited to use it. I read the instructions, inserted batteries, but then it would work. I took the batteries out and looked inside. One of the springs was broken. I contacted customer service, and they sent me another one free of charge! My pain tolerance is quite low, so it took me a long time to do each armpit. About thirty minutes I think. Although it hurt a lot, I was very pleased with the results and have been using this epilator ever since.</li>
    <li> This product definitely does a great job and you can&#x27;t beat the price. This is the first epilator that I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Okay, I got my epilator today and I was so excited! (Gross side note: I tried to grow out my underarm hair a little for about 2 days to make sure I could use the epilator immediately) So I opened up the box and I was very surprised by the size. I was expecting it to be a little bigger but that really does not bother me because I bought it for hair removal and not the size.   I read the instructions and it advised to use the epilator on the back of your hand. I totally recommend this to anyone who is new to an epilator. It gets you prepped for the feeling.  So after that I decided it was time to use it on my underarms. I must admit I was very nervous about the pain. I am also not going to lie, it does hurt and I don&#x27;t think that should be unexpected. Like some people have said, if you have ever waxed then you should be somewhat familiar with the pain. It is not terrible though and if you just think about the fact that you will have no hair afterwards, you should be fine. Keep your eye on the prize!   I would say that it did not take too much time to get rid of the hair. I would agree with others and say that it will not get rid of every single hair but it definitely gets rid of the majority and you can pluck out the rest if it really bothers you. My underarms are really smooth now and there is not \\&quot;5 o&#x27; clock shadow syndrome\\&quot; and I&#x27;m sold with epilating.   I also tried epilating my arms and I think that because this epilator is small and more for touch ups, it will take a longer time with removal but I am satisfied.  Overall, I would say that this epilator is great for a first time user given it&#x27;s price and that epilating is not for everyone so this is a good tester.  I do plan on eventually investing in a more expensive epilator but if you&#x27;re wary about them, definitely try this one out!</li>
    <li> First off, I LOVE this product. I thought I was going to be stuck with embarrassing hair growth for the rest of my life, having to constantly wax and tweeze. It is truly embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a whim. I had never heard of an Epilator. It was pretty cheap, so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose, especially since there were some good reviews about it. Now, I&#x27;m a girl and I have sideburns, a hairy chin, and hair by my belly button. I had recently resorted to waxing, which wasn&#x27;t so bad...but so time consuming. This thing works wonders. It is easy to use, and generally gets all the hair. The area stays smooth for quite a while. I was only using it on my stomach and chin, then I figured I would see if it worked on my sideburns. I would suggest making sure that no long hair from your head is near the epilator...pull it back tight, and make sure to pull up on the skin by your ear. At first, I got quite a bit of little red bumps. My solution was to put moisturizer or lotion, and it helped a lot with the red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I would definitely suggest this product to any woman who is having problems with embarrassing hair. This will help a lot, and it is quite fast. Only takes seconds! And it really isn&#x27;t very painful. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift for my daughter and it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m pretty sure she threw the original pkg away and now I&#x27;m at a loss of what to do. Brand new never been used....</li>
    <li> I got this just to try out an epilator for the first time. I figure $20 would be too much of a waste if I didn&#x27;t like it. I absolutely love it. Even though it can take a while, it&#x27;s still much less messy than waxing yourself, definitely cheaper than paying someone else to do it for you. I&#x27;ve been pretty much using it on everything: armpits, legs, even finer hair like arms and belly. It doesn&#x27;t always pick up 100%, but it just takes a little patience and some practice learning how to change angles and stuff. It leaves you much smoother than shaving (I hate the next-day stubble). As for pain, I think it&#x27;s better than  waxing because I always feel as if waxing takes off a layer of skin. With the Emjoi epilator, it takes a little longer, but you can take some breaks and come back to it if you feel like it&#x27;s too painful, without worrying about your wax cooling down. And my skin is definitely less irritated. I have very very coarse hair so waxing sometimes makes me bleed (especially if the length is not perfect), but the epilator picks up a wide range of lengths great.   I love the portability, though I think my next investment will be for one of the bigger ones, to cut down on the time, but this will be great for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time epilator user and I used this on my underarms. Here are a few main points    1.  It grabs only 4 or 5 hair at a time. The stinging sensation is there but not tear inducing for me since I have plucked before.    2.  Some hair gets cut instead of plucked.    3.  I had to go over the same spot several times before the area is relatively hair free    4.  It does make the noisy saw sound, but I don&#x27;t mind it much.    5.  Some of the really short hair (1 mm) will not get plucked.    I will continue to use this because I don&#x27;t think I am ready to have more than 4 hair plucked at a time (by bigger epilators)</li>
    <li> I just got this and immediately put it to test. At first I was a little thrown off by the noise of the epilator...it is not soft, comforting or feminine in anyway. I felt that it was going to rip my skin off, but to my surprise it worked wonderfully. I am used to threading and this is much, much less painful. Now my upper lip is smooth and clean. Best purchase ever.</li>
    <li> I was wanting to get something because I was new to the world of shaving/epilating/tweezing, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $50.  Read the reviews and I ultimately went with the Emoji Slim and it is amazing.  Its nothing but incredible.  I highly recommend it.  Of course there is paid, but its expected you are literally tweezing out your hair at rapid speed.</li>
    <li> Was bought by my wife. She has PCOS so unwanted hair from  hirsutism is a bid deal for her. It took a few sessions to start seeing results and to get used to the pain involved. But it does work on the thicker darker hairs better than any other epilator she&#x27;s ever purchased. She does still have some issues with ingrown hairs afterwards, but nothing like from waxing or shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is pretty decent. She&#x27;s been using it every other day for the past month and hasn&#x27;t had to replace them yet.</li>
    <li> I tried using it once.  It hurts!  I will try it again and will learn how to use it the right way.</li>
    <li> I like the larger emulator better.</li>
    <li> Good product, but work so bad!!. I used this only one time and put to side, it pull my hair like pull the grass.&lt;br /&gt;so so hurt!!! may be work for some body but not Me!</li>
    <li> Ok, This is one of those Products I should have had A Loooooooong Time ago. Now, lucky for me, I am a redhead and the hairs i have had on my face since 40, have been  very light. This year I turned  fifty  and recently noticed some darker annoying  hairs. I&#x27;ve been a plucking,like crazy, cause, My motto is,  Guys shouldn&#x27;t have boobs and girls should have beards……Haha…..This Tool works very well for Feminine facial needs. It is  Very compact, and very easy to use. Hurt?….Only if you hold wrong, or your just a big fat baby, HaHa….Seriously, Its going to prickle a little, and that&#x27;s to be expected.  I find it almost Too Good to be true and that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars, cause I can&#x27;t help but wonder….Is it going t break easy or what?. ..I hope I&#x27;m wrong about &amp;#34;The Wonder&amp;#34;, cause this Thing is &amp;#34;Wonderful&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I recently bought this Emjoi AP-9L, and the Emjoi dual head ... I Love the dual head for my legs, but I was not impressed with the cosmetic hair remover - as non of my hair was removed.  I found it to ineffective for me.</li>
    <li> Works well enough. Used to remove some shoulder / back hair. Would buy again. Not likely a good option for fine hair removal.</li>
    <li> Works very well... It is painful though... I have had great success using it after a hot shower... Less pain. Pleased I took a chance on it.</li>
    <li> Este producto es bueno para el pelo corto y fino, es doloroso al principio (sobre todo en areas muy sencibles) con el uso va desapareciendo la sensacion. Es facil de usar y tiene un tamaño muy practico.</li>
    <li> This product has reduced my need to shave my armpits and taken care of my facial hair with ease. I am not used to using this type of product, so I definitely jumped the first couple of times using it as it does hurt a bit at first; however, I now only use it once a week, and I&#x27;ve had the product just about a month. Comparing it to daily shaving, it saves me time and razor burn, not to mention what it did for the feminine mustache that was on my face before. I had very little reddening of the face (almost no change whatsoever), but I was red for the under arm for about a day or so. Not bad.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I did not get this thing sooner! I struggle with a facial hair problem and like many other women I have had to shell out lots of money on waxing or dipilitory creams. The waxing can get expensive and the creams are not much better than shaving. I started doing my own waxing but even that was messy and would break out my skin or even worse...pull off a layer of skin! YIKES! One at home wax kit costs as much as this Epi Slim and the Epi Slim does not have to be replaced every few weeks. I have read other comments on here that say that it will hurt a bit if you are not used to hair removal. I have LOTS of experience with hair removal on my face and I can say that, for me at least, this does not hurt at all. The lip area is a bit sensitive though. This is my new favorite appliance and I am so happy that I finally got it. I would definately reccomend this product to any woman that is looking for a better solution for hair removal. It gets the thick hairs and the thin hairs.</li>
    <li> Great product. Best used for facial hair. After using it, you may have to go back in with tweezers for a few hairs but not for much. I noticed that after using this hair remover, hair does grow back slower and finer. I had purchased a similar model but same brand over 7 years ago and it had stopped working after a while so hopefully this one will last longer. Like other epi&#x27;s it does hurt because it pulls out hair from the root but it&#x27;s only temporary and it&#x27;s worth it. :)</li>
    <li> Really like this product!  Use it for upper lip hair which is light and fine on me but still noticeable.  You have to get used to the hairs being tugged out, but I can put up with that to have it do its work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this device in lieu of getting waxed. Have to&lt;br /&gt;admit that it really does hurt, but probably not any more than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like there is less trauma to the skin when I use the Epi Slim.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I have giving it 4 stars vs. 5 is that it HURTS.</li>
    <li> Pain, pain and more pain. Until you finally, blissfully go numb, that is. But if you want to be hairless for a couple of weeks instead of just a day or two...that&#x27;s the price to paid! This little guy works really well and is easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing little thing that is slick and easy to use, and does a great job.  The 1st time stung like crazy as you would expect, but I use 2-3 times a week and just love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair removal I&#x27;ve had. The bigger ones are not as good.&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair quickly, great for small areas. It&#x27;s also great for legs, but have in mind that it&#x27;ll take a long time, depending on how much hair you have.&lt;br /&gt;It works for the face, however, I get a small rash after using it, be aware not every one is the same, but if your skin is very sensitive you might get something.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything for my face or not. Part of me wants to invest in an at-home hair removal laser when it comes to devices like this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit pain for first-timer. But the hair grow slower after I shave it, and I guess it can last one weeks?&lt;br /&gt;And the new-grown hair are much thinner than before.</li>
    <li> it is a bit crude,pulls hair at times</li>
    <li> love it. tolerable pain level</li>
    <li> Only for those who have been using Epilators as they know the slight pain involved in epilating process. Other than that, its an excellent product and works as promised.</li>
    <li> Yes it  makes a loud noise and yes it kinda hurts. But it works really good. Ive done facial hair and bikini line so far. It took me 2 days to do the bikini line. I couldn&#x27;t take that much pain in one night. Im sure it wont hurt as bad the more i use it. Overall im glad i finally bought it.</li>
    <li> I use it on my armpits.  It&#x27;s a good travel size and it&#x27;s easy to hold.  It misses hairs so you have to be patient with it,  but it&#x27;s better than a razor.</li>
    <li> As a product, this is great. It works great, but it is still painful. Doesn&#x27;t waste batteries, and it&#x27;s cordless, so no mess like wax, but it doesn&#x27;t remove hair as good as wax does. Sometimes it cuts hair instead of removing it from the root, as all epilators do. Good purchase for the price</li>
    <li> I have owned Epilady models in the past and took a chance on this little guy, on a whim.  Wow !!  For its size, I prefer it over the cheaply made Epilady larger model.  The size, though descreet, is easy to hold and maneuver over my skin and not too noisy, either.  I believe that for my  money, it is well worth it, and will last quite a while.  Seems to be made very well !!</li>
    <li> I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS PRODUCT. I AM 56 YEARS OLD FEMALE. I HAVE USE THE TWEEZIES INTHE PAST, AND I READ THE REVIEWS ON THIS AND THEY SEEMED TO BE GOOD. WELL AFTER USEING THIS PRODUCT AS DIRECTED I HAVE SORES WHEREVER I USED IT. IT IS IRRITATED. AND LARGES DRY SORES. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO PUT ON THEM. AND I  CANT GET A DERMATOLOGIST APPT FOR A MONTH. THIS HAS TURN INTO A DISASTER.  I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND</li>
    <li> Legs, chin, neck, toes, and bikini area... All good.  I can&#x27;t quite get the gumpshun to wrangle my underarms, I might need an assistant! I like that it is small and easy to use.  It&#x27;s not quiet, but it&#x27;s not overbearing either. I used it several times over the course of a weekend, to avoid too much pain.  It feels like small electric jolts when you first start until you get used to it.  I would recommend it, if you&#x27;re brave enough to try it, because it does work.</li>
    <li> I have always used battery powered shavers and thought this was the only way to go. This little machine is the final answer for me. Can&#x27;t believe the differences on my face. The 1st week was a little uncomfortable but after is a breeze.</li>
    <li> Not even a little like that.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work, I tried all ways to do it and nothing works.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was the batteries that I removed from another device, but then I put new batteries, still did not work.&lt;br /&gt;I tried several times I just broke and threw it in the trash and my $ 20.51 including shipping I paid was spent for nothing.[[ASIN:B0000DK5LW Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover]]</li>
    <li> I, like a lot of other women, have suffered embarrassment from facial hair for years, but the problem was getting worse in the last few.  Waxing would work well on my fine upper lip hair, but do nothing or the coarse one on my chin.  I hated waxing though, so often I would have a mustache before I would do something about it.  Plucking my chin hair one by one was also a hassle, so it would also get done when I couldn&#x27;t take the embarrassment anymore.  Last winter did some research, I bought the No No Hair removal system.  What a rip off (at least if it worked, for 300$!!!)!  Didn&#x27;t work well within a few months, certainly didn&#x27;t do a good job on the coarse hair, left my skin irritated, and sometimes burned.  Then did my research again...and decided on the Emjoi Epi Slim.  I thought, what have I got to lose for less than 10$?  Well, it&#x27;s been over a month, and my face hasn&#x27;t been so hairless in many years!  It&#x27;s a little bit painful on the upper lip, but so worth it!  after using it, you can feel a little bit of a stubble on the chin, but nothing that someone else would see.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, it is what is working best for me, with best results and minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all other reviewers that took the time to comment on this product, and convinced me to give it a try!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this little trimmer.  Keeps her smooth in all the right places.  Works/perfoms great.  Don&#x27;t understand the neg comments.  Thank you Emjo!</li>
    <li> If you like torture then the product is for you, was not pleased with effect</li>
    <li> I brought this because I recently found out about epilators and wanted to try one out, but didn&#x27;t feel like spending more than $20 for an experimental one. According to other reviews that I had read, I thought that the pain was basically as painful as waxing, and I&#x27;ve been waxed plenty of times before so I didn&#x27;t expect that much pain. I was wrong. It hurt like crazy. I could literally feel every single hair being pulled out and it&#x27;s a constant sharp pain. At least with waxing it covers several areas so it&#x27;s not as noticeable, this one targets extremely specific areas and your attention is easily directed to the areas that are being worked on, so it hurts much more. It did it&#x27;s job, kind of. There were still some hairs left over in random places that I had felt getting picked up but didn&#x27;t completely get pulled off and that was rather annoying. But hey, you get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a good first time epilator, but I think i&#x27;m going to look for something a little better and hurts less..</li>
    <li> Works well, but it does sting a bit, especially in more sensitive areas like the upper lip. Still, it&#x27;s a good alternative to plucking with tweezers.</li>
    <li> This little device is really awesome for hair removing at delicate places. It didn&#x27;t really hurt me at all, and this is actually my first hair remover. Hence, for being a starter it work really great for me, and met al it&#x27;s purpose. It&#x27;s really worth the value, and I just love that is it wireless, so you just have to change batteries. I would recommend it to another !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad all of the normal, non-mutant-haired women out there are getting so much from this product! This thing merely yanks at and ultimately breaks off all the chin and neck hairs I&#x27;ve tried this on. After using, my skin is luxuriously red, bumpy, and what? Full of stubble! Yes, those once long, coarse hairs have been snapped off to create a sumptuous buffet for the senses: hard, brittle, stubble. I end up going back to digging out the hairs with tweezers. For ages I have been living with a red, bumpy, but mostly hair-free chin and neck area using tweezers and was hoping for something more thorough. Which would you rather live with, red bumps and in-grown hairs or a rockin&#x27; 5 o&#x27; clock shadow at noon? Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;My sense is that this epilator isn&#x27;t really meant for the face and/or certain types of hair. (ie my extra coarse mutant hair) Some of the hairs on my neck also lay very flat and close to the skin, which seem to get skipped over entirely by the AP-9L, the ones that do get grabbed though break off into stubble it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next move is to try one of the Braun Silk Epils. According to the product info their epilators push flat-lying hairs forward so they can be grasped and pulled more effeciently. After that, I think I&#x27;ll be old enough to just not care anymore.</li>
    <li> If waxing is painful at least it&#x27;s over quickly.  This thing is long, sustained agony.  I can&#x27;t bear to use it long enough to see how well it really works, but it must be doing something.</li>
    <li> It is really useful for me, I like it, and it is cheap. This is a great thing I think.</li>
    <li> Definitely would not recommend.  I got for chin and upper lip hair removal ... It does not work....pulls hair but does not shave it off as says it does.  Definitely would n ot recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 1 yr ago through Amazon and it actually was much a little less expensive then what it is now ($14.77). I use mostly for my face being that it is small and convenient for travel that is the reason why I got it to begin with. With that being said I have never replaced the batteries on it after about 1 yr use (which is about 1 min use every so often for facial areas). I did use it once on my legs as an emergency (I wax my legs instead) and the hair free only lasted a few days before I started seeing hair grow back. This is why I reverted back to waxing on my legs because that lasts from 1-2 weeks hair free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now considering getting a more bigger and powerful epilator to use on my legs to avoid the messiness of waxing. Just having fully convinced myself since I have been waxing for years and love the long lasting effect of smooth legs after waxing and not to mention that the hair that grows back is about 60% what I had years ago and a lot LESS thinner! I am considering a Remington now because the larger epilators use rechargeable batteries instead and have read good reviews on this one \\&quot;Remington EP6025 Womens Recharegeable Epilator with Bonus Facial Epilator Attachment \\&quot; (this one has 2 attachments for small and bigger areas. Also considering the same brand of course: \\&quot;Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover \\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my first epilator and so far I think the brand and model is excellent for what its suppose to do. I will continue to use it due to its efficiency and travel size.</li>
    <li> I admit to being suspicious of this device.  Why else would people start out saying things like, \\&quot;It didn&#x27;t hurt that much\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, IT DID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I put this anywhere near my tender skin, I looked around for a guinea p--I mean, my husband.  I tried it out on his palm first and then the back of his hand.  He didn&#x27;t flinch.  The man is a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had known better, I would have tried it out on my brother, the Marine.  He would have jumped up and down for me.  In fact, I may try it out on him later, just for fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, picture this.  Use a tweezer to pluck out one hair at a time from your forearm.  Then do it again.  Then do it again.  Then do it again.  Then do it again.  Then do it again.  Then do it again.  Then do it again.  Then do it again.  Then do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse and repeat.</li>
    <li> Best hair remover ever!I have 2...one like this one for smaller areas, &amp; a larger one...both work great! Hair stays gone for quite a while compared to every other hair removal system that I&#x27;ve used,&amp; I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything. The pain is no issue for me,I feel that it&#x27;s minimal for the results achieved. I do have a higher tolerance in general, however. Great product, I highly recommend this...</li>
    <li> Great product easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works well but stings.</li>
    <li> I was very apprehensive as well as doubtful, but, took the plunge anyway because I was tired of shaving and waxing. Also, the price was good, so, I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised. I love this little thing!&lt;br /&gt;It WILL &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; you if you don&#x27;t hold the skin taut and at the angle it tells you to use it at. It does take a bit of time, but, all things considered, I am very pleased and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Very handy. Works well. The battery lasts quite a while. Not for larger areas though.</li>
    <li> Well, it came average timing for living in Hawaii.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I found it good for small jobs. Definately be there for hours if u want a brazillian, good for touch ups and little jobs though.</li>
    <li> I use this item to pluck out my unwanted chin hairs.  Although it took me a time or two to learn to use it well, I now really enjoy not having to search in the mirror for those wayward hairs, just use the epilator back and forth both directions for a minute or so and I am hair-free for another couple of weeks... lasts much longer than regular plucking, and almost no pain or effort.</li>
    <li> This product was a complete waste of my time and money. Was supposed to be less painful than plucking or tweezing, but instead just made a horrible buzzing sound and did nothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for about ten years, and it still seems to be the best option out there for unwanted hair removal. I&#x27;ve been using a regular Emjoi epilator on the legs and under arms, but I hated that anticipation of the pain that accompanies usage of any epilator, and besides I wanted to clean up my bikini line too. I decided to try a ladies shaver. That wasn&#x27;t a good idea at all. My legs and under arms were spiny to the touch the next day already, but otherwise fine, but the bikini line area was itching for over a week! So, I am back to epilating.  I purchased this one looking specifically for something that works for the bikini line - I wouldn&#x27;t allow my regular epilator anywhere close. It does the job nicely. It does not always pick up the hair the first time you try, but eventually it epilates cleanly and is much less painful than the regular epilator. I also use it for under arms - I find it does the job there too. I like it being cordless and the battery seems to last.</li>
    <li> I love this unit, I also have a corded Emjoi Gently Golden which works pretty well and a Braun Silk Epi..  When the charger gave out on the Gently Golden I didn&#x27;t rush out and buy another expensive epilator.. NO... I went to Radio shack and replaced the charger/cord with a generic one for a total cost of around $9.00.  The Emjoi GG is still working fine.      The Braun is fine for my legs but the GG is easier on my underarm area.  I use both units on the closest setting.  It did take me a while to get used to the tweezing, because that is how these epilators work... they pull the hair, root and all from your skin.      If your are very hirsute this may be painful for you even after several uses.  I started with the epilators with the coil and got used to that sensation and the Gently Golden is the most comfortable IMO.      The small cordless Emjoi I am reviewing is NOT meant to be used on your eyebrows and I wouldn&#x27;t use any epilator on the face either. Let&#x27;s face it ladies, some hairs you just  have to tweeze, like it or not...    I have used it on my underarm area and it works comfortably and well due to it&#x27;s smaller size and probably slighter strength.  It does the job without the zest of the larger units.  I also like it for travel or for just a quick touch up.  Try as I might I seem to always find a patch that I missed.     I hate shaving and if you don&#x27;t keep it up every day I find that my leg hairs can be sharp and stick me.. :(  This never happens with the epilators.  This however seems to be a very individual product, more so than other beauty appliances.  We all have different tolerances for discomfort and also varying levels of DESIRE for something to work for us.  My friend hated the expensive epilator  when she first got it but after looking again at the price, which was non refundable she decided that if other people were using it then she could too..     Now she uses it and is extremely pleased with the results and the time it saves her.   This little cordless unit would be a good test to see if you like the concept.  Give it a try.  I have given several of these to friends and family and nobody hates it..</li>
    <li> I have a corded epilator but wanted a small cordless one for my face.  It&#x27;s not the best quality but does a decent job.  It&#x27;s nice to have it in your make up drawer to whip out when you notice a little mustach in the morning before heading to work.  Would recommend it for its price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for three years, and it still works really well - I&#x27;ll repurchase when it stops working.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I used to pluck my underarms (which took forever) and have my upper lip waxed. This is saving me both time and money! If you&#x27;re not used to the sensation of plucking this may not be for you. There is a little bit of clean up, but compared to the time and money I used to spend, the clean up is nothing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator for a while now and it has not really worked as I thought it would.  The Phillips Epilator works a lot better than this. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It works great! simple and affordable</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my wife. she has been using it all the time. it does get the hair that is too fine to get with regular tweesers.  she has been putting rechargable batteries in it without any loss of power.  she has less hair on her chin now.</li>
    <li> I find this pretty good for coarser hair around the face, however, I was not signifiganrly impressed with the performance.  I think for finer hair waxing is better.  It really did not \\&quot;catch\\&quot; onto hair like I thought it would.  However, I do like this better than tweezing.</li>
    <li> This epilator performs as advertised. Its best uses are for touch ups and small areas of hair growth (chin, lip, etc.).  For larger areas, I would recommend a full size epilator. Although the manufacturer recommends alkaline batteries, I&#x27;ve had no problems using my Duracell rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> This is a superb product which i would recommend to everyone. Strong, good size for travel. Well made. Worth the money. Easy to clean!!! Excellent!!!</li>
    <li> The devil made this thing.  I have a tattoo, I&#x27;ve been injured in a car accident, and I&#x27;ve given birth without any drugs.  This is worse.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new way to rid unwanted hair.  This machine is painful!  Feels like getting a tattoo.  I&#x27;m just going to stick with using it on my legs and nowhere else.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a better way to target more hair widths with each pass.  But it gets the job accomplished quite efficiently.  You may need to adjust the orientation of the Epi Slim as you go along.  And the brush does seem to be a decent way of cleaning up after using this product.  My other wishes for this product include the option of using it with a power cord (because I enjoy the versatility and convenience of blended generation technologies), and perhaps a smoother surface for the housing, so it doesn&#x27;t get caught so easily on dry or rough patches of skin.  I am very happy with this purchase, I mean, it does contour to my curves very efficiently.  My suggestions are more upgrade ideas.  I have been using it almost every day for 2 months now.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Painful but good solution for unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> Basically this item came in the mail and I was very excited, mostly because I have a bigger better one at home but right now I&#x27;m visiting my girlfriend etc, anyway. It doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair, you have to press it against your skin and it takes longer than usual to get the job done, but you can do it. Wouldn&#x27;t expect much because it&#x27;s just a travel option, so I guess it gives you want you want for a fair price.</li>
    <li> Used the epilator on my upper lip and it worked swimmingly! It did take me a few tries to get it right though. Just know that if you don&#x27;t feel a sting/pain, it&#x27;s not working correctly. Highly recommend for upper lip! Will try underarms next! :)</li>
    <li> So..I was so tired of waxing my facial hair and was looking for alternatives. I have never done nor will do laser on my face. I am not a monkey face yet a little hair on the sides and above the upper lip is a common appearance. After I started epilating my legs a few weeks ago and seeing the amazing results I decided to start using a face epilator instead of hot wax (wax also has pulling effect on delicate parts of skin and causes premature aging). SO this epilator came high recommended on Amazon and from a few friends of mine who bought it. I used it yesterday for the first time :) First of all make sure your face is clean - do not use this with makeup on. It&#x27;s also good if you wash your face with warm water or do a warm compress beforehand so your pores can open and make it a bit less painful. The sides of my face did not hurt, you just feel small pinches here and there. Upper lip - around the corners of the mouth its again not a biggie but once you get right below your nose or right on the cupid&#x27;s bow, then your eyes will tear and you might scream a few ouches. I gotta be honest - it HURTS in those parts. Afterwards I just wiped my face with cotton pad soaked in witch hazel which contained alcohol (to prevent inflammation)and voila. You don&#x27;t get as red as after waxing, maybe a few small areas but the redness goes away quickly. Results last the same as waxing yet I actually prefer to use this now instead of pulling the skin every time I see a heir popping out. The unit runs on battery and is very lightweight. I am happy with the purchase and excited to use it</li>
    <li> In our household we have 3 Emjoi epilators (all from Amazon) and we like them all for different things.  So I will post this same review for all three.  We started with the AP-9T Tweezers - about $13.95. It is a small battery-operated unit.  At first we had to learn how to use an epilator - how to hold it, etc., but once we got all that down, we found it worked really well for the small areas like upper and lower lip. Unless there is a massive amount of hair, it is not painful but you can feel when it \\&quot;makes hits\\&quot; - like a tweezer pull.  It is not particularly useful for underarms and it would take too long to do the legs.  But since we had got quite addicted to being hairless (and didn&#x27;t have to run out to be threaded every 3 weeks), we decided to buy another so that my daughter and I would each have one.  This time we went up a notch to the Emjoi AP-9L Epi-Slim.  It is about $14.77 at Amazon and also battery operated.  We like it much better.  It too is great for the small areas like the upper and lower lip and chin.      But we decided to also try a more expensive one.  This time we bought the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Tweezer set.  It is about $74.71 and it is more like the size of a men&#x27;s shaver.  It is corded and more powerful.  This one does great under the arms and on the legs and even in the bikini area.  It is not so good on the small areas like the upper and lower lip because the dual heads don&#x27;t fit that well.  But it will do the rest of the face and quite powerfully.  The first time we tried to do the cheeks and the side of the face, it hurt - like little electric shocks as it pulled all that baby fine fuzz most of us have there.  It makes your face so smooth.  But once you get past the first few times and the bulk of the hair has been pulled, it is not painful.      Ladies, there is no reason to be hairy!  These gadgets really work.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used it on my problem area and it worked perfectly.. I would by this for all the woman i know. it does hurt slightly but you get used to it... Very Very Happy</li>
    <li> Works well on a week&#x27;s growth of hair..great price ...Only complaint is that it is quite noisy...  Recommend using talc before using it on underarms to minimize pain    Link : [...]</li>
    <li> After researching various epilators (including serious thought given to braun epil-silk at roughly 5 times the price), I decided on this little beauty.  I was concerned it was going to really hurt, but it&#x27;s nothing we tough girls can&#x27;t handle.  Small, quiet enough, it gets the job done on hair above the lip.  I had no problem with red spots appearing (this is after all, an electric tweezer essentially), as other reviewers of epilators commented.  After tackling my upper lip, I ventured onto my legs, underarms, &amp; bikini line.  Because the unit is so small &amp; slim, it probably isn&#x27;t the best product for the legs.  It took at least 15 minutes, and I&#x27;m sure larger products will get it done more quickly.  But for the other areas it worked really well.  For under $20 it&#x27;s a great starter machine for those of us just beginning our epilator journeys!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 epilators. This one for small areas, and a larger panasonic one for larger areas. I use the smaller one for everything. It works great, and even though the surface area this covers is small it does the job the first time. with the larger one I had to use run it over my skin several times which made my skin very irritated. This little one is awesome. My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t rechargeable.</li>
    <li> This replaced another one that just died after three years.  It was not the battery but it works well and is reasonably priced.  The first time you use it it hurts a lot.  The skin i red an irritated.  You then use it every 5 to 7 days and it is nothing after the first major time.  I just wish that it would last longer than three years.</li>
    <li> I bough the Emjoi A-18 before I purchased this. I have coarse hair and it pulled it out with no problem. Only if you are in a jam and desperately need something, anything to pluck your hair out then I would suggest using the AP-9L. You have to go over the same area so many times with the AP-9L that it leaves what looks like razor burns. Buy the Emjoi A-18.</li>
    <li> Use this for my upper lip (was going to get waxed every other week). Although small, it works awesome and I have noticed less growth after only about a month. It hurts to pull out the hairs this way but that&#x27;s just the process- not the product:)</li>
    <li> After dealing with many unwanted chin hairs for years, this was heaven sent! I&#x27;ve been through electrolysis several times, tweezed for years and was considering laser hair removal. But I was so thrilled with this little epilator I will never have to turn to any of those again! It didn&#x27;t hurt any worse than tweezing, but got ALL of the hairs in just a 2 minutes! I keep feeling and staring at my chin now (lame I know) but I haven&#x27;t had a hair free chin in years! Don&#x27;t think twice about getting this if you have unwanted hairs...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Besides the loud sound and not so good work, I&#x27;m surprised how no one is complaining about the pain. IT HURTS LIKE HELL!!! And I&#x27;m the one, who can deal with the pain on the scale from 1 to 10 about at least 8. I tried on my bikini area and, on the top of the horrific pain, this thing pulls hair so hard that a blood is coming out of my skin along with the roots and tears from my eyes. Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but I never had such a problem while waxing. So, after about 30 seconds of torturing myself with this hair remover, I grabbed my razor and finished the job with shaving the entire area, which seemed like walking on the clouds after using this machine. Yes, I&#x27;m back to shaving or waxing.</li>
    <li> I will tell you that when you first use this product it will hurt if you are not use to it -- it is like the first time you plucked your eyebrows, it hurt, then after about 5 times it was OK --- The first 5 times it will hurt ( on your face ) and leave it red. After that it is a breeze and so fast. No longer missing ones and then seeing them later in a mirror. I also use under my arms and it is great -- again the first 5 times hurt -- my hair under my arms is so thin now and I don&#x27;t have to use as often. I have bought this product for friends and they love as well -- they even use on their arms --- By the way, I have tried others and they did not even come close to this one --- Just remember, if you get through the first 5 or so times of pain and redness, it is a breeze after that -- no more pain or redness</li>
    <li> This product does not work.  Not even worth the refund.  Don&#x27;t be disappointed, I was.  No batteries worked in item, never turned on.  Waste of money and expectations.</li>
    <li> -Before getting this product I had NEVER epilated before, but I had waxed my bikini area.  Needless to say I was really scared to try it.  I also have very light and fine hair.  My arm hairs are completely blonde and it still removed them and it was virtually painless. For the bikini area, it&#x27;s really not that coarse...so if you do have very coarse hair this may not apply to you.&lt;br /&gt;-I bought this at Sally Beauty...I should have bought it from Amazon because its considerably cheaper, however I was able to buy it at a store.&lt;br /&gt;-I have to say I like it a lot more than waxing.  I can only do little patches at a time and you do have to go over and over.  However, I feel it may be less painful because it does not pull at the skin as waxing does.  As is with waxing, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the root.&lt;br /&gt;-I have a couple of spots---literally small little dots that have bled.  It did get read and maybe even swell, however, it is going away really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-I think for the price, and especially the ease of use for a first timer, I would recommend this! Cheaper than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you become more experienced, I do not think that this would be really ideal, as it can only remove a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the most painful parts, I can only describe the sensation as the feel when you&#x27;ve just had your eye brows hot waxed and the stylist plucks left over hairs---except perhaps a bit sharper.  My skin does feel a little raw so I would recommend doing this at night.</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair, and thanks to Dad&#x27;s genes it grows along my jaw line, and is really noticeable after a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving leaves my skin irritated. This product pulls out the hair at the root. It takes a little getting used to, because it stings like heck, but it&#x27;s worth it. My skin feels baby smooth. Make sure to buy a pair of AA batteries, they are not included. It comes with a mini-brush for easy cleaning. The unit itself is easy to handle... it is about as tall as a cell phone, and wide as a hair brush handle.</li>
    <li> This thing is scary, loud and in my opinion painful.  It has spinning tweasers that spin around catching the hair and yanking it out...not my favorite hair removal method and it just looks and sounds dangerous</li>
    <li> This product is ok, not the best.  Your hair do have to grow up to a certain length in order for the device to grab it.  I still love my Emjoi AP18 better because it grabs even the finest hair.</li>
    <li> No more need to spend tons of money at a salon for a brazilian: this little thing does the job perfectly. It&#x27;s also good for touch-ups on the legs and underarms while travelling, but it won&#x27;t do a full job. For that, I have yet to find a good product, as I purchased the [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]]but the hairs break instead of being pulled out, and the [[ASIN:B00742JW8S Philips HP6401 Satinelle Epilator, White/Gray]] which is better, but not ideal either.&lt;br /&gt;This little marvel, on the other had, pulls out hairs in the bikini area very well, and touch ups are only necessary every other week; even every 4 weeks is not that bad. And you can see the root of the hairs pulled.&lt;br /&gt;My advice if you&#x27;re new to brazilians: get it professionally done a few times, and then start using the epilator as a continuous (bi-weekly or so) maintenance. Using the epilator for a first-time job is too painful, and it works best on short regrowth. Make sure to put some vitamin E oil to sooth afterwards.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. Great price. Could not find in stores.</li>
    <li> use this item every 2 weeks, pretty good!</li>
    <li> This was crap. Anyone who has the time to stand there and wait for this to TWEEZE all your hairs is a better person than I. I wish I had never bought it!!!</li>
    <li> The product is very good hair remover. The hair remover is very painful . I think time to use another product  witch out the painful.</li>
    <li> This takes some getting use to coming from using a razor under my arms.  I do like that I don&#x27;t have to shave all the time now.  It did hurt really bad in the beginning but now I am used to it.  Unlike shaving when I am in a hurry, you can not do that with this because you will end up pulling your skin and injuring yourself, which I learned the hard way.  I still use it and love it except for those days when I am in a hurry, I use it all the time.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I Looove this! So easy to use and handle.  Also the cleaing is so easy. Get some good new battery or some rechargeable ones but its up to you. Ok I have to be honest. At first I said I will use this one on my face but then I started using it between my butt cheek like the crack ololo because I could never get in there but now I can love this thing. Sorry for to much the info ololol</li>
    <li> my mom love this product</li>
    <li> at first it wasn&#x27;t working because I had old batteries but once i purchased new ones it worked like a charm. I recommend this product to everyonee. I did my upper lip within a minute and my armpits in half an hour or so, but totally worth it. It definitely hurts less than waxing</li>
    <li> I love this product! I get alot of chin hairs and this works great for removing them. You might have to go over them a couple of times but it is a great product and alot quicker then plucking. It takes about 5 minutes and your done. It used to take me about 20 minutes to a half hour to pluck and get them all. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought two which worked out since the first one died within a few uses. The second one has worked for years. It does the job. A little scary at first but not after your get used to it.</li>
    <li> Product does not perform as described. Am returning it.  Quality poor.  Performance poor.  What a waste.  Dont bother.  Razors are 100% better.</li>
    <li> This item is worthless or worse than that! I surely thought it would remove hair, but it won&#x27;t..About all it does is make some noise.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sorry item for Amazon to be selling.</li>
    <li> I hate these blister packs.  So unnecessary.  The epi slim hair remover is a good little tool, but I feel I have to say something about the overall package.  Let&#x27;s try something more eco friendly.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  It works exactly as described. Since it is very small it is good for touch ups. I definitely will be purchasing a larger one for other areas.  It didn&#x27;t hurt, very smiliar to waxing.  This has saved me time and money. I would recommend anyone wanting to remove hair but hate shaving.</li>
    <li> Wife uses it at least once a week. I tried it and it hurts a lot but gets the job done in small areas.</li>
    <li> Compact, cheap, effective.  What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;I discovered epilating a few weeks ago; in fact I didn&#x27;t even know that epilating existed!  I decided I wanted to give it a try and I purchased this epilator.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and since it runs on batteries I can take it anywhere.  I mainly use it on my arm pits and so far I am very pleased with the results.  Yes it will hurt at first(the pain is bearable and this is coming from someone with a low threshold for pain), especially if you&#x27;re not used to waxing or tweezing, but it&#x27;s worth it.  The hair grows back slower than it does when you shave and the feeling of smooth armpits lasts longer.  After a few uses it won&#x27;t be as painful as the first time (after the third time it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable anymore) :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove some unwanted facial hair and it works like a charm! I don&#x27;t love to wax because no matter what I do it seems like the wax leaves behind a reside. With this it&#x27;s quick, relatively pain free (depends on the area you use it on) and you have results that can last up to 6 weeks. I was shocked at how well it worked. I tried in on my husbands back and it works their too. It&#x27;s a little small for such a large area but it worked. Buy this if you want to remove side burn hair, chin hair, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the one for my legs and love it.  So I was looking at a no-no and then read the reviews and was not impressed.  But the reviews on this one was really good.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and it&#x27;s pretty easy to handle the hardest part and the most uncomfortable when using it there.  I can&#x27;t wax because I break out for weeks after, so this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried a product like this.  I was a little worried about how bad it would hurt.  I used it on my face and this was the first time.  Except for the occasional sting like when you pluck your eyebrows.  I found the pain very minimal and tolerable.  It work great.  Been almost 3 weeks and I am just starting to notice a couple hairs that I will need to be removed.  Alot less hairs have returned.  Love the product and plan on doing it on other parts now.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. I don&#x27;t find it too painful to use after the first time.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use this a first time, I felt it was going to tear my skin off! Maybe if I kept trying a few more times the pain would go away, but my threshold is not high enough, so I never even tried any more times.</li>
    <li> Greatly liked by a friend which I got it for.  They needed a dependable alarm, and say that it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Emjoi Epi Slim for about 12 years now.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it on my face &amp; underarms(only a couple of times)&lt;br /&gt;It still works VERY WELL, but I don&#x27;t want to do without one so I&#x27;m buying a backup.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good here at $23.99 and I almost purchased it&lt;br /&gt;Hubby said I should try another place, so I did (&amp; just purchased a new one) the price was a tad lower (12 years ago lower price - $19.99)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted people to know what a good product this is so they will keep buying them.&lt;br /&gt;I want them to keep making them in case I need one 20 years from now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had full size epiladys &amp; they just shell out so fast!</li>
    <li> Great product. This one is for a Christmas gift, but I have had one for quite a while. Really works.</li>
    <li> I could never get my upper lip complete smooth, until now.  Does the job on my fine facial hair at a very resonable price, but it can be very painful on the tender areas right around the mouth. If your used to tweezing, you should be able to tolerate this since it&#x27;s very quick.  Slim size makes it perfect for the face, but I wouldn&#x27;t try this on my underarms or bikini area.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic.  Does a great job on my face!  It also is very fast - takes no time to do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fair price.  We should have bought a couple more at this price for backups and/or other family members.</li>
    <li> this works ok  not as goods as I hoped it would I&#x27;m on cam all day for work it leave red spots and I have to use every day but works on my legs than the cream</li>
    <li> Causes bumps all my side burns and chin. Didn&#x27;t clear up for at least two weeks. I&#x27;m afraid to use it again. Not sure if its my sensitive skin or what, but i had a bad reaction to using this.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed! While it does a good job with peach fuzz, it doesn&#x27;t want to remove the hairs that are plain enough and long enough to be tweezed with my simple little old-fashioned tweezer, so I end up doing that.  I would not have purchased this product if I&#x27;d thought that I&#x27;d still have to tweeze.</li>
    <li> This item is no way shape, form or fashion comfortable to use on face, bikini line no where on the body, when it says tweezer, they mean tweezer but, very different from doing it the traditional way it actually left the area I shaved sore and hair was still lingering like nothing was done. I get a better shave using my intuition and I know all the hair will be gone with no pain or soreness!</li>
    <li> works well and is painful but could not be more satisfied other than having breakouts . kind of scary to put near your face or private areas but if you follow directions and moisturize afterwards it helps a lot</li>
    <li> This is great for removing facial hair.  It gets all those fuzzy hairs.  I did have some irritation but have found if I cleanse well before and after using epilator its not as bad.  It does sting but no more so than other hair removal methods(ex. Waxing).</li>
    <li> OUCHHHHHHH! Yes it definately rips the hair off your flesh. For some reason I thought it was a laser device, imagine my surprise when I used it. Thank God I started it on a tough part of my body. I have to say it certainly works but I think I will sneak it over to my brothers house and tell him it&#x27;s a new shaver for men. hee hee hee</li>
    <li> I had seen good reviews on the product and wanted to try it. Worked the best of anything I had tried for hair removal.</li>
    <li> OMG, this is very painful.</li>
    <li> Received this item yesterday and I just tried it.  I bought it specifically for my underarm hair.  It&#x27;s very thick and I was looking for an alternative to shaving as the black stubble is always still visible.  I used it right after I showered thinking it would make the hair come out easier.  That may be true but I&#x27;m telling you it hurts like crazy.  The thing is loud and fast and reminded me of some sort of torture device.  Although it hurt at first many reviews said that you get used to it.  So I kept going.  I didn&#x27;t get used to it.  You have to go over the same spots over and over and it takes a long time.  I eventually had to give up.  After the redness goes down and the bleeding stops I&#x27;ll shave what I missed.  I gave 2 stars because I do have some very nice clean patches...I may try it again with the hopes it get&#x27;s easier but I doubt it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this years ago! Women don&#x27;t like to admit they can grow hair in the beard area. My hair was too fine to be picked up by wax.  Nair type products irritated my skin and had a terrible odor.  This little gadget is so wonderful. I get less and less hair growing back.  May pinch a tad at first but you get used to it quickly.</li>
    <li> My face has a lot of black hair, and due to my problem I purchased this product. It really solved my problem forever! So easy to use! removes the hair from the root so that you experience a smooth skin! I definitely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really too happy with this product. It gets the job done, I guess, but it&#x27;s sooo painful. It takes a long time to get one hair out. You have to make sure you pull your skin very tight with this one because it will pinch it! I was hoping this would be easy to travel with and use on sensitive areas but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, I would rather just use a bigger one. I didn&#x27;t even take it with me when I traveled. Just took my bigger one. I would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A great product and priced well. Did just what I wanted, got rid of the hereditary &amp;#34;grandma hairs&amp;#34;, as we ladies refer to them in our family, from the upper lip and chin. Easy to use, easy to clean</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as expected based on the product reviews but it was affordable in price and good size and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how small this slim version was going to be until I got it. Needless to say I gave it a try as its my first time using something like this aside from actual tweezers, on my arm near my wrist. The pain wasn&#x27;t surprising it was the little scratches it left behind and the fact that I had to go over one spot several times and that didn&#x27;t always work. Instead of taking the hairs out by the root it sometimes just broke it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend you use this are large area&#x27;s, like say your legs unless you have plans to give up 4 to 5 hours to finish the deed. You&#x27;d be smarter to shave and then apply Emjoi&#x27;s hair growth inhibitor.</li>
    <li> I am very sad. I had hoped this would work but it is a waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t get the hair on your chin, only the downy hair on the sides of face. Do not buy, I would have returned it but threw away container.</li>
    <li> I have owned a smaller Emjoi for many years, but it only had one row of tweezers and used two AAA batteries. It took a long time to use and I only used it on fine facial hair. This new takes two AA batteries, so stronger power, has three rows of tweezers, works really fast and does a much better job of removing hair. I use this one on both fine facial hair and coarse underarm hair. It works great for both. If you are worried about the pain, don&#x27;t. I found the first time I removed the stubble under my arms a little uncomfortable, but not much at all and after the first removal, no pain at all. It is so nice not having to shave under my arms every day. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is and OK product, but it is painful to use and you have to go over the same spot several times.</li>
    <li> Did the job pretty good, only thing is u gotta go over the same spot several times. Would have liked if it wasn&#x27;t battery operated.</li>
    <li> Takes AA batteries, good for hair at least 1/4 inch long, occasionally grabs the super fine ones.  Lot faster than using tweezers.</li>
    <li> This is handy and compact to travel with.  However, you really have to be careful, because it gets away from you around your lip area and you need to be very careful.</li>
    <li> excellent product for the price  easy to use and virtually painless  I certainly recommend it for removing stray facial hair</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work but after reading reviews thought I&#x27;d give it a try! It works great :) goodbye to regular tweezers!! It&#x27;s slightly uncomfortable to use at first but you get used to it! Great product!</li>
    <li> Really works but I recommend buying like a numbing cream. It&#x27;s painful but thank God I found something that finally works for me so I will NEVER EVER!! have to use a freaking razor ever again because they leave ugly marks on my skin..</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Met my high expectations</li>
    <li> This is great for removing those unwanted facial hairs... so glad I got it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, eats batteries up and no very efficient, didn&#x27;t remove any hair.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT! HAVE TRIED SHAVING, WAXING, CHEMICALLY REMOVING HAIR. NONE HAVE WORKED AS WELL AS THIS PRODUCT. SHAVING GIVES ME BUMPS AND BURNS. WAXING IS TOO PAINFUL. CHEMICALS ALWAYS BURN ME AND SCAR ME. I HAVE REALLY SENSITIVE ALABASTER SKIN. ONLY CON IS THAT IT HURTS A BIT THE FIRST TIME YOU USE IT (NOT AS BAD AS WAXING THOUGH) AND I WAS A LITTLE SORE THE DAY AFTER. WAS FIRST USE SO I WAS A BIT OF A NEWBIE AND PROBABLY DID IT WRONG.</li>
    <li> Stops working and you must hit it to start again, very annoying to stop, fix and start again. Does not hurt.</li>
    <li> Perfect for touch up after brazilian epilation</li>
    <li> Got this and tried it. Yes it hurt but was expecting that. But after several passes over I still would have a lot of hair left.</li>
    <li> love the product will definitely order some more cuz more and more friends are falling in love with this hair remover</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not able to use due to how painful it is to use. Was really hoping to stop waxing and plucking. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I hope it never wears out!  After pulling out &amp;#34;goat hairs&amp;#34;  for over 30 years with tweezers, this Epi Slim is heaven sent.  It&#x27;s not any more horrible than tweezers, in fact, it&#x27;s way better, and a lot faster and easier.  I keep it in my purse like a treasure.  I give my chin a touch-up while I watch TV.  In fact, my daughter just ordered one for herself after she heard me brag about how wonderful it is.  She should have waited.  I had planned on getting her one for her birthday.  Read the directions.  Pulling the skin tight is the trick.</li>
    <li> I like it! This is my first epilator, and it&#x27;s easy to clean, super-fast, small &amp; not painful at all. It doesn&#x27;t get every hair in one pass (I did have a similar experience as some other reviewers in that it breaks some of the more coarse hairs rather than plucking them), but if you use it daily for a few days until you get everything, then you just have to maintain once every week or two. It&#x27;s been pretty great - HUGE timesaver over tweezing.</li>
    <li> Tried this for a long time does not produce results it is claiming to produce would not buy again ever.</li>
    <li> Good item for those too close for comfort places. Nice on the bikini area, eyebrows and around the ears (for men)</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this product after a little use was that rechargable batterys were a must. But overall I give it 4 stars. It is slim, light, and very manuverable in tight places such as underarms and the back of the knees. The overall design also allows for a light, pencil like grip which almost makes it fun to use. I would deffinatly recomend this product and have already to a couple of my friends.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried in 2 years that actually works.  I wish I&#x27;d found it months ago!  I am joyful.</li>
    <li> ive used this product maybe twice since i bought it.  i dont really like it.  ive read the directions and am following them the best i can but it just isnt working for me.  i find it doesnt get all of the hair from my upper lip and that if you use it for a LITTLE while the metal part that pulls the hair gets very hot and burns.  then again, maybe im not using it right, this is my first epilator.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. I especially like it for facial hair. Even works great on armpit hairs. Very happy with this tool.</li>
    <li> I would expect this kind of quality from a 25 cent machine...the instrument is rattling and grinding when I have, timidly, put it to my skin...upon which it bites and pulls, leaving blistered skin and ripped hair. I&#x27;m no dummy, I exfoliated, thoroughly dried the skin and kept it taut each time I attempted to tame this beast and make it useful...to no avail :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr - CHEAP PRODUCT, WASTE OF MONEY, DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> It really works wonders for me. Been using this for a while I barely notice hairs as much if do there thinner the  hair don&#x27;t come back as fast</li>
    <li> it does grab some hairs, but overall, you&#x27;re better off with a pair of tweezers--or try wax--or anything else :)</li>
    <li> I just got it for a relative and I tried it on my arm and it appears to work well.  I liked it so I hope it will continue to function well.</li>
    <li> Have been using this thing for 4 years now and it really does the job. I apply alcohol after to avoid irritation and scars.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see that it did work for me. I love it...now I just have to get the after shave for post epi-ing, definitley satisfied though.</li>
    <li> This epilator works and at a good speed.  I have been  using this epilator for over a year and it still looks and works like new!!</li>
    <li> i like this...works........a little pinchy but it does the job............................think it was a decent purchase.......ive used it quite a bit</li>
    <li> Very good product....I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I got my product on time and used it that same day. It did feel a little uncomfortable but not anywhere near to what some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read about it being too painful to use. I used it on my underarms which didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Now my bikini line did sting a little but not so much that I had to stop using it. I love it!! I am going to buy a bigger one for my legs some time soon.</li>
    <li> If you are a fifty something woman whose eyebrows have migrated to your chin, I highly recommend this.  I have a high pressure job - I tried electrolysis and laser treatments, but did not have the time to invest.  Also, you need to trim your chin hairs with scissors ---- Not a solution if you have to face people every day.  I was known at work as \\&quot;The Tweezers Girl\\&quot;; I plucked every morning in my car, had tweezers in my purse and desk drawer.  Happily my best friend told me she never saw hairs on my chin, but it took a lot of effort. -  This has been the perfect solution.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews saying it hurt less than the old epilators from years ago.  They also said it hurt less than threading.  I knew I could stand the pain on my chin, but wasn&#x27;t sure about my my upper lip and under my lip.  I figured it was worth a try.  I had baby orajel to numb my face just in case.  I didn&#x27;t need it.  Be sure to hold your skin tight, it gets the hair better that way and is less painful.  It is not painless, but is bareable.  Hurt less than threading.:)</li>
    <li> I have used a larger epilator on my legs for years but it was too big for the sensitive \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; hairs.  Yep, when you get past a certain age you start growing a mustache and beard (and I don&#x27;t mean if you&#x27;re a man), sigh.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this occasionally on my face around my mouth and chin (when I&#x27;m not pulling out separate hairs with my tweezers).  It pulls and hurts a little more than the one I use on my legs; I guess because my face is more sensitive.  I find that if I pull the skin tight on the area I&#x27;m using it on it hurts less, and I don&#x27;t mean hurts like I&#x27;m gonna start crying.  You just know that it&#x27;s pulling your hair out by the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is something I unfortunately need in my arsenal and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Unsure if it&#x27;s just me but the battery usage is little to none. Didn&#x27;t even turn on (tried multiple batteries).</li>
    <li> I received this item yesterday and immediately used it.  It took no time at all to remove facial hair.  I was very leery after reading some of the bad reviews but I am totally delighted with this product.  I no longer will be tweezing single hairs now that I have this product.  Great price and very compact.</li>
    <li> Efficient and easy to use at a really great price.  Used it on my upper lip to take care of strays after doing laser removal.  The hair has not yet started to grow back after a few weeks.  Have used it on legs and bikini line and experienced only slight pain.  The hair has grown back somewhat, but not much and very slowly.  It&#x27;s easy to use, lasts a long time, and is a very inexpensive method for hair removal.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for another that died - my good luck - it&#x27;s better than the other brand I had been using.</li>
    <li> you  need to go over the area several times to get rid of the hair, but it does an ok job. I would have given it a 3.5 stars, but it got a 4. It is a reasonable cost for the job as opposed to some other hair removers that go for a couple of hundred dollars, so it is worth going over areas a few times. Would probably but it again.</li>
    <li> I have to pass over the hairy area write a few times and it hurts like heck!! However, it works for what it is.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of this product.  I keep it in my makeup case and use it probably once a week.  Great little hair removal system.  No side effects..  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have never had anything that came as close to torture as this device! It burnt my skin and hurt worse than anything I have ever seen!</li>
    <li> This is a handy hair remover, easy to use. Comfortable to hold. Good for travel. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Was looking at much more expensive items before finding this.  Had used hot wax (and burned skin), hot sugar products (and burned skin), sticky tapes that irritated skin terribly, and was very frustrated with facial hair growth.  The long slow process of individual tweezing was miserable.  This hair growth in menopause was the bane of my existance, but getting the Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Hair Remover has been an answer to prayer!  It does hit skin now and then and feel slight discomfort but overall, it&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s efficient, it pulls hair out by roots so no rough stubble grow back like from shaving or rubbing off hair removal means.  It&#x27;s wonderful! Am loving it and will buy a second just to make sure if anything happens to the one, that I have a backup and I hope they never discontinue such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is just what i wanted! Have used it and the results are great! No more tweezing! No more using harsh creams! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and black hair, so I&#x27;ve battled face fur all my life. After buying an expensive epilator which only plucked some hairs after I went over and over the same spot, I read reviews again. I was resigned to spending big bucks for an epilator until I read rave reviews on the Emjoi Epi Slim Hair Remover. When it arrived in the mail yesterday, I ran straight to my lighted makeup mirror and tried it. Wow! I held my skin tautly, ran the small head over keys spots , and those hairs were gone, whether fine or coarse. The small epilator  head gets into close spots and removes those hairs on the first swipe. What a great product for the money!!</li>
    <li> A wonderful product that makes it easy to take an epilator with you on holidays or when travelling on business. Despite the small head, it removes hair very quickly and effectively. Batteries tend to last a long time as well.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I&#x27;m guessing she liked it since I haven&#x27;t heard her say anything negative about it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Almost painless even on sensitive areas, long as you keep skin stretched. It is better for small areas</li>
    <li> As I get older I&#x27;ve discovered the curse that I lot of women have. Chin hair. It&#x27;s unsightly and unattractive. Well ladys this gets your chin nice and smooth with no stubble.</li>
    <li> My lawnmower died so I thought...what the heck? No...not really! (and not for ME, it was for Her)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well - no blood, swearing, and I even had a coffee after!</li>
    <li> I wished I had known about this product sooner!  I use this faithfully on areas of my face where light hair gows and it takes it off so fast and it stays off for weeks!  I used to use tweezers and considered going for Laser to take care of this problem I was having...and I saw this Emjoi AP-9 Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover and it&#x27;s absolutely something for others to consider buying!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to my friends that need facial hair removal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda&lt;br /&gt;RI</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will. It is a little painful but is worth the pain. I would recommend to anyone that has been searching for a product that will remove all of the unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my 25 yr old daughter. She is dark haired, &amp; has unwanted&lt;br /&gt;hair on her chin &amp; neck. The results far exceed what we expected. I have used it&lt;br /&gt;a couple of times. I am 51 &amp; Thank you menopause, I now get whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review, because I came back to order one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
    <li> This product is scary to use it makes a loud sound when you use it and its painful to use.</li>
    <li> It is just okay - can&#x27;t really explain what I was expecting but the product really is just ok - I wouldn&#x27;t highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use it for my underarm area, and it works GREAT! So quick and easy, and so smooth. Never shaving or tweezing there again. It doesn&#x27;t work as well for legs or bikini line, but for $20 you can only hope for so much. Good product, I love it!</li>
    <li> I used it on my facial hair and It did not work. It didn&#x27;t pick up even the thin hairs on my upper lip and forget the coarse hairs.</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped it would.  But maybe it works well for other people who have bought it.</li>
    <li> I have used Emjoi-AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair remover and it was ok, not what I expected. I will recommend it to others. I cannot use it on my face but, on my under arm and legs. I orded for facial hairs and it would hurt my face but was great for other parts of my body.</li>
    <li> My EMJOI is the perfect solution to removing facial hair and cheek fuzz. Very effective. Worth the minor discomfort.  I have recommended this to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Okay ladies...this thing is awesome! Been plucking upper lip hair one by one with tweezers for many years.  Decided to try this little thing and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  When you first pull it out of the box it looks really scary and you wonder if it is going to scar you for life. Basically it is many tweezers on a wheel that spins and pulls hair.  The first time you use it it stings a little (like you are plucking a few hairs at a time).  I use it for less than 1 minute each day and barely even feel the split second of sting any more.  No more trying to find the perfect light for plucking or leaning on the counter to pluck.  I wish I would have discovered this years ago.</li>
    <li> it was missing the little brush when it arrived but it&#x27;s perfect for coarse underarm hairs. I haven&#x27;t used it anywhere else, so I can&#x27;t speak for that</li>
    <li> This remover is really really amazing!! Trust me, you will not regret it, I swear. Recommend it!! It can help you remove your hair very clean and make your skin smooth although might be a little hurt..</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally receive my Emjo AP-9L Epi Slim hair remover, but OMG what a disappointment. I used it on my upper lip exactly how the instructions called for. Not only did it NOT remove the hair, but it ended up irritating my skin so bad that the next day I actually had little cuts which scabbed up over the following days. Not that that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, then in one area I had a cold sore outbreak on my face. It was a cluster of 5 small cold sores which are still in the healing process! There should be a warning that if you are prone to cold sore outbreaks, this may happen! If I would have known that, I would never have pursued this product. If you are a cold sore sufferer, you know where I&#x27;m coming from! Needless to say, I returned this piece of garbage and would NEVER recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve survived all these years without one of these!! Great for us Italian girls with unwanted facial hair! Leaves your skin so smooth and soft. It takes a little getting used to but I just love it and I&#x27;m buying one for my sister too!</li>
    <li> Short story:&lt;br /&gt;- creates oodles of in-grown hairs,&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t pull out enough of the root or possibly pulls none of the root,&lt;br /&gt;- painful, skin irritations,&lt;br /&gt;- not for fine hair,&lt;br /&gt;- not for ultra sensitive zones,&lt;br /&gt;- grow back begins very quickly, 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have owned this for a few months. First epilator I&#x27;ve owned. Had previously used pre-waxed strips and tweezers, which work without much incident. This looked like a cheap way to test epilators, which looked a faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIKINI: It grabs coarse hair fairly well, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to rip out enough of the root. When I wax or tweeze, I always see more of the root on the ripped out hairs. With this, I almost never see any part of the root portion coming out with the hair. I suspect this Emjoi doesn&#x27;t rip powerfully enough and it is only breaking off the hair shaft just below the skin surface. That is probably why the hair grows back so very quickly (less than 1 week - vs 6 weeks for waxing and tweezing) - and that&#x27;s probably why oodles come back in-grown. The in-grown hairs are painful and ugly. Another reason I think it is breaking the hair shaft rather than ripping out the root: the hair that grows back in comes back just as stubbly feeling as if it had been shaved. When I wax or tweeze, the hair grows back in ultra fine and soft. So this thing can&#x27;t be getting the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SENSITIVE: Doing the face, or doing the bikini zone at the panty line or outside the panty line isn&#x27;t more painful than waxing. However, using this thing inside the panty-line on those ultra-sensitive areas is beyond painful - far more painful than waxing or tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE: Tried only once on face and it had a very hard time grasping the very fine, peach fuzz type hair. Afterwards, I had raised lumps in the entire zone where I&#x27;d used the emjoi ap-9L. They went away in a few days, thankfully. Threading works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this numerous times over the few months I&#x27;ve had it - and it keeps doing the same things wrong. I thought maybe it was a fluke and didn&#x27;t want to give it up, but this is just an epic failure and I&#x27;m finally finished with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Cheap? Yes. Good? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine where those positive reviews come from!</li>
    <li> I wish this didn&#x27;t hurt so much because it works really well, I just can&#x27;t get used to the pinching feeling when you use it. But I&#x27;m also a sissy.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the &#x27;NoNo&#x27; product for hair removal.  It doesn&#x27;t work too bad, but could be better.  I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t battery operated bc i go through a lot! Ive been using it for a month or so and it is easy breezy on the arms &amp; legs. it is difficult and painful as hell under arms and private areas due to the way you have to hold the skin and the emjoi so it takes a lot of patients bc it is slow! I dont know if its worth it yet.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this purchase. Fast and great packaging.This one seems to work unlike others.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again and have a good day.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this little thing. Works well taking care of unwanted facial hair (chin). It was painful to use the first few times, now I can&#x27;t even feel the sting from the hairs being plucked. Hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for a while. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I can never get all the hairs no matter how many times I pass the same area, always have to go back in with tweezers. I don&#x27;t think tweezing and waxing are painful, but this is sorta painful. I tried it on my armpits and i got a lot of knicks, probably because it&#x27;s hard to hold the skin really taught in that area. Tried it between the cheeks and got bumps cause it just pinches your skin so much.</li>
    <li> Was everything I expected, thank you :)</li>
    <li> Very happy with my results!&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product, I have used at least once a week since purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Very glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I recieved my Emjoi today and it is just great. Seem&#x27;s to have a lot of power and in no time the unwanted hair was gone.  Yes it bites a little but after years of waxing I am pretty tough.  Any time you pull hair out it will hurt for a second or so.  But the little amount of pain is so well worth it. I am going to buy another one just to always have one on hand.</li>
    <li> I thought it worked very well.  I did have to go back over certain parts of my legs.  It does make your legs/underarms  look cleaner than a razor and it really did not hurt.  I like it!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife! She live it. She removes hair under her chin where it is hard to see. She loves it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price, but went back to waxing.  Doesn&#x27;t quite grab enough hair unless it gets pretty long</li>
    <li> This is the most painful thing. It&#x27;s basically and electric tweezer and it hurts more then it should pulling in more then one hair at a time.... Not worth it. Stick to regular razors or a normal electric for in between shaving. This product is terrible!</li>
    <li> Lava soap and a razor will get you a lot further than this. Be prepared for skin irritation and bumps. Women, if you&#x27;re hairy, do what men do: shave. Men don&#x27;t do it to make themselves hairier.</li>
    <li> Its claim no pain, and i cant use it since i never fell so much pain, even wax is painless compare to this</li>
    <li> it plucks away even the smallest strand of hair--very good--a good product for facial hair removal--I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Thank you. My order came very quickly and I LOVE it! Made my life so much easier. Works great and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works great, but it hurts a little when you are removing hair from the face. I love it because you don&#x27;t have to do it often. The hair grows back slowly.</li>
    <li> Personally I only use it for under arms but it does a great job. I have a Braun Silkepil that I used before but this guy is much better: hurts less, no cable and can come with me when I travel to Europe. Yep, love it!</li>
    <li> This little gadget does a great job on longer hairs, but it does not catch the tiny hairs that I wanted it to get.  You know, those stubborn little chin hairs?  I wanted to be able to get them just as they were surfacing.  I usually use tweezers, but I thought I would give this a try.  I&#x27;m back to tweezers.  If I let the hairs grow out a little, then it works well....but who wants to let their chin hairs grow?  There is minimal pain...probably about what you would expect with tweezers.  I just wish it could have gotten the smaller hairs.</li>
    <li> Yes it does cause some discomfort but considering the results I got it is worth it. It isn&#x27;t unbearable and you get somewhat use to it. Leaves a clean and smooth feel and I am delighted how well it works.</li>
    <li> This remover is not for human skin. It is absolutely useless item. It hurts your skin and does not remove most of hair in major areas (I bought for legs). Do not waste money!</li>
    <li> I am using this in conjunction with the Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator -36 Gold. It works well underarms because of the slim design. The wider epilator will not work well in small boney areas like the knee cap. Very fast, removes hair well and does not hurt.</li>
    <li> It does what it says and it works well so i have no problems. I would recommend this product if you need something quick and easy.</li>
    <li> First I recommend this.  I used it a couple of times and it did hurt.  However, by mistake I creamed my face and then wiped it off - and I had NO PAIN.  It was wonderful. When the hair grows back, it comes in soft - not coarse.</li>
    <li> This works great i bought it to remove my facial hair (chin) and its great for the price its a little small to do your legs but with patience its duable... I love it no more hours every days with twiser :)</li>
    <li> tossed it after first use. It may have removed one or two hairs at the most.</li>
    <li> Works great, but its a bit of a torture machine...</li>
    <li> The best battery operated hair removal tweezers ever! No woman should ever go without one!</li>
    <li> totally dissatisfied, Useless product. It leaves burning sensation on skin and sometimes bruises also. I dont know what they were thinking when making it as to where to use it.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. Just a tip..clean your skin with alcohol before and after use to prevent red bumps. Great product...highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pulling hairs for years and this really saves some time. It just isn&#x27;t attractive for a woman to have whiskers and I&#x27;ve been tweezing for over 20 years. This will pull so many at one time and  I just have a few stragglers.</li>
    <li> This did not remove any hair. It hurt to use this</li>
    <li> Good product, five stars. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it ; pulls and very uncomfortable!</li>
    <li> Hurts too much!&lt;br /&gt;Also caused a rash burn from targeting the tiny fine hairs from under lip area.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to use on upper lip area also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good hair remover to use in small parts and less hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and light, good to take everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;It works with battery and it&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I believe this device can really work, but I have a little problem with it - it&#x27;s speed. It&#x27;s too fast and powerful, and hurts when it pulls a hair. I&#x27;m not using it much because of that. I wanted to give it 3 stars, but then added one, - it does pull hair, it&#x27;s just uncomfortable for me!</li>
    <li> This product makes hair removal much easier. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the hair, but then again the chin is a hard place to get at hair. I don&#x27;t use it any where else on my face, it hurts a lot around the lips....and I am a bit of a baby, but the chin was the thing that really bothered me so at least that problem is mostly solved.</li>
    <li> It arrived alot quicker than I expected which was very pleasing because I was excited to try it! I tested it on my arm because at times Im embarrassed of the amount of hair I grow (definite downside of having thick hair on your head). It worked pretty well so I decided to try it on my bikini area which was my main reason for purchasing. I did the top &amp; sides of my bikini area and it worked very well, I have coarse quick-growing hair there too so I was surprised that stubble didnt appear the very next day, in fact it&#x27;s been 3 days. I went ahead and shaved the rest of my private area because I got too far down to where epilating became too painful. There is now a distinct difference between the two areas! the top only has a trace amount of stubble while the rest has the normal amount of growth im used to seeing after about 2 days. It is painful if you don&#x27;t have a high tolerance, but personally the result was worth it. Until there is an affordable and painless way to remove hair from the root this is the method I&#x27;ll be using.</li>
    <li> I have owned my emjoi for over 2 years now and absolutely love it.  I wont lie it does hurt but about as much as tweezing, which you get used to... Now i can go about a month and a half between treatments, sometimes longer. I use it on my underarms, upper lip, chin, and side burns.  The hair growth is also less and with finer hair.  I definitely recommend this product, you are definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Recommed for face, and other small areas. Not sure about legs because of size  you could if you wanted to</li>
    <li> When I first got this epilator, I was very anxious to try it out. I took it out of its packaging, put in some batteries, turned it on and then freaked out! I was caught all the way off guard by how seemingly loud the thing was in comparison to its size. With great hesitation, I inched the epilator towards my armpit, freaked out again, stopped, and tried again until I eventually allowed the epilator to touch my skin&#x27;s surface for a brief second. I&#x27;m glad I did! I got over the sound and have been using this on my armpits since then, no looking back to my razor ever! For me, this epilator is quick and effective at getting even the finest hairs out from the root with minimal discomfort. Of course, this does pull hair out from the root, so do not expect to feel nothing. I raise my arm up and use the hand on the same arm that I&#x27;m epilating to hold my skin taut before epilating. This helps. The epilator is very quick. I have gone from shaving every other day to epilating 2-3 times a month! Also, shaving left my armpits slightly darker than the rest of my underarm areas but since using this epilator, the skin is the same color as all surrounding areas. I cannot speak on this epilator&#x27;s ability to remove hair from any other area of the body, as I have different means for removing unwanted hair from various areas, but for armpits, this is great!</li>
    <li> As simple as following the directions! Hold the epilator at at 90 degree angle to the skin, don&#x27;t press, and glide the tweezer in a circular motion. Might take a few passes until you get the hang of it and all the area is smooth; after that just touch up when your finger tips tell you it&#x27;s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first  time in forever I no longer feel self-conscious about facial hair, my skin is soft and smooth. No wax irritation, no smelly creams, just pretty skin.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  Hair regrowth is not delayed for weeks as promised which tells me that the stubborn hair is not pulled out from the roots.  This product is not worth the money, I am doing better with just a plain pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> Great for quick hair removal and small enough to take any where. This is easy to use, only complaint is that it is hard to clean. It does what it&#x27;s meant to and gets lots of hair with one pass. Please note that if you are sensitive, it WILL hurt, it feels just like tweezing and gets multiple hairs at once, so it&#x27;s not for you if you are a sissy when it comes to tweezing. :)</li>
    <li> It does the job of getting rid of hair on my neck.  I only have to use it once a week versus shaving with a razor every other day.  I even had lazer hair removal done at a doctors office at a 400.00 price for 3 sessions  (half off for a valentine&#x27;s special ) and that didn&#x27;t work.  This has been the easiest way I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 months ago after seeing all good review against it and am a bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used it on my Upper lip and CHIN area and it hurt a lot. I expected that because I have \\&quot;braun silk epil\\&quot; but what I didn&#x27;t expect was the wound .. it scratched my skin layer and gave painful bumps that created a mark its over four week still the mark is there. It was so gross and embarrassed. I&#x27;m not too sure what I did wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I did notice was that I had to go over the same area multiple times to get the majority of the hair out and never really did get it all. I think that causes the BUMP and CUT .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product because it seemed like it  requires more power to get all of the hair cleanly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.  I MAY HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN ,BUT the PRODUCT says that IT IS FOR SENSITIVE SKIN ...&lt;br /&gt;I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT and UNHAPPY ....</li>
    <li> First of all when I put the batteries in nothing happened. I was ready to box it up and send it back when I started manually spinning it with my hands and then it started working. After about 5 minutes of pulling my face in every direction imaginable I got tired and gave up. Of course, It didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair and worse yet, I will still have to shave. Which I can&#x27;t do for at least 24 hours because I don&#x27;t want to further irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for pain, I didn&#x27;t have any pain with it. I have a large emjoi hair remover that I use occasionally on my face but prefer not to use the same thing on my face and body which is why I got this. This to me was a complete waste of money. Sure It will remove a few hairs but don&#x27;t look for any miracles and keep your razor close because you will need it.</li>
    <li> Like the product handy and really effective</li>
    <li> It seems facial hair has to be a bit long for this to actually work.&lt;br /&gt;So if you bought it for facial areas, maybe look for something else.</li>
    <li> I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL, ABOUT ORDERING THIS PRODUCT!!! BUT LET ME TELL YOU... YES IT WORKS... I ORDERED THIS BECAUSE SHAVING SOMETIMES CAUSES INGROWN HAIRS WHICH MAY CAUSE PAINFUL BUMPS AND DARK BLEMISHES. I WILL WARN YOU THAT AT FIRST IT DOES HURT BECAUSE IT ACTS LIKE  20 TO 30 TWEEZERS WORKING AT THE SAME TIME. BUT PAIN IS BEAUTY.. IF YOU ARE LIKE ME, AND YOU ARE TIRED OF THE UGLY BUMPS AND DARK SPOTS THAT HAIR WILL LEAVE.. TRY THIS.. I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT THE HAIR DOES NOT GROW AS FAST.. THE HAIR UNDER THE ARM IS BARELY GROWING AND IT HAS BEEN 2 WEEKS... YAY.. SEXY ARM PITS,, HERE I COME.... NOW ON THE HUNT FOR THE LARGER EMJOI... HAVE NOT TRIED THE BIKINI LINE.. NOT BRAVE ENOUGH FOR THAT... BUT EVERY WHERE ELSE.. I KNOW IT WORKS AND THE PAIN BECOMES BEARABLE....</li>
    <li> Have only used it once, and so far so good.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt but does jump around.  It does save tremendous time,&lt;br /&gt;and gives me confidence that the hairs are removed.</li>
    <li> A none working unit was delivered. Amazon made it an easy return, did not even have to make out a label ~ cost free return shipping ~ UPS pickup at the door ~ immediate refund on return. For replacement, I decided to order the Emjoi Divine, having 36 tweezer discs, 2 speeds, and costing just a couple dollars more.</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely nothing.  I would definitely order a larger unit.  The get a real attitude should you want to return the product.</li>
    <li> this little shaver is just great. easy to handle,  light weight, holds a great charge and really does the job.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this specific hair remover since she was so happy with hers. And, I too, am very pleased. There is no irritation after use. VERY quick shipping! Just a quick add-on: be certain to read the instructions before using. It can be very painful otherwise, but once you understand what to expect it works very smoothly and easily removes hair.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all. It just isn&#x27;t powerful enough. I thought I would try it because it was so cheap but it is definitely worth spending $60 and getting an epilator that is actually strong enough to remove hair.</li>
    <li> i used this product over a week ago and i haven&#x27;t had any hair grow back yet.  just put onto skin very slightly and it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the pits and it works great. After the second use it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and I notice less and less regrowth. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter .  She uses it all the time</li>
    <li> I still have mine after two years, and my little brush to clean out the hairs is so useful, you should really buy this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small &amp; manageable. I don&#x27;t think you need a more powered one like most buyers prefer. This is just perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for some time now and I don&#x27;t use it often, maybe once a month. I thought it would be a good investment to last me a few years but recently I tried turning it on and it wont start, I even changed to a fresh pair of batteries and it still wont turn on..</li>
    <li> I was tired of using hair removal products that would leave my face red sensitive for days. This item is good for fine hair. Not too good with the course hairs.  I still had to pull out my teasers to get those bad boys.  The good thing is I was able to use my make up immediately after I used this little fella.  I used it on my sister.  She&#x27;s very hairy and it did a great job of removing her facial hair too.  I can use this a little more frequently whereas, with the facial creams that would remove my hair, I could only use them once a month. The price was good.  It does need batteries but it has a lot of power.  The pain level wasn&#x27;t bad.  It felt like a slight stinging sensation.  I used it on my face, upper lip and under arms.</li>
    <li> Looks just like it was presented on-line but does not work well at all. I think the hair removal area is too small</li>
    <li> It literally burned my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather pay for an all other body wax then EVER use this product again!!!</li>
    <li> it simply does not work, very disappointing product, this is the second time I have tried it and it just does not do what it is supposed to</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid it didn&#x27;t work for me.  No matter how many passes I made on my chin, it did not do the job.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good product -- does what it claims to.</li>
    <li> If you are Asian with thin hair, this is not the right one for you. It won&#x27;t pull out the hair but break it</li>
    <li> This does not really work well on leg hair because it&#x27;s a tweeze action and is slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is amazing for these hard-to-reach hairs you can&#x27;t find and tweeze otherwise, with less strain-- just use it as though it was an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Great little machine!  It plucks and saves a lot of time over going hair by hair!  I also use it on my legs as well as my face.  Yes, I know........!  Works great!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well for little areas.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with an epilator.  I am someone who had to use tweezers frequently for upper lip hair and random chin hairs.  This worked perfectly and my skin is very smooth.  It does hurt at first, but I quickly adapted and was able to finish with no problems.  I ordered a larger one for my legs.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who battles unwanted facial hair, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I was always afraid to try an eplilator.  I read how much it hurts and there is something disheartening when reading about removing hair from the root.  Fear mounts when considering upper lip and chin hairs - such a delicate place!  However, I grew tired of &amp;#34;plucking&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;waxing&amp;#34; so I thought I should give this a try.  Where has this been all my life?  I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt half as much as you may read and it works like a charm!  Just follow the directions - don&#x27;t apply too much pressure and keep the skin taut.  It is easy and quick and the hair will be gone for four to six weeks.  I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Who thinks of these things?&lt;br /&gt;Works great and would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Of course this was used by my wife and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. I love it. You could not find anything better. The price is good. It really truly works</li>
    <li> What a great little tool.  Every woman should have one.  It will sting a bit the first few times, but it gets better (or I got used to it) and I love the results. I used it on the little stranglers that appear on my chin now and then and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> does not work very well.  A waste of my money.</li>
    <li> A  so inexpensive!  Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous for upper lip and chin. You do it less and less over time.&lt;br /&gt;Pinch&#x27;s a bit at first.  After several uses you don&#x27;t feel it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge wimp regarding pain!  Slight discomfort not pain&lt;br /&gt;Best purchase ever!</li>
    <li> i love it thanks.. i had another brand for over 10  years and it was getting really old</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend because she liked mine. She loves it. Received it very quickly.</li>
    <li> seems to work well she says it does the job and has  made things easier good item to buy now</li>
    <li> This epilator does nothing.  Its very loud and does not remove any hair at all. Total waste of money. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> No more waxing lips and chin. Super money saver. Will order a second one for back up. Light weight and great size to carry in purse. Even keep one in work locker or desk drawer.</li>
    <li> This thing pulls out each hair...it is painful, I would never buy it again nor would I advise anyone else to buy it in the first place..</li>
    <li> I have white facial hair that cannot be removed by Laser. It has been tedious tweezing for a two hour period, twice a week. Since using the Epi Slim, the time I spend on hair removal has been reduced to a half hour twice a week and I think it will be reduced even further as the cycles of hair growth complete. My facial hair is much easier to manage, there is no irritation to my skin as happens when I use depilatories and it is no more painful than tweezing. It is easy to use and i can apply makeup almost immediately after using. My only concern is that the hair has to be fairly long for the Epi Slim to be effective, but considering all the products I have tried, this product has worked better than anything else for me. I recommend this product for facial hair removal. It has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> leaves red rashes on your skin and misses the majority of the hairs.  The pain is not that bad though.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product over a year ago. it has work well for me. i would recommend this product to anyone. it keeps my facial hairs gone.</li>
    <li> Have to go over several times to remove fine hair, so not as happy with it as the reviews posted.</li>
    <li> A LIL PAINFUL BUT PAIN IS BEAUTY, NO HAIR WHEN FINISHED</li>
    <li> I just really love this product. easy for travel, and easy to use On bikini area , and/or upper  lip</li>
    <li> as long as the battery is strong, this does a heck of a job</li>
    <li> I love this device. It is just the right size. It does not always pull hairs. Sometimes it breaks the fine hairs but overall does a good job.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a month now... works amazingly well, leaves no stubble, clean look and yes, it is painful as any epilator would be on sensitive areas&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I can definitely see no in growth: an issue which I constantly struggled with shaving&lt;br /&gt;  It leaves no marks on skin and does not cut (I have sensitive skin and trust me everything cuts!)&lt;br /&gt;  The growth is much slower (need to use it only once in a couple of days)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Yes! it can be painful... for first pass do a small portion at a time.. but no more painful than a standard epilator</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t recommend product or purchasing from this buyer</li>
    <li> I switched from waxing to epilating my legs about a year ago and will never go back. Epilators make life a lot easier for us fuzzy folks -- we don&#x27;t have to shave daily, don&#x27;t have to deal with sticky home wax products, and don&#x27;t have to spend time and money on professional waxing. I use the Philips HP6401 Satinelle Epilator and am very satisfied with it as a leg epilator, so I hoped the Emoji AP-9L would be equally effective for bikini-area hair management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the Emjoi AP-9L has 2 significant, related design flaws. The area of the device beneath the pinchers is not well-sealed, and bits of hair get stuck inside the device. Customers are provided with a small brush for removing hair and that helps somewhat, but it seems like a certain amount of hair will always escape into the device, which, I suspect, could interfere with performance later on. Additionally, the angle of the pinchers seems not quite ideal for grabbing hair and I&#x27;ve noticed that it works better on hair that&#x27;s quite a bit longer than my Philips requires. This means that the hair that gets stuck in the device amounts to more volume than necessary. (Note that all epilators require a minimum hair length [similar to waxing] but it seems that the Emjoi AP-9L&#x27;s minimum length is longer than optimal.) Because of this longer-than-ideal minimum hair length, the Emjoi doesn&#x27;t get an area as cleanly shaven as I&#x27;ve come to expect with my Philips. It&#x27;s possible that after several full epilations, once hair has thinned out, the left-behind-hair will be less noticeable, although still long enough that I suspect tweezing would be in order, which would defeat the purpose of epilating.</li>
    <li> First time users will find any epilators painful so do expect that. On the other hand,  the emoji epislim removes hairs very well and leaves the areas you&#x27;ve removed hair from smooth for a long time. I recommend with this and any epilator to put a cream on to reduce the irritation and redness.  Only downside I have is the fact that it runs only on batteries. If it had a plug in feature as well, id give it a 5 star :)</li>
    <li> This little gem works very well at removing facial hair.  Just be sure to hold it at the proper angle according to the directions.  I didn&#x27;t find it painful at all but then, I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of electrolysis.  Definitely worth the money and a perfect size for travel.</li>
    <li> Nice compact epilator.  Works well on fine and coarse hair. There is a bit of pain when using, but not any worse then waxing. I&#x27;ve had it about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t had to replace the batteries. There is a slight learning curve to using it. I&#x27;ve found that I have to hold it at more of angle then with other bigger and more expensive epilators that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS!  I WISH I WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED THIS 50 YEARS AGO!!!!  IT WORKS GREAT, MY SKIN IS SMOOTH AND HAIRLESS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.  THOSE FRENCH GENES HAVE BEEN MY ENEMY FOR YEARS AND NOW I TELL THE FACIAL HAIR GOOD-BYE.  LOVE IT.  PAINLESS WITH SMOOTH RESULTS THAT LAST QUITE A WHILE.</li>
    <li> I originally saw this on a low-quality youtube video, where a girl was using it on her legs and face(so I thought).  After buying this product, I realize that girl in the video did not have this device turned on, and had very likely never really used it.  When I turned on this device it was unexpectingly loud, and quite intimidating.  I used it on some fine hairs on my hands and it did a good job plucking them.  I tried on my forehead where I had a few thin white hairs.  It didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I expected, and then about a week later they were grown back and thicker, it was then I realized it wasn&#x27;t plucking but breaking them.  I have since stopped using it.  For certain areas of the body(mainly legs or arms) I could see this product working for someone.  It all really depends on your type of hair.  On long, thick hairs, I found it would usually cause the device to come to a halt, then finally yank or break the hair(I speculate this will eventually burn the motor up).</li>
    <li> Emjoi Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- convenient&lt;br /&gt;- travel friendly&lt;br /&gt;- does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- loud whirring sound&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t work for fine hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: EXCELLENT, for thick coarse hairs</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these products.  I bought the first one locally and when it finally gave out, the local store didn&#x27;t carry them anymore.  It&#x27;s a great product ... I use it on my eyebrow area just below my eyebrows where the really fine little hairs grow.  (Make sure you put your finger over your actual eye brows though or you&#x27;ll lose those too!)  I also use it on other face areas to get rid of fine hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well on single thick hairs as it grabs indiscriminately with about 3 rotating &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;.  Single hairs I still use a normal tweezers but I really like this for fine hairs under my eyebrows and other areas of the face (chin, under chin, etc.)  There is a pulling sensation but it is mild discomfort at most.  If you put your finger over your eyebrow then pull the skin taught, pulling straight up toward your forehead, your skin will not get pinched in the process.  In short, this product does work, and it&#x27;s minimal discomfort for maximum hair removal.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan. The pain wasn&#x27;t awful but the process was annoying. It wouldn&#x27;t pick up some of the coursest hairs on my chin. I kept having to go over the same area. It made my skin irritated and I even broke out afterwards. Choose a different method.</li>
    <li> Purchased on a whim &amp; with curiousity. The product works as staed but does pull a little more than anticpated - over all a good product</li>
    <li> I use this mainly for underarms. At first I had to get used to the angles at which it works. If you are a first time user, please be aware that it hurts, but over due time the pain lessens and you&#x27;d just feel a plucking sensation. I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and I&#x27;m never going back to shaving. Since your hair grows at different rates, it takes about 3-4 times before you can go a week without epilating. Because the hair has to regrow from its roots, the tip of the hairs become finer and less noticeable unlike the regrowth after shaving. It only takes 2-3 minutes per underarm and I never have to worry about wearing sleeveless blouses if I had gone without shaving for a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to like this or not.  I don&#x27;t think I hate it but I&#x27;m a female with heavy facial hair which I shave off at least twice a day.  So when I used this item it didn&#x27;t catch the hair.  That broght me back to this site to check if the hair needs to be a certain length and yes....1 to 2&amp;#34;!!  Well that will never work as I would have to stay hidden away for a few days.  I&#x27;m very discouraged and will give it another try then return it.  Any suggestions?  Anyone out there use the NoNo?  I&#x27;ve read so many negative reviews on the NoNo and it&#x27;s so expensive that I have not invested in trying it.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> IT WAS HORRIBLE ,,IT HURTED LIKE HELL AND TO INJURY TO INSULT I WOKE UP WITH RAZOR BUMPS ,AS THOUGH I WAS A MAN YUK AND IT FEEL LIKE RAZOR BLADES ON YOUR FACE AND LEGS</li>
    <li> this is not painnful at all and it works like a charm, I use it once per week and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for the face, bikini, and underarm areas. It has a very powerful motor for it&#x27;s small size and takes 2 AA batteries which last quite a long time between changes. I have had mine for 3+ years and it still works just as well as the day I bought it. It also has a great price, especially if you are not looking to epilate your legs and don&#x27;t need to spend $50-60 on a larger unit.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is perfect for small area such as facial, under arms and arms or any touch ups, it reduces the amount of hair. It is quite painful at first but then you get used to the little stings, just trim or keep the haur short and there will be less pain. Keep the blade clean and area that you will be using the product clean also and there will be no irritations.</li>
    <li> I have always had a lot of hair on my face.  Being a woman, I was always embarrassed by this.  I&#x27;ve tried tweezing, bleaching, hair removal creams, electrolysis, but I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with any of those methods.  The methods either burned and irritated my skin, the hair grew back too fast, or in the sun, the bleached hair showed up like a beacon.  I considered laser hair removal, but I found out the cost was more than I could afford.  I have used an epliltor on my arms for about 20 years, and it was the best thing I ever did.  I am at the point that the hair hardly grows back anymore.  I only have to do my arms about once a month now, just for touch ups.  How I wish I would have started my face, when I started my arms.  I guess the reason I never tried it on my face, was because the epliator heads are too big to get in all the small areas of my face.  One night, I was looking on the internet for a new epilator for my arms, and I came across this little gem.  I, of course researched it and found mostly positive reviews.  I though I would give it a try.  I love it!!  It got rid of all the course hair, and all the \\&quot;peach fuzz.\\&quot;  My face actually looks ten shades lighter without all the various hair that was all over my face.  It does hurt at first, but after a couple of times, you hardly feel it.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in a plug in model.  I have to change the batteries quite often.  I use it about every three days or so, and it keeps my face hair free.  I still have to get a tweezers and pluck a few here and there, but I would rather do that than what I was doing.  I am so glad I found this.  I only wish that I would have started on my face a long time ago.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with an epilator and I like it a lot. It does cause just a little pain but it&#x27;s very bearable. Not as bad as with plucking.&lt;br /&gt;I might order a plug-in one later but for now am enjoying the handiness of this little machine.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to use and take with. Good, reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair and even directly after shaving I&#x27;d have a dark shadow on my underarms, so I decided to give epilation a go. I epilated my underarms this morning and I&#x27;m SO very happy with the results! Of course it hurt quite a bit, you&#x27;re pulling the hair out from its roots, but it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I expected. I recommend epilating on FULLY dry skin after a hot shower or bath, preferably in a cool room so that you don&#x27;t sweat or anything during the process. My armpits did bleed a little bit and there was some soreness/redness afterward but it went away quickly, and now my underarms look freakin fabulous. I have literally been running to sneak a peek at them at various intervals throughout the day and see how they are doing, and once the redness subsided they are amazingly smooth and the shadow I usually had after shaving was gone! Make sure you don&#x27;t put anything like deodorant or lotion (and I mean ANYTHING) on your skin for a few hours afterward - you don&#x27;t want to irritate it further. I also made sure to exfoliate beforehand and THAT was a good decision - I hardly had any ingrown hairs! Overall I say if I can get results this good on my first try, I can&#x27;t wait to see what I can achieve in the future. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I got this for under my arms, where it pulls out virtually no hair, even when I&#x27;ve shaved it to the length specified by the instruction manual. It does work minimally on my face, but it&#x27;s a pain to use and stops frequently.</li>
    <li> This item has a factory diffect .the battery holder o not comply with the way the battys installation.there for is not operable.worthless and a lost of money and time. Do not waste your money buying this item.</li>
