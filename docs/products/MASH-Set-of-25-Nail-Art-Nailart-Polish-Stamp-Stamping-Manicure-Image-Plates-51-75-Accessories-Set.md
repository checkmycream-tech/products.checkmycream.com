<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So many different designs to choose from, which is why i chose it! I love that it has nail tips or full nails or just small images so you could make your own tip or full nail design.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these when I use them. Images come out very clearly on most.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a total novice when it comes to nail-stamping. This kit has cute designs but I seem to only run to about 5 good ones. The designs that have a lot of negative space (area to pick up polish from) doesn&#x27;t work that well. It smudges and glides and thus doesn&#x27;t pick up the design well enough to actually stamp it. The designs with fine intricate lines work best. I use my konad double ended stamper for this, works great. I don&#x27;t like the blue film bc it rolls on itself and you have to struggle with your new pretty stamped not-yet top coated nails to unroll and stick back on the plate. Other than that, it&#x27;s good. There are some xl designs that couldn&#x27;t possibly fit on even a big toe, so cute-yes but functionality of all designs-no.</li>
    <li> Great selection of stamps, all work great</li>
    <li> If you have experience stamping, the set is nice with many cool designs. For beginners though, it is hard to use and takes lots of practice to get good at it. Almost impossible to use on yourself.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved all the neat designs.</li>
    <li> The designs are amazing. I love these plates! The only bad thing is I can&#x27;t decide which ones to use first!</li>
    <li> Most work well. Different polishes provide different results- experiment!</li>
    <li> What a waste of money. The entire concept doesn&#x27;t work as expected. The shapes are not crisp or clear.</li>
    <li> Love this set! It arrived quickly. Works great and the designs are adorable!</li>
    <li> this set is really good and works great the only problem people will have with this set is on the stamping plate that has &amp;#34;boom &amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;pow&amp;#34; or mirrored &amp;that not correct for word images so you would have to make a stamp decal to read it correctly it seems that there&#x27;s no replacement for it  b/c I already contacted Mash for a replacement and got the same plate</li>
    <li> There is a lot of variety in this stamp set and it works great! I have no trouble using it, great for beginners, too.</li>
    <li> Lots of different designs wish it had the cheetahs designs</li>
    <li> I rate this 3 stars because I have many stamping plates such as Pueen and Konad, but this set has too big of icons. Even for someone with long nails or larger nail beds they are should be scaled down. The background plates work nicely though! Overall happy!</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer said, there&#x27;s errors on these plates. Plate 57 one of the images (2nd row,image on the left) was almost completely damaged. Emailed the manufacturer and they said the entire lot was like that for that specific plate. I would suggest waiting before purchasing, so they can correct these errors. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> These plates are great, but i am missing quite a few. I got doubles of several and three of one. I cant recommend this set with such poor quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missing: 51, 58, 59, 60, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70&lt;br /&gt;Doubles: 54, 56, 57, 69, 71, 74, 75&lt;br /&gt;Three: 55</li>
    <li> MASH has made a few mistakes with the designs in the set as of early November.  Take a closer look at the product image and you may notice that the text on 2 images on plate 67 is reversed as is the script stamp of the word love on plate 54.  Rather than buying now, e-mailing about the mistake, and hoping for replacement plates in the future if they decide to remake those, wait for the messages from angry customers to get the set fixed.  Also, an image on plate 64 is duplicated on the plate and etched incorrectly.  3 glaring errors from a company I had bought from before and trusted for supplying a decent product is disheartening.  Such terrible quality control.</li>
    <li> These plates are so easy to use and stamp with. I wish it came with a holder but these plates have some great images on them. They are perfect for beginners and also veteran stampers. This was my very first set I purchased.</li>
    <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
    <li> The images are huge! Too big to fit on my nail. I do have small hands but never had this problem with other stamps</li>
    <li> I love most of these plates! There is still the issue with the plates being printed backwards, however if you stamp it, apply some top coat on top of the stamp before you apply it, let it dry, then peel it off the stamper and place it on your nail it works like a decal. other then that they are all very cute!!!!</li>
    <li> I have several plates from different manufacturers (Cheeky, Pueen, Messy Mansion, etc.).  On this set of plates, all of the images containing words are engraved  backwards, and many of the images are engraved too deeply to give a good, clean stamp--although it can be done if you&#x27;re careful and experienced with stamping.  If you are just getting in to stamping and you are inexperienced, you should look at the Pueen sets that come with a case, those work a lot better, IMO.</li>
    <li> My favorite plate with the &amp;#34;Boom!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Pow!&amp;#34; plates are made so that the letters stamp backwards onto your nails.  I was disappointed about that.</li>
    <li> Mash plates consistently stamp well. There is an issue with this set where the wording on some of the plates is backwards. I contacted the seller several times and was promised updated plates when they got them in, and each time was told &amp;#34;a couple of weeks&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soon&amp;#34; but have never received corrected plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like Mash plates and I would be giving this at least one more star if not for the backwards writing on a few of the plates and the fact that I never got replacements.</li>
    <li> This is a really fun stamping set. It has some interesting designs. My nails are long and wide naturally and these designs still cover my nail completely. I do have some trouble with the full designs not covering my thumb completely, but I don&#x27;t tend to stamp my thumb, so this is a non-issue with me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the designs included in this set of stamping plates. However, the plates that have word (#54 &amp; #67) have the words mirror imaged when they should not. This means that the words show up backwards on your nails. To work around this you&#x27;ll need to do a reverse stamping technique, for which there are several videos on YouTube. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the company hasn&#x27;t corrected this yet (I purchased these in April 2014). The mirror image error is the only reason I can&#x27;t give this set five stars.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was packaged well. Am looking forward to using these in my nail art. Will probably be ordering more at a later time.</li>
    <li> I ordered them last week and they finally got here and none of the plates were damaged and they also fixed the backwards problem with the POW and BOOM so now those are okay (:</li>
    <li> I personally love MASH nail art stamping image plates. They give a clean image and are less expensive than the leading competitor</li>
    <li> Love the variety of the plates! Good product.</li>
    <li> Awesome designs. Quality material. The full nail pattern requires some patience in lining up for wider nailbeds. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!! I used to waste so much time doing my nails and now you can have a design that takes like 5 minutes. Everything worked out perfectly for me when I tried the first time!! So many cute designs!! AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!!! Do not waste ur money on this. The stamping tool don&#x27;t even work. The scrapping thing is too sharp so it don&#x27;t even work. I wish I can get a refund!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and Value</li>
    <li> These were a great addition to my collection. I appreciate that there are pictures showing every single stamp so I could make sure I wouldn&#x27;t have doubles. The depth of the laser etch is perfect, it holds polish well and is easy to transfer to nails.</li>
    <li> I really like the set despite the words that are etched backwards, which can easily be fixed by different techniques when stamping. The plates I&#x27;ve tried seem to stamp well so far and my sister who&#x27;s just starting out is able to get them to work for her. All in all I feel its a good set that works for a nice and cheap price.</li>
    <li> This stampers were actually really good for it price. Normally if you were to buy tge olates seperately they would be $6 or $7 per plate so this is definetely a great deal, plus stamping is easy and i didnt have any problems with the plates being too sharp</li>
    <li> Cons: Plate 54 &amp; 67 are printed backwards and thus when transferred onto your nail it&#x27;s backwards and can&#x27;t be read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I really like the designs and quality of these plates - let alone the value!</li>
    <li> The shipping was excellent the product was as I spected to be no problem at all</li>
    <li> Received these today and sat down to test them right away (2 images from each plate one simple, one complex) and am very impressed. This is the first set I&#x27;ve purchased that did not have one defective plate! I figure as many sets as I&#x27;ve bought im due one :). The Celtic knot plate really drew me in but I also love the butterfly/leaf plate and the numerous geometric designs. My item shipped from Chatsworth California if that helps you determine how fast it may be delivered to you. I would recommend this set for beginner through advanced stampers. Don&#x27;t forget if your a beginner to pick up a stamper! I recommend Born Pretty Store and [[ASIN:B00CJIOG0Q Winstonia Nail Art Double Ended Large Stamp and Plastic Scraper Set]] as they perform different functions. Happy stamping!</li>
    <li> great, very good, I love it</li>
    <li> My  mother says these stamp wonderfully but the ones with words stamp backwards.  Mash offered a partial refund rather than replacement because  the defect is present  in all their stock.</li>
    <li> Love the set.  The few plates I have tried stamp well as the other collections.  The only issue I have is plate 54 and 57 words are backwards...  the only way to use, is to stamp on another surface,back paint and peel off in the decal fashion.  Its a bit of a pain and not for beginners.  Other than that, its a very  nice set.  I would have given it a 5 star if the word plates were reversed.</li>
    <li> I have had no problems with these, and all have stamped perfectly.  I&#x27;m really glad I found them, saved me a ton of money.  Worth the price, and lots of value.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed, get them!!!!!  :)</li>
    <li> Its ok but most of the images are for little kids. It varies between little cartoon monsters and gambling emblems which I have to say is a strange mix. I will have to give a lot of them to my daughter, although there are many I know she won&#x27;t even like.</li>
    <li> They work as expected. I had some defunct plates like the other reviews suggested, but it&#x27;s whatever. Nail stamping is a fun thing to try, and these plates do the job!</li>
    <li> i LOVE ALL THESE DESIGNS YES TWO NAIL PLATES CAME BACKWARDS BUT THE REST ARE VERY NICE. i THINK IS WELL WORTH IT BECAUSE BUYING EACH ONE SEPERATE COSTS WAY MORE.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and beautiful design. It comes with 25 as you can see in the picture</li>
    <li> I loved them the first time I tried them, the quality is great and my nails look beautiful, I bought the Konad  stamper.This is the first time I do my own nails and I am amazed about how easy is to do it. No more salon for me.</li>
    <li> I love these plates! The variety is amazing. The price is excellent. I have super short nails and the designs cover my entire nail--even my thumb--and then some! I&#x27;ve also used some of the smaller designs on my toes. All plates are etched deeply and the images transfer crisp and bold. I&#x27;m new to stamping, but thanks to the plethora of YouTube \\&quot;How-To\\&quot; videos I&#x27;ve had zero problems. 10/10 would recommend to beginners and experts.    Note: plates 54 and 67 are etched backwards. I still give this set five stars.</li>
    <li> love this product, use it every weekend, Makes for a Girls polishing party.</li>
    <li> These have a few issues with repeated designs and backwards etchings. Two patterns are repeated (plates 57 &amp; 72 have a matching pattern, plate 64 has a doubled pattern) and two etchings are backwards (the L&amp;#60;3ve symbol on plate 54 and the Chinese symbol for luck on plate 55). I contacted Amazon about these issues and they very kindly refunded me a third of the purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, these plates are great. They&#x27;re etched deeply, made of steel, paper backed, and they transfer very well.</li>
    <li> Hahahaha! Why didn&#x27;t I see it before? On some of the stamping plates the writing is backwords. I really didn&#x27;t think much of it until it was stamped on my finger. Hahaha! I&#x27;m laughing so hard right now! The other stamping plates are great though. I just can&#x27;t get over the fact that it&#x27;s backwords! Excusing my while I go into a laughing Coma. Hahaha!</li>
    <li> I love these plates, the images stamp very bold, clear and sharp, overall I am happy with this set.  On the other hand there are two plates that are defective that need to be corrected.  Plate No. 54, the script Love is backwards and also Plate No 67 with two images, BOOM and POW! are also backwards. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for those 3 image mistakes.</li>
    <li> Works awesome, I loved these plates. The shipping could have been faster but overall it was worth the buy</li>
    <li> Plates arrived quickly and with no damage. The images pick up easily and go on very nicely! My only negative is that the words are backwards on a couple of the plates, but for the price, I can look past it.</li>
    <li> These nail plates are really fun to use!  They take a little bit of practice if you&#x27;re not familiar with nail stamping, but I was able to get a perfect stamp after a couple tries.  There are so many fun designs!  I can&#x27;t wait to try them all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving these new designs from MASH.  Just like their other stamp plate collections, the images transfer clearly and the designs are attractive and unique.  It also seems like the images from this collection are slightly larger than plates 1-50, which I really like, since I have larger nail beds and prefer to keep my nails long.</li>
    <li> I have both pros and cons about these stamping plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;images were awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;some images wouldnt transfer all the way but it does take a few times to get  all of the image onto the stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, i really loves this. would recomend for a gift!</li>
    <li> The original set that I ordered got lost in the mail so I contacted the seller. She was quick to response and worked nicely with me. I ended up getting another set and they came within a week. The images come out okay, I recommend getting the konad stamper and scraper, it works much better. The plates are great though.love them :)</li>
    <li> All designs on plates are nice but I used then with my Konad scraper and it scratches the plates. Other than that these are great plates.</li>
    <li> Soooo many of these designs are basically unusable because they are either too large to fit on any of my nails, or they do not transfer crisp images.  I wouldnt recommend.</li>
    <li> These stamp beautifully on my nails, and i always get lots of compliments when I  use  them.  There are a good variety of images. I will buy more  MASH stamping plates in the future.</li>
    <li> Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t, know they shipped me a bottle of polish instead and have not heard anything about making it right</li>
    <li> I just got my plates...and they look great. The backward print everyone is mentioning is fixed. The stamps came in individual bags in a yellow envelop. I actually received them in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into stamping, this is a great set. And it&#x27;s super cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe invest in better quality stampers and scrapers, I use KONAD. But for just plates. 5 star. Well done MASH.</li>
    <li> I love the patterns, my fingernails look very pretty! The price is incredible...25 discs for 13 bucks, with free shipping! And every disc has 6 or even more patterns! I am going to buy more sets, for gifts! (You have to know this set doesn&#x27;t include the nail stampers and neither the piece to take out the extra polish, to be able to press the designs on your fingernails. You have to buy those things apart. This set just includes the discs).    ¡Esta oferta es excelente! Recibí 25 discos: cada uno incluye 6 o más diseños muy bonitos. ¡Pagué sólo $13 con el envío incluído, increíble! Mis uñas se ven muy bonitas. ¡Voy a comprar más juegos para regalar! Este juego sólo incluye los discos, no trae los sellos ni la piecita metálica que se usa para quitar el exceso de esmalte antes de usar los sellos. Ud. tiene que tenerlos ya o comprarlos por aparte. No salen muy caros.</li>
    <li> I loved the patterns and what not of the plates but there was some misprints not that much to make me return them but can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
    <li> Our granddaughter loved this set for her special and detailed manicures she give herself and sisters. We were pleased with the purchase and the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Love the plates. Great image quality and stamp fab. They have some great images on these plates. Highly recommend getting these plates. you wont be disapointed</li>
    <li> I just love love love these stamps, they have so many different designs on them and they are so easy to use!</li>
    <li> This is the first stamp set I&#x27;ve owned. I like the variety in the designs, some being more useful than others. It&#x27;s a good starter set.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of stamping discs. These are so nice. They stamp well and they have loads of options.</li>
    <li> Some designs don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> These plates are the regular size of most of the plates but the sigles are bigger that usual (perfect for wide nails) and the full nails are smaller in every way.&lt;br /&gt;My package was missing one of the plates :(&lt;br /&gt;Awesome designs, and aside from missing one plates, the rest of the plates were the same as the picture.&lt;br /&gt;the back of the plates is covered with a &amp;#34;paper type&amp;#34; sticker with the brand name but is not &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; as other brands so be careful to not leave nails polish stains in the back because otherwise it won&#x27;t go away</li>
    <li> I love it. it came pretty fast. i totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is O.K , Not much what I expected some flower designs. This set had only a few flower design which I don&#x27;t like that much .</li>
    <li> I really like this set.  The beach theme plate (M-59) the butterfly (M-61) aztecs plates (M-64, M-65) the safari plate (M-66)  bicycle (M-69) high heel shoe (M-70) and the anchor image (M-75) are my favorites.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Great images that stamp well!</li>
    <li> Worth it!!!!!!! Love them!</li>
    <li> I did not receive any of the stamps pictured in this set. A few of the designs are the same, but the entire plate does not match up. This is not at all as advertised.</li>
    <li> Items received partially damaged as they were not in any strong packaging and three plates were received bent.  The box they were shipped in was smashed and had an open slot on the site, were one may have fallen out and three were received bent. The designs were not that great so it was not a major issue for me, but still not happy.  The other plates have good designs and are fully functional.</li>
    <li> stampers are an effective tool for getting a great look easily. What I wish is that the dragon didn&#x27;t look so much like a ferret and that some of the designs are smaller. Most of them seemed pretty big and I have small nails. Transferring a partial pattern is ok if it&#x27;s a geometric design but for Chinese new year we did red nails with dragon ferrets and well as some kind of Chinese character letter and the letter was too big for my fingers so it ended up looking like a Christian cross on that nail. I took it off and settled for only the ferrets.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of plates here for a great price. However some of the images don&#x27;t transfer well. There are also a lot of images that I don&#x27;t personally like. I received some backwards images. The &amp;#34;Boom&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Pow&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; designs were all backwards. I&#x27;m not really complaining, the price is really good and makes up for the images that I didn&#x27;t really want anyways.</li>
    <li> holy smokes fast shipping! Great product! No damaged plates or reversed images as previous reviews stated!</li>
    <li> Love this stamping plate set, all images stamp well, I always use Konad stamping polish.</li>
    <li> I knew what I was buying thanks to the exact details of the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent plates. Full nail images and accent images. Well made. Stamps perfectly! Love them!</li>
