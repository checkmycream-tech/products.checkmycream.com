      <li>Ok, I absolutely, positively LOVE the scent of this soap!!!</li>
      <li>Jergens hand wash is easy on the skin and it has a wonderful cherry almond fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Agree, this is just a super hand wash with a great scent and excellent texture.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what else you can say, it is a good product.  </li>

      <li>This soap compliments the lotion nicely with an identical scent.</li>

      <li>This is such a great item!</li>
      <li>I wish it was a bit more fragrant because I love the almond smell</li>
      <li>We love it and will continue buying it.</li>
      <li>The bottle isn&#x27;t particularly handsome either (compared to the Method bottles).</li>
      <li>This is my FAVORITE hand soap.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap</li>
      <li>On the plus side, I love the cherry-almond smell...</li>
      <li>one of the reasons I tried this was because I really like the almond scent of [[ASIN:B000EEX7R0 Method Wood For Good Spray, 12-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)]]</li>
      <li>Liquid hand soap is about three things:  1) cleaning hands gently, 2) smelling great, 3) no-fuss product delivery (and decent looking bottle).  </li>
      <li>Jergens got it right with this one!</li>
      <li>so far it seems pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It came very quickly and very well packed</li>
      <li>I wash my hands often daily with it, brings back many good memories of my mother, long deceased ...    </li>
      <li>Thanks Jergens.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell of this hand wash.  </li>
      <li>#3 not so much because the product is so sticky it tends to leave sticky drips unless you wipe/scrape the excess after every hand pump.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for keeping the product and the scent alive!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent hand wash</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to smell</li>
      <li>I was looking for this after picking up Jergens Original hand lotion at my local big box retail store.</li>
      <li>The hand soap is gentle for daily use and does its job.  </li>
      <li>But then I went to the trusty computer and the internet to find it, and naturally, I could buy it through amazon.    </li>
      <li>I am a 67 year old (very) male that went hunting for this stuff, Jergens Cherry Almond Scent Hand Wash.    </li>
      <li>I am only disappointed that I cannot find this product in stores, but I am glad it&#x27;s available online.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, first squirts are nice and thick, but the last ones are too thin and watery.</li>
      <li>I have dry skin and wash my hands frequently.  </li>
      <li>It is worth the extra, small effort.</li>

    <li> This is my FAVORITE hand soap.  It&#x27;s creamy and moisturizing and has a wonderful cherry/almond scent...and I can&#x27;t find it in the store ANY place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it HERE!!!  Happy happy--joy joy joy!!</li>
    <li> I am a 67 year old (very) male that went hunting for this stuff, Jergens Cherry Almond Scent Hand Wash.    I had been looking for it oft and on for years, thought it was NLA.  But then I went to the trusty computer and the internet to find it, and naturally, I could buy it through amazon.    I wash my hands often daily with it, brings back many good memories of my mother, long deceased ...    Sometimes, just the aroma of something clings to the heart.    Thanks for keeping the product and the scent alive!!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and wash my hands frequently.  This soap keeps my hands from cracking.  And, the dispenser keeps the sink looking neat all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occupation &#x3D;  farmer</li>
    <li> I love this soap I can&#x27;t find it any where except on line.  I use it for shower soap and my skin feels great.  i have very dry skin especally in the winter. So with winter so close I want to stock up. Thanks Jergens.</li>
    <li> Liquid hand soap is about three things:  1) cleaning hands gently, 2) smelling great, 3) no-fuss product delivery (and decent looking bottle).  #1 and #2 are great; #3 not so much because the product is so sticky it tends to leave sticky drips unless you wipe/scrape the excess after every hand pump.  The bottle isn&#x27;t particularly handsome either (compared to the Method bottles).</li>
    <li> Sometimes you find a product that becomes a staple.  Agree, this is just a super hand wash with a great scent and excellent texture. It is never harsh on your delicate skin.  Many times a repeat buyer for years. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have always hated using moisturizing lotion because of the greasy feel and thus I always have exceptionally dry hands.  I wanted to try this soap for its moisturizing properties during the cold winter months and so far it seems pretty good.  The soap feels silky when it comes out of the bottle and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling excessively tight and dry after washing.  It leaves no residue nor does it leave your hands feeling greasy at all.  It was also a great value at the price.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, I love the cherry-almond smell...one of the reasons I tried this was because I really like the almond scent of [[ASIN:B000EEX7R0 Method Wood For Good Spray, 12-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)]] and this is just like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I did not find it especially moisturizing, and certainly not \\&quot;extra moisturizing\\&quot;.  I actually found my hands were dryer overall after I switched to this.  It&#x27;s a decent hand wash and I&#x27;ll finish the bottle, but in the future I&#x27;ll have to stick to cleaning my wood furnishings to get my almond-scent fix.</li>
    <li> Jergens hand wash is easy on the skin and it has a wonderful cherry almond fragrance.  We love it and will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this hand wash.  I wish it was a bit more fragrant because I love the almond smell but it is very nice.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this after picking up Jergens Original hand lotion at my local big box retail store. This soap compliments the lotion nicely with an identical scent. Jergens got it right with this one!</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to smell but I found the cherry almond scent very pleasant and not overbearing.  The hand soap is gentle for daily use and does its job.  I am only disappointed that I cannot find this product in stores, but I am glad it&#x27;s available online.</li>
    <li> Oh, the aroma!  Lathers wonderfully, and leaves you feeling so fresh!  The scent reminds me of marzipan!  This is such a great item!</li>
    <li> Ok, I absolutely, positively LOVE the scent of this soap!!! I have been looking all over for a body soap that smells like this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I prefer soap dispensers to bar soaps for washing hands, but I do not care for the ones I find in grocery stores and drugstores. The Jergens version suits me perfectly. I did learn that shaking the container prior to each use keeps the product evenly distributed. Otherwise, first squirts are nice and thick, but the last ones are too thin and watery. It is worth the extra, small effort. Also, I try to keep the cost down by checking the sellers&#x27; prices and shipping fees.</li>
    <li> This is my usual go-to hand wash soap although the first time that I tried the moisturizing one.....cleans...moisturizes...but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.</li>
    <li> THE BEST HAND SOAP ON THE MARKET. When markets stopped selling it, I bought it at the 99c stores. When they no longer carried it, I turned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it wasn&#x27;t the one pictured.  I actually wanted the one with the flowers on it.&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s empty, I put my dishwashing liquid in it.  Looks nice on the kitchen sink.</li>
    <li> Because of skin problems this is the only soap I can use for everyday and bath use.  I was having difficulty finding it here so was thrilled to be able to obtain it on-line.  It came very quickly and very well packed so it wouldn&#x27;t leak.  I am very happy with the service on this product.</li>
    <li> I like the almond scent.  I don&#x27;t know what else you can say, it is a good product.  I buy this regularly.</li>
