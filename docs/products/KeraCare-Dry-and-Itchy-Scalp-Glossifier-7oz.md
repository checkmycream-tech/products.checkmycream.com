    <li> I love this product for when I put my hair in a bun. I&#x27;ve had natural hair for almost 2 years. This is for edge control and itchy areas so if you&#x27;re looking for anything more yah that then this not for you.</li>
    <li> After 2 months, this product seems to be the best thing for my child&#x27;s hair.</li>

    <li> This product feels really good on the scalp and is pretty light and airy.  It really does help with the dry and itch scalp conditions.</li>
    <li> I use this overnight to get my scalp moistened but too oily for daytime use.  Its hard to use just as little without getting my hair too oily.</li>
    <li> Love this product and I use it on my scalp after washing with the dry and itchy scalp shampoo and conditioner. Definitely use on scalp and not hair as it will not add any moisture to your hair but will definitely keep your scalp from getting dandruff.</li>
    <li> Been using it for more that 3 years, it was recommended by my hairdresser (she is one of the best) it works for my dry and sometimes itchy scalp</li>
