### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good product for the price!</li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo!  </li>
      <li>I figure the best way to get the funk out of my hair was to leave the shampoo on for about 2-4 minutes then rinse.</li>
      <li>The 2 day Prime delivery is Awesome</li>
      <li>Anyway, I think it&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable product that, in no way, smells like bug spray.</li>
      <li>/&gt;A great shampoo!</li>
      <li>but still it is very good, works in an excellent way in the fight against dandruff.</li>
      <li>It also has a very pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>the price is excellent, some of these shampoos easily cost 4 or 5 times the amount.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used many shampoos over the years and I can honestly say this is one of the best.</li>
      <li>I tried the conditioner and liked it, I think this is a great brand.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very much enjoying this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>I am buying more as I type!</li>
      <li>Great tingly feeling while it&#x27;s getting rid of dandruff, but the mint is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Not too many suds and the mint scent was pleasant without overpowering.  </li>
      <li>A nice value</li>
      <li>This will probably not be effective for severe dandruff</li>
      <li>It really works and it smells great!</li>
      <li>It feels good on the scalp love the smell of mint and the tingling feeling.</li>
      <li>It does have a nice scent though and as I said, does work well.</li>

      <li>It does leave my scalp feeling a bit tingly, and I kind of like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t speak to how effective this shampoo is in that regard.</li>
      <li>liked this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>For years I have been stuck using prescription strength shampoo, and honestly that wasn&#x27;t even working the way I wanted.</li>
      <li>Best of all the hair looks good later!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ Lathers well and rinses out very easily</li>
      <li>I use it twice to make it even more nice when I shower.</li>
      <li>It cleans well, feels nice when used, and they really enjoyed the cooling sensation afterwards.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant to use and doesn&#x27;t have that super \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; smell that some shampoos have.</li>
      <li>I got it for my son and his dandruff is better, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any more effective than Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
      <li>It does do a good job of getting my hair clean.  </li>
      <li>This one worked great for my first bottle and I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>pretty great shampoo.  </li>
      <li>(Maybe it&#x27;s because I am woman, and it doesn&#x27;t like me. :-)  )</li>
      <li>its refreshing and works well.</li>
      <li>The contents are okay and does not harm my scalp</li>
      <li>wash my hair on a daily basis anyway as a morning ritual, so I have no issue with the \\&quot;for best results</li>
      <li>Their brand is okay, if you&#x27;re an athlete type of person.</li>
      <li>The scent is refreshing and not over-powering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly HEAD and SHOULDERS in the stores.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to purchase this shampoo, at WALGREENS.</li>
      <li>This is a good shampoo and the mint really feels nice when I let the shampoo stay in during my shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad he did.</li>
      <li>and I enjoyed the scent more as well.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this because it looks more discreet at the checkout line.</li>
      <li>This mostly fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>Added two more stars to the review.</li>
      <li>- I prefer it over some of the shampoos that are 5x more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They control flakes well for him, leaving his hair shiny and healthy feeling.</li>
      <li>Most of the eye-catching appealing &amp;#34;interesting ingredients&amp;#34; advertised or marketed on the bottle e.g. mint, ginseng, &amp;#34;Bio</li>
      <li>/&gt;He wishes he could stop breathing while using it as it also burns his throat, most noticeably the passageways where nose and throat meet.  </li>
      <li>I really like this brand of shampoo, smell great</li>
      <li>Pyrithione zinc can be a severe allergen for many folks which can cause respiratory discomfort.  </li>
      <li>Many experts now believe that dandruff is caused by a fungus.  </li>
      <li>this became the one they love.  </li>
      <li>men looking for a good value in their dandruff shampoo, this is definitely worth checking out.</li>
      <li>and I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why she feels that it smells like bug spray because I love it.  </li>
      <li>Most notably this shampoo/conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like an anti-dandruff product.</li>
      <li>My scalp gladly accepted this anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>This creamy shampoo has a light fragrance and feels nice on the hair.  </li>
      <li>I work out, so shower a couple of times a day most days.  </li>
      <li>A refreshing way to start the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shampoo has a nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>well I am happy to say that the Clear Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff shampoo works well for me!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a good general purpose mass-market shampoo (made by the multinational mega-conglomerate Unilever) that smells nice and can be used by women also.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product, and like the added ingredients it has and does give me a nice cool minty feeling after I shower.  </li>
      <li>In the end I have had no complaints and all things considered, the Clear Men Scalp Therapy product is great, we will be using it again.</li>
      <li>The Clear Men Scalp Therapy really does work, and it smells AWESOME!</li>
      <li>; so I need a strong shampoo, to keep the dandruff to a minimum.</li>
      <li>I also like that this shampoo does not carry a strong medicated odor to it.</li>
      <li>bottle was easy to grip in the shower but it was overly tall and didn&#x27;t fit easily into existing holders.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of treating dandruff but after a week of use my head gets used to it and doesn&#x27;t really help clean my head</li>
      <li>To End All Shampoos, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s fine shampoo, the cat-toy review didn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know the difference in formulation that makes this shampoo specified for men, but I find it more effective to control dandruff on my head than the Clear with lavender color that my wife uses. I now use it in my daily rotation.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that gives me a completely healthy scalp - with no dry patches at all.  I&#x27;m disappointed that it&#x27;s been pushed off the shelves of local stores, but glad it can still be purchased on-line.</li>
    <li> I have this on subscription. A quality shampoo. Primary benefit is no more itch! Dandruff shampoos may cure, but this is the shampoo for prevention and anti-itch. Mild and pleasant enough for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products (some costing 10x this) with no avail. One of my friends suggested this after seeing my problem on my shoulder. I&#x27;m glad he did. Since first use I have not had a spec of dandruff once. It&#x27;s been a year now and I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rewriting this because, somehow, my review of a cat toy was transmuted into a review of shampoo. While it&#x27;s fine shampoo, the cat-toy review didn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
    <li> My scalp gladly accepted this anti-dandruff shampoo. The contents are okay and does not harm my scalp so I don&#x27;t get dandruff just by using it. It&#x27;s ironic at first when I used another shampoo because it was the cause of my dandruff problems, even it being an anti-dandruff bottle.</li>
    <li> I found in my experience, that it worked better then Head N&#x27; Shoulders for my dry scalp and I enjoyed the scent more as well. The mint scent is only a background scent, but you can still pick it up, and it gave a slight cooling sensation to my scalp. If you&#x27;re looking for a dandruff shampoo and you feel Head n&#x27; shoulders doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well for you, you might want to give this one a try</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo!  It really works and it smells great!</li>
    <li> pretty great shampoo.  the whole hot shower but cool/menthol scalpe feeling is great.  Use it on my dog too</li>
    <li> I gave this a five star rating due to the fact that I had tried many different shampoos including head &amp; shoulders and within just a few hours hair just smelled terrible. Love the invigorating feel when applying and the long lasting fresh mint smell.I would recommend to anyone with same problem or just for a normal everyday use shampoo. The 2 day Prime delivery is Awesome</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry scalp, haven&#x27;t looked back since.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and the packaging allows you to get to every last drop of it!</li>
    <li> I really like this brand of shampoo, smell great, I have been a chronic user of Head &amp; Shoulders, but after a few year you want a change, this one seems to work just as well, and has a more current scent.</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s shampoo contains ginger, tea tree and mint.  In addition to cooling properties of mint and tea tree, it has anti-dandruff properties.  It comes in attractive dark green bottle that has wide base and can stand solid and stable in your shower.  Shampoo is mild and will not sting if it gets into eyes.  Mint fragrance is not over powering.  Personally, I feel that this shampoo can be used by both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like shampoo and conditioner in one, there is a variation available on the market from the same distributor.  You will notice that shampoo has green label, while shampoo and conditioner has grey label on the bottle.</li>
    <li> But she&#x27;s wrong.  I don&#x27;t know why she feels that it smells like bug spray because I love it.  She says it&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell.  Anyway, I think it&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable product that, in no way, smells like bug spray.</li>
    <li> I have never had an issue with dandruff so I have rarely used a shampoo designed for dandruff. I figured why use a pseudo-medicated shampoo if it is not needed? well I am happy to say that the Clear Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff shampoo works well for me! The scent is refreshing and not over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It does leave my scalp feeling a bit tingly, and I kind of like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The shampoo has a nice clean smell. It is not overpowering or unbelievably fruity. Personally, I dislike shampoos that smell like I washed my hair in Kool-Aid concentrate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My hair is on the oil side, but this shampoo neither over-dries my hair nor leaves it feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A nice value - I prefer it over some of the shampoos that are 5x more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - I really like the Clear Men Scalp Therapy, in fact it will likely be new long-term shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars</li>
    <li> Over the counter low-priced dandruff shampoo is pretty much over the counter low-priced dandruff shampoo. We have tried many different flavors and varieties and they all, basically, work the same. The thing that sets the shampoo apart, for me, from other shampoos is the fragrance. I love the way this shampoo smells, and I love the way my husband smells when he gets out of the shower after using it!! Who knew minty fresh wasn&#x27;t just for your breath? :-)</li>
    <li> This Clear scalp therapy shampoo/condtioner has pyrithione zinc for dandruff control, ginseng, natural mint, tea tree, among other things. It feels good on the scalp love the smell of mint and the tingling feeling. In the end I have had no complaints and all things considered, the Clear Men Scalp Therapy product is great, we will be using it again.</li>
    <li> Seems to work just as good as the regular head and shoulders.</li>
    <li> My husband enjoys this shampoo, but wishes it was a little more minty. We got a good deal on amazon and it was shipped super fast.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is generally my second choice when it comes to what works for my dandruff and itchy, flaky scalp.  I typically prefer T/Gel or shampoos containing coal tar or more active tea tree oil ingredients because they tend to work better with longer results for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I typically buy and use Clear throughout the year because it does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Clean masculine scent that I absolutely love&lt;br /&gt;+ Leaves hair feeling soft and clean and scalp refreshed&lt;br /&gt;+ Has a cooling and tingling sensation that isn&#x27;t overpowering&lt;br /&gt;+ Affordable&lt;br /&gt;+ Lathers well and rinses out very easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The active ingredient is the same as most other dandruff shampoos on the shelf.  This will probably not be effective for severe dandruff etc but in my case it works better than other no name white and blue dandruff shampoos of which there are probably hundreds!</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst shampoo I have ever used. It does a good job of treating dandruff but after a week of use my head gets used to it and doesn&#x27;t really help clean my head (take the smell completely off). I have to use this Shampoo in combination with another product to fully clean my hair. Pass, stick with Head in Shoulders.  1-21-16 edit: after a few months of use I figure the best way to get the funk out of my hair was to leave the shampoo on for about 2-4 minutes then rinse. Takes a bit longer, but works as an anti-dandruff and funk killer. Added two more stars to the review.</li>
    <li> Great tingly feeling while it&#x27;s getting rid of dandruff, but the mint is not too strong.  I use it twice to make it even more nice when I shower. Gave one to my son who had dandruff, and he loves it.</li>
    <li> By cool sport mint - they really really mean it. Gets rid of dandruff quickly. I am quite a big user of mint shampoos and highly recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you use this you get this nice cool sensation and the freshness continues for a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband has bad dandruff and eczema. We found some tea tree shampoo that worked well but cannot always find it. Then this came on the market, and he loves it. We both hate the medicinal heavy tar stuff. Still keep it around, but this is know his daily shampoo. Have it on &#x27;Save and Sub&#x27;. I am really happy.</li>
    <li> It really does work!  I could see the dandruf in my sons hair vanish after just a few uses.  It smells nice too no medicated smell at all like some other brands.</li>
    <li> Its is not the original. Oh boy! was I disappointed or what? It is not the right one i think.</li>
    <li> This works SOOOOO well for my S/O&#x27;s dandruff! SERIOUSLY we tried EVERY OTHER Type of anti dandruff shampoo BUT this has ALL of the ingredients of other treatments PLUS MORE ALL IN ONE! I would give it 5 Stars but we still see flakes, MUCH LESS! I am buying more as I type!</li>
    <li> Makes your head tingle and takes away the itch caused by bicycling too many miles with the same helmet.</li>
    <li> This is not the original its in a fake bottle do not buy</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo and the mint really feels nice when I let the shampoo stay in during my shower. Just wish there was a version that includes conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner in 1 product. Used Head and Shoulders for years, but I am much happier with smell and the quality of the Clear product.</li>
    <li> I know, this is just shampoo - but the lather it produces is fantastic!!!  I cannot believe how good this feels and with a minimal amount of eye irritation compared to the other shampoo I was using on a regular basis.  Overall, it performs very well and feels great when in the shower  -  really.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo for my scalp psoriasis.  The tea tree oil is the main ingredient I bought this shampoo for.  It seems to be keeping the psoriasis at bay on my scalp. Not sure why they labeled this &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s shampoo as I use it and love it.  I would highly recommend if you have the same condition as I have.  I use it every other day and leave on my scalp when I wash my hair for about 5 - 8 minutes, then I rinse it out.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1B3NWH2WCYL7S]]I&#x27;ve been using the Clear Men Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy line of shampoos for two years now. Dandruff is not so much of a problem for me anymore as I get older, but I do get a powdery snow when I tussle my hair if not treated. I&#x27;ve tried Selsun Blue, Head and Shoulders, and many many anti-dandruff shampoos in the past including prescription ones with coal tar, but this is the one that works now with my scalp chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair on a daily basis anyway as a morning ritual, so I have no issue with the \\&quot;for best results use daily\\&quot; recommendation. One bottle lasts me over 6 months, as I only need about a nickle-sized blob of shampoo. Give it a try. It may or may not work for you, as everyone is different. What works for one person may not work for the next, but for less than $5, you don&#x27;t have anything to lose. It&#x27;s still a good general purpose mass-market shampoo (made by the multinational mega-conglomerate Unilever) that smells nice and can be used by women also. There&#x27;s nothing specifically \\&quot;men\\&quot; about this product that precludes usage by women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the bottle design. It&#x27;s compact and easy to open. When you get down near the bottom of the bottle, you can twist off the cap and put it some water and shake it around to get the rest of the product out. (This also helps with rinsing the bottle for recycling.)</li>
    <li> I love it. Big enough and it has a cooling effect in my scalp and smells so light.</li>
    <li> Let me say straight out, I do not suffer from dandruff. As luck would have it, I was asked to test another anti-dandruff shampoo from a different manufacturer (to get the average user&#x27;s opinion), so I thought I would compare the two. I can say with confidence that Clear Scalp definitely left my hair in better condition than the competitor&#x27;s. While I would hardly call the result \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; or \\&quot;strengthening\\&quot; or anything like that, Clear Scalp did get my hair clean and it felt very natural after shampooing. I like the hint of mint that adds just the slightest tingle on the scalp. I used this for several days in a row, and did not have any noticeable ill effects. This is a reliable, safe, effective shampoo with a nice touch of mint and better conditioning traits than the average anti-dandruff shampoo. Assuming that it does control dandruff, this is a solid four-star product.</li>
    <li> Most notably this shampoo/conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like an anti-dandruff product. I got it for my son and his dandruff is better, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any more effective than Head &amp; Shoulders (same active ingredient). He loves the smell and reports that the tingling was \\&quot;a little bit shocking at first\\&quot; but isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> With its subtle and masculine cool mint scent CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY is the perfect choice for the male that wants to keep dandruff effectively at bay with a quality shampoo.  This product is designed to be used daily so it is gentle enough to use with each shower.  The ginseng, tea tree and natural mint really do give the user a cooling sensation when the product is applied.  One caveat this is just a shampoo so if the user wants more of a conditioning action  2 in 1 products which are also marketed under the clear men scalp therapy name may be what the buyer needs.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the more famous brand of dandruff shampoo, but after trying several different versions of this brand, I have to conclude that this shampoo is equally if not more effective than the famous brand. I love that there is big lather out of a little drop of shampoo, that the length of time my hair feels clean is much longer with this shampoo than with \\&quot;the other brand\\&quot;, and that my dandruff is actually very controlled and my scalp does not itch at all when using this brand. I also like that this shampoo does not carry a strong medicated odor to it. The cool sport mint scent is very tame and not overpowering. I think I&#x27;m going to permanently switch to this shampoo.</li>
    <li> The nice, minty scent is what sets this shampoo apart from some of the other anti-dandruff shampoos.  It is noticeable after a shower &amp; gives my spouse&#x27;s hair has nice, pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Dandruff Results: It seems to work just as well as the other over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoos.  This is a good choice for daily use if you don&#x27;t use a daily conditioner.</li>
    <li> If Clear uses a guy who has all that bacteria in his facial hair and every time he sneezes or has allergies, all that nasal fluid goes into his mustache and when Clear shows him using the scalp therapy shampoo, he does not even take a shower, YUUUUUKKKKKK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever seen under a microscope how much bacteria a hair has?  Do you think any woman is going to kiss that after they have seen a mustache hair under a microscope?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who wants a man sweaty from the extreme heat of the desert?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t they portray that they have a CLEAN therapy with a clean looking guy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing sexier than a recently showered, freshly shaven man smelling of cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No woman is going to use your products for women, if that man, sweaty from the extreme heat of the desert, is what you, yourselves think of your own products!</li>
    <li> This creamy shampoo has a light fragrance and feels nice on the hair.  It is a bit disconcerting to have the mint-tingle around the hairline but not on my scalp.  I have used it several times and it feels nice but the jury is still out about its anti-dandruff properties.</li>
    <li> This Clear \\&quot;Scalp Therapy\\&quot; anti-dandruff shampoo works well to control dandruff and has a pleasant, but not overpowering mint scent. We go through a lot of shampoo in our house since my teens both have very long hair and seem to spend more time in the shower than I remember doing at their age. That being said, we typically use \\&quot;Head and Shoulders\\&quot; (or a generic store knock-off) since that worked for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Clear shampoo is every bit as effective as what we had been using, leaving the hair and scalp feeling very clean while eliminating dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> I plead guilty to a bit of vanity about the full head of hair I have at age 79, and these products are especially valuable to me to keep a clean and fresh appearance.  I do like the minty odor and especially use it when I&#x27;m going out or have a special occasion.  Highly recommended as are all these products.</li>
    <li> While I occasionally have problems with dandruff and dry scalp, I don&#x27;t typically use a anti-dandruff shampoo.  They typically leave my hair with a medicinal smell and they tend to stain everything.  At least that&#x27;s what I remembered from the last one I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this shampoo.  Not too many suds and the mint scent was pleasant without overpowering.  A refreshing way to start the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was easy to grip in the shower but it was overly tall and didn&#x27;t fit easily into existing holders.</li>
    <li> High quality anti dandruff shampoo. Has a pleasant smell and lathers up nicely. A little bit goes a long way.  It works great too of course.  Haven&#x27;t had any flakes since using this product.  I have used many shampoos over the years and I can honestly say this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> I was not at all happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;There is no hint of mint in it at all for me.</li>
    <li> The active ingredient in this dandruff shampoo is zinc pyrithione.  The most commonly known shampoo with this anti-dandruff ingredient would be Head and Shoulders.  Personally, I have never found Head and Shoulders to be very effective, preferring Selsun Blue.  As far as the Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo, while it does have a pleasant mint scent and feels good while shampooing.....the results seem about the same as Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if Head and Shoulders works for you, but you want a change as far as a nicer scent, give this a try.  If Head and Shoulders has been ineffective for you, this product probably would not help either. I am not saying this product does not work, simply that since it is based on zinc pyrithione, if that works for you in another product, this should too, but if you haven&#x27;t had success with this compound in another shampoo, it is doubtful you&#x27;d find this shampoo effective.&lt;br /&gt;This product does have Vitamin E in it also, which should help moisturize a dry, itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent shampoo, a few \\&quot;botanical\\&quot; ingredients, nice scent, and it will work fine for some people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very much enjoying this shampoo!  Its got the same active ingredient as head and shoulders, and the scent is wonderful.  I also like the cooling sensation the mint gives you on your scalp.  It feels good, smells good, and works good.  What else could a person want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought the bottle looked kinda small, like I would run out right away, but it turns out that&#x27;s just the sleek design, as 12.9 oz of shampoo is actually quite a bit, and my bottle has lasted a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great shampoo!</li>
    <li> For years I have been stuck using prescription strength shampoo, and honestly that wasn&#x27;t even working the way I wanted. Finally I started trying out basic shampoos, to see if the market had caught up with the times. They have. The Clear Men Scalp Therapy really does work, and it smells AWESOME! You don&#x27;t leave the shower knowing that the smell of \\&quot;anti-dandruff\\&quot; is going to follow you around everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been struggling with dry scalp, and flakes on your work shirt everyday, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff...just some dry scalp from time to time. So I can&#x27;t speak to how effective this shampoo is in that regard. But I do like the scent and the consistency. It&#x27;s pleasant to use and doesn&#x27;t have that super \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; smell that some shampoos have. Overall I like it.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> My son had dandruff for two years and would scratch his head until he had sores..Saw this and decided to try for the price because even the $10 and $12 shampoos had not worked..After two weeks great results.I noticed he has stopped scratching and looked at scalp and it was completely clear...So Thank You</li>
    <li> Like this shampoo.  Has a mint smell and leaves a cool feeling on the scalp.  Keeps the dandruff under control.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my husband&#x27;s dandruff in check. It also makes his hair especially soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I used to be able to purchase this shampoo, at WALGREENS. But now; none of the locations that I am aware of, carry this shampoo. It&#x27;s mostly HEAD and SHOULDERS in the stores. Their brand is okay, if you&#x27;re an athlete type of person. I&#x27;m more on an office individual, so I need to smoothness that I get from CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY. It&#x27;s also cut down the dandruff, by a noticeable 40%. Even when I deal with the hard water in my shower. (I usually purchase a replacement filter cartridge, every 2 or 3 months). I lather up first, do my full shower routine while letting the shampoo sit, and then rinse it out at the end. And the bonus is, that the shampoo does not leave my hair dry. I like to wear a lot of Black and other dark colored dress shirts, etc.; so I need a strong shampoo, to keep the dandruff to a minimum. I think, that I&#x27;ll be increasing the quantity of shampoo purchases, to 2 per month.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now i wouldnt move to anything else. its refreshing and works well.</li>
    <li> When it comes to hair products, I&#x27;m a classic regular guy.  I work out, so shower a couple of times a day most days.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like Pepe Le Pew, I don&#x27;t have long lustrous locks like Captain Morgan, and I don&#x27;t need to have Politician&#x27;s Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is a no fuss, no muss shampoo.  I have been told that if I have a dandruff problem, it&#x27;s minor (thanks in no small part due to male-pattern baldness!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product basically hits all the marks I&#x27;m looking for.  I was worried about the \\&quot;Cool Sport Mint,\\&quot; which smacked of a potentially overpowering odor designed to appeal to jocks (or those who shop for jocks).  Five minutes after my shower was over, I didn&#x27;t smell a thing, so it can&#x27;t be too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as \\&quot;scalp therapy\\&quot; is concerned, that&#x27;s more of a gimmick than anything else.  My scalp feels the same as it does after \\&quot;non-scalp-therapy\\&quot; shampoos.  I suppose my dandruff remains under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the plus side, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily and behaves reasonably (within the parameters of my short haircut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this isn&#x27;t The Shampoo To End All Shampoos, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a stronger mint fragrance and \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling on my scalp after using this shampoo. It has a hint of faint mint and maybe tea tree, but really not much fragrance at all.  We have dandruff on and off during the year so I am hoping that this shampoo will solve the problem.  So far it seems to be working. It seems to have good cleaning ability, maybe a little bit too good since it leaves my hair a little dry. I&#x27;ve gotten around that by leaving my conditioner on a little longer, 2 minutes or so, and that seems to help.  It does do a good job of getting my hair clean.  We&#x27;ll have to see after a couple months what the long term effects of using it are, but so far we like it.</li>
    <li> Even though this is a shampoo for men I decided to give it a try. The shampoo on my head felt great, it had that cooling effect some mint shampoos and soaps have, yet the scent wasn&#x27;t overpowering. Since it was a hot day, August in New Orleans, duh, the cooling mint felt really good on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo isn&#x27;t harsh, it didn&#x27;t strip my hair and make it feel dry, just very clean and slightly tingly, not an unpleasant tingle or burn, just a nice soothing cooling tingle. I tried the conditioner and liked it, I think this is a great brand.</li>
    <li> I was eager to try this one because I had used the other brands but they can leave burn marks and red marks on your scalp and skin. I was intrigued by the commercial because it talks about working on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a former Marine so have had clipper cuts for years and need something to help sooth my skin after getting a hair cut. This one worked great for my first bottle and I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great (some of the others smell terrible like medicine) and it lathers great and left my hair soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the price is excellent, some of these shampoos easily cost 4 or 5 times the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is another in the line of Clear shampoos. It says it is cool sport mint, but I really could detect no mint smell, its fragrance is much the same as all the other Clear shampoos - one of a nice fresh smell. The dandruff deterrent seemed to work and what I noticed with this shampoo was less hair on my drain cover so maybe that means it is doing some scalp therapy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my complaints regarding this product remain the same. It is very pricey compared to other shampoos I use that accomplish the same thing and the bottle, which is designed to stand upside down in your shower so that all the contents can be used and that it dispenses easier, especially as you reach the bottom of the bottle - it seeps the shampoo out - just a little, but other products I use, do not have this problem.</li>
    <li> My husband used this shampoo for over two weeks, most times leaving it in his hair for several minutes.  This shampoo got the attention of his nose, eyes, and the skin on his head immediately.  I watched him make great effort not to breathe it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for results it both burns and cools the skin surfaces it touches.  The aroma is light and pleasant, not overbearing, but a little too manly (musk?) for his taste. Personally I thought it smelled nice for a man&#x27;s shampoo.  While using, he had to remember to shut his eyes to avoid the burning sensation from the airborne chemicals in it from getting to his eyes.  My own eyes were effected being in the same room as the shower steam but I&#x27;m also sensitive to things like smoke and onions cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wishes he could stop breathing while using it as it also burns his throat, most noticeably the passageways where nose and throat meet.  The burning sensation is very mild, but definitely there.  The burning and cooling sensation on the scalp doesn&#x27;t dissipate even after dried off - it keeps working.  Overall, the shampoo works as expected with no dandruff, itchy scalp or otherwise, and his hair (what&#x27;s left of it - balding issue, genetic, not from using this product!) is left feeling soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He gives it four stars but still prefers Head &amp; Shoulders which he said does the same thing, but without the manly smell, or burning chemicals.  So I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re on the sensitive side, look for the ones without the \\&quot;cooling sensation\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to use an Anti-Dandruff shampoo but my husband does. He&#x27;s been using this for awhile and has been very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washes well, rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t have that strong chemical smell that some of the other anti-dandruff shampoos have (and you know who you are...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the style of bottle and the fact that it can stand upright, always keeping the opening of the bottle packed with shampoo to the last use. Easy snap open top that seals tight without leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recommended, affordable, anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> My husband has mild dandruff which is very treatable using pyrithione zinc shampoos. He&#x27;s also very picky about shampoo. He claims he&#x27;s not, but any time I&#x27;ve gotten him brands like Selsun Blue or Head and Shoulders, it goes unused. He prefers shampoos which are more like regular shampoo to the ones that are clearly treatment for dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So trying a new brand is always iffy, but he&#x27;s tried a few of the Clear shampoos and does like them. They control flakes well for him, leaving his hair shiny and healthy feeling. This one is not a 2 in 1 but is still a fairly moisturizing shampoo so his hair is manageable, it also clears the product he uses out of it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is less minty than other minty shampoos, but there is a nice, mild tingle from it that&#x27;s pleasant to feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I didn&#x27;t have a dandruff problem when I first got this product.  In fact, I never have.  I had snatched up some of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoo and Conditioner mainly because I needed some shampoo and I&#x27;m not tied to any particular kind, so I was willing to give anything a try.  Then I decided to get this one since I&#x27;m a fan of the Cool Sport Mint smell.  I have a problem though.  I now have dandruff.  This is very strange, especially since this product is specifically supposed to combat against this particular problem.  Now, after a month of using this product I have a drier scalp than I ever have and my hair is actually oily, which is a common problem I have always had, but now it&#x27;s worse than ever and I can only point a finger at this product since it is all that has changed in my hygiene regimen.  It appears that this isn&#x27;t the norm for the majority of reviewers here (although I see that Enna Isilee had a similar experience to mine).  Maybe it&#x27;s not dandruff.  Maybe it&#x27;s residue from the shampoo itself that doesn&#x27;t rinse out of your hair, but either way, this is distressing and irritating since this has never been a problem for me before.  I&#x27;ll be buying a different bottle of shampoo and throwing this one in the trash.  I did, however, enjoy the smell of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using Head and Shoulders \\&quot;forever\\&quot;.  I have moderate dandruff and no matter what, even with Head and Shoulders I still occasionally get flakes now and then.  When I saw Clear was available, I decided to give it a try.  It has the same active ingredient and strength of Pyrithinone Zinc (1.0%) that Head and Shoulders contains.  I enjoy this product, and like the added ingredients it has and does give me a nice cool minty feeling after I shower.  It smells nice, and the feel of the shampoo is nice on my head as well. I will continue to use this product in the future.  Since it has the same ingredients as H&amp;S, I guess it just depends on what I find on sale when I am looking for shampoos.</li>
    <li> This dandruff shampoo is double effective, just as advertised.  First, it handles all the cleaning, softening, and maintenance, aspects of what a&lt;br /&gt;shampoo needs to do.  Then, it also has helped with minour scalp-drying &amp; flaking.  It also has a very pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For men looking for a good value in their dandruff shampoo, this is definitely worth checking out.</li>
    <li> When my teenage sons finally outgrew the AXE for Men stage (this generation&#x27;s OLD SPICE) this became the one they love.  Far more effective, practical and not NEARLY the slutty man-child stench of AXE.</li>
    <li> Manufacturers with big advertising and marketing budgets (like Unilever) have a distinct advantage in casting a very wide net to attract the gullible. I have tried at least thirty different dandruff shampoos over the years and most with only marginal and very temporary (2 days) results.  With this being said, I decided to try Clear Men Scalp Therapy and report my individual results as someone who has seborrheic dermatitis i.e.dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;2. Ergonomically-designed bottle-easy to grip in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;3. Lathers quickly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;4. Thick, dense shampoo cleans hair effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is a mass-market &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; item.  Most shampoos are predominantly water and sodium-based compounds with negligible active ingredients.  In the case of Clear Men Scalp Therapy, this is also valid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There has been a volume of research on the causes and cures for dandruff.  Many experts now believe that dandruff is caused by a fungus.  As such,  stronger broad-spectrum antifungals such as 1-2% ketoconazole have been shown to be far more effective than OTC preparations like 1% pyrithione zinc (Clear Men Scalp Therapy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The active ingredient is 1% pyrithione zinc-too negligible in concentration to be truly effective in addressing persistent dandruff (unless used daily which is exactly what the manufacturers want you to do).  In fact, many competing brands have similar (but not identical) ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Pyrithione zinc can be a severe allergen for many folks which can cause respiratory discomfort.  Discontinue use if you experience such symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Most of the eye-catching appealing &amp;#34;interesting ingredients&amp;#34; advertised or marketed on the bottle e.g. mint, ginseng, &amp;#34;Bio Nutrium 10&amp;#34; etc. are inactive ingredients and do virtually nothing in addressing the purpose of considering such a shampoo in the first place, either by function and/or concentration.&lt;br /&gt;For example, Tea tree oil, known to be somewhat effective in addressing dandruff is nearly last on the long list of ingredients and subsequently in its ability to be effective in this preparation.  Keep in mind that ingredients are listed in order of concentration and predominance-The first ingredients are more plentiful than the rest, and this is true for any product sold, whether a food product or health and beauty aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Unilever has also utilized a clever marketing strategy to avert conspicuous disclosure of its ingredients at the point of sale.  In order to view the ingredients, you must find and peel off the label on the back of the bottle. In my opinion, inconvenient at the least and sneaky at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Only marginally effective when used according to the directions and no more effective than Head &amp; Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;2. Far more effective alternatives requiring less frequent use exist in this market.  For persistent, chronic dandruff consider:&lt;br /&gt;  OTC (Over The Counter):  Nizoral A-D  (Mc Neil Labs)&lt;br /&gt;  OTC: Selsun Blue&lt;br /&gt;  Rx:  Nizoral 2.00% Solution  (Ketoconazole-A broad-spectrum antifungal agent)&lt;br /&gt;  Rx:  Coal Tar Solution 2.00%and/or concentration.&lt;br /&gt;For example, Tea tree oil, known to be somewhat effective in addressing dandruff is nearly last on the long list of ingredients and subsequently in its ability to be effective in this preparation.  Keep in mind that ingredients are listed in order of concentration and predominance-The first ingredients are more plentiful than the rest, and this is true for any product sold, whether a food product or health and beauty aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.

    <li> the best shampoo ive used so far, ive tried about 3-4 different kinds</li>
    <li> I got this for my boys and although they really do not have a dandruff issue, they said this shampoo \\&quot;does the job\\&quot;. It cleans well, feels nice when used, and they really enjoyed the cooling sensation afterwards. Best of all the hair looks good later!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this and says it works well. It does not at all smell like mint so if that is one of the reasons for purchasing this shampoo...don&#x27;t. It does have a nice scent though and as I said, does work well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandsons and it works really good for their dry scalp. They are always exposed to the sun because they play football and nothing worked before until this product.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this shampoo looks to me just like a Head&amp;Shoulders Mint variant of the anti dandruff shampoo that I was used to in Europe. The scent is very nice indeed. I don&#x27;t like the cap that much but still it is very good, works in an excellent way in the fight against dandruff. I use it twice a day, but I think even once a day does the job very well.</li>
    <li> I have had light dandruff and \\&quot;beardruff\\&quot; for at least 10 years and never did anything about it because I thought Head &amp; Shoulders was nerdy. I decided to try this because it looks more discreet at the checkout line. After using it every day for one week, my dandruff was all but gone. I don&#x27;t think you can ever be 100% dandruff-free, but this is very close. The directions say use at least two times per week, but I am going to keep using it daily as insurance.</li>
    <li> I had been using a prescription shampoo for skin issues and saw this on a deal on Amazon so I thought I could give it a try. It works amazingly and I only use the prescription shampoo every month or so now. Saves me money on the prescription nad this stuff works great with a nice minty tingle on my scalp. Very good product for the price!</li>
    <li> I get dandruff in the winter due to my skin drying out in when the heat is on. I wanted something that didn&#x27;t smell so &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; and also had a reasonable price. This mostly fits the bill.  It seems like a great shampoo and I use it daily even during the summer when I typically don&#x27;t have dandruff. The smell is kind of bland, not chemically but certainly not minty(a plus honestly lol). I have tried other scents in this line and to me they all smell the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Controls dandruff, does not smell like perfume, manly non-chemical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything really, some may see this as a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Good mens dandruff shampoo at a great price.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great as a everyday hair and Scalp cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Been using CLEAR for two years and it has cleared up&lt;br /&gt;scalp conditions I thought I&#x27;d never get rid of.</li>
    <li> I enjoy products that use mint in their fragrance. This is a very good shampoo with a slight scent of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathered up well (I only needed a small amount), and the invigorating scent made showering a sensual experience. This is another men&#x27;s product that women can also enjoy.</li>
    <li> Although I am not a man, I gave this shampoo a try. It smelled nice, worked on the very few flakes I had, but stung like boy howdy! Even after a long, long rinse, I felt as if my head was on fire. The burning lasted for hours, so I didn&#x27;t give the shampoo another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the bottle had the most intelligent, easiest to use cap that I have ever seen on a bottle of shampoo, bar none. A press on the side of the cap is all that is necessary to open the bottle, and it&#x27;s easy to use even with my eyes shut and with soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only the shampoo didn&#x27;t cause me extreme pain. Too bad. (Maybe it&#x27;s because I am woman, and it doesn&#x27;t like me. :-)  )</li>
    <li> Husband didn&#x27;t like it. He said it made his scalp itch and flake.</li>
