      <li>I was hoping I was ordering the right powder foundation</li>
      <li>I only apply once in the morning but it works great if you have oily skin and need a retouch later in the day.</li>
      <li>but I expected more.</li>
      <li>As described, fast shipping</li>
      <li>so I can really buy &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this mineral powder and their eye concealer.......</li>
      <li>I have a normal but sensitive skin type.</li>
      <li>I normally use bare minerals and this product broke my skin out.</li>
      <li>Suprisingly, Mary Kay has proven to be comparable to Bare Escentuals.  </li>

<li> It does not seem heavy on my face and hides the wrinkles!</li>
<li> It goes on very heavy, even after tapping the brush out.</li>
<li> But, due to the economy, I can no longer afford expensive make-up.  </li>
<li> I know it&#x27;s expensive makeup</li>

    <li> It was a little too dark for me but It was great for contouring!</li>
    <li> It goes on very heavy, even after tapping the brush out.</li>
    <li> I normally use bare minerals and this product broke my skin out. Does cover well but not for me.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying what the mineral powder beige 2. When I received the product got was a sample of something else. I am VERY dissatisfied with my purchase!! I was not given a return label to send the product back.</li>
    <li> Wife enjoying her make up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different mineral makeup foundations. I like them better than liquid foundations because they give me a more natural look. The Mary Kay product is okay.  The Pros--nice sifter jar, the amount of product for the money is generous, it blends well.  The Cons--doesn&#x27;t cover imperfections well; the coverage is only so-so. I felt like I had to apply a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and this is a perfect powder for everyday use. Gives the face a nice fresh look. Not heavy or thick. Very light and natural.</li>
    <li> I ordered beige 2 and got beige 1. This was a wate of my money. All of the other things in my order are great</li>
    <li> When I received this powder it was not the color shade I&#x27;m use to it was so darker than the original :-(</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation.  I have tried other brands and forms, but this is definitely the best.  It does not seem heavy on my face and hides the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I was hoping I was ordering the right powder foundation&lt;br /&gt;I was out and needed it I love Mary Kay thank you.</li>
    <li> Great person to do business with!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Bare Escentuals.  But, due to the economy, I can no longer afford expensive make-up.  I have pretty sensitive skin so I can really buy &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; drug store quality make-up.  Suprisingly, Mary Kay has proven to be comparable to Bare Escentuals.  It also doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.  I&#x27;m not all about Mary Kay but I really do love this product!  I highly recommend this mineral powder and their eye concealer.......only Mary Kay products I use and absolutely love! :)</li>
    <li> I have a normal but sensitive skin type. A friend got me into trying Mary Kay few years ago. Love their line of products!</li>
    <li> My only makeup I wear</li>
    <li> I received my product and it was just what I wanted. The product met my expectations as the seller described it and I am very satisfied with my product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I only apply once in the morning but it works great if you have oily skin and need a retouch later in the day.</li>
    <li> Nice twist shut cover inside.</li>
    <li> love MK products always use their foundation and mascara can&#x27;t go wrong this product is great and i got what i needed</li>
    <li> Probably a good product for other people but not for my super-sensitive skin.  I was looking to replace my loose powder that Mary Kay has now discontinued but did not notice this said foundation powder.  But it is the minerals my skin cannot take.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service</li>
    <li> I have been using this foundation for many years, I&#x27;ve tried others and always come back to Mary Kay, the finish is smooth, coverage is great, perfect color for me and has the best natural results. I then apply a bronzer lightly over this and the color and finish are spectacular, for bronzer I use Guerlain or Nars, also my 2 favorites. Great price and great service, thanks.. :)</li>
    <li> I love this color and blends well with my skin tone. Love Mary Kay. Powder Lasts long time too. Always try to catch sales on their products.</li>
    <li> This powder is good - I&#x27;ve been using it now for a number of years.</li>
    <li> For one the color was darker then I expected and the container was very very small I know it&#x27;s expensive makeup but I expected more.</li>
    <li> As described, fast shipping</li>
