### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The shakes are extremelly filling and the bars are excellent.</li>
      <li>We both are 10-15 pounds over what we feel best at.  </li>
      <li>packaged arrived within days of ordering it with no problems at all, and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>It is a great product if you follow the instructions to a tee.</li>
      <li>and it all tasted great.</li>
      <li>For the price of Reset, it is just too pricey for me and even that does not keep me successful anymore.</li>
      <li>I lost about seven pounds and now that I&#x27;m done I haven&#x27;t felt this good in years.</li>
      <li>I would have punched somebody in the face for a slice of pizza (though to be fair</li>
      <li>Unless you have the WILLPOWER to follow the program for 5 days, then Good for you.</li>
      <li>very pleased.</li>
      <li>Great gluten free products</li>
      <li>First off, I lost five pounds with this kit, which is great.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t take more than 2 sips; I put it away and followed w/ a lot of water.  </li>
      <li>But by the 4th or 5th day, it should get a lot better.  </li>
      <li>Why I am glad I did it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>By the 5th day it will also taste a lot better than the 1st day.  </li>
      <li>Better shaken not blended.</li>
      <li>I have since found a nutrition protein bar with better numbers (GNC)</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>I did not realize that I was becoming diabetic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We are now going into the transition part of the program until we reach our goal weight , will be using this product and other brands to determine what is best for us.  </li>
      <li>Your cravings for sweets should also decrease for a while, making it relatively easy to keep the weight off.  </li>
      <li>I found it quite easy to do</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s good though, is that after you&#x27;re done, your metabolism will be in high-gear and your digestive tract will be clear of all that garbage you put in before, so you will digest food more efficiently.  </li>
      <li>I have done Reset so many times and was only successful once.</li>
      <li>I actually felt really good on the 5th day and wished I had more USANA product so that I could keep the diet going.  </li>
      <li>If you are disciplined you will find this very useful.</li>
      <li>I am at the high end of healthy weight on the BMI, a fairly healthy eater and exercise on a spotty basis.)</li>
      <li>As I said, it isn&#x27;t easy but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Secondly, a 5-day RESET fiber cleanse is most effective if done once per 6 months.  </li>
      <li>RESET works, done right!  </li>
      <li>and I am searching for a more whole food type meal replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The very first shake (vanilla) was so cloyingly sweet</li>
      <li>I enjoyed it, always helps me get back on track of eating healthy and staying away from sugary foods.</li>
      <li>On taste, I thought fine, my husband not so much.  </li>
      <li>I use it to supplement my diet before big athletic events, and I honestly think it helps.</li>
      <li>That being said, you have to stick to the plan for the full five days and do exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years, and love it to reset your body, and get past the sugar withdrawals!! :P</li>
      <li>Ultimately I&#x27;m glad to be rid of those five extra holiday pounds, but I still hesitate to say it was worth it.</li>
      <li>Overall, not disgusting to eat and motivated me to eat right.</li>
      <li>From day 1 I was starving, regardless of how many extra veggie servings I allowed myself.</li>
      <li>First off, I&#x27;d recommend educating yourself on the product before ordering it.  </li>
      <li>The Usana Reset did exactly what it says it will do.</li>
      <li>Plus the vitamins, which are essential to make sure you get all the nutrients you need.  </li>
      <li>We followed it pretty much exactly.  </li>
      <li>While that does not seem to be that much at first glance if you consider that I am 5 ft. 6</li>
      <li>That isn&#x27;t easy especially during the first two days.</li>
      <li>Glad we did it, but probably could have accomplished similar results on our own for less money.  </li>
      <li>Once you do the cleanse, exactly as instructed, your body will be ready to let the fat go.</li>
      <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t do it again.</li>
      <li>Second, several friends of mine lost more than that and had no issues, so clearly the product is fine for some people.</li>
      <li>You have to be really determined to start his Reset.  </li>
      <li>, this may have been more of a salt craving due to the excess water intake.)</li>
      <li>I now see the protein bars and meal replacements as a part of our life when we otherwise cannot eat whole foods (which has always been our main stay)  </li>
      <li>Yes, some of the food tastes bland, but if you combine it with some fruit, it actually can be quite good.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Usana is a high quality product.</li>
      <li>There is a high sugar count.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>give it 2 stars only because USANA honored its first time customer satisfaction guarantee and credited me for the cost of the product (though not for shipping).  </li>
      <li>This product only works for certain people.</li>
      <li>The return process for direct/online retail customers wasn&#x27;t clear on the website, but once I found the Customer Service email address they were timely in their response and in processing my return.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a product that was originally designed for obese and disabled patients.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for a solid kick start to losing some weight.</li>
      <li>I had major headaches and hunger pangs as the Reset broke me of those habits.</li>
      <li>I developed a constant, dull headache early on day 2 that didn&#x27;t go away (even with ibuprofen) until I ate a real meal after the whole thing was over.</li>
      <li>I have never been more exhausted in my life or grouchy.</li>
      <li>When I reviewed the ingredients again I realized it must be the high doses of of niacinamide in both the shake and the vitamin pak, the same stimulant as in Red Bull, which I have a similar reaction to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> So, while you may lose 7-lbs the first 5-days, doing it for 10 days doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re going to lose 14-lbs.  </li>
<li> but when I cheat, I only loose 2 lbs.</li>
<li> I had Vegetable soup for dinner and kept doing the shakes and snakes for the rest and before long the weight started to come off.</li>
<li> Left me very lethargic and weak.</li>
<li> It was pretty tough.  </li>
<li> But worse is that when I did it the last time, I ate extra on day one and daily after that for the entire 5 day Reset.</li>
<li> Yes, the first 3 days are difficult, especially if you&#x27;re used to eating a lot or consuming a lot of sugar.  </li>
<li> Also, I really am not craving sweets and chips as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It was an extreme waste of money and 5 days that I can never get back!</li>
<li> I was used to having a soda at least once per day and my big weakness was chips.</li>
<li> The Strawberry flavor was terrible, but everything else was good.</li>
<li> and I did feel less tired.&lt;br</li>
<li> The only reason I stuck to it was that it was so damned expensive, and since it was technically working (at least the weight-loss part was, I&#x27;m dubious about the other claims)</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why he lost so little.  </li>
<li> And it did little to nothing for my cravings- halfway through</li>
<li> in, tall you get a picture of the little round ball that was me.</li>
<li> I took the vitamin pak and within a few hours my heart was racing</li>
<li> I had tried everything including Nutri-System, South Beach, Atkins, to name a few.</li>
<li> There are other ways to lose weight- slower, maybe, but far less unpleasant.</li>
<li> I spent 5 miserable days following the program - eating only 3 shakes, 2 snack bars, 2 packets of horribly smelling/tasting supplements, 1 serving each of a fresh vegetable and fruit (a couple of days I did eat an additional serving of steamed veggies, as per instructions</li>
<li> - I was terribly hungry), 30 minutes of walking and loads of water daily.</li>
<li> were it not so expensive.</li>
<li> I was desperate, it worked!</li>
<li> I was completely miserable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have done Reset so many times and was only successful once. Everytime I tried it after that I kept eating meals not included in the plan, I get so hungry by the 4th &amp; 5th day. But worse is that when I did it the last time, I ate extra on day one and daily after that for the entire 5 day Reset. I realize that this is not for me anymore. Unless you have the WILLPOWER to follow the program for 5 days, then Good for you. When I only ate fruits and followed the program, I lost 5 lbs in 5 days but when I cheat, I only loose 2 lbs. For the price of Reset, it is just too pricey for me and even that does not keep me successful anymore. I figure if I paid a lot for it, I will do it. Also if you do not follow the Transform and Maintenance Phase, you will gain what you lost during the reset days.</li>
    <li> very pleased. packaged arrived within days of ordering it with no problems at all, and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Left me very lethargic and weak. I followed all directions.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;d recommend educating yourself on the product before ordering it.  It helps if you know a USANA reseller.  Secondly, a 5-day RESET fiber cleanse is most effective if done once per 6 months.  So, while you may lose 7-lbs the first 5-days, doing it for 10 days doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re going to lose 14-lbs.  The weight loss will taper-off.  What&#x27;s good though, is that after you&#x27;re done, your metabolism will be in high-gear and your digestive tract will be clear of all that garbage you put in before, so you will digest food more efficiently.  Your cravings for sweets should also decrease for a while, making it relatively easy to keep the weight off.  I did the RESET 3 months ago, and then I continued losing weight after I stopped.  Yes, the first 3 days are difficult, especially if you&#x27;re used to eating a lot or consuming a lot of sugar.  But by the 4th or 5th day, it should get a lot better.  I actually felt really good on the 5th day and wished I had more USANA product so that I could keep the diet going.  Yes, some of the food tastes bland, but if you combine it with some fruit, it actually can be quite good.  By the 5th day it will also taste a lot better than the 1st day.  Also, I can say that as you continue using USANA and get used to their products, it does become a lot easier to work with.  I use it to supplement my diet before big athletic events, and I honestly think it helps.</li>
    <li> Reviewed ingredients w/ my doctor before trying this; he was on board w/ my trying this out as a kickstart to losing weght.  I ordered from the USANA corporate website.  The very first shake (vanilla) was so cloyingly sweet I couldn&#x27;t take more than 2 sips; I put it away and followed w/ a lot of water.  I had some steamed brocolli when hungry again - could not look at the shake w/o feeling nauseous.  I took the vitamin pak and within a few hours my heart was racing and I felt itchy and sweaty.  When I reviewed the ingredients again I realized it must be the high doses of of niacinamide in both the shake and the vitamin pak, the same stimulant as in Red Bull, which I have a similar reaction to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 2 stars only because USANA honored its first time customer satisfaction guarantee and credited me for the cost of the product (though not for shipping).  The return process for direct/online retail customers wasn&#x27;t clear on the website, but once I found the Customer Service email address they were timely in their response and in processing my return.</li>
    <li> I lost 8 pounds but my intent was to restart my body to eliminate sugar and carbs. I found it quite easy to do and it all tasted great. I highly recommend it. I would do it regularly in my life were it not so expensive.</li>
    <li> RESET is a weight-management program, not just a 5-day cleanse.  You have to finish the RESET and then move to the Transform phase and exercise every day, as the insructions in the box tell you.  Once you do the cleanse, exactly as instructed, your body will be ready to let the fat go. Then, you get to eat two real-food (low-glycemic, not junk) meals/snacks and drink two Nutrimeal shakes a day plus eat one bar, and all the veggies you want.  Plus the vitamins, which are essential to make sure you get all the nutrients you need.  My husband has lost 60 lbs and kept it off for five years and I have lost 24 lbs and kept it off for eight years. RESET works, done right!  Deb Dutcher, Certified Nutrition Consultant and Founder, Energy Unlimited Coach.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I just completed the 5 day reset.  We both are 10-15 pounds over what we feel best at.  I lost 4 and my husband only lost 2.5.  But, his waist (gut) is noticeably smaller .  I don&#x27;t know why he lost so little.  We followed it pretty much exactly.  It was pretty tough.  Last 2 days easier, probably because we knew we were at the end.  Why I am glad I did it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  It taught me to eat ever 2-3 hours to keep the motor running and I did feel less tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2) Also, I really am not craving sweets and chips as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3).  I now see the protein bars and meal replacements as a part of our life when we otherwise cannot eat whole foods (which has always been our main stay)  I have since found a nutrition protein bar with better numbers (GNC) and I am searching for a more whole food type meal replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are now going into the transition part of the program until we reach our goal weight , will be using this product and other brands to determine what is best for us.  Glad we did it, but probably could have accomplished similar results on our own for less money.  On taste, I thought fine, my husband not so much.  Better shaken not blended.</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive. Didn&#x27;t lose any weight during the cleanse but increased exercise and use a shake occasionally as replacement meal when in rushed. It&#x27;s been 4-5 weeks and lost 5 pounds. Overall, not disgusting to eat and motivated me to eat right.</li>
    <li> This was advertised as USANA Reset but when I opened the box it was not USANA product. It was a totally unrelated product by Beach Body.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for a solid kick start to losing some weight. I spent 5 miserable days following the program - eating only 3 shakes, 2 snack bars, 2 packets of horribly smelling/tasting supplements, 1 serving each of a fresh vegetable and fruit (a couple of days I did eat an additional serving of steamed veggies, as per instructions - I was terribly hungry), 30 minutes of walking and loads of water daily. For all of that, I only lost 2 lbs. I have never been more exhausted in my life or grouchy. This was NO way to begin a weight loss journey, and there is no where on USANA&#x27;s website to comment or get feedback from them. It was an extreme waste of money and 5 days that I can never get back! (context note: I am at the high end of healthy weight on the BMI, a fairly healthy eater and exercise on a spotty basis.)</li>
    <li> I am 57 yo male from San Diego. I was weighing 212 lb.. While that does not seem to be that much at first glance if you consider that I am 5 ft. 6 in, tall you get a picture of the little round ball that was me. I had tried everything including Nutri-System, South Beach, Atkins, to name a few. They all worked for a very short time but stopped. I did not realize that I was becoming diabetic. Anyway, I did the 5-day Reset and only lost 6 lb.. But that encouraged me to go further. I had Vegetable soup for dinner and kept doing the shakes and snakes for the rest and before long the weight started to come off. Today I weigh 174 pounds and I don&#x27;t worry about the weight. I still watch what I eat and only have a \\&quot;crazy\\&quot; meal once a week. I keep to what got me out of it. One Vegetable (not cheese or bread) for 6 days a week and my Reset for the rest. I was desperate, it worked! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> You have to be really determined to start his Reset.  The Strawberry flavor was terrible, but everything else was good.</li>
    <li> This product only works for certain people. Its just a cleanser. All it will make you do for 5 days is constant farting and and bathroom visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get &amp;#34;Slenderiix&amp;#34; from Ariix. It&#x27;s a product that was originally designed for obese and disabled patients. The company was even started by the people who created Usana</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and love it to reset your body, and get past the sugar withdrawals!! :P</li>
    <li> Okay. First off, I lost five pounds with this kit, which is great. Second, several friends of mine lost more than that and had no issues, so clearly the product is fine for some people. However, the entire five days I was doing the cleanse I was completely miserable. From day 1 I was starving, regardless of how many extra veggie servings I allowed myself. I developed a constant, dull headache early on day 2 that didn&#x27;t go away (even with ibuprofen) until I ate a real meal after the whole thing was over. I had to stop taking the supplements around day 4 because they were making me dizzy and nauseous. I was constipated, despite drinking almost double the recommended amount of water. My skin broke out. And it did little to nothing for my cravings- halfway through I would have punched somebody in the face for a slice of pizza (though to be fair, this may have been more of a salt craving due to the excess water intake.) The only reason I stuck to it was that it was so damned expensive, and since it was technically working (at least the weight-loss part was, I&#x27;m dubious about the other claims) I figured I may as well power though. Ultimately I&#x27;m glad to be rid of those five extra holiday pounds, but I still hesitate to say it was worth it. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t do it again. There are other ways to lose weight- slower, maybe, but far less unpleasant.</li>
    <li> It works well if you follow it correctly. I enjoyed it, always helps me get back on track of eating healthy and staying away from sugary foods.</li>
    <li> It is a great product if you follow the instructions to a tee. There is a high sugar count. The shakes are extremelly filling and the bars are excellent. Usana is a high quality product.</li>
    <li> The Usana Reset did exactly what it says it will do. I lost about seven pounds and now that I&#x27;m done I haven&#x27;t felt this good in years. That being said, you have to stick to the plan for the full five days and do exactly what it says. That isn&#x27;t easy especially during the first two days. I was used to having a soda at least once per day and my big weakness was chips. I had major headaches and hunger pangs as the Reset broke me of those habits. As I said, it isn&#x27;t easy but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, if you don&#x27;t change your eating habits after the Reset, you will gain back the weight you lost. If you are disciplined you will find this very useful. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Great gluten free products</li>
