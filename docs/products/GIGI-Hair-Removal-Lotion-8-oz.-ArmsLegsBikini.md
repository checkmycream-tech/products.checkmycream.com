      <li>The right leg, perfect, no hair.</li>
      <li>This hair removal is amazing, you leave it on for 10 minutes then wash it off and</li>
      <li>It hurt my skin after I applied it and wasn&#x27;t that effective in removing the hair.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t very strong and</li>
      <li>Of all the hair removal products I have ever tried this has been by far the best.</li>
      <li>This is nothing more than a nice moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair remover I have used.</li>
      <li>I Wanted to Love It!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>of Veet, Gigi, and Nair that I&#x27;ve tried, I like Nair the most.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s an ok product.  </li>
      <li>My skin is usually more irritated with Veet and hair...</li>
      <li>all the hair is gone. :)</li>
      <li>Gets the job done, but they are better hair removal lotions on the market.</li>
      <li>OK, so here come the bumps</li>
      <li>soft, beautiful skin.</li>
      <li>The packaging could be better, but that&#x27;s not really a deal-breaker for me since this stuff is so awesome.  </li>
      <li>I needed something to use on my bikini area because the shave bumps were becoming unbearable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-Cream is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
      <li>it was easy to just place in the areas</li>
      <li>And the smell reminds me of Nair, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as strong.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
      <li>My legs have stayed smooth and stubble free for two days.</li>
      <li>Effective and gentle</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth is made me and</li>
      <li>I have the most sensitive skin to the point where I get abscess very easily.</li>
      <li>I tried this product because of all the great reviews i used it, following the instructions exactly</li>
      <li>Product was good when you repackage it, maybe we will be back.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, my lotion probably drys up quickly.</li>
      <li>The product was very good, it is the bottles that are not good, they break/crack to easily.</li>
      <li>I would give it more stars if it was a huge stand out as compared to others, but just seems to be the same as all the rest.  </li>
      <li>Of course, as with all depilatories, there is that distinct hair removal cream smell.</li>
      <li>, right?  </li>
      <li>I think hot water may cause skin become more sensitive about any hair removal product</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the package as long as the product is good.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable (under $10) and the shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>8-10 minutes works pretty well on my hair, which is maybe medium coarseness.</li>
      <li>I did everything I could to get this product to work, applying it thickly to multiple parts of my body and leaving it on for the maximum allowable safe time according to the bottle (10 minutes).  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this product, I followed the directions on the bottle exactly.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>so this product works for me pretty well.</li>
      <li>I first read reviews on this product from makeupalley.com.</li>
      <li>smell is more obvious than the Nair and Veet</li>
      <li>therefore product is most likely unstable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-It may work better on finer hair such as on your legs, I did not try it there though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My legs have never stayed this smooth, and my hair grows very fast {if I shaved in the morning I would have stubble the next morning}</li>
      <li>It left my skin very soft and did the best job at removing hair (though I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with my experiences yet)</li>
      <li>I left it on my arm for 20 mins and my skin didn&#x27;t feel stingy or burnt, and the hair came off pretty smoothly and thoroughly.</li>
      <li>USED ON THE BIKINI AREA WITH LIMITED SUCCESS, FIRST THE GOOD THING IS IT DID NOT BURN &amp; REMOVED THE LESS DENSE HAIRS.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although, it did ship really fast.</li>
      <li>I applied on it Saturday and 5 days later my skin is still hairfree and smooth...</li>
      <li>Worked really well.</li>
      <li>I just wish the seller could&#x27;ve been more carefully when checked the bottle before shipped it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with hair removal products before -</li>
      <li>Wipe off gently with a damp cloth (rinsing doesn&#x27;t work for me).</li>
      <li>This lotion works better than other one&#x27;s</li>
      <li>This product works better than ANY other.</li>
      <li>It must remain on the full 9 minutes to work completely on my facial hair.</li>
      <li>I ended up waiting the full ten minutes</li>
      <li>There is a slight smell, like most hair removers</li>
      <li>Gigi was the least effective of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>GiGi had no reaction whatsoever with my sensitive skin!  </li>
      <li>This stuff works so good, I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past</li>
      <li>have tried the popular hair removal products similar to this such as Nair, but I wanted an alternative that was less harsh, and also cruelty free.</li>
      <li>So far I have tried Veet, Nair, and this product for hair removal.</li>
      <li>It works very well and you don’t need to leave it on for too long either.</li>
      <li>so I used colder water to wet my arm first.</li>
      <li>I tried it twice on both the bikini area and underarms and both times it left long, very visible stubble.</li>
      <li>This may not apply to everyone, but if you have sensitive skin or actually want to remove hair..</li>
      <li>I could barely use it, I opened the bottle and applied some for the reaction test</li>
      <li>and it barely removed any hair from my legs.</li>
      <li>hair it did remove was difficult to get off my skin as this product makes the hair kind of sticky and</li>
      <li>It has a very high rating and was recommended from members of the community and other MUAs.</li>
      <li>Someone out there probably already invented a permanent hair removal product a long time ago, but they were killed, as all of these companies would not see such huge profits on all of these hair removal let-downs.  </li>
      <li>I usually have to wait around 5 minutes longer than the recommended time, but it doesn&#x27;t burn at all and all of my hair falls right off.</li>

<li> The smell is similar, and it takes slightly longer (7 vs. 5 minutes) but it seems gentler as my skin did not react whereas it would sometimes get little red bumps from using Nair.  </li>
<li> I am blonde and don&#x27;t have thick or coarse hair</li>
<li> /&gt;However, what I couldn&#x27;t get past was the fact that it really didn&#x27;t work for me no matter how then or thick a layer or</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s a little odd that it only works sometimes...</li>
<li> It does have an odor but is not as strong/ offensive as other cream depilatories I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> I thought this product would work from all the other reviews, but after using it I don&#x27;t think I will use it again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t stink as bad as some of the other brands.</li>
    <li> USED ON THE BIKINI AREA WITH LIMITED SUCCESS, FIRST THE GOOD THING IS IT DID NOT BURN &amp; REMOVED THE LESS DENSE HAIRS.  THE BAD IS THAT IT DID NOT REMOVE THE THICK HEAVIER HAIRS.</li>
    <li> I just received this product.  It took weeks to be delivered.  I have not yet used this product, but according to the other reviews I read before purchasing, I believe it will work well.</li>
    <li> So far I have tried Veet, Nair, and this product for hair removal. I&#x27;ve tested all three on my bikini line and underarms. Gigi was the least effective of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It turned my hair almost rubbery and elastic like. I followed all the directions, and left it on for the maximum amount of time instructed. I tried it twice on both the bikini area and underarms and both times it left long, very visible stubble. I could not get it to remove the hair closest to the skin (even though my hair is not thick and was less than 1/4th of an inch long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The hair it did remove was difficult to get off my skin as this product makes the hair kind of sticky and rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is more obvious than the Nair and Veet I&#x27;ve tried. This one smells like rotten eggs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I had no irritation, redness, or burns. Skin was perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cream is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It may work better on finer hair such as on your legs, I did not try it there though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of Veet, Gigi, and Nair that I&#x27;ve tried, I like Nair the most. It left my skin very soft and did the best job at removing hair (though I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with my experiences yet), I&#x27;m thinking of just trying waxing.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product, I followed the directions on the bottle exactly. The right leg, perfect, no hair. But the left? It didn&#x27;t even look like I used it. Very strange. So the next day I tried again and it worked overall. I am still using it but it&#x27;s a little odd that it only works sometimes...</li>
    <li> This hair removal is amazing, you leave it on for 10 minutes then wash it off and all the hair is gone. :)</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, but they are better hair removal lotions on the market.</li>
    <li> 8-10 minutes works pretty well on my hair, which is maybe medium coarseness. I wear latex gloves when applying to keep mess to a minimum. Wipe off gently with a damp cloth (rinsing doesn&#x27;t work for me). It does have an odor but is not as strong/ offensive as other cream depilatories I&#x27;ve tried. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I first read reviews on this product from makeupalley.com. It has a very high rating and was recommended from members of the community and other MUAs. The price was very reasonable (under $10) and the shipping was very fast. I ordered on Wednesday morning and received that Friday. I immediately opened the bottle and used it. I am AA and I have very thick coarse hairs and when I usually use hair removal creams I have to leave the lotion on longer than recommended to get all of my hairs removed, with this, I left it on for 10 minutes or less and all of the hair was gone. The only con about this item is that it stinks horribly. My bathroom reeked of this stuff and I had to wash my hands a few times to get the scent off my fingers. My skin wasn&#x27;t dry and my skin was noticeably smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to repurchase even if the scent is horrid. This stuff works wonders. I will never repurchase Veet or Nair again.</li>
    <li> I applied on it Saturday and 5 days later my skin is still hairfree and smooth...that means i will purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Works great and is as described.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something for a while now that will remove unwanted hair without the painful razor bumps and I have finally found it. This worked great and it&#x27;s so easy. All you have to do is apply and wait. I ended up waiting the full ten minutes then I simply washed it off and it got rid of ALL of my unwanted hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth is made me and it was easy to just place in the areas I wanted it in. There is a slight smell, like most hair removers but it isn&#x27;t very strong and it doesn&#x27;t last once you are done. This is by far the best hair remover I have used.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck with hair removal products before - if I left them on for long enough to remove the hair, my skin would get irritated.  I was hoping my luck would change but unfortunately it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the lotion to my bikini line for the recommended maximum amount of time and followed the directions to a tee.  The result was unsightly (and extremely uncomfortable) stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tossed the bottle in the trash.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I Wanted to Love It!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the popular hair removal products similar to this such as Nair, but I wanted an alternative that was less harsh, and also cruelty free. I hoped this would be what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the smell very, very unpleasant, but looked past it because it was just about as bad as Nair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what I couldn&#x27;t get past was the fact that it really didn&#x27;t work for me no matter how then or thick a layer or how long I left it on it wouldn&#x27;t get all of the hair so I would be left with patches of hair which would then need to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it really irritating to my skin. This may not apply to everyone, but if you have sensitive skin or actually want to remove hair.. AVOID THIS!</li>
    <li> Worked really well. Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I purchased to use on my bikini area only. My skin is usually more irritated with Veet and hair... this stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> This cream worked well on my thighs, but did not work well on my lower legs, even at the maximum time limit. This smells horrible, but not as bad as other brands. It burned while it was on, and made me itchy for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so good, I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past but none work like this one. The bottle well sometimes crack but it&#x27;s usually no big deal because it&#x27;s behind the label like where you squeeze the bottle. I still use it though. Just shake it up like you would before each use.</li>
    <li> Not for me. It hurt my skin after I applied it and wasn&#x27;t that effective in removing the hair.</li>
    <li> I could barely use it, I opened the bottle and applied some for the reaction test and I was gagging all around. The entire room smelled like it and I washed my hands 3 times to try and get the horrible odor off and even after that I still needed some kind of lotion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like any other remover - it smells awful and it works, but just doesn&#x27;t do the job as well as you would like it to do.  I would give it more stars if it was a huge stand out as compared to others, but just seems to be the same as all the rest.  I am blonde and don&#x27;t have thick or coarse hair so that is not an issue - it&#x27;s an ok product.  Razors, epilators, depilatory cream, lasers, electrolysis - when will it end?  Someone out there probably already invented a permanent hair removal product a long time ago, but they were killed, as all of these companies would not see such huge profits on all of these hair removal let-downs.  ;)</li>
    <li> Truly amazing does wonders....smells horrible tho.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of all the great reviews i used it, following the instructions exactly and it barely removed any hair from my legs. This is nothing more than a nice moisturizer. I&#x27;d rather just shave. This stuff is basically pointless.</li>
    <li> This definitely works. I usually have to wait around 5 minutes longer than the recommended time, but it doesn&#x27;t burn at all and all of my hair falls right off.</li>
    <li> It stinks but it works.</li>
    <li> The product was very good, it is the bottles that are not good, they break/crack to easily. The person that turned me onto this said she didn&#x27;t like that about this product as well. Product was good when you repackage it, maybe we will be back.</li>
    <li> Of all the hair removal products I have ever tried this has been by far the best. Effective and gentle and I don&#x27;t mind the smell. I am very happy with this product and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I initially tried this product as an alternative to Nair which tests on animals as, according to PETA&#x27;s website, Gigi does not.  And it was a great switch!  The smell is similar, and it takes slightly longer (7 vs. 5 minutes) but it seems gentler as my skin did not react whereas it would sometimes get little red bumps from using Nair.  I am very happy and will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would work from all the other reviews, but after using it I don&#x27;t think I will use it again. I ended up shaving after I had waited the ten minutes and tried rinincing it off.&lt;br /&gt;Although, it did ship really fast.</li>
    <li> If you have very coarse hair like me, this product will not work. I had a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t, but it work on the finer hair on my body.</li>
    <li> This lotion works better than other one&#x27;s I have tried, but not perfectly.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years now and I use it every once in a while when it falls out of the back of my bathroom shelf, but I&#x27;m overall unimpressed.</li>
    <li> Received the lotion today and tried it immediately on my arm. I think hot water may cause skin become more sensitive about any hair removal product so I used colder water to wet my arm first. The smell of the lotion isn&#x27;t too bad comparing to other lotion I used before. I like that I left it on my arm for 20 mins and my skin didn&#x27;t feel stingy or burnt, and the hair came off pretty smoothly and thoroughly. I rinsed off the lotion and it didn&#x27;t leave any chemical smell on my skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When comes to hair I do believe your race matters. I&#x27;m Asian and my body hair isn&#x27;t too thick so this product works for me pretty well. Cannot speak for other type of body hair. I took one star off because the bottle I received is cracked, even though it&#x27;s sealed with plastic film. I don&#x27;t really care for the package as long as the product is good. I just wish the seller could&#x27;ve been more carefully when checked the bottle before shipped it. I don&#x27;t want to exchange the lotion since I&#x27;m too lazy. Now I just need to find a way to fix this... Otherwise, my lotion probably drys up quickly.</li>
    <li> My legs have never stayed this smooth, and my hair grows very fast {if I shaved in the morning I would have stubble the next morning} My legs have stayed smooth and stubble free for two days. It came in a sealed plastic bag inside a box with no damage to the bottle. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with depilatories in the past, and I was very hesitant to purchase another Nair/Veet product, so I thought I would give this a try. I needed something to use on my bikini area because the shave bumps were becoming unbearable. I got this in the mail about two days after purchasing it online and it works great. No burn, no bumps, no pain. It&#x27;s really a great product. You leave it on for 10 minutes and you can actually see it denaturing the hair. You just wipe away with a damp towel, and voila! soft, beautiful skin. Of course, as with all depilatories, there is that distinct hair removal cream smell. It&#x27;s not really that overbearing, and I will continue to buy this product from now on for my bikini area!</li>
    <li> I did everything I could to get this product to work, applying it thickly to multiple parts of my body and leaving it on for the maximum allowable safe time according to the bottle (10 minutes).  Even after 10 minutes and some scrubbing, only about 20-30% of the hair had been removed.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my calves. But burned my thighs in areas.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It must remain on the full 9 minutes to work completely on my facial hair. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> ATTN MEN!!  This product works better than ANY other. Including Nair,Veet,Specifically made for Men or Generic. Removes hair without irritating/burning your skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product to remove all of my unwanted body hair and it works on everything! I use it on my upper lip, under arms, legs, and bikini area. It works very well and you don’t need to leave it on for too long either. I will definitely be buying this produce again!</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive skin to the point where I get abscess very easily. I wanted something that would allow me to remove all the hair without irritation. This product did it for me. It let me use this product without any irritation. You can used this product WHERE EVER and it will work. I have coarse hair as well and if applied correctly you can get it all in one swipe.</li>
    <li> Product is less harmful yet large amounts are needed for small area. Odor leads believe there&#x27;s a mix of acid and alkaline together therefore product is most likely unstable.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!  I can&#x27;t use products like Nair and Veet because I get \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; and for me, they&#x27;ve never removed hair the way they promise. I used this product, left it on for 8 minutes and the hair was gone!!  OK, so here come the bumps, right?  NOPE!!  GiGi had no reaction whatsoever with my sensitive skin!  The packaging could be better, but that&#x27;s not really a deal-breaker for me since this stuff is so awesome.  And the smell reminds me of Nair, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as strong.  This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I received it n there was a hole on the bottom of the bottle n part of the stuff came out</li>
