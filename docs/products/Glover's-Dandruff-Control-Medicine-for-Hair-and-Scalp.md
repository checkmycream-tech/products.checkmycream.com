### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>One of the absolutely best medicine for your scalp.</li>
      <li>It works best if you leave it in overnight(If</li>
      <li>My favorite!!!</li>
      <li>It is very good, but not the stuff I remember.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was so happy to find Glover products at Amazon</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great for growth.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and have always been satisfied!!.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Granted, it does not smell good, but neither is it intolerable.</li>
      <li>but this oil is good for anyone who&#x27;s having hair loss.</li>
      <li>effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Glover products to anyone with dandruff issues, hair loss or just want to pamper yourself with the effective, gentle and great smelling pine tar soap, hedonism can be a good thing, you deserve it!</li>
      <li>Those are situations you&#x27;ll have to workout on your own if you want to cure  the skin conditions I&#x27;ve described above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it kind of remind me of a BBQ smell of grilled ribs and charcoal.</li>
      <li>acid, Tea Tree, ketaconazole, and the metaderm scalp spray popular on Amazon).</li>
      <li>one thing, for the most effective results in dandruff control rotate your hair care products from sulfa based to pine tar soap, herbal based, and zinc based, this will keep all of these products</li>
      <li>Not as strong as it was years ago!</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S STRONG!</li>
      <li>It works like magic and it not even wanna make you itch your scalp</li>
      <li>add this stuff into my hair regimen and use it more often-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and was quite pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The smell is not too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>is scalp like magic.</li>
      <li>It works really well although the smell is not the most pleasant.  </li>
      <li>The best thing for dry scalp and hair bumps.</li>
      <li>Maybe it was too strong.</li>
      <li>have tried almost every OTC product available on Amazon, and a variety of prescription ones, but had never tried sulfur-based ones before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it was in my head, I felt how soft and felt good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it most of my life, it works and I am surprised this isn&#x27;t sold in stores any more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is no fault of the product, to avoid this, it&#x27;d be a good idea to alternate this medicine with Sal.</li>
      <li>But after that I felt results were only as good as any anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>Now, the fragrance is strong, but like I said \\&quot;this is real medicine\\</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my daughter since she was 4 years old and our hair just seems to keep growing :-)  </li>
      <li>I liked it on initial two three uses.</li>
      <li>a year worth of dandruff</li>
      <li>I bought this product with high hopes, after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Makes hair healthy, thick, and strong :-)</li>
      <li>then it was sold in drug, grocery and feed stores, it was everywhere and very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I kept it in all night and day &amp; used a plastic bag, since I ran out of plastic caps, sectioned my hair into some pretty decebt bantu knots</li>
      <li>it grows back soooo very quickly.  </li>
      <li>during summer the flareups get so intense that I suffer patchy hair loss at rashy areas, and have to shave my head and go gung-ho with a combination of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But to me personally I really really wasn&#x27;t that bothered by it-</li>
      <li>The product, if used consistently, really does the job.</li>
      <li>I washed it out that day for the whole 24hrs</li>
      <li>Very greasy so less is more.</li>
      <li>Now that I am a lot older</li>
      <li>I usually mix it into other products and treat it as a leave product and experience great results.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve tried the other OTC remedies for your dandruff or sebhorreic dermatitis and have had less that good results, or if you want to avoid that frustration, try this product.  </li>
      <li>Really makes me wish I tried this one earlier.</li>
      <li>I see results within 24 hours, but it must be reapplied twice a day for three days in order to completely cure the condition.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would completely remove dandruff, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>My hair has grown in the middle and its still growing thanks to this oil.</li>
      <li>Helps exactly with itchy and dry scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d seriously doubt whether there is a better product that is avaialble without a prescription.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That being said, in years of experimentation, I don&#x27;t remember a single medicine that has so effectively alleviated my symptoms in so little time.</li>
      <li>This product has really helped with my flaky, dry, itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>You have to mix a few drops in with a small jar of Vaseline, because it has a very strong odor</li>
      <li>This is another &#x27;old&#x27; remedy which has been pushed out of the mainstream by big commercial interests.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product for various reason and it still works, for strengthening hair. try it if you have a problem with thinning hair, the smell take some getting use too.</li>
    <li> Glover&#x27;s Dandruff Medicine is what a aspirin is to a headache; it causes dandruff to lessen over time.  This is how I use it, I pretreat my scalp with Glover&#x27;s, let it soak in for about an hour then I shampoo and condition my hair.  Works wonders.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high hopes, after reading so many positive reviews. I didn&#x27;t wanted to use over drying anti dandruff shampoos and thought this could be the solution. But I was wrong. I liked it on initial two three uses. But after that I felt results were only as good as any anti dandruff shampoo. I thought it would completely remove dandruff, but it didn&#x27;t. For me it only provided itch relief for 24 hours. I use it twice a week as directed. Smell is bad too, but It&#x27;s not a bigger problem for me if the product had worked. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and was quite pleased to find it on Amazon.  My previous experience with this product was from 3-4 years ago before I discovered Amazon.

I&#x27;d seriously doubt whether there is a better product that is avaialble without a prescription.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with Seborrheic Dermatitis for 15 years by now, and esp. during summer the flareups get so intense that I suffer patchy hair loss at rashy areas, and have to shave my head and go gung-ho with a combination of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried almost every OTC product available on Amazon, and a variety of prescription ones, but had never tried sulfur-based ones before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product falls under the antifungal class of dermatitis treatments (together with Sal. acid, and less rigorous Zinc), and like ALL antifungal dermatitis treatments (if not ALL treatments), will decrease in effectiveness after a period of use (tolerance issues).&lt;br /&gt;This is no fault of the product, to avoid this, it&#x27;d be a good idea to alternate this medicine with Sal. Acid and/or Coal Tar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, in years of experimentation, I don&#x27;t remember a single medicine that has so effectively alleviated my symptoms in so little time. (To give you an idea, in the last 2 months I&#x27;ve been using coal tar, sal. acid, Tea Tree, ketaconazole, and the metaderm scalp spray popular on Amazon). While all the other treatments do work in varying degrees this product literally KILLED a hair-loss-grade outburst in just 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it does not smell good, but neither is it intolerable. And at such a price too. Really makes me wish I tried this one earlier.</li>
    <li> My Grandpa had hair loss and dandruff, he had a blacksmith shop spending hours at a open, coke fired forge hot nasty combustion by products and stratified iron. We always used Glover&#x27;s pine tar bar soap one day Grandma handed him a bottle of Glover&#x27;s Dandruff Control Medicine, \\&quot;try this Bill\\&quot;, definitely not soothing to ones olfactory senses but in a week we all noticed no flakes and hair fuzzing up on his bald spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back then it was sold in drug, grocery and feed stores, it was everywhere and very reasonable. As time passed Glover products have become obscure and difficult to find, often at outrageous prices considering how reasonable they were in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find Glover products at Amazon I jumped on the opportunity and should receive it an a couple of days, can&#x27;t wait....one thing, for the most effective results in dandruff control rotate your hair care products from sulfa based to pine tar soap, herbal based, and zinc based, this will keep all of these products effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Glover products to anyone with dandruff issues, hair loss or just want to pamper yourself with the effective, gentle and great smelling pine tar soap, hedonism can be a good thing, you deserve it!</li>
    <li> I have always had very thin hair in the middle of my scalp. My friend was fixing my hair one day and put some of this oil in my hair and my life has not been the same since. My hair has grown in the middle and its still growing thanks to this oil. I have never been someone to convince someone of anything but this oil is good for anyone who&#x27;s having hair loss. I am a living witness, I will give the product of a rating of 10 plus...</li>
    <li> I have not started using yet but I am familiar with the Glover&#x27;s product and I won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> In my younger years I have used this product a lot. Now that I am a lot older it does not seem to have the same affect.</li>
    <li> my 80 y.o. mother had been in the hospital, dehydrated.  her scalp was so dry...the glovers product gave her relief and an even scalp</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who had very bad dandruff stuck to his scalp that was leaving sore after using it for a week it did nothing to heal it it actually MADE IT worse. S I went to my local beauty store and got the Glovers from their in the white bottle it worked almost instantly the next morning a year worth of dandruff just came off is scalp like magic. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS BUY THE ONE IN WHITE BOTTLE</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have always been satisfied!!.  The order came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> The Glover&#x27;s Dandruff Control Medicine didn&#x27;t work for me! Maybe it was too strong. I am not sure why it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My husband uses Glover&#x27;s product to regrow hair on his head.  The product, if used consistently, really does the job.</li>
    <li> Helps exactly with itchy and dry scalp. The way I did it was by clarifying my hair with apple cider vinegar, then washed it out. Later, I sectioned my hair and used the Glover&#x27;s. I kept it in all night and day &amp; used a plastic bag, since I ran out of plastic caps, sectioned my hair into some pretty decebt bantu knots ans wrapped the two plastic bags around them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I washed it out that day for the whole 24hrs it was in my head, I felt how soft and felt good. I would say this about the smell of it- IT&#x27;S STRONG! But to me personally I really really wasn&#x27;t that bothered by it- it kind of remind me of a BBQ smell of grilled ribs and charcoal. I actually like the smell- not love it- but it was tolerable. So after you washed it out the smell will still be present there- so just use a a conditioner to wash a bit of the smell out. The smell will still be there but it isn&#x27;t going to be as crucial of a smell as it would be when you were putting it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will add this stuff into my hair regimen and use it more often- I will also give updates over this product on my channel ( [...] )</li>
    <li> It is very good, but not the stuff I remember.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as it was years ago!</li>
    <li> This is another &#x27;old&#x27; remedy which has been pushed out of the mainstream by big commercial interests. This product actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron&lt;br /&gt;The Apocalypse Theorem&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> My favorite!!! I&#x27;ve been using this for years and every time I cut my hair it grows back soooo very quickly.  I mix it with vaseline and apply at least once a week or every other week onto the scalp.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my daughter since she was 4 years old and our hair just seems to keep growing :-)  It stinks but it works!  Makes hair healthy, thick, and strong :-)</li>
    <li> This is \\&quot;real\\&quot; medicine for painful, red, itchy scalp, forehead and eye brows.  I see results within 24 hours, but it must be reapplied twice a day for three days in order to completely cure the condition.  Now, the fragrance is strong, but like I said \\&quot;this is real medicine\\&quot; so don&#x27;t be applying it before the prom date and it may even disturb your partners sensibilities at bedtime.  Those are situations you&#x27;ll have to workout on your own if you want to cure  the skin conditions I&#x27;ve described above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drugstore dot com discontinued selling this and Walgreens only sells it \\&quot;in-store\\&quot;, not online, so I purchase it now through Amazon.</li>
    <li> One of the absolutely best medicine for your scalp. It will regrow, strengthen, and take care of itchy dandruff.  I&#x27;ve used it most of my life, it works and I am surprised this isn&#x27;t sold in stores any more. Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product has really helped with my flaky, dry, itchy scalp. I do use it once or twice every week depending on if my scalp is itching really bad. The smell of the product is something you will have to get use to but other then that it does what it says.</li>
    <li> stinks!&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t get it out of my hair, had to wash my hair 2-3 times a day for almost a week to get it all out.. did nothing for my flaky scalp</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. It get rid of dandruff. I never really had a problem with dandruff, but I recently noticed it. So I bought this and then it was gone. The smell will make you rethink putting it on your head or even after you apply you may think you&#x27;ve made  a mistake lol. It works best if you leave it in overnight(If you can stand the smell). Very greasy so less is more.</li>
    <li> I remember this growing up as a kid, my mom would use it in my hair, when there was a notice sent out at school of head lice or when I played in sand/dirt. (I have always had long hair.)  You have to mix a few drops in with a small jar of Vaseline, because it has a very strong odor and I would only put it on during the weekend, when I plan on staying around the house.  Now remember that you must dilute it with Vaseline or it could irritate your scalp!</li>
    <li> I used this product 30+ years ago.  It still works!  The smell is not too overwhelming.</li>
    <li> The best thing for dry scalp and hair bumps. It works like magic and it not even wanna make you itch your scalp and it&#x27;s great for growth. I have been using this as a child. The smell is manageable but it works please try it out.</li>
    <li> Warning: I do not use this product as directed.  I usually mix it into other products and treat it as a leave product and experience great results.</li>
