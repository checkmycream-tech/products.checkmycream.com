<li> So far, the black paint hasn&#x27;t chipped either which is a plus.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very pleased, I ordered it on January 19th or 20th and got it yesterday in the mail (aside for the terrible snow storm, it was decent timing).</li>
<li> so it took way to long</li>
<li> They seem to hold tight and look just like the ones my local hair supply store is selling for $1 for each clip.</li>
<li> i was hoping they would be a little bigger</li>
<li> it was ok because she didn&#x27;t say nothing bad about them.</li>
<li> Expected Date was May 18th through June 4th.</li>
<li> clips were there with a few extra.</li>
<li> They are just as described and they work as expected.</li>
<li> They are not too big, but they are also not too small.</li>
<li> Not too big, not too small.</li>
<li> I sometimes wonder about customer comments as it seems as some of the negative comments that sometimes arise are from a totally different product than the one I received.</li>
<li> If you have a sensitive scalp it might be irritating.</li>
<li> Yes it takes a little longer to get them</li>
<li> They get a little use to wearing tho.</li>
<li> 3 star because they are heavy in your head.</li>
<li> I received 50 and paid less than $4.00!</li>
<li> A few were broken very hard to snap open</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t sew these on  because the holes on the end were to small.</li>

    <li> God! I love it!! 50 pieces and all!! Couldn&#x27;t be a happier girl!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these clips. I made myself some clip in extensions and buying these at the beauty supply store is a RIP OFF. I am completely happy with these. I got all 50 clips on time and they are top quality. I will never pay $2 for 2 clips again.</li>
    <li> A few were broken very hard to snap open</li>
    <li> The Clips look great. I counted and I received all of them. I Haven&#x27;t used them yet. The order came very fast I Ordered on April 22nd &amp; received them on May 13th. Expected Date was May 18th through June 4th.</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount of product you get.</li>
    <li> I like making my own clip in hair extensions,  I can change my hair length, color or style on a whim, without damaging my nature hair,or subjecting myself to a time consuming procsss.</li>
    <li> nice quality. all 50pcs were accounted for. Shipping was estimated at 15 days or more but the package arrived faster than expected.</li>
    <li> speedy shipping, and item is as described. For a woman that has been struggling with alternatives for hair salon visits this was surely a steal!</li>
    <li> Wow it took a long time to get, but the price is absolutely unbeatable. Looking forward to attaching them to my hair extensions.  I bought real hair extensions that had no clips because it saves so much $$ to do this way. Definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I used these to make my own clip in and they are amazing.</li>
    <li> For the price they are awesome to do what needs to be done</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t sew these on  because the holes on the end were to small.</li>
    <li> Always a great reliable product</li>
    <li> These clips really does come in handy for a quick fix for extensions. better than spending a fortune at a salon.</li>
    <li> Love love love and the price is awesome for the amount</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, I ordered it on January 19th or 20th and got it yesterday in the mail (aside for the terrible snow storm, it was decent timing). BUT, #1. The clips I got weren&#x27;t the clips shown (the were black, but they weren&#x27;t round, U-Shaped, which didn&#x27;t bother me much because I like the basic straight clips and that&#x27;s what I got). #2. I only received 20, not 50. I noticed someone else said in the Reviews a while back that they weren&#x27;t doing 50 anymore so I sort of had a forewarning, and if that&#x27;s the case, at least change the information for the product so no one is misled. Aside from that, great product, reasonable timing, I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> Did not come with 50 pieces. Came with 6.</li>
    <li> Work well and easy to put on the track :-)</li>
    <li> This was great! It arrived in a little less than three weeks and they have a super strong hold! it came with exactly 50 clips and so far, I haven&#x27;t found any that were broken, so it was definitely worth the price and wait</li>
    <li> 3 star because they are heavy in your head.</li>
    <li> I have course, African-American hair and these clasps do a  great job. So far, the black paint hasn&#x27;t chipped either which is a plus. Great product. Great deal.</li>
    <li> i was hoping they would be a little bigger but i guess i liked them.</li>
    <li> Order came faster then estimated apparently it ships from china so I think they must estimate at longer period. I place my order on 5/30/13 and received on 6/7/13 . My clips came in a cute blue baggy which I thought was an added bonus since I will be able to reuse it. All50 clips were there with a few extra. Diffinately would order again and recommend</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Way better then the ones you get at sallys</li>
    <li> Love them/ very easy to use/ gently on the scalp!!/ will buy if needed again</li>
