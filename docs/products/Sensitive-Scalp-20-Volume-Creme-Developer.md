      <li>For some months now, I have been using box dyes to achieve a medium brown to light brown  ends in an ombre style with balayage highlights.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive fair skin</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>

      <li>also like the pleasant smell of the developer (especially since the dye itself brought tears to my eyes).</li>
      <li>To do this, I lifted my hair with L&#x27;oreal Superior Preference Ash Blonde and then used the Revlon Frost n Glow honey highlights to have lighter ends and highlights.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, light pleasant scent &amp; does not run after mixed with hair color and applied.</li>
      <li>Does not have a strong odor and was gentle on my scalp and hair.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel soft and healthy after using bleach and dye products.</li>
      <li>Luckily the area that had the most damage was in the back of my head.</li>
      <li>The whole mixture will turn bright pink but DON&#x27;T WORRY your hair won&#x27;t be dyed</li>
      <li>Not only did my scalp NOT BURN, but there was no peeling, and my hair turned out better than ever.</li>

      <li>I lifted my hair another level but the overall effect is more even.</li>
      <li>Good for softening harsh grays for coloring.</li>
      <li>Not too long because I already had dye on most of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It made my hair very brittle and when I went to wash it, clumps of hair broke off to the area I first applied it.</li>
      <li>I loved this look however after awhile the summer sun would inevitably bring out the red tones in the medium brown and the brassiness in the highlights, plus the color would fade incredibly fast, much faster than the promised 8 weeks.</li>
      <li>20% developer, doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp too much.  </li>
      <li>I had to work really fast to get it on my hair</li>
      <li>Really does lessen the irritation my scap feels when I bleach my roots.</li>

      <li>The sensitive scalp formula worked just as promised.</li>
      <li>Solved severe sensitive scalp problems in having my hair colored.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived in good time. Smells very nice and works perfectly with the Wella toners.</li>
    <li> Great smell, and very gentle on my scalp.</li>
    <li> This product is the best of the best in my book. It never dries out hair, never breaks it. It smells great and covers really well. I love this product and recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for years. Very gentle, light pleasant scent &amp; does not run after mixed with hair color and applied. I highly recomend this product. I will continue to use this product as my only hair color developer.</li>

    <li> This is my go to developer.  Works great, big huge bottle at a great price.  20% developer, doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp too much.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> I frequently dye my hair and this product doesn&#x27;t burn and it does leave my scalp itchy for a day or two afterwards.  It&#x27;s very gentle and works great.</li>
    <li> this is a great developer. smells yummy and fruity out of the bottle.  i have a gentle scalp and bleach my 1/8 inch long dark brown hair once a week to blonde with this and the ion on scalp powder bleach.  45min and i&#x27;m down to pale yellow with zero scalp irritation. add on 25 min of toner with this developer and i&#x27;m a pale almost platinum blonde, yay! no burning, no tingling, no nothing. this is the only developer i will be using.</li>
    <li> This has a nice smell. It was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Solved severe sensitive scalp problems in having my hair colored. Without it, I would have had to stop coloring my hair. Been using it for 5 or 6 years.</li>
    <li> Bought this developer to use with Wella color to tone my hair.  Does not have a strong odor and was gentle on my scalp and hair.  Worked great on the brassiness of my hair.  Use it every 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely must have for people who dye their hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;I mix this with bleach, toner and hair dye. Next time, I&#x27;d try 30vol as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once - the color is beautiful and my scalp feels great! No problems at all and I would definitely recommend this produce.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly.  I would buy this again, it caused no irritation to my scalp at all. Ion is quickly becoming my go to brand.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft and healthy after using bleach and dye products.</li>
    <li> Good for softening harsh grays for coloring.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because I have extremely dry, irritable scalp and it did not cause any burning or tingling sensation at all. I had went through the process of lifting the color of my hair with bleach using another developer and it severely burned my scalp. That is why I bought this to tone my hair with. I wanted something more mild but still effective. It did not have a bad chemical smell. I used this with a toner and left it on for about 15 minutes. It worked well in conjunction with the toner. No irritated scalp or anything. It felt almost like I had a conditioner in my hair.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff works great and smells good too! I used to use Salon Care 40 and this stuff works way better than it! MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> I used this product due that i have sensitive scalp and it worked great. No itching or burning on my scalp. I truly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t burn at all.  I bought it with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Bleach to bleach my hair to white.  It smells wonderful, even when mixed with the bleach.  During application I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling or burning - not even while I let it process.  When I washed it out it left my hair feeling oddly conditioned.  Would definitely buy again but this time for touch-ups I might opt for 30 volume because of how dastardly Asian black my hair is.</li>
    <li> Really does lessen the irritation my scap feels when I bleach my roots.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like this stuff... the color washed out of my hair almost immediately.</li>
    <li> AWSOME Developer worked good  on my scalp mixed with Wella t18 :) toner :)</li>

    <li> My scalp was always red for a day or two -- not with this product.  No burning or tingling as it&#x27;s processing, and the effect is the same.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It didn&#x27;t burn my scalp like other developers.</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is black. For some months now, I have been using box dyes to achieve a medium brown to light brown  ends in an ombre style with balayage highlights. To do this, I lifted my hair with L&#x27;oreal Superior Preference Ash Blonde and then used the Revlon Frost n Glow honey highlights to have lighter ends and highlights. I loved this look however after awhile the summer sun would inevitably bring out the red tones in the medium brown and the brassiness in the highlights, plus the color would fade incredibly fast, much faster than the promised 8 weeks. Also, I did not like how the L&#x27;oreal Superior Preference would turn black about 15 minutes after being mixed. I had to work really fast to get it on my hair or else the ends would be dyed black. It even says in the instructions that if you put it on hair that&#x27;s already been dyed this same color, that hair might turn black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to go a step up in the DIY ladder and go to Sally&#x27;s to mix the dyes myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I wanted to stay in the ash blonde family of color – not to achieve an ash blonde result, but to lighten my black hair to a nice light-medium brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed equal parts (1:1) of the Ion 12.1 Hi-lift ash blonde (the whole 2.5 oz package) and Ion sensitive scalp 20 volume developer and added 2 packets of the Ardell red/gold corrector to ensure against any sort of brassiness. The whole mixture will turn bright pink but DON&#x27;T WORRY your hair won&#x27;t be dyed pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the section of hair closest to my neck first because it had quite a bit of black on it, then slowly moved layer by layer until I reached the top, from roots to ends. I really saturated my hair and still had quite a bit of product left over. I put it all under plastic around my head and left it on for 35 minutes. Not too long because I already had dye on most of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also dyeing my eyebrows at the same time so I was very concerned at my skin getting irritated. The sensitive scalp formula worked just as promised. My scalp, the skin around my eyes and around my hairline, and my neck were all fine – no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result was fantastic! I lifted my hair another level but the overall effect is more even. I still have my highlights but they are no longer brassy. The reddish tints of my brown hair are gone. The color is softened and shiny and beautiful. My hair did not dry out at all . I am really hoping this color will remain like this for the rest of the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the pleasant smell of the developer (especially since the dye itself brought tears to my eyes).ve scalp formula worked just as promised.

    <li> I bought this because it was highly recommended to use for my at home bleaching and it works great!  Platinum blonde in 35 minutes!  No burning scalp!</li>
    <li> Only developer brand i use to bleach my roots to match my platinum roots</li>
    <li> Love this. Very gentle on my scalp and perfect if you want to take a step up from box dye or you tone your own hair.</li>
    <li> I loved this and it worked perfectly the first two times I used it. I mixed it with Quick Blue by Loreal.  You mix equal parts of quick blue and developer and then add a few drops of Ardell Hair Color Corrector to help with brassy tones when taking your hair from dark to blonde. The only reason I put four stars was because the last time I used it, I left it in for the maximum amount of time. This was a mistake. It made my hair very brittle and when I went to wash it, clumps of hair broke off to the area I first applied it. Perhaps it was because my hair is VERY thick and I did not start the timer until I had completely covered my roots. Luckily the area that had the most damage was in the back of my head. I shall have to wear a pony tail for a while until my hair grows out.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive fair skin and this did not bother me one bit. I will continue to buy this item. I also bought the 30 Volume for bleaching and again had no issues.</li>
    <li> Great for on scalp use. I had no irritation or issues and I have very sensitive skin</li>
