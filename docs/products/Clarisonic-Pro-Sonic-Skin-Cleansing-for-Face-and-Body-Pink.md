      <li>My skin feels and looks amazing...</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend much, the MIA is probably the best.</li>
      <li>and i truly feel as if it is cleaning my skin effectively, and removing all of the oil and the dirt.</li>
      <li>My complexion was kind of \\&quot;ruddy\\&quot; before</li>
      <li>Once I stopped using them and used my own products, I stopped breaking out.</li>
      <li>This is a great brush like the reviews say on Amazon and the official Clarisonic site but much cheaper threw here, which is the biggest plus in my book along with the great performance of the product.</li>
      <li>Your face feels so clean and looks great.</li>
      <li>Also the three year warranty restarted on my new unit, which is wonderful!</li>
      <li>I honestly did not expect such great results!  </li>
      <li>So I ordered this product via a Groupon special and loved it...for three weeks.</li>
      <li>My skin products absorb much better when I use it.  </li>
      <li>I think it must help your skin renew itself faster because my face always has that healthy glow to it now.</li>
      <li>Ok-</li>
      <li>I use top of the line skin products, but NOTHING made the difference that this Clarisonic has.</li>
      <li>I really like how great my skin feels after I wash with it.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>She is very happy to have it, she uses it frequently, and I think her skin looks fantastic since she&#x27;s started using it.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more radiant.</li>
      <li>I want to tell you something more about the version.</li>
      <li>Already I want to purhase the basic model for my best friend&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s birthday.</li>
      <li>hope this review and update helps.  :-)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>even my makeup goes on and looks better...</li>
      <li>I tried it and was amazed by how smooth my middle-aged skin was!</li>
      <li>but now it is more even.  </li>
      <li>I was amazed at how much more makeup came off with the brush...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d also recommend Philosophy&#x27;s facial cleanser - works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>and I have noticed my skin absorbes face lotion much better and it looks clearer and smoother.  </li>
      <li>AFTER MANY TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS, I NOW USE IT 2</li>
      <li>I have had my clarisonic since before Valentine&#x27;s day and just love it.  </li>
      <li>I hope others have better results that I got.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels and looks FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>I know the biggest advantage of the Clarisonic is its cleansing power which allows your skin to absorb product better.</li>
      <li>I feel so much better after using this -</li>
      <li>I love my Clarisonic Pro Sonic...</li>
      <li>You will love it, too.</li>
      <li>and my skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>:) love</li>
      <li>so far so good!</li>
      <li>This item is pretty good at cleaning and smoothing out your skin.</li>
      <li>I have always had pretty good skin, and am not used to these break outs and stubborn spots.</li>
      <li>It is effective and you will get the result so quickly.</li>
      <li>At the end, after finding the pro version, that is the most advanced, on Amazon for just 60 $ more than the Mia, I decided go for this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far I have used the clarisonic with my Clinique face wash and as I said it works great.</li>
      <li>the most important thing though is if your skin is ACNE PRONE as mine</li>
      <li>The brushes are easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>It has four speeds which are easily changeable as you cleanse your face or body.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about spending the money for this product but my skin has never looked better!  It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> My estetician sold me one I was thinking maybe she got a commission on it if I bought it but it really works. I dont break out barely at all! My daughter used it for a couple weeks when she was visiting and begged me for one so I bought this for her.. She loves it too. says her back is much better now too. I guess the key is exfoliation!</li>
    <li> Soo Lux! amazing product! especially the body brush, your decollete just shines and shimmers youthfully in the light. Some other reviews say that this product broke them out then they \\&quot;immediately returned it\\&quot; TOO BAD. WELL what lots of people do not know is that there are impurities embedded deep down and when actually cleaning your face for real for the first time with this it is going to bring all that deep down dirt and oil up to the surface of the skin causing break outs to the surface, but thats ok because the skin is \\&quot;breaking out\\&quot; getting rid of the impurities, eventually u will have clean skin unlike you actually did before. :) love it get it! u know you want it!</li>
    <li> I love my new Clarisonic Pro!  I could see a difference in my skin after the very first use.  My skin is definitely cleaner and softer.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush like the reviews say on Amazon and the official Clarisonic site but much cheaper threw here, which is the biggest plus in my book along with the great performance of the product. This model is also a big hit with me for the PINK Breast Cancer Awareness foundation, My skin is so smooth like newborn skin instantly after the first use and I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term use effects with my new Clarisonic Pro Sonic Skin Cleansing body and face.</li>
    <li> Thanks to other reviews, I took the plunge and spent the money to get the Clarisonic pro. Several reviews were like me, around 40, long-term skin struggles (dry, uneven, blotchy, some acne even at 40!). I&#x27;ve tried many products and my skin was manageable but dull and in need of makeup coverage. I have only used the pro for a little over a week but already notice an improvement in my skin...it&#x27;s more radiant. (I did experience mild \\&quot;purging\\&quot; like others mentioned but for me it was around day 4 and 5 and that seems to have cleared up already). I just tried lighter translucent makeup because I&#x27;m tired of the heavy feel of more full coverage makeup and I hat having to constantly touch up...so far so good! My skin is not perfect but improved enough to feel more confident even with less makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a couple years now, but what pushed me to action was how stressed my skin  has been lately and not being able to find a solution. I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have been struggling with blackheads, break outs and cystic pimples for the last year. I have always had pretty good skin, and am not used to these break outs and stubborn spots. I have only been using it for a little over a week, but am so amazed at the how clean my pores are becoming and stubborn black heads and cystic spots that have been cleansed, with all the yuck removed and finally going away. I got the PRO model for the Body attachment, and have been pleased with everything thus far.</li>
    <li> After trying a few other cleansers, I finally talked myself into buying the Clarisonic. I love it. It works great, the battery life is more than amazing. I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the Clarisonic cleansing products as I feel they made me brake out. Once I stopped using them and used my own products, I stopped breaking out. I&#x27;m getting ready to purchase the \\&quot;deep cleaning\\&quot; brush now. I am very pleased with it and I even purchased one for my husband.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser as I was impressed with the improvement, it&#x27;s cousin, the Sonic tooth brush made with my teeth and gums.  It makes my face feel good and glow from doing the job a wash cloth can not manage.</li>
    <li> I got this product for mother&#x27;s day. And the difference on me and my wife&#x27;s skin is amazing. It is effective and you will get the result so quickly.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product. It took me a while to decide if going for clarisonic or a cheaper brand, if choosing the cheaper clarisonic (the MIA) or the most expensive. At the end, after finding the pro version, that is the most advanced, on Amazon for just 60 $ more than the Mia, I decided go for this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really worth! My skin has change in a week, using it! Smooth, clear, better texture, tighter pores...my housemate was the first nothing the difference and she didn&#x27;t know that I was using it. I want to tell you something more about the version. I can&#x27;t feel very much difference about speed 1, 2 or 3. What makes the difference to me is the pro speed! I can really feel pulsate my skin. I use it every 2/3 days, as extra treatment. Regarding the body, is not easy to reach the back. Probably I&#x27;ll buy the extension, with time. It works well on legs and in general to exfoliate, but not sure it does more than an exfoliating brush. In summary, I thing the brush/sonic technology for face is great. If you don&#x27;t want to spend much, the MIA is probably the best. If you want something more, go for the PRO, since is the one that offers you the 4th extra speed.</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old with combination skin.. dry on my cheeks, oily on my chin and Tzone with black heads  surrounding my nose. I finally took the \\&quot;plunge\\&quot; and purchased this with much pressure from my best friend who&#x27;s had one for a couple of years now. We both have polar opposite skin types, but I thought what the hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival, the packaging was just as it should be. Everything appeared to be unscathed and brand new. After reading several reviews, I took the advice and continued to use my normal cleanser instead of the products Clarisonic provided. (I use Aveeno sensitive skin cleanser)I have very sensitive skin and was concerned that I might have a massive reaction. The first 4-5 days I had it, I used it twice daily (it&#x27;s too much for my sensitive skin) But instantly I could feel the difference in my skin tone and smoothness. SUPER IMPORTANT! If you have sensitive skin at all, I would STRONGLY suggest using a very heavy moisturizer if you&#x27;re like me and use it at night. Due to the awesome exfoliating this product gives you, you will need a really good moisturizer or you will feel like your skin is very dry. I use Olay moisturizers and Aquaphor on my super dry areas (cheeks and forehead)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the clarisonic now for just over a month and am incredibly impressed. Every once in a while I forget to use it...or I&#x27;m just tired and head off to bed without using it. The once-a-day routine has worked very well for me and after a couple of weeks, I too went through the \\&quot;purge\\&quot; thing that everyone else talks about, but it was small pimples in my chin area and they cleared up within a couple days.. no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an extremely satisfied customer and have no complaints whatsoever! Thank you Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> After much debate between this product and the far less expensive Olay product, I chose the Clarisonic Pro.  The primary reason for my decision was based on input from my esthetician.  She has used both and much prefers the Clarisonic for it&#x27;s quality, effectiveness, and the ability to use on the body (in the Pro model).    I am 42 years old and my skin was combination, oily in the T-zone, dry everywhere else, prone to blakheads in the T-zone - some of which I have had for years and have not been able to get rid of, and a little dull looking.  I have been using the Clarisonic Pro with the sensitive brush head on my face religiously, 1x every other day, for about a month.  I wash my face first with Cetaphil cleanser, and then add a little more Cetaphil to the brush head and use the 4 zone setting.  After the first use of the Clarisonic I was amazed at how much more makeup came off with the brush... I thought my face was clean before I started.  After 3 or 4 uses I could tell a noticeable difference in how my skin felt - very soft &amp; supple.  In the last week, I have started to get compliments on my \\&quot;spa-like glow\\&quot;.  The blackheads are gone.  Best of all?  I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation anymore!  I use a little concealer around my eyes and that&#x27;s it.    I did go through a \\&quot;purging\\&quot; phase after about a week where I got a couple pimples in places I don&#x27;t normally break out.  They went away quickly though.    I would recommend this product to women of my age group especially.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clarrsonic system a little over a month ago.  I was hesitant with some of the reviews.  I followed the instructions included and charged for 24hrs before use.  I have had no problems.  I do not place it in the charger until it beeps indicating low charge.  I can go well over 3 weeks on one charge and I use this daily.  I do keep it in the shower on a higher caddy shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a definate difference in my skin.  Quickly my skin was smoother, cleaner and brighter.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The reason why this is only 4 stars and not 5 was becauase the product arrived almost as described, largely very new except that the instruction manual was torn.  I did not mind because the device and all the brushes looked brand new. I&#x27;m glad I took the plunge because I was previously very worried and almost tried to cancel my order because of a couple of negative reviews I read about this seller (brushes and device looked used and were not new as described) but luckily my fears were unfounded.    Now on the product itself - like another reviewer had said, if you had used an electronic toothbrush before you would know the difference between manual brushing and electronic brushing. It is the same for the clarisonic. You may think you have cleaned your face really well, but washing with the clarisonic will always be cleaner. I have oily skin with acne, and now I can see that the areas around the nose and cheek look somewhat clearer (after 3 days of use).  However, I&#x27;m also experiencing the slight \\&quot;purging\\&quot; so many users have mentioned on the right cheek, and so now I&#x27;m avoiding that area to prevent spreading of bacteria. That said, I think it really works well to clean and tone skin. Will update again on whether skin improves or deteriorates in a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> i have used one for 5 years. it cleans my pores better than cleanser alone, as evidenced by the make-up left on the brush after using. I am happy to recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product had arrived at time.&lt;br /&gt;The box was openned, but all the parts were inside.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing to have at home for each women, my wife is very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got large pores, a oily t-zone, and some blemishes.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks now and I see no difference in my skin.  I did not use the cleanser included in the kit, instead I&#x27;ve been using what I&#x27;ve always used.  I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle, I expected some difference, and at this point I don&#x27;t see any.  My brush is heading back to Amazon. I will say it removes makeup like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before.  I hope others have better results that I got.</li>
    <li> What did I do before clarisonic!?? I had no idea something like this existed....so happy I got it and I use it all the time. Cleanses so well, I only use a non comedogenic type facial cleanser with it</li>
    <li> I had a bunch of gift cards so I decided to take the plunge and get a Clarisonic.  I read the reviews and did my research becausse it was such a high priced item, and I honestly did not think it would work.  Well, I was extremely surprised with the results after using it for the first time.  I have acne ridden skin with the scarring to go along.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a cure for my adult acne but something to decrease my breakouts and keep my skin clean.  The first time I used it my face was so much smoother.  It felt \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; too because it was so clean.  I used the deep pore cleansing brush with the sensitive skin cleanser and it worked wonders.  My complexion was kind of \\&quot;ruddy\\&quot; before but now it is more even.  I have used it for only a week and I cannot stop raving about it to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> The item is great. I love it in pink. I bought the Pro but now that I have it and use it everyday, I think the Mia would have suited my needs just as well. I love it so much I am purchasing a Mia for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Purchased this cleaner for my birthday, probably needs a couple of weeks to see dramatic changes. The set of facial cleaners smells really good though. Anyways, good anticipations.</li>
    <li> I watched a couple of reviews of the Clarisonic products on television including a \\&quot;try it before you buy it\\&quot;.  All were positive so I decided to give it a try.  I am so happy with how well this works.  My skin feels incredible and just knowing how clean I am getting it is wonderful.  It has a one minute timer and beeps &amp; briefly pauses so you change locations every 15 seconds.  It is waterproof so you can use it in the shower. Can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough.  Money well spent.</li>
    <li> Ok- As most of you are/were, I was quite skeptical of this product. For $20, I would not be as skeptical, but for almost $200- it better be darn good! Really, all it is is a super fast scrubby thing for your face. I think it must help your skin renew itself faster because my face always has that healthy glow to it now. After the first use, your face will be super smooth. With daily use, your face just continues to be healthy, clean, and \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a good change in my complexion since using the Clarisonic. Not a magical change though. My acne has cleared up considerably but my T-zone still could look better.  Clarisonic is not a cure all, but I don&#x27;t regret spending the money to get it.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try different product and see if that doesn&#x27;t help. I know the biggest advantage of the Clarisonic is its cleansing power which allows your skin to absorb product better. Perhaps a product change of which my skin needs will improve my complexion more and I will have a positive review update!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year later (almost).........I still like it, not love it.  I still have acne break outs but not nearly as consistent. My t-zone looks better and my overall complexion looks better. I think the biggest factor is the product used with the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I give the Clarisonic 8 out of 10, still definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;My final thought is this: as long as you have the proper product for your skincare needs then the Clarisonic will help facilitate a good response from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review and update helps.  :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic Pro for 3 years now and I do use it EVERY SINGLE DAY! It has never failed me yet. It does keep my pores clean. The charge is still excellent after constant daily use. I only have to charge it perhaps every 10 days or so. I usually wait for it to go completely dead first then completely charge it. I don&#x27;t know it that prolonged the battery life but that method has worked for me. It truly is an amazing product and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ll add that all my life I&#x27;ve had problem skin and although there is no fixed product to use with this tool, I have seen a tremendous difference in using the product alone vs. using the products in conjunction with the Clarisonic. It really is ALL that they say it is and so much more. Thanks Clarisonic for such an amazing product. Durability and effectiveness is EXCELLENT! If this one ever goes bad, I&#x27;ll definitely be getting another one. It may be costly but it was worth it!  Four years! That was the lifespan of my Clarisonic. It was great whilst it lasted! I need a new one but I see this model is no longer on the market. Any suggestions anyone?</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. I keep it in the shower. The charge holds for a long time before I need to charge it up again. I just love it. I feel like I get a really good cleaning with it, but it&#x27;s not abrasive. My skin loves it too. I think the replacement brushes are expensive, but all worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Clarisonic for almost 3 years now and I still love it! It helps me remove all my oil and makeup from the day and just makes my face feel very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; overall. Although, that is not my favorite part of this little gadget. I regularly do face peels using Lactic Acid or Glycolic Acid which can make my skin peel after a few days. Using the Clarisonic helps accelerate this peeling process and remove all the dead skin cells faster! I can also say that the customer service is fantastic. My last one stopped working on the highest setting after about one year, and they sent me a brand new one within a week--no questions asked! Also the three year warranty restarted on my new unit, which is wonderful! I enjoy using the body attachment that comes with the Pro on my chest, back, knees, and even elbows. All over a wonderful unit!! :-)</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied by this tool! I have to admit you probably don&#x27;t need the 4 speeds but my friend who is an esthetician told me to go with the pro and so I did. It does exfoliate my skin gently and I have noticed my skin absorbes face lotion much better and it looks clearer and smoother.  I use it every night before I go to bed and I still have not had to recharge since the 2nd week of January it so it looks like the battery life is really good. Also, I have been using the body brush on my elbows and knees and it does help getting rid of nasty dead skin in those areas.  I have only tried one of the products that comes with the package and it&#x27;s ok, they are all travel sizes so I am saving them for when I go out of town. So far I have used the clarisonic with my Clinique face wash and as I said it works great. So 5 stars for me!</li>
    <li> My mother recommended the Clarisonic because she loves hers but I was still skeptical.  After reading several reviews I decided to make the investment and I a VERY pleased.  I purchased this \\&quot;pro\\&quot; version.  I am 36 years old and have had problems with acne over the past few years and have spent all kinds of money on all kinds of products.  Prior to getting the Clarisonic I started using the very inexpensive Cetaphil anti-bacteria bar and it works like a charm so I did not use any of the products that came with the Clarisonic.  Just using the Cetaphil helped with the acne but my skin was not nearly as smooth and clear as it has been since using the Clarisonic.  My skin feels and looks FANTASTIC! I use it once a day and follow up with plain Oil of Olay for sensitive skin.  So I&#x27;m using the same skin products as I was before,I just added the Clarisonic and I really can tell a huge difference.  I honestly did not expect such great results!  THIS PRODUCT DELIVERS ON ITS PROMISES!!</li>
    <li> The item I received did not appear to be in new condition. Th Clarisonic package has a clear sign of being opened previously. Since it is a very personal item, I will not accept any used product. I am going to return it!!</li>
    <li> Works really well. I would not use if you use botox though. It seems to make mine loose its strength a lot quicker.</li>
    <li> My pre-teen daughter has a Clarisonic Mia, and we&#x27;ve been impressed with how well it cleans her face, and breakouts have been minimized. I tried it and was amazed by how smooth my middle-aged skin was! I deal with some roughness on my upper arms and wanted either the Plus or the Pro so that I could try the body brush on my arms and my dry elbows and knees.  My Clarisonic Pro finally arrived today. It&#x27;s currently charging, so I assume that it works. However, I will say that I was disappointed in how long it took Amazon to fill my order. I was told that the order would arrive between the 12th and the 18th--and it DID arrive between those dates. However, it didn&#x27;t ship from Amazon until the 12th! My packages usually ship quickly and arrive at the earliest estimated time--even with free standard shipping! Perhaps the company has spoiled me (though this is part of the reason I&#x27;m an ardent Amazon customer), but I thought that waiting until the 1st of the expected package arrival dates to actually ship the package was a little ridiculous. I was pleased with Amazon&#x27;s pricing on Clarisonic products, but in the future it may be best to go straight to Clarisonic for purchases, especially if you need them quickly.  I am also missing my owner&#x27;s manual for the Clarisonic Pro. It charges differently from the Mia, so it took me several minutes just to figure out how it fit in the charging station. I assume that I can go to the Clarisonic website and perhaps read or download a copy, but that seems troublesome. The package was in good shape and had its seals intact, so this may be a manufacturer&#x27;s packaging mistake.  I&#x27;m otherwise happy with the Clarisonic itself.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely easy to use and only takes a minute. I already see a difference in my skin and it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> So far, I bought this thing on Friday... it is now Tuesday afternoon and they still haven&#x27;t shipped it. I&#x27;m disappointed. I could have had this already if I&#x27;d have ordered the Clarisonic from their website.</li>
    <li> I MUST SAY I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING WONDERFUL.  AT FIRST I USED IT ONCE A DAY BUT, FOUND MY SKIN BROKE OUT.  AFTER MANY TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS, I NOW USE IT 2 X A WEEK BUT MY SKIN DOES NOT SEEM TO BE PROFITING FROMIT ALL.  I FEEL LIKE I WASTED A LOT OF MONEY AND AM SORRY I BOUGHT IT.</li>
    <li> I use it often.  It has made a difference.  Easy to use and keep clean.  Money very well spent. Friends tell me that I do not look my age, over 60 years. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all of the hype as to how well it works. I do use it on a regular basis, but even though I use the acne head and the acne cleanser, it does not work much better than my washcloth did. Had I known that I would probably buy the cheaper version instead of the pro version. As for the body brush, I see absolutely no difference in my skin where I use it. I still have red bumps in the same places I had them before I used this. I do like the beepers when I am using the face brush so you know when to switch areas, but the beeper to tell you it needs to be recharged is barely audible with the shower running.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product.  Makes my skin look and feel new, smooth, and clean.  What else can I say?  It&#x27;s like getting a facial at home.  My skin products absorb much better when I use it.  It&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go into much detail about how the product works because I purchased it at my wife&#x27;s request. She is very happy to have it, she uses it frequently, and I think her skin looks fantastic since she&#x27;s started using it. Also, she likes that I got her the one she wanted rather than a less expensive version of this device.</li>
    <li> I love this.I bought  this from Amazon and it came with really good condition. Now, 2 year late, it still work well.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my wife. She was apprehensive about it at first but began noticing positive results in a few days. Her skin is so much smoother and younger looking</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for christmas and she absolutely loves it. It is a very good and durable product</li>
    <li> I bought this when I started seeing acne and rough spots on my face. It works great and feels great to use it. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This has been an excellent purchase. I use it every day to take off my makeup and i truly feel as if it is cleaning my skin effectively, and removing all of the oil and the dirt. I run a small blog, and even dedicated an entire blog entry to it.  I hope you enjoy it: [...]</li>
    <li> I decided to by the Clarisonic PRO after reading multiple reviews of the product and by watching the info videos from the company. I could not WAIT to get my product in the mail. Finally the day arrived, and the first time I used it on my skin, I could feel an immediate difference in the softness level of my skin. After the first few times, my skin felt like BUTTAH and I was amazed at how moisturized my skin was after applying my usual serums and moisturizers afterward. Even when I would awake the next morning, my skin still feels soft. I gush about it to my colleagues at work and my friends. I encourage everyone to get one. If you are on a budget, the basic models will work. I have not yet tried the body brush yet but I am sure I will like it on my dry spots on my heels and elbows. I should register the product this week. Already I want to purhase the basic model for my best friend&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s birthday. SO glad I finally have this! Those images of all the residual \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; left on your face with the normal manual method is just disgusting!&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The first few times I did the high and medium setting. I think I will go on the low setting tonight as I don&#x27;t want my skin to get too irritated; it works THAT well.</li>
    <li> Whenever you have the choice of multiple models and the difference is less than $100 for the top of the line, well, I would pick the best. That is what I did here. I was actually hesitant to purchase at first because all the reviews talk about &amp;#34;breaking out&amp;#34; and how bad your skin looks, etc. Well, just like when you have a facial, it bring out all of the impurities and makes sense that you would either break out or have &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; as they call it. My skin is so soft, looks great and yes, I did have some minor breakouts about a week into using it but the key is to keep using it. If your skin is sensitive, get the acne prone brush (Not sure of the name but that&#x27;s what I got). If you use it twice a day you will see a difference. I&#x27;ve always had pretty nice skin but lately have had hormonal breakouts, fine lines and my pores seemed a bit larger (at least they did to me) so I decided to give it a try. After using this for almost a month, my skin looks great. A friend of mine said I was &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t even wearing makeup. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> the clarisonic prosonic skin cleansing is perfect for my (your) face and body! It comes with the body brush and the face brush. it doesn&#x27;t come with the 4 small tubes presented in the picture.it only comes with the small body pumice and cleanser for face. I bought an extra extension handle cause I didn&#x27;t know whether it came with the body extension handle. to my surprise, this set came in with a body extension handle came as is in perfect condition(New)!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product in July, 2012, received it within 2 days of order.  It came well packaged and with good instructions.  It has four speeds which are easily changeable as you cleanse your face or body.  The brushes are easy to remove.  It is not heavy but just the right weight to feel substantial.  I previously used the Olay Cleansing System (over a year), and thought it did a really great job.  This is a huge step up and worth every penny.  It has really cleansed me from head to toe and my skin is super soft and supple.  I have normal skin and my husband has oily, (both in our mid-50s) we have both found it works equally well for both of us.  I would not hesitate to recommend me this to anyone who is looking to cleanse and have a smoother appearance to their skin.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I only used it twice, then I got pregnant and got very lazy to use it again. Now being 5 months pregnant and my skin is breaking out with acne&#x27;s, I made a promise to myself to get it out of the closet and use it again. Lets hope it makes my pregnancy \\&quot;hormones\\&quot; acne better even if its helps a little bit!!</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic Pro Sonic...My skin feels and looks amazing...I was using the Olay Pro-X cleansing system which works well and is worth the price and if you don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money on the Clarisonic...Granted there is a huge price difference between the two but the cleansing results are huge also...I personally feel that it&#x27;s worth it...My skin is so smooth and it just glows...It cleanses my skin so well that it allows my lotions and serums to be absorbed much better therefore allowing them to work much better...even my makeup goes on and looks better...I also find that I&#x27;m not using as much makeup because I don&#x27;t need to...Buying it through Amazon was a plus...I got it at a good price...I saved myself a lot of money...I&#x27;m happy with it  :)</li>
    <li> This is the first time a product like this, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks. I have yet to see any improvements.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I can see the difference of my skin. I would recommend this item for anyone who want&#x27;s smoother and cleaner skin!</li>
    <li> I went back and forth for weeks trying to decide if it was worth spending the money on the Clarisonic. Obviously, I did. Let me tell you I love this little thing. I didn&#x27;t use the cleaner that came with it- I love the Ole Henriksen African Red Tea foaming cleanser. The Clarisonic and cleanser work fantastic together. I did have a small break out the first two weeks, nothing terrible. I really like how great my skin feels after I wash with it. My bragging about the feel of my skin even sparked my husbands curiosity, so much so that he uses the Clarisonic too!!! My face lotion seems to get absorbed so quickly and my skin has never looked better. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! If you are on the fence about getting one, do your skin a favor and get it!</li>
    <li> I am beyond livid right now.  First let me say that I LOVE my Clarisonic Pro.  I bought it on Amazon in November of 2011 and immediately noticed a change in my skin.  But now, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge...at all.  To further exacerbate the situation, Clarisonic will not honor the warranty since it was bought online at Amazon.  I will be replacing this unit.  Just mad that I can&#x27;t get the warranty honored due to it being an Amazon purchase...</li>
    <li> Gives you a nice clean feeling and is gentle.  I have had my clarisonic since before Valentine&#x27;s day and just love it.  I notice my 40 year old face looks &#x27;fresher&#x27; and although I can&#x27;t claim I have less wrinkles or what not -- I notice a difference in how my face looks - especially without makeup.  If you can afford it - get it!  I&#x27;d also recommend Philosophy&#x27;s facial cleanser - works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I am 53 years old and my skin feels so soft after using the Clairsonic for over a month now.  I am so sold on it I bought my daughter one so that she can reap the benefits starting early in her adult life.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product when I went for a facial a few months ago.  I use the cleanser that I purchased from the spa, and every day that I use this, I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten an amazing deep cleanse of my face.  I have oily/ acne prone skin so a clean feel is much better.  It hasn&#x27;t helped much with my breakouts, or that I&#x27;ve noticed, but I love this thing.  Very easy to use and understand too!</li>
    <li> I use top of the line skin products, but NOTHING made the difference that this Clarisonic has. I use it ALL over this past 50 body. My skin has changed so much and it makes my skin products work better with all the dead skin cells removed. You will love it, too. PROMISE!!!</li>
    <li> The boss lady ask for this for her birthday. I did some research on it before I commited to buy. I have used it my self and it works great.</li>
    <li> This item is pretty good at cleaning and smoothing out your skin. Works well even for a guy like me, I&#x27;m out in the open a lot at work. It has a self regulated timer for you to move the brush to different parts of your face or body. This is a second purchase for me, because my fiancee took over mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two gripe is the packaging said it comes with a face brush and a body brush, but I didn&#x27;t get my body brush. The other is the pricing. The brushes are not cheap. There are off brands you could buy, but I don&#x27;t want to risk it. This is for your face, so don&#x27;t go taking a chance on it.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this for a long time!  When I ordered it, I was very pleased that the product arrived on time and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> I purchased this roughly six months ago and I love it! It is now part of my daily cleaning process. It definitely caused me to break out, initially, but now...I&#x27;m almost clear. I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me a bit. I will give one suggestion - do NOT push down while exfoliating. Just gently move across your face. I feel so much better after using this - I cannot imagine my life without it. SAd, but true!!!! You will LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> So I ordered this product via a Groupon special and loved it...for three weeks. With normal ice a day use the motor went and it no longer spins. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m only out fifty bucks. Sadly I didn&#x27;t save the box so we will see if I can get a replacement with just my receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pay full price. The quality is poor. Even if it hasn&#x27;t broke, I still was bummed it only had a few speeds and no other features.</li>
    <li> My skin has never been so smooth or clear! Cleared all my acne up, even on my back. Wished i had bought one years ago.</li>
    <li> My clarasonic died within nine months of purchase.  Since it was a Pro, Clarisonic would not back up its product as it was bought over the Internet and not from a dermatologist office.  Very dissatisfied with Clarisonic&#x27;s customer service and shotty product.</li>
    <li> I think its a good product ...all in all i can&#x60;t say anything negative about it.  The actual brush felt a bit rough on my face and it was somewhat scratchy.  the most important thing though is if your skin is ACNE PRONE as mine is, the sonic action of this unit actually overstimulates as it cleans and this made my acne worse.  i&#x60;ve been playing with it ...a week on and then a week off.  without fail, the week i use it, i have more aggravated acne.  Week im off it and i just use my exfoliating gloves (99c)  i get a thorough clean and i don&#x60;t have breakouts.  I was very disappointed because this is an expensive product and it just didn&#x60;t agree with my specific kind of skin.  Each person it different so your experience may be completely different to mine.  Good luck!  be cautious if you&#x60;re Acne prone.[[ASIN:B001QOGXOG Clarisonic Pro For Face and Body 4 Speeds - White]]</li>
    <li> After you use this for a couple months you will notice a difference.  Your face feels so clean and looks great.</li>
