<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was kind of cool how this made little patterns by just applying it like you would regular polish. But don&#x27;t swipe the nail more than twice or it will start covering it in a solid blob. For the dark colors, you start with a light (white? silver? pink?) first coat, dry, then apply the Shatter polish. For Lighter Shatter colors, start with a darker base coat of other polish first. otherwise there won&#x27;t be any contrast. Finish by applying a clear top coat to seal it, or it won&#x27;t feel smooth and the little ridges from the Shatter coat will catch in clothes, rub or flake off when washing your hair, doing chores, etc. Reapply more clear polish or top coat again the next day after checking to see if you need small repairs. In fact, I&#x27;ve used Shatter to camouflage wear and tear on a regular 4/5-day-old nail job when I don&#x27;t want to start all over again, just to extend it a few more days and give my solid color some zing for the weekend, for example. You will have fun trying different combinations if you get yourself a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; set of red, black, green, pink, etc. Especially red and black.</li>
    <li> You have to be quick putting this on as one layer.  Just be sure that the nail polish you have on underneath is dry or else it won&#x27;t turn out right.</li>
    <li> The nail polish came so fast! Way before planned! I am so happy and the nail polish is working fantastically! Thanks OPI and whoever shipped my products!!!</li>
    <li> Another great product from OPI! The only problem is finding a nail tech that is skilled enough to apply it properly.  Try it with lavender or neon pink underneath.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff, it looks great with bright colors under it. Mine came 1 day quicker than the expected delivery date. I just wish they made it in all colors.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest polish ever.  I have had nothing but compliments on it from the young and the old.  Super cool.  Hope more colors are coming.</li>
    <li> What are prople raving about???  this product sucks!  I applied it according to directions, and the final effect was nothing like \\&quot;shattered\\&quot;, more like \\&quot;streaky\\&quot;!!  All my co-workers agree, they have bought it and think the product is horrible.</li>
    <li> its great I&#x27;ve worn it with a few different colors and i always get complimented on my nails and it lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Thank you for the fast shipment. I had looked everywhere from a 50 milie radius from my house and could not find this fingernail polish. I love it. thanks.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is excellent! The thicker coat you put on, the more black you have on your nails. I was surprised how well it worked! It is by far the BEST crackle nail polish available!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Sometimes I layer it with a silver, metallic hot pink or purple and the effect is perfect! You don&#x27;t even have to be perfect about it, just slap it on and it is dry in seconds! Just make sure the colored layers underneath are totally dry before you put the shatter coat on..Get a quick dry top coat and you good to go!</li>
    <li> the first time i used this is came out awesome ( i layered it over a metallic purple/gold chade) the second time i try to use it it became a watery, non-shatter effect. so i disposed of it after many attempts. the other colors work much better.</li>
    <li> the nail polish is a great color.  It would look great over pretty much any color.  I tried applying it over a yellow/gold color and it turned out great.  I think this option might be the best pairing for the two colors</li>
    <li> I love the look shatter gives on my nails. I tried a couple of the cheaper ones but to me they didn&#x27;t look as nice as this one. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I bought this the very first time i used it i noticed it was very thick and resulted in it not want to \\&quot;crack\\&quot; right so was leaving big black globs not sure what happened it just started clumping up i wouldnt by op again  not for crackle at least</li>
    <li> I got this nail polish as soon as it came out! The Katy Perry Shatter by OPI! I love it. The only down side is it gets kind of clumpy, but I still use it and it looks great over every color!</li>
    <li> There was a lot of hype for this product in the Cosmetology field and I thought I might as well try it out, being a nail polish guru myself. They were sold out in stores so I proceeded to buy from Amazon and when it came, I tried it on and was not happy.&lt;br /&gt;Some of my co-workers like this product but I guess it all depends on personal taste. I think it gives a \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; look because it is black shatter and makes your nails look dark while still being able to see the polish underneath.&lt;br /&gt;This polish darkens the polish underneath so it is better to put it over a bright or light color and not a dark color like navy or dark purple.</li>
    <li> If this site had half a star thats what I would have gave them! I cant belive how dumb I was thinking that it would look like this in the picture. It&#x27;s flat black with no kinda shine I don&#x27;t get it at all. I thought you get what you pay for so I bought it for $9 waited almost 2 weeks before it came in the mail.just for me to feel the mud on my face.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this polish and so do I!  Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Don&#x27;t use it thick.    Use a base polish,apply crackle(thin layer) and watch. It looks really nice.    Used on a couple of toes!</li>
    <li> The best thing out there!!!  Love this nail product,it is a great way to jazz up your nail polish.  After you use it make sure to put a clear coat on top to protect and give it shine!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish. It is so easy to use and fun. I&#x27;ve worn it constantly with different colors. It goes best with bright or metallic colors so you can really see the shatter effect. If you use it on dark colors it doesn&#x27;t look as great.</li>
    <li> i love what it does!  but before you use it, try to watch the tutorial for the product on youtube to prevent making newbie mistakes.  i&#x27;m looking forward to the silver shatter.</li>
    <li> This arrived quite a few days earlier than the estimated time! And the product is SO great! Such a cool effect for your nails! People kept asking \\&quot;Whoa! Did you go get those done?\\&quot; and \\&quot;You did that yourself??\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love this Black Shatter polish from OPI.  It is a great inexpensive design for those that don&#x27;t want to spend a lot at the nail salon, but like polish on their nails.  I tried it with a pink base color and it looks great.  OPI&#x27;s Shatter polish is better than the China Glaze Crackle collection.  It doesn&#x27;t go on as thick.  Can&#x27;t wait to receive the Silver Shatter polish.</li>
    <li> the only thing that i dont like is tht the polish is really thick!! i have to go get some paint thinner to thin it out so it works properly</li>
    <li> The crackle cracks so beautiful, the only thing that i dont like is that it gets crust at the top but i believe its because of the chemicals inside. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest invention to the nail polish world, since well...nail polish! Apply 2 coats of your base color and then one coat of this nail polish. The trick is to get enough black shatter on the applicator brush to cover the whole nail, don&#x27;t double dip! With a clear base coat &amp; top coat my nails lasted about a week.</li>
    <li> I love my Black Shatter nail polish. It crackles almost immediately after application and dries quickly. You need to put a top coat on to really make the color underneath stand out and to make the Back Shatter shiny. If you put it on thick, you get large cracks. If you put it on thin, you get fine cracks. Either way, it looks great and I get compliments on my nails all the time with this on.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this shatter polish at first, but I&#x27;m now a BIG fan of it! When used CORRECTLY, it makes a very cool effect over your other polish. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on just your nails by itself (it looks streaky and wrong). It dries to a matte finish. However, it looks great over bright colors, and even better when you apply a clear top coat over it. I can&#x27;t wait to buy this in other colors!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this nail polish after another friend had it. called all over and it was sold out everywhere. got from Amazon within 5 days at a great price and I didnt have to drive all over. It works great and my daughter was very happy to find it in her Easter basket.</li>
    <li> I looove this nail polish!I&#x27;ve used the nail polish over my pink nail polish and i&#x27;ve gotten alot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the China Glaze Crackle polishes weren&#x27;t available in any of the beauty supply stores near my house. This purchase turned out to be more fantastic than expected. I used the polish the first chance I got and got rave reviews from everyone who saw it on my nails. I loved loved LOVED the way it crackled on my nails and I&#x27;m not even going to bother looking for the other polishes since I have this one. I enjoyed the nice price, prompt shipping, and great quality. My only complaint would be that the polish dries very quickly so I had to be very careful when painting my nails but other than that, fabulous product and I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This is a very good nail polish.I used it with Avon nail enamel red.you should put a clear nail polish on top.</li>
    <li> The Black Opi Shatter is wonderful! It&#x27;s amazing to see how it works after you put it on your nails. I love it! Cool design. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations for this and was really excited when I received it in the mail. I had seen tons of reviews, both text and video and they were all positive. But when I first tried it on I was really disappointed. First it has a weird consistency and is quite lumpy. So it does not go on smoothly AT ALL. And it dries weird too. It looks and feels like you have tacky tar on your fingernails. As for the \\&quot;shatter\\&quot; it just look like someone painted black gook onto my fingernails and then dragged a toothpick through the substance to give it \\&quot;crackles\\&quot;. It makes my nails look horrible and really cheap and honestly kind of like white trash. It is absolutely nothing like you see on videos. And you  have to put a top coat on or it looks chalky and will probably flake off within the first 5 minutes of wearing it. I was so disappointed and honestly I want my money back!</li>
    <li> I used a white shatter for the first few times and it came out gorgeous. But after about four times I used it, It started to get into clumps. i used it the most i could, but soon the whole thing became a large clump like a wet foundasion applier. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get anything out.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT,  AFTER APPLYING THIS BLACK K.P. SHATTER POLISH, I HAVE HAD SOOOOOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS, ASKING WHERE I GOT IT.  MY DOCTOR&#x27;S NURSE GRABBED MY HAND AND SAID \\&quot;OH, HOW DIFFERENT, I LIKE IT, WHERE DID YOU GET IT\\&quot;  I TOLD HER AMAZON.COM........IT IS SOOOOO POPULAR HERE THEY CAN&#x27;T KEEP IT IN THE STORES, OR BEAUTY SHOPS............GET SOME YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail polish.  It looks so good on top of my coral red nail polish.  Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The polish itself is great. Opi is great. But what I got was a used nail polish already opened...and with dried nail polish leaking out. I wasn&#x27;t aware I was buying a used product.</li>
    <li> This nail polish works just as it is demonstrated. I received this item very quickly after my order was processed.[[ASIN:B004Q8PE1C OPI Katy Perry Collection, Black Shatter, 0.5-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I got this polish along with the teenage dream and last friday night.  I LOVE the shatter.  It looks fabulous.  I really like the matte finish.  I work as a cashier, and i get so many comments and compliments...even from guys.  I was blown away by how many men know what this nail polish is called.  I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other colors.</li>
    <li> i just received the polish, the other day and it works. any of the reviews that states this product doesnt work is wrong. They just didnt apply it correctly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited almost 6 months for this and finally got my hands on a bottle yesterday, I am sadly disappointed. I let the base polish dry completely and then put this on, unless something I am doing is wrong, it looks like a chalkboard and just BLAH.</li>
    <li> The nail polish looks great. took a few tries to get used to applying it since it works slightly differently then regular polish. deff recommend it</li>
    <li> I love OPI, but this polish dries out really quickly. You should try to use one coat to get better results. Overall, I like the crackle effect and it works well, but the application could be better.</li>
    <li> I recieved this nail polish brand new, cheaper than trying to find it in stores that have been sold out, and I recieved it a lot sooner than was expected. Very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, yet was used and only about 3/4ths full. Dried polish all around the edges. Great product yet, wish I got it new like description said.</li>
    <li> i bought a bunch of these as gifts for young girls, I think the resounding review is it dries too fast!!! But the effects are good.</li>
    <li> It came out really cool after I learned to apply it, but after a month, the nail polish dried up inside the bottle. I wasn&#x27;t storing it in an unusual manner and I never left the top unsealed, so I don&#x27;t know why this would happen. Maybe mine was defective, but the few uses I got out of it were not worth the price. I&#x27;m surprised this hasn&#x27;t happened to more people. I love OPI, but the Katy Perry crackle line didn&#x27;t cut it. I blame her.</li>
    <li> Bought this nail polish for my daughter for Valentines and she and all of her friends love it. It&#x27;s a fun way to change up your nail polish.</li>
    <li> This nail lacquer looks cool when applied. The cracked or shattered effect   is quite different. The four stars is due to the price. I paid double for  this bottle. It is normally $8. at salons but since it is a popular item,  the price was $16. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this polish off amazon when I was unable to find it in any of the salons I visited.  Everywhere I went, the owners said they could not keep it on the shelves.  It gives a really cool effect to any nail polish for special occasions or days when you just want to feel special!  I get lots of comments on it, especially when I wear it on top of hot pink!  I saw in a magazine that O.P.I. is about to release a silver shatter and I can&#x27;t wait!!  Very fun polish!!</li>
    <li> Opi is a great quality of nail polish. I will only by opi for this reason. Opi seems to not chip as much as other nail polishes. Love the different names!</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed with this polish. I thought it would be a shatter look, but it&#x27;s more like zebra stripes. Also, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I put it on at night and by mid-afternoon the next day it looked terrible.</li>
    <li> Great product. It came without delay. I would highly recommend purchasing this amazing nail polish trend from this vendor to anyone who wants prompt assistance.</li>
    <li> Having used shatter or crackle polish by OPI, LaRosa and China Glaze, I have some basis for comparison.  They all work, it&#x27;s your subjective taste that matters. The LaRosa shatter pattern is sort of a random pattern.  The China Glaze is more like a snakeskin shaped pattern.  In my opinion, the OPI is the nicest - it&#x27;s clean and geometric, like tiny parallel rectangles.    The OPI is easiest to work with too.  It&#x27;s got a less gloppy or thick formula, so it goes on more cleanly, and shatters more intricately. It&#x27;s a true black, nice and dark, covering any base coat well.  It&#x27;s too bad OPI came out of the gate with the black and has been slow about other colors.  Fortunately other manufacturers have stepped more quickly into the blooming shatter market.    If you haven&#x27;t used a crackle or shatter polish, please read on.  These are a lot of fun, and look great.  It makes me crazy when I see reviews of disappointed people saying \\&quot;It didn&#x27;t work\\&quot; and you can usually tell they either didn&#x27;t get directions with the product, or didn&#x27;t read them.    The point of crackle polish is to use two colors which contrast.  You apply a base coat of regular nail polish, and then paint the crackle polish on top, which shrinks as it dries to expose the base color.  Thus, whatever you choose for your base should be a color that will contrast nicely with the color of crackle you have.  The more different the colors (light and dark) the more obvious the pattern will be.    Crackle polish will NOT work on your naked nail- as it dries it shrinks and it needs a smooth dry surface to shrink across.    The key is to put the crackle polish on when the base color is COMPLETELY dry.  Then it will \\&quot;shatter\\&quot; correctly.  It takes a few seconds or more for the crackle polish to work its magic and contract, so after putting it on, relax and watch it.  It&#x27;s kind of like watching an old Poloroid develop.  If you find spots that are blank and you want to carefully fill them in afterwards, you can.     Threethings I have found regardless of the crackle or shatter brand:     1) It is thick, so you really want to shake, stir and roll the bottle between your palms to get it well-mixed.      2) Crackle polishes all dry matte (dull and un-shiney) so unless you like that look, you will want to apply some clear top coats to get shine and to level the layers.      3) If you want small, fine crackles, go light with the crackle polish.  If you want a chunkier look with larger sections of crackle, go thicker.    Good luck!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am really into doing my nails, pretty much every other day and I am just so happy I could add this polish to my collection!</li>
    <li> I loved this when I first got it. After the first use it became super thick inside the bottle and started to shatter itself around the opening. I added some acetone to it, which I do to all of my nail polishes when they thicken up and hoped it didn&#x27;t have an affect on the \\&quot;shatter\\&quot;. It didn&#x27;t. In fact it worked better than the first time I used it. I ended up getting other colors by different brands, including OPI for Sephora in a metallic silver (which I havent had a single issue with since I got it July &#x27;11), but after a few weeks, I noticed that this black polish completely dried out inside the bottle. It even separated itself from the bottle so all that was left was a little ball of dried nail polish that no amount of acetone could save. Judging by the other comments, it was not the acetone that did this but the polish itself. I don&#x27;t usually spend this much on nail polish and have found cheaper alternatives since then. I strongly suggest going to CVS or something and buying their $7 crackle, which also works great along with the OPI for Sephora line.</li>
    <li> Although the shatter polish does exactly as described, in the end it just looks messy. Its awesome towatch as the color crackles before your eyes! When I was done with all my nails, it looked like a fiveyear old had painted them. The effect is cool from afar, but close up looks horrible. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money and buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in store because I was looking for a black shatter and could not wait for it to be shipped. I&#x27;m not a nail polish expert but I can tell the difference between high and low quality nail polish....if someone had given this bottle to me and covered the brand name I would have assumed it was a dollar store quality shatter. I was very disappointed because I know OPI is a great brand, but it will be the last time I buy their Shatter.  I own some China Glaze crackle and love it, it goes on thick and gives a nice cracked effect. It was not the case with OPI. Upon applying, it went on like regular nail polish (actually more like bad quality polish, very very thin)and was not very dark. Honestly I didn&#x27;t like this shatter pattern at all.  I read the reviews and thought maybe I was being too harsh and tried it again, this time applying it thicker in hopes that I would be proven wrong. It was worse, it wouldn&#x27;t go on evenly and sections with thicker polish wouldn&#x27;t even shatter (figures).   In my opinion, this stuff sucks....go with China Glaze if you can.</li>
    <li> Bought it in person and just tried it last night.  Absolutely LOVE IT!!!  Did it on my toes but since you can&#x27;t see it as good, it just looks messy unless you know about this.  But definitely recommend this for fingers!  Used one of the Katy Perry colors with it and it came out great.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it with other colors!  Wish they would do the shatter in other colors too.</li>
    <li> Love the crackle design....so different....unique....people are always stopping me to ask about my nails....The girls at the salon were even in aww..They had never seen it before...will definitly buy again.</li>
    <li> Last weekend finally decided to look for the shatter nail polish and every place I went was sold out.  Yesterday discovered it at our gift shop in the hospital where I work, there prices are typically high but to my surprise it was only $7.99.  I polished my nails days before in a crimson color so I was kinda worried that it would not work well on my long natural nails.  I was like a kid in a candy store my eyes brighten up as I watched the shatter take effect, posted a picture on fb and I am very happy with my purchase. Does make u think how did they do that?</li>
    <li> This was so fun and I got it pretty quick. Gotta be carefull u don&#x27;t put it on to thick</li>
    <li> I love this polish!  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.  I do my nails myself and this was very easy to use.  Dries fast and you see the shatter effect almost immediately.  After a couple of times I&#x27;ve figured how thick to put it on, depending on how I want the \\&quot;shater\\&quot; affect to turn out.</li>
    <li> I had no doubt that an OPI product would deliver on what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and sure enough you put a single coat down and it shatters.  I recommend experimenting with it a bit just to make sure you&#x27;re getting the right consistency, and I&#x27;ll definitely be playing around a bit more to create different effects with it.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical because my product came damaged, although it did arrive very quickly. I emailed the seller and they replaced my item, free of charge, without me having to send the damaged product back. All of this was done within days of sending the email. I will definitely purchase from them again!!!</li>
    <li> Super fun product!  Just make sure the color you use underneath has dried for HOURS before applying the shatter.  The Shatter dries almost instantly and was surprisingly easy to remove with nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> I got away from the shattered years ago, and then tried this again, and fell right back in love with it.</li>
    <li> I used this nail polish and it was great, it started to shatter immediately the look was fantastic, I got a lot of complements, I think its best when you use a bright color as the base color so when it starts to shatter it shows better I used a hot pink and it was awsome</li>
    <li> This nail polish is so fun! I love the way it looks, but it does not last very long compared to other OPI nail polish I have tried. I would not use this polish without a top-coat. It is also hard to just do a touch-up without having to redo the entire nail. The polish is a little clumpy, so don&#x27;t be afraid. It also looks bad when you first put it on, but once it \\&quot;shatters\\&quot; it looks great! I would definitely recommend this polish :)</li>
    <li> My package came earlier than I expected, so I was very pleased! And the product was brand new as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I knew I lived this polish already but tried another similar product because it was cheaper and came in different colors....well shortly after OPI released more colors! Thank goodness because the other product was not as good!</li>
    <li> I found that this is the the best thing out there for nails that hold up longer!!! Love this nail product because it holds up and is affordable ,it is a great way to jazz up your nail polish. After you use it make sure to put a clear coat on top to protect and give it shine that lasts longer than other products!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail polish!!! It looks great and works exactly the way its advertised too. I would definitely tell anyone thinking about ordering to go for it! You will absolutely love it!!!! The directions that come attached to the bottle are easy to follow and your nails will look awesome when done. Make sure to use a clear coat over the top, it adds shine and makes the color under the black pop out! The company that sent it to me had it in the mail and to me 3 days earlier than date of receipt projected when I ordered.</li>
    <li> Everywhere I go I have somebody complimenting my nails, and asking me about them, telling me how much they like them. It&#x27;s a must have for any nail polish collection, I&#x27;m going to be purchasing the shatter in silver ASAP so I can wear it with dark shades too! Best part? even if you have trouble with the painting your right hand, it doesn&#x27;t matter with this stuff because it&#x27;s not supposed to be perfect, and touch ups are hardly noticeable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** 12/31/11&lt;br /&gt;For some reason the polish is all goopey and gross already. It is very difficult to use, and I&#x27;m not really happy about it... don&#x27;t really understand what happened...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** 2/11/12&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so thick and goopey that It&#x27;s completely un-usable. even if i am able to get it smoothly across my nail, it no longer will \\&quot;evaporate\\&quot; (or however it works to create the \\&quot;shattered\\&quot; look). I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is amazing! When it dries black is not the most predominate color. The base color shows just as much as the black. The only draw back is that when you wipe the excess polish onto the side of the bottle it cakes on there untill you shake the bottle the next time you use it. But all in all a good product.</li>
    <li> I like this somewhat but not as much as I do the glitter polishes. Ive used the black on top of several base coats but the black always seems to overpower any other shades which I use. It does well to shatter but the color doesnt blend well enough; my nails always look more black than anything else. Dries too quickly too and seems to clump on the brush.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s a great way to change you boring day look (think neutral/pinkish color) into something different. Plus once you put on a top coat (a must) it will also extend the life of your manicure. :)</li>
    <li> I think its a really neat nail poish. Just make sure you use a really good top coat or chips pretty fast but I love it with all the color combos you can make. But it did take a little longer to get to me than most things I buy from amazon</li>
    <li> This nail polish is okay - it gets the job done. My bottle just went sticky after a few weeks, so you need to use it up the first week. And only paint one coat over so it cracks evenly. It&#x27;s definitely tricky.</li>
    <li> I super love this. I ordered it because its so cool. I used to get my nails done and always got this. I wanted to have to use for my own use. Stores dont have this, not equal to this product. Yeah its a little pricey, but its worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail polish specifically for Halloween. I bought orange nail polish as the base color and bought this for the top color. I followed the directions and my nails came out so nice. I got so many compliments on my nails I felt flattered especially being that this was my first time using the shatter. You have to make sure the base coat is completely dry and that you use a thin layer of shatter otherwise your nails will not look the way you want them to. I love this shatter and will definitely be getting myself more shatters in different colors. Do not hesitate to buy this product because you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all.  It didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;shatter,&amp;#34; it looked like you painted your nails and didn&#x27;t let them finish drying completely before washing the dishes.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Looks very interesting. A perfect look for Halloween and every day. Looks best with silver polish used underneath.</li>
    <li> I took my new Shatter nail polish to my salon.  I used white underneath for a \\&quot;classic\\&quot; look.  I had so many compliments and it lasted for over 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> I first bought this nail polish when this \\&quot;Shatter\\&quot; trend was really popular at school and i was really happy that it came super fast and that the price wasn&#x27;t too bad either. I immediatley tested it and loved the way it looked and got so many compliments. Now my complain is that it dries and clumps up really fast. It wouldn&#x27;t even take a minute for it to clump up and the next time i went to use it, I was really hard to open the bottle. Although i really loved this Shatter look, i dont think i&#x27;ll purchase this specific brand again.</li>
    <li> When I got it it seemed used/ a bit dried out. Though it did work well the look grew old and the polish thickened quickly. Not a huge fan!</li>
    <li> I recently saw this polish on a co-worker and fell in love with it. I then started scouring the beauty supply stores, nail salons, Walgreen&#x27;s. ANYWHERE I could think of to get this polish! Well, I gave up trying to find it...so I turned to Amazon.     I ordered it on 4/19 and received it today (4/22). I just finished putting it on and I love it! &lt;3 I did a white base (two coats) let them dry until they were no longer sticky and then put on a fairly thick coat of Shatter. It starts \\&quot;shattering\\&quot; with in seconds. It dries super fast. Almost to a rubbery finish, I found that after it dried completely (I gave it a good 20 mins) I put a shiny top coat over it.    Here are some awesome base colors (my friends have used them):    -White  -Hot Pink  -Bright Sky Blue  -Mint  -Coral  -Orange  -Silver    Hope this helps! You can find a \\&quot;How to\\&quot; on Youtube that shows real time drying and effects! Have fun and shatter on!</li>
    <li> What a great concept!  Nail polish that actually shatters to show the color beneath.  Love it!  Goes on smoothly and does exactly what they say.  Was mailed promptly which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I love it!  But I didn&#x27;t use it for about amonth and half the bottle dried up and is unusable now.  :(</li>
    <li> This does not come out as silver cracks as shown. It was a few broken black cracks that looked messed up when it was all said and done. I&#x27;d like to get either my money back, or a replacement would be nice</li>
    <li> Great polish cracks looks great!!!! The polish dries fast and doing a double coat doesn&#x27;t look the best.... Just have to pratice to get it right</li>
    <li> absolutely love the black crackle! i wear it on top of bright colors and it looks so cute!   the crackle is even helpful with allowing me to go longer without repainting my nails!</li>
    <li> I just ordered this \\&quot;shatter\\&quot; polish after hearing so much about it, and I absolutely L-O-V-E it! It looks exactly like what is supposed to and can be easily varied just by changing the color of the base coat before you apply the shatter polish.  It even makes any mistakes or lumps on the base layer become very unnoticeable.  LOVE this product, and I will probably buy a different colored shatter polish in the near future to add to my collection! :]</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who got a crappy one? If I knew any better I&#x27;d think it was a fake.     I have tried it all. Many brands, super thin coats, super thick coats, and nails that have tried for a day. It ALWAYS looks like a little kid tried painting my nail black, crappy. The one time I had \\&quot;semi-luck\\&quot; it BARELY crackled and I would have been better off just wearing black polish.    I don&#x27;t get it. What&#x27;s wrong with it? Giving this away to someone who might have better luck.    Oh and I have had $0.50 nail polishes that haven&#x27;t gotten as lumpy as this one.    REALLY, OPI, REALLY?</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this nail polish is great!!! It is great for polka dots and makes you nails look awesome!!</li>
    <li> Works nicely, but chips easily.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked. Then I waited a few moments and it started the shatter look. My daughters loved this. It is very hip and at a reasonable price you can&#x27;t beat. Thanks a bunch</li>
    <li> Excellent. My wife loves it and it looks great too. Worth every penny I paid for it. Will buy from again and again!</li>
    <li> Works very well and crackles very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it didn&#x27;t crackle very much, but it&#x27;s not a big deal to me.</li>
    <li> I really liked the idea of this polish, but the actual product was somewhat disappointing. I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old bottle, but the polish was really clumpy and did not produce the shatter effect. It was just like a black coat on top of my nails. I had much better luck with the silver color.</li>
    <li> I love opi, glazes arrived in perfect condition, must update the colors of the season to have more options, all excellent</li>
    <li> Cool and unique product but sometimes there&#x27;s too much black and it doesn&#x27;t really show the shatter effect very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It looks great and as far as she said it is good quality product. recommend</li>
    <li> The classic shatter nail polish. Pretty fun to play with, keep in mind it does dry very fast.</li>
    <li> I love OPI products. The black shatter works well with bright colors.</li>
    <li> I bought this product online when all the stores around me were sold out and I didn&#x27;t want to wait to try it! You simply paint it on over another color (make sure it is REALLY dry or else it might not work correctly) and it looks black at first but then starts to separate into the crackle effect. It looks awesome, especially with white nail polish under! Check out my review coming soon on my blog too at [...] I am going to post a review soon with photos.</li>
    <li> Fun and easy to apply. Nails look like they&#x27;ve been professionaly done because of the unusual effect. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on this!! Best with a high-contrast color underneath. Don&#x27;t over-apply, just a thin coat does the trick. Holds up well even without a topcoat. Because of the crackling, it does feel a little rough or uneven to the touch, so if that kind of thing bugs you, you&#x27;ll want to do a topcoat. I&#x27;m probably a little old to be wearing this as my 20s are long-gone and I don&#x27;t even really know who Katy Perry is, but it&#x27;s fun for a change of pace (and much cheaper than a manicure). I found it cheaper at a local store, but it was hard to find.</li>
    <li> The only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because it dries too quickly in the container (sort of like White Out)and you really do need to use a clear coat or two over the product in order for it not to chip off quickly. Do that though and you have some wicked-cool looking nails!</li>
    <li> I was floored the first time I saw this polish on a customer--very striking and fun! I set out to buy some for myself, only to find out all the stores in my area were sold out. I ordered here on Amazon and got my polish in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this polish is that you can any color under it. I actually like using several colors on each nail, like a stripe of hot pink, then neon orange, then hot pink. I&#x27;ve also tried a random, swirly mix or silver, white, and army green. Both combos looked awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fun to play around with this, but make sure you use decent polish for the colors. You don&#x27;t want to have to paint too many coats of the color. I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but if my polish is too thick, it just chips right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black shatter polish needs to be applied somewhat quickly, and in just a few even strokes to cover the nail(I try to do each nail in just 2 strokes). If you go over the same part twice, it acts like a dry erase marker does--lifts off what&#x27;s already there. A note on thickness--if it&#x27;s too thick, you won&#x27;t get much of a crackle. If it&#x27;s too thin, the crackles are very small &amp; it just looks scratchy. It dries quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smudging the crackles, lol. I&#x27;d do a practice run on an unsuspecting friend or a toe-nail or two, just so you can get a feel for how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like someone else says, the polish thickens in the bottle quite fast. I&#x27;d probably recommend not leaving the cap off any longer than you need to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All &amp; all, I love this stuff! Great purchase!! REcommended!! : )</li>
    <li> Great product, but after a while it get&#x27;s clumpy/thick and the brush needs to be cleaned. Other than that A+ I have 3 bottles!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the effect that this nailpolish gives. At first, it appears as a black nail polish, but then it slowly starts to &#x27;shatter&#x27; and give off this amazing fun look.    My only complaint is the texture of the nailpolish, which is really .. sticky? I don&#x27;t know. It gets stuck onto the brush handle and clumps together easily. Other than that, I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I watched the youtube video to see it in action. It works way better than the Sally Hansen and China Glaze versions.  The shatter pattern is perfect.  I can&#x27;t get enough.  It also gets a lot of attention, people notice and want to know I did it.  OPI!</li>
    <li> Came just as the ad said.  However, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the heat and being shipped or if it&#x27;s just the way the polish is but it&#x27;s extremely thick and doesn&#x27;t come out right.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase nail polish online again, however the person I purchased it from I would definitely buy things from again.  They shipped it when they said they would and the product was as stated.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this stuff! you can actually watch it crackle as its drying! VERY COOL, it looks great, gets alot of compliments and stays on for many days! highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This nail polish works just like it is suppossed to...it perfectly crackles within seconds of applying it.  The only reason people say this doesn&#x27;t work is because they didn&#x27;t let the base coat completely dry first, or they applied too much of the black shatter. The condition it came in was excellent...it looks like it is brand new, and I have gotten so many compliments!  The color is also perfect for light base colors, so you have a good contrast when putting black over it.  I did white underneath, and it looks awesome!  The shipping was also very fast...I received it right when it was scheduled to come!  This is definitely a great buy for anyone looking to try something new with their nails!!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is so cool. I wanna know how they make it. A little tip: if you put very little on it will make small patches of black and look more scattered. If you put more on, then it&#x27;ll make bigger patches of black, which is what I prefer. Overall, very cool. I want the silver shatter!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on in the middle of April. A month later, I noticed that the polish was getting very thick. I read other reviewers stating the same thing, but hey it still worked. It just made for bigger crackles on my nails. Well yesterday I opened my bottle to use it only to discover that it is now a solid black glob inside the bottle. I only used this stuff a few times, so how could it possibly become a solid block? I have never had a nail polish do this before! And OPI is held in such high regards as to quality. I am now leery about buying anymore OPI products. I have other crackle products, mostly by China Glaze, and they have never even begun to get thick. Maybe I had a bad batch.</li>
    <li> This definitely was not what I was expecting. It is very thick and dries quickly. So it is difficult to get a thin coat. Also base color is limited with this color as it is very black. Does need a top coat because it dries matte finish.</li>
    <li> Love the look.  Make sure you don&#x27;t do it too thick or it won&#x27;t crackle the right way.  The bottle dried up quicker than other nail polishes normally do though.</li>
    <li> Opi shatter polish is great!  Easy to put on and does what it is supposed to.  Gives your nails a fun look and I get tons of compliments.  You can use it with an array of colors.  Just be sure to let the color polish dry about 80% of the way and then apply the shatter.  You can put a top coat on after the shatter has dried.  I love it and have recommended it to everyone!  I now want them to make the shatter in other colors!</li>
    <li> Best when the bast coat is a light color (so no dark purple) and a very, very thin coat :) Great product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my bottle of Black Shatter, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It gives such a cool crackle effect on the nail. I found that if I applied it thinly, the cracks were thin, and at quick glance could be mistaken for a jacked up manicure. If I applied it a little thicker, the cracks were larger and more noticeable, exposing more of the base color through the cracks. A top coat is needed for shine, since the shatter polish drys to a matte finish. Using bright base colors under the shatter polish really makes it stand out. I suggest also topping off with a glitter polish for added bling!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend thinking it would be here within at least two weeks. It literally almost took 2 months to get this stupid bottle of nail polish. I emailed the seller wondering where my package was and never received a reply, all I got was an automated email saying my order had been canceled, then 5 days later it showed up.     Stuff works I guess though, the gf like it.</li>
    <li> Loved this black shatter OPI. Works well on top of any dried color coat. Makes my nails look as if they were done at the salon. :)</li>
    <li> This polish works just like it says.  Turns out very cool.  Lasts for over two weeks as of now without any showing of fading.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I am WAYYYYY too old to be wearing something with Katy Perry&#x27;s name on it, but really love this polish. Works as promised and is a fun look that is different without being overly dramatic, certainly not as much as some of the nail polishes I have worm throughout the years.    If you are looking for something different, give it a try. And be ready for some good comments!</li>
    <li> I purchased this and it did not work at all. I tried to return it and the company I purchased it from would not allow me to. Be careful who you buy this from. I would suggest buying it at the store to make sure it works so you can return if it does not.</li>
    <li> OPI is the best nail polish available and the shatter is so much fun! One thin coat applied to dried nail polish and it cracks instantly. So happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shatter nail polish.  It is a dark blue-black and it shatters when you put it over a solid nail enamel color, giving the effect of a distressed surface.  Depending on what color you put under it, the possibilities are endless!  This comes out as an flat finish though, so you definitely need to put on a clear coat or two.  AWESOME!  Love OPI!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this nail lacquer. It was exactly what I wanted and I do not have any complains.</li>
    <li> I was super excited when I first received this because I had been wanting to buy it for several months. And when I tried it out I fell in love with it immediately. Unfortunately, that only lasted a few uses. For some reason (I&#x27;ve had it about 2 weeks), it just doesn&#x27;t crack right anymore. It&#x27;s very goopy. And if you take more than one swipe to cover your whole nail, it will be thicker in the middle where you apply more than one coat. Also, if you mess up, you have to redo the entire nail (base coat and all).</li>
    <li> Long lasting and dries exactly as the product advertises, however dries just a little too quick... no time for 2 quick coats overlapping one another.</li>
    <li> I have Sally Hansen crackle polish from Walmart, and then I have this nail polish.  There is definitely a difference in quality.  It cracks perfectly, in all the right places, and hasn&#x27;t gotten goopy in storage like my Sally Hansen.</li>
    <li> I love the crackle nail polish. It&#x27;s easy to use and looks nice. The only thing with the opi shatter is that it seems to easily clump up and in turn is harder to apply.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work, but my daughter uses it and loves it.  Make sure your nail polish is completely dry before applying this, though.</li>
    <li> Would never buy this again....did not like it.  Didn&#x27;t look like I expected it to look. I tried it and threw it away.</li>
    <li> Bought this a while back when the crackle fad was pretty new. This product only lasted a few uses before it got really thick and clumpy and unusable. I have never had this problem with a polish before. It did work but seemed like it was old when I got it.</li>
    <li> I love how it shatters oh so perfectly every time I put it on top of my base. It dries quick, maybe too quick, but it&#x27;s not thick and lumpy so it works out. I just wish it was a little bit thicker since it dries so fast, it&#x27;s sometimes hard to get the desired look if you don&#x27;t put enough on. Anyways, it compliments any nail polish and gives your nails a WOW factor. &amp;#60;3 it!</li>
    <li> This is just great, love the effect after one coat, I will love to have more colors of this wonder</li>
    <li> Looks like crap over anything and it&#x27;s tough to get off. I won&#x27;t by buying another of these. It was a mistake.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. absolutely loving this item, and the price was absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;OPI Nail Lacquer BLACK SHATTER - Katy Perry Collection</li>
    <li> The first couple of times I used this, I loved it. After a few more times, though, the polish started to get goopy and thick. I eventually had to throw it away because it no longer had that cracked effect and was too thick to paint onto my nails. A waste of money for long term use.</li>
    <li> This stuff looks really cool with a nice base coat. I really thought it was cool to watch it dry and break apart.</li>
    <li> Bought for daughter off Christmas list. Was excited to get. Liked it so well has used it up.</li>
    <li> Worked great but remember to shake well and re-open frequently! It got stuck and I ended up having to chuck it in the end.</li>
    <li> My daughter was very happy with this OPI</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.. she said she likes it.  It looks neat when she wears it.  not sure how it works, nor do i care.</li>
    <li> love it and it came very fast</li>
    <li> dries to fast you cant keep it for more than 2months before it gets chunky and have to replace it</li>
    <li> I like the look of it but over time the polish got chunky and hard to apply. Not that i was an expert in applying it anyway, but the condition of it changing over time definitely affected my experience. At the time that I bought this, shatter nail polish had just come out and the town that I was living in was completely sold out everywhere so I bought it here online. Now that it&#x27;s been out a couple years, I&#x27;m sure you can find other brands and cheaper prices in many different colors to create your nail designs.</li>
    <li> This polish was bought as a gift when the stores did not carry it...works to the specifications, indeed.  Thanks OPI</li>
    <li> It is better than the Sally&#x27;s one. I love it. The cracking effect is really good. received it very fast, the package was of a good size and protected the product. no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> Love it! Want another!!! ❤️</li>
    <li> I use this during Halloween.  The shatter effect is really neat if you can get it right.  You only to one coat and the quicker the better.  If you can cover your whole nail in one sweep, that works the best.  If you have to make 2 strokes, the shatter effect is not as good.  It is a pain to take off but when I pair it with orange and get a good shatter effect, my nails look awesome and I get tons of compliments.</li>
