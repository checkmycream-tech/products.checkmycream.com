      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love Pureology products</li>

      <li>I love that It came quickly.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been lucky like that!</li>
      <li>and it dries looking totally fabulous with summery beach waves.  </li>
      <li>Nano Glaze is a fabulous product, this however is NOT Nano Glaze.  </li>
      <li>I have bought several Pureology products and wasn&#x27;t happy with ay of them.</li>
      <li>But after using the nano glaze, my hair looks better both wavy and straight with all the frizz virtually gone.</li>
      <li>Its my favorite product because it really works.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;ve never used this particular product, I&#x27;ve been using pureology loyally for many years.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years and love it!  </li>
      <li>I have very  fine hair and this offers just the right amount of body.</li>
      <li>It is great for putting a little polish on the &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>This product has actually been discontinued by the manufacturer so I was thrilled to find it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, and as long as I don&#x27;t use too much (more than a dime-size dollop is too much for most hair)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I only wish that I&#x27;d ordered more than one.  </li>
      <li>It is an excellent product and I am sad to see it discontinued.</li>
      <li>This is the only styling product I use any more.  </li>
      <li>I far prefer it to sprays and gels (which make my skin break out) and mousses, which I find too light.</li>
      <li>I saw that there were a few good reviews on this, and being a lover of Pureology products</li>
      <li>Comparing the bottle to other, salon purchased, pureology products I own, it couldn&#x27;t be more obvious.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s naturally wavy with super frizzy ends.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair and it takes forever to dry, but when I use this it cuts the drying time significantly!</li>
      <li>If you have very thick,dry,high-lighted hair</li>
      <li>Nano Glaze really does   </li>
      <li>I really like the product that I&#x27;m using now, but it doesn&#x27;t travel well on flights.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really care too much because ..</li>
      <li>and it is the only product that has ever work, also recomend the smooth cream and mix it together.</li>
      <li>this product just doesn&#x27;t do much .So</li>
      <li>I use about a quarter-size of product before blowing dry my very fine short hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing when you blow it dry or just leave it in to air dry.</li>
      <li>I have very thick, coarse hair that I&#x27;m working on getting healthy and this fakes that healthy look for me.</li>
      <li>This styling creme is well worth the extra cost.</li>
      <li>I also needed to style it with an iron (which actually helps frizz as those of you may know) in order for this to be effective (which was average effectiveness compared to using others on the market).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavey/ curly hair and a lot if the time it&#x27;s battling the weather and will frizz out!  </li>
      <li>Have tried many other products and always come back to Nano Glaze.</li>
      <li>You put nanoglaze on the hair while its wet and after blow drying your hair is super silky and the frizz is gone.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how shiny, straight -BUT NOT FLAT OR LIFELESS - and bouncy my hair</li>
      <li>I have shoulder-length straight, fine (but thick) hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and without any noticeable scent which I appreciate.  </li>
      <li>my hair&#x27;s soft and manageable and never greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on an neverending quest to find a replacement for the old formula of Bumble &amp; Bumble Styling Creme and believe I&#x27;ve succeeded.  </li>
      <li>I use this product to keep the frizz away and maintain a soft control on the waves/curls.</li>
      <li>It make my hair so soft and silky...</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft, and its not sticky or greasy in any way after using Nano Glaze.  </li>
      <li>Too bad L&#x27;Oreal tampered with the formulas for some Pureology products, such as the great shampoos.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is without a doubt a knock off.  The packaging is all off and the product itself is not as it should be.  Nano Glaze is a fabulous product, this however is NOT Nano Glaze.  I wouldn&#x27;t really care too much because .. I mean ... Let&#x27;s face it ... It&#x27;s hair gel ... BUT I paid over $30 for this bottle.  I have issue with paying salon prices for a Canal Street knock off.  Buyer beware!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for for year&#x27;s. I have curlly frizzy hair and it is the only product that has ever work, also recomend the smooth cream and mix it together.</li>
    <li> My hair is kind of wavy and has lots of frizz. You put nanoglaze on the hair while its wet and after blow drying your hair is super silky and the frizz is gone. I dont even round brush my hair with the blow dryer i just turn my head upside down and dry. Its my favorite product because it really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on an neverending quest to find a replacement for the old formula of Bumble &amp; Bumble Styling Creme and believe I&#x27;ve succeeded.  Somewhere I read that this was an alternative and I&#x27;ve just ordered my second bottle.  I use about a quarter-size of product before blowing dry my very fine short hair.  It holds the styling and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or stiff at all. Leaves my hair soft and without any noticeable scent which I appreciate.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My hair goes every which way when humidity hits it.  Nano Glaze really does   help keep it to a minimum.  My hair feels soft, and its not sticky or greasy in any way after using Nano Glaze.  The price is good.  The product was delivered timely and in good conditIon.  I only wish that I&#x27;d ordered more than one.  I will order from here again.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product. And this Amazon seller offered it for the cheapest out of any other site I checked.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but this stuff really is as good as everyone says. I&#x27;m not a big fan of Pureology&#x27;s other products, but this one gives me immediate results that nothing I&#x27;ve used comes close to. I have very thick, coarse hair that I&#x27;m working on getting healthy and this fakes that healthy look for me. It&#x27;s amazing when you blow it dry or just leave it in to air dry. My holy grail!</li>
    <li> My hair has always looked kind of blah- it&#x27;s naturally wavy with super frizzy ends. Even when I straighten it with my Chi it doesn&#x27;t look all that great.     But after using the nano glaze, my hair looks better both wavy and straight with all the frizz virtually gone. Plus it&#x27;s good for colored treated hair (which mine is).     Love this product.</li>
    <li> I saw that there were a few good reviews on this, and being a lover of Pureology products I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  I had been using Morrocan Oil that totally dried out my hair and left it dull and lifeless.  Weird I know.  So with this stuff I simply put a dab throughout my hair and let it air dry and it dries looking totally fabulous with summery beach waves.  I&#x27;ve also tried blow drying and gotten equally amazing results.  Within a week of use, my hair is already regaining it&#x27;s former luster.  Love it! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product as intended, but I think it&#x27;s great for what I do use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavey/ curly hair and a lot if the time it&#x27;s battling the weather and will frizz out!  I use this product to keep the frizz away and maintain a soft control on the waves/curls. It leaves my hair feeling as though there is no product at all, but does the job a product should!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product and a bottle lasts forever! To bad Pureology doesn&#x27;t make it anymore! Shipping was fast and product was wrapped very nicely.</li>
    <li> This is the only styling product I use any more.  It&#x27;s lightweight, and as long as I don&#x27;t use too much (more than a dime-size dollop is too much for most hair) my hair&#x27;s soft and manageable and never greasy.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I used this product for several years - until Pureology sold out to L&#x27;Oreal. I really like the product that I&#x27;m using now, but it doesn&#x27;t travel well on flights. (the change in air pressure causes the foam to go crazy) So I keep a bit of Nano Glaze on hand for traveling.  Too bad L&#x27;Oreal tampered with the formulas for some Pureology products, such as the great shampoos.</li>
    <li> IT IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS!!!!!! I&#x27;M A LICENSED COSMETOLOGIST &amp; HAVE USED IT IN THE PAST, NOT THE SAME!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have very  fine hair and this offers just the right amount of body. Have tried many other products and always come back to Nano Glaze.</li>
    <li> I wish this particular item in the line were not so hard to find. I have been using it for half a dozen years, since my hair stylist recommended it. I have shoulder-length straight, fine (but thick) hair. A small dab controls frizz and keeps hair out of my eyes if I apply it after drying. It also achieves these goals and protects hair from heat when applied before drying--with a bit softer hold. I far prefer it to sprays and gels (which make my skin break out) and mousses, which I find too light.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair. I have bought several Pureology products and wasn&#x27;t happy with ay of them. These products must be for people with hair that is in better condition than mine. If you have very thick,dry,high-lighted hair this product just doesn&#x27;t do much .So save your money!</li>
    <li> This styling creme is well worth the extra cost. The package arrived well packed.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing!!! I am 1/2 Native American and 1/2 Irish...my hair has always, ALWAYS been frizzy. No, not curly, not wavy...I couldn&#x27;t have been lucky like that! I have spent thousands upon thousands of dollars through my life (I&#x27;m 44) on anti-frizz/smoothing shampoos, conditioners, leave-in products and sprays...not to mention flat-irons, brushes, etc...you get it. I read the reviews on this product, ordered some, used 1 1/2 pumps (I have long hair) and distributed it evenly in my damp hair. I let my hair air dry and I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how shiny, straight -BUT NOT FLAT OR LIFELESS - and bouncy my hair was/is!!! I even blow dried it (with a diffuser) and DID NOT HAVE &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34; HAIR!!! OMG!! For the first time in my life, I have gorgeous hair!!!! Thank you Pureology!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading the 5 star \\&quot;stellar\\&quot; reviews. I have been looking for something to handle \\&quot;fly away &amp; frizz\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair wavy hair, medium length (2 inches past shoulders) that frizzes in the humidity of Florida. I used this product according to the directions, as well as other ways to see if I could get it to tame the frizzies. In the end, I found I needed to section off my hair &amp; use ALOT of the product (anywhere from 8- 12 squirts). I also needed to style it with an iron (which actually helps frizz as those of you may know) in order for this to be effective (which was average effectiveness compared to using others on the market).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, it seems for my type of hair (as well as length), this product does not work well. I may work best for people with short hair?</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It make my hair so soft and silky...it is very hard to find.  I love that It came quickly.</li>
    <li> I love Pureology products but this one is just &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; for my hair.  I found another Pureology product that I love more.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have a lot of hair and it takes forever to dry, but when I use this it cuts the drying time significantly!</li>
    <li> It is great for putting a little polish on the &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.  I guess it doesn&#x27;t have a great amount of firmness to it but I like that.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It works great on my very curly hair</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and love it!  Why did they discontinue it????</li>
    <li> Cannot find it in the stores anymore but Amazon has it every time. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product has actually been discontinued by the manufacturer so I was thrilled to find it. It is an excellent product and I am sad to see it discontinued.</li>
    <li> Favorite hair product!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve never used this particular product, I&#x27;ve been using pureology loyally for many years. This item is clearly fake. Comparing the bottle to other, salon purchased, pureology products I own, it couldn&#x27;t be more obvious. The font is off, the trademark marking is in the wrong place, eccetera. I haven&#x27;t used it, so I can&#x27;t attest to the quality of this imposter goo</li>
