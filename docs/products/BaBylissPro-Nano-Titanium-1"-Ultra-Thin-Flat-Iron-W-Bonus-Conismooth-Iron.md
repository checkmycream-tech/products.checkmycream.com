      <li>She says she can now do her hair quickly and the results are beautiful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the BaByliss for over a month, and I&#x27;m still super happy with it</li>
      <li>but this is by far the best one!!</li>
      <li>They are still going strong!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t blame it on my fine hair either, the plates should touch regardless or hair type!</li>
      <li>Thank u very much!!!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>Love it, I order this iron after reading reviews.</li>
      <li>This is my second Nano Titanium 1&amp;#34; &amp; it is the best I have ever used</li>
      <li>She loved mine so much she had to have her own.</li>
      <li>&amp; I have tried so many.</li>
      <li>OK</li>
      <li>The flat iron is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
      <li>But BaByliss flat irons are one of the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>that listed this as one of the best flat irons AND looked on youtube.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had both FHI and CHI flat irons and this one has worked the best out of all three.</li>
      <li>This is the best flat iron EVER!!!!</li>
      <li>Worth the money for sure!</li>
      <li>It works great so far.  </li>
      <li>ITs very good if you have long hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure over time I will get better with it, but I wasn&#x27;t really interested in getting a curling iron that has a learning curve.</li>
      <li>Basically, if you have fine hair... DONT BUY IT.</li>
      <li>, I have fine hair</li>
      <li>They make my hair smooth and straightens it well.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Lol but expect this one to last longer.</li>
      <li>The hair straightener will leave you hair shiny, and smooth.</li>
      <li>I did like the additional conismooth iron which creates some fabulous be achy curl styles.  </li>
      <li>It glides smoothly over the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull.  </li>
      <li>use the Vivitone Glare Smoothing Serum with the iron &amp; my below the shoulder hair stays smooth through 80% humidity</li>
      <li>I paid almost $100 for this thing that doesn&#x27;t even work as good as my old cheap Revlon that I paid $20 for.</li>
      <li>I will give one redeeming attribute to the fact that it does a nice curl, or curve, if you&#x27;re looking for more than just a flat end to your hair.</li>
      <li>So very worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see that the BaBylissPro Nano Titanium 1&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Works okay, wouldn&#x27;t buy again, it doesn&#x27;t glide as well as the Babyliss Pro with steam which I positively adore.</li>
      <li>and the curler makes perfect curls, its hard to begin with the curler you need practice.</li>
      <li>I loved both of these two irons as they performed to their overall expectations!</li>
      <li>Super quick to iron my hair.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly and straighten hair.</li>
      <li>The plates should touch when I hold it in the air and press, but only the VERY top portion does.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>The flat iron works amazingly well</li>
      <li>I have found other flat irons to be much better and have since gotten a different brand and been very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I received the iron only to find a huge gap between the plates!</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t seem to get a consistent look with it.  </li>
      <li>I have used many different brands</li>
      <li>I bought this one for my daughter after I had bought one for myself first.</li>
      <li>Both work well for me and were not fake like some of the reviews.  </li>
      <li>First of all, two for the price of one?</li>
      <li>Now seriously, I&#x27;m not a big complainer about products, I understand that nothing is perfect and you have to take the good with the bad--</li>
      <li>The conismooth works great on mine and my daughters thick hair.</li>
      <li>&amp; I know it is  coarser than before &amp; perhaps a bit more fragile, yet</li>
      <li>exactly what i hope for.</li>
      <li>It would become so hot that I could not touch anything but the handle when doing my hair.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE these flat irons.</li>
      <li>Love the flat iron and the conismooth iron.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with my flat iron!!!!</li>
      <li>of the big pluses of the iron is that it does not snag strands of hair but glides smoothly.</li>
      <li>The reason I am rating this a 4 instead of a 5 is because I haven&#x27;t had much use for the conismooth iron.</li>
      <li>I really hope that this review helps some of you, and that you might take this into consideration when thinking about buying this.</li>
      <li>I really like it  </li>
      <li>very sleek and efficient</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soo straight</li>
      <li>I have to have it on it&#x27;s highest setting to really get my hair straight</li>
      <li>so my hair always looks frizzy but after buying this product its straight as can be and really shiny...</li>
      <li>She likes it better than all the other brands she has had.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it, I haven&#x27;t used the curling iron, so I don&#x27;t have much to say about it.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t like to set the heat too high.</li>
      <li>I think that the product works well, but not necessarily better than any other good ironing comb.  </li>
      <li>So I was pretty excited to get this since my last one crapped out a few days prior.</li>
      <li>but I thought that maybe I didn&#x27;t have the heat set up high enough</li>
      <li>(I have very thick, very curly hair), and the extra wand makes some really cute curls.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought these for my wife.  She loves them, her hair looks beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron EVER!!!! I have used many different brands but this is by far the best one!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work properly.  One of the pair doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.  Had to throw in the trash.</li>
    <li> I only write a review for one of two reasons... it&#x27;s an extremely good thing and I think everyone needs to know about it... or, it&#x27;s an extremely bad thing and I think everyone needs to know about it. This is one of those bad ones! I bought this because of all the great reviews, i even read elsewhere online that listed this as one of the best flat irons AND looked on youtube. Needless to say I don&#x27;t buy things without first looking into them. So I was pretty excited to get this since my last one crapped out a few days prior. I got this in the mail in record time-- Amazon Prime-- and I used it the next day. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed but I thought that maybe I didn&#x27;t have the heat set up high enough, I have fine hair and I don&#x27;t like to set the heat too high. So the next day I used it I set the heat up higher, not impressed AGAIN. OK so here&#x27;s my problem with it; the plates don&#x27;t touch! It&#x27;s not the heat, and too be honest with you I don&#x27;t blame it on my fine hair either, the plates should touch regardless or hair type! The plates should touch when I hold it in the air and press, but only the VERY top portion does. Now tell me... how is that supposed to flat iron someones hair?!?!  I suppose it you have really thick hair it will, but again, that is not the point because they SHOULD touch. The real reason that I&#x27;m not happy about this is because of the price! I paid almost $100 for this thing that doesn&#x27;t even work as good as my old cheap Revlon that I paid $20 for. THAT, my friends, it bullish*t. Now seriously, I&#x27;m not a big complainer about products, I understand that nothing is perfect and you have to take the good with the bad-- I often think that a lot of reviews are people being over critical on every little aspect-- but this time I am really not happy with this product or the price they are actually charging people for it! Another thing, since I&#x27;m listing things, the cord is too long. Why do I need a 9 foot cord?!? I have no idea but it&#x27;s not necessary and it makesit a pain to store it away. I will give one redeeming attribute to the fact that it does a nice curl, or curve, if you&#x27;re looking for more than just a flat end to your hair. I&#x27;m going to post a picture that shows just how little of the plates actually do touch. I really hope that this review helps some of you, and that you might take this into consideration when thinking about buying this. Basically, if you have fine hair... DONT BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had both FHI and CHI flat irons and this one has worked the best out of all three. I have a LOT of hair that isn&#x27;t really thick but has a natural wave/curl that is a pain to keep straight.  The babyliss actually keeps the annoying fly aways at my temples at bay.  It heats up to the 400 within a minute or so.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago! They are still going strong!</li>
    <li> Works okay, wouldn&#x27;t buy again, it doesn&#x27;t glide as well as the Babyliss Pro with steam which I positively adore.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair that can easily make me look like an extra on the set of Young Frankenstein in Florida&#x27;s humidity. This is my second Nano Titanium 1&amp;#34; &amp; it is the best I have ever used &amp; I have tried so many. I have not yet tried the bonus Conismooth Iron, so that remains a mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Vivitone Glare Smoothing Serum with the iron &amp; my below the shoulder hair stays smooth through 80% humidity days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the big pluses of the iron is that it does not snag strands of hair but glides smoothly. I have let my hair go grey &amp; I know it is  coarser than before &amp; perhaps a bit more fragile, yet it does not leave my hair dry and brittle. 5 stars all the way!</li>
    <li> I returned this.  It would become so hot that I could not touch anything but the handle when doing my hair.  I have found other flat irons to be much better and have since gotten a different brand and been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love it! First of all, two for the price of one? Sold. The flat iron works amazingly well (I have very thick, very curly hair), and the extra wand makes some really cute curls. I&#x27;d like to say you could straighten with the wand, too, but I couldn&#x27;t--maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type. So very worth every penny. Until now, I had been solely a CHI user. But I&#x27;ve had three break in as many years with no good reason. I&#x27;ve had the BaByliss for over a month, and I&#x27;m still super happy with it</li>
    <li> I went to my stylist and she had the same straightner! She recommended it awhile back. Couldnt afford it then. Really expensive compared to walmart. Lol but expect this one to last longer.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these flat irons. They make my hair smooth and straightens it well. I would recommend them to anyone.  My only criticism is that the paint comes of after a few uses.  Other than that I love them.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why people are not saying its not a great product cause if is...I really love it! I live in Dallas and the humidity here is bad so my hair always looks frizzy but after buying this product its straight as can be and really shiny...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my flat iron!!!! Great product and I have had no issues with the product.  Its exactly what i hope for. Thank u very much!!!</li>
    <li> love it curls come out perfect... my friends are jealous!!!</li>
    <li> I liked this straightener because it works well with my 4A/4B hair. But I wish it was digital thermostat. But it definitely does it job. I have yet to try the curler yet but I hope it works as well as the straightener.</li>
    <li> I think that the product works well, but not necessarily better than any other good ironing comb.  I did like the additional conismooth iron which creates some fabulous be achy curl styles.  Both work well for me and were not fake like some of the reviews.  I think it is a game of luck an chance.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  Its the one the Salon uses &amp; she loves it.  It works great so far.  Been only about a month.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  She says she can now do her hair quickly and the results are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love it! 2 great styling products in one box. The hair straightener will leave you hair shiny, and smooth. Highly recommend it, I haven&#x27;t used the curling iron, so I don&#x27;t have much to say about it.</li>
    <li> yes i am very happy with my, Babybliss ProNana that i got it at a gteat dill thanks. MatyJane</li>
    <li> Love it. Must buy it!!! very sleek and efficient</li>
    <li> I was excited to see that the BaBylissPro Nano Titanium 1&amp;#34; Ultra Thin Flat Iron came with a Conismooth Iron.  Getting the 2 for 1 deal saved at least $35-40.  The flat iron is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It glides smoothly over the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull.  The curling iron is a little difficult to use.  I like the concept of all the different curls and waves this type of iron can do but I can&#x27;t seem to get a consistent look with it.  I&#x27;m sure over time I will get better with it, but I wasn&#x27;t really interested in getting a curling iron that has a learning curve.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! That is the flat iron. The reason I am rating this a 4 instead of a 5 is because I haven&#x27;t had much use for the conismooth iron. But BaByliss flat irons are one of the best I have ever used. I prefer it to Chi.</li>
    <li> I thought that after reading the negative and positive reviews that this would be worth the price. WRONG! I received the iron only to find a huge gap between the plates! Looks to be similar problems with other photos in regards to this flat iron. Not ok for $129</li>
    <li> excellent product recommend</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this I have to have it on it&#x27;s highest setting to really get my hair straight and I&#x27;ve been burned by it several times.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair soo straight and the curler makes perfect curls, its hard to begin with the curler you need practice. ITs very good if you have long hair</li>
    <li> It decided to quit turning on after only 5 months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lighter than the 1 1/12 &amp;#34; BaByliss I had before and I love it! I thought it would be harder to do my hair since it is smaller and I have long hair but it is not! Not at all!</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron and the conismooth iron. The conismooth works great on mine and my daughters thick hair. Th curls stay in all day!</li>
    <li> I love it! Heats up quickly and straighten hair. Leaves hair silky and smooth.  Great  Flat Iron for the cost.</li>
    <li> It takes me less than 10 minutes to straighten my hair. Worth the money for sure!</li>
    <li> Theis was recommended to my daughter by her hair stylist.  She likes it better than all the other brands she has had.</li>
    <li> Love it, I order this iron after reading reviews. I really like it  it leaves my hair shiny and very straighten half the time my only complaint is that the plates feel very hot on the outside it doesn&#x27;t have a protector for my fingers to hold on while ironing</li>
    <li> Salon quality styling. I get compliments on my hair all of the time. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!! I bought this one for my daughter after I had bought one for myself first. She loved mine so much she had to have her own.</li>
    <li> Love them! Super quick to iron my hair.</li>
    <li> This item was excellent compared to their curling iron brand, which sucked, but worked ok. I loved both of these two irons as they performed to their overall expectations! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Best straightener ever!  And the best price I&#x27;ve seen around!</li>
    <li> The product was good, but lately the shipping is having a really bad image for you guys as Amazon company!</li>
