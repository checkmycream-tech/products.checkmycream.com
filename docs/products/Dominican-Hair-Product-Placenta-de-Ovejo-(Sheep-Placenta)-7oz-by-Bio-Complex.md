      <li>I am looking for a new product that gives me the same results I used to get with this product.</li>
      <li>This formula is like putting a bottle of miracle in your hair, I believe this product is for all hair type especially after a shampoo, My hair felt silky soft and alive.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to bring back life to dull dry hair and those edges loss from braids and tight weaves.</li>
      <li>The smell is different and it no longer leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>It left my hair so soft.</li>

<li> For anyone with dry and/or damaged hair, highly recommended.</li>
<li> Normally with this much growth I would have a hard time.</li>
<li> It does wonders in the area of breakage and provides body and leaves your hair soft without the frizziness and definitely doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>

<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> Only need a small amount each day and hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy, it doesn&#x27;t build up either.</li>
<li> Since I previously had sucess with other products I figured it might work well because of the placenta in it.</li>
<li> it will weigh it down.  </li>
<li> I found the product to be heavy</li>

<li> It&#x27;s not to heavy on your hair.</li>
<li> I am not sure what benefit I&#x27;ve received from using this product.  </li>
<li> I apply a small amount as soon as I get out of the shower</li>
<li> my highlights don&#x27;t look dull anymore.</li>
<li> and I have a thick head of hair.  </li>
<li> 4c thick hair.</li>
<li> seriously zero result...</li>
<li> sorry.</li>
<li> , this conditioner is not the same, smells bad, it hurts my eyes when I apply it on my hair, I just don&#x27;t like it anymore!!!</li>
<li> Too bad..</li>
<li> I am so disappointed.</li>

    <li> I love this product . It takes away frizz without weighing down&lt;br /&gt;my hair, leaves hair soft and  shinny . I use it on wet and dry hair, but I think&lt;br /&gt;it works best on dry hair from root to end.</li>
    <li> Quck shipping! I love this product, I&#x27;ve used it off and on for years. It does wonders in the area of breakage and provides body and leaves your hair soft without the frizziness and definitely doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this product.  I buy them and sednd to my aunt in London.  All the same I have been using this product for over 5 years and i am in my 40&#x27;s and I have a thick head of hair.  I will continue to use this!  love it!</li>
    <li> I have finally found a leave in that keeps my hair from frizzing in humidity. I love how it makes my hair feel so soft and bouncy! I swear it gives my hair shine and my highlights don&#x27;t look dull anymore. I didn&#x27;t buy from amazon because I found it for a better price on a Dominican hair site.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to bring back life to dull dry hair and those edges loss from braids and tight weaves.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, color treated, dry, natural curly hair with lots of breakage. I have only used this product once so far but the results are amazing.  My hair is so soft and shiny.  I can&#x27;t stop playing with my hair!!!!  I&#x27;m pretty excited about this product.</li>
    <li> Oh dear.. I used to buy this regularly, and LOVED the smell...clean and fresh, and made my thick, curly hair so soft! But they must  have changed the formula, because this last bottle I bought smells so foul (like hair coloring developer), that I am just going to have to throw it out.  Too bad..it was such a great leave in -- but the odor is so strong, it makes me feel ill.</li>
    <li> Love this products. Makes hair feel so soft. And very moisturized. Will buy again. And there is a lot in it, so it will more than a month.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for my hair</li>
    <li> I have used this product for nearly 20 years. My hair is strong, long and healthy. However, in the last few months this product changed. The smell is different and it no longer leaves my hair shiny and soft. I am so disappointed. I am looking for a new product that gives me the same results I used to get with this product. I don&#x27;t know if anyone has had the same experience with this product. Please let me know.</li>
    <li> I apply a small amount as soon as I get out of the shower and it makes my hair super soft and way easier to manage.</li>
    <li> This formula is like putting a bottle of miracle in your hair, I believe this product is for all hair type especially after a shampoo, My hair felt silky soft and alive.</li>
    <li> Always makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Works for me n jus 1 application. And has a lovely smell.</li>
    <li> I have extremely coarse (if you&#x27;re into hair typing) 4c thick hair. I applies this to my hair after washing and it was soooo soft. I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my head and I was surprised to not hear the familiar crunchiness that my hair usually does. I&#x27;m about to buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> I used this product after a roller set. I found the product to be heavy and it made my hair limp. I would recommend this product for someone who has really dry hair.</li>
    <li> seriously zero result... I purchased because of great reviews and starting to think its all false, i have seen nil result whatsoever, don&#x27;t throw your money away</li>
    <li> For anyone with dry and/or damaged hair, highly recommended. Only need a small amount each day and hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy, it doesn&#x27;t build up either.</li>
    <li> I used this right before I put my rollers in. When I took the rollers out my hair was soft and bouncy. And it seems like after each use my hair gets softer and softer. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am not sure what benefit I&#x27;ve received from using this product.  Nothing significant to report at this juncture, sorry ;&amp;#62;(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened with this product, i&#x27;ve been ordering this for a long time, my last order, this conditioner is not the same, smells bad, it hurts my eyes when I apply it on my hair, I just don&#x27;t like it anymore!!! sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I recently paid 125.00 to get my hair multi-tinted and cut. I have some natural curl in my hair and, since I am nearly 60, I bought this to see if it would restore the resiliency, softness and shine to my hair. I am here to tell you it did all three! If you want soft, bouncy, shiny, young hair again buy this! It doesn&#x27;t take a lot just a quarter size in your palm and rub your hands and then smooth it all over your hair after shampooing. Don&#x27;t use a cream rinse just use this and you don&#x27;t have to rinse it out either.</li>
    <li> I am an admitted product junkie. I have tried every hair product under the sun. Let me tell you, this product will exceed you expectations. It left my hair so soft. To date, there has been NOTHING that have made such a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> So far so good.. The product smells very nice.  It&#x27;s not to heavy on your hair. You should try it.</li>
    <li> I have been on my hair journey for a couple of months. I would have to say this product is in my top 3. My hair is generally coarse and dry. It seemed like no matter what leave in i would use, it would work for awhile, but I would be back where I started. I did some research about Dominican products. Since I previously had sucess with other products I figured it might work well because of the placenta in it. I was right! This is a wonderful product! I am 3 months post texlax and in some places i have over 2 inches of new growth. Normally with this much growth I would have a hard time. This product makes my hair soooo soft I have to keep my hair braided to keep from manipulating my hair. I can barely stop touching it lol. This product also smells great. I would definitely recommend this to friends, which I already have.</li>
    <li> Love it ... made my hair feel so soft and look so shiny. A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t put too much on your hair,  it will weigh it down.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the vials. This product has my hair air dry with a healthy shine. I like to reiterate this isn&#x27;t going to grow your hair. This is to help you have healthy and strong hair which ultimately will allow you to retain length. You diet and how gentle you are with her hair is the other factor to having healthy and long hair. If you don&#x27;t care about having long hair then just know that your hair will be healthy. This works well with my hair regiment.</li>
