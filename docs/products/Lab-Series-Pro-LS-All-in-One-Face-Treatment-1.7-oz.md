      <li>It is very light and although it does state it contains a mattifier it doesn&#x27;t go in chalky</li>
      <li>Absolutely love how it makes my face feel.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll make sure to use this during the summer months to see if there is any update.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>This stuff is phenomenal.  </li>
      <li>As a man, this is truly one of my favorite products to use 365 days of the year.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff for my oily face.</li>
      <li>I am not so sure.</li>
      <li>bought this product on Macy&#x27;s for a much better bargain.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best when used with the blue after shave liquid.</li>
      <li>, it works well, non greasy and plus you can use it for lube if your ever in a pinch :)</li>
      <li>It glides on easily and has a nice smooth texture.</li>
      <li>and I sure did notice a huge difference when i used it.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes, tightens up your skin, generally does a great job.</li>
      <li>and I have also noticed fine lines around my eyes beginning to fade.</li>
      <li>Goes on light, absorbs well, nongreasy, and works with with a multitude of skin types.</li>
      <li>Light and you don&#x27;t need a lot for your face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, it is absorbed quickly and easily and doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
      <li>Overall a very nice men&#x27;s skin product that I can recommend.</li>
      <li>I do noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; greasy even if I am shiny-this still helps my face feel clean all day.</li>
      <li>I was right!</li>
      <li>and it works for many things , highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
      <li>and so far am pleased.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
      <li>In my mind well worth it.</li>
      <li>Thought that this would be better than it is, especially given the price.</li>
      <li>My favorite daytime moisturizer and the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy and shiny during the day.  </li>
      <li>It goes one easily, is not greasy, and my face looks good.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t look real metro or like a pretty boy</li>
      <li>and it is exactly plus more than what I expected.</li>
      <li>$30 is not expensive for a high quality moisurizer that delivers on its promises and lasts quite a while.</li>
      <li>It takes two applications to see any real difference.</li>
      <li>; so I figured it would be non-greasy, non-smelly and work really well.</li>
      <li>I use two pumps for my whole face.</li>
      <li>Really really helped my skin post-shaving.  </li>
      <li>Also I do not see any real difference from the Lab Series 15 SPF moisturizer, since that is cheaper per ounce</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I live in Miami so humidity and heat are always extremely high.</li>
      <li>but I have been using for YEARS and refuse to try something new.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a clean look and has made my chin and neck a whole lot less irritated.</li>
      <li>but it is ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  </li>
      <li>fast effects as i expected, no burns, very fast abssorption .</li>
      <li>I definitely can tell that it mattes my face very noticeably.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a while now and as someone with very sensitive skin especially while shaving this product has reduced acne and skin irritation to just about nothing.</li>
      <li>I am sure you can get the same results with less cost with other products in the market.</li>
      <li>Quick absorbing, leaves behind an even skin tone.</li>

<li> (Face is oily or dry at different parts of the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Kind of expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Im new to this facial treatment game, but I&#x27;ve tried samples of Clinique men broad spectrum, anti-aging, and others.</li>
<li> Before, my face was cracked, oily (shiny) and itchy from how dry it was.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have overly dry skin</li>
<li> and I need to use a lot of this product before the dry feeling goes away.</li>
<li> I also use various other repairing and anti-wrinkle serums at night so its hard to tell if this one has an effect since I wake up generally with a wrinkle-free face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> After using for just a few weeks, I was complimented by several individuals on the clarity and smoothness of the skin on my face and I&#x27;ve never stopped using it since.</li>
<li> Provided I shave carefully and wash my face</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over-use it.</li>
<li> In 5 or 6 hours I am a little shiny but in the humid South Florida heat I have never found a product that could matte my face all day long.</li>
<li> Not a favorite for my dry skin.</li>
<li> My only real complaint is that the oil-control seems a bit too aggressive for my skin-type which tends to be on the dry side.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive but a little also goes a long way.  </li>
<li> This could have something to do with the cold air of winter with which I am currently using it</li>
<li> I am confused with all the goop they say you need.  </li>

    <li> I love this stuff for my oily face. I will purchase it again. I just wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Excellent face treatment. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your face incredibly sticky and doesn&#x27;t cause acne.</li>

    <li> fast effects as i expected, no burns, very fast abssorption . I use it every morning, and it seems abundant</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be a really good cream whereby I would see a difference but it is ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  Lab Series used to make a moisturizer with blue reflectors, I wish they would make that cream again, it was for men and I sure did notice a huge difference when i used it.  That product is not discontinued.</li>
    <li> works well, and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have overly dry skin and I need to use a lot of this product before the dry feeling goes away. Also I do not see any real difference from the Lab Series 15 SPF moisturizer, since that is cheaper per ounce I would just buy that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about a month now and so far am pleased. It goes one easily, is not greasy, and my face looks good. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over-use it. My only real complaint is that the oil-control seems a bit too aggressive for my skin-type which tends to be on the dry side. This could have something to do with the cold air of winter with which I am currently using it so I&#x27;ll make sure to use this during the summer months to see if there is any update. Overall a very nice men&#x27;s skin product that I can recommend.</li>
    <li> Quick absorbing, leaves behind an even skin tone.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. Simplicity for men, just one time a day and it works for many things , highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff at Ulta on a whim because I wanted a good moisturizer. This product is solid. Light and you don&#x27;t need a lot for your face. Face feels good and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Love it</li>
    <li> great product and great value!</li>

    <li> Great product!  My favorite daytime moisturizer and the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy and shiny during the day.  A bit pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> A great product for men.</li>
    <li> Men.  Get your face on.  I am confused with all the goop they say you need.  You don&#x27;t. You just need this.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> Amazing face moisturizer. .</li>
    <li> l like this very good</li>
    <li> This stuff is phenomenal.  Really really helped my skin post-shaving.  Greatly reduced the amount of ingrown hairs I&#x27;d get on my neck and helped rehydrate my skin.  It&#x27;s expensive but a little also goes a long way.  In my mind well worth it.</li>
    <li> this stuff rocks, it works well, non greasy and plus you can use it for lube if your ever in a pinch :)</li>
    <li> Not a favorite for my dry skin. It takes two applications to see any real difference.</li>

    <li> Kind of expensive, but a little goes a long way. I also use the lab series shaving oil (which I would also recommend). The face treatment is a perfect way to end a shave and start a day. It moisturizes, tightens up your skin, generally does a great job.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love how it makes my face feel. I&#x27;ve used it two days and it is exactly plus more than what I expected. Could not find a product for my face that I loved before now. It does all day oil control plus smooths skin. Would definitely recommend to anybody.  Thank you lab series.</li>
    <li> great moisture control</li>
    <li> I live in Miami so humidity and heat are always extremely high. I want to moisturize my face but I need a moisturizer that won&#x27;t leave my face greasy or shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works perfectly. It glides on easily and has a nice smooth texture. I definitely can tell that it mattes my face very noticeably. In 5 or 6 hours I am a little shiny but in the humid South Florida heat I have never found a product that could matte my face all day long. This product is ideal for people who want an effective moisturizer without the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding repairing and soothing claims I am not so sure. I don&#x27;t use this as an aftershave balm so I cannot judge its soothing qualities. I also use various other repairing and anti-wrinkle serums at night so its hard to tell if this one has an effect since I wake up generally with a wrinkle-free face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go buy this! $30 is not expensive for a high quality moisurizer that delivers on its promises and lasts quite a while. I use two pumps for my whole face.</li>
    <li> Just started using this a week ago to combat redness. It has begun. Working already and I have also noticed fine lines around my eyes beginning to fade. It is very light and although it does state it contains a mattifier it doesn&#x27;t go in chalky but it also doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would hope. I do noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; greasy even if I am shiny-this still helps my face feel clean all day.</li>
    <li> Im new to this facial treatment game, but I&#x27;ve tried samples of Clinique men broad spectrum, anti-aging, and others. Nothing compares to this All-in-one Lab series face cream. Before, my face was cracked, oily (shiny) and itchy from how dry it was. (Face is oily or dry at different parts of the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product on Macy&#x27;s for a much better bargain. (For all you complaining about the price) alright fellas, happy shopping.</li>
