<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells good and does what it&#x27;s suppose too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of Vitamin C and truly believe that Vitamin C is great for keeping healthy, young-looking skin. With time and everyday use, this serum will help diminish signs of aging. With 25% Vitamin C, 20% Hyaluronic Acid, Alpha Arbutin, CoQ10 &amp; Niacinamide B3, all these are key ingredients in maintaining a vibrant and even toned skin. I use it twice a day, morning and night. It has a very nice citrus scent that is very invigorating. Don&#x27;t let the orange color alarm you. It will disappear once applied and leave a fresh, non-greasy feeling. I purchased this product at a promotional price to product test. Again, I&#x27;m an avid user of Vitamin C and believe in all it&#x27;s benefits. For me, this was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face with dermarolling and I&#x27;m noticing that my dark spots are getting less noticable and my skin looks more smoothed out.  I am not sure if it&#x27;s more a result of the dermarolling or this serum or if they are working together but I am noticing a real difference.</li>
    <li> My face look healthy, also you face coming to be more shine healthy look good</li>
    <li> re: Vitamin C Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;10% Glycolic Acid Cream&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Skin Bfightneing Serum&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great line of products. I created my own routine with them and it&#x27;s working out great. Look forward to sampling other items. I used the Vitamin C Cleanser twice a day; morning and night. It left my face really light and moisteurized. The lather is quite leathery so it does not drip so I also used it as a five minute mask. I added some 100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil when using it as a mask for a deep cleanse/conditioning. The jojoba oil has a trace of scent; some companies remove the scent completely, but it&#x27;s good it smells some, that way I know what jojoba smells like, or kind of, since I&#x27;ve never seen jojobas up close. Also, it worked really well as a hot oil treatment to prepare the skin for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about the orange color of the 10% Glycolic Acid Cream, until I read the &amp;#34;tips and directions&amp;#34; email, which stated that&#x27;s the color it&#x27;s supposed to be. my concern was I didn&#x27;t wanna look like I got a fake tan. Then I read the part about the sun exposure, at which point I decided to rinse it out after ten minutes. Its absorbed quickly and the orange does go away. This cream is great because it&#x27;s not too heavy when applied, and even after rinsing it out my skin felt moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Anytime I see &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; on a product I think of the crazy celebrities that bleach their skin to truly ugly and quickly noticeable results, that act like they look great and nothing&#x27;s wrong. So I approached the &amp;#34;Skin Brightening&amp;#34; line: Scrub, Serum, and Lotion with care and made sure to read the instructions and suggestions prior to use. The Skin Brightening Scrub I used twice a week, and the Skin Brightening Serum and the Skin Britghtening Lotion every other day, twice a day. because I have recurring acne I found the scrub a bit strong, though it does have a pleasant citrus scent, as does the serum. The lotion also has a trace of citrus scent. In combination, I found the line to help recede the acne noticeably after each use. As I never used a serum before I wonder if the filmsy texture after it dries is a natural occurance of using a serum? Or did I use too much? a little goes a long way on the lotion: the first few times I used way too much, now I use it one pump at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Since I got each of these products for review at a $1 each, I&#x27;d imagine that paying the full retail value would run quite steep, also considering I am used to pharmacy brand and Neutrogena products. For the time I&#x27;ve been using them, I did find these to work really well for me. it could be that my face had hit a &amp;#34;product plateau&amp;#34; and using new ones gave it a little something extra? Overall keep up the good work on these products, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.</li>
    <li> Being Hispanic I had some uneven skin tone due to pregnancy mask discoloration. Using this product has improved the even tone/color of my face.</li>
    <li> I thinks i have to wait and see a while and give a chance this product how it does to my face.</li>
    <li> Wow! I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this stuff Is. It has made my face so soft and smooth. It moisturizers and is making my fine lines seem softer. It is making my skin so much brighter and glowing looking. It is evening out my skin tone and it smells awesome just like oranges! This is a great product. Makes my face feel so refreshed and energized. It has so many great benefits.</li>
    <li> This is a product I do not use everyday. I noticed on myself after I used it my skin got lighter. Which is what it is suppose to do. If I used it everyday then my currently foundation shade would not match. I use this personally two to three times a week. Normally after I am using their mask. I feel my skin is looking healthier from using this product. It will warn you is comes out looking and smelling like a fruit drink. I also noticed when applying this to my skin it had a orange cast. That is just when you put it on. Here is my suggestion after using this product for more than two weeks. To do this at night. If you do this during the day you might see a little of the orange cast. I would also suggest to make sure you follow up with a good moisturizer. I can say it does take me three quarters to full dropper full. Now if I go to my neck I might need some more. If you are someone who has more mature or skin damage skin this would be a good option for you to use. I am pale skin and I can say if I did this more than two nights in a row. It is a big differences in skin color. I am loving how smooth my skin feels from using this product. I will continue to use this after I have done the mask. As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and really makes my skin feel and look good.  I really like this companies products.  Well worth the try.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. Your skin looks and feels incredible after each use. It delivers as promised.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells really good.  Like Oranges.&lt;br /&gt;-Has a high percentage of vitamin C. More than most all vit c serums I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;-A good list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The serum is orange so you can&#x27;t tell when the vitamin C has oxidized&lt;br /&gt;-Made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal to dry skin and dont typically break out on my cheeks but after using this for a couple days I started to get a bunch of really tiny bumps all over my cheeks making it feel a little sand papery so that was disappointing. The first couple days it made my skin really soft and smooth so I dont know if I&#x27;m just sensitive to one of the ingredients and if it would have gone away with continued use as my skin acclimates to it but I have a wedding to attend coming up so I&#x27;m not willing to find out especially if it ends up getting worse.  I may try to power through after the event and see how it goes.  I&#x27;ll update my review if I do.  Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot since it seems like most people seem to like it.  The biggest reason I wanted to buy it was the high percentage of vitamin C. I dont think I&#x27;ve seen any higher than 25%.  I like to split vitamin c serums into two smaller dark colored bottles and store in the fridge using up one bottle at a time as vit c is easily oxidized by light and heat.  And I&#x27;d especially suggest doing this with this stuff since it&#x27;s not clear so you can&#x27;t see when the vitamin c oxidizes and turns yellow.  I&#x27;ve used and like a lot of their other products but this one didn&#x27;t sit well with my skin.  YMMV</li>
    <li> Works as needed, thank you!</li>
    <li> I look young using this.</li>
    <li> Smells like clementines. I love it. Works beautifully on my face so far.</li>
    <li> Resulted in terrible acne on my face</li>
    <li> I love all of there products they work amazingly well and this company has the best customer service of any company I&#x27;ve ever dealt with you can really reach out to them and they respond promptly :: I love their b3 serum</li>
    <li> Nice tightening and is fading a darkk spot.</li>
    <li> This serum is light and non-irritating. I have sensitive skin and this serum doesn&#x27;t cause any problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;The clarity of my skin is noticeably more clear while using this product.</li>
    <li> Returned it. This product is awful.</li>
    <li> Horrible...I got a massive breakout of whiteheads all over my face after a few days of use. It also made my skin extra sensitive which made it painful just washing my face. I don&#x27;t know if the serum is too strong for my skin or what but I have since stopped using it for a week now and my face is slowly clearing up.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin. Not sure of a difference in brightness yet but my skin feels smoother,</li>
    <li> I love serums with vitamin c. They make my face feel very smooth</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way this makes me skin feel. Especially living in Florida. It makes my face feel sticky. I have noticed that my skin is looking great though so it is a nice a product. I changed the head to a spray nozzle though. I feel like it goes on nicer.</li>
    <li> I did not want to review this until it had time to work. So far, so good. I am a sucker for serums that will make me look younger. I am not sure I look younger, but my skin feels lots better. Does not make my skin break out like so many creams do. This feels light and seems to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; into my face- don&#x27;t look greasy or shiny. Just soft. I will buy it again but it seems to last a long time since you use so little.</li>
    <li> Bright Orange with barely any scent - this serum absorbs quickly into the skin and reduces dark spots on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this face serum. It  work better  for than than the regular Vitamin  C serum  in the summer time. My face has a  nice glow the next morning. &amp;#60; I only use at night&amp;#62;  . I have sensitive skin, but this work really  well for me. Will  definitely  buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a chance to try this with a  discount  price. My opinion is all  honest. This is a great  serum.</li>
    <li> I suffer with uneven and hyper-pigmented skin. After using this skin brightening serum religiously, I&#x27;ve seen my skin start to even out and I&#x27;ve even developed a glow!  This serum provides antioxidant protection against free radical damage and features remarkable skin lightening agents, as well as a potent moisturizer to help reduce fine lines and wrinkles for smooth and supple skin.&lt;br /&gt;This serum also helps repair rough, dry, wrinkled, blotchy and sun damaged skin to keep the face looking soft and healthy.  It has definitely helped mine feel softer and more supple.</li>
    <li> Not crazy with this product. For some reason this stuff has caused pimples. I use their other serum vitamin C and really like that better.</li>
    <li> Uhhh...i dont se anything different in my face but it smells good.</li>
    <li> Nice serum. Absorbs fast. Has a nice smell and leaves your skin looking smoother. Contains a lot of active ingredients.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. very casy to use , i honesty was afraid to use (ive had some serums burn me in the past) but this stuff works great</li>
    <li> Best customer services.&lt;br /&gt;The serum smells good, observes quickly on my skin and even my skin tone and make it glows. They say it will take about 2 months to really notice the skin lightening and really care about their product quality as well as customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product!! I only been using InstaNatural Skin Brightening for about two weeks and I can tell the difference already!!  I use it under my chin and neck. I use hair removal cream under my chin and neck and it has darken my skin. But InstaNatural Skin Brightening has brighten my skin!!! I&#x27;m loving the  change in my complexion!!</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin c face serum.  Moisturizes as it does it&#x27;s thing!  Thanks!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> A great addition to my skincare routine with other brightening items. I&#x27;ve seen some minimal results but also seen lots of benefits from the vitamin c. Highly recommend this serum!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a week, I love how it feels on my skin and how it leaves a glow to my skin and as for my melasma well I will continue to use and see how that goes.</li>
    <li> took a week to begin to see results after 2 weeks I can see it does</li>
    <li> I purchased this brightening serum with a discount, and was asked to submit a review after testing it out. I tested it out on my face, focusing on an area of dark spots on my upper left cheek (sun damage from driving without tinted glass, perhaps?). I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks now, having incorporated this product in my routine with multiple other moisturizing and skincare products (I love doing the Korean approach--my skin texture has improved so much, but that&#x27;s an aside). I&#x27;ve been applying this serum over my entire face in a thin layer, and then additionally massaging it into my dark spots for about 20 seconds. I have to say that the spots are fading indeed. The shape/area of darkness has not changed, but the overall darkness of this patch of skin is lighter now, with some more pronounced lightening toward the edges of the spot(s). I guess with lengthier use, they will continue to fade.&lt;br /&gt;What I also enjoy about this product is that it contains hyaluronic acid and vitamin C in it as well, so that I don&#x27;t have to add these to my regimen as well. The size is 1 ounce, which is typical of serums I have bought on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Feels great! Seems to be working!</li>
    <li> Love skin care products that are made of natural ingredients. Use it day and night before cream and after tonner. The product is easily absorbed and makes my skin glowing. Love this feeling.</li>
    <li> It works!  Noticed results in less than a week</li>
    <li> Seems to give my skin a more consistent tone.  Very nice to use, not sticky when it dries, seems to really help my moisturizer do its job, especially under my eyes.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Definitely brightens and moisturizes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become a vitamin c lover! This has made my face so flawless! I have even skin tone now and have received many compliments on how great I look!</li>
    <li> I love using products made in the USA! I also love that this is not tested on animals. I like that it can be worn under your makeup and that you can use it daily at any point day or night. I lover the bright orange color and the orange scent that it has. It leaves your skin feeling nice and smooth. I did follow up with a moisturizer after like the product tells you too...otherwise it would have left my skin feeling sticky. After applying this sitting in my sauna of a bedroom even my sweat feels refreshing with this on my skin! I will try and update my review after a week or two of using to see if i can tell a difference or not.</li>
    <li> I am currently having a serious love affair with hyaluronic acid. My face looks so dewy, fresh, and moisturized after using this. If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days, I can tell a difference in my skin. This serum definitely helps my face look brighter and skin tone more even. I recently noticed age spots on the backs of my hands (probably from lots of gel manicures) and I started using this on the backs of my hands as well. The spots are lightening! I love it. I am always highly satisfied and pleased with InstaNatural products.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent, the texture and how easily my skin absorbs it! Great product.</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of products from this company and they are actually pretty good. The only thing that I&#x27;m very concerned about and why I rate this product one star, is because I was reading all the good reviews, (This one is actually the only bad review on here), but I had to give it one star because the reviews seem to be FAKE!! I&#x27;m not saying its a bad product, but look at the dates on the reviews: THEY ARE ALL FROM MAY!!!! everybody decided to review this item AT THE SAME TIME!!!, and if you check the &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34; I read all the products these people reviewed and they are all POSITIVE! How come????? Are you serious??? So you are going to tell me that these people bought a lot of stuff on amazon and everything was an excellent product, EVERYTHING!!!! For real???? WOW!! These people are so lucky to receive good items, that work perfect, in excellent conditions!! I guess I&#x27;m not one of those lucky people.. SMH!</li>
    <li> This vitamin c is indeed skin brightening  serum.  I already see the result in  I week. I love it.</li>
    <li> Item sent for review, I love vitamin C and this works better than a higher end brand that I use.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  The lines on my forehead are softening after using the serum for 2 weeks.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different face creams but this is the best product I have ever used.  I started seeing results right away.  What I noticed most was a clearer, lighter complexion and brown spots diminished.  I have never used a product that works this well.  I have already ordered another bottle.  I use it in the morning and before I go to bed.  I love it so much that when my husband and I went camping for four days, I made sure to take it with me.  I continued morning and night. I never want to be without this and I am so happy that the product does what it says because frankly, I am sick and tired of being lied to and spending my hard earned money on products that do not work.  This is not one of those.  This is the real deal and I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Perfect balance for reading those dreaded sun damaged spots. Great refreshing citrus scent.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle of this and I can honestly say that this is an effective serum! I&#x27;m super picky about the products that I use on my face because I have sensitive acne prone skin, so I tend to break out easily. Although I was skeptical I gave this serum a shot and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  My dark spots and acne scars have lightened up tremendously!  I feel like the overall condition of my skin has improved also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Serum itself is a cloudy orange color not like any of the traditional vitamin C serums that I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s very thick, but absorbs into the skin very quickly.  It&#x27;s actually hydrating too. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s from the Hyaluronic Acid.  After using it my face looks bright and dewy! Did I mention that it smells fantastic,  it literally smells just like an orange.  I love this serum and will be purchasing it again for sure! I did purchase my first bottle at a discount in exchange for my honest feedback, but will now be purchasing more of this at full price because it honestly is just that good.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good ingredients -- great price.</li>
    <li> I use this o my face everyday.  Watch it before you go out somewhere &amp; make sure you get all of it rubbed in because it will leave orange streaks.  I am a member of Elite Deal Club &amp; get to try awesome products at a great price.</li>
    <li> This serum smells heavenly! The scent comes from clementine essential oil, the orange color from antioxidants, and the refreshing tingle from vitamin C. It&#x27;s a refreshing burst with no pungent or artificial overtones, and it&#x27;s hard to stop applying. It is a vivid orange color, smooth and slippery in consistency, and dries quickly. It has good coverage, so one ounce will last quite a while. It doesn&#x27;t leave sticky or oily residue, but does have a tightening effect as it dries, which provides a slight cosmetic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it stung my sensitive rosacea prone face after about 10 minutes, and I had to wash it off. My hands and decollete, also areas in need of skin care to ward off aging,  tolerated it fine. Skin absorbs ingredients quickly, so if you experience a mild sting you may still be able to get good use out of this product by leaving it on for 5-10 minutes and then washing it off to remove the stinging vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product free or virtually so for testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My remarks are sincere and my own. In this case, please note that I was asked to write a review within 7 days. Thus I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to evaluate long-term durability or results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am a hobby formulator of skin care products and very familiar with most active ingredients used in such things. The three most common flaws are ineffective if hyped ingredients, insufficient amounts of effective ingredients, and only a few effective active ingredients in a formula. Many expensive and well-known skin care products are a travesty when you look at the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are actually percentages listed of six key ingredients in this serum, and they are at effective levels which I find impressive. There are a large number of active ingredients and very few fillers in this formula. In addition, many ingredients are organic. Overall, I find this an excellent formulation and one that is likely to actually improve your skin over time. Any &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; non-cosmetic results from a skin care product will take a while to manifest, so use the whole bottle before deciding whether it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way for me to know the quality of active ingredients in this, but I can comment on the ingredients listed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green tea: Not going to do much without being concentrated to an extract - filler/base ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Licorice: Valuable anti-inflammatory and lightening ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Bladderwrack: I haven&#x27;t been convinced it&#x27;s effective for anything&lt;br /&gt;Ginkgo biloba: unclear scientific evidence, more research needed&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate: Not specified oil, extract, juice, or other. Quality extract and oil has many beneficial properties including antioxidant.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe: No miracle for general skin care but is nice, soothing, etc. More of a filler/base.&lt;br /&gt;(25%) Vitamin C: somewhat stabilized ascorbic acid. Antioxidant, brightening, helps with sun damage. Needs to be relatively freshly mixed (don&#x27;t let this sit on your shelf for a year and expect good results). May increase photosensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;(20%) Hyaluronic Acid: excellent anti-aging, moisturizing ingredient&lt;br /&gt;(5%) Alpha arbutin: decreases tyrosinase activity&lt;br /&gt;(2.5%) Vitamin B3: decreases hyperpigmentation, inflammation, and itching&lt;br /&gt;(2.5%) Coenzyme Q10: One of the best anti-aging and revitalizing active ingredients available&lt;br /&gt;(1%) Wakame bioferment: A seaweed bioferment. I&#x27;m not familiar with this one, but kelp bioferment are excellent - this probably has positive effects.&lt;br /&gt;Clementine essential oil: Natural fragrance. May have anti-acne properties. Antioxidant. Increases photo-sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Carbomer: texture additive&lt;br /&gt;(2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid (aka arginine): Essential amino acid&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin: Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Astaxanthin: Anti-oxidant&lt;br /&gt;Surcrose stearate: thickener, skinsoftener&lt;br /&gt;Polyglyceryl laurate: emulsifier&lt;br /&gt;Lecithin: emulsifier, reduces fatty deposits around eyes&lt;br /&gt;Tocopherol: Anti-oxidant&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil: Moisturizes and provides fatty acids&lt;br /&gt;Gotu kola: Aids skin elasticity and firmness, strengthens veins and capillaries&lt;br /&gt;Propolis: Bee by-product, may have positive effects on skin&lt;br /&gt;Horsetail: Anti-inflammatory&lt;br /&gt;Dandelion: Anti-fungal, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant&lt;br /&gt;Geranium: Astringent, anti-acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of these active ingredients are quite expensive, and there are few fillers in this formulation, so I&#x27;d call it a superb value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that vitamin C serums may be too acidic for sensitive skin and rosacea sufferers.

    <li> It smells very citrus, and does brighten my tanned skin a little bit in a very short time.  But it leave a mark when it touches my cloth.</li>
    <li> I have uneven skin tone, dark circles and mild hyperpigmentation around my mouth. This skin brightening serum is light, orange and has a citrus scent. I apply the serum every night before I go to bed it feels a little bit stick on your hands but once you apply it on your face it dries up pretty fast and your face doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 2 weeks and my dark circles are less noticeable and my skin tone looks more even. I would recommend this serum to those with somewhat sensitive oily or dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; but i think that&#x27;s why it recommends to use a moisturizer after the product in the directions. I love the smell of citrus it has!</li>
    <li> Really nice formula, goes on smooth and feels great. My skin looks and feels better already! I use a few of these serums and I tend to swap them out on a regular basis. I can actually tell which one I&#x27;m using after just a day. This is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> It smells like orange juice. In a good way. I apply it on my face after my toner. Although I got a little pimple in the morning, I still gave it one more try. My skin is softer and brighter. Going to bed at 12 am and waking up at 4 am, my skin did not look dull at all.</li>
    <li> My eyes look so much more vibrant now. The dark circles have faded big time. I don&#x27;t look like I just woke up or haven&#x27;t had enough sleep. It absorbs really well into the skin. A little is all you need so don&#x27;t overdo it. Great product.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me.  Helped with my complexion and skin&#x27;s radiance.  After about a week I noticed a difference.  Great product</li>
    <li> Good product,feels very nice on my face.</li>
    <li> Skin feels smoother and no trouble with the high vitamin c content on my sensitive skin.  Since I also use the InstaNatural retinol serum which also contains 20% vitamin C, I only use a couple drops for each to avoid skin irritation.  My dermatologist recommends using vitamin c in the morning to neutralize damaging free radicals.  I tried both Obagi Professional C Serum 20 and C E Ferulic purchased from her office but had to be on and off due to skin irritation.  C E Ferulic made my face look shinny while Obagi is strong with alcohol and fragrance.  The InstaNatural is more gentle on skin, a vitamin c serum that I can really stick with.  Although I received a discount in exchanging my feedback, I was planning to try it even without the discount since they have a good lifetime refund policy.  I tried a different InstaNatural serum previously that my skin started having trouble a couple months after.  I contacted the company and they gave me a full refund without any problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a month now and my face is brighter and possibly the dark spots have lightened. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel great and smells good</li>
    <li> I give it 5 starts because I can&#x27;t give it more. The scent is fresh and fruity with an amazing texture. It has done wonders for my skin and I have only been using for one week. I can&#x27;t imagine how it will be in a couple of weeks! It leaves my skin soft and glowing! I got it with a promotional discount and I&#x27;m glad I have it a try!</li>
    <li> Wow!  Yes, yes, yes - this is the best line of products I&#x27;ve ever used.  I loved the other serum  (hyaluronic) but this is by far a product that goes above and beyond any expectation.  My worry lines have all nearly disappeared!!  In a matter of a month.  The lines were very very deep (I tend to scrunch/tense my face), nothing I used helped - my makeup even started to emphasis them and I resorted to rarely wearing makeup - which brings me to the next point.... my skin is smooth, soft, radiant, young and vibrant-looking.  I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like I &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; makeup (mascara, but really nothing else) anymore.  I&#x27;ll still wear it occasionally, when I do I definitely notice that I look much younger than I did 1-2 months ago!!  Thank you thank you! The serum is orange but it certainly doesn&#x27;t turn the skin orange.  The faint scent is refreshing.  The skin feels incredibly soft, a slight tightening can be felt around the eyes, but I don&#x27;t feel tight and dry.  I could go with or without moisturizer.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great Serum!! Does what it claims!! I LOVE InstaNatural  :)</li>
    <li> love the serum use it day and night together with the lotion and I already feel a good effect on my skin it has been about 2 weeks</li>
    <li> This serum smells good and goes on nicely on the skin without it being oily or heavy.  It contains antioxidants to help fight free radicals and brightening agents to even out skin tone and lighten dark spots like freckles and age spots.  It is moisturizing and a great serum for aging skin.</li>
    <li> I love this natural vitamin C serum.  It has 5% more vitamin C than most other serums.  I have noticed a gradual difference in my skin tone and overall completion since I have been using this serum.  The company has great customer service, fast delivery, and the item is well packaged.  I highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using this along with the scar gel immediately after showering and patting my face dry. It seems to be working well together. I did notice some minor breaking out in the first couple of days but it may have been that my skin just needed to get used to the product.  I have been using it morning and night for a couple of weeks now and my skin does seems to be much brighter.  I had a few dark patches that are definitely lighter and closer to my normal skin color so I am enjoying the results.</li>
    <li> Really like this.  It does brighten the skin and feel so good.  I am TORN between this one and the other one I bought which contains 20% Vitamin C which has seabuck and argan oil, two wonderful ingredients.</li>
    <li> WOW!  I have only been using this for a short time but can already feel a difference in my skin.  The ingredients are high quality, and I feel good about putting this on my face.  I would recommend this serum to anyone looking for a new skin care regime!</li>
    <li> No visible effects that I can see after several weeks of use; however, my skin may be different.  I have been using a vitamin C serum for many months, and my skin is already bright, clear, and glowing, so that may account for my lack of visible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the natural ingredients in this product and see nothing in there I&#x27;m not happy to use.  I&#x27;m really glad that more manufacturers are using natural products rather than the list of chemicals impossible to pronounce, so I&#x27;ll continue to use this natural product on my face.  It may simply be a matter of time until I get the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I was kind of hesitant about purchasing it because other Vitamin C products make my (overly) sensitive skin break out. But everyone is always going on about how awesome Vitamin C is, so I decided to purchase a more potent and professional one with better ingredients. First of all, it smells really good...which made me nervous at first. But the scent is a natural product of the ingredients, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I use it before bed and in the morning, before I put my make up on. I also apply it to my neck and chest area because I have a bad habit of sleeping on my sides, which results in creases in my skin. So far, it seems to be doing an excellent job of keeping my tone even and my skin looking rejuvenated and acne free. Very happy with this product, honestly. I will definitely be purchasing this regularly. It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the bottle will last a while. But you can use it all over, really. I&#x27;m sure it would do awesome things for stretch marks and scars too. I&#x27;ll have to test that out.</li>
    <li> Head&#x27;s up: I did not receive a discount for this review!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and I have noticed a dramatic lightening of a prominent sunspot on my cheek. So much so that when I was doing my makeup I thought I had a splotch of concealer on that spot when I had not applied any there. I&#x27;ve used a LOT of products to try to get rid of it. I used to work in the cosmetic department of Sak&#x27;s Fifth Avenue so I had access to everything. NOTHING worked like this works.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I&#x27;d pay double for this. And the fact that it&#x27;s pleasant smelling and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin is a definite plus.</li>
    <li> This is a must buy! I can already see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve tried many and this one out does them all. I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of the serum and the way it instantly makes your skin look ..,all the serums I have used have been excellent and my skin looks so much better after being very sick.., thank you to InstaNatural</li>
    <li> I have to say I have tried a bunch of products from this company and so far this is my favorite!  My skin is a little sensitive and this just blends in nicely with no reaction.  My skin feels softer and looks clearer and brighter - a few little lines are even softening!  The smell is light and the texture absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products to keep my skin looking young.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> Every time I use this my skin feels refreshed.</li>
    <li> Wife is very happy with the result on her skin.  I bought this for my wife as a gift and she loves the serum.  She has used other products from Instanaturals and loves the brand.  She has recommended the serum to others.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have tried several Vit C and hyaluronic acid acid serums and have liked several.  When I ran out of what I was using I decided to look around.  The 25% vitamin C caught my eye and the rest of the ingredients looked interesting so I gave it a shot. I have been using this for a few days and my skin is glowing.  I do not find it to be sticky or thick after it sets in.  I live in FL and I have oily skin prone to buildup so this was important to me.  So far I am sold. I really love this stuff.  It&#x27;s a great serum that I apply to my face, chest, neck, and the back of my hands everyday.</li>
    <li> I thought that I did not need any skin brightening, so I gave this to my grandma as a gift. Just after a few weeks, I notice that her skin is more vibrant and she looks younger. I am thinking now that maybe I could use some skin brightening, because my grandma looks great! If you want to be the one getting compliments on your skin instead of your grandma, you should get this!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum with every quality I look for. It&#x27;s natural and contains brightening agents that really work like Arbutin and Vitamin C. It&#x27;s also a comfortable consistency with a yummy orange color and scent. I have tried a lot of skincare products over the years that are quite costly and this is a great product with a reasonable price. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My skin is noticeably brighter than before. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week!</li>
    <li> I only just received the product, but already want to leave a positive feedback about the company. I&#x27;m from the Netherlands, and since they don&#x27;t ship there I had the item delivered at a friends address in LA. Unfortunately the package got lost. But... they were so kind to ship it all the way to the Netherlands for me again! So happy!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in the morning (I have the B3 for the night), and actually love the citrus smell to it. It makes your skin look orange first, but melts in real quick and gives you a radiant skin tone. I will review more once I have used the product longer!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Actually, everything I have ordered through this company really works well with my skin. I alternate between this serum and the age defying skin clearing serum with retinol. The retinol is a little irritating so I can&#x27;t use it everyday, but that stuff is crazy good too. I seriously have had a lot of people asking me what I have been doing with my skin and this is the only product change I have made. I recently purchased the vitamin c face wash also. A lot of face washes dry out my eyelids, but this stuff is primarily organic and my eyelids look fresh and clean. I love their products and highly highly recommend them! I plan to continue trying new stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month. I have light skin that has sun damage marks. I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic changes to my face, maybe a little change but not huge. I use this twice a day. It does smell great though. I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle just to make sure. If anything changes, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do a lot of postings, however, I had to with this product. I am in love. About 2 months ago I lost my mom.  Since the end of January 2015, I had been going back and forth from NYC, my hometown. I broke out so bad that I honestly thought I would have to go to the dermatologist and get a chemical peel. my face was awful and it did not help that to compensate, I would overdose on makeup to cover it up. I saw this product and thought I had nothing to loose.  IT WAS A FREAKING MIRACLE!!! this product worked so well to not only brighten my face, it also lighten all the acne scars that I had.  I will continue to use this product and the product line as I think its fantastic.  I can&#x27;t begin to tell you the difficulties that a African American women has finding products that work and don&#x27;t cause more damage then good.  I actually found one and love it.  I hope they keep up the good work as I have started to have my oldest child use their product line and it seems to work for her as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> Works great! I love the citrus scent of this! Will be buying more when this runs out!</li>
    <li> This is great. Love vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the way it makes my skin feels.  Great for hyperpigmentation,  and it&#x27;s not too oily. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I very much love the Skin Brightening Serum. I love the smell as well as how it makes my skin look and feel. My boyfriend even noticed a difference in my skin after I started using the serum. I like that it does not leave my face feeling sticky or greasy. It does not dry out my skin yet it is light enough that it does not leave me feeling like I have product on my face. I am pleasantly surprised with this product. I also appreciate the size of the bottle and the price point. All in all it is great for my skin type and helps smooth out my problem areas. I will continue to use this product and would love to try others as soon as I am in need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised by this. Got a discount so figured why not? One week in and I see the difference. I have blotchy skin and this has already helped it even out.</li>
    <li> Great product at a really great price!</li>
    <li> Great product made my skin look healthier and feel smoother</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so thrill to try this.... Can&#x27;t wait to see my face after a month of using this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great but I&#x27;m put off by yhe orange colored serum.</li>
    <li> SO glad to discover this treatment! Wish it had been invented a few decades ago :)  Gives a youthful glow to my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking the way my face feels after using this</li>
    <li> I am totally becoming a fan of InstaNatural products. This is the second product I have gotten from them and I love it! The serum has a nice texture to it so it goes on easily and is not thick. The absorption rate is wonderful so if you are putting it on at night you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on your sheets and if you are putting it on in the morning, you don&#x27;t have to wait forever to put on your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to admit I was a little taken aback when I first opened it because the serum is a bright orange, but don&#x27;t let that worry you it doesn&#x27;t leave any color on your skin. The smell is great. This is just a great product. Kudos to InstaNatural - you guys have a good product line going on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural provided this product for my review and feedback</li>
    <li> Has a great citrus smell. Used along with the Instanaturals face brightening scrub and my dull tired skin looks more refreshed after a week of using them. The dropper is handy for dispensing and allows you to easily measure out the product.</li>
    <li> The best skin care products that I ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This serum is a little thicker but goes on smoothly and smells wonderful. It makes your skins feel soft and wonderful. Have notice a huge difference In the way my skin feels and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. Will continue to use and highly recommend</li>
    <li> Excelent product. I can compare with Obagi and cost less.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again</li>
    <li> A great serum that works as well as the more expensive serums &amp; it smells great!</li>
    <li> Fixes any skin tone problems, deeply moisturizes my skin. I use it 2 or 3 times a day!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feels great and even made my pore tighter.  But I have only used this product for 2 weeks so far and I really need to get rid of &amp;#34;Pregnancy Mask&amp;#34; (dark spots around my cheek bones). Hope this would help. It seems to be helping but I can still see the dark spots clearly and I prefer to make this faded a little more. I will give a little more time to see the actual results.</li>
    <li> After using Instanatural Retinol Moisturizer I was anxious to start the complete daily regimen of this brand. I am middle aged with keloid scaring as result of teenage acne. These products are helping to diminish those scars. The Skin Brightening Serum is easy to apply, non-greasy (a plus for me) dries quickly and has a yummy orange scent. Shipping is fast and very convenient to order with Amazon. Communications is a plus, after contacting Instanatural by e-mail, they were quick to suggests other products that might work well for my skin. I&#x27;m looking forward to the long term results this serum will offer.</li>
    <li> I just received this item a few days ago and tried it the first night. I love the scent of citrus, and it&#x27;s mild on my skin. It does not cause any irritation around my eyes, as most products seem to do. I would definitely purchase this item again. I hope to get back and give a better review after trying it for a longer amount of time.</li>
    <li> I purchased the InstaNatural eye serum and liked it so much that I decided to try the Vitamin C brightening serum.  As I wrote in my review of the eye serum the ingredients in the InstaNatural products are everything that I look for in anti-aging products.  (you can do the research yourself)  I am just as impressed with the  vitamin C serum.  I do not find it sticky and I really love the smell.  I use in the morning and before I go to bed.  I am excited to try some of the other products.</li>
    <li> Love it and the fact that it has vitamin C is a plus no regrets with this product I keep seeing better and better results through the weeks I apply it in the morning and before bed</li>
    <li> This product is slightly thick and orange in color. It absorbs nicely. It does not feel sticky or oily and my skin feels nice when it dries.  I use it twice a day followed by a moisturizer. I have skin that is sensitive and this product has not caused any problems. We&#x27;ll see how it works in the long-run but for now I am happy with the product and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works well - if you can get over the smell! I don&#x27;t mind smelling like oranges in the morning, but definitely not something I would want to use at night.</li>
    <li> I can tell a different in my skiln when I use this.  Plus it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> This feels really nice on my skin.  I put it on after my toner and before my moisturizer before bed.  I really like it.  My skin feels very nourished.</li>
    <li> Love this product, will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few days, but my skin is so much softer and brighter. It goes on so smoothly.  I still need to use another moisturizer since my skin is sodry.  I love that it includes COQ 10 which is supposed to be great for your skin.  I have used  so many skin preparations for wrinkles in the past, but hyuralonic acid seems to really fit the bill.  I will definitely buy this again and recommend it to my friends. I received a discount for reviewing this product.</li>
    <li> Anything InstaNatural is right up my alley.  I have very sensitive skim so this is a relief for my skin.  Starting the second week of using this, my skin feels softer and lighter, I guess brighter, seems like my pores are as clean as ever.  I love this!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new go-to serum at the moment. It has more vitamin C in it than any others I have. It also has 20% Hyaluronic Acid which is a great moisturizer. I was really excited about this skin brightening serum because I have some dark spots and acne scars on my face that make me very self conscious. The Alpha Arbutin and Niacinamide just make my skin glow and look so much healthier. The CoQ10 in this serum helps fight the signs of aging and repairs dry, cracked, wrinkled, and blotchy skin too. I noticed my little sun spots I hate are starting to slowly disappear thanks to this serum. My skin is a lot softer, much more hydrated, and overall healthier looking. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> **update** I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a couple weeks and am astounded with the results, for the first time in 3 years my face really is &#x27;brighter&#x27;! my dark spots have deminished by 75% &amp; I&#x27;ve just now gotten down to the top of the label so it&#x27;s lasting. i will put this on every day for the rest of my life if i need to, the results are THAT good! upping my rating to 5 stars **end update** Very happy with my purchase. A little goes a long way so less is more &amp; this bottle will last months which is great bc im using twice/day &amp; seeing great results after just 5 days. 4 stars bc i forgot to use it one day &amp; darkness came right back so this is a temporary solution but I&#x27;m very happy with the product &amp; how quickly it&#x27;s working to even out my dark spots, even acne scars &amp; it&#x27;s easy to apply &amp; wears well under moisturizer &amp; makeup</li>
    <li> First of all, the serum is really really thick reddish orange, be careful when you use it, it might stain your clothes. Secondly, it smells really good if you like citrus, this is one of the strongest smelling serum I&#x27;ve had. It is almost like putting orange juice on your face. Thirdly, it is kind of a sticky texture, so after application, your face would be a little stickier than usual, it feels fine after I top it with moisturizer so it&#x27;s not really a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;It does feel like my skin is getting a little brighter and the acne scars are fading</li>
    <li> Vitamin C, This serum feels luxurious on they skin. It absorbs quickly into the skin and has fabulous results! It is moisturizing and makes my skin glow. It has plumped up my fine lines and wrinkles and smoothed my skin out and given my skin an all over younger look! I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I just got this product few days ago. I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Been using for a week now, however haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference.</li>
    <li> This skin brightening serum is incredibly smooth on my skin. I have such glow which remind me of pregnacy days. Even my  husband noticed that my face was &amp;quot;radiating &amp;quot;.... that was his  own word.</li>
    <li> This has become my new favorite product to use accompanied by the scrub and serum. I have light freckeling and some pigmentation, enough to bother me... These skin brightening products work great. I use this lotion under my makeup one of those a little goes a long way products..... I PURCHASED this product at a DISCOUNT in order for my Honest and Unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!&#x27;it makes my skin look great. As always instanatural delivered a high quality product</li>
    <li> Frankly I did not see any difference</li>
    <li> Caused my skin to rash out! :(</li>
    <li> Great! I loveeee it! My skin has been changed a little dark since I lived in the sunshine state.My son found this brightening serum and suggested me give a try. I have to say it was a good decision. After two weeks, I saw some difference on my face and even The part by my right eyes had some dark spots existing there a few years. Now those spots are lighter a little bit. For the price of this serum, I really feel it is far  worth the money.  if you want to change your dark skin, then this is your choice. Also I like the Orange smell.</li>
    <li> Skin looks much more smoother</li>
    <li> This is the first vitamin c serum I have tried and I have to say I love it! I have been using this serum for about almost a month and I can definitely see a difference in my skin. Not only is the smell delicious but the serum has faded the overall discoloration in my skin. I would definitely recommend this product. It was worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love it works great will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I did notice that it is a little sticky, so I use at night time.  A little goes a long way!  I haven&#x27;t really noticed too much of a change in my skin at this point of use.</li>
    <li> I typically do not write reviews for skincare products. As a guy in his late 30s, I must say this product has the potential to restore vibrance, youth, and elasticity to the skin. I do use it in combination with hyaluronic acid and collagen based toners and it seems that the serum has synergistic effects with the toners. I honestly noticed that every morning after I wash my face, it really is smoother and virtually all of the pores have minimized that they are barely visible.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again. A little steep price but hey, the fountain of youth does come with a price. It is a bonus that it smells really delicious.</li>
    <li> I can see a slight difference in my skin. I just started so I&#x27;m giving it time. My face does feel softer.</li>
    <li> I love that this product has most of my serums in one bottle! I can eliminate most of my routine by just applying this one serum. I did not read reviews before hand, so the color was a bit shocking at first. I was not expecting it to be bright orange! The smell is very citrusy like most vitamin C serums. I use this along with the skin brightening facial scrub in the morning when I want a lighter cleansing on my face. I have noticed my skin feels smoother and the fine lines that have been working in my eye area are slowly smoothing out. This product is going on the top of my list along with the cleanser. A+ for InstaNatural, you have done it again!</li>
    <li> LOVE! Does not make your skin greasy and feels great on!  The product is priced perfectly as well.  Am purchasing again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Vitamin c with Hyaluronic acid serum very good product. Not only smooth your skin but also keep your skin&lt;br /&gt;hydrated. It also lighten up my freckles too. One product give you so many goodies how can&#x27;t i give less than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Tightened my face very nicely, could tell after about a week!</li>
    <li> Made me break out badly. Skin looked awful with little bumps after using for few days. Stopped using it after a week and skin was back to normal.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I suffer from melasma and mild adult acne and in just 3 days this product has brightened my skin, lightened my melasma and decreased the dark purplish scars from acne. It also seems to be shrinking my pores as well. I use it under my make up and it gives me a glowing complexion. My husband has even commented on how great my skin looks. I have tried several products that make no difference after months and months... this was insta satisfaction. I am really impressed. The product does go on a little sticky but once I apply my moisturizer my skin is baby smooth. Also seems to help to keep my make up from breaking up as I sweat during the hot New Orleans Summer days &amp; nights. I will amend this review as I continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;---I am now a month and a half into this treatment and halfway thru my 2nd bottle. I am AMAZED! NOTHING HAS WORKED THIS WELL! I AM A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. My skin feels tighter and brighter. My pores appear smaller. Very happy :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while, I see a slight change on my face and I guess it will take some time.</li>
