      <li>I am having, for the most part, very good luck with both the stamper and the scraper.  </li>
      <li>I love this very good</li>
      <li>Not as happy with this product as I would have liked it too be.  </li>
      <li>I lightly filed it with my nail filer and removed the dust with a piece of scotch tape and that was all it required to make this stamper work perfectly.</li>
      <li>Really loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The scraper is good too.</li>
      <li>Good stamp.  </li>
      <li>If you want a specialized scraper, though, this one is good; just know that you&#x27;re paying for the plastic card and may as well throw away the stamper.</li>
      <li>A good semi flexible stamper.</li>
      <li>Good , on Time, product as in the picture.</li>
      <li>Stamper does not work, scraper is good</li>
      <li>The stamper is of a good quality.</li>
      <li>Good stamper over all.  </li>
      <li>I did some research and it seemed like a good price</li>
      <li>The squishiness of the stamper is great and, after I cleaned it and roughed it up with a nail file (like the description recommends) I got great, clear images that transferred perfectly.</li>
      <li>Works great better  then the rubber one I had.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this purchase and stamper.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I like this Pueen one way better!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE this stamper!</li>
      <li>I love these things and i cant wait to use them on my stamping plates!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stamper size is good I&#x27;m used to using this size compare it to the konad stamper love it my new go to</li>
    <li> At first it didn&#x27;t work cause I didn&#x27;t prime it and I used alcohol But after getting lint roller and lightly buffing it works every time now!!! And it is very squishy ;D</li>
    <li> This is small but adequate.</li>
    <li> It took a while for me to get it to work right.  My cousin has the same one and hers picks up the images every time where mine only works 75%, even after priming.  Still it keeps my daughters busy and happy so I love it for that.</li>
    <li> It came quickly. And it works really Good!</li>
    <li> amazing stamper a little smaller then i expected and takes the right pressure but once u get that down its wonderful</li>
    <li> You do have to clean it with acetone but it works with my nails. This one is one of my favorite ones and I&#x27;m kind of new at the whole stamping thing. It molds to my nails and some designs that don&#x27;t fit my thumb get stretched to fit it with this. I admit I thought I made a mistake at first but after prep it work wonders and yes do it fast scrape and pick fast.</li>
    <li> It does the job and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> The scraper is fine, in fact u can use an old credit card or plastic of that type n it will scrap off polish just fine, The rubber part is pure junk, keeps coming out, n first time it kinda worked then after five times it doesn&#x27;t its just junk i regret wasting time n money on this</li>
    <li> Works well but scraper immediately fell apart. And silicone piece keeps coming out.</li>
    <li> Stamper was way smaller than when I realized it would be. And of the stamper tended to pop out. However the scraper is the best scraper I have. love it.</li>
    <li> The shipping was timely, but the product just doesn&#x27;t work well. The rubber tip is really gummy and doesn&#x27;t pick up any of the polish on the stamp. The scraper on the other hand works really well and its cardboard or something so it doesn&#x27;t scratch or feel like its scraping your stamp sheet. I do use the scrapper but I&#x27;m unsatisfied with the stamper.</li>
    <li> this little soft squishy stamper is awesome!  like magic it lifts the polish from the plate and goes on nicely! i bought the SHANY cosmetic plates, they are awesome!!</li>
    <li> Crap! The thing falls apart it&#x27;s not secured at all. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Not as happy with this product as I would have liked it too be.  The stamper only worked half the time (even with it buffed).  And doesn&#x27;t pick up image as well as I&#x27;d like them to be.  I do not use the scraper…don&#x27;t like it..use an old credit card instead.</li>
    <li> Its pretty awesome the way the stamps turned out. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but the silicone part falls out sometimes. I kinda wish it would stay in ya know?</li>
    <li> I primed it and it won&#x27;t work :( I just purchased the templates also not sure if they work since the stamper does not</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly and I am very pleased with this product. I primed it and it works beautifully. I really like this scraper too. I think it&#x27;s one of my favorites. Thank you for being so prompt in sending this!</li>
    <li> The end is sticky and only transfers a couple times and them quits working. Too much hassle to use</li>
    <li> Worst stamper ever! I ordered hoping it would work but it did the complete opposite. The stamper does not even work at all, I mean not even one bit. The soft part of the stamper keeps coming off even before I used it. The scraper is a piece of card board. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it is what I expected, a friend recommended...</li>
    <li> Makes stamping easy, thank you.</li>
    <li> Works well no problems no filing needed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
    <li> This stamp and scrapper works really well. Just remember to take off the blue cover sheet.</li>
    <li> I could not get the paint to stick very well. Then when I got it to stick it basically dried to the stamper before I could even stamp onto the nail. I tried several different kinds of paint and I know it has to be the stamper. Then not to mention that the white part does not stay in the pink. So of course when it fell it collected anything on the ground.... The scraper is also cardboard or something. IT isn&#x27;t very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! The squishy is like a marshmallow! I love these things and i cant wait to use them on my stamping plates!</li>
    <li> I love this stamper!!! When I received it I was upset because I didn&#x27;t think something so small would work but I was WRONG! The stamper is much smaller than the classic Konad stamper. This stamper works beautifully ! I mainly use it to stretch my designs because it is a marshmallow / super squishy stamper.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t  stamp and the rubber it&#x27;s not attached. Not like it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS! THIS IS NOT THE SAME STAMPER THAT IS ADVERTISED ANYMORE!!!! I added a picture to show that they sent me a stamper head that IS NOT what is in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder there are poor reviews for this now!!!! this is NOT the amazing pueen marshmallow stamper that people rave about. im not sure if pueen changed it but i cant imagine WHY bc if it aint broke dont fix it. and if they DID change it why not update the pictures so you arent duping customers? (i messaged pueen and will edit this if they did indeed discontinue the marshmallow stamper)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i bought this SAME listing two years ago and received the stamper in the picture. i recently gave it to my younger cousin to learn stamping and get into it. BIGGEST REGRET EVER! i thought oh i could just buy it again on amazon. NOPE NOPE NOPE!!!! i went to the SAME LISTING, bought THE SAME ITEM thinking it would be WHAT IS IN THE PICTURE AND IT ISNT! i find that REALLY deceptive. im a little salty, YES, bc i gave away my holy grail stamper (next to the creative shop stamper NOTHING could stamp as well as this WHITE ONE not the one i got) thinking i could still get it here but they sent it with a CLEAR JELLY top NOT WHITE MARSHMALLOW. and those DO NOT stamp the same! they should really update this listing. what is being sold in the picture is NOT what i received. i will leave my FIRST review from two years ago up bc i did LOVE that stamper but that is NOT what i got this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**THIS WAS MY REVIEW FROM 2015 when i got the WHITE MARSHMALLOW STAMPER**&lt;br /&gt;I  LOVE this stamper! It was my first one i admit other than this salon express rubber one that STUNK but it works SO much better than rubber stamps for me.  The silicone picks up and spreads the image way easier for me so i can press it directly down on the nail and not have to roll. i do notice that sometimes the way i push it down and changes my image by spreading it out more or  making straight lines squiggly. i dont know howelse to explain it but i am just a novice stamper so i am sure when i practice my technique i can avoid doing this as this doesnt always happen so im doing something wrong! LoL Overall i love love love this stamper. i wish it was a bit bigger the size took me be surprise because in the picture you cant really see it scaled so it was smaller than i imagined but i was not using XL stamping plates so all my images fit on it. Oh and a tip that might help prolong its shelf life is that i read it isnt good to use acetone on it to clean it off as it breaks down the silicone! i didnt know this so the first few times using it i was doing that and wish i hadnt! It still seems to work fine though. A tip i have picked up along the way is to use a lint brush to clean the stamper! It may sound weird but it works like a charm! the sticky paper on the lint brush takes the extra polish off the stamper without damaging it!</li>
    <li> The actually &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; came broken. The white circle piece keeps falling out 😞. I can&#x27;t get it to pick up the designs. Im heartbroken. Someone please help</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the squeegee applicator. The scraper works. I have a different brand applicator that works better and I wanted to try a smaller applicator. I&#x27;ve tried several types of nail polishes. My MIL has the same squeegee and hers works with just about most polishes; from high-end to your average dollar polish.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s super soft, yes it&#x27;s super squishy.  You can pull and squish this pad all you want and get a great design from your plates. I should know,  I did it. There are others out there that advertise as being super soft and squishy but this one actually is, and it doesn&#x27;t even make your fingers hurt when you really have to press down to get your print on.</li>
    <li> The scraper is cardboard and the stamp falls apart and actually doesn&#x27;t work at all...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to stamping and I&#x27;m happy to say that this stamper works great! You just need to prep it by filling off the top shiny layer then you&#x27;re good to go. The only con is that the stamper part will come out while cleaning it off, so you need to be careful and use a light touch.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE STAMPER ESP FOR SMALL SHORT NAILS! THANK YOU FOR GREAT SERVICE!!!! :)</li>
    <li> After I figured out how to prime it I love it. The reason I gave it a 4 is cause there were no instructions in the package but other than than I love them</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t transfer stamps, even after the silicone surface is prepped.</li>
    <li> SHave your money. I went to stamp my nail and the rubber fell out have to keep putting it back in now my rubber stamp has a rip in it. Very cheaply made not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This took me a while to get, but after some practice I really like this stamper. I may buy a couple more.</li>
    <li> I like this little stamper.  I ordered 3 different brands from three different suppliers  at the same time and this is my go to stamper and scraper. I have just started stamping and this one fits my nails just right.  The scraper is small, simple, and easy for me to be accurate with it.  I expect it won&#x27;t last forever, but it&#x27;s easy to use, fits in my hand and is so easy to clean with no extra crevices to try to clean out. I did buff it, and one video suggested rolling it in your fingers to &#x27;soften&#x27; it and whatever I did, it works better than my other two more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I had ordered a different stamper from Pueen which I was disappointed with; however this one is really cute and actually works. Yeah; it works very well! The scraper is still the metal type which I don&#x27;t like because they scratch your plates. The stamper is about 2 inches in length and the actual stamping end is 1 inch wide or so. The end is soft silicon so you don&#x27;t have to press down really hard to stamp the image on to your nails. The images stamp really well with this one. I just wish Pueen would put this stamper with a good plastic scraper. I never wear my nails long so for people with really long nails they might need a stamper that is the XL kind.</li>
    <li> This thing works amazingly well!  I also have a Konad double-ended stamper and I pretty much quit using it ever since I got my Pueen soft stamper. The Konad one is stiff and I often have to start over because it misses the back of my nail where the nail bed meets the cuticle, or on the sides of my nail if I didn&#x27;t roll it enough.  These issues are completely alleviated with the Pueen squishy stamper.  I also had issues with the Konad when I was using metallic polish to stamp, because I would waste so much time trying to line it up properly so as to be able to cover my whole nail, that the polish would dry and it would only partially transfer.  No more issues with this stamper, so multiple benefits...BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> Definitely not &amp;#34;no mess, no fuss&amp;#34;.  As soon as I opened it and picked it up, the white &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; part fell out.  It isn&#x27;t glued in, and I&#x27;m forever having to put it back.  Ok, not that big of a deal.... but the scraper is rippled and so does not scrape the stamp plate clean.  It&#x27;s utterly worthless, so I just use an old rewards card instead.  You get what you pay for I guess.  My kids have gotten better things out of the quarter machines though at the store.  I&#x27;ll be ordering another set from another brand.</li>
    <li> The stamper didn&#x27;t pick up the nail polish. I tried it several times and it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The stamper is not glued to the handle so it comes unattached at times and every time you try to wipe it off.  I am trying to practice with this one but went out and bought another one instead.</li>
    <li> the nail stamp will not transfer polish onto rubber stamper let alone the nail!!!&lt;br /&gt;ive tried over and over its just not happening</li>
    <li> Great stamper! Just as expected and picks up designs really well since it is so squishy. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good stamp. The scraper doesn&#x27;t last but  I use old credit cards instead.</li>
    <li> The stamper works great, it does fall out of the handle. But I found it helps a little bit to clean that it can come out. My package was missing the scraper, which is the main reason I ordered this kit. I&#x27;m disappointed it was missing and can&#x27;t contact the seller. Otherwise a satisfactory buy.</li>
    <li> This works but it does take practice!</li>
    <li> The stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. It wouldn&#x27;t work for me at all. Even after priming it</li>
    <li> Let me start this off by saying that I&#x27;ve never done nail stamping before, so if you have this will all probably be painfully obvious to you.  But when I first got this I was furious, because it clearly didn&#x27;t work at all and all the positive reviewers were liars and STAMPING YOUR NAILS IS STUPID ANYWAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t picking up any polish AT ALL with my stamper, but after changing three things I fixed the issue, and now I can stamp reliably and prettily.&lt;br /&gt;1) DON&#x27;T PUSH SO HARD ON THE PLATE.  When at first I didn&#x27;t stampceed, I tried again by pushing harder and harder, trying to pick up anything by mashing the stamper into the plate.  I read somewhere online that a gentler touch would fare better.  Sure enough, it turns out that I apply about the same amount of pressure onto the plate as I apply with a pen when I&#x27;m writing on paper, and that works waaaaay better.&lt;br /&gt;2) TRY FILING THE SURFACE OF YOUR STAMPER.  This creates a slight variance in texture that can help pick up the stamp better.&lt;br /&gt;3) SPEED AND CLEANLINESS ARE YOUR FRIENDS.  This falls into the &amp;#34;duh&amp;#34; category for all you stamping veterans, but really, from the time you scrape your design to the time you have it on the stamper needs to be fairly short, or the polish will dry in the plate.  Similarly, if, say, you&#x27;ve been trying to pick up stamps and keep angrily re-applying polish to the same stamp without cleaning it out once in a while, the grooves of your plate will already be filled with dried polish, making it impossible for the wet stuff to get in there.  When you go to scrape the plate, you&#x27;ll just take all the wet polish with you, leaving nothing behind for the stamper to pick up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I figured out these three things the stamper worked perfectly.  Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> Love theses stampers good quality product delivered quickly very pleased!!!!😊</li>
    <li> This stamper isn&#x27;t that great. The only way I can get it to even pick up designs is to buff the surface with a file after almost every stamp. I like the plastic scraper, but I will be looking for another stamper.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it. Only issue is that when &#x27;roughening&#x27; applicator, the silicone pops out and then I have to play keep away from my pets.</li>
    <li> Rubber thing immediately fell off- I guess I can glue it but you would think that they would do that already</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing it works like it should and it came on time. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better</li>
    <li> the silicone stamp is too soft, hard to pick up pattern. hard to use. The scrape is too small. some plastic card is better than it.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t stamp very well, I&#x27;m disappointed. I try buffing the stamper and it work for a few designs but then it would not pick up nothing. I tried using different kinds of nail polish too....still stinks. It&#x27;s sitting on my table collecting dust... just a waist of money.</li>
    <li> Most of the time I can&#x27;t get it to pick up the image in not sure if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing wrong or the stamper itself</li>
    <li> This stamper worked perfectly right out of the packaging. I did not need to prime it at all, the only thing I did was rinse it with soap and water, then wipe dry with a lint free wipe.  It picked up each time, every time.. I will most definitely be purchasing another one of these stampers.</li>
    <li> The rubber on the stamp keeps coming out.  May have to glue it or something to keep it tightly on.  Just a little annoying to work with but the stamp works fine.</li>
    <li> Really soft! Picked up the image great! Best buy so far!</li>
    <li> This PUEEN Nail Art Super Soft Squishy Silicone Stamper and Scraper Set I swear is made for a child’s nails.  I did some testing with it to see if I could even figure out a way to use it because the stamper is so small that I literally could not even believe my eyes when I opened the package LOL and I knew right off the bat that it could in no way stamp my long nails with one stamp fully.    I did have to prime it by using a cotton ball with pure 100% acetone on it and then I had to lightly file the top of it.  The silicone stamper top kept coming out of its holder which really made me mad and there was no way to keep it in there so I glued it in and now it is secure for using and not messing up my nails when I go to stamp them.  The stamper works good after everything I did to make it work but I feel the product should have come this way to begin with.  I can use it I want to stamp on a single flower etc., but it will in no way stamp my whole nail because my nails are about 1 ¼ inches long.    The scraper tool is fabulous and works perfectly not scratching my nail stamp plates.  I tried it on several brands of nail stamp plates and it is excellent.  Just so you know, you really need the correct kind of polish for stamping.  If the polish is really thin, it is not going to work.  The polish needs to be thick in order for the stamper to pick it up once you have scraped it with the scraper.  There are a ton on the market.  No special brand needed just thicker polish.    I would recommend this PUEEN Nail Art Super Soft Squishy Silicone Stamper and Scraper Set as long as you understand you will have to prime it and most importantly you need tiny short nails if you are looking to stamp your whole nail.  If you have long nails like I do then it is not going to stamp your whole nail.    [...]  Thank you  :)</li>
    <li> I am new to stamping and bought one of those cheap double ended ones. It was like trying to pick up paint on a hard rubber ball then apply it to your nail in some very skilled rolling motion. Yeah so it didn&#x27;t work at all. I was so frustrated I thought I was missing some key thing. Thankfully I found this item! Even the scraper worked better than the credit card I was using. I&#x27;m so happy. First stamp came out great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very soft and squishy. I just stamp it right onto the polish after scraping then right onto my nail. Works like a charm and cleans off whatever may be left easily.</li>
    <li> I love this stamper. It&#x27;s squishy and large enough to get all around my very curved nails. It&#x27;s easy to clean, as the silicon pops right out of the holder (though it stays in while in use). It can get some fuzz and such on it if you&#x27;re not careful, but I always set it down on plastic rather than cloth so I haven&#x27;t had much of a problem with that. I like the little baggie it comes in for storage. The scraper isn&#x27;t robust, but it suffices and is probably better for the plates than the metal ones.</li>
    <li> The stamper was dirty has some black liqudy stuff on it. I wasdhe dit off and it was okay. The silicone part keeps coming off im not sure if i have to glue it or what.</li>
    <li> I cannot even figure out why they made this product. I have tried other stampers that work beautifully while this one doesn&#x27;t work at all. NOT AT ALL. I tried several polishes, but it absolutely wouldn&#x27;t transfer. Yes, like the other review state, the squishy part comes out constantly... but I could glue it in and get past it if actually worked. I tried roughing it up, too, but nothing. This is a terrible product.</li>
    <li> An AMAZING marshmallow stamper!!!! I have a ton of stampers, and this is by far my FAVORITE!!! Picks up images with big and tiny details!!! I&#x27;m definitely getting a few back up stampers!!!</li>
    <li> It was impossible for me to use correctly, threw it away but kept the scraper</li>
    <li> This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;First of all.... no where on the package does it give you any direction that you need to \\&quot;prime\\&quot; it. Which I find to be a crucial mistake on the company&#x27;s part if they want someone to be successful with stamping. Not that it matters anyways... I primed it by buffing, filing, cleaning with non-acetone, cleaning with acetone, using a lint brush, using masking tape, cleaning with dish soap, and every other thing mentioned by reviewers short of having Picasso rise from the dead to paint my nails himself. Nothing worked no matter how soft or hard I pressed, whether I tapped or rolled. I think I got a partial picture once on the stamper... But never anything I&#x27;d actually attempt to stamp on my nails. 3 hours of my life down the toilet because of this horrible stamper.</li>
    <li> Rubber came apart when received. Not recommended!</li>
    <li> The scraper did not work for me i had to use my Old school ID&#x27;s to scrape off the nail polish correctly. Other than that the stamper is great for begginers.</li>
    <li> It was a complete waste of money. It fell apart immediately. I would not recommend this to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> This is really not good - the stamper is way to squishy - very difficult if not impossible to get crisp image transfer. The scraper is literally a piece of cardboard. No rubber, no plastic, not even fully laminated. It is a piece of crap. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works great, I have several of these and this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Stamper wont pick up image from plate. I thought that maybe the nail polish was to thin so I tried polishes with a more thicker formula but nothing, the stamper still didn&#x27;t work. Then I tried it with Conad polish which is very thick and it kindda picked it up but did not stamp on the nail very well, the image was smudgy and some of the image didn&#x27;t even get on the nail. Not worth returning so I tossed it. Don&#x27;t waist your money, buy a Conad stamper better, they work with any polish, that&#x27;s what I did.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s first try at stamping. The images somehow did not get picked up initially but when she filed the stamper, they picked up pretty clean (used BMC lacquer set no 1). Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> stamper came apart after a few usages save your money....</li>
    <li> Scraper works great stamp is too soft won&#x27;t puck up nail art off template. Fast shipping though.</li>
    <li> Works great once you scuff it up a little. I had to take a file to it and remove the slick skin. A good semi flexible stamper.</li>
    <li> perfect little stamper</li>
    <li> very handy when you need a softer stamper, like with some polishes or some stamps that it&#x27;s hard to pick up the image, this one helps</li>
    <li> You really get what you pay for with this product. I ordered two and one was completely smashed in the package. Not real impressed. Will look for a better made stamper.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the scraper with it, the pad is hard to use</li>
    <li> Best stamper I have. I&#x27;m ordering extras! I&#x27;ve used other stampers, soft and hard, but this picks up the design 95% of the time- the other times it&#x27;s because the plate needs a harder stamper. LOVE IT. Buying more. The scraper is good too.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered fast, but the problem was that white thing come off really easy. I will no recommend someone who hate loose stuff, but if you look it to the bright side it does work. The only problem the white thing come off for no reason. I will recommend Konad stamping it works better and the thing doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with my Order I just received it in the mail today and I was CRACKED in half ... I so mad that I paid $5.25 for this and before I even opened the see through bag it was packed in you can see it was Cracked right down the middle. Now I can&#x27;t even use it ...... Ughhhhh NOT HAPPy</li>
    <li> This stamper works wonderfully! Its soft and works great transferring images onto nails. I would highly recommend this product. Thanks</li>
    <li> At first i could not get it to stamp and i  searched u tube and found out how to prime it i know most people love their konad stamper and they are good but if your nails are short like mine this is much better no rolling just place your finger where u want it its simply put its perfect</li>
    <li> This works just as expected. It is kind of small and the sponge does pop out occasionally but it can be put right back in. Mine did not work at first so I lightly filed it and cleaned it with acetone and now it works perfect!</li>
    <li> The first couple of times I wasn&#x27;t able to get it to stamp any of the images.. But after reading the reviews and using a nail file to get off the shinny &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; it works like a charm!!!!!</li>
    <li> Order stamp plates and stamper set. Plates are great, but only recieved scrapper (which, fyi, is a small piece of plastic, half the size of a credit card) and not the actual stamper (didn&#x27;t really need scrapper, as you can use any credit card or gift card for this function) apparently I cannot get a replacement, would have to have a refund, but only after I send this ten cent scraper back. I&#x27;m sorry, I won&#x27;t be wasting my time going to a printing shop to print a label. I shouldn&#x27;t have had to.</li>
    <li> The product description is definitely not misleading.  There is nothing holding the silicone in the handle, so every time I tried to stamp it fell right out.  I ended up securing it with gorilla glue, which means I cannot replace the stamper when the time comes, but I&#x27;ll just buy a new one.  The scraper fell apart after the first use, but that&#x27;s ok because it didn&#x27;t even work that well.  A gift card or old credit card make better scrapers.  The squishiness of the stamper is great and, after I cleaned it and roughed it up with a nail file (like the description recommends) I got great, clear images that transferred perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love my Pueen stamper. I did have to prime it (I just looked on youtube for how-to&#x27;s) and once it was primed, it worked great. The scraper isn&#x27;t anything fancy, but it gets the job done. My only complaint is the stamper head pops out of the stamper pretty easily, but it goes right back no problem. It just gets a little annoying. I would recommend purchasing this stamper.</li>
    <li> It was difficult to transfer the image from the stamper to the nail. You have to make several attempts before you can get most of the image on your nail.</li>
    <li> Great squishy stamper.  I gave it a little buff and it works amazing.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase :)  Having a great time trying out new designs on my nails.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
    <li> This is made of the poorest quality product.  The scraper is just cardboard and not even worth using.  The stamper pulls apart.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Images cover the entire nail without the mead for rolling the stamper.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by this stamper.  It has been primer multiple times are still has yet to work well for me.  I was hoping it was going to be a little larger than it was.  Maybe I can get this one to eventually pick complete images.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m new to stamping and I was nervous to order this stamper because of some reviews but I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase. After I primed the stamper it worked beautifully. It&#x27;s deff a great stamper and worth it  I did order a konad stamper that I&#x27;m waiting for so I&#x27;ll have something to compare it to soon .....</li>
    <li> This stamper get a ton of hype and honestly I have no idea why that is the case.  I have already found plenty of other stampers that far far out perform this product before even purchasing it.  However because women kept going on and on about this stamper being so excellent I felt I had to purchase it for the sake of knowledge and experience.  After all that&#x27;s what my blog is all about.  I&#x27;ve been stamping for 9 years so I want to always be open minded and keep an eye out for great products.  There are some issues however with this stamper that were apparent from the minute I opened it up.  1.  It&#x27;s tiny.  The pad is so small that it would fit the nails only of someone who had extremely short nails or for women who enjoy restamping  which many of us do not.  If you have long nails this is a no go.  Any image sized 1.5 x 2.0 cm and greater will not fit onto this pad.  2.  Its a squishy firm stamper - period.  It is not extremely soft nor is it extremely malleable.  If you have c-curves this product will not accommodate you i.e you will be left with bald patches along the sides of your nails.  The description of this product having now tried it is laughable.  When you finally touch a stamper that is super soft and squishy you will realize how far off this description is.  Messy Mansion, current WInstonia Store, AliExpress, and MoYou London offer stampers that are far softer by comparison.    3. The price of this one stamper is woefully overpriced.  I paid for it because I really wanted to compare it to other products on the market however Wintonia Store offers a softer multicolored package of stampers with a double ended XL stamper. You can get an actual marshmallow stamper with 2 pads for $8 from Messy Mansion.  You can get an entire set of 5 squishy soft stampers from Wintonia Store for roughly $10 along with a larger holder and also larger pads i.e. the standard XL size.  4. The stamper isn&#x27;t anything special.  Its a little below average.  You could also use a Starbucks gift card or any clubcard given to you as a scraper and it would more than adequately take the place of this scaper.  5. Bad for decaling because it&#x27;s so small so likely you will not get a large enough image to actually decal over your entire nail.  6. This stamper like every squishy firm I&#x27;ve acquired needs priming or it will not work as well as you want it too or not at all. There is nothing wrong with priming many stampers require it, but it bothers me to see Pueen describes this product as not needing it and working right out of the package.  In summation, its a waste of your money to purchase this product because as you continue stamping you will see that there is a wider array and better products out there that will over you more bang for your buck. If you don&#x27;t believe me head on over to my blog where I have a huge list of stampers available on the market that rival this one.</li>
    <li> It works great thank you so much</li>
    <li> The scraper is a hard plastic card. The stamper itself is very small, about 2 inches in length (intent of photo is to reflect length). The stamper did not pick up any of the images, I lightly filed it (&amp; filed it more when it did not make a difference) I also cleansed it with alcohol &amp; acetone- It just did not work. Very unhappy with the product.</li>
    <li> These tools are very good.  I am having, for the most part, very good luck with both the stamper and the scraper.  It has been suggested to me to  buy different stampers to get a feel for different brands, which I plan to do, also.  There were a couple of designs I had to redo several times from plate to stamper, but after that, it worked great with terrific results.  Only thing I would say about the scraper, if you clean it with acetone, as I did, the paint comes off.  The manufacturer could just eliminate the painted part on the scraper side and it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I have a black one for XL plates but thought this was cute to go with my new Pueen cases. Pink is so hot. Thanks Pueen, keep expanding!</li>
    <li> I must say I expected a better stamper its ok its a bit small but that isn&#x27;t too bad problem is the white silicon part doesn&#x27;t always pick up the image tried lots of methods to get it to stamp and believe me I have red angel plates , pueen, konad, cheeky mash..etc and still no luck....pueen plates are great just not the stamper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;I have had this stamper for like a year and never worked however three days ago I got it out of the drawer and got the white squishy thing out n rubbed it between my hands the way you would if you are cold,filed it,cleaned it with acetone till most of the shine was gone and then on a surface similar to that of children playground fisher price (my laptop lap holder) I rubbed it and now it works perfect.try it out you got nothing to loose.</li>
    <li> I was supposed to receive a stamper with it and I only got a scraper.  Terrible product</li>
    <li> Perfect for a newbie!  You will need to lightly prep it with a buffer, but it is amazing after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scraper is perfect, stamper is soft and squishy, and handle is comfy.  I would buy more!</li>
    <li> Squishy firm, good reliable stamper.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers are correct... This stamper sucks. it&#x27;s like those sticky things you can get in a gumball machine. It&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t work at all, but you can&#x27;t even prime it properly without it starting to tear. If you want squishy, go for one of those black, double-ended things, that you can probably get on here, but cheaper on ebay. Those are great.</li>
    <li> This stamper looks to be in between the konad stamper and the XL squishy stamper.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t  had the chance to try it yet, but will soon.</li>
    <li> This is Really bad quality!!! And where&#x27;s scaper!!!! You for got to put it in the package?&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> Work well with metal design plates. Just move quickly.</li>
    <li> is a bit too squishy to work properly</li>
    <li> This is the first stamper set I&#x27;ve purchased &amp; it&#x27;s just alright.  On my first try, I couldn&#x27;t get the image from the plate to stick to the stamper.  I had to Google tips on how to get the image to stick (e.g. rubbing the stamper with an emery board, washing it with dish soap), then I finally got it to work.  I&#x27;ve found I still need to use these tips from time to time in order to get the image to stick.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this stamper. It wasn&#x27;t something I could just use right out of the package though. I had to experiment to get it to work just right. Helpful hint: Put cotton beneath the stamper part so it stamps more thoroughly. After I got it set up it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> The stamper won&#x27;t pick up a single bit of polish.  The scraper actually came BENT.  How do I get a replacement for that?  I didn&#x27;t pay to receive a damaged item....</li>
    <li> the stamp does not pick up the image :(</li>
    <li> great for short nails !</li>
    <li> FAN-TAS-TIC.  Works very well.  No head prepping needed.</li>
    <li> The scraper card works great, and doesn&#x27;t scratch my plates like the metal one I used to use. The stamper, however, is basically junk, and I have been using an older one instead of it. As a few other reviews have pointed out, the silicone slips out of its plastic casing constantly, and is a bit too squishy to work properly, in addition to collecting lint and fuzz like mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I originally bought it for the stamper, and can&#x27;t use that, it&#x27;s been pretty useless to me. If you have one of those fake credit cards that they send you with credit offers--the plastic, not the cardboard ones--that thing will work just as well as this scraper, and credit companies send them to you for free. If you want a specialized scraper, though, this one is good; just know that you&#x27;re paying for the plastic card and may as well throw away the stamper.</li>
    <li> I am brand spankin&#x27; new to stamping and my first impression of this stamper is that it&#x27;s definitely cheaply made - not worth over 5 dollars. Like other reviews say, the white part comes out, which seems silly… Being new to stamping, it&#x27;s been an okay stamper for me - not awesome, but then again, I&#x27;m a newbie. I went ahead and ordered the Konad stamper that I see used in a lot of videos. So, we&#x27;ll see if that one&#x27;s better… If this stamper was $2 or $3, I&#x27;d say definitely try it out. But I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth $5+ dollars.</li>
    <li> I do love this stamper but I will admit I was frustrated at first and it&#x27;s b/c when you open it you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s shiney and doesn&#x27;t pick anything up. Then I remembered hearing that if you buff it with a nail file they work better. So I did that and it worked great! So that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars b/c you gotta do a little work but I love that it&#x27;s squishy and also it came with a plastic scraper which is good cuz metal ones scrape your plates so overall I&#x27;m impressed!!</li>
    <li> Had to prime this stamped but once I did it was excellent! Not using acetone or nail polish remover for clean up either, I&#x27;m using a lint roller, I am quite pleased at how well it works.</li>
    <li> This stamper set arrived quickly but the original packaging had obviously been opened and taped back together with Scotch tape. The silicon pad is not glued into (or attached in any way) to the pink plastic handle, so it continuously falls out. Although this is my first stamper purchase, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that I was sent an item of poor quality and questionable origin. Look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Stamp doesn&#x27;t work at all. Would not recommend or buy this product again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all. First time I used it the dang squishy part fell out, that&#x27;s pretty much the whole product. It doesn&#x27;t pick up the design very well either. Waist of five bucks</li>
    <li> I thought i was getting a stamper like in the picture....all i got was a piece of rubber that wont fit any of my stampers.Do u have to buy the pink part separate ?</li>
    <li> This is my first time stamping and from my amateur&#x27;s point of view, this  stamper does a really good job of transferring the images.  My only gripe is that the slightest touch of the stamp pad results in it falling off the holder.  The scraper worked beautifully.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stamper.It picks up the images so beautifully. I didnt have to prime it even.Its a soft squishy stamper with a little bit of a sticky touch.I highly recommend it.LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;The scraper is made of plastic and works amazingly well too.</li>
    <li> tricky to use, I have several different stampers and this one requires multiple trys to get a nice transfer.</li>
    <li> This is the first stamper I&#x27;ve ever bought... I did some research and it seemed like a good price so I went for it. At first I struggled... A lot. Then I remembered reading not to push too hard and I found a bit more success. Then after following the advice of a user below I filed it... Just a little bit and it made the world of a difference. I went from picking up fragments of an image to clear and precise stamps! I still need to work on the speed of this whole process but as a whole in very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I order this Thursday morning and received it the next day, I must say that this is by far my new favorite stamper. It is sticky and super soft. I did have to prime it with a magic eraser. I&#x27;m so happy that I bought this and I will buy this again</li>
    <li> My daughter Sarah uses this every day....</li>
    <li> Stamper does not work, scraper is good</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get the stamper to work . I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars but it took me two weeks to get it to work!  I first cleaned it with acetone, of course don&#x27;t do this.  Then I tried various remedies I saw on the web... I cleaned it with a lint brush... didn&#x27;t work.  I tried lightly sanding the shine off with a nail file... didn&#x27;t work.  I tried cleaning it with scotch tape... didn&#x27;t work.  Finally, after I saw it working in yet another nail art video, I tried cleaning it with masking tape AND tapping it lightly on the plate.  No rolling, no pressure, just down and up and OMG IT WORKED!  Now it works every time.  Woohoo!  Hopefully you get yours to work sooner than I did.  :)</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this more stars! I was having very little success getting images to stamp on my nails, and I didn&#x27;t know if it was the polish, the stamper, or me.  Trust me, it&#x27;s the stamper!  This super soft stamper is the best!  Once I purchased the squishy stamper, I immediately started stamping away on my nails.  I can use different polishes, too!  You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this.</li>
    <li> My scraper didn&#x27;t look anything like this one in the picture.  Stamper was a lot smaller than I had anticipated, and I too do not like how the white rubber part comes out easily from the base.  It&#x27;s just ok.  The konad brand stamper is the one I reach for as it does a much better job at picking up the polish and transferring onto the nail.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. I have to prime it to make it pick up the image. The stamper is white so i could hardly see and stamp the white pattern nicely. I recommend CICI&amp;SISI stamper kit, they are made of metal with great finish. They also come with 2 rubber heads in grey and white and one scraper. Cost only about $1 more than this stamper but they have way better quality.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m new in the stamping technique but this stamp doesn&#x27;t seen to work.  You need such amount of nail polish to have the figure &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; in the stamper and... as you can imagine that won&#x27;t work because the figure is just a nail blot. When you clean the polish from the plate it&#x27;s imposible to have the pattern in the stamper Then... the remover.... that doesn&#x27;t remove the nail in a &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; way.... so again it&#x27;s imposible either way to have the pattern in the stamper I bought a bundle in a local store that looks poor quality but I liked the plates.... the remover is excelent and the stamp too and I paid less that $5. There is something that caught my attention, the material from the bundle stamper and this one is different I guess that affects the printing....  I tried everything to make this work and nothing! I took the advices of different reviewers but well this just doesn&#x27;t work for me..... I think my technique is not so terrible as with the other stamper I was able to take the patterns and stamp them in my nails.....  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several stampers now (Konad, Wistonia, 2 from Borne Pretty)&lt;br /&gt;I think this one is my favorite so far.&lt;br /&gt;Wistonia would be better if you need an XL stamper but this one is the winner most of the time. Watch videos online for tips on using it and caring for it.</li>
    <li> A lot of people complain that the stamper does not transfer (or pick up) the nail polish but as long as you primed the stamper ahead of time, it should work.  Upon receiving the stamper, it was very shiny and did NOT pick up any nail polish at all.  However, I primed it A LOT.  To prime squishy nail stampers, you can either use strong acetone or a buffer.  Usually 2-3 times works but for this brand I had to go the extra mile and prime it 5-6 times.  Rating a 3 because it is cheaply made and the squishy part falls out, but it works fine.  Spend a little more for a better brand.</li>
    <li> The stamper works pretty well, but did not come with a scraper.</li>
    <li> The polish print will not stick sponge at all. Did not work at all.</li>
    <li> I probably would have loved this if I could get it to work. : / I use the scraper, but the stamper? Forget it! I tried everything I could to prime it, no dice. It&#x27;s my first squishy stamper, and I was really looking forward to it... Oh well. At least it was cheap.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this stamper.  That excitement quickly dissipated when it came.  It had a gross looking rust colored blob of something that was embedded in the silicone.  There was no way to remove it since it was deeply embedded as if it happened during manufacturing.  On top of that, I could not keep the silicone piece in the holder.  It should fit snugly.  Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> But once it picks up, it works like a CHARM! I used it today with a PUEEN plate, here is a link to the photo of the stamping I did: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using the metal scraper as the metal scrapers scratch plates, wish they had sold this item with a plastic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped way fast along with my HK phone case and PUEEN plate set.</li>
    <li> I also have the problem about the white part popping off but I&#x27;m sure I could glue it in the base if it gets too annoying. I also found that taking a nail file to it helped pick up the images better. Looks like they listened to other reviewers because my scraper isn&#x27;t metal or hard plastic, it&#x27;s like a credit card which I&#x27;ve heard works the best and doesn&#x27;t scratch the plate - after using it, I agree. Even though the stamper is small, that is fine with me because my nails can only fit a small portion of an XL image anyway. Overall I&#x27;m really happy with it!</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!!!! Don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfectly squishy. I&#x27;ve never stamped before and I am so glad I got this stamper. Very happy with my choice!</li>
    <li> The stamper itself isn&#x27;t bad- it&#x27;s nice and soft, and holds the design well after it was primed, but as someone else mentioned, the handle is entirely hollow, and it has a tendency to fall out and shift around as a result.  I took an earlier reviewer&#x27;s advice and took the stamp out to put a nickel under it before replacing.  Once that was done, it worked like a charm.  And, the added weight at the top made the balance a bit better.  I have no complaints now (but that really shouldn&#x27;t have been needed just to get it to work).&lt;br /&gt;The scraper is great, though.  It&#x27;s made of the same plastic as a credit card or gift card. Much nicer than the metal edge kind.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t necessarily bad to say but the scraper is a little bit flimsy and the Stamper is very soft I had a hard time picking up and transferring the polish so please don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re get all Konad  stamper this is very different</li>
    <li> The squishy white part fell out of the pink holder and this would NOT pick up a single image.  I didn&#x27;t use any nail polish remover like directed and I&#x27;m really disappointed.  I have a stamper from another basic intro kit that worked.  Will be writing the company.</li>
    <li> Great nail stamper. The scraper is plastic so it won&#x27;t damage nail stamping plates. The stamper is very soft flexible. It can be removed from the handle. However, no directions are included so I would suggest reading up on nail stamping techniques before stamping. I&#x27;ve read that some people file the stamper but I didn&#x27;t need to with this particular stamper.</li>
    <li> This is a decent stamper. I use it sometimes for really intricate stamps or if I&#x27;m having trouble getting a full roll on a stamp. My nails have a strong C curve.&lt;br /&gt;My issue with this stamper is that it needs to be primed almost every time you use it or it won&#x27;t work. The little stamper pad doesn&#x27;t fit snug into the stamper and it has a tendency to pop out when you stamp,  making you have to start over. I have tried to rig it and glue it in to no avail. The handle also could be longer, as it would give better control when stamper.&lt;br /&gt;I still use this stamper but it&#x27;s definitely not my first choice stamper.  The scraper is decent.</li>
    <li> like a toy suppose to have metal on scraper but doesnt have no idea how it works gave it away to kids</li>
    <li> Buy the konad. This ones not easily transferred and cheaply made.</li>
    <li> The stamper works perfectly. I just need to order a stamper that has a dark surface for when I use the lighter colors....it doesn&#x27;t show up on the white. Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all. For as much as I pressed hard on the plate design, it didn&#x27;t come on the stamper. The plastic one worked better than this one.</li>
    <li> If I could give it negative stars I would. First of all my order came with a scraper that was made out of material that&#x27;s similar to a thick business card, not the one pictured. No big deal scraper worked just fine. The stamper on the other hand won&#x27;t even pick up the polish off the plate. I tried and tried and tried and tried, over and over and over again! The polish from the plate transferred perfectly onto my actual finger (I used my fingertip as a &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; to see if maybe the polish was just too dry and that&#x27;s why it wasn&#x27;t picking it up but the design but looked fine on my finger) so the stamper is the problem.  This product is defective and Amazon should pull it off the website!!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this purchase/ taking up stamping again. I thought the idea of a card swiper was genius since the metal ones always scratched the plates. However, the stamper itself is too squishy to pick up the images properly, in my opinion. When I took it out of the package, there was a little piece of lint on it &amp; when I went to wipe it off, the whole rubber piece fell out &amp; wasn&#x27;t secured in any way. It&#x27;s also difficult to keep clean. I definitely love the card idea, but I&#x27;ll need to get a different stamper. Side note: None of my OPI colors would transfer, but the Sally Hansen insta-dri polishes will.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really transfer....</li>
    <li> I do not like this item at all. The color doesn&#x27;t stay correctly on it &amp; you can barely see the patterns. The stamper falls off. I find it to be a waste of money &amp; a poorly made product. I added one star only because I couldn&#x27;t submit my comment with adding it. If that weren&#x27;t the case it would have zero stars from me.</li>
    <li> I own multiple stampers and this one is definitely not the bets but also not the worst......It&#x27;s small and easy to hold and I do like white stamping pod more than other color.....but this stamping pad is really soft and sticky...I got a lot of hair on it just for putting it on the table (I have cats) and the picture is somewhat confusing....the pink tag that says Pueen, is just a paper tag....not a scraper…..so pretty much all I got for the price is a tiny little stamper that doesn’t always work….totally not worth the price....there&#x27;s some pics of the stamper and one other stamper I bought...you can see that the other one has stamping pas that are silicon and it picks up images way better than this one….sorry about the cigarette box...I have to have something in the picture for my camera to focus on….</li>
    <li> READ THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION BEFORE PURCHASING! The squishy part is supposed to come out and can be replaced with a new one after being used for a while. I thought it didn&#x27;t work but read the description later and it said it needs to me &amp;#34;filed&amp;#34; (or primed) first. Looked it up on YouTube and it seemed like a lot of effort and it might not even work still. Glad I had an old one a friend bought for me years ago that didn&#x27;t need to be primed or filed. The scrapper thing is just a piece of cardboard.</li>
    <li> Super soft squishy part keeps coming off.</li>
    <li> The stamper is of a good quality. It likes to pop out when you are pulling your imagine. The scraper is great. It doesn&#x27;t scratch your products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used a stamper before. I think the main things are to prep first and to realize that you don&#x27;t need to use much pressure in either scraping or transfer to the stamper.  The scraper is fine, but I prefer a credit card because of the thickness.  It helps to watch YouTube videos on both prepping your stamper and the stamping process.  Once I lightened up on the pressure, everything worked great.</li>
    <li> Love this stamper.  I have several scampers and this one is my favorite!</li>
    <li> The squishy works SO much better from all the other stampers I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> This product does not do what it is supposed to do.  Rubber comes off easily and it doesn&#x27;t stamp the pattern</li>
    <li> I consider myself a advanced stamper. Not pro but not intermediate. I am obsessed with this stamper! I love it! I am now able to successfully use my french tip images. I love that this is not too squishy like to XL stampers. I struggle with those because of the akward holder. This holder of the squishy stamper is perfect! I do not use the scraper because I do not like my plates being scratched but I do love the stamper!! Five stars all the way!!!</li>
    <li> Works great better  then the rubber one I had.</li>
    <li> the stamp does not work</li>
    <li> Very bad product dose not work at all east of money wish I could it back I wouldn&#x27;t even give it 1 star</li>
    <li> The stamper did not work at all! It didn&#x27;t help filling it first. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was so excited  to get home only to open it to find that the stamper was missing the white part and was floating around the box not even in the packaging. Along with the white part missing the scrapper wasn&#x27;t even included and there was a used candy wrapper in the box. I am super disappointed  and even more unimpressed.</li>
    <li> I really like this stamper and scraper card. I had to prime the stamper a bit by filing it just a little. Once I figured that out by googling tips on stamping then I was set. This stamper picks up the images perfectly and the swishy stamper covers up my whole nail. I did my sisters nails also and hers are double my length and I learned to just kind of roll the stamper upwards after I&#x27;ve pressed it onto her nail. If I missed a spot on top I just picked up another small design and stamped it again.</li>
    <li> This stamper works ok after a little bit of practice. My problem is that the white pad is not glued or secured in any way so it just pops out of the little handle is I try to wipe it off. I&#x27;ll probably end up fixing it myself with some super glue.&lt;br /&gt;It is also a pretty small stamper, I was a little surprised when it showed up at how small it is. It&#x27;s just barely big enough to cover a thumb nail if you get it on right.</li>
    <li> This stamp felt a little flimsy, if only because the damn rubber bit popped out of the pink plastic way too easily. I do love the indented grips on the side, which made stamping a bit easier. I used a (glass) nail file to file down the surface, since it was a bit too smooth and didn&#x27;t pick up the stamping designs too easily at first. The stamp itself also picks up dust really easily, but a quick swipe with some polish remover cleans it off nicely.</li>
    <li> Got this stamper together with Pueen Love Elements plates, and surprisingly it worked on my second try after I clean plates and stamper with acetone nail polish remover, using the simplest old nail polish I had. Delivered in one week, all as I expected. The only thing - yes, the white thing sometimes fall out. But I am happy with my purchase anyway, thank you Pueen and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Good stamp.  You do have to prime your stamp by filing it with a nail file and then cleaning it off with a polish remover in order for it to work properly.  It was great when I did my daughter&#x27;s nails and then when I did mine I found that it did not want to work for me, so I had to prime it again and after that it began to pick up the polish and stamp again.  I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to roll the stamp onto my fingernail beds, but when I did my toes I did roll some for I do have very large toenail beds.  It is also very comfortable to stamp with for the pad is nice and soft like a marshmallow.  Be mindful the pad does fall out which can be a drag, but that is because those pads are replaceable.  So as long as you can remember to prime this stamper periodically then it may be the stamper for you.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It shipped quickly, but the rubber portion of the stamp was not properly glued into the plastic portion of the stamper. Every time I clean my stamper, the whole rubber portion comes it of the plastic. It works, but I wish it was better quality.</li>
    <li> We are having trouble getting this silicone stamper to work. The polish doesn&#x27;t like to stick to it to transfer to the nail. We have a stamper from a different company and we have this one. The other stamper is a much better quality and seems like a different type of silicone. And works very easy. This one we are have no luck with. Comparing the two silicone side by side this one is almost like a thickened gel type substance. Solid but kind of squishy just like the title says. The stamper we own that works is not squishy. This one is just doesn&#x27;t seem right and definitely isn&#x27;t working for us.</li>
    <li> Crap crap crap doesn&#x27;t work to save my life. Doesn&#x27;t pick up nail polish no matter what I do... I even &amp;#34;filed the stamper&amp;#34; as someone suggested. Lordy I wish I could get my and all the wasted nail polish back</li>
    <li> Absolute worst stamper, I even primed the stamper and it still didn&#x27;t pick up the images.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get this to work. 2 other friends tried too with no success.</li>
    <li> The squishy stamper is easier to use, it is easier to grab the design. The scrapers do not scrape the metal on the plates. Nice idea!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to try this yet because the sponge was not attached to the handle when it arrived. I haven&#x27;t been able to find glue to keep it attached.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a stamper for a while now, because all my other ones have not been working so well. I am very pleased with this purchase and stamper. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> the white rubber piece comes out very easily, often when I am stamping, and I am gentle with it.  sigh.  It&#x27;s necessary to have this tool for stamping, and of all the reviews I read before purchasing the stamper, this was the best, so . . . The scraper is very small, and gets full of polish so easily, then gets sticky.. but I just keep cleaning it often.  They are both not very well made items, but they do work.  Hopefully they will come up with some better quality items for the purpose.</li>
    <li> I love this stamper.  It is very squishy and picked up images well.  I love pueen plates and stampers.</li>
    <li> Good little squishy stamper. The scraper is better than other plastic ones, but I still use an old gift card.</li>
    <li> I never loved a soft stamper so much before! It needs priming but after priming it works great. I lightly filed it with my nail filer and removed the dust with a piece of scotch tape and that was all it required to make this stamper work perfectly. Since, this stamper has a soft and squishy head, you can just press it on the nail. It will fit the curve of your nail and you will not have to roll it.This reduces the chances of smudging a design. Really loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper works great too. I am happy that its all plastic because I refrain from using metal scrapers on my plates. They scratch the plates. But since this scraper is made of plastic, it scrapes well without leaving any scratches on the plate. Looks beautiful too. Like a tiara or a crown! Love it!</li>
    <li> This stamper does not pick up fine details.  I keep priming it and am still having issues</li>
    <li> this stamper works great! I have another one (salon express) that I could not get to work for the life of me, so I almost gave up. Someone told me about this stamper and I gave it a shot. I love it. It picks images up perfectly and is super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got my first Pueen stamper which is truly super soft and squishy....so I decided to get 4 more for my sister and friends, but these new ones are not the same... these stampers are soft but not super soft like the first one...but they work fine anyway.</li>
    <li> thank you! item as described</li>
    <li> Best stamper ever I will buy more</li>
    <li> The stamper and scraper work pefectly! This coming from a newbie stamper!</li>
    <li> I love this very good</li>
    <li> I have never done nail stamping before so I ordered two stamps; this Pueen squishy one and a Konad medium hard one (same shape as this one but red stamper end). I like this Pueen one way better! It&#x27;s easier to stamp because it&#x27;s squishy. It can distort the shape if you push too hard on one side, but overall I would definitely recommend this one over any other nail stamper.</li>
    <li> I was about to throw this stamper away and write a terrible review, but learned the priming technique from other reviews. Works MUCH better now. Still gave it a 3 because I feel that those instructions should have been written on the package somewhere. Almost lost the silicone piece since it is not attached. Kind of annoying. The scraper is good! Stamper is a nice size for nails. Overall, it&#x27;s an okay stamper, but will be looking for a better one soon.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical to purchase this stamper because of some of the other reviews I read, but this stamper is great. I am new to nail stamping and this is the first stamper I have purchased. I really like the fact that it is softer and more flexible. It allows me to smoothly transfer the design to my nails with ease. Please note that upon arrival, it has a shiny surface that needs to be gently buffed off with a medium to soft grit nail file in order for the polish to adhere properly to the stamper. I have also noticed it seems a bit tacky, which is great also to have the print stick, but will collect dust and debris easily. My solution is to keep a lint roller nearby. It works wonders. After each stamp application, just dab the stamper head onto the lint roller and all the debris come right off and it&#x27;s ready for the next application. The stamper has a white pad, so it is not easy to see if using white polish. Overall, this is a great product and I would recommend this to anyone just starting out with nail stamping or for an experienced stamper.</li>
    <li> I just received this today. It is much smaller then it looks in the picture. I expected it to be around the same size as the Winstonia stamper. It wasn&#x27;t cheap either with the shipping it came to $10.73. I am very disappointed....it&#x27;s so small it looks like a toy stamper!</li>
    <li> iv tried three different nail polishes and the sponge won&#x27;t even pick it up or just picks up parts of it</li>
    <li> Really small but perfect for stamping! !</li>
    <li> i found that i had to prime it for it to pick up the design a bit better.  You just have to rub or clean it with non acetone nail remover till the shine is off.  That worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;This may sound a little weird but i find that this stamper has a nice scent to it.. not that it matters at all.  Good stamper over all.  and the scraper is like cardboard - not bad at all and I like best about it is that it is small enough to where it is more comfortable to use, at least i feel i have a better handle on it.  The scraper does not have a metal end to scrape, which prevents from scratching your plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Does not transfer image correctly</li>
    <li> I am using this stamper and scraper with Bundle Monster plates and polish and its not working. Now its a month later and the item is no longer eligible for return. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Love the softness of this stamper, and I like the scraper too!  My only issue is that the stamper head is a little small for longer nails,  Also, it takes getting used to applying the right amount of pressure to pick up stamping images.</li>
    <li> Maybe the ones i got the silicon was slightly smaller for the holder, it keep popping off when remove the design with tape.  Other wise it would have gotten 5 starts.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite for doing all over stamps. Meaning if I have a pattern which will cover my whole nail I will use this stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con: has trouble picking up stamp  -&lt;br /&gt;BUT IF --------&amp;#62; you keep a nail file square handing, before a session of stamping, lightly sand stamper before use and it will pick up stamps just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when I am just doing an accent stamp I still rather use the Konad stamper, unfortunatly the Konad stamper is very stiff (even their soft one) and struggles to get a patterns to the edge of my nail.</li>
    <li> You definitely need to buff the stamper, like the seller suggests. It requires a lighter hand when picking up the images compared to my salon express stamper but once I got the hang of it I love it so much more. I used an old gift card as my scraper before this product so their scraper is just what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I love using this stamper. Very good for stamoing</li>
    <li> I like the stamper. It is a nice size. Not big like the XL stampers and not tiny like some of the Konad stampers. It is easy to work with between my fingers. May be tricky for longer nails or decals, but I do like the softer texture to stamp with on my business length nails. The scraper is useless, I got better results with a used Olive Garden gift card. My daughter likes this stamper too! I did have to gently buff it. Don&#x27;t file it! If your stamper head is shiny, gently remove the shine with a buffer in a circular motion while turning your stamper. Then wipe with alcohol to remove the dust. If it is still shiny, buff gently and take a swipe of acetone when your done. It should pick up fine if your using a stamping polish or a thicker nail polish.</li>
    <li> Very nice unit, the only thing is the sticky sponge falls out sometimes. The easiest way to clean sticky sponge is to stick whatever is left on it to the roller that you clean your clothes with,..takes leftover polish from the sponge like a miracle</li>
    <li> Great fun for my daughter. Works well!</li>
    <li> Good , on Time, product as in the picture.</li>
    <li> This stamp is impossible! The white silicone tip constantly falls out, it gets really gooey when you clean it, and it will not transfer the paint. Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> Great stamper!  Very squishy! As all do,  it has to be primed before use and it takes practice to do stamping. ..</li>
</ol>
