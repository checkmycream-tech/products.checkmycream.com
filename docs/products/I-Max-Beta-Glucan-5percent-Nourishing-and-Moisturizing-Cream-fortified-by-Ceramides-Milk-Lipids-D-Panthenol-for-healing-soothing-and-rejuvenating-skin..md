      <li>It really hydrated my skin and made it feel smooth without leaving a greasy feeling on my face.</li>
      <li>I have also noticed, (when I used this during the day a few times), that it acts as a great primer for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just a dab goes far and it&#x27;s better to use at night before bed.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an affordable but effective product.</li>

      <li>Most moisturizing creams were tacky and greasy and a lot of them didnâ€™t hydrate my skin enough.</li>
      <li>At this point I&#x27;m more worried about bleeding because of shots I&#x27;ve been giving him daily for the blood clot.</li>
      <li>Applied Beta Glucan Cream and this is the first relief he had ever gotten.</li>
      <li>I am very confident it will work for other women just like me!</li>

      <li>It is white in color and upon application, you can really see the cream smooth out over your face.</li>
      <li>I then apply this to my skin and just relax in front of the television for around 30 minutes to let my skin really soak in the vitamins and cream.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Thankfully, my girlfriend introduced me to Beta Glucan Cream after complaining so much about my skin.</li>

      <li>last weekend I went to the beach with all of my friends to sunbathe and have some fun!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I sent it back because it just rolled off of my face.  I read other reviews that said that also, but I thought if I used it with my emu oil or other oils or lotions that it could work.  I wanted to like it because of the Beta Glucan ingredient in it.  I read the instructions and mixed it with my oil but it didn&#x27;t help.  I gave it a good try and then just gave up.  Maybe others will have better luck...  This just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. Highly recommended to other users..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beta Glucan as my daytime moisturizer for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a smoothing and softening of the texture. Usually my skin looks it worse by the end of a day, but since using Beta Glucan my skin still looks fairly healthy at day&#x27;s end. The product has no noticeable scent, is matte, and sits comfortably on the skin - can&#x27;t feel it. It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. My sun screen applies smoothly over top. The jar packaging could be considered a negative because of contamination, but I fill and use the small travel jar that comes with the product to avoid repeatedly dipping my fingers into the big jar. Over all I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty much amazing. This is the best my skin has ever been. My acne has almost completely disappeared. If I do get a blemish it&#x27;s very different from how they used to be. They&#x27;re very discrete and easy to get rid of. This product is like a blessing.</li>
    <li> So far, I like it. Wish it also contained retinol but the cream is fairly light - I&#x27;ve used beta glucan for 2 years.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cream that has the sole purpose of moisturizing, then look no further.  This one does an excellent job.  I use this as a night cream since my skin is very oily, and my skin feels great in the morning.  It comes with a mini spatula to prevent contamination, and it must be sealed-up as soon as you remove the product from the jar.  Extended exposure to air will cause the cream to form a &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34;.  It absorbs very well.  I have also noticed, (when I used this during the day a few times), that it acts as a great primer for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin like me, I would recommend only using this at night.</li>
    <li> Bought this on July 8 for my husband&#x27;s side effects from chemo. Mainly from weekly Erbitux. But Thursday night all around his neck and down his right arm became dark and sensitive. Like burnt. Friday morning the area around the jugular was swollen. Took him to the doctor, had sonogram and found he had a DVT (blood clot) in his port which is in his jugular. Doctor put him Lovenox daily shots which were not ready tell later that evening. We went home found the package from UPS. Applied Beta Glucan Cream and this is the first relief he had ever gotten. Then I went and picked up his shots for his DVT.&lt;br /&gt;Second reason we were glad we had this for our first aid kit! On the following Monday he was told he had a Ruptured Achilles Tendon and had to wear a boot. Just another sad side effect of chemo and antibiotics. The boot got caught under a garage door and he fell down and landed right on his face. Took the skin right off his nose and some of his forehead. He also scabbed up his knuckles and a knee. At this point I&#x27;m more worried about bleeding because of shots I&#x27;ve been giving him daily for the blood clot. But we got him cleaned and once again used Beta Glucan Cream. In five days no scabs on nose. He said it kept it from hurting. Also the knee never came to a full blown bruise it stayed a light color. On day 7 the nose is healed and the knuckles which was the hardest to heal since they are opened all the time when using your hands, have very thin scabs now and don&#x27;t hurt as much. Same for the knee. I know this may not sound like miraculous healing to you but this is a man that has just come off of chemo and skin healing has not been happening since he started chemo in April. We have all kinds of expensive prescription gels and pills but so far we think this cream is helping with the Erbitux side effect. He had a rash so bad he was taken off of it for awhile. But is back on again this past Monday but at 20% less strong hopefully that and Beta Glucan Cream will make hima less scabby man. I&#x27;m halfway through my first jar and about to order our second one. Oh and he also used it on his face after he shaved. His face had broke out for the first time on Erbitux right before the doctor took him off of it.  Beta Glucan Cream to the rescue!</li>
    <li> BEST MOISTURIZER. I always have skin problems. It is pretty dry and sensitive, which can be aggravated when the weather is cold or windy. It made me always looking for a good moisturizing cream. Most moisturizing creams were tacky and greasy and a lot of them didnâ€™t hydrate my skin enough. I found out this beta Glucan Cream through Google search and purchased it from Amazon right away because its price is not like $100 or $200. I was so happy with this cream because it is never tacky or greasy but still hydrating my skin very well. And my skin is not sensitive anymore and the fine lines are obviously reduced after skin is moisturized. I cannot believe I could get this quality cream only for $36.00. Thank you, Amazon.&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Clogged pores and gave me acne, showed no benefits for acne scars and it smells bad. I bought a better product that works much better.</li>
    <li> I always suffer from skin problems. It is very sensitive and naturally dry which gets even worse when I started shaving my face. I have to shave quite often due to my job, so my skin is constantly irritated! As a young man, I didn&#x27;t know what to buy and use for these problems. I did not know much about the latest lotions and potions. I have used skin toners, lotions and even moisturizing creams, but none of these gave me any lasting moisture. Some toners and lotions were useless for my skin and some moisturizing creams were very tacky, greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, my girlfriend introduced me to Beta Glucan Cream after complaining so much about my skin. I use it twice a day now, once after shaving in the morning and then also before bed. I can honestly say that this cream has been a miracle! My skin feels healed and smooth and I wouldn&#x27;t even think about using anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and has become even more so since turning 30 at the beginning of this year. It is pretty difficult for me to find cream that does not bring me up in an allergy. I am not sure why this happens, but most creams end up leaving me with red and itchy skin, so it s very difficult for me to pick products for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to go for creams that have soothing properties, which can help my skin recover and also moisturize my dry skin, which is always feeling tight and uncomfortable. I know this is a lot to ask for and it has been difficult to find the right product for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;After looking on Amazon, I found this product and ordered straight away because it is a great price for 5% Beta Glucan Cream. I must say, this cream works wonders!! It has a lovely, light texture and I started to notice a difference very quickly! After 2 weeks of use, my dry skin had virtually disappeared! I was lucky to find this cream and I definitely recommend it to anybody with a problem similar to mine.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell.  Have been using for a couple weeks and now noticeable difference yet.  Feels nice on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Beta Glucan cream for about a month and it has worked wonders for my skin! It is so versatile and I can use it in the morning or night and also after I shave myself. The versatility and convenience of this cream is so cool and I love the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But last weekend I went to the beach with all of my friends to sunbathe and have some fun! We all made sure that we used sunscreen, but for some reason we were all burned! It was really hot that day, but this doesn&#x27;t usually happen! I was quite alarmed so I thought I would use Beta Glucan on it straight away with Vitamin C 21% serum because I know it is good for soothing and protecting the skin from sun! I tried to get my friends to use it also so they could let their skin heal, but they did not want to as they were using sunscreen. I guess I just wanted to find a solution fast because my skin is much more sensitive and darker than theirs, so I was a bit scared that I messed my skin up! But after using Beta Glucan and Vitamin C 21%, everybody noticed a difference on me! My skin recovered faster than the other girls and it was not dark, instead really light and clean looking which is great!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to start seeing results.  After just a week I ordered another jar in case they run out.  Take ceramides from lipowheat, hydrolyzed fish collagen type 1 (Swanson&#x27;s vitamins/Swanson&#x27;s brand for best price) &amp; vitamin c to boost great skin from the inside out.  Lypospheric C from Golden Tiger Lipids is cutting edge.  I am in my early sixties &amp; people frequently ask what I am using on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Using this cream to nurture &amp; improve your skin, and combining the use with Beauskin snail silky pore BB cream and Purminerals cream blush to enhance your look, will provide a healthy, glowing, beautifully perfected complexion.  I know I might sound like a seller hawking their wares, but truly I am a very satisfied buyer who is thrilled with the results and wants to pass it on.  I have fair/light skin and use natural beige in the BB cream and the color coy in the cream blush.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use to take very good care of my skin, until a few months ago. My friend told me my skin looks so rough and dry. After I shave, I can feel my skin very sensitive and even fragile. My friend recommend this cream to me. I refused it at first, thinking it would be really greasy or sticky. But it&#x27;s just the opposite: it&#x27;s silky and smooth. Now my skin looks and feels so much better than before!</li>
    <li> My skin was really in need of a moisturizer and using this product helped to soften and hydrate my dry skin. Sometimes certain properties of skin creams make me breakout terribly and I waste a lot of money on products that turn out to be very irritating. I&#x27;m happy I found this product. I&#x27;m not sure what this cream has that others don&#x27;t or even what the other creams that leave my skin looking very angry have in them that this company leaves out of the list of ingredients but whatever it is all I know is that this is one product that actually works for me. I usually use it twice a day and on some days only once and this seems to be working just fine. My skin just looks better and more refreshed, smooth and clear. I highly suggest it!</li>
    <li> My skin always has problems. It is very sensitive and naturally dry which gets even worse when I shave my face. I have to shave quite often due to the line of work I&#x27;m in, so my face is constantly irritated! Being a guy, it is pretty hard to find anything that works and I do not know much about the latest lotions and potions. I have tried shaving gels, skin toners, moisturizing lotions and even creams, most of which do not provide any lasting moisture, which is annoying! I find that toners are a waste of my time and most lotions and creams are too heavy on my skin due to being tacky and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very dry throughout the whole day, especially on days that I have had to shave. Sometimes it can be quite uncomfortable and I end up scratching my face, which makes it even worse!!&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, my girlfriend introduced me to Beta Glucan Cream after complaining so much about my skin. I use it twice a day now, once after shaving in the morning and then also before bed. I can honestly say that this cream has been a miracle! My skin feels healed and smooth and I wouldn&#x27;t dream of using anything else from now on</li>
    <li> I am not sure if other people use Beta Glucan the way that I do, but it definitely works for me, so I thought I would post it up with this review. I am familiar with Max Life’s products and have been buying various products for a while now, with complete satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do take good care of my skin, so I try and use a face mask each week. I use Beta Glucan and Lumina Serum to fully nourish and revive my skin. To do this, I take a bit of Beta Glucan out the jar with a spatula and mix it with Lumina Serum in a little pot. I then apply this to my skin and just relax in front of the television for around 30 minutes to let my skin really soak in the vitamins and cream. After washing this off, I then cream my face thoroughly with Beta Glucan before I go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of this are very powerful and you will notice how it tightens and lifts your skin! The antioxidants in the Lumina Serum restore and heal your skin, whilst the cream moisturizes it. The next day my skin looks and feels rejuvenated and baby soft! So that is my little secret into looking 10 years younger! I am very confident it will work for other women just like me!</li>
    <li> My wife is using it for 3 weeks, and wrinkles on her face skin is reduced. Also she had red skin under cold condition, but it also reduced. She will try it continuous &amp; will update result.</li>
    <li> was buying an iMax eyelash conditioner for my wife that I found on Amazon. But saw this moisturizer as well, and thought it since my wife is getting a gift I should get one too, and I really needed a great moisturizer. The thing is, I have had issues with my skin since I was a teenager including dryness and sensitivity, and now that I much older with getting some fine lines due to my dryness. My skin is noticeably worse during the evenings as it dries out, especially in windy and cold weather conditions. As my skin gets drier, I get uneven red patches and irritation. I contacted the seller about their Beta Glucan as I just wanted to check if they were actually suitable for my needs and they advised me that Beta Glucan is very good for moisturizing and to try their Vitamin C Serum as it is great for reducing fine wrinkles. This sounded perfect to me!&lt;br /&gt;Based on this advice and the reasonable price, I bought both products. I have been using the cream with a few drops of the Vitamin C Serum for about a month now and I have already noticed a change in my skin. I definitely have less wrinkles and my skin feel so much more moisturized! I don’t have issues with patchy and uncomfortable skin in the cold and windy evenings anymore either, and since it is moisturized I dont have the redness or irritation no more.&lt;br /&gt;I have spent a lot of money on products that were too heavy on my skin and weren’t effective in anyway. But this is a fantastic combination of products for anybody who is suffering from similar skin conditions like me!</li>
    <li> I’ve only recently become interested in Beta Glucan. It’s not one of the most commonly known compounds, but I’ve learned that it’s quite beneficial and is even a recommended part of a daily diet. The best thing about Beta Glucan is that it’s a great asset when it comes to immunity. This helps when it comes down to skin as well. The skin gains that extra protection and healing properties. I’ve noticed that my skin looks a lot healthier recently. I have a nice glow compared to my normally dull skin tone.</li>
    <li> The iMax line is a new staple in my beauty routine. This cream is thick and cream, and feels wonderful going on. It absorbs quickly, and for optimal results I add in a few drops of the EGF serum. This is thick enough that it acts as a primer that allows for smooth application of my foundation.</li>
    <li> The i Max Beta Glucan nourishing and moisturizing cream beats any expensive cream I have tried in the past. It really hydrated my skin and made it feel smooth without leaving a greasy feeling on my face. A little bit of the cream goes a long way. I like that you can even use this cream on top of my makeup. My husband loves to use this cream after he saves, I had to order one just for him. I am always satisfied with my products from IMAX.  I absolutely recommend this product for both men and woman.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the &#x27;perfect face cream&#x27; &amp; I think I found it! I tried the cream for several days &amp; realized that there is also a vitamin C serum that can be added to it &amp; quickly ordered it.  At first I thought it might be a bit too heavy (oily) but it soaks in completely leaving my skin super soft &amp; smooth. Vitamin C is known to even out skin tone so adding it is a plus!</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible.  I&#x27;ve paid like 4 times this amount for creams that didn&#x27;t do half of what this did.  My skin is smoother, fine lines are reduced, and stays moisturized all day.  My clients have even complimented me on how my skin glows.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing cream for an affordable price. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an affordable but effective product.</li>
    <li> I used this cream in combination with the Albumin &amp; Hyaluronic Acid Serum with great results. It&#x27;s a little thick but just a dab goes far and it&#x27;s better to use at night before bed. I&#x27;ve seen good results almost immediately. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect nourishing cream. I love it as it is not greasy and works. I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> Like this, very good 5% glucan cream.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this cream inadvertently. I tried the Glycolic patch test and it included a trial size of this cream. I loved this Beta Glucan so much I purchased the full size! To start off, the cream is the perfect consistency -- I&#x27;d say it is like a balm. It is white in color and upon application, you can really see the cream smooth out over your face. You can detect where you applied already and where you need to apply more. After a short while, I&#x27;d say a few seconds, the cream turns transparent and your face glistens a little bit. It does not feel heavy at all. Very good moisturizer. I also read that this has healing properties -- a plus for me since I do use peels and the argan oil I tried (not from MaxLife) really did not work well with my skin. So I can use this BG cream as an after-peel treatment. Overall, very pleased both with the customer service (they email at 10:00pm! -- who does that???) and the product. A+++.</li>
