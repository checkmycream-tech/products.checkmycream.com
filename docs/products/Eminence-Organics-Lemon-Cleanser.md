      <li>I absolutely love Eminence products, each and every one of them that I have purchased and will continue to purchase.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  </li>
      <li>love it thank you for the great product,  I  highly recommend this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>but I read all the great reviews and I love natural things for my skin since I seem to not be able to tolerate the hash chemically stuff that&#x27;s on the shelves in the stores.  </li>
      <li>so it is pretty good stuff for me to buy it again.</li>
      <li>I like this one because the scent is very light and it feels light on my skin, yet still moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This product has been perfect (no stinging or irritation to treated areas) and my face seems to even be healing faster than expected.</li>
      <li>This is the best hands down</li>
      <li>Might be too oily for some people, but it works fine for me.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance is light and not annoying.</li>
      <li>It is a gentle but effective cleanser.</li>
      <li>One pump and my face/neck feels and looks pleasantly cleansed but not dry after use,</li>
      <li>and my skin is calm again!</li>
      <li>If you need a squeaky clean feel this might not be fore you.  </li>
      <li>Lovely Lemon scent; goes on smoothly to remove any dirt and airborne by products; leaves your skin soft and silky; great for my sensitive skin; use just a little for great success - my Esthetician recommended this product -</li>
      <li>Plus I can gently remove my eye makeup, it works better for that than the specialty eye makeup removers.</li>
      <li>Gentle, safe, organic, smells nice and good value for my hard earned money.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is decent, but not my favorite.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>Great as a gentle cleanser but not deep cleaning .</li>
      <li>Although i&#x27;ve trid other organic brands this by far is the best!!</li>
      <li>I kind of like the idea that I can wash my face with the same thing I use to clean my wood floors.</li>
      <li>It does not have any bubbly action which I love but might but a deal breaker for someone else.  </li>
      <li>It is a very gentle cleanser, so my face never feels anywhere close to dry after I use it, which I love :)</li>
      <li>I do not feel overly dry after using it which is so great because I live in the desert.  </li>
      <li>Rinses clean and leaves my skin residue free and not tight.</li>
      <li>Its like a gentle lotion you massage onto your face and rinse clean.  </li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and is gentle on my skin which tends to be a bit dry (but I can experience an occasional pimple).</li>
      <li>Great for everyday!</li>
      <li>I have actually been alternating washing with this and with Dr. Bonners pure castille soap, and quite honestly, it works about as well.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is very gentle.  </li>
      <li>This light cleanser works wonders on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>First off--love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>If you use a lot of make up then maybe you will need to use those makeup remover towelettes first.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It goes on seamlessly and leaves my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it, but it seems gentle on my face.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove build up and makeup very well.</li>
      <li>Yummy lemon fragrance that is gentle and hydrating.</li>
      <li>It has a lemonish smell that nice but not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>This did not seem like the product I normally bought from my salon, my face stated breaking out after using this particular product.</li>
      <li>the color and smell are completely off!!</li>
      <li>For days when I feel I need more cleansing power I have a clairasonic that I will use with a little of this product and then rinse</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money you spend.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the spend - only</li>
      <li>I might try another &#x27;flavor&#x27; next time for fun.</li>
      <li>So I decided to ditch all that and try something new</li>
      <li>Avellino Esthetics in New City, NY 10956.  </li>
      <li>and it seems I just have sensitive skin to this particular product.</li>
      <li>I recently had several solar keratosis areas removed by a dermatologist using liquid nitrogen, and I was sent home with recommendation to use a mild cleanser on my face during the two-week healing process.</li>
      <li>This makes my skin feel clean and supple, without the usual dry pulling feeling you get from most facial cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was excited to see this on Amazon for half the price than what I by it for at my salon.</li>
      <li>My skin has been clear since I started using it months ago.</li>
      <li>Gentle cream clenser, has left my skin soft and glowing and I don&#x27;t break out at all.  </li>
      <li>My skin is a bit sensitive to this cleanser.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love the refreshing smell and the way it makes my skin feel! my favorite cleanser out there that I have tried!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m certain this is fake product. I was excited to see this on Amazon for half the price than what I by it for at my salon. As soon an I dispensed a drop I knew it was NOT the same! the color and smell are completely off!! WTF?!?</li>
    <li> Great product and great service!</li>
    <li> The cleanser is decent, but not my favorite. The scent is ok, it smells like lemon rinds. I have to make sure to use a makeup remover wipe to get off my face makeup before I wash my face with this, because I could noticeably see foundation still in my pores after just using the cleanser by itself. It is a very gentle cleanser, so my face never feels anywhere close to dry after I use it, which I love :)</li>
    <li> This light cleanser works wonders on my sensitive skin. Other cleansers typically dry my skin out over time, or I feel do not remove all of the dirt and make-up from my face but this one does. I even prefer this cleanser over Estee Lauder. My skin has been clear since I started using it months ago. It can, however, feel as if it leaves a slight residue behind so I recommend using it in combination with Eminence Rhubarb Scrub. Great combination of products! -Kate</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It smells delicious and works great. It doesn&#x27;t lather but just get over that and realize it doesn&#x27;t matter. This is the cheapest I found it for, last time I paid almost double this buying it from a spa.</li>
    <li> I have seen a dramatic improvement in my skin since I started using this product about 4 months ago. This is a reorder for me so it is pretty good stuff for me to buy it again. Fragrance is light and not annoying. Rinses clean and leaves my skin residue free and not tight.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for one year and while it cleans my skin from daily grind,  it leaves a moist feeling. All the Eminence products I have used are excellent. I use the ones for dry skin and it improved, no scaling in winter!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the different Eminence cleansers now.  I like this one because the scent is very light and it feels light on my skin, yet still moisturizing. My face feels great after I use it. Not greasy and not dry.  It is also organic and doesn&#x27;t contain nasty chemicals.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is that while it works for me, it might not be perfect for you. Everyone has different skin, so it takes some experimenting. This one works for me, but I would still like to find something that I like just as well for less cost. I have actually been alternating washing with this and with Dr. Bonners pure castille soap, and quite honestly, it works about as well. Might be too oily for some people, but it works fine for me.  I kind of like the idea that I can wash my face with the same thing I use to clean my wood floors. Gentle, safe, organic, smells nice and good value for my hard earned money.</li>
    <li> Luv the smell , wakes you up in the morning but at Night I need to add to  a stronger Cleaner for taking off makeup,</li>
    <li> love it thank you for the great product,  I  highly recommend this cleanser.  I will buy this item again ..</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove build up and makeup very well. Best suited as a light cleanser in the morning. It smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Yummy lemon fragrance that is gentle and hydrating. I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers and this is my favorite, your face will love it!</li>
    <li> My skin is a bit sensitive to this cleanser. I&#x27;m prone to break-outs when drinking citrus juices on a regular basis and this LEMON cleanser gave me the same reaction. I&#x27;m not saying the product is bad. It&#x27;s not. Eminence is the brand I&#x27;ve been using for years and have been completely happy with their products. I was curious to try this cleanser and it seems I just have sensitive skin to this particular product. I switched back to the milky cleanser and my skin is calm again!</li>
    <li> I had never used Eminence before but I read all the great reviews and I love natural things for my skin since I seem to not be able to tolerate the hash chemically stuff that&#x27;s on the shelves in the stores.  I was using Burts Bees facial cleanser but was getting a lot of acne and just felt that it wasn&#x27;t really helping.  I&#x27;m not blaming it because I know it was a combination of make ups and lotions with chemicals like demethicon.  So I decided to ditch all that and try something new so I bought this,  It does not have any bubbly action which I love but might but a deal breaker for someone else.  Its like a gentle lotion you massage onto your face and rinse clean.  If you need a squeaky clean feel this might not be fore you.  It does not strip away everything including your natural oils but I do feel my face is cleansed, and that&#x27;s what I like about it.  For days when I feel I need more cleansing power I have a clairasonic that I will use with a little of this product and then rinse and then I will rub a little on my face and rinse that off too.  After that I tone and put on some lotion.  I use an all natural mineral powder for make up and this is enough to remove it but I do use a wash cloth.  If you use a lot of make up then maybe you will need to use those makeup remover towelettes first. I do not feel overly dry after using it which is so great because I live in the desert.  It has a lemonish smell that nice but not overwhelming.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  I might try another &#x27;flavor&#x27; next time for fun.</li>
    <li> LOVE my Eminence face washes! The cremes are a bit greasy on my skin, but I swear by all the cleansers I&#x27;ve used. Washing my face becomes a sensual experience!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. It smells wonderful and is gentle on my skin which tends to be a bit dry (but I can experience an occasional pimple). My face always feels clean afterwards, and never irritated (which some harsh cleansers can do).</li>
    <li> First off--love this cleanser. But, I was disappointed to discover it is a cream cleanser (thought it was a liquid/gel type cleanser) as I wanted it for daily use with my Prosonic (electric rotating brush).  So, I was skeptical that it would be too thick for use with my Prosonic. Because the texture is a very, very fine cream, it does not clog my Prosonic whatsoever...I hardly realize it&#x27;s a cream cleanser!  One pump and my face/neck feels and looks pleasantly cleansed but not dry after use, and because of the wonderful lemon smell, my face feels rejuvenated.  I recently had several solar keratosis areas removed by a dermatologist using liquid nitrogen, and I was sent home with recommendation to use a mild cleanser on my face during the two-week healing process. This product has been perfect (no stinging or irritation to treated areas) and my face seems to even be healing faster than expected. This cleanser is perfect for not only for performance, but also for price point.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment - great price.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser . Leaves skin feeling moisterized &amp; the lemon fragrance is pleasant . Will always reorder this .</li>
    <li> It leaves a residue on your skin; not really good for an oily complexion.  Instead of using it as a face cleanser I use it to shave my legs.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I was introduced to it by a friend. Although i&#x27;ve trid other organic brands this by far is the best!! It&#x27;s worth the extra money you spend. Glad to see it&#x27;s offered by Amazon. Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Gentle cream clenser, has left my skin soft and glowing and I don&#x27;t break out at all.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have used the Coconut Milk Cleanser but decided to try this one for a change. While both are great products, I prefer the Lemon Cleanser. It goes on seamlessly and leaves my skin smooth and refreshed. Will definitely be purchasing it again in the future!</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser perfect in every way. It&#x27;s fresh lemon scent is delightful, and the ingredients are pure. Takes off my makeup efficiently and leaves my skin feeling wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this cleanser. I use it with my clairsonic daily. I thought it was a gel cleanser but it is is a cream.</li>
    <li> This did not seem like the product I normally bought from my salon, my face stated breaking out after using this particular product. I have been using Eminence for a while and never had a problem. I am assuming this is a knock off with inferior ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My esthetician uses the Eminence skincare line and I&#x27;ve loved everything she&#x27;s used on me.  This cleanser is very gentle.  I love the smell, too.  I ended up buying the professional size to use as body wash.  I&#x27;ve used it with my Clarisonic Pro (both face and body brushes) as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it. For some reason this batch is skunky, not fresh.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great for everyday!</li>
    <li> Love this product and arrival time</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, but it seems gentle on my face.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as natural as some of the other products.</li>
    <li> Great as a gentle cleanser but not deep cleaning . If your face gets dirty I suggest the stone crop face wash instead. Good Luck :-)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Eminence products, each and every one of them that I have purchased and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Lovely Lemon scent; goes on smoothly to remove any dirt and airborne by products; leaves your skin soft and silky; great for my sensitive skin; use just a little for great success - my Esthetician recommended this product - she uses Eminence products for my facial and is her Spa. Avellino Esthetics in New City, NY 10956.  Call for an appointment - you will not be disappointed. Truly amazing place and more importantly its owner!!!! CLP</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel clean and supple, without the usual dry pulling feeling you get from most facial cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;I used to feel the need to put moisturizer on as soon as I washed my face. After using this product I actually forgot one day to apply moisturizer. That has never happened for me. Plus I can gently remove my eye makeup, it works better for that than the specialty eye makeup removers. This bottle lasts a long time too!</li>
    <li> A deliciously scented, effective cleanser.</li>
    <li> This product is great because it really cleans your skin and birghtens it up.  I also like the scent - which is so refreshing.  Definitely worth the spend - only need a little to wash your face.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. I use it 3 times a day and I&#x27;d use it more often if I didn&#x27;t think it was just wasting it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It is a gentle but effective cleanser.</li>
    <li> Will never use another skin care line ever. This is the best hands down</li>
</ol>
