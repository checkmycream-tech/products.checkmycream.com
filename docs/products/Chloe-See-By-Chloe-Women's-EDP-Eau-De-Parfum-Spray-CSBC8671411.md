      <li>it smell amazing</li>
      <li>Not over powering, just a really nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>Really nice scent.</li>
      <li>Very refreshing smelling, not too strong and</li>
      <li>And, I don&#x27;t think any of See&#x27;s \\&quot;stages\\&quot; can hold a candle to any of those belonging to the original -  as measured by \\&quot;good smelling\\&quot;, since their notes aren&#x27;t comparable.  </li>
      <li>i love love love love love it !</li>
      <li>For many years I have been a fan of the original Chloe scent desinged under Karl Lagerfeld&#x27;s name when he was with the house of Chloe and have always loved the scent.  </li>
      <li>An interesting perfume.  </li>
      <li>I love that it is not overly floral.</li>
      <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon.</li>
      <li>Glad I did</li>
      <li>Like many reviews, I  got a sample from  a magazine add and</li>
      <li>It is just \\&quot;okay\\&quot; - not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love the scent with all of these accords and have gotten compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>I love this perfume and get compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
      <li>my favorite light scent!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Smells better than it did on the magazine strip.</li>
      <li>i will be sure to order from them again if it is available.</li>
      <li>I always loved this perfume on a friend of mine and I finally got some of my own.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to have found a companion frangrance to my long ago love, Chloe.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Light.</li>
      <li>Light, clean w/ a touch of floral.</li>
      <li>I love all of the Chloe fragrances but this by far has been a favorite.</li>
      <li>No stages of See to my nose would qualify as a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; \\&quot;beautiful\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent - sweet and musky -, maybe, but not \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try the real thing.</li>
      <li>The product arrived REALLY quickly and packaged well.</li>
      <li>This perfume by Chloe is a clean crisp unique scent.</li>
      <li>The difference to me(totally subjective) is that all of the individual predominant scents Chloe offers up throughout wear are all beautiful.</li>
      <li>Nice package, same as on the picture .</li>
      <li>It smells a bit different, much stronger but not in a good way.</li>
      <li>, I actually rub the paper on my wrist ( I know cheese but wanted to test my natural smell with the sample to see if it would be good chemistry)</li>
      <li>love the light fragrance, so I decided to order this for my every day active life.</li>
      <li>Shipment on time, scent slightly too strong for me, but still love it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for shipping it to me faster than the estimate delivery!</li>
      <li>My sister came to visit and had this perfume that she bought from Sephora, so I know exactly what the product should smell like.</li>
      <li>I prefer Chloe by Chloe - it is an elegantly clean scent and far stronger and it also has that really interesting quality of having different notes surface throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>The product was not broken.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of perfume on other people, but I often get headaches if I wear it myself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice balance of slightly sweet white flowers, and a bit of citrus and green scents.  </li>
      <li>My new signature scent!</li>
      <li>i highly recommend it</li>
      <li>The scent opens with top notes of bergamot and apple blossom, with a base of sandlewood and vanilla that gives a clean, soft, lightly floral, but very sublte fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Perfumes do smell differently depending on the person, so I always like to try it out first.</li>
      <li>It is light but long lasting.</li>
      <li>Kind of disappointed that I purchased this, should have just saved a bit more and bought it from Sephora or Neimans.</li>
      <li>Not too heavy, not too girly, but just right.</li>
      <li>so after a few minutes the small amount that I was able to rub on my wrist remain...</li>

    <li> This perfume by Chloe is a clean crisp unique scent. It smells great and I wear it everyday. Not over powering, just a really nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Saw this perfume in a magazine, had a side strip on a page and you could smell it there. It was amazing and ever since then I have been wanting to buy my own &amp;#34;See by Chloe&amp;#34;. Glad I did, I got a few compliments so far and it makes me happy. Very refreshing smelling, not too strong and I love that it is not overly floral. The only con that I have found is that it last for up to 8 hours and the scent slowly goes away. Thanks Amazon for shipping it to me faster than the estimate delivery! You guys rock!!!</li>
    <li> i love love love love love it ! great price ! i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Like many reviews, I  got a sample from  a magazine add and OH MY GOD....it smell amazing, I actually rub the paper on my wrist ( I know cheese but wanted to test my natural smell with the sample to see if it would be good chemistry) so after a few minutes the small amount that I was able to rub on my wrist remain...yes from the sample paper.&lt;br /&gt;I love the light fragrance, so I decided to order this for my every day active life. :-)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try the real thing. :-)&lt;br /&gt;Who knew I would find this wonderful gift in here. :-)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon.</li>

    <li> i was very happy with my purchase. especially since it saved me a bunch of money. the smell is delicious. i will be sure to order from them again if it is available. i might even look to see if they have other smells i wear.</li>
    <li> An interesting perfume.  The different notes do, in fact, surface at varying times during wear.  I prefer Chloe by Chloe - it is an elegantly clean scent and far stronger and it also has that really interesting quality of having different notes surface throughout the day.  The difference to me(totally subjective) is that all of the individual predominant scents Chloe offers up throughout wear are all beautiful. No stages of See to my nose would qualify as a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; \\&quot;beautiful\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent - sweet and musky -, maybe, but not \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  And, I don&#x27;t think any of See&#x27;s \\&quot;stages\\&quot; can hold a candle to any of those belonging to the original -  as measured by \\&quot;good smelling\\&quot;, since their notes aren&#x27;t comparable.  It is just \\&quot;okay\\&quot; - not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Really nice scent. Light.</li>
    <li> When I wear this perfume everyone asks what I am wearing. This is a great summer scent. It is light but long lasting. I love all of the Chloe fragrances but this by far has been a favorite.</li>
    <li> Smells better than it did on the magazine strip. Long-lasting scent. Light, clean w/ a touch of floral. Hint of musk makes it perfectly mysterious.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of perfume on other people, but I often get headaches if I wear it myself. This fragrance does not give me a headache at all. I love it. It&#x27;s feminine, but not overly floral. LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Fell in luv with the scent the moment I opened the magazine it was advertised in! My new signature scent!</li>
    <li> Shipment on time, scent slightly too strong for me, but still love it.Nice package, same as on the picture . Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume after I had a chance to use a sample, so I already knew I was a fan of the scent on me. Perfumes do smell differently depending on the person, so I always like to try it out first. The product arrived REALLY quickly and packaged well. If you like the scent, then definitely purchase.</li>
    <li> I always loved this perfume on a friend of mine and I finally got some of my own.  I love this perfume and get compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
    <li> For many years I have been a fan of the original Chloe scent desinged under Karl Lagerfeld&#x27;s name when he was with the house of Chloe and have always loved the scent.  Although Lagerfeld has long moved on to Chanel, I thought I would like to experience See By Chloe under the perfumer Michael Almairac.  The scent opens with top notes of bergamot and apple blossom, with a base of sandlewood and vanilla that gives a clean, soft, lightly floral, but very sublte fragrance.  I think there is a heart of jasmine in there.  I love the scent with all of these accords and have gotten compliments on it.  I guess I rated it with 4 stars instead of 5 as I think the jury is still out on its sillage (the waft or wake the scent leaves).  Maybe it&#x27;s that my nose has accustomed to the scent, or that the scent is ebbing and flowing and I don&#x27;t notice it.  Although the See line of apparel was designed to target a younger audience, I definitely feel this could be worn by a woman of any age.  It&#x27;s a lovely, clean smell and would be especially nice in the spring and summer. I am happy to have found a companion frangrance to my long ago love, Chloe.</li>
    <li> The product was not broken. it was good, and it shape to my house within a week. I was happy</li>
    <li> my favorite light scent!</li>
