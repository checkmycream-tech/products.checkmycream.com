      <li>I am happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>and maybe I will have a better opinion about it!!</li>
      <li>It was like magic!!     </li>

      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This eye cream is amazing.  </li>
      <li>i love the duality.  </li>
      <li>I had to thoroughly wash it off and thank goodness was able to reverse the unsightly affect of this avon eye lift.  </li>
      <li>Will purchase more from Amazon when needed.</li>
      <li>I have used this eye cream for many years.  </li>
      <li>but it has gotten better.  </li>
      <li>My skin is tighter, lines significantly softened, and it&#x27;s finally easy again to apply eye make-up.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s a very nice soothing under eye cream, it did nothing at all for the upper lid area lift, which is why I bought this product.</li>
      <li>The seller was very prompt in responding to my e-mails regarding delivery, and I must say upon receiving the product in the mail i was vey pleased with the packaging and expedient delivery.</li>
      <li>This is a very simple addition to the nightly routine and much more economically priced than many comparative products.</li>
      <li>I would not pay full price for this product, but if you can find it on sale, its worth it.</li>
      <li>and I believe the price is worth it.</li>
      <li>I also think the darkness has diminished, most likely because the skin is in overall better condition.</li>
      <li>I think this product works pretty well and would purchase it again.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the exact perfume.</li>
      <li>It definitely made my eyes look more refreshed</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the first that has helped my saggy, crinkled eyes.</li>
      <li>Avon Anew products are just plain good products.  </li>
      <li>[...]    &#x27; All of your AVON needs are available at the  Website above!   </li>
      <li>I use this product twice a day, and it really works.</li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t have to use much of it.</li>
      <li>My eyes are much brighter in appearance, and bags noticeably diminshed</li>
      <li>Expected much more.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Because a little goes a long way, I anticipate this being a great bang for the buck.</li>
      <li>brighter and more hydrated and even my \\&quot;terrible\\&quot; dark circles has diminished but I think that I am gonna use the whole jar</li>
      <li>&#x27; Check out the specials NEW every 2 weeks!</li>
      <li>In fact, I highly recommend any of the Avon Anew products.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and would puchase again from this seller.</li>
      <li>&#x27; Choose to have it shipped DIRECTLY to you!  </li>
      <li>For those of you not already aware, Avon does not permit its reps to sell products on such sites as Amazon or eBay.  </li>
      <li>I am 51 years old now, and my eyelids are still lifted.  </li>
      <li>Please be aware that buy purchasing Avon products from anywhere other than Avon or an authorized Avon Rep you may be purchasing goods that are stolen, counterfeit, damaged, or expired.    </li>
      <li>I had an upper blepharoplasty in the early 1990s.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it takes longer than 6wks, so I&#x27;ll keep using it, but ladies with this product you are really taking a chance on wasted money depending on how much \\&quot;lift\\&quot; you need to your upper eyelid.</li>
      <li>I went on to try other products which did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>After a few weeks of use, I could see the whole eyelid!</li>

<li> After a few weeks of use, I could see the whole eyelid!</li>
<li> I have been using this for more than half a year, never notice a slight difference, waste of money!</li>
<li> I had high hopes for this over and under the eye 2 in 1 cream/gel but shortly after application it aged my eyes by at least 10yrs.</li>
<li> You only need a little of the gel or cream each use, so it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t even get a slight lifting or tightening of any of the upper lid!!!</li>
<li> It was carefully packaged as it was a bottle of perfume.</li>
<li> This product does wonders, along with all of AVON&#x27;s other products.</li>
<li> &amp; I could feel my crows feet slowly diminishing &amp; getting smaller &amp; tighter.  </li>
<li> I looked like I was half asleep.    </li>
<li> Its pretty bad</li>
<li> As I got older (now 57) the situation got worse--sagging so bad you couldn&#x27;t see the lower half of the eyelid.</li>
<li> This product works well to keep your delicate skin around the eyes somewhat hydrated.  </li>
<li> a day after i got it  since it irritates my eyes, not a good eye cream for me.</li>
<li> After just 3 weeks of using this product, I have already seen results; specifically, the skin under my eyes (which is quite thin and often shows any signs of fatigue) has a brighter, healthier glow.</li>
<li> I must say i saw a dramatic decrease in my under eye circles.</li>
<li> So DISAPPOINTED in this AVON product, and now I will have to spend money on trying to find another product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing.  i love the duality.  however, the instructions came in another language so I had to do research to figure how to use the product correctly.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this item several months ago upon my quest for an eye cream that actually showed results. I must say i saw a dramatic decrease in my under eye circles. I went on to try other products which did absolutely nothing. So i decided to go back to the Anew eye lift. This is one product for puffiness and helps lift the lids that actually work.  The seller was very prompt in responding to my e-mails regarding delivery, and I must say upon receiving the product in the mail i was vey pleased with the packaging and expedient delivery. I highly recommend this product and would puchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this over and under the eye 2 in 1 cream/gel but shortly after application it aged my eyes by at least 10yrs. puffy, wrinkly and droopy. I had to thoroughly wash it off and thank goodness was able to reverse the unsightly affect of this avon eye lift.  I dont recommend this one.</li>
    <li> The product was shipped within 2 days of purchasing product on line. It was carefully packaged as it was a bottle of perfume. The price with shipping was still $35 cheaper than if I went to Macy&#x27;s and it&#x27;s the exact perfume. I am very pleased and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product does lift the upper eye area for me. The under eye area  still has some puffiness but it has gotten better.  I think this product works pretty well and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using a week, but this product has already taken 10 years off my appearance.  My skin is tighter, lines significantly softened, and it&#x27;s finally easy again to apply eye make-up.</li>
    <li> Avon Anew products are just plain good products.  I am happy with my purchase.  The price was reasonable. The delivery time was excellent.  Will purchase more from Amazon when needed.</li>
    <li> i have stopped using this product a day after i got it  since it irritates my eyes, not a good eye cream for me.</li>
    <li> This product works well to keep your delicate skin around the eyes somewhat hydrated.  Did nothing for any wrinkles.  I would not pay full price for this product, but if you can find it on sale, its worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Price is very reasonable and effects are awesome.  I also keep in the fridge for an extra soothing effect.  This product isn&#x27;t just for women, I know several men (including) myself who swear by this product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s a very nice soothing under eye cream, it did nothing at all for the upper lid area lift, which is why I bought this product. I even waited to make this review because I know it takes time for products to work, and your skin to absorb the nutrients. So DISAPPOINTED in this AVON product, and now I will have to spend money on trying to find another product. Maybe it takes longer than 6wks, so I&#x27;ll keep using it, but ladies with this product you are really taking a chance on wasted money depending on how much \\&quot;lift\\&quot; you need to your upper eyelid. If you expect immediate results then don&#x27;t bother. I didn&#x27;t even get a slight lifting or tightening of any of the upper lid!!!</li>
    <li> This product does wonders, along with all of AVON&#x27;s other products. AVON is a very reputable company, with 125 years of experience. You can trust their products!

    <li> This stuff gets in your eyes and hurts. Its pretty bad and I saw no improvements. Expected much more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for more than half a year, never notice a slight difference, waste of money! I will never buy this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the first that has helped my saggy, crinkled eyes. Love it!</li>
    <li> It definitely made my eyes look more refreshed &amp; I could feel my crows feet slowly diminishing &amp; getting smaller &amp; tighter.  I will definitely order this product again!</li>
    <li> Hi!  For those of you not already aware, Avon does not permit its reps to sell products on such sites as Amazon or eBay.  Please be aware that buy purchasing Avon products from anywhere other than Avon or an authorized Avon Rep you may be purchasing goods that are stolen, counterfeit, damaged, or expired.    Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been used this product for about three weeks now and I could noticed that my eyes looks brighter and more hydrated and even my \\&quot;terrible\\&quot; dark circles has diminished but I think that I am gonna use the whole jar and maybe I will have a better opinion about it!!</li>
    <li> I have a long-term sagging eyelid on one eye. As I got older (now 57) the situation got worse--sagging so bad you couldn&#x27;t see the lower half of the eyelid. I looked like I was half asleep.    Saw this at Avon site and decided to try it when it was on sale.  After a few weeks of use, I could see the whole eyelid! It was like magic!!     I&#x27;m only using the gel now on my upper lid and brow area (I have another brand of eye serum for under my eyes) and I believe the price is worth it. At Avon it&#x27;s about $30, so I check back from time to time and when it is on sale price, I stock up. You only need a little of the gel or cream each use, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> After just 3 weeks of using this product, I have already seen results; specifically, the skin under my eyes (which is quite thin and often shows any signs of fatigue) has a brighter, healthier glow. I also think the darkness has diminished, most likely because the skin is in overall better condition. This is a very simple addition to the nightly routine and much more economically priced than many comparative products. Because a little goes a long way, I anticipate this being a great bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is one of the best beauty products that I have ever used.  I had an upper blepharoplasty in the early 1990s.  I am 51 years old now, and my eyelids are still lifted.  I have been using this product for about 8 to 10 years.  It is inexpensive too!</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream for many years.  I am well into my 60s and have no lines around my eyes.  Might be genes, but I attribute it to using this eye cream morning and night.  I have encouraged my daughters (age group 30-40) to begin using this cream.  I highly recommend it.  In fact, I highly recommend any of the Avon Anew products.  (I do not sell Avon nor do I have any vested interest in promoting their products.)</li>
