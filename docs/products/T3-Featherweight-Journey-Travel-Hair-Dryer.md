      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I purchased this unit for a family member and it is a great fit.</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>but it did end up catching fire while I was using it.</li>
      <li>The folding mechanism works well, so it fits nicely in my carry-on bag.</li>
      <li>The popular saying, \\&quot;You get what you pay</li>

      <li>I am so glad I bought this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>However, when used at 220V I find that drying time is greater.</li>
      <li>You will need an adaptor but it has a voltage converter so it works much better than hairdryers that don&#x27;t have a voltage converter.  </li>
      <li>I would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full-size dryer for the price</li>
      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea of not having to use the dryer in the hotel room.</li>
      <li>I have a $20 hair drier that works better.</li>
      <li>I go - use it everday - very light weight and strong power</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t write a review when I first bought this item, but I can tell you I LOVED it.</li>
      <li>I loved this travel dryer when I first used it.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly powerful for its size!!</li>
      <li>Item works great so far.  </li>
      <li>I am a business traveler and this is so easy to pack and carry.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as strong.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t use this in lieu of my full size dryer because I love my light weight FHI Nano.</li>
      <li>dryer is fine.  </li>
      <li>The dryer work fine for about 10 months</li>
      <li>I have been a huge fan of the T3 line for years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought the T3 Journey Hair Dryer after hearing two friends say such great things about it and how it made their hair silky smooth afterwards.</li>
      <li>Honestly you can get a smaller lighter dryer which are even more rubbish but light?!</li>
      <li>Thus you cannot get original T3&#x27;s 2-year warranty.  </li>
      <li>However, I wish I had spent more money to invest in a more effective product -- perhaps the T3 Featherweight 2</li>
      <li>Super convenient to fit in carry on luggage.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>specially the air difussor...</li>
      <li>It  does not have a cool button</li>
      <li>I have a full sized chi hair dryer, which I like.  </li>
      <li>Not even close to the full size version of this dryer.</li>
      <li>advised me to return it and ask for full refund.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ended up using it full time at home too.</li>
      <li>It is extremely light and powerful.</li>
      <li>My hair always looks so beautiful after I have dried it with the T3.</li>
      <li>I actually think it&#x27;s better than the hairdryer I use at home!  </li>
      <li>so it is easy enough to stow, and it also comes with its own little cloth bag which is good to keep the cord from getting tangled up during transport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am so happy this hair dryer is light, well-functioned and totally enough for daily use and travel.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a powerful travel dryer, like the rest of T3 dryers.</li>
      <li>As far as dual voltage dryers go, this is one of the better ones.</li>
      <li>recommend it - worth the money</li>
      <li>T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size.</li>
      <li>It is light, small, cute and works ok apart from that...</li>
      <li>All the reviews were right on.</li>
      <li>This hairdrier is not as loud as many other but to me the size was more important.  </li>
      <li>Very good dryer for those who&#x27;s always on the go or even if you&#x27;re not and you want something light and small!!!</li>
      <li>I had the previous model and loved it.  </li>
      <li>The problem is it made a funny noise let out some smoke then stopped working.</li>
      <li>I have consistently used T3 hair dryers for perhaps 10 or so years.</li>
      <li>Glad I finally wised up!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just never even thought of ordering a higher end hair dryer.</li>
      <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>This lightweight dryer works quickly and is light enough to pack in suitcases.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost as powerful and heats up like a regular dryer, which is a huge plus for me.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a similar dryer that I could take with me when I traveled -- hotel dryers were ok, but I missed a better dry...</li>
      <li>I had problem with my full size dryer (not this travel size one), and the T3 Co, honored their warranty and fixed it.</li>
      <li>It comes with a black pocketed bag that you can store it in, which is also nice.   </li>
      <li>Have not taken it on a trip - it&#x27;s a bit large for that.</li>
      <li>You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume.</li>
      <li>I never realized that spending a little more on a hairdryer could be so worth it.</li>
      <li>My real Journey makes it feel like silk.</li>
      <li>I dont care about weight so much as performance.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>However this morning, I plugged it in ready to go and there was no response.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The dryer work fine for about 10 months but it did end up catching fire while I was using it. I think for the price it should last longer than 10  months.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel, since the hotel ones make my hair frizzy. I&#x27;ve ended up using it full time at home too. Dries my hair very quickly and smoothly, while cutting down on storage space and clutter. Win win!</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer last year on April 2 from &amp;#34;iShopHappy&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s already broken...complete with sparks and a terrible burning smell.  Beware for fakes and Chinese junk...when purchasing hairdryers and in life in general. Caveat Emptor!!!</li>
    <li> I am a small person, with small hands and found this dryer handle uncomfortably short &amp; hard to handle. It is not quiet and I would not recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer</li>
    <li> I have been a huge fan of the T3 line for years. My hair stylist used one to dry my hair and got me hooked on the product. I had my T3 dryer for over 7 years before it finally started to break down. I went to shop around for another T3 dryer at beauty supply stores and the cost was too expensive. I decided to look on Amazon and found the T3 Featherweight Journey Travel Dryer for a 1/3 of the cost. I love this dryer! I have very long, thick hair and because of the way this dryer is designed,it is very lightweight, my hair drys at least 40% faster and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. My hair always looks so beautiful after I have dried it with the T3. I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
    <li> This has hardly any power.. there is another product \\&quot;Pro Beauty Tools Pbdr5886 Professional Travel Hair Dryer, White and Black \\&quot; which is far cheaper at $25 and 1800 watts, ionic and dual voltage. I dont know why people complain about size of T3. Honestly you can get a smaller lighter dryer which are even more rubbish but light?!, you cant expect power from a smaller motor. I was actually looking for a full size hair dryer which is dual voltage. I dont care about weight so much as performance. Cant seem to find one :( But this is waste of money. By the way to note there is only ONE button for heat and fan. So only TWO settings, the description is misleading. You have low fan and high fan. That&#x27;s it. There is no adjustment for heat level despite what the description says.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. I am comparing it to my Super Solano Big red hair dryer that I purchased a year ago from Ulta Salon for about $70 dollars.   I have to say that it does feel like my hair is softer and smoother after using this dryer. It is extremely light and powerful. Overall, this dryer is a real pleasure to use. It comes with a black pocketed bag that you can store it in, which is also nice.   The popular saying, \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot; is applicable in this case.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this hair dryer. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> Only lasted about a year and then burned up.  It is only used once a day or so and you would think it should last longer.</li>
    <li> I never realized that spending a little more on a hairdryer could be so worth it. Cut my drying time in half. I&#x27;ve just never even thought of ordering a higher end hair dryer. Glad I finally wised up!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the function, results and the light weight. The problem is it made a funny noise let out some smoke then stopped working. I can hear a plastic rattle, and I can&#x27;t open it due to the way it&#x27;s constructed. The problem is the two year warranty is only in effect if you register the product within 21 days of purchase which I did not :(  If you do register and have access to your warranty services you will have to pay 14.95 for shipping and handling (kinda lame).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway mine has to be recycle or thrown out unfortunately because I didn&#x27;t meet the 21 days reg for the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;4 are still working of the 6  purchased, but they don&#x27;t use it as often as me. One was broken at first use, but she waited months after receiving it to try it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit for a family member and it is a great fit. The light weight and compact size is perfect for her at home use. She hasn&#x27;t used it for travel.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer lives up to its claims.  Dries hair fast tames frizzies and gives my fine and thin hair volume.  I like that it folds and it is very light weight.  I am a little worried as to the warranty because their website states only certain authorized dealers are covered.  Amazon is not one of them.  I trust that Amazon will stand behind this sale as they always do.</li>
    <li> It was great for the 1 day that it worked...I tried to turn it on the 2nd day and it  wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> This is my third ts3 featherweight in8 years. I travel a lot and this appliance gets a lot of rough treatment. If I didn&#x27;t forget to change from 120v to 240 v they would have lasted a lot longer</li>
    <li> Overheats REALLY easy :( It is light, small, cute and works ok apart from that... I would also prefer the tip &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Hard to use. I have a $20 hair drier that works better. Don&#x27;t get why it is so expensive. It  does not have a cool button</li>
    <li> My plans were to replace my travel hairdrier with this one but this one was bigger than mine.  The advantage I found is the noise. This hairdrier is not as loud as many other but to me the size was more important.  Would not work for me.  If size is not an issue this is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I like to use a dryer with high power, but low heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one control on this dryer that you can set to high, low, or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High is high power, high heat.&lt;br /&gt;Low is low power, high heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, way too hot for my fine, delicate blond hair!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer looking for something smaller and easier to use than I was presently using. This T3 Featherweight fit the bill!!</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer!  Bought this T3 Featherweight Journey Travel Dryer at Amazon.com with  Zadro Next Generation Lighted Travel Mirror &amp; 12 inch Brown Faux Crocodile Pattern 4 Extendable Trays Doctor Style Makeup Bag.  So looking forward to my next trip...  thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Same weight as my old big dryer.  Not lightweight!</li>
    <li> Not even close to the full size version of this dryer. Much longer drying time &amp; it&#x27;s very loud. I bought it to keep at my home away from home. I should have spent the extra $ and bought another full size T3.</li>
    <li> Works well. Quiet. Am happy with the product. Have not taken it on a trip - it&#x27;s a bit large for that.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a powerful travel dryer, like the rest of T3 dryers. I had to return it, not powerful enough for me. You can get much cheaper travel size dryers that will do the same job.</li>
    <li> I had the previous model and loved it.  This model is larger and heavier,  I also runs hotter that the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;I did not return it thinking that I would adapt to the changes which I have.  I would hesitate to buy another when&lt;br /&gt;this one stops working.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer shuts off after a few minutes because it gets so hot.  It was  disappointing because I was in Hawaii for a wedding and I couldn&#x27;t use it. I had to find another one.  Never again.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This item was disappointing. I was hoping that it would pack the same punch as the larger version but it&#x27;s not as strong.</li>
    <li> Not really a travel dryer unless you travel &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Pros: It is dual voltage (120 volts 60 hertz or 240 volts 50 hertz) allowing you to use it in the US and abroad. There is a screw for you to change the voltage. It&#x27;s almost as powerful and heats up like a regular dryer, which is a huge plus for me.  I&#x27;ve got a ton of hair and those wimpy hotel Sunbeam wall mount dryers just don&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s expensive. I would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full-size dryer for the price but if you travel a lot, as I do, the voltage option is key. It&#x27;s a lot heavier and bulkier than the typical travel hair dryer so I would not recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something small. There is a hinge at the handle that allows it to fold but it&#x27;s still far from compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking this dryer with me to Europe and it works great. I&#x27;ve been using it intermittently for a year and it&#x27;s still going strong. Essentially, it&#x27;s a full-size dryer but with a voltage option.  However, I don&#x27;t use this in lieu of my full size dryer because I love my light weight FHI Nano.</li>
    <li> I am so happy this hair dryer is light, well-functioned and totally enough for daily use and travel. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It is Light,powerful, convenient and very easy to pack. All the reviews were right on. This is amuse for travelling.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product because it does&lt;br /&gt;work great.</li>
    <li> Shipment took a while to get to its destination.  I was expecting a professional mini dryer specially the air difussor... bummer.. this is just like the ones that i could purchase in any department store.</li>
    <li> Great size and has adequate power...</li>
    <li> bought my dryer 2 months ago and it stopped working, goes on and off while drying.  contacted t3 and they will not replace it, well they will for almost 100.00, they say amazon is not an authorized dealer whatever that means, how would I know, and it is their dryer.  they are the worst when it comes to customer service.  I will throw this dryer away and never purchase their products again. All I wanted from them is a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;they suck and do not deserve even one star</li>
    <li> very good for my hear,make shaun!!</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with this dryer.  I have very thick hair but this dryer would not even move hair when it was partially air dry.  My asthmatic children can put out more air than this dryer.  I was hoping to take this dryer to Ireland, which I am leaving for in 10 days and now have no dryer to use while there.  Delivery of this item took 2 weeks which really has put me in a tight spot.  Needless to say I will never purchase this brand again...</li>
    <li> I am a business traveler and this is so easy to pack and carry.  I left one in my hotel room and this is a replacement.</li>
    <li> This product is not authentic. Silver warranty tag with serial number is missing.&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer advised me to return it and ask for full refund.</li>
    <li> I am always traveling and needed something light weight and small. After reading other reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I love it. It&#x27;s very light and small. It also comes with a travel size bag. It doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair. Very good dryer for those who&#x27;s always on the go or even if you&#x27;re not and you want something light and small!!!</li>
    <li> I have full size T3 for the home, and I wanted a compact T3 for travel (because no one wants to have a bad hair-day on vacation; think of the pictures!) I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it&#x27;s already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website. I had problem with my full size dryer (not this travel size one), and the T3 Co, honored their warranty and fixed it.</li>
    <li> I bought this blowdryer in 2004 and it always made my hair silky and shiny. This one which is advertised as the same exact thing doesn&#x27;t work the same. My hair is always looking dry and burnt. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this blowdryer. It is the same as any cheap blowdryer you can buy at Cvs.</li>
    <li> I travel all over the place.  This is a great dryer!  It packs well, dries well, and  works in all countries.</li>
    <li> Item works great so far.  Feel that the hair is softer compared to using my existing hair dryer.  It is a true 120/240 volt item (i.e. both Low and High works at either 120V or 240V).  (There are hair dryers on the market specified to be dual voltage; but when switched to 240V, it is locked at High and Low is blocked.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item received is without Serial Number.  Thus you cannot get original T3&#x27;s 2-year warranty.  Seller has contacted me that warranty is provided by the seller at the same term as T3.  Hopefully this can be specified in item description so consumers can evaluate the purchase with given facts.</li>
    <li> I have a full sized chi hair dryer, which I like.  I was looking for a similar dryer that I could take with me when I traveled -- hotel dryers were ok, but I missed a better dry...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is fine.  The handle collapses so it is easy enough to stow, and it also comes with its own little cloth bag which is good to keep the cord from getting tangled up during transport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dried well, though not as well as my full sized dryer at home.  No complaints, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for size, easy of use, and the nice added accessory of the bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the T3 Journey Hair Dryer after hearing two friends say such great things about it and how it made their hair silky smooth afterwards. I was very disappointed to see that it made no change to my hair, if anything, felt more corse afterwards. I thought both heat settings were too high. I&#x27;ve used other hair dryers in Japan with negative ionic energy that left my hair feeling amazing. Unfortunately, I could not use their products in the U.S. because of the difference in voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the T3 can be used with other voltages and the size and foldable component defintely makes it an ideal hair dryer for travelling. However, I wish I had spent more money to invest in a more effective product -- perhaps the T3 Featherweight 2 Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it might make a difference in hair types. My two friends who loved it are Asian and the other blonde. I am a redhead-Asian mix so perhaps that is why it didn&#x27;t work with my hair type?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to buy compact hair dryer but It is important a cold bottom ....&lt;br /&gt; Doesn&#x27;t have cold bottom.  I am shocked&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t  use customer &amp; myself....</li>
    <li> This thing takes a damp haired, angry wife, into a glowing beauty with gorgeous hair. It also has a suctioning action that&#x27;s not advertised, it sucks the angry out of nearby females and it pacifies them in a way I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dryer for about 8 months now. I am quite happy with my purchase. As far as dual voltage dryers go, this is one of the better ones. However, when used at 220V I find that drying time is greater. It leaves my hair quite soft and relatively frizz free even without a product. I have very thick , wavy hair with a lot of volume.</li>
    <li> bought the travel size and take it everywhere I go - use it everday - very light weight and strong power&lt;br /&gt;used to take me 10 minutes to dry my hair but is less than 3 minutes and I am done&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it - worth the money</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer ever,fast drying and easy to hold and use.  Our family has used them for&lt;br /&gt;a number of years</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have minded paying this amount for the dryer but it&#x27;s really not good for travel after all.  It&#x27;s much too large and heavy for tucking into a carry-on bag.  The name Featherweight is a bit misleading: it was more like the whole chicken plus the feathers...  Have sent it back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t write a review when I first bought this item, but I can tell you I LOVED it. It did not bother me that there were no specific settings  or other bells and whistles. It dried my hair really quickly and I was happy. So the last couple times I used it, it turned itself off and would not turn back on even after I clicked the reset button in the plug. I left to go to work and my husband said it started smoking from the cord, so he tossed it. I originally bought it in June, so it didn&#x27;t last even a year. :-(</li>
    <li> I have the full size T3, and I am very happy I purchased this travel size. It really does work to keep your hair less frizzy, and dries really quickly. The folding mechanism works well, so it fits nicely in my carry-on bag. I love the idea of not having to use the dryer in the hotel room.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have been using T3 Featherweight Dryers for 6 years now and I love them.  The Journey Travel Dryer is just as great!  Super convenient to fit in carry on luggage.  Surprisingly powerful for its size!! Love this- would recommend to any travelers that hate using hotel hair dryers!</li>
    <li> I have consistently used T3 hair dryers for perhaps 10 or so years.I have never purchased them through Amazon before,either through T3 directly or  from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In anticipation of an unexpected overseas trip,I wanted this travel hair dryer because of the dual voltage option.  I purchased from Amazon because I needed the hairdryer in less than 48 hours and Amazon was the only option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the hair dryer once before i left home and the T3worked terrific ,as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we arrived at our destination,I switched to the alternate current.  The machine failed to operate.  When we arrived home, the 110 worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I was unable to test this before leaving the US so I had no way of knowing,  Great disappointment.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Italy and it worked great for me.  It&#x27;s very small but also very powerful.  I have a lot of thick curly hair so a need a good hairdryer.  I also bought the diffuser attachment.  I actually think it&#x27;s better than the hairdryer I use at home!  You will need an adaptor but it has a voltage converter so it works much better than hairdryers that don&#x27;t have a voltage converter.  Worth the extra bucks.</li>
    <li> Dryer worked great until I took it abroad to another voltage.  After carefully switching the voltage, the hair dryer just died and never responded again - not even in the US.  Thought it was covered under warranty until T3 told me that Amazon is not a covered seller.  Def would not buy this generally, but certainly not from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer, I travel frequently and I am tired of the cheap hairdryers in hotels that burn my hair.  This lightweight dryer works quickly and is light enough to pack in suitcases.  It doesn&#x27;t have the power that my at home dryer has but gets the job done in the same amount of time!</li>
    <li> I was optimistic about this hairdryer but a few weeks in, a rattling noise started. Then after a few months, it totally stopped blowing warm air and I&#x27;m have to replace it. Would not recommend this product. It was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Totally not worth the money.  Nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer, timely delivery</li>
    <li> Got this for travel &amp; have found it to be almost as good as my full sized T3 which I love.</li>
    <li> I loved this travel dryer when I first used it.  However this morning, I plugged it in ready to go and there was no response.  I tried using several outlets in our house and got no action.  My last hair dryer lasted 8 years without failing.  This is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Be wary. No serial number on product box or on dryer and no warranty card. And, there is no such voltage as 125/250. My REAL T3 Featherweight Journey has all of the serial numbers and warranty card and the voltage is marked 120/240. The part that really gave it away is that it made my hair course and frizzy and I have virgin hair which never felt like that. My real Journey makes it feel like silk.</li>
