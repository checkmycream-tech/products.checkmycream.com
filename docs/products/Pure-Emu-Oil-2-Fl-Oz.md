      <li>I have been quite satisfied with anything I’ve purchased from Earth Essence.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and leaves a nice feel.</li>
      <li>Great product and fast delivery, got it in 2 days with prime.</li>
      <li>I don’t write reviews unless I’m excited with a product!</li>
      <li>They are lovely to deal with, purchases always arrive very quickly and they sell generous amounts for the price.</li>
      <li>Anyone reading this, I encourage that you use your favorite serum or light moisturizer, let it soak in and then pat on a pump of Emu Oil.</li>
      <li>:) I also use this oil once a week as a hair treatment over night and it makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>In the morning and at bedtime, after washing my face, I pat on 2 or 3 drops of my favorite serum, Savaun C25 Advanced Vitamin C Serum, let it soak in, and then pat on a pump of Emu Oil.  </li>
      <li>This is a fine quality oil.  </li>
      <li>Must have for those who are in need of a natural moisturizer that happens to be safe for piercings as well!</li>
      <li>I feel like I will get better results if I used the PURE EMU OIL</li>

      <li>Retirement in sunny Florida for over a year now has been wonderful but with it, unfortunately, the skin on my face began taking on a weathered look including sun spots.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used another brand of Emu oil for several years, but I like this one better already....</li>
      <li>Yes, it is thicker than olive oil or argan oil, thus the pump helps and makes the dispensing easy and mess free.</li>
      <li>I just received this a few days ago &amp; I love it!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It delivered fast and was wrapped up well</li>
      <li>I’m not only excited</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like many other oils and lotions I&#x27;ve used, and it really makes your skin feel fresh and moisturized for a long time after.</li>
      <li>After one week of using it twice a day, I noticed that my skin has not been this soft and plump even since before the sun damage and the sun spots are fading noticeably !  </li>
      <li>and I have learned that Emu Oil acts as the skins natural oil.</li>
      <li>If you use it on top of other products it will have a transdermal effect and push the active ingredients deeper into the skin’s layers.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and the little pump bottle delivers just the amount I want to use.</li>

<li> I usually use Jurassic Secret emu oil, but I thought I would try this since it was cheaper.</li>
<li> Just today my two-year-old broke out in itchy, painful hives as a result of an allergic reaction to grass, and I mixed a drop of lavender oil (also from Earth Elements) with three pumps of this, and in thirty minutes the hives were gone</li>
<li> I was concerned as it was delivered during the awful weather in the northeast and was half frozen on the porch, but it didn&#x27;t appear to affect the quality or condition of the oil.  </li>
<li> I even tried to wash it off, but it still stinks.</li>
<li> im sad :-(</li>
<li> Bad mistake</li>
<li> it smells really really bad.</li>

    <li> I used it on my hair for about a month. I did see any difference in hair growth.</li>
    <li> High quality emu oil at this price is hard to come by. The bottle&#x27;s pump nozzle gives the exact amount each time. Must have for those who are in need of a natural moisturizer that happens to be safe for piercings as well!</li>
    <li> Read up on this product this is not 100% EMU OIL because this product is USA refined. I feel like I will get better results if I used the PURE EMU OIL 100% NOT REFINED. been using this product 30 days no results. im sad :-(</li>
    <li> i use it alternately once a week in my hair and also mix it with my skin lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is amazing! I had never heard of it before, and after doing some research I decided to give it a shot. It makes an awesome massage oil and moisturizer. Just today my two-year-old broke out in itchy, painful hives as a result of an allergic reaction to grass, and I mixed a drop of lavender oil (also from Earth Elements) with three pumps of this, and in thirty minutes the hives were gone and she was napping peacefully! It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like many other oils and lotions I&#x27;ve used, and it really makes your skin feel fresh and moisturized for a long time after. Highly recommend!</li>

    <li> This is a fine quality oil.  No detectable scent. It&#x27;s very soothing and the little pump bottle delivers just the amount I want to use. I love this stuff. I could take a bath in it!</li>
    <li> hello,&lt;br /&gt;this oil is an excellent remedy for any kind of skin illness like sunburns mosquitoes bites, scars.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Exceeded my expectations. I would recomend that every home have this for the aches and pains of life...</li>
    <li> Retirement in sunny Florida for over a year now has been wonderful but with it, unfortunately, the skin on my face began taking on a weathered look including sun spots.  A friend recommended Emu Oil. After one week of using it twice a day, I noticed that my skin has not been this soft and plump even since before the sun damage and the sun spots are fading noticeably !  As you age the skin loses its oils and I have learned that Emu Oil acts as the skins natural oil. If you use it on top of other products it will have a transdermal effect and push the active ingredients deeper into the skin’s layers.  In the morning and at bedtime, after washing my face, I pat on 2 or 3 drops of my favorite serum, Savaun C25 Advanced Vitamin C Serum, let it soak in, and then pat on a pump of Emu Oil.  Anyone reading this, I encourage that you use your favorite serum or light moisturizer, let it soak in and then pat on a pump of Emu Oil. In the morning you will be very happy to see that it will plump up your skin significantly. Fine lines/wrinkles around lips and eyes (be careful not to get in your eyes) will be reduced remarkably. Your skin will look brighter and younger!  I’m finding that it will relieve an itch (bug bite) and to help a wound heal faster. It’s anti-inflamatory, anti- bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-septic. It will not clog your pores. I don’t write reviews unless I’m excited with a product! I’m not only excited, I’m overjoyed!  I only wish I would’ve known about it a long time ago and can’t recommend it enough! I have been quite satisfied with anything I’ve purchased from Earth Essence. I also purchase delightful Lavender Essential Oil from this company. They are lovely to deal with, purchases always arrive very quickly and they sell generous amounts for the price.</li>

    <li> I just received this a few days ago &amp; I love it!  I&#x27;ve used another brand of Emu oil for several years, but I like this one better already....consistency, absorption.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I was concerned as it was delivered during the awful weather in the northeast and was half frozen on the porch, but it didn&#x27;t appear to affect the quality or condition of the oil.  Goes on smoothly and leaves a nice feel.</li>
    <li> Does make my hair shine. Was wondering what else could I use it for.</li>
