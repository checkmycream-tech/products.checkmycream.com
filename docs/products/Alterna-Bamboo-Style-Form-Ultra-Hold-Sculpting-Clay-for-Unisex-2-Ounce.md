      <li>Great product for this 50 year old woman with a groovy hair do.</li>

      <li>It lasts all day and can mold easily.  </li>
      <li>The only good thing about it is that it smells nice.</li>
      <li>Not for those who can&#x27;t tolerate a strong product smell.</li>
      <li>great for short, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with the product as an alternative to the Alterna Concrete.</li>
      <li>now it is fulfilled through Amazon so Amazon Prime is available.</li>
      <li>this stuff is my new favorite!</li>
      <li>I have always been a fan of the original alterna..</li>
      <li>My Florida used it in my hair for the first time, and it gave my hair such beautiful hold.  </li>
      <li>Do not put too much in, use it very lightly after blow drying your hair post-shower.</li>
      <li>Perfect consistency and can lend a lot of volume to flat and wild hair</li>
      <li>really boosts my self-confidence, and I love it&#x27;s consistency.  </li>
      <li>For me, the ideal product has a firm hold</li>
      <li>Pretty easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>After unsuccessfully trying a couple of others, I luckily came across the bamboo product line.</li>
      <li>Easy to work with if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am glad that I found this product and appreciative of the other reviewers who pointed out its many fine features.</li>
      <li>(so my fine hair doesn&#x27;t move too much in the wind), is matte in texture</li>
      <li>I am a guy with shortish straight, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Excellent product..seems high in price, but goes a long way and last quite awhile!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a dry wax/clay that gives amazing hold.</li>
      <li>I saw that other reviewers said this was a great alternative to the Hemp Sculpting Putty, and I completely agree with their recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Alterna&#x27;s product is much lighter but has a superior hold compared to the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and finally found one that is just like it.  </li>
      <li>I stumbled upon this product by accident, but now I&#x27;m absolutely committed!</li>
      <li>It really holds your hair!</li>
      <li>I had tried many different clays.  </li>
      <li>: when I first purchased this, it was through Price Pros</li>
      <li>it holds a little better than Alterna Hemp hair concrete, I bought both at the same time to see which would hold better and the Bamboo version holds better.</li>
      <li>This product successfully accomplishes those things, which is why I&#x27;ve been using it loyally for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: because my hair is so fine, I sometimes spray a dry texturizing spray (Oscar Blandi, Bumble and Bumble, or Kerastase) into my hair before applying this clay in order to give my hair even more fullness and texture -- it gives the clay some extra grittiness to grab onto.</li>
      <li>LSB is heavier, therefore, causes your hair to lay down more quickly through the day.  </li>
      <li>The smell is good too, people certainly won&#x27;t be able to smell it in your proximity (which i think is good) and if a girlfriend is really close to your hair and gets a scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell like disgusting chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>This sculpting clay provides very strong hold even with medium length hair and best of all does not dry stiff or hard.</li>
      <li>I have short hair and overall I am very pleased with the way the product works with my hair.  </li>
      <li>I wear my hair real messy and this is the best product to use after I wash my hair and dry it.  </li>
      <li>I have short, fine hair and I</li>
      <li>Tried LSB and while it holds very well, Alterna is far superior for a few reasons:</li>
      <li>This is exactly like the hemp concrete that I&#x27;ve used for ages, just hope now that they don&#x27;t discontinue this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and I can spike my hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use much because I don&#x27;t want my pillow at night all &#x27;gunked&#x27; up when I sleep.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>However, use it very sparingly and at your roots as the product will make your hair look greasy if you use too much.</li>
      <li>Likewise, some complain that the clay has a fragrance, but I have not noticed any even though I am especially sensitive to smell.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness I found a replacement for their discontinued Concrete!</li>
      <li>product has a pleasant consistency and it only requires a tiny bit to style my hair, so one jar of this probably lasts 6+ months with daily use.  </li>
      <li>I like the new scent too!</li>
      <li>It gives the perfect texture for a \\&quot;piecey\\&quot; look without getting hard or feeling heavy and it retains its moldability all day.</li>
      <li>Recommend highly.</li>
      <li>Consequently, the bottle is actually very cheap because of how long it will last.</li>
      <li>It does take a little more washing to get it all out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>It has a little more of a fragrance than the Concrete.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would be similar to Redken&#x27;s discontinued Rough Clay 20.  This product is almost plastic like.  Hard to emulsify and apply.  Also, by the end of the day, my hair looks like I have dandruff from this product.</li>
    <li> I have short hair - my hair dresser uses this on my hair - it leaves it soft and yet you can do anything you want with your hair with your fingers if you want to</li>
    <li> Wow....&lt;br /&gt;So prior to this I was using Crew Fiber and let me tell you, the experience that Alterna gave me has officially made me a fan boy. Unlike waxes like Fiber, Alterna Bamboo is not sticky in the slightest! Which means no more ripping out hair by the roots on accident. Also this stuff actually holds very well and stays malleable throughout the entire day which is exactly what I wanted. The smell is good too, people certainly won&#x27;t be able to smell it in your proximity (which i think is good) and if a girlfriend is really close to your hair and gets a scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell like disgusting chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews mention that there is a white residue that gets left in their hair but I have not had this problem, they are probably just using an insane amount, so rest assure that this product does not suffer from that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t what else to say except this stuff is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Great non greasy matte finish. Thick and dry pasty consistency. Easy to work with if you don&#x27;t use too much. Adds volume and hold. Finish with some spray and your good for all day and night.</li>
    <li> My go-to hair product for years.. this stuff is awesome in moderation. Do not put too much in, use it very lightly after blow drying your hair post-shower. I&#x27;m only leaving 4 stars because IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WASH OUT. I literally have to shampoo my hair 3 times to get it out of my hair and I don&#x27;t even use a lot of the product. It&#x27;s a very good with the bad thing.. your hair will look great but you&#x27;re gonna have a hell of a time trying to rinse it out later. Out of all the products I&#x27;ve used over the years this still ranks as the best to date. I have a pushed back look.. long on the top and very short on the sides... works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This thing is the epitome of awful. It causes major buildup in your hair, the hold is average, and in general is not what it seems to be. I used this product once and i threw it away, my hair looking as if i dyed it white. The only good thing about it is that it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Smells great did not see results possible to be made for a different  type of hair expensive mistake would not repeat purchase</li>
    <li> I used a similar product, Alterna Extreme Wax Caviar, which has been discontinued. I&#x27;ve tried many products and finally found one that is just like it.  It&#x27;s not wet and sticky. It&#x27;s a dry wax/clay that gives amazing hold. I&#x27;m so happy I found this.</li>
    <li> After using Alterna Hemp Sculpting Putty for a few years and being exceptionally pleased with how it styled my hair, I was extremely disappointed to find out that it has been discontinued.  I saw that other reviewers said this was a great alternative to the Hemp Sculpting Putty, and I completely agree with their recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a pleasant consistency and it only requires a tiny bit to style my hair, so one jar of this probably lasts 6+ months with daily use.  I really liked the smell of the Hemp Sculpting Putty and this product&#x27;s scent, although different, is subtle and equally pleasing.  After styling my hair, my hair does not look greasy and the product does not make my hair hard, so it can be restyled after taking off a hat or bicycle helmet.  When I put on the product in the morning, it holds all day and my hair looks just as good in the evening as it did when I styled it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having my hair look nice really boosts my self-confidence, and I love it&#x27;s consistency.  I&#x27;ve never used a better product for my shortish- to medium-length hair.</li>
    <li> Thinking I was in a rut after finding out that Alterna Hemp Concrete was discontinued, I started to look for alternatives. After unsuccessfully trying a couple of others, I luckily came across the bamboo product line. This is exactly like the hemp concrete that I&#x27;ve used for ages, just hope now that they don&#x27;t discontinue this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gripe is that I&#x27;d like this product to be Amazon Prime eligible, and possibly \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: when I first purchased this, it was through Price Pros and I had to pay extra for shipping. Looks like now it is fulfilled through Amazon so Amazon Prime is available.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I found a replacement for their discontinued Concrete! I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit goes a long way! It gives the perfect texture for a \\&quot;piecey\\&quot; look without getting hard or feeling heavy and it retains its moldability all day. I like the new scent too!</li>
    <li> This will not make your hair greasy at all. If applied to dry hair then it will just give you control of your hair placement.</li>
    <li> Perfect consistency and can lend a lot of volume to flat and wild hair</li>
    <li> This is the answer to all my needs.  I had tried many different clays.  Anything from Aveda Clay to J. Crew but it all left my hair either greasy, sticky or too darn expensive.  I found this at another place on clearance.  I purchased it and was sick that I didn&#x27;t get every one on the shelf.  I was so happy to find it here.  I purchased several thinking if it is discontinued, I&#x27;ll at least have it for many months.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and I can spike my hair.  It lasts all day and can mold easily.  It does take a little more washing to get it all out of my hair.  But that doesn&#x27;t matter, I&#x27;m just going to spike it again.  Great product for this 50 year old woman with a groovy hair do.</li>
    <li> The scent is very strong. Unfortunately, I tried it once before I determined that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it, so I&#x27;ll be giving it away. Not for those who can&#x27;t tolerate a strong product smell.</li>
    <li> My fine, thin, straight hair finally has some body that no hair spray or gel could accomplish. Just a dab on my roots lifts my hair up like I have more of it. I use Suave professional sculpting on my ends to give them a little oomph and curl, this is too dry for that. But for body, it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have short straight hair and it needs a boost. It does its job by giving my hair body.  I don&#x27;t use much because I don&#x27;t want my pillow at night all &#x27;gunked&#x27; up when I sleep.  I little bit is fine and get me though until I shower in the morning.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and excellent service</li>
    <li> I have short, fine hair and I this product after blow-drying, and before hairspray.  I helps give lift and fullness to my super-flat hair. Less than the size of a pea for my short hair does the trick.  I rub it through my fingertips, then to the roots of my hair for volume, and a bit more at the ends for the &amp;#34;piecy&amp;#34; look I like.  No greasy or dirty appearance, and the scent is quite subtle.  I stumbled upon this product by accident, but now I&#x27;m absolutely committed!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to my previous hair styling products (Axe Messy and Hanz De Fuko Claymation)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, been using it every day for months now. Great hold without adding shine, exactly what I wanted. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Other reviews have mentioned that this is the replacement for Alterna Hemp Hair Concrete and I can confirm that it is the same with just a slightly different scent. This sculpting clay provides very strong hold even with medium length hair and best of all does not dry stiff or hard. It allows your hair to maintain a soft (although slightly sticky) texture that is re-styleable. It does not wash away with just water, so it is great for a &amp;#34;second-day&amp;#34; hair look. Because you do not need to use much product at all, the jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Been though alot of hair wax, this one is the one that I always go back to. It really holds your hair! Great smell!</li>
    <li> I started to get discouraged when I went around beauty supply stores and could not find the Alterna Hemp Hair Concrete product.  This Alterna product also does not flake and is not sticky, plus it smells good.  I have short hair and this product helps me with getting the body I need for my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great I love it!</li>
    <li> I have fine short hair and this is a wonderful product for me during the cooler months.  Once the temperature picks up, this product weighs too heavily in my hair.  Overall...it is a staple in my hair products!</li>
    <li> Great! This is the new version of the alterna hemp concrete, which is the closest thing I have ever found to replace Sebastian&#x27;s Xtah crude clay. Get it. End of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it&#x27;s long lasting, a little bit goes a long way. Tough hold and matte look. The texture is in the middle of clay and wax.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my son who had previously used and liked Xtah Crude Clay by Sebastian and since the company stopped making Crude my son was looking for a good replacement.  He reports that Alterna Bamboo works great!</li>
    <li> This is the only clay wax ill be using from now on it holds a little better than Alterna Hemp hair concrete, I bought both at the same time to see which would hold better and the Bamboo version holds better.</li>
    <li> Too stiff and it makes my hair feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This can last a guy 4-6 months as you use only a little and it is not water-soluble.  Has good hold.</li>
    <li> After searching online and asking around in disbelieve that Alterna discontinued the Hemp line products - particularly Concrete - I was pleasantly relieved to discover Sculpting Clay as it&#x27;s replacement. After a few uses it appears to be the same formula as Hemp Concrete with a different scent &amp; package. Feels, looks, and performs the same...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m curious why Alterna hadn&#x27;t provided any sort of communication to point customers/reviewers of Hemp line products to similar products within the new Bamboo line. I suppose a good product is better than good communication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy the same Concrete you once loved behind a new label!</li>
    <li> Great product, love it!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Pretty easy to wash out. Gives you a matte look while holding your hair in place. Looks very natural.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no replacement for it. Turns my hair into flexible pipe cleaners without adding weird shine to it. It&#x27;s the only thing that prevents my hair from returning to its natural state of &amp;#34;chia pet&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am still looking for a replacement for the discontinued Hemp Styling Putty and this is not going to be it..its just ok</li>
    <li> I wear my hair real messy and this is the best product to use after I wash my hair and dry it.  It is the best</li>
    <li> Very disappointing, after removing their hemp products, Alterna came up with this new bamboo based line, well, not just difficult to apply but let it dry and you will end with a white, dull, unmanageable hair, Big NO.</li>
    <li> This product provides great hold for my hair, which is incredibly fine and has always had the body of a tortilla. It allows me to give it a little bit of volume and put it where I want, and provides re-workability during the day. It does all this without making my hair feel crispy, crunchy, gooey, greasy, slimy, or pretty much any other adjective you could reasonably associate with hair styling products. And you use such a tiny amount (I have short hair), that the jar lasts forever! Well worth the cost. When Alterna&#x27;s stopped making their hemp-based product, I was disconsolate. When I discovered that it was replaced by this bamboo-based product, which was at least as good, if not better, I was disproportionately overjoyed. I know I&#x27;m a bit of a foolish writer, but it&#x27;s early and I haven&#x27;t had my coffee. Bottom line: You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of the original alterna.. My stylist had me hooked.. I did a little research found this and it&#x27;s basically the same as before</li>
    <li> I am a 68-year old male who has thinning hair that has lost its body. A little dab of this hair dressing gives my hair the body it needs to easily stay in place. It gives me the control over my hair that I had for years. The clay gives the hair a slight matt look, but that is an insignificant trade off for the control it provides. Notice that many other reviewers pointed out that you use an extremely small amount of the dressing each time. Consequently, the bottle is actually very cheap because of how long it will last. Some reviewers complained that the dressing made their hair feel greasy and that it was hard to wash out. My hair requires so little of the clay for holding that I have not had any of these problems. Likewise, some complain that the clay has a fragrance, but I have not noticed any even though I am especially sensitive to smell. Overall, I am glad that I found this product and appreciative of the other reviewers who pointed out its many fine features.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several years!  My Florida used it in my hair for the first time, and it gave my hair such beautiful hold.  You don&#x27;t need much.  It lasts at least nine months!  When I came home to New Hampshire, I couldn&#x27;t find it any where.  My NH hairdresser never heard of it.  So I tried Amazon and there it was.  I&#x27;ve been getting it on Amazon for awhile now!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product..seems high in price, but goes a long way and last quite awhile!</li>
    <li> Alterna&#x27;s Bamboo Style Form Ulta Hold Sculpting Clay works just great.  I was looking for something that replaced the Hair Concrete and this does the trick.  I won&#x27;t be ordering it from Amazon anymore though.  The shipping charge was astranomical.</li>
    <li> I previously used their Hemp product in the green container and tried this as a replacement. For me, the stuff is just too thick and sticky. After applying to my head, it takes an excessive amount of soap to get the residue off my hand. And it tends to make my hair feel dirty.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for my short piecy haircut.  Gives perfect texture, grit, and volume, and washes out easily.  Only has a low to medium hold, but that&#x27;s fine with me.  Hint: use shampoo to wash it off your hands, it works better than hand soap.</li>
    <li> thought i would not find this again- however- this is as good as the original product!! love it!!  highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> great for short, fine hair. It is not heavy or greasy like others</li>
    <li> This is the only product I will use!! I have shorter hair and this product gives my hair enough texture to work with without making it greasy and heavy. 100%</li>
    <li> This is a great product for styling your hair and making it stay in place..flipped up..poked out without feeling like glue. However, use it very sparingly and at your roots as the product will make your hair look greasy if you use too much. It also tends to build up on a daily basis. I either used baking soda mixed with my regular shampoo or and cleansing shampoo designed to remove build-up.</li>
    <li> This is the brand used by my hairdresser, and I will continue to use it at home.  Tried LSB and while it holds very well, Alterna is far superior for a few reasons: Better scent.  The other?  Kinda smelled waxy and like burning plastic.  LSB also is difficult to get out of your hair when washing.  I found I needed to wash and rinse twice in one shower.  Alterna washes out easily, no problem.  LSB is heavier, therefore, causes your hair to lay down more quickly through the day.  Alterna&#x27;s product is much lighter but has a superior hold compared to the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the sculpting clay I will continue to buy and use.  Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Really great product. A bit sticky though so it can be hard to work through the hair. I use it everyday though and it holds and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy looking.</li>
    <li> I love this clay. I was a user of Sebastian Xtah Crude Clay and this is very much the same. I highly recommend this clay if you have short hair that needs fullness and long-lasting hold.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I am a guy with shortish straight, fine hair. I am a professional hairstylist and have tried many other products on my own hair (a few of my other favorites before this were from Bumble and Bumble, American Crew, and D:fi). For me, the ideal product has a firm hold (so my fine hair doesn&#x27;t move too much in the wind), is matte in texture (I hate the wet look on my own hair), doesn&#x27;t leave my hair even the least big greasy, and holds up through a long day. This product successfully accomplishes those things, which is why I&#x27;ve been using it loyally for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: because my hair is so fine, I sometimes spray a dry texturizing spray (Oscar Blandi, Bumble and Bumble, or Kerastase) into my hair before applying this clay in order to give my hair even more fullness and texture -- it gives the clay some extra grittiness to grab onto.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to try as a replacement for the discontinued Alterna Concrete.  Product is very similar in texture. It has a little more of a fragrance than the Concrete. I have short hair and overall I am very pleased with the way the product works with my hair.  In my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same hold as the concrete but I believe it is as close as you can get. This product can give you a spiky look without the hardness of most gels, etc. Very satisfied with the product as an alternative to the Alterna Concrete.</li>
