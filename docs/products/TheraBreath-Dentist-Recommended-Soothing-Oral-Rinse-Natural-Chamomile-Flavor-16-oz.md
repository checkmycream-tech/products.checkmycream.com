### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>TheraBreath is wonderful for gums and any short-term inflammation or pain (it&#x27;s particularly wonderful after a visit to the dentist.)</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant taste and your gums will feel refreshed.</li>
      <li>The bottle claims that this is the ideal rinse for pairing with post-dental visits or post-whitening.</li>
      <li>The taste is great, minty and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And it works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a pleasant and soothing mouthwash without the stinging sensation associated with alcohol.</li>
      <li>Since I got this, I find I can rinse with this after the prescription one, and it makes my mouth pleasant again</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I spit it out that I could taste the pleasant flavor.</li>
      <li>While it is a good product and does soothe the gums, you will need to look elsewhere if you are having gum issues.</li>
      <li>With soothing aloe and chamomile and cleansing ClO2 and sodium bicarbonate this is a good mouth rinse product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a mouth wash that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; but still gives you a nice cleaning feeling, this is a great choice.</li>
      <li>A good product.</li>
      <li>I have heard it is good for teeth and prevents cavities.</li>
      <li>best recommendation I can give is when you get something free to review from Vine</li>
      <li>It made my mouth feel good.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a good mouthwash, but not something I want to use every day.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good mouthwash that does feel protective.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a really nice neutralizing mouth wash that reduces sensitivity and feels good on the enamel.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it, I wasn’t too impressed.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice to know the ingredients help to alleviate gum irritation.</li>
      <li>My son didn&#x27;t like the way it tasted, but he liked the way it made his mouth feel afterwards and uses it twice a day, as directed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very mild, pleasant, and soothing oral rinse.</li>
      <li>A good herbal Oral Rinse like Jason&#x27;s Healthy  Mouth or mouthwash that reduce plaque and bacteria or gingivitis would be a better option (without alcohol).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
      <li>It is sweetened with sugar alcohols (sorbitol, xylitol) which are safe to use in a mouth rinse.</li>
      <li>what more can you say about a product?</li>
      <li>~oral hygienist recommended this Polysorbate 20 ~a surfactant or wtting agent (like Sodium Laurel Sulfate) which may help the taste spread more evenly Tatrasodium Pyrophosphate ~a tartar control agent that removes calcium and magnesium from saliva, thus preventing them from being deposited on teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m not convinced it helps with sensitivity, I am convinced it is healthy for your teeth and gums to rinse them when you brush.</li>
      <li>burn mostly associated with many mainstream mouthwash/rinses.</li>
      <li>Maybe all of those are cute bunnies and grow on trees, so I am just listing those here since they did not bother to put list of ingredients on the page.</li>
      <li>I love chamomile for its many healthy qualities.</li>
      <li>hygienist recommended this&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 20 ~a surfactant or wtting agent (like Sodium Laurel Sulfate) which may help the taste spread more evenly</li>
      <li>And most were not things I would want to put in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doing so with something that also tastes and feels refreshing helps a lot.</li>
      <li>There is no sting while swishing the product in your mouth, in that it feels more like the ACT children&#x27;s rinse.</li>
      <li>Really refreshing and does not leave an aftertaste.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have major gum issues, this is good product, with good ingredients.</li>
      <li>mouth wash has a pleasant and mild flavor, which makes swishing it for the full one minute a bit easier.</li>
      <li>This soothing oral rinse is great for anyone with sensitive, whether temporary or not, teeth.</li>
      <li>This is great for my sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
      <li>I still get the nice and fresh feeling in my breath.</li>
      <li>You are supposed to rinse for a full minute which is easy enough even if not the best tasting oral rinse out there.  </li>
      <li>This wash has a nice natural taste, feels soothing and refreshing without being too strong and no burn!</li>
      <li>But for those looking mainly for a breath-freshener between meals, there are superior products on the market.</li>
      <li>I think it’s great as an occasional rinse, and I find myself most using it when I need a quick refreshing pick me up.</li>
      <li>If you have a temporary condition or can handle the minty mouthwashes and their after-effects, the this will be fine for you.  </li>
      <li>This is possibly the most soothing, pleasant mouth wash I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of trying.</li>
      <li>The taste is light with a hint of mint and nary an aftertaste or mouth</li>
      <li>and I can enjoy my food.</li>
      <li>This truly is a soothing oral rinse that is gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>I liked the flavor  since it seemed much milder than Listerine etc.</li>
      <li>The mouthwash appears to have a good load of natural ingredients, as well as some proprietary blends, aloe, chamomile, and xylitol.</li>
      <li>Overall while this is probably very effective for some and the taste is just what they want, for me</li>
      <li>If you love having a fresh clean mouth morning and night, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For a natural alcohol-free mouth rinse, this has a nice strong flavor.</li>
      <li>It was cool and refreshing but very gentle and non evasive.</li>
      <li>This rinse fills the bill, but does not leave you with that clean and minty breath afterwards.</li>
      <li>TheraBreath&#x27;s Soothing Oral Rinse is a mild minty mouth rinse that is alcohol free.  </li>
      <li>It is way too sickeningly sweet for my taste.</li>
      <li>So many mouthwashes have alcohol and burn too much.</li>
      <li>It seems a lot more reasonable to just continue to do that.</li>
      <li>In fact, sugar, whole grain, bran and germ, and oatmeal, are considered the top leading threats for the destruction of teeth.</li>
      <li>If not, it still feels good on the enamel but may not be necessary.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>rinse has a mild feel and flavor.</li>
      <li>It does not have the best taste but nothing unpleasant either, kind of tastes like medicine.  </li>
      <li>I was so pleased with this mouthwash-- with its mild somewhat minty taste, natural ingredients</li>
      <li>I really enjoy how gentle this mouthwash goes in my mouth.</li>
      <li>: If you&#x27;re on a powerful teeth-whitening regimen and have teeth sensitivity, this is a must.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more for comfort, as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>This herbal oral rinse product contains ingredients designed to soothe your teeth and gums, leave a fresh breath, and allow teeth to remineralize.</li>
      <li>To me it is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>TheraBreath&#x27;s oral rinse is made with more natural ingredients than anything else on the market.</li>
      <li>This one soothes my teeth and gums and makes my breath feel fresh.  </li>
      <li>If you are having gum and teeth issues this is worth trying.</li>
      <li>What I do know is that my breath didn&#x27;t feel quite as fresh as it does with a Listerene or Scope.</li>
      <li>I could tell right away that my teeth weren&#x27;t quite as &#x27;on-edge&#x27; after a minute or two rinse.</li>
      <li>I would say this mouthwash is right on the money.</li>
      <li>just the right amount to try this product out consistently.</li>
      <li>It definitely doesn’t have a fresh minty taste like most mouthwashes, but it also doesn’t have the burn that some mouthwashes have.</li>
      <li>They also say that it remineralizes teeth which, especially as you&#x27;re getting older, is a nice benefit of a mouthwash.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have the risks to mouth health overall that more aggressive products like Listerine may have.</li>
      <li>you stiffed me for the PROs and CONs format of my last consumer review, I&#x27;m going to attempt something more, as they say, &amp;#34;integrative,&amp;#34; this time.</li>
      <li>It is pretty minty</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a good oral rinse that left my mouth feeling fresh.</li>

      <li>follows the symbol ~ below, and I couldn&#x27;t always tell exactly the purpose of these chemicals.</li>
      <li>Daily use for me has been a pleasant experience and with my constant flossing</li>
      <li>The natural ingredients are a huge plus in my book, and it absolutely soothes and relieves oral discomfort.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a regular user of mouth rinses who always looks for alcohol free ingredients.  </li>
      <li>The oral rinse is quite gentle and soothing.</li>
      <li>This is a somewhat pricey product for something that doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>The inner closure cap stays clean as it never touches my lip.</li>
      <li>This is a very gentle, natural mouthwash that provides soothing relief from tooth sensitivity.</li>
      <li>This is a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s better to pay more for something therapeutic and non-toxic than to get something cheap that can actually harm you.</li>
      <li>When they advertise as &amp;#34;Natural Chamomile,&amp;#34; you may think this is a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, but in fact there are more than a half dozen ingredients listed that I had to search out to find what they really were.</li>
      <li>My consumer products review head, the underpaid and overworked Nicolas Turner, dropped off the followed memo at my London Flat (along with a 99% full bottle of this</li>
      <li>High levels of sugar destroys teeth by interfering with calcium and phosphorus ratios in the blood, and acid in the grains destroys teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This herbal oral rinse product contains ingredients designed to soothe your teeth and gums, leave a fresh breath, and allow teeth to remineralize. This contains several good ingredients to support what it is designed to do, while leaving out artificial chemicals and ingredients that you don&#x27;t need. It is sweetened with sugar alcohols (sorbitol, xylitol) which are safe to use in a mouth rinse. Xylitol has actually been found to have beneficial effects on oral health. With soothing aloe and chamomile and cleansing ClO2 and sodium bicarbonate this is a good mouth rinse product. This is a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s better to pay more for something therapeutic and non-toxic than to get something cheap that can actually harm you. If you are having gum and teeth issues this is worth trying. You may also want to consider finding good mineral supplements to help with dental health and cutting down on acid-forming foods and beverages in your diet.</li>
    <li> My consumer products review head, the underpaid and overworked Nicolas Turner, dropped off the followed memo at my London Flat (along with a 99% full bottle of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey MAG,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SInce you stiffed me for the PROs and CONs format of my last consumer review, I&#x27;m going to attempt something more, as they say, &amp;#34;integrative,&amp;#34; this time. This stuff isn&#x27;t bad at all, and would make a nice shower or bridegroom gift for someone who needs a hint.  It certainly works well; the refreshed feeling lasts for a long time (or til you swill your next big cup of coffee), and there&#x27;s no alcohol, unlike those that popular amber-tinged mouthwashed named after Dr. Lister that seems like it *must* be working because of its medicinal look and drying, puckering feeling in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPeaking of alcohol, someone put too much aloe or chamomile or glycerin, or ammonium glycyrrhizate (derived from licorice) in this, because it has a taste which, if it were in tequila or scotch, could only be described as vegetal or &amp;#34;green.&amp;#34;  In fact, the taste recalls tequila; that is, if one *can* recall tasting tequila.  That was a big downer for me.  I&#x27;d rather drink some quality tequila, then brush my teeth really well, including the tongue, like that woman advises Leonard to do in &amp;#34;Super Sad True Love Story.&amp;#34;  The ingredients seem mostly natural, although some of them were so unnatural -sounding I had to look them up in Wikipedia.  My paraphrasing (don&#x27;t want to plagiarize!) follows the symbol ~ below, and I couldn&#x27;t always tell exactly the purpose of these chemicals. Overall, it seems thoughtfully formulated, but I&#x27;m returning 99% of the bottle to you, in accordance with Vine rules (although I suspect you&#x27;re just too cheap to give anything away), and that unfortunate more-than-a-hint of green tequila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catch you later,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water (Aqua)&lt;br /&gt;Sorbitol&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice,&lt;br /&gt;PVP ~Polyvinylpyrrolidone, several chemical properties and uses&lt;br /&gt;OXYD-8 (Dr. Katz&#x27;s patented version of Cl02) ~CIO-2 is chloride dioxide, a disinfectant&lt;br /&gt;Chamomilla Rectutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernal Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Allantoin ~anti-irritant, protects skin&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin (from vegetable sources)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Citrate&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol ~oral hygienist recommended this&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 20 ~a surfactant or wtting agent (like Sodium Laurel Sulfate) which may help the taste spread more evenly&lt;br /&gt;Tatrasodium Pyrophosphate ~a tartar control agent that removes calcium and magnesium from saliva, thus preventing them from being deposited on teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Disodium EDTA-Copper  Used by dentists and other oral health professionals  to remove inorganic debris&lt;br /&gt;Ammonium Glycyrrhizate~ natural material isolated from the licorice plant, Glycyrrhiza glabra for flavor,&lt;br /&gt; Menthol, Citric Acid, Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;Does not Contain: Alcohol, Saccharin, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Benzalkonium Chloride (an allergen)&#x27;s patented version of Cl02) ~CIO-2 is chloride dioxide, a disinfectant Chamomilla Rectutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernal Extract, Allantoin ~anti-irritant, protects skin Glycerin (from vegetable sources) Sodium Citrate Xylitol ~oral hygienist recommended this Polysorbate 20 ~a surfactant or wtting agent (like Sodium Laurel Sulfate) which may help the taste spread more evenly Tatrasodium Pyrophosphate ~a tartar control agent that removes calcium and magnesium from saliva, thus preventing them from being deposited on teeth.

    <li> This rinse is meant to help soothe discomforts caused by dental procedures or tooth whitening.  It also says that it is for use for more long-term sensitivity issues, if used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used twice a day, this becomes super expensive.  I measured the amount in the cup and it is 15 mL.  Since there is 473 mL in the bottle,  that makes this a 15 day supply.  Today’s price is $8.40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few sensitive teeth that are really aggravating.  I warm up ice cream in the microwave and do other stupid things like not put ice in my drinks.  It seems a lot more reasonable to just continue to do that.</li>
    <li> This is great for my sensitive gums and teeth. It cleanses well without an extreme burning feeling. The flavor is a bit weird to me, but the chamomile isn&#x27;t super overpowering. Overall, this is a good oral rinse that left my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> TheraBreath&#x27;s Soothing Oral Rinse is a mild minty mouth rinse that is alcohol free.  My son uses the TheraBreath Icy Fresh mouth rinse, and in conjunction with the tooth paste, this has helped tame his horrid breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Icy Mint Fresh Breath rinse, which is colorless, the Soothing rinse is a pale blue color.  It has both aloe and chamomile in the formulation, as well as sorbitol (a sugar alcohol often used as a sweetener and a thickener), and xylitol (a sugar alcohol which has been shown to help prevent cavities).  It has several other ingredients as well as menthol for flavor, as well as my personal favorite ingredient: Ammonium Glycyrrhizate (aka licorice root).  The flavor is very mild, just slightly minty-so if you are looking for a serious minty-fresh feeling this is not the rinse for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot attest to the efficacy of this product in relieve temporary mouth discomfort, but it does help to slightly alleviate my occasional tooth sensitivity.  It is not terribly effective as a breath freshener if you suffer from horrid breath, but for normal after eating breath issues it is fine.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this mouth wash was the lack of &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; you feel with other brands. I&#x27;m okay with that. There are times when I wake up in the middle of the night with morning breath so unpleasant that I will get up for a quick mouth swish of something, and I&#x27;m all for something with burn. It feels like it&#x27;s burning away whatever gave me morning breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then there&#x27;s the other times when I don&#x27;t really need something that burns my mouth like vodka lit on fire. Like in the morning after brushing my teeth or mid-day when you just want your mouth a little refreshed, like you just had a breath mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouth wash has a pleasant and mild flavor, which makes swishing it for the full one minute a bit easier. I can definitely rinse with it longer than my Crest and Scope mouth washes. And rinsing with this after having dental work done or seeing the dentist would be far less painful than trying to brush ones teeth or use one of the stronger alcohol based mouth washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a mouth wash that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; but still gives you a nice cleaning feeling, this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> Xylitol schmilitol, it&#x27;s barely noticeable and considering the alternatives (gmo sourced sweeteners) I would say this mouthwash is right on the money. The taste is light with a hint of mint and nary an aftertaste or mouth burn mostly associated with many mainstream mouthwash/rinses. It works well and gives you the confidence of fresh breath without having to use the obligatory hand cup over the mouth because your not sure if your &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; mouthwash has failed. If you&#x27;ve had your teeth professionally whitened recently, this mouthwash has sealing agents that help protect from teeth staining and sensitivity. A feature I&#x27;ve yet to put fully to the test but will update in the future. Daily use for me has been a pleasant experience and with my constant flossing it&#x27;s nice to know the ingredients help to alleviate gum irritation. At $14 for 16 ounces this mouthwash is a tad on the expensive side considering the less expensive over the counter versions, but then you have to deal with mouth burn and gmo sweetners. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with this mouthwash-- with its mild somewhat minty taste, natural ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t have the risks to mouth health overall that more aggressive products like Listerine may have. It did as promised--soothed some inflammation, freshened breath and felt cleaner. They also say that it remineralizes teeth which, especially as you&#x27;re getting older, is a nice benefit of a mouthwash. I didn&#x27;t know that was even possible, especially with natural ingredients, so that&#x27;s an added plus (and makes it easier to be consistent with the 1 minute rinsing twice a day). My son didn&#x27;t like the way it tasted, but he liked the way it made his mouth feel afterwards and uses it twice a day, as directed. (it comes with a cup to put the mouthwash into). I liked the flavor  since it seemed much milder than Listerine etc. but I guess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best recommendation I can give is when you get something free to review from Vine and then it becomes something that you&#x27;re going to keep buying after its used up. That&#x27;s how this was. A good product.</li>
    <li> Oatmeal destroys teeth according to the book Cure Tooth Decay. In fact, sugar, whole grain, bran and germ, and oatmeal, are considered the top leading threats for the destruction of teeth. High levels of sugar destroys teeth by interfering with calcium and phosphorus ratios in the blood, and acid in the grains destroys teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be RECALLED</li>
    <li> I have severe dry mouth from an illness and am always concerned about mouthwashes and rinses. They typically burn and sometimes cause sores. This says that it helps with sensitivity caused by minor dental procedures like mouth whitening, not necessarily for someone with sever dry mouth.  It is pretty minty so if you have a super sensitive mouth I&#x27;m not sure I recommend this to them.  If you have a temporary condition or can handle the minty mouthwashes and their after-effects, the this will be fine for you.  It made my mouth feel good.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call it soothing but it&#x27;s a good mouthwash that does feel protective.</li>
    <li> Those who&#x27;ve used commercial mouthwash in the past (Listerine, Scope, Colgate, etc.) are in for a decidedly different experience than before. TheraBreath&#x27;s oral rinse is made with more natural ingredients than anything else on the market. There is no sting while swishing the product in your mouth, in that it feels more like the ACT children&#x27;s rinse. With ingredients like chamomile, water, aloe leaf juice, and flower extract, &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; buyers will be attracted to this product and pair it with Tom&#x27;s of Maine and other earth-minded dental hygiene products. The bottle claims that this is the ideal rinse for pairing with post-dental visits or post-whitening. The chamomile and aloe combine for a soothing effect for those with sensitive teeth and gums due to a procedure. I cannot comment on its efficacy as I was using it for normal, daily use. What I do know is that my breath didn&#x27;t feel quite as fresh as it does with a Listerene or Scope. This product is made in the U.S. by Dr. Harold Katz. In terms of appearance, packaging, and novelty--TheraBreath gets high marks. But for those looking mainly for a breath-freshener between meals, there are superior products on the market. 4/5 stars.</li>
    <li> For a natural alcohol-free mouth rinse, this has a nice strong flavor. If you love having a fresh clean mouth morning and night, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has a soothing mouthfeel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m not convinced it helps with sensitivity, I am convinced it is healthy for your teeth and gums to rinse them when you brush. Doing so with something that also tastes and feels refreshing helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this mouthwash. It is way too sickeningly sweet for my taste. It contains two different sweeteners, Sorbitol and Zylitol. This is a mouthwash. I don&#x27;t understand why it needs to be sweetened, much less double sweetened. If that&#x27;s not bad enough, it leaves a terrible aftertaste. The first time I used it was before bed and I actually had to get up and brush my teeth again, and use my normal mouthwash to try to get rid of the nasty aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has no problem with it, so I gave it to him to use. I will be sticking to my favorite mouthwash that has no sweeteners at all, and zero flavor unless I want to add the little tube of peppermint they send with it. And it works great.</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle, natural mouthwash that provides soothing relief from tooth sensitivity. The other benefit is the xylitol. I have heard it is good for teeth and prevents cavities. So many mouthwashes have alcohol and burn too much. This wash has a nice natural taste, feels soothing and refreshing without being too strong and no burn! If you have any tooth sensitivity, you need this mouthwash! Within a week my sensitivity was gone. What a relief. I will definitely buy it again. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This truly is a soothing oral rinse that is gentle and effective. I have recently begun whitening my teeth and this can be very painful for me as I already have sensitive teeth and thin enamel. I noticed that after using this oral rinse 2 times per day as directed, I didn&#x27;t feel the usual pain from hot and cold foods after whitening. I was very pleased with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that one thing that confused me was the actual uses for this product. Printed in the &amp;#34;About the Product&amp;#34; section listed on Amazon, it reads, &amp;#34;Dentist recommended for post-whitening use and to help relive sensitivity associated with tooth whitening.&amp;#34; The bottle reads, &amp;#34;Dentist recommended for post whitening use&amp;#34;, however on the side of the bottle it reads, &amp;#34;Does not relieve or treat sensitive teeth, oral pain or gum disease&amp;#34;. These statements tend to contradict each other. Does it help with sensitivity or not? All I can say is that I did notice a different (an improvement) in how sensitive my teeth were after whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rinse has a mild feel and flavor. When swishing it around in my mouth for 1 minute (as directed) I did not taste a flavor at all! It was cool and refreshing but very gentle and non evasive. It wasn&#x27;t until I spit it out that I could taste the pleasant flavor. This rinse is alcohol free so there is absolutely no burning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have posted, I too noticed the soothing effect from this rinse when I had cut some skin on my soft palate from eating crusty french bread. I used this rinse after noticing the discomfort and within a few minutes, felt much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very mild, pleasant, and soothing oral rinse. The 16oz bottle size is convenient to store (not too big) and just the right amount to try this product out consistently. I also appreciate that this produce is Vegan and Kosher and is all natural, containing zero artificial flavors or colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I think this is a good mouthwash, but not something I want to use every day. I think it’s great as an occasional rinse, and I find myself most using it when I need a quick refreshing pick me up. It’s hard to rinse for the full minute sometimes. It definitely doesn’t have a fresh minty taste like most mouthwashes, but it also doesn’t have the burn that some mouthwashes have. I don’t find it particularly soothing and while I don’t hate it, I won’t be replacing my current mouthwash.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice neutralizing mouth wash that reduces sensitivity and feels good on the enamel. I would highly, highly recommend it for those with teeth sensitivity after using teeth whitening products. I could tell right away that my teeth weren&#x27;t quite as &#x27;on-edge&#x27; after a minute or two rinse. It doesn&#x27;t have a distinct taste, but it does still leave you with a gross taste afterwards.  It reminds me of being at the dentist in a bad way, but that&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s the same high quality product that dentists use. It&#x27;s unpleasant enough that I would have a hard time using it every day unless I was on a whitening treatment or had teeth sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: If you&#x27;re on a powerful teeth-whitening regimen and have teeth sensitivity, this is a must. If not, it still feels good on the enamel but may not be necessary.</li>
    <li> This is possibly the most soothing, pleasant mouth wash I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of trying. While it&#x27;s antibacterial properties aren&#x27;t on par with, say, Listerine, TheraBreath is wonderful for gums and any short-term inflammation or pain (it&#x27;s particularly wonderful after a visit to the dentist.) I wouldn&#x27;t replace ACT or Listerine with TheraBreath, but then, it&#x27;s an entirely different product. It&#x27;s more for comfort, as far as I can tell. The natural ingredients are a huge plus in my book, and it absolutely soothes and relieves oral discomfort. Five stars.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy how gentle this mouthwash goes in my mouth. It doesn&#x27;t have the stinging or burning sensation like my regular mouthwash (Listerine) does in my mouth. It does have a soothing effect especially along my sensitive gum line. The taste is great, minty and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the measuring cap is separate from the closure cap. The measuring cap snaps off the bottle and has a line in it to measure the dosage. The inner closure cap stays clean as it never touches my lip. When I&#x27;m done I just rinse the measuring cap. The mouthwash appears to have a good load of natural ingredients, as well as some proprietary blends, aloe, chamomile, and xylitol. There is no alcohol, so no stinging sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a pleasant and soothing mouthwash without the stinging sensation associated with alcohol. I still get the nice and fresh feeling in my breath. I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have have some oral sensitivities for a while now and have been looking for some low cost alternatives.  After using this Oral Rinse for a couple weeks now I have definitely notice a difference as my mouth stings less than before with less sensitivity to cold food and drinks.  It does not have the best taste but nothing unpleasant either, kind of tastes like medicine.  You are supposed to rinse for a full minute which is easy enough even if not the best tasting oral rinse out there.  One other advantage it has, where some other oral rinses will have adverse effects on the taste of foods and drinks for hours after use, this Oral Rinse says you can start eating and drinking five minute after use.  My one small complaint is that even though it comes with a second cap to correctly measure the right amount to use, it is slightly unclear where the line is.  There is a line that goes all the way around the cap and then a smaller line right above it so it is a bit unclear which line to use.</li>
    <li> Not bad. It did seem to sooth an aching gum that I have. The taste is not bad...but not great either.</li>
    <li> This soothing oral rinse is great for anyone with sensitive, whether temporary or not, teeth. It helps to soothe the pain without numbing. It also helps freshen breath and even helps whiten!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth, look no further!</li>
    <li> Works well for mouth irritation, but not a rinse I would use on a regular basis. When they advertise as &amp;#34;Natural Chamomile,&amp;#34; you may think this is a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, but in fact there are more than a half dozen ingredients listed that I had to search out to find what they really were. And most were not things I would want to put in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the price. Wow. I think I will go back to using chamomile tea as a rinse, and leave this product to those who prefer the convenience of a pre mixed rinse at a premium price.</li>
    <li> Really refreshing and does not leave an aftertaste. I love chamomile for its many healthy qualities. For occasionally bleeding gums I&#x27;ve been prescribed a rinse that tastes pretty awful. I can&#x27;t even drink coffee afterward, so I tend to use it at bedtime when I won&#x27;t be eating anymore. Since I got this, I find I can rinse with this after the prescription one, and it makes my mouth pleasant again and I can enjoy my food. It is not for every day, but has a soothing effect for those times you need a little help. I am buying a bottle for my son who has occasional problems with his gums.</li>
    <li> The oral rinse is quite gentle and soothing. It does say it is only for use after whitening procedures and such, not for real oral problems, the box warns you about those &amp;#34;Does not relieve or treat sensitive teeth, oral pain or gum disease&amp;#34;. So, basically, it only works when you do not have any problems in your mouth. When you do - it does not. I am confused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not taste as harsh as many other oral rinses, and it is not burning at all. It has quite sweet - artificial sweetener - like aftertaste, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for claiming that it is natural - it has natural chamomlile flavor, it is not all natural - it has long list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Purified Water (Aqua), Sorbitol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, PVP, OXYD-8 (Dr. Katz&#x27;s patented version of Cl02), Chamomilla Rectutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernal Extract, Allantoin, Glycerin (from vegetable sources), Sodium Citrate, Xylitol, Polysorbate 20, Tatrasodium Pyrophosphate, Disodium EDTA-Copper, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Menthol, Citric Acid, Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;Does not Contain:  Alcohol, Saccharin, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Benzalkonium Chloride (an allergen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Maybe all of those are cute bunnies and grow on trees, so I am just listing those here since they did not bother to put list of ingredients on the page. It is not 4 ingredients as the item&#x27;s description lead us to believe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of mouth rinses who always looks for alcohol free ingredients.  This rinse fills the bill, but does not leave you with that clean and minty breath afterwards. I describe it as funky-not necessarily bad but not desirable. It tastes like medicine, but without the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carefully follow the package instructions not to eat or drink for five minutes afterwards.  Food will taste TERRIBLE. Don&#x27;t use it without brushing first either for the same reason. I learned this the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using this rinse at night to force me not to eat a late-night snack.  I didn&#x27;t experience any of the soothing effects of the rinse.  The inclusion of chamomile doesn&#x27;t make sense to me since you aren&#x27;t drinking the rinse.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this oral rinse, especially since I had a bit of sensitivity due to an abrasion and was hoping this would soothe and help heal it. The first time I tried it, I wasn’t too impressed. The flavour was an odd sweet minty herbal blend. Swishing it around stung  for a few seconds, but then mellowed, and overall, it made only a minor difference in my discomfort. After a few days, I didn’t notice any increase in healing speed nor reduction of sensitivity--at least not over my normal healing speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also an adverse side effect. Although I didn’t swallow it, there apparently was enough alcohol sugar (sorbitol and xylitol) to cause intestinal distress. It was quite unpleasant, to say the least. Only when I discontinued the oral rinse did the issue abate. So, if you’re sensitive to alcohol sugars, use this with caution.</li>
    <li> *I likTheraBreath Dentist Recommended Soothing Oral Rinse- Natural Chamomile Flavor, 16 ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not much on using mouthwashes, but this one might change my mind.  This one soothes my teeth and gums and makes my breath feel fresh.  My girlfriend also appreciates it. if you know what I ,mean.&lt;br /&gt;\&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HE GUNNER  JULY, 2015&lt;br /&gt;e this mouth rinse.To me it is worth the money.  what more can you say about a product?</li>
    <li> The new TheraBreath Soothing Oral Rinse is indeed soothing. It has Aloe, Chamomile, Xylitol and Oatmeal extract among other ingredients. It has a very pleasant taste and your gums will feel refreshed. That being said, it was designed to help reduce stains and slight discomfort. It is Not designed to reduce plaque or bacteria, nor will it help with sore gums. While it is a good product and does soothe the gums, you will need to look elsewhere if you are having gum issues. This is a somewhat pricey product for something that doesn&#x27;t do much. Sore gums are generally caused by bacteria or plaque and require a dentist&#x27;s care. A good herbal Oral Rinse like Jason&#x27;s Healthy  Mouth or mouthwash that reduce plaque and bacteria or gingivitis would be a better option (without alcohol). If you don&#x27;t have major gum issues, this is good product, with good ingredients. Still a bit costly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I also don&#x27;t like it that much.  For me the biggest deterrent was the taste.  I knew it was going to have a &amp;#34;natural flavor&amp;#34;, but something was just off and left a bad aftertaste. As for effectiveness? After trying it out for a week as directed I didn&#x27;t notice any less sensitivity, but there was definitely a soothing effect for up to 20 minutes after using it.  Overall while this is probably very effective for some and the taste is just what they want, for me it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll continue using.</li>
