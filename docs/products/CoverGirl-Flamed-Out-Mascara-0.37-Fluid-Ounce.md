      <li>:-P</li>
      <li>formula itself is good, but CoverGirl needs to improve the brush.</li>
      <li>Good Mascara and no clumping that is all i need.</li>
      <li>and this one looks really good</li>
      <li>This had a good price on it, so I bought a couple.  </li>
      <li>This mascara is another good offering from CoverGirl.  </li>
      <li>The Good:  </li>
      <li>This is a good mascara.</li>
      <li>, I was able to apply the mascara and it was very nice and did the job as advertised.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>The hold it does for my eyelashes is amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with how this mascara looks or the brush.</li>
      <li>All in all a really nice mascara for the price.</li>
      <li>Nice mascara, that coats my lashes with ease.  </li>
      <li>good job, cover girl :)</li>

      <li>again, a brilliant cosmetics find can make a girl feel pretty damned royal.  </li>
      <li>But, the end product really looks great.  </li>
      <li>Just okay.</li>
      <li>I love that there were no lumps or clumps as well.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Mascara is not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>FREE!</li>
      <li>there’s more:  </li>
      <li>Makes my lashes even longer and more voluptuous&lt;</li>
      <li>More blobs stuck in the bristles.  </li>
      <li>brush is not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I like this better because the brush is fuller bristle brush and not the plastic brushes that you get with the Lash Blast.</li>
      <li>It makes your lashes darker, bolder, more voluminous and longer.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>My lashes look fabulous!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Cover Girl has done much  better.</li>
      <li>I love the way my eyelashes look with this mascara</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, it wore well without smudging, it went on okay without clumping.</li>
      <li>Cover Girl is usually a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cover Girl Flamed Out is as good or better than many high end mascaras that I have tried - and I have tried a lot.</li>
      <li>But, I tried it for a very special occasion</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clump, and stays on for many hours.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found surprising about this product: it comes out of the tube cleanly and really does go on without clumping!</li>
      <li>It ran way too easily and hence caused a bit of itching and irritation.</li>
      <li>It does not clump or flake and comes off easily with soap, water or make up remover.  </li>
      <li>(and if it does I easily wipe it off with a q tip).</li>
      <li>As far as drugstore mascaras go, this is one of the better ones, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mascara on a budget.</li>
      <li>I guess it does volumize because it manages to clump your eyelashes together pretty effectively.</li>
      <li>The applicator is amazing, because it works great whether you are right or left handed.  </li>
      <li>is that the tube seemed to &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; much more quickly than what I am used to.</li>
      <li>That in itself is a huge  plus.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as fantastic as it looked.  </li>
      <li>It went on smooth and even.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, with no clumping or pulling of lashes.  </li>
      <li>Also, there is no gluten information available for this on the website, so if that&#x27;s an issue, this is not for you.</li>
      <li>Also, I very rarely apply mascara to my lower lashes.</li>
      <li>The formula is most important to me, and I got exactly what I like.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed upon opening it was the Most Bizarre Brush...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny, cheap mascara has always done so much better for me</li>
      <li>Its my new favorite!</li>
      <li>I have to clean a lot of the product off the applicator before I can apply it</li>
      <li>I would buy it again if I got another super cheap deal on it</li>
      <li>I think for me, this product works about as good or better, than any of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>The mascara itself is nothing special, so there is no reason for me to recommend this.</li>
      <li>There is nothing special at all about this mascara</li>
      <li>They look full, smoldering, sultry, and stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a good mascara.</li>
      <li>It had a nice &#x27;natural&#x27; look, which I don&#x27;t think is what it was going for, but worked.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t bleed or flake; it lasted the full 6 hours of the holiday party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really lengthens my lashes and I love using the tip to touch up the ends, which makes them look even longer.</li>
      <li>I held it various ways and didn&#x27;t get a good result</li>
      <li>Unless you want to spend a good 5 minutes scraping product from the brush so you can apply it without massive clumps - stay away.  </li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s not bad and I will finish up the tube.</li>
      <li>I personally experienced zero clumping as other&#x27;s did; I have no idea why my application didn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>I thought it must surely have some innovative edge that would leave my lashes looking larger than life.</li>
      <li>I feel like the Flamed Out mascara quickly thickens my lashes.  </li>
      <li>After seeing the Capital Collection commercials, I was pretty excited to try out this mascara.</li>
      <li>I even checked in my hand-held mirror to make sure!</li>
      <li>At first I was unconvinced by it, but I really do think it helps the mascara quickly build volume quickly and easily without accidentally getting mascara all over my eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just stick with what works, the Colossal Volume I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
      <li>I was never crazy about CG products but this one goes to the trash after a couple of uses.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>Many other mascaras for the money that are much better.  </li>
      <li>I have long eye lashes to begin with and this mascara makes them look even longer and more voluptuous!</li>
      <li>Mascara is just the right formula for my lashes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i bought this exact same mascara in another store tho but i just wanted to say that i really like it and it makes my lashes longer with volume and thicker</li>
    <li> I really hate it when mascara is clumped before it ever makes it onto your lashes. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found surprising about this product: it comes out of the tube cleanly and really does go on without clumping! So far I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with the results and will recommend it to others who seem to have the same issues I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> This is the first mascara that doesn’t leave a tattoo of sludge beneath my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I tried Covergirl Flamed Out Mascara I tried to find a solution and looked on line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, mascara gunk beneath the eyes is common because I found many suggestions and ideas.  I thought some were time consuming and unreasonable. One solution was to hold a tissue under your lower lashes as you apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl Flamed Out Mascara turned out to be what I was seeking.&lt;br /&gt;No mess and no weird tricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s more:  I’ve been out for hours in wind and fog and it’s stayed where I put it over 12 hours ago…on my lashes…not my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara comes in a chubby, hot pink tube with a weird wavy hour-glass-figure shaped brush that goes in when it should go out but somehow works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> The wand is quite large, so I had to be careful that I only applied it to my lashes and not my lids.  My lashes did appear fuller and prettier. However, after a few hours, I had raccoon eyes. It ran way too easily and hence caused a bit of itching and irritation.</li>
    <li> This is mascara. It will make your eyelashes black. That&#x27;s about it. I have light brown eyelashes, and not a whole lot of them, and this stuff didn&#x27;t make them appear thicker than they are. It did make them darker, which was great, but I can get that from any mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what advantage the shape of the brush is supposed to give, but I didn&#x27;t find it any better than my regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, for a product like this, you might as well buy one of the cheap brands (Wet and Wild, ELF, etc.) It&#x27;s just mascara.</li>
    <li> If this mascara didn&#x27;t clump I would have given it 5 stars. The shape of the brush causes the mascara&lt;br /&gt;to build up in the bristles. Because of this, the amount of mascara on the brush is too thick when&lt;br /&gt;applying it to the lashes. I tried cleaning the brush off with a tissue and starting fresh, but it didn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;due to the design of the brush. I actually used a brush from another mascara and that worked better.&lt;br /&gt;The formula itself is good, but CoverGirl needs to improve the brush.</li>
    <li> This mascara seemed barely there, no matter how I tried to build it up. It also didn&#x27;t seem to last very long and it didn&#x27;t curl the lashes.</li>
    <li> I was rally impressed with this product. The mascara went on very nicely and my lashes were plumped and defined. I love that there were no lumps or clumps as well. The applicator brush is an hour glass shape. I didn&#x27;t find it difficult to use but it is definitely different.  I normally use Cover Girl Lash Blast (orange tube) or Cover Girl Clump Crusher (green tube) and I would say this Flame Out Mascara is in line with those products. I will definitely will be purchasing and using this mascara again.</li>
    <li> happy kid im a mascara only tape of gal and this one looks really good</li>
    <li> Either I got a defective tube or this is just the worst mascara EVER!  I like the idea of the shaped brush and all but there is WAY too much product left on the brush when you pull it from the tube.  There is supposed to be a scraping device inside that leaves only an appropriate amount on the brush but not in this one.  It&#x27;s completely unusable.  Unless you want to spend a good 5 minutes scraping product from the brush so you can apply it without massive clumps - stay away.  I use other CG mascara and quite like it, this is just a bad one.</li>
    <li> CG Flamed Out Mascara is just the right formula for my lashes.  It goes on smoothly, with no clumping or pulling of lashes.  One or two strokes with the brush is all I required for thicker and longer looking lashes.  I think I have finally found just what I was looking for in a mascara.</li>
    <li> This is a very good mascara. It goes on thick and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> After seeing the Capital Collection commercials, I was pretty excited to try out this mascara. I thought it must surely have some innovative edge that would leave my lashes looking larger than life. Sadly, even with the slightly different shaped wanded, this mascara is just another repackaged version of the same ole&#x27;, same ole&#x27; stuff I&#x27;ve been buying for years. It&#x27;s black. It flakes a little. It smears under your lids after a night out. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my carbon black Voluminous. At least, it doesn&#x27;t clump as much. Someday, the perfect mascara will come. Still waiting.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the negative reviews are about! I get long thick fanned out lashes with this mascara and brush, the kind I get when putting on an expensive department store mascara. It stays on all day and goes on fast, I don&#x27;t have to build it up as much as other brands to get length and fullness. It doesn&#x27;t have clumps and it doesn&#x27;t get on my skin when I apply it (and if it does I easily wipe it off with a q tip). Its my new favorite! P.S. purchased from store, not amazon</li>
    <li> The brush makes it where I couldn&#x27;t get mascara on my lashes without clumps. The point is blunt and it causes a problem. The mascara itsself is very clumpy, but the applicator is the worst part of it. I do not recommend this type and I usually like Cover Girl products.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this brand of mascara, I must admit I&#x27;m disappointed in myself for not trying this sooner. The brush is so soft, it doesn&#x27;t scratch my eyelids like the previous mascara did. The hold it does for my eyelashes is amazing. I love the way my eyelashes look with this mascara</li>
    <li> Was hard to apply when the mascara is unevenly distributed on the applicator brush.  Very, very clumpy in parts which makes it difficult to apply without getting it on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you use an eyelash curler like I do, this mascara did not work with it at all.  Lashes went flat immediately.</li>
    <li> I am truly puzzled about the shape of this brush. I held it various ways and didn&#x27;t get a good result however I applied it to my lashes. Just got clumpy lashes and gobs of mascara. I&#x27;ve been using mascara for several decades and have never had such a  hard to use brush. The mascara itself is nothing special, so there is no reason for me to recommend this. Cover Girl has done much  better.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-50s and have a slow thyroid, so one of things I&#x27;ve discovered is that my eyelashes are not as naturally thick as they used to be. I need mascara to make what sparse lashes I do have look as thick as possible. I normally use the Maybelline line of mascara. I&#x27;ve found most &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; mascaras have a very thin brush with very short bristles, that puts hardly any product on the lashes - unless one can manage to put on 4 or 5 coats. I don&#x27;t have time for that. The Maybelline line of products have stuck to the fuller brushes, which make it easier to apply mascara to more sparse lashes, such as my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, when I opened up this tube of CoverGirl Flamed Out Mascara, I was pleasantly surprised to find a fuller brush. I was more than a bit confused at the hour glass design, though. I&#x27;m not exactly sure what that is supposed to achieve. When I first brought the wand out of the tube, my first thought was, &amp;#34;Yikes, this is going to be a gloppy mess!&amp;#34; It looked thick, and gloppy, and really, really black. But, as a Vine member, one has to try these things. So, I applied it and I was amazed that the product did not clump on at all! It went on smooth and even. I even checked in my hand-held mirror to make sure! No clumps, nothing uneven. All the lashes from end to end were covered beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have stated the product got on their skin, but I didn&#x27;t experience this. Perhaps it did, but I use a very dark brown eye liner and apply that before using mascara, so perhaps it blended in? Also, I very rarely apply mascara to my lower lashes. I do so one time with this product, and did not experience and transference. So I don&#x27;t understand other reviewers problems with the brush, but it may have something to do with what one might be used to. Going from a brush that is narrow/skimpy to one that is fuller takes a little bit of adjusting, I suppose? Not sure. I guess it comes down to personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I could come up with is that the tube seemed to &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; much more quickly than what I am used to. Normally, my mascaras can last 2 months. This tube seemed to be used up by a month. Hence, 4 stars instead of 5. I have not always been a fan of Cover Girl mascaras, because I didn&#x27;t like the wands which were too skinny/skimpy for my lashes. This one I like, and I will probably seek this out for purchase.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as fantastic as it looked.  Many other mascaras for the money that are much better.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t appear to make my lashes any fuller.  It does make them a bit longer, but nothing compared to other mascaras from the drug store.  I find the brush extremely odd and awkward to use.  It&#x27;s also really dry as compared to other mascaras.  This was just not a winner for me.</li>
    <li> I really regret buy this mascara. It&#x27;s just awful. It&#x27;s hard to apply because the brush makes your lashes stick together and after a couple of hours it starts to flake off. I bought the waterproof one and it is in no way water proof. I wish I returned it but too late now. I&#x27;ll never be buying this again.</li>
    <li> The first time I took it out of the tube the tip was just blobbled with mascara, more than any other I&#x27;ve ever used.  More blobs stuck in the bristles.  I tried and tried to get some of mascara off the brush, but it was still too blobby, and went on very clumpy.  I wore it once, and it just didn&#x27;t do a thing for my long, but light lashes.  Threw this out after one wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and won&#x27;t buy this or recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with how this mascara looks or the brush. There is nothing special at all about this mascara and it seems to flake.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara, that coats my lashes with ease.  Like any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought, there&#x27;s a bit to scrape off at the tip, so not to cause clumps.  Still, I have to be careful, or it can get a bit much on my lashes.  The curve, actually makes it easier to distribute across my lashes.  Sure, there can be a bit of getting to much on and having  a few lashes stick together, but I&#x27;ve actually experienced less of that with this brand.  At the end of the day, it washes off nice and doesn&#x27;t leave smudges under my lower lids.  That in itself is a huge  plus.&lt;br /&gt; I think for me, this product works about as good or better, than any of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> When i read the reviews of this, I was a little terrified. What I didn&#x27;t need was another messy, clumpy mascara. I&#x27;m very picky about mascara, i like good definition and length but don&#x27;t want to look like a drag queen. This is very nice...I did get a few clumps when I first started using it - but I just cleaned that up with another mascara wand. The formula is most important to me, and I got exactly what I like. All in all a really nice mascara for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a bit wary of Covergirl products, but this mascara does everything you would want it to do. It makes your lashes darker, bolder, more voluminous and longer. It lasted a long time (almost the entire day) and didn&#x27;t smear or rub off easily. As far as drugstore mascaras go, this is one of the better ones, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mascara on a budget. But be aware that it is VERY dark, and possibly not the best choice for blondes.</li>
    <li> I have the thinnest, wimpiest eyelashes in the world, and this mascara builds color and length.  The applicator is amazing, because it works great whether you are right or left handed.  It does not clump or flake and comes off easily with soap, water or make up remover.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, the brush is weird.  I ended up with too much mascara on some lashes and not enough on others.  Trying to apply it to my bottom lashes; forget about it.  Also, I found the mascara very hard to get off.  I could get it off my eyelashes but it would sit under my eyes a la raccoon.  And it would still be there the next morning.  CoverGirl has made some great mascara... this just is not one of them.</li>
    <li> This mascara is another good offering from CoverGirl.  I previously tried and liked the Lash Blast.  I like this better because the brush is fuller bristle brush and not the plastic brushes that you get with the Lash Blast. I feel like the Flamed Out mascara quickly thickens my lashes.  The brush has an odd hourglass shape.  At first I was unconvinced by it, but I really do think it helps the mascara quickly build volume quickly and easily without accidentally getting mascara all over my eyelid.  I like that the brush is nice and fluffy but not TOO big like the vintage Urban Decay Big Fatty or Smashbox Full Exposure. Also, unlike mascaras with u-shaped wands (e.g., Urban Decay Super Curl), I don&#x27;t bump it all over my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara has a dryer formula.  The plus is that I am less prone to splash it onto my eyelid (which happens with wet mascaras over the first few weeks of use, before they dry out a bit).  However, with this dryer formula, I wonder if the mascara will get clumpy after 2 months of use.  I have only used it for a month, so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see whether or not there is significant clumping issues towards the end of its life span.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is nice and black (yay!).  I only use black mascara and I think the deep color adds to the thickening effect. Although the packaging does not say that it is waterproof, it stays on very nicely.  Personally, I have not experienced any smudging (thankfully, I rarely experience this, however, so take that comment with a grain of salt!) and I find it a bit harder to remove compared to some other non-waterproof mascaras.  Not too hard though... For reference, I prefer non-waterproof mascaras most of the time because I hate having to deal with panda eyes after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover Girl Flamed Out is as good or better than many high end mascaras that I have tried - and I have tried a lot. I would definitely consider purchasing it in the future (although I still want to try Maybelline The Rocket).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  As expected, this did get clumpy.  For the price, it&#x27;s ok, but this really lasts only 4-6 weeks, not 3 months like other mascaras.line The Rocket).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  As expected, this did get clumpy.  For the price, it&#x27;s ok, but this really lasts only 4-6 weeks, not 3 months like other mascaras.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever paid for. It&#x27;s chalky, and simply does nothing for my lashes. The worst worst WORST part is that if I merely shed a drop of moisture from my eyes, the mascara burns like crazy. It also does not last. By the end of the day, I have raccoon eyes (may sound and look funny, but this girl is not pleased) because the product smears. Not worth it all...</li>
    <li> I really like the brush on this mascara. I will be buying it again. My lashes actually do look longer and no clumps. I don&#x27;t go for volume I go for length. Good Mascara and no clumping that is all i need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been A Cover Girl Mascara Grrrl since I began wearing make up at age 14 years old. I started with the classic Pink &amp; Green Tube and for the past several years, I&#x27;ve changed to the yellow Colossal Volume Express. I&#x27;ve been SO pleased with Cover Girl Mascara that I never had the need to look at any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when this \\&quot;New &amp; Improved\\&quot; version was offered, (with !FREE! tie-in to the Hunger Games movie--Whoopdiedoo), I jumped at giving it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh. The first thing I noticed upon opening it was the Most Bizarre Brush...EVER!!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU TO DO WITH IT?????? No matter HOW I tried to hold it or use it, it surpassed this old gal&#x27;s learning curve! I finally tossed the brush after getting mascara over all my eye lid&#x27;s surfaces but barely on the lashes! Stupid brush! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a sterilized Cover Girl mascara brush from a tube that was almost done, I was able to apply the mascara and it was very nice and did the job as advertised. I personally experienced zero clumping as other&#x27;s did; I have no idea why my application didn&#x27;t clump. But, I tried it for a very special occasion and it didn&#x27;t bleed or flake; it lasted the full 6 hours of the holiday party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the rest of this tube up but I&#x27;d never buy it, again. I&#x27;ll just stick with what works, the Colossal Volume I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a good mascara. The brush is not low-quality, and you don&#x27;t need several applications to see the result. It does smudge a bit if you wear it all day long but, on the positive side, this mascara is very easy to remove. Definitely a product to consider if you are on a tighter budget.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. Its very dark and covers very well. My lashes look fabulous!</li>
    <li> The Good:  this is a somewhat better than average mascara--it goes on very cleanly, it doesn&#x27;t visibly flake over time, and it&#x27;s not goopy when first applied.  Also, if you&#x27;re really nearsighted, as I am, this is pretty easy to apply because the brush is so big you&#x27;ll be able to see what you&#x27;re doing from a few feet away. This also isn&#x27;t heavy on the allergens; it&#x27;s not painful to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  you can&#x27;t nap or sleep in it because it smears.  Also, there is no gluten information available for this on the website, so if that&#x27;s an issue, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> For something called flamed out, it really didn&#x27;t ignite a fire in my heart for this product. It&#x27;s not terrible, it wore well without smudging, it went on okay without clumping. I found the mascara itself to be a little dry, so it didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as it could have, but the drier texture also meant it didn&#x27;t get everywhere while I was applying. It had a nice &#x27;natural&#x27; look, which I don&#x27;t think is what it was going for, but worked. I don&#x27;t mind the brush shape, it actually reminds me of a few high end products that recently came out, (which is why I chose this actually, it&#x27;s a fraction of a similarly brushed mascaras cost). But, really, the hourglass shape isn&#x27;t doing anything for my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;All in all there are better alternatives at a similar price point, so I&#x27;ll be keeping up the search and trying something new. But, it&#x27;s not bad and I will finish up the tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many CoverGirl products including several of their mascaras. This has a bulky brush, with a wide tip, and I found it hard to use to apply it to my lashes. Because it is wide at the tip, it kept smudging, then I&#x27;d have to use a Q-tip to remove the smudge and start over. I switched to another brush I had that had a slimmer tip-head on it. It is still goopy however, and I don&#x27;t like that either. I have to clean a lot of the product off the applicator before I can apply it and it takes some practice to avoid clumps. It is not a waterproof product either and my allergy-eyes tear a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like CoverGirls Lash Exact, Waterproof. The brush is smallish and easy to apply without gooping, but it has a down side... it&#x27;s hard to remove at the end of the day. I&#x27;ve even lost some lashes to that task, and believe me, I don&#x27;t have any to spare. That is why I was looking for a replacement product and thought I&#x27;d try this when it was offered to me through the Vine program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this through Amazon Vine&#x27;s program for my unbiased review, which is what you are getting here. I cannot recommend this to anyone who wants to avoid goop and clumps.</li>
    <li> I recently had a head shot taken and had my makeup professionally applied. The make up artist used a mascara brush similar to this style brush on the CoverGirl 300 Flamed Out Mascara. I was cynical at first seeing the brush, but after using it, I&#x27;m sold. It really lengthens my lashes and I love using the tip to touch up the ends, which makes them look even longer. I would definitely recommend this mascara!</li>
    <li> CoverGirl 300 Flamed Out Mascara is not my favorite.  The brush is stubby and the hourglass shape makes applying the mascara difficult.  The mascara itself is thick and clumps on the brush; my eyelashes often end up sticking together and I inevitably get some on my eyelids.  The mascara does not hold the curl of an eyelash curler very well.  The Very Black Blaze color is nice and the formula is long lasting; the mascara is easy to remove.  I&#x27;ll use the remainder of the tube since I have it but I won&#x27;t get another one.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara.  When I&#x27;m done applying it, my lashes look full and very long.  The Very Black color is perfectly black and really shows off my brown eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is not my favorite.  It&#x27;s a little hard for me to get my corner lashes done.  But, the end product really looks great.  So, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smudges and no flakes.  And my eyes don&#x27;t get irritated.  This is a good mascara.</li>
    <li> i tried this mascara on a whim. i love trying new make-up products, especially mascaras. i&#x27;m pleased with the results. the brush takes getting used to but the shape helps cover hard-to-reach areas like the inner and outer lashes. the formula is the best part. it covers well, volumizes, and best of all, there is virtually no flaking or smudging. i wore this stuff to bed and was surprised to wake up and find no raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;give this stuff a shot. if you don&#x27;t like it, you can always return it. good job, cover girl :)</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered on time, thank u</li>
    <li> This mascara really delivers as promised. I have totally flamed out, black, thick, and lush lashes this morning as I type this.  My lashes have not looked this great for YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;What an advance in mascara! I love it!  I have found my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; mascara and I am glad that it is Cover Girl, as I have sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t afford an infection. Therefore I do take the advice to replace mascara on a regular basis seriously.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is not that expensive, and so you can throw it out in a timely fashion, replacing it (as you should) for the sake of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Why spend tons of money on mascara when you are not going to be able to use it beyond a few months?&lt;br /&gt;Back to the performance of this brand, CoverGirl 300 Flamed Out Mascara:&lt;br /&gt;Oh, am I a believer! Give me somewhere to go now so I can show off my lashes! They look full, smoldering, sultry, and stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the teeny problem I mentioned, coming up however. It is an engineering problem. A problem of applicator design.&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that due to the shape of the brush, the very shape that makes this such a great mascara for your top lashes, you are going to have to do some fancy eye-hand coodination moves when applying this to your lower eyelashes. The brush is just not designed to work as well with your lower lashes. I can live with this, consdering the way my upper lashes look after single and double applications of this faboo mascara however. Thanks, Covergirl, you aced it!&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
    <li> I have long but fine lashes, and this mascara is absolutely terrific. No, it doesn&#x27;t make them look the ones on TV (have you noticed how nearly all of those ads now have little disclaimers about the models wearing lash extensions/additions?) but they are much more noticeable with this than with any other mascara I have ever used. No problems with clumps, although the wand could be a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> The product leaves your lashes very hard, brittle, and spiky with little clumps.  I do not like this formula and threw it out, it was so bad.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t every girl dream of finding a product that will transform her from a Plain Jane to a Bodacious Bombshell?  It&#x27;s not our fault.  After all, we were weaned on stories about average girls transformed into princesses.  Snow White.  Cinderella.  They ruined us, didn&#x27;t they?  The reality is we can&#x27;t all be princesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, a brilliant cosmetics find can make a girl feel pretty damned royal.  At least, that&#x27;s how I feel about CoverGirl 300 Flamed Out Mascara.  This mascara transformed my blonde eyelashes into long, thick sexy bombshell lashes.  It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clump, and stays on for many hours.</li>
    <li> I found this mascara to be the best yet of all that I have tried (including very expensive Lancome brand). No clumping whatsoever (my lashes are fairly long, but stick straight like Asian lashes) which is a rarity in the mascara I&#x27;ve used lately. It also removed easily with my facial cleanser, and didn&#x27;t give me &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; underneath my eye area the way other brands have done in the past. After curling my lashes, one coat felt like plenty (and my lashes were hitting the inside of my eyeglass lenses) so that was perfect for me. It&#x27;s funny, cheap mascara has always done so much better for me, I think I&#x27;ve learned my lesson now and will stay out of the department stores for mascara. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the greatest mascara ever, but I got it on sale with a coupon which made it like two bucks so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. It&#x27;s not clumpy or terrible or anything, just got pretty average results out of it. I would buy it again if I got another super cheap deal on it but it&#x27;s not worth full price. Just okay.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried. There are giant globs the stick to the way too short brush, and the wand stays about 90% dry. I guess it does volumize because it manages to clump your eyelashes together pretty effectively.</li>
    <li> I love this product! This is my 10th one I&#x27;ve owned and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other mascara. I personally like a full, dramatic lash and this product really delivers! The wand is shaped to really get all your lashes coated well. I like to apply multiple layers for a thicker look. This allows to do just that without clumping! I get compliments on my lashes all the time.. People even ask if they are fake! Would recommend to those ladies looking for a dramatic, beautiful lash!</li>
    <li> The mascara is maybe not half bad, but my goodness I&#x27;ve had the worst allergic reaction to it and I&#x27;ve never been allergic to makeup in my life! My eyes were tearing up and itching so bad I literally felt like scratching them out! I was never crazy about CG products but this one goes to the trash after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> One of my fave mascaras</li>
    <li> This is the first mascara I have ever been allergic to.  As far as I am aware it is the only thing I am allergic to.  Would definitely not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of most CG mascaras as of late and was super excited to try this one. Unfortunately, it severely sucks. The length of the actual &#x27;&#x27;hourglass&#x27;&#x27; brush is way too short and does nothing to accentuate the lashes on an eye...it is so short it doesn&#x27;t even follow the shape of the lash line, which makes it extremely awkward to apply, and I ended up getting mascara all over my eyelid. Second, the bristles are of a widely-spaced spiral nature circa 1982, so it misses like half of your lashes per swipe. Third, the formula is dry and kind of sticky, so my lashes were totally sticking together. I also didn&#x27;t notice any lengthening qualities. Just do yourself a favor and pass on this one!  :-P</li>
    <li> The worst mascara I&#x27;ve used in a very long time!!  It *HAS* to be bad for me to use my personal time to go online and add a negative review!  But I&#x27;d like for no one else to go through what I&#x27;ve been through and for the company to either reformulate it or pull it off the shelves.  Cover Girl is usually a pretty good product. This had a good price on it, so I bought a couple.  Aside from the fact that it is very mediocre as far as adding volume or length, after a couple of hours of wearing it, it begins to flake off....where? Oh yes....IN YOUR EYE!!!  I wondered if I was having a reaction to something else but no....this has only happened to me when I&#x27;m wearing this mascara and it happened every...single...time.  It resulted in blood shot eyes, extreme irritation &amp; itching and PAIN!!!  It last for hours.  The only thing that would relieve the itching &amp; pain was a hot shower, washing my eyes out well and going to bed.  I pitched it in the trash.  Its simply horrible.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mascara after absolutely HAAAATING my last mascara (also drug store bought). I will admit- I didn&#x27;t think I would like this and planned on buying a more expensive brand of mascara shortly after this. But, I can say I am pleasantly surprised with this mascara and how it makes my lashes look. I have long eye lashes to begin with and this mascara makes them look even longer and more voluptuous! It really separates my lashes and makes them look fuller and sort of cat-eye like, without having to wear false lashes (which, i will admit, i never have worn before). It is a great store-bought mascara that I will continue to buy for years!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price- well priced for a great mascara&lt;br /&gt;2. Makes my lashes even longer and more voluptuous&lt;br /&gt;3. No clumping &amp; does not go on super wet (you know, so wet that your lashes clump together and you look like you only have 5 lashes total)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. None!</li>
</ol>
