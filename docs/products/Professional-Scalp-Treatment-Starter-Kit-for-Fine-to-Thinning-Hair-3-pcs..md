      <li>I am glad I found this, as I believe it is going to help me recover a great deal of hair.  </li>
      <li>And it kind of burns.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and tingle of the product, it feels very refreshing when washing it out.</li>
      <li>ALSO very important WASH</li>
      <li>I love the menthol smell and feel on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I do not know for sure if it is</li>
      <li>and she \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; took off 6 more inches than she was supposed to</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and my hair has more body.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic....</li>
      <li>but as of right now it is not looking good....</li>
      <li>This treatment is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I just keep it to 2-3 minutes and it is fine.  </li>
      <li>and it always takes a huge toll on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I was ok with that willing to take the discomfort for some hair...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>Minty and clean feeling.</li>
      <li>BRIGHT RED</li>
      <li>If they had a sensitive skin formula that was paraban-free and effective, it may garner a four or five star rating.</li>
      <li>I used to shed alot of hair before I started using this product, but I&#x27;m happy to see that now my hair loss is back to normal after just 3 weeks and my hair is noticeably longer.</li>
      <li>We have even mentioned it to some of our friends who have been complaining of receeding hairlines, and they are interested!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s absolutely worth giving it a try for yourselves.  </li>
      <li>First thing I did notice was the tingling others had describe and</li>
      <li>However, I can&#x27;t say for sure that it was all the shampoo given my changing medical situation.  </li>
      <li>The serum is best not applied standing up, I learned the hard way, because it runs all over the face which left my forehead, eyelids, cheeks and chin bright red and burned looking, as well as physically a burning sensation.</li>
      <li>When I left the formulas in my hair for minutes as the instructions recommend, I did experience a strong tingling that, after the shower, turned into a burning sensation.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any kind of difference, for the price I was really let down.</li>
      <li>It really helps my hair</li>
      <li>I used to be a hair stylist and cosmetologist, I am always willing to try and share new products.</li>
      <li>I bought two of these kits and paid $8.00 more for one than the other on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I certainly noticed a lot of new hair growth.  </li>
      <li>and it did not grow back as full as it was before chemo</li>
      <li>Better yet, ask someone to apply it for you when you&#x27;re lying down so you can focus on protecting your face.</li>
      <li>Left hair feeling coated and dry - doing its own thing, While drying my hair immediately after shampoo, conditioner and serum, I had more hair loss than I had in several days prior using Nioxin 2.</li>
      <li>At the very worst, this is a pricier volumizing shampoo, conditioner and serum (really does make hair look and feel significantly thicker) and at the very best it may have really impacted my hair regrowth.  </li>
      <li>You must keep using it for every shampoo as directed, I have lots of new hair growing</li>
      <li>I went to a new stylist to cut my hair</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be more careful the next time.</li>
      <li>Not really any different than Nioxin, from what I can tell, although maybe smells a bit more medicinal.  </li>
      <li>I just finished my first set and am reordering a second!</li>
      <li>I have curly hair that can get dried out easily, and these products provide the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down, which I really like.</li>
      <li>Would definitely not waste my money again.</li>
      <li>It is not harsh.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sticking it out until the end to give this product a chance to WOW me</li>
      <li>Something lots of health conscious women like me want to avoid.</li>
      <li>With knowing several of the ingredients in the shampoo, I know its the real deal, plus all that tingling helps with the circulation which also promotes health hair growth.</li>
      <li>Bottom line: if you have sensitive skin, use with caution or avoid altogether.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The reason I give it three stars is because of the harshness of the product and there being no warning for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, my forehead was raw and bright red after using these products.</li>
      <li>After losing a noticeable amount of hair for medical reasons, and as a female in my 20s, I was ready to try anything!  </li>
      <li>I was confused and believed that one was a bit more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; than the other and worth the extra money.  </li>
      <li>Secondly, this is marketed as a natural product but contains parabans that are endocrine disrupters.</li>

<li> Needless to say I was willing to try anything to help the growth of my new short haircut.</li>
<li> cause it doesn&#x27;t detangle my long hair.  </li>
<li> The conditioner does start to burn if you leave it on too long.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for about three weeks (every other day) and I am seeing new growth and a lot less hair loss.  </li>
<li> Sometimes herbal formulas can dry the hair, so Argan oil can help with that.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found simply leaving the shampoo and conditioner in briefly avoids the harsh burning effect.</li>
<li> an hour every single time to go away after my shower.</li>
<li> Every single part of my body this product touched turned a flaming reds</li>
<li> Second the bottle States that you skin may turn a little red but will go away in a few minutes...</li>
<li> I have thin hair and this makes it feel much thicker.</li>
<li> I have used this ever since I lost my hair due to chemo</li>
<li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he was complaining that all the other shampoos and conditioners for his thinning hair did not make a difference.</li>
<li> You use only a small amount of each product.    </li>
<li> and after I brush my hair and any other timeni have my hands in my hair</li>
<li> after you use the serum it will also burn other peoples skin</li>
<li> Anyway, they were identical except one came packaged in a box and the other didn&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> I have been losing my hair at a rapid rate due to having a baby</li>
<li> What I suggest is laying down when applying the serum and put a washcloth over your face to avoid it spilling down.</li>
<li> Have used the 3 products  together for less than a month.  </li>
<li> Not even a little bit.  </li>
<li> After a few washes, my hair seems thicker.</li>
<li> The little bottle it comes with is sorta pointless in my case.</li>
<li> The smell and peppermint feel of this treatment at least gives me a feeling this is working.</li>
<li> it gives your hair this greasy dirty hard to brush texture and it lasts all day long.</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> I bought this because I have really thin hair and wanted help.  </li>
<li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner make my scalp feel weird.</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> Very irritating to the skin and uncomfortable.</li>
<li> The hormonal changes makes my hair fall out like crazy.  </li>
<li> so I was desperate for something to help me</li>
<li> Made my scalp itch like crazy.</li>
<li> so I was desperate to try something in addition to supplements I&#x27;m taking like Biotin and vitamins/minerals.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m honestly afraid to stop using it for fear of losing hair again.</li>
<li> if her skin got burned I would be a very angry</li>
<li> Then my hair smelled really bad for the rest of the night.</li>
<li> Felt like an idiot</li>
<li> Terrible purchase.</li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t stop scratching my head - the worst.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought two of these kits and paid $8.00 more for one than the other on Amazon.  I was confused and believed that one was a bit more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; than the other and worth the extra money.  (A woman with thinning hair grasps for straws!).  Anyway, they were identical except one came packaged in a box and the other didn&#x27;t.  Felt like an idiot and I&#x27;ll be more careful the next time.</li>
    <li> The smell and peppermint feel of this treatment at least gives me a feeling this is working. I do not know for sure if it is but I like how it makes my hair feel when I shampoo. I have thin hair and this makes it feel much thicker.</li>
    <li> This product works PERIOD! -I would have been almost bald without this. If you are thinning.. get this and save yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he was complaining that all the other shampoos and conditioners for his thinning hair did not make a difference. After reading the reviews on Murad I was sold, and hoped he would like it. He loves this set, and says it is the best one out of the dozens he has tried. His hair looks and feels thicker. We have even mentioned it to some of our friends who have been complaining of receeding hairlines, and they are interested! I say its a definite MUST to try out!</li>
    <li> This treatment is easy to use.  You use only a small amount of each product.    I see results after only a week.  My hair looks and feels fuller.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years It really helps my hair</li>
    <li> I do not seem to see any drastic results i have used up 2 bottles of the serum, hoping for some miracle to happen.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about this product after reading reviews about it burning scalps. I have sensitive skin. A health issue and stress led to hair thinning and some loss so I was desperate to try something in addition to supplements I&#x27;m taking like Biotin and vitamins/minerals. When I left the formulas in my hair for minutes as the instructions recommend, I did experience a strong tingling that, after the shower, turned into a burning sensation. Like other reviewers, my forehead was raw and bright red after using these products. The serum is best not applied standing up, I learned the hard way, because it runs all over the face which left my forehead, eyelids, cheeks and chin bright red and burned looking, as well as physically a burning sensation. Very irritating to the skin and uncomfortable. I used a towel to wipe it off and applied an Ayurvedic healing cream to soothe the burn. What I suggest is laying down when applying the serum and put a washcloth over your face to avoid it spilling down. Better yet, ask someone to apply it for you when you&#x27;re lying down so you can focus on protecting your face. I&#x27;ve found simply leaving the shampoo and conditioner in briefly avoids the harsh burning effect. After a few washes, my hair seems thicker. It has a pleasant smell. I still use a leave in conditioner. Sometimes herbal formulas can dry the hair, so Argan oil can help with that. The conditioner has a lot of alcohol in it which could also be why it&#x27;s drying. The reason I give it three stars is because of the harshness of the product and there being no warning for sensitive skin. Secondly, this is marketed as a natural product but contains parabans that are endocrine disrupters. Something lots of health conscious women like me want to avoid. If they had a sensitive skin formula that was paraban-free and effective, it may garner a four or five star rating. Bottom line: if you have sensitive skin, use with caution or avoid altogether.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any kind of difference, for the price I was really let down. The little bottle it comes with is sorta pointless in my case.</li>
    <li> After losing a noticeable amount of hair for medical reasons, and as a female in my 20s, I was ready to try anything!  I certainly noticed a lot of new hair growth.  However, I can&#x27;t say for sure that it was all the shampoo given my changing medical situation.  At the very worst, this is a pricier volumizing shampoo, conditioner and serum (really does make hair look and feel significantly thicker) and at the very best it may have really impacted my hair regrowth.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s absolutely worth giving it a try for yourselves.  I just finished my first set and am reordering a second!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for about three weeks (every other day) and I am seeing new growth and a lot less hair loss.  I&#x27;ve had three babies and it always takes a huge toll on my hair.  The hormonal changes makes my hair fall out like crazy.  I am glad I found this, as I believe it is going to help me recover a great deal of hair.  The products smells good and leave your hair feeling and looking thicker.  The conditioner does start to burn if you leave it on too long.  I just keep it to 2-3 minutes and it is fine.  i also use an bit of another conditioner after using the murad stuff, cause it doesn&#x27;t detangle my long hair.  I would definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I tried the kit. The shampoo &amp; conditioner make my scalp feel weird. I started itching. My scalp was itching for a while. Then my hair smelled really bad for the rest of the night. I don&#x27;t think I will continue using this product. My hair looks thinner than it did before.</li>
    <li> Have used the 3 products  together for less than a month.  Hair feels great and looks good.  I love the menthol smell and feel on my scalp.  Have yet to see results</li>
    <li> And it kind of burns.  I&#x27;ve noticed no difference at all in volume of thickness.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.  Won&#x27;t invite friends to try it either.  Sorry</li>
    <li> Not really any different than Nioxin, from what I can tell, although maybe smells a bit more medicinal.  I have curly hair that can get dried out easily, and these products provide the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down, which I really like.</li>
    <li> Love it. It is not harsh. Minty and clean feeling.</li>
    <li> You must keep using it for every shampoo as directed, I have lots of new hair growing and my hair has more body.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have really thin hair and wanted help.  I&#x27;ve been using this and the serum on a daily basis for over a month, and have not noticed ANY difference.  Not even a little bit.  Would definitely not waste my money again.</li>
    <li> I used to shed alot of hair before I started using this product, but I&#x27;m happy to see that now my hair loss is back to normal after just 3 weeks and my hair is noticeably longer. Great product and I plan to continue buying it :)</li>
    <li> Made my scalp itch like crazy. Left hair feeling coated and dry - doing its own thing, While drying my hair immediately after shampoo, conditioner and serum, I had more hair loss than I had in several days prior using Nioxin 2. Seriously. Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash this stuff out. Couldn&#x27;t stop scratching my head - the worst. Terrible purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this ever since I lost my hair due to chemo and it did not grow back as full as it was before chemo but this seemed to help. I was told not to try Rogain because of heart palpitations. I&#x27;m honestly afraid to stop using it for fear of losing hair again.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on this product before deciding to purchase it... Here is my feedback on this product and I truly hope it helps.... I have been losing my hair at a rapid rate due to having a baby so I was desperate for something to help me I read raving reviews about this and could not wait to try it out. First thing I did notice was the tingling others had describe and yes it tingles while it also burns a bit I was ok with that willing to take the discomfort for some hair... Second the bottle States that you skin may turn a little red but will go away in a few minutes... Every single part of my body this product touched turned a flaming reds my hands my arms my neck and back my shoulder where my hair sat to let the product work it&#x27;s magic....BRIGHT RED and it tas an hour every single time to go away after my shower. The serum you put in your hair after also turns your skin red but not only does it turn it red it gives your hair this greasy dirty hard to brush texture and it lasts all day long. I cant tell you if I have noticed hair growth but I&#x27;m sticking it out until the end to give this product a chance to WOW me but as of right now it is not looking good.... ALSO very important WASH YOUR HANDS after you use the serum it will also burn other peoples skin I scrub my hands after I apply it and after I brush my hair and any other timeni have my hands in my hair I scrub scrub scrub I have a baby and I&#x27;m pretty sure if her skin got burned I would be a very angry mama.... hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I used to be a hair stylist and cosmetologist, I am always willing to try and share new products. I went to a new stylist to cut my hair and she \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; took off 6 more inches than she was supposed to then I had to get an additional inch off to fix all her mistakes. Needless to say I was willing to try anything to help the growth of my new short haircut. I have only been using this for two weeks but I am already noticing my roots growing in. I love the smell and tingle of the product, it feels very refreshing when washing it out. Im also taking several hair supplements to help the growth but overall I have noticed a difference. With knowing several of the ingredients in the shampoo, I know its the real deal, plus all that tingling helps with the circulation which also promotes health hair growth.</li>
