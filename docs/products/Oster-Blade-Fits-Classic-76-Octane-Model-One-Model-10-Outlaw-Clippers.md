      <li>I will preface my statement by saying I love my Oster clippers and blades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got them online instead of art a beauty style store.</li>

      <li>for the price of one haircut, I was able to cut my hair for over two years :)  love it</li>

      <li>easy to use and attach.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and replace makes clean up fat and easy.</li>
      <li>easy to clean also.</li>
      <li>THEN THE OLDER ONE WE HAD ...COMES NICELY PACKED IN THIS BOX ...</li>
      <li>Be prepared to take it all apart to clean and lubricate if you want them to work.  </li>
      <li>They are very durable, they cut precise and what you see in the picture is what you get delivered.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This trimmer makes nice clean flat cuts so the beard feels much smoother and doesn&#x27;t break off at the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The length is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I was also pleased to find the build quality in this blade no different from the build quality of the blades I purchased fifteen years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR...</li>
      <li>Came fast, fits right, Cuts hubby and our boys hair</li>
      <li>After seeing my boys, several family and friends have asked me to cut their hair, too, so I can only figure I am doing a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>Cuts really well</li>
      <li>A Classic 76 user for fifteen years, I had been using a size 2 blade on both my beard and scalp.</li>
      <li>Bought an Oster 76 Classic clipper, along with a #1.5 and #2 blade for haircut purposes.  </li>
      <li>SHAME THAT ITS PRICED SO HIGH ALL OVER</li>
      <li>High quality blade.</li>
      <li>I just purchesed some clippers and I had to buy the guards, the reason I gave it a 4 star is because the blades could&#x27;ve been a little bit more sharper</li>
      <li>Clippers work like new</li>
      <li>The blades are professional quality, exactly what my barber uses, and will last years.  </li>
      <li>I attribute this less to my skills and more to the fact that the Oster 76 and these blades work terrific.  </li>
      <li>The blade was clearly used and repackaged.</li>
      <li>Not the professional quality you expect from Oster.</li>
      <li>This was a pretty big initial money layout, but has saved me several hundred dollars thus far on haircuts for my three young boys.  </li>
      <li>and I am very surprised that a reputable company like Amazon would allow this extensive false advertising to continue!</li>

<li> The blade is ruff across the skin plus like the other reviews the picture is different from the product.  </li>
<li> /&gt;My previous, cheap-o beard trimmer left my beard whiskers sharp.</li>

<li> (where I would practice doing fades then just buzz down my hack job one clipper size for an even cut)</li>
<li> You advertise on probably half of all of your Oster blades as having the Agion coating, when you know that they don&#x27;t.</li>
<li> What I am most unhappy about is Amazon allowing false advertising of the products they sell on their web site (this in spite of the fact that you have been notified a number of times in the reviews on your web site that the products received were not as they were described).</li>
<li> I decided to start trimming my beard a little shorter.</li>
<li> You will shell out a few dollars to get the two or three blades you need.</li>
<li> Even then, move slowly.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s 1 1/2, I was confused when I opened it</li>
<li> In spite of that fact, you are falsely advertising that the blades you are selling do have the Agion coating</li>
<li> You are advertising that your Oster blades have a Agion coating, which is false.</li>
<li> Product description needs to be updated to reflect what&#x27;s actually being sold - very disappointed.</li>
<li> Just as if the barber was cutting your hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Clipper blades stick and get caught in hair even after lubrication.  Be prepared to take it all apart to clean and lubricate if you want them to work.  Even then, move slowly.  Not the professional quality you expect from Oster.</li>
    <li> The blade is ruff across the skin plus like the other reviews the picture is different from the product.  The blade does not say AgION Collection nor does the package.</li>
    <li> The blade was clearly used and repackaged. Once I opened it up, there was hair all over the blade, returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> My husband has been looking for these for a while and loves them both for the price and the quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect length for my purppose.  High quality blade.</li>
    <li> As described and on time</li>
    <li> Perfect for the Oster 76 clippers, its a must have if you are a Barber. I am very satisfied with the quality of this blade.</li>
    <li> This cuts way better than the plastic ones I used on my Wahl. I have an Oster now and cut my hair myself. It looks as good as the barber cut.</li>
    <li> Clippers work like new</li>
    <li> Great clipper blade. can always depend on the Oster product line</li>
    <li> I just purchesed some clippers and I had to buy the guards, the reason I gave it a 4 star is because the blades could&#x27;ve been a little bit more sharper</li>
    <li> Matches my head size and work perfectly with the Oster Machine. I recommend it to whoever need on but it cut closed to skin</li>
    <li> THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR... MY SON LIKES IT BETTER THEN THE OLDER ONE WE HAD ...COMES NICELY PACKED IN THIS BOX ...SHAME THAT ITS PRICED SO HIGH ALL OVER</li>
    <li> easy to use and attach. easy to clean also. Cuts really well but can get pretty warm, very good build.</li>
    <li> Great cliperps that consistently do the job. I&#x27;m glad I got them online instead of art a beauty style store.</li>
    <li> The blade is not 1A it&#x27;s 1 1/2, I was confused when I opened it but once I read the description I realized the picture is incorrect. Great blade though!</li>
    <li> Bought an Oster 76 Classic clipper, along with a #1.5 and #2 blade for haircut purposes.  This was a pretty big initial money layout, but has saved me several hundred dollars thus far on haircuts for my three young boys.  I have no formal barber training and after several rounds of practice (where I would practice doing fades then just buzz down my hack job one clipper size for an even cut), I got quite good at the fade and can now give barber shop quality haircuts to my three boys.  I attribute this less to my skills and more to the fact that the Oster 76 and these blades work terrific.  They are very durable, they cut precise and what you see in the picture is what you get delivered.  The blades are professional quality, exactly what my barber uses, and will last years.  At $15+tip/haircut x 3 boys x 12 months &#x3D; $720/year, this system has more than paid for itself.  Plus, it is kind of fun giving haircuts.  After seeing my boys, several family and friends have asked me to cut their hair, too, so I can only figure I am doing a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> Even cut every time. Easy to use and replace makes clean up fat and easy. I&#x27;d recommend buying these and more</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Love it!! Came fast, fits right, Cuts hubby and our boys hair well. So happy we went with this clipper!!</li>
    <li> these were Christmas Gifts and the recipient is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Pulls while it cuts sometimes</li>
    <li> Sharp and durable.  Great link between a 1 and a 2.  Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I trim my beard once a week or so with this blade and I often get compliments on how neat and tidy it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous, cheap-o beard trimmer left my beard whiskers sharp. The cheap-o trimmer also didn&#x27;t fully cut sometimes so it left little beard daggers to be caught in my fingertips (or others&#x27;!) as splinters. Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer makes nice clean flat cuts so the beard feels much smoother and doesn&#x27;t break off at the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luxuriate in your awesome beard...</li>
    <li> Did not receive what was advertised.  Product description needs to be updated to reflect what&#x27;s actually being sold - very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just the blade I needed to produce the hair length I desire.</li>
    <li> A Classic 76 user for fifteen years, I had been using a size 2 blade on both my beard and scalp. I decided to start trimming my beard a little shorter. Though I also had a size 1 blade for edge areas, this was too short, so I purchased the size 1.5 blade. The length is exactly what I wanted. I was also pleased to find the build quality in this blade no different from the build quality of the blades I purchased fifteen years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: If you&#x27;re still using clippers with plastic guards to adjust the length of your trim, do yourself a favor and switch to clipper blades that are pre-set. You will shell out a few dollars to get the two or three blades you need. But you will never again have the guard slip off your clipper and have to walk around the next week with a noticeable notch in your beard.</li>
    <li> this is a great product cuts hair very smooth and clean great for all levels of expertise of use .</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD QUALITY BLADES</li>
    <li> Oster blades are the best!</li>
    <li> Works well with oster cutters. If you shave your head a lot I would recommend this product. It is good.</li>
    <li> Just as if the barber was cutting your hair.</li>
    <li> I will preface my statement by saying I love my Oster clippers and blades. What I am most unhappy about is Amazon allowing false advertising of the products they sell on their web site (this in spite of the fact that you have been notified a number of times in the reviews on your web site that the products received were not as they were described). You are advertising that your Oster blades have a Agion coating, which is false. None of the blades I was sent have this coating (I brought 8 blades) and I found out after receiving the non Agion blades that Oster no longer uses this coating on their blades for about a year now. In spite of that fact, you are falsely advertising that the blades you are selling do have the Agion coating and I am very surprised that a reputable company like Amazon would allow this extensive false advertising to continue! You advertise on probably half of all of your Oster blades as having the Agion coating, when you know that they don&#x27;t. Shame on you Amazon!</li>
    <li> A wonderful tool for the professional barber</li>
    <li> for the price of one haircut, I was able to cut my hair for over two years :)  love it</li>
    <li> the blade did what it was suppose to do.</li>
