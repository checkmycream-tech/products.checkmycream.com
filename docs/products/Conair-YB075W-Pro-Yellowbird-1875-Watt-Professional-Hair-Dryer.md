<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I did not buy this hair dryer off amazon but I would recommend everybody that is looking for a good hair dryer to buy this one. I brought this hair dryer about three years ago after my friend let me use her&#x27;s. The things that stood out most to me was that the comb stayed on because my old hair dryer comb kept coming off when it got to heat. I can go months without get a relaxer and this blow dryer will make my hair so smooth and straight that when I straighten my hair it looks like I just got my hair done professional.It&#x27;s easy to use it has a high and low setting and a hot and cold setting. I love this dryer and mines came with a one year warranty from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store. The price is great on here because I paid fifty dollars for mine.</li>
    <li> Loved this hair dryer the first few months I used it until it started cutting off in the middle of drying my hair! My last hair dryer lasted YEARS but this one only lasted about 4 months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the yellowbird- it rules. Works great, dries your hair fast and fits all add ons (diffusers, etc). The nozzle is long, so you can get to the roots on longer hair without getting your hair tangled in the vent (happens a lot on other dryers). Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s the cutest cheeriest bright yellow ever. We had this same dryer in white when I was growing up, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I like this very much. IT&#x27;s much more yellow than in the picture, but that is alright. It is very much a professional dryer. The add on&#x27;s that come with it are of good quality. It is powerful and complets drying my hair in about 5 minutes. The warnings that come in the package are kind of scary read them but don&#x27;t let them discourage you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife with her long,thick hair because she always complained about how her rotary style hair dryer wasn&#x27;t powerful enough. I was at my barbershop and noticed this was the model my barber used and it blew strong hot air so I decided to get her one and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like the Yellow Bird dryer. Its durable, easy to use and it dries my hair very fast. It also comes with attachments that makes the process even easier. I have African American hair and this is just perfect for it.</li>
    <li> This dryer gets the job done: just want it dry?  It&#x27;s fast and powerful and you can easily direct it.  It also comes with two attachments, one for straightening, the other for zeroing down on problem areas.  I love the color too - it&#x27;s bright and cheery.</li>
    <li> I have natural, color-treated, kinky- curly, african american hair. A co-worker recommended it for blow outs.(She&#x27;s used it for 3 years twice a week, with no replacements). I&#x27;ve had the yellow bird for 4 months, and i have NO complaints. It has reduced my drying time in half, i LOVE the four different heat settings (cold setting at the end for shine), and (most importantly) the comb is nice and strong! I purchased it at a beauty supply store but i just HAD to come on here and sing this bird&#x27;s praises! I AM SUCH A FAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/23/10-----I STILLL LOOOOOOOVE THE YELLOW BIRD! i use it once a week for my hair and it&#x27;s still going strong. No problems whatsoever! i&#x27;ve recommended this dryer to about 5 others, they&#x27;ve all bought it and they LOVE it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5/13 -----My YellowBird is still going strong. I use it less on my hair (1-2 times a month), but it&#x27;s still effective. The ONLY complaint is that I can&#x27;t order a replacement comb - I dropped the whole unit by mistake and 2 teeth came off on one end. I STILL use the comb, I just divide my hair in smaller sections so that my hair doesn&#x27;t pass through the end with the broken teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal dryer.  I use it at home, and this dryer truly saves me time each morning.  The air flow and temperature are really professional quality.  I&#x27;m glad that I have a new Conair dryer to replace the old ones that I&#x27;ve had for more than 15 years.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair so i&#x27;ve tried many hair dryers. This one worked okay. I don&#x27;t think it was anything amazing. Then after 6 months it stopped being able to blow out hot air, only cold. it lasted less time than any other dryer ive had. and i&#x27;ve had many conairs. i suppose this dryer is ok for people who don&#x27;t use one much.</li>
    <li> The hair drier is as it was described, the price was really good and my daughter and her long hair are very pleased with the drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The United States Parcel Post took 22 days to deliver it.  It would be worth spending an extra bit of change to get a faster delivery.</li>
    <li> I have had this particular hairdryer for five years; the longest lasting hairdryer i have owned to date. It is fabulous! Easy controls, with no odd button to hold down for \\&quot;cool\\&quot; air, great air pressure, and it is a fun color. Only down side is that is does not come with a diffuser, and i never really could find one that fit. Other than that, it is a great product and i am sad that mine recently died. 5 years, it was a good run. RIP</li>
    <li> I have had a yellow bird blow dryer since 1976. I replaced mine 7/2011 (35 years).  So you can see this powerful, durable, and efficient dryer is worth it&#x27;s money and more.  I think I spent $15.00 on it back in &#x27;76 and that averages out to be $.43 cents per year for my investment.  No wonder it is hard (or non-existent) to find in beauty stores, online, and on Conair&#x27;s website (it is not available on their website).    I love all of the settings from cold to very hot.  It comes with a comb (I don&#x27;t use it anymore since I have dreadlocks) and a muzzle that narrows at the tip.      I would also recommend this model to any beauty salon because it holds up.</li>
    <li> I bought my old Conair-- a very similar style-- in the late 70s and used it for nearly 30 years. Astonishing.   I replaced the cord, which had a crack near the plug, in the early 90s.  Thought about doing it again when the \\&quot;new\\&quot; 20 year old cord cracked, but in our throw-away culture, it&#x27;s now much more expensive to fix.  I like this new one very much, mainly because it&#x27;s very much like my old one, though this has a sturdier &amp; safer plug with a fuse &amp; reset button, a great idea.  Frankly, the cold air setting doesn&#x27;t blow quite as hard as my old one, but the feature is hard to find, and this one still gets the job done. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased and I&#x27;d recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> After three different purchases that failed the heat test, the fourth purchase of this yellowbird finally proves a keeper. I like the different heat settings and most importantly it gets hot enough to make a difference.  Other benefits:  it has a long cord so I don&#x27;t have to stand right next to the outlet. Easy to hold, solid weight, not too loud. No more shopping around, should have looked on line in the first place.</li>
    <li> The Yellowbird 1875 watt hairdryer is a throwback to the old-style Conair dryers of the 70&#x27;s &amp; 80&#x27;s.  If it has the same reliability &amp; stamina as the older models, it will be a winner.  So far  it delivers power, is simple to operate and does what a hairdryer needs to do - dry your hair.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the BEST dryer I have ever owned! this is the only dryer I have ever used that allows me to finish my whole head without it stopping, my other dryers stop at LEAST twice to cool down before I finish! the comb attachment had me sort of skeptical because my hair is coarse and kinky but this comb attachment works like a DREAM it literally glides through my hair better than ANY other comb attachment of any dryer I have ever used, I get so angry just thinking about the fact that this dryer has been around for years and I had no Idea! This type of hair dryer is exactly what my hair needed  and I just found out about it! I will never purchase another hair dryer other than this one again!</li>
    <li> My Yellowbird has finally passed, after about 5 years of blowing out the hair of my family and friends. I am an African American female, and this blowdryer has straightened out some of the toughest hair imaginable! I braid the hair of my family and friends, and this dryer has been well-used on a weekly basis since I took it out of the package. I used it up until it died on me today!!! I am soooo glad that Amazon sells it, b/c I am about to purchase a new one right now!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer less than 6 months ago. I use it every other day at most.  This morning I woke up, showered, started to blow dry my hair and discovered that the heating element had gone out and all I can get now is cold air.  Considering that I paid $40 for this dryer at my local Sally Beauty Supply I was mad because I have had way cheaper ones that lasted way longer.</li>
    <li> This is my third \\&quot;bird\\&quot;.  I buy it for the intense heat and the pic.  My  long, thick hair comes out straight and soft. I can do what they do in the salon with this dryer as it is easy to handle. Making just the pic available would be a bonus from the manufacturer as the teeth do break after all the heat. Substitute pics cannot take the heat and therefore do not work.</li>
    <li> I have used this hairdryer for the last 20 years.They last a very long time and is very comfortable to use and I love the color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because quite a few of the Youtube vloggers I follow use/recommended it. I liked that it dried my hair well and that it had 4 different settings from cool to hot, but I found that if you hold it by the nozzle end like I do, it heats up ALOT! I used it primarily on the warm setting applying the tension method to my (4b/4c) hair and it was fine. I accidentally had it on the hot setting initially and that was too much heat for my hair. There&#x27;s not much that&#x27;s special about this dryer, but overall, it&#x27;s a powerful, not too pricey option if you are looking for a professional style hairdryer.</li>
    <li> This blow dry is awesome!!! It dries my hair so quickly! I have used blowdryers, but this one beats them by a long shot. I like that it is heavy duty and built to last. Looking forward to having this for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great blowdryer, have been buying it for years! They die for me after about a year or so, so I have them replaced under manuf warranty which is so quick!  I can&#x27;t seem to get away from this dryer, love it!</li>
    <li> Once trusty Conair has disappointed me twice in two years. One dryer lasted a year and half before it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. The Yellowbird lasted just about two months --blows only cold air now.  I didn&#x27;t get a response when I tried to contact customer service. I&#x27;m going to buy a pro dryer, which this, most certainly, is not.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this hair dryer and I am so happy that I did!  High quality dryer with a 2-year guarantee.  I love the fact that it actually blows COLD air when I dry my hair in the summer in addition to all of the other nice features.  This is a feature that I haven&#x27;t found on any other dryer, some have a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; button but they never actually blow cold air, they just turn off the heat element.  This dryer also has a reinforced steel hang ring, a long cord and GFCI protected.  The only thing that I do not like is the yellow color (see picture)- it doesn&#x27;t really go with many bathroom colors and we hang our hair dryers up.  However, I would never lower the quality rating of a product just because of the color.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great.  I&#x27;ve bought myself and a family member one as well.  Both of us are pleased with the drying time as we both have thick hair.  I recommend this product for people who are really looking for a powerful hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is a great product.  It is lightweight and dries your hair fast.  It is a super product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used Conair products for years.  My \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; hairdryer died after years of daily use.  It was discontinued so I looked for something with the same power and found the Yellow Bird.  It worked great for less than a year and all of a sudden I smelled that electrical burning smell and it would NOT turn off.  I had to unplug it.  The power switch is stuck and when I plugged it back in after it had cooled, nothing.  I have really thick medium length hair and need something with power.  I&#x27;m hesitant to order another and VERY disappointed that this is their professional model.</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about this hairdryer, in fact I&#x27;d go so far as to say that it appears to be very well made and the color is cool but.........does anyone know where you can buy a hairdryer these days that doesn&#x27;t use CERAMIC AND ION???!!!  I understand what they are and I hate what they do to my hair!!!  I know the Conair Blackbird toutes that it doesn&#x27;t use either so I guess I&#x27;ll have to try that, but I&#x27;ve had no luck finding another choice.</li>
    <li> I first saw this product at my hairdresser&#x27;s salon while she was blowing drying my daughter&#x27;s hair.  This product was wonderful. It made her hair soft and light and dried her hair within minutes.  It also straightens the hair which my daughter loves as her hair is natural.  I also tried it on my relaxed hair and it did the same thing.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is the best standard blow dryer on the market.Plenty of power and heat.Nothing else compares.This will keep that 80&#x27;s hair blown back for shure.This was made for Bon Jovi &amp; Rod Stewart types.</li>
    <li> I never want heat.&lt;br /&gt;I just want cool air blowing hard.&lt;br /&gt;But this dryer will not blow cool air on high speed.&lt;br /&gt;It blows cool air softly just fine.&lt;br /&gt;But, if you turn up the speed, then you get hot air.&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, this dryer gets 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;But, for the other people in my house who want hot air, it gets 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;So, I am settling on 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was purchased for my daughter in law. She said it cuts hair drying time down in half and her hair has so much volume after using it. I see where others say it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Her old one was this same brand and lasted over a year. And our opinion is that even if you have to replace it after a year, its worth the cost and time to do so! :)</li>
    <li> high watts, nice attachments and when i purchased it was a little higher, but still worth the price.  i still use it to this day, the cheery brightens the day too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this blow dryer for years. Mine finally broke so I ordered another and it is fantastic. I have really thick hair and it works faster than any blow dryer I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how heavy and unwieldy this cheery yellow bird is.  I&#x27;ve been spoiled by lighter dryers and find my arms feeling weary and unwilling to spend time styling.  Not Conair&#x27;s fault, it was my bad for thinking it would be lighter than it looks.  It&#x27;s getting shoved to the back of a junk drawer.  Rats.</li>
    <li> Broke after 6 months. One day it just stopped blowing hot air. Cold air works fine. It was great while it lasted.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very best hair dryers on the market . I know several hair dressers that use it.</li>
    <li> I really really like this product. It does a great dryer my hair (I definitely get a salon quality finish with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is the second Yellowbird I&#x27;ve bought in 2 years. Both of these stopped generating hot air within 9-10 months. Just blows cold air. It&#x27;s the oddest thing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer a little over a year ago, and have used it almost daily to dry my hair after showering.  I was very happy with the dryer, as it was powerful and offered a reasonable selection of temperatures.  I exercised proper care for the dryer and never abused it.  However, Friday morning I turned the dryer on, and since it is getting cold, I decided to use high heat instead of medium heat like I almost always choose.  After just a few moments there came a hot, nasty smelling smoke jetting out from behind the power switch.  I unplugged the dryer and have not plugged it back in since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Target to find a replacement, and was disappointed.  None of them performed as well as this one.  But I&#x27;m afraid to buy another.  What has the world come to when you can&#x27;t even buy a decent hair dryer for less than $75 unless you&#x27;re willing to accept this kind of crappy workmanship?  I guess the solution is to buy them in quantity and treat them as disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it didn&#x27;t perform so well (when it wasn&#x27;t producing smoke and fire) then I&#x27;d give it the minimum score... but since it really does work nice, I&#x27;ll give it two stars.  Buy more than one, and don&#x27;t let them run unattended.</li>
    <li> This is my third Yellow Bird.  I keep one as a spare just in case -- air flow and heat are superior to any product (including the Conair family) that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve bought them for both daughters, who will also continue to use them as long as they are produced.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer just because it was my favorite color. It turns out that it also is a wonderful dryer. I love it. Lots of power and quiet. /Quiet enough to use on my puppy who no longer is frightened of being dried after his bath.</li>
    <li> ordered the yellowbird on the recommendation of my hair dresser. Was quite surprised when it stopped working. Only blows cold air.</li>
    <li> Good power.  Easy to handle.  Settings don&#x27;t get in the way of the handle.  This is the third one I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> It actually drys a person&#x27;s hair and does it well.  It probably has other uses such as drying dogs or shrink-wrapping window film but I do not know about them.  It drys hair well.  The controls are easy to see and that&#x27;s important for the visually impaired.  The controls are logical.  Moreover, there is sufficient ranges for each.  It is not terribly expensive but it is plastic and not a heavyweight stainless steel machine.  It is just a pretty doggone good hairdryer.</li>
    <li> We were very excited to find the Yellowbird. We&#x27;ve been buying the lower-priced Conairs for years, and they did a great job. The model we&#x27;d buy, just from the local supermarket, looks exactly like the Yellowbird but they&#x27;re blue in color and not nearly as solidly constructed as the Yellowbird. Our only complaint was that, even with regular cleaning of the lint filter, they only seemed to last a year or so. When we saw the reviews of the Yellowbird with at least one reviewer having theirs for five years, we were anxious to buy. I ordered one from Amazon and we picked up another one for a few dollars more at a local beauty supply store.    The Yellowbird is impressively constructed. It&#x27;s solid, a little heavier than normal but not too heavy to hold for long periods of time. Although still the same 1875 watts we had been using, the air flow is more powerful than the lower-end models. The Yellowbird has a high-gauge power cord with a built-in ground fault interrupt plug for safety.    I was looking forward writing a 5-star review on this hair dryer when one of the units, the one we bought at the local supply shop, stop generating heat after about a month. We shipped it back to Conair at our expense and they replaced the unit. Since this was the over-the-counter unit I thought perhaps this one had been damaged in the same way at the store, and didn&#x27;t think much of it. Recently, however, the unit purchased from Amazon and in-use for about 60 days, had the same problem. We&#x27;ll return this as well.    Shipping costs back to Conair ran about $7.00 each, plus Conair wants a check for their costs to ship a replacement to you. We told them in writing that we would not pay this, and they shipped the replacements anyway. However, you may want to consider buying at a brick &amp; mortar with a liberal carry-in replacement policy, just in case.    I&#x27;m keeping my rating middle-of-the-road even with the quality problems on the units themselves. When they work, they&#x27;re great, and hopefullywhat happened to us was an anomaly and not a large-scale quality problem.    Update Feb 2011: About 24 months after replacement, the unit that gets used twice a day is still going strong! One caution is that the dryer generates an incredible amount of heat. You need to keep it moving to avoid damaging your hair!    Update May 2011: Two years and three months, no heat from the dryer. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Sent this to my daughter in college. Thought it would bring a smile while blow drying. She reports being very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Wow, finally a dryer that blows cool air. I tried a lot of dryers that claim to blow cold air but they all really blow warm air. This one really blows cool air. If you are looking a cool air dryer this is it. Stay away from thedryers that have the cold shot feature as it will blow warm air.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m as devoted to the Yellowbird as a person can be to her hair dryer. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the device&#x27;s durability; my first one lasted at least five years, and Number 2 (purchased at least five years ago) works as well as it did on day one. As long as I keep the vents clear of lint and other debris, it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me the dryer&#x27;s real selling point is its simple and responsive temperature settings. With thin, baby-fine hair, I use warm air to dry and style, followed by cool air to set the style and take the heat off the hair. Unlike other dryers that have a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button (which you have to uncomfortably press and hold down for as long as you need cooler air), switching the Yellowbird&#x27;s temperature toggle actually gives you a constant flow of honest-to-goodness \\&quot;cool\\&quot; -- not just \\&quot;less hot\\&quot; -- air as long as you need it. Flipping the toggle back quickly warms the air flow so you can continue drying and styling the next section. I&#x27;m convinced this design has saved me not only from horrible split ends but also from the thumb cramps that those stupid \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; buttons encourage. As such, I say, \\&quot;Thank you, Yellowbird. You will always have a place near my bathroom mirror.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, packaged well - and works great!  Perfect heat (doesn&#x27;t fry your hair), nice attachments for directing heat to specific areas (I have very, very thick hair), great cord length, and perfect weight. This is a very simple, easy to use, and effective hair dryer at a nice price. I love it!</li>
    <li> This was the first product I buy on amazon, the thing is heavy but it works amazing , is big but I won&#x27;t change it for nothing!! The prize it&#x27;s awesome comparing with what you can do with this thing, best thing it won&#x27;t damage ur hair !</li>
    <li> For drying hair it does work very well and does not give off ozone, which is good if you have asthma or other respiratory sensitivities. Believe it or not, but another ionizing hair dryer caused my eyes to water and wheezing. I could barely sleep until my girlfriend happened across some information that said the ionizing hair dryers can cause this. When she purchased this hair dryer my asthma problems stopped. Unfortunately, I have to knock several stars off this product because the on/off switch has already failed, which was pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> one of the best things i bought here on amazon, love love love my yellow bird. the only thing i dont like is that its a bit heavy besides that it works well and quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these since 1976 when my last one flew off the top of my car while driving down the street and broke into a thousand pieces (I forgot I left it on top of my car), but I thought they were no longer making them.  Lo and behold, I was at a hair salon in New Orleans, and the hairdresser whipped out one of these babies.  I exclaimed how much I missed mine from the 70&#x27;s, and she informed me &amp;#34;honey, they&#x27;re still makin these puppies.&amp;#34;  So I am now reunited w/ my beloved yellowbird.</li>
    <li> I expect to get more than 15 months out of a hairdryer, especially since I travelled for work about 30% of the time and didn&#x27;t bring this hairdryer with me.  This hairdryer replaced the Blackbird, which lasted over 3 years.  I liked that this dryer was powerful and hot.  It dried my hair quickly, and I had no problems blowing my very wavy hair out straight.  I&#x27;d love to get another one, but am trying a BaByliss this time in the hopes that it will last longer.</li>
    <li> This is a great, great blow dryer. It straightens my hair better than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve owned. I love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick hair and burns out my blow dryers....the comb is sterdy, the heat is just the right amount of hot and its very durable.</li>
    <li> This is a very great hairdryer.  Both my mom and my daughter got one they love it. Doesn&#x27;t loose power takes a while to get warm in your hands. Great value.</li>
    <li> I had to include my ethnic background in this review because there is a total difference in the type of products needed when it comes to styling natural Black hair versus other hair types. My hair is afro textured very dense and I have a lot of hair to dry. I find it hard to find a good blow dryer for my hair. So far this blow dryer gets the job done. I really like it. It gets hot enough to straighten my hair without leaving it totally brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this blow dryer to anybody with hair that is very thick and hard to dry, I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t like how the switches are on the handle. It can make it hard to use for long periods of time. Otherwise it is a good so far.</li>
    <li> Great while it lasted. Only lasted 1 month then the heating element went out. Very disappointed. Now it only blows cold air.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer but after 6 months it stop blowing hot air! I did buy a new yellow bird but this time I got the warranty!</li>
    <li> I am natural with thick thick African American hair.  My hair goal is to get to waist length and don&#x27;t like flat ironing my hair.  The last time I went to a salon, I came out smelling my hair like it was burned.  So I started looking for a blowdryer that will make my hair straight but not flat ironed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did research and decided to try this.  God... I loveeeeeeeeeeeeee it.  I just finished blowdrying my hair and it looks just the way I wanted it.  Not too straight with some volume to it.  Ughhh.. Why didn&#x27;t I buy this a log time ago?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE TO SELF: AFTER DOING RESEARCH, READ REVIEWS, QUICKLY BUY PRODUCT..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this if you want to... you won&#x27;t be disappointed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XoXo</li>
    <li> I loved this hairdryer while it lasted, it had a lot of power, was not terribly loud, and dried my long hair quickly. However, with no warning one recent day it just stopped blowing hot air. Only cold air blows out of the unit now.</li>
    <li> The product Worked well&lt;br /&gt;I Would recommend&lt;br /&gt;I Would buy again&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time as stated online&lt;br /&gt;Very Cost effective</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it.  The hair dryer with attachment works great and dries my hair fast.  Buying one for my sister</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s solidly constructed but I&#x27;m on my second one in 2 years and this one only last 3 months. Sally Beauty supply is not taking it back, they only have a 60 day in store return policy. But the point is this hair dryer should last longer. First one lasted 18 months, 2nd one last 3 months. Time to find another dryer. I&#x27;ll probably send it in for replacement, but I still have to buy another hair dryer while I&#x27;m waiting. Very frustrated with the poor quality of things being built these days.    Update: Sally Beauty supply did let me return this model and I upgraded to a new ionic one (Helen of troy, pink one)... don&#x27;t know if it will last longer, hope so, but wanted to set it straight that Sally beauty was very decent about this. Great customer service once I talked to the manager.</li>
    <li> A professional hair dryer makes al the difference!  This dryer has multiple settings, both heat, cool, various air volume speeds so you can taylor the drying for so many different styles and hair styles.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> This dryer is literally the best hair dryer i have ever used. I watched youtube videos on the product before i purchased it and no one had anything bad to say about the item. I would highly recommend that anyone use this dryer you will find that it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product and I especially like the type of flip activated switches!</li>
    <li> Ive had this blow dryer before and lasted me about 8 years and then the engine blew and i bought another one. Great product and gets HOT!!!</li>
    <li> It is colorful, strudy with a nice, long, strudy cord, and quality attachments. However, the box states 4 Speed/Heat Settings. I was anticipating a warm setting, but there is only a hot setting and a cool setting. I really wanted a \\&quot;Warm\\&quot; setting. If I had to do it all over, I would make sure the product stated that it had a warm setting.</li>
    <li> With long, thick hair, it&#x27;s a pain in the neck to wash and dry it. this yellowbird makes it easier to dry my hair without taking all day.</li>
    <li> I searched all over town for a hair dryer like this one before checking Amazon.  I had one of those universal combs and none of dryers would fit it and it is so hard to find dryers with comb attachments that won&#x27;t break in my thick hair.  This dryer not only fits the universal comb, but it comes with its own comb which works just as well.  It gets pretty hot, so it doesn&#x27;t take that long to dry my hair.  I would definitely recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen it used in a few hair salons and I&#x27;m glad I tried it. I can adjust the setting perfectly for my hair. Not too hot but enough heat to straighten my natural hair with no chemical assistance.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer its easy to blow out my hair. Sturdy,durable comb. I would highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sooo glad I bought this blow dryer, it gets my African American hair really straight and makes flat ironing 10 times easier! The comb attachment is the best part, next to the hot and cool switches you can flip to the position you want without having to hold them down. Buy this blow dryer and you won&#x27;t want another one.</li>
    <li> This is not the best hair dryer out there. I know you could get better ones for the same price that will dry your hair very quickly, but I mainly bought it for the way it looks. I love the retro style and it goes well with my taste. It&#x27;s an all right product, and I don&#x27;t have such unmanageable hair to need anything more high-tech. It fits my purposes just fine.</li>
    <li> Up to now I have not received this product. One attempt was made to deliver the product and no more.Now the product that I really need is apparently on its way back to the seller according to fedex. I&#x27;m very very disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> I only blow dry my hair straight about once a week.  Although I liked the blowdryer, I&#x27;ve had blowdryers last years.  I went through 2 in 2 years.  So:  Not so good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Yellowbird hairs dryers for YEARS. My last one lastest over 10 years. I think if I didn&#x27;t CONSTANTLY drop it it would have lasted longer. Its a very sturdy and strong hair dryer but I am very abusive with my stuff :)</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I have ever, every had, at my age I have had several!&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser said this is one of the closest to &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; hair dryers,&lt;br /&gt;and it is the truth!  Great, great heat and quick drying.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer shaved 1-1/2 hours off my hair straightening time.  I have curly (or better yet \\&quot;coily\\&quot;) hair and this hair dryer (with the comb attachment) goes through it like butter! I highly recommend this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer for a friend of mine.  She loves it.  The concentrator nozzle makes during quicker and the straightener attachment is excellent for getting straighter hair.  She has pretty thick hair and it works excellently.  The 4 different settings are the best feature in my mind.</li>
    <li> Bought this One year ago to the day (in 2011).&lt;br /&gt;It is DEAD... Blowing cold air at me. Took it apart..no fix.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a replacement here (in June 2012), it lasted exactly 11 months, DEAD as well.&lt;br /&gt;Am now buying a THIRD unit.&lt;br /&gt;(and this has all been normal once a day use, by ONE person).&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we should all change automobiles once a year too.</li>
    <li> I dont understand the great reviews of others.  This hairdryer is less than average to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;It does not get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;does not have a strong blast.&lt;br /&gt;Slow to dry my hair&lt;br /&gt;Sucks my hair into the vent on the side and my hair gets stuck in the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;feels heavy and substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the REALLY annoying thing is that it sucks my long hair into the vent on the side of the dryer and my hair gets stuck in the motor!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have to cut my hair out with scissors.  Yeah, OUCH.&lt;br /&gt;Who puts the vent on the side, anyway????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dealbreaker.  This machine is going back to the store.</li>
    <li> Everyone should own this hair dryer.  Throws out a lot of heat, works very well with Afro-American hair. The comb is very strudy. Only complaint it is somewhat heavier than what I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Yellowbird in September.  I only used it two or three times a week, and by January it was broken.  The heating element died and now it only blows cold air. I should have kept the cheap hair dryer I&#x27;ve had since high school.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this hair dryer as I loved the first one so much.  It gets hot enough to straighten as it dries.  Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I was a hair cutter for ten years back in the 80&#x27;s.  Nothing has ever beaten the Yellowbird as far as power and design.</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer, ever! Always leaves my hair straight with lots of body. I&#x27;ve had my first one for at least 7 years. I was trying to share it with my sister &amp; her daughter. Now, I&#x27;m having my own daughter soon, so I gave my sister the first one &amp; I bought another one.</li>
    <li> Its good but its heavy and it will tired you out really fast so be quick and efficient. Also it gets kinda hot too so you wanna be double quick! Or just stop, and wait a few if you&#x27;re heat conscious like me.</li>
    <li> Have been using the yellow bird dryer for a least 20 years.  It&#x27;s the best blow dryer on the market bt conair</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and I&#x27;ve tried many other blow dryer but the result is not d same as d conair yellow bird...I love this product and will recommend it 2 others</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it takes about 20 minutes to dry it.  This dryer kept overheating on me.  I ended up buying the Conair BB075W Pro Blackbird 2000-Watt Hair Dryer, which works just fine.  The Yellowbird should probably only be used by people with fine hair who don&#x27;t need the dryer to be on for any length of time.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware.  The classic yellow bird dryer has been \\&quot;redesigned\\&quot;.  The dryer is lighter in weight (which professional hair stylists probably appreciate), but the air current flowing out of the dryer is considerably weaker than on the older model.  What a disappointment.  I had to return mine because the quality was so bad (after having used yellow bird dryers for many years).</li>
    <li> After the attachment on my last blowdryer broke a friend recommended this one. I have been very happy with it! No issues with the attachments and it gets super hot!</li>
    <li> Blow dryer burned out after a few uses, tried to exchange it but too late, waste of money do not buy.</li>
    <li> ONE STAR IS TOO HIGH......while I&#x27;ve used Yellow Bird Hair Dryers for years and have always loved them, their high quality has totally deteriorated.  The last two hair dryers have worked less than 2 months.  The first time it happened, I decided to give them a 2nd chance.  Now, this hair dryers has quit heating after only one month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning the item is expensive and time consuming......I&#x27;ll just have to find another company and hair dryer.  Surely, there are others that will work for longer than 1-2 months.</li>
    <li> Been using this dryer for the past 6 months and it&#x27;s works great. The hot setting is not &amp;#34;burn your scalp hot&amp;#34; but warm enough to dry your hair rapidly. Great for styling hair also.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. I am an African American with curly kinky natural hair. And with the help of the pick attachment this blow dryer works more than well for me</li>
    <li> Just get it! O_O that&#x27;s how good it is.... no words can explain how well this thing works. I love mine! Had my eyes on it for years now and now that I have it.....I&#x27;m very pleased and glad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have had many of these in the past and keep purchasing the same one when I need another hair dryer.  Great product, great price on Amazon too!</li>
    <li> I have gone through too many of these dryers. It is my favorite in terms of how great it blows hair straight. But they break too easily and for that price, I had to go with something that i don&#x27;t like as much but that lasts. Mine burnt out within 2 months and I could not return it by the time I got back into the country from my travels.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Super Pharmacy Unica on February 26, 2013.  I received this item at the beginning of March 2013.  I have used this hai rdryer probably six or eight times since receiving.  Yesterday I had to dry my hair ao I turned the dryer on and smoke began to pour out of the on, off switch.  I immediately turned it off .  I sent an email to the seller and I have not received a reply.  I have used Yellowbird hair dryers which I have purchased from other vendors for many years and I have never had a problem with this brand of hair dryer.  Furthermore, this seller has not replied to any of my emails.  I want my money returned so that I can purchase a new Yellowbird hair dryer from a reputable company.</li>
    <li> May be old style but works like it should!  Finally one that won&#x27;t die every 16 months! I love it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to keep the comb attachment on, but I think that is because my hair is so thick. Other than that, it works. Does what it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this hair dryer. I love the color and how it has a retro look to it, but i don&#x27;t love that a year later it is only blowing out cool air. I am disappointed and I most likely won&#x27;t buy a conair again because this isn&#x27;t the first time this happened. I overlooked it once, but twice is too much.</li>
    <li> I love the Yellowbird! I have very long hair and it holds up to drying my hair, as other dryers wind up overheating before my hair is dry. Not this one. It is powerful, unlike many other dryers, and I love the Cool setting that is continuous instead of being a \\&quot;cool shot.\\&quot;  I would reccomend this dryer for anyone with thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now and it is still working perfectly. Dries my hair quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave it as frizzy when I use it with the included extension. The different heat settings are great too; I like having a cool option instead of just a cool button.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer isn&#x27;t as powerful as I thought it would be. I have cheaper ones from Target that blow more air. I got it for the cool air switch and it does work fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Yellow Bird hair dryer for several years.  All of a sudden, only the cold setting worked.  It was time for a new hair dryer.  I was delighted that the same dryer - almost exact was still available.  The only thing I can think to improve it is to find some way to get all the dust that collects in the holes.  Anyone??</li>
    <li> This is the best $35 investment that I could have possibly made for my hair.  I have thick, coarse, curly-ish with a semblance of a wave hair so blow-drying it can be quite a challenge.  This hair dryer gets my hair very straight in no time.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been natural for six months. I love how this &amp;#34;straightens&amp;#34; our hair in two to three passes w/o applying too much heat to our hair. I love that we can adjust the temp, and how it has a cool setting</li>
    <li> My hair gets caught and yanked if I get the dryer to close to my head. Also, it weighs too much.</li>
    <li> I have a tough time with my hair. I&#x27;m black (just throwing that out there for whoever wants to catch it!) and I have relaxed hair. It&#x27;s not my hair that&#x27;s tough, it&#x27;s basically me; I have a tough time with DOING my own hair, basically I&#x27;m awkward and a weakling and have no talent. I used this for the first time today and I am SO HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;-VERY easy to read. There are 4 settings: cold, warm, hot, and very hot. Those blue and red switches you see determine the heat, all the instructions are on the back of the blowdryer.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not heavy at all! As I said before, I&#x27;m a weakling. I really am, I can barely lift a pen and open a jar. But I can lift this!! True, after holding it for a while It does seem to get a little heavy, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to a lot of other dryers. It&#x27;s very light.&lt;br /&gt;- The size is good. It&#x27;s a MEDIUM dryer. Not too big, not too small. I recommend looking at Youtube videos to get an idea of the size.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a COMB for us black chicks! The comb is really sturdy too.&lt;br /&gt;- Nice design! I love the yellow :3&lt;br /&gt;-Does the job...GOOD! I love the results. It hardly took long at all to do my hair (I didn&#x27;t time it, but it took little to no time. And I have THICK, THICK, TANGLY hair) it dried throughout and left my hair so soft and movey (yes, I made up that word)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a professional dryer for no reason--I&#x27;ve been told to get this dryer countless times, and I&#x27;ve seen it almost as many times in REAL salons. It&#x27;s cheaply priced but really pays for itself. I&#x27;m so incredibly happy with buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store. (In case I didn&#x27;t like it, I could return it easily) It was 40 bucks there, if the deal is cheaper on Amazon, buy it here.  You have nothing to worry about. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This dryer never fails me. It does a great job every time. It gets super hot, which can be dangerous.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! My hair is natural and hard to get straight. This helps me manage my 4a/4c hair type.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer came in 2 days earlier than estimated. The product is exactly as described. It performs perfectly.. good air flow and more tan adequate heat. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase! Thank you!</li>
    <li> If you blow dry your hair a lot, you already own this dryer. If you don&#x27;t use heat much, then you need this blowdryer because it makes your job a lot easier. The only feature I don&#x27;t like is the switch. While blowdrying my hair, the switches will flip up or down, but besides that, the yellowbird dries my hair quickly, is durable, and the color is great!</li>
    <li> this dryer has cut down on some of the time it takes for me to dry my hair.  I used it on my daughters hair as well and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I received this hair dryer on March 23 and it is already broken!  No heat at all.  Not a good deal.</li>
    <li> I love it came in excellent condition.  I absolutely&lt;br /&gt;Love it I have every positive thought about my blow dryer</li>
    <li> The lady who received it, loved it. She had selected it from all the similar products advertized. It continues to serve her well.</li>
    <li> love the yellowbird hair dryer. It does a great job in blowing out my natural hair to the length that I want compared to conair. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Pretty good for people trying to keep their hair natural without adding chemicals. Very quick and has different settings to get hair dried well.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! This hair dryer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I have thick, natural, course hair, and it handles it like a pro! I also love the fact that its yellow for some reason lol. Very satisfied with this dryer :)</li>
    <li> I bought this in April, by the beginning of June the heating element went. I was drying my hair...turned off dryer to bring my daughter to the bus...walked back in -  turned on the dryer and there was no heat. ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This is the best brand available... bar none.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;Great heat when you need it(high/low)&lt;br /&gt;Great air volume( again, high or low)&lt;br /&gt;Comes with attachment for the ladies.</li>
    <li> This is the seocnd one of these I have owned and the first lasted over 10 years.  Gret product, glad I could find it again on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The mutipe temperature settings make it a dream to have.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have had a dublduck blower for over 30 yrs...........looks very similar to this one. Still works; however one day it will stop and I wanted something reasonably priced that will fit the bill............so far this one is. But I rather doubt it will have the longevity my original one has had! WOW</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the power of the hair blower.  My current one is better than this new one.  It delivers less power than expected.</li>
    <li> I love the cooling blow drying feature. I don&#x27;t have to spend hours to get my hair dry. A great buy!</li>
    <li> this is a great product I would recommend it to all my friends that own salon it&#x27;s easy it&#x27;s lightweight and it last</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this hair dryer except for, my wife loves this thing.  Much better then her old piece of junk.. After seeing the joy on her face about this one, i would definitely recommend it for others.</li>
    <li> Conair YB075W Pro Yellowbird is really most excellent. This hair dryer is sturdy and well built. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer after reading a comment from someone else. I was tired of my &amp;#34;Beauty &amp; Supply&amp;#34; store dryers burning out on me and decided to get this one. It was worth the amount I paid for it. When I use it, It takes less time to dry my hair. I section my hair and as quick as it takes me to comb through it with the comb attachment its dry. I can&#x27;t believe how fast this dryer dries my hair. I love it...</li>
