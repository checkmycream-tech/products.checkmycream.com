      <li>/&gt;Photos and more at adventures-in-polishland.com</li>
      <li>This is better than the spray-on version of this tanner because it&#x27;s a lotion and doesn&#x27;t have any overspray to get on everything.</li>
      <li>Being a sun worshiper for many years, I became used to tanned legs during the summer months.  </li>
      <li>As someone with imperfect legs, I LOVE Sally Hansen leg makeup and have been using the spray can version for years.</li>
      <li>I love my legs with Sally on them.</li>
      <li>Thrilled this product now available as cream, in addition to the spray.  </li>
      <li>It does appear to be an orange tone, but as a fair redhead, my skin gets a peachy tone on the rare day I get a tan.  </li>
      <li>In the end this provided a nice, light tan look to my legs.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>But the more I used it the more I blend.</li>
      <li>The spray on version of this tends to cover better, so I&#x27;ll probably just stick to that.</li>
      <li>And its waaay better that the spray</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy it again and Amazon&#x27;s price is the best I could find.</li>
      <li>Hope it works better for you.</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this leg make-up.  </li>
      <li>Probably need the medium for that, but maybe if you applied a lot more than I did.</li>
      <li>Regardless, it looks pretty good on.</li>
      <li>Once in France, I applied it before we went to our &amp;#34;get acquainted dinner&amp;#34; and was pleased with the smooth results.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased with how easy SHAL was to apply and the fine matte finish it gave my legs.</li>
      <li>My legs have a lot of imperfections, which is very noticeable with my fair skin.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quick and as described.</li>
      <li>The lotion is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and I can even moisturize my legs before using.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and lasts well</li>
      <li>It does wash off really easily with soap and water, though.</li>
      <li>I would really like to see a TRUE fair version of this spray.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and have used both the light and medium with natural looking results.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced tremors or anything such as another reviewer has indicated.  </li>
      <li>I did not purchase the light version of this product.  </li>
      <li>Not only is this lotion great on legs, I also use it on my chest and arms to cover up skin imperfections.  </li>
      <li>I used this product in light.</li>
      <li>I use the light one</li>
      <li>I have the palest skin you have ever seen , and started out using the light one ( as a start ) .</li>
      <li>On the advice of a friend, I ordered the light color and it is what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I was sent the shade Light, which is the lightest shade available.</li>
      <li>You do have to blend it in well, but it&#x27;s super easy to do.</li>
      <li>However, I was more interested in a cover-up than a self tanner.</li>
      <li>I was excited when I saw this product because I thought it might be easier than the spray can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, for any tanner, wearing latex gloves keep your hands clean, and it seems like product applies faster and easier.</li>
      <li>It goes on so easy and is not thick like most tanning creams.</li>
      <li>I like it really makes my legs look very smooth.</li>
      <li>I most certainly would.</li>
      <li>Amazzing product!!&lt;br /&gt;The covarage is meduim to full , it gives ur skin a glowy bronze look , the shades runs darker , i have a meduim bronze skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wish they didnt stop making the lighter shade. If you are very pale this is too dark. I have to use a very small amount and blend like crazy.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase the light version of this product.  I purchased the \\&quot;deep glow.\\&quot;  I am writing this because this product is so good.  I haven&#x27;t experienced tremors or anything such as another reviewer has indicated.  I am very fair, pink-skinned, freckled (you get the picture). I can&#x27;t use traditional self-tanners because of the allergic reaction I get.  This product goes a lon-n-n-g way.  I put on a lotion that dries quickly, but before it&#x27;s dry I then put a few drops of the tanner in strategic places. I spread it around my legs and arms thoroughly to give it an even appearance.  I sometimes brush a tissue over the top to get rid of any residue that might be there. This is better than the spray-on version of this tanner because it&#x27;s a lotion and doesn&#x27;t have any overspray to get on everything. I also think it stays on better and doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer to my clothing as much. Would I buy it again?  I most certainly would.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s review: I have spider veins and skin discoloration from poor blood flow after a clot in my leg. I also have very pale skin, so blemishes and veins are extremely noticeable. I avoid wearing skirts and shorts because of this, and am always looking for a product that will make me less embarrassed to show my legs. First, this product is much darker than I thought it would be, as a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; cover-up. Initially, I was horrified when it went on my legs. But the more I rubbed it in the less &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; and dark it looked. In my experimentation I found that if I put lotion on my legs about 20 min prior to application and then really rubbed the product in well, it looked fairly natural. If I had streaking or it was too dark, I went over it with a little extra lotion and that lightened it enough. This was especially important around my ankles and knees where skin is drier. In the end this provided a nice, light tan look to my legs. However, I was more interested in a cover-up than a self tanner. This product provided no cover-up as far as I could see. The darkening of my skin made the spider veins slightly less obvious, but they are still very visible. And the skin discoloration is as obvious as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would give this product 4 stars for a tanner (if you moisturize prior!) but only 1.5 stars as a cover-up. The spray on version of this tends to cover better, so I&#x27;ll probably just stick to that.</li>
    <li> INCREDIBLE TAN &amp; SUNSCREEN TOO!!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I also liked the spray version but prefer the lotion because it is less messy.  So, here&#x27;s the story....I have used this product for several years - not only to make my ghastly white legs look more tanned, but also to conceal a large birthmark I have on my right leg.  Last summer we had a cycling trip to Burgundy, France, and I had planned to get a spray tan prior to leaving the U.S.  However, we had so many things to do prior to leaving that I didn&#x27;t make it to our local LA Tan salon.  So we stopped at a drugstore prior to arriving at the airport, and I bought a tube of the Sally Hansen lotion.  Once in France, I applied it before we went to our &amp;#34;get acquainted dinner&amp;#34; and was pleased with the smooth results.  Next morning was an early rise, so had just a quick in-out shower prior to pedaling through Burgundy from 8am to 5pm .  That evening, everyone at dinner was complaining about their scorched legs - but mine were fine!  Long story short, I learned that I could shower, but avoid soaping up my legs, and my &amp;#34;suntan&amp;#34; would last several days.  Every 2-3 days or so, I would scrub it off and reapply - and sure enough I NEVER got ANY sunburn on my legs, yet others on our trip who had even applied high SPF products had glowing red legs.  And the best thing was that my legs looked great the whole time.  I have since learned that it also works well on my arms too - and again, as long as you don&#x27;t soap it down, the tan survives well through multiple showers!!!  It&#x27;s INCREDIBLE.  In fact as a sunscreen, it seems to work as well as zinc oxide - but much more attractive (and note that I am a fair-skinned red-head!!!)  THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Blends easily and long lasting..</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go near self tanners because of the streaking and orange fake look. This stuff is PERFECT, goes on so easy and looks so natural. I have very fair skin and since finding this product I won&#x27;t show my legs without it!!! I like this better than the spray airbrush legs also.. I feel it covers more better and easier to rub in.</li>
    <li> Looked great. I bought it for pale legs I am fair skinned. I wanted to wear white capris and white sandles but my legs looked awful. I used this product in light. It was hard to blend but worth the effort. My legs looked naturally tanned. However the lotion got on my pants and I had to change. I let it dry on my legs for 15 minutes but I somehow got a dot of the makeup on my pants. This stuff is messy and stains so put a towel on the floor first. I&#x27;ve read that the spray looks glittery, so I bought the lotion. No glitter in the lotion. Check out my legs in the picture- it was hard to capture in a picture but the difference was very obvious in real life. Click on the picture to see the whole thing. Recommend to anyone just apply sparingly and spread quickly and evenly. Then wash your hands and wrists immediately! also don&#x27;t touch your legs the rest of the night, because it does transfer!</li>
    <li> My sister has this product and let me try it before I bought it.It does not make my legs turn orange like other products do!</li>
    <li> I have such white legs and sally hansen airbrushegs made them look so good. It goes on so easy and is not thick like most tanning creams. Also doesnt leave residue on hands when your done or lines. Great product!</li>
    <li> Being a sun worshiper for many years, I became used to tanned legs during the summer months.  Wanting to stay out of the sun now, I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. The result was a matte finish on my legs - hardly a natural-looking tan. Will go back to the sunless tanning creams.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quick and as described.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and lasts well</li>
    <li> I like the Sally Hansen&#x27;s Airbrush legs. I am a very clear individual and tanning isn&#x27;t really an option. It did take several applications to get the slightest tint of brown. My only dislike is the odor that it has. It isn&#x27;t a bad one but you can tell that you are wearing product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Sooo much better than the sun tanning bronzers that leave your hands yellow or brown. This makeup looks very natural on your legs and stays on well until you wash it off. I&#x27;ve told many of my friends about this product since I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and freckles.  This product just turned me orange and didn&#x27;t cover much.  Hope it works better for you.</li>
    <li> I rely on this when I don&#x27;t have time for a sunless tanner application and it looks great.  Does go on a little orange at first but once it sets it is a very nice glow and really holds up for the entire day.  I recommend applying with one of the foam self-tanner mitts which will give you a nice, even application.</li>
    <li> *I received this product for review from Influenster*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Airbrush Legs is a leg makeup, so it is more like a liquid foundation that a fake tan product. It is designed to work just like a foundation to cover imperfections, and be lightweight and long-wearing. Airbrush Legs is oil free, and has a slight pigmentation available in six shades. I was sent the shade Light, which is the lightest shade available. I was very nervous when I first tested Airbrush Legs – the color is WAY too dark when it comes out of the bottle, and has that “orange fake tan” appearance. Luckily, it does blend out quite a bit to be a more wearable color, but it is still too dark for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Airbrush Legs definitely added some color to my legs. However, I don’t feel like it covered any imperfections whatsoever! My legs have a lot of imperfections, which is very noticeable with my fair skin. I was hoping Airbrush Legs would really cover up my pores and redness, but all that happened was that my legs got darker in color. I also noticed that the product clings to dry patches, leaving a dark brown appearance (not cute!). It’s also difficult to blend on feet and knees, and I had a bit of streakiness going on. I think that with more practice I could get a better application of Airbrush Legs, but because the shade was still too dark for my tastes, I don’t think I’ll be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, there was a lot I did really like about Airbrush Legs. First, it is odorless, unlike fake tanners, which can have a really terrible smell. In addition, Airbrush Legs dries really quickly and does not rub off on clothing or furniture. It does wash off really easily with soap and water, though. I also used a makeup wipe to touch up areas that were streaky, and that worked really well. Finally, my legs felt really soft to the touch after using this product. I really liked that there was no residue at all left behind on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do recommend Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs for those of you who are looking to darken your skin tone without grabbing a fake tanner. This is perfect for an event where you want to show off your legs! However, I wouldn’t recommend this product if you have fair skin, dry skin, and skin with a lot of imperfections. Airbrush Legs is not a cover-all product, so just keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photos and more at adventures-in-polishland.comnd Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs for those of you who are looking to darken your skin tone without grabbing a fake tanner.

    <li> I tried this and was extremely disappointed. Its orange-y, and thin and didn&#x27;t cover anything. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t  buy it, and had the chance to try it. Instead, I purchased 3 tubes of Wet n Wild coverall cover stick in light, light-medium, and medium.

    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I only wish I had known about it years ago!&lt;br /&gt;I used to see it at the drugstore and think it seemed like a really strange product.&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to try it out about a year ago and it&#x27;s so great.&lt;br /&gt;Blends away all of the imperfections in your legs.  Like the name says, they look airbrushed.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it gives a little bit of a tan color.  I use the light one and it&#x27;s definitely enough color (i&#x27;m a white girl - not super pale but not tan either).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like wearing nylons without being uncomfortable and plus you can wear with sandals and open toed heels...&lt;br /&gt;It really does stay on, too.  If you really rub on it it will transfer off but even when I get in the shower the stuff doesn&#x27;t come off until I start scrubbing with soap.  Try it out!</li>
    <li> Amazzing product!!&lt;br /&gt;The covarage is meduim to full , it gives ur skin a glowy bronze look , the shades runs darker , i have a meduim bronze skin and i orden the shade: fair and its still darker than my skin . And its waaay better that the spray</li>
    <li> I like this product but it is still a little orange in tone. Wish there were more color options.</li>
    <li> I am literally obsessed with this self tanner ! I have the palest skin you have ever seen , and started out using the light one ( as a start ) . Like many people have mentioned it does look a bit overwelming at first especially if you have pale skin as I do, but once you start rubbing it in you get a very NATURAL glow . Now I use the medium tone and I use it all over my body , and it looks as if I went to the Bahamas for a month . If your looking for a natural tan that&#x27;s NOT orange , then this is the self tanner for you ! It also dries super fast which is really convenient ! I Absoloutly LOVE it !</li>
    <li> I like the coverage and that it doesn&#x27;t have glitter!! But the color is too cinnamon for me. I add a little green concealer to it and that mellows it out.</li>
    <li> I really like this product as it doesn&#x27;t spray all over the room and floor when using it like the spray leg lotion. This goes on very smoothly and blends perfectly. I bought the light and it works fine to help cover uneven legs with veins or other imperfections. I use it on my ankles and feet too when I have sandles on. Have a nice look. Doesn&#x27;t come off too easily once it is dried so you don&#x27;t have it all over your clothing, etc.  No discernible smell which is great with me. I would definitely buy it again and Amazon&#x27;s price is the best I could find.</li>
    <li> Overall, I love the product.  However, if you&#x27;ve never used this then I recommend you go to the store and check the colors there against your skin.  Online it looked like the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; would be right for me, but after trying the product I realized that I really did need the &amp;#34;fairest&amp;#34; shade.  Also, most definitely give it time to dry before dressing and be careful pulling clothes on over this.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough! I have VERY pale skin, blonde hair, blue eyes. I can&#x27;t use fake tanners because I&#x27;m allergic to them, and I have had melanoma, so a natural tan is out (not like I could get tan anyway). I thought I was doomed to be ghostly white... but no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical to try this, thinking it was like face make up and would wipe off, transfer to my clothing, leave streaks if touched, etc. But it&#x27;s NOT. It&#x27;s like a very thick lotion that blends beautifully! I have tried the spray first, and it was fine, but it has glitter in it that I think looks weird. This one has no glitter and looks extremely natural. You do have to blend it in well, but it&#x27;s super easy to do. Very forgiving. Some people have said it&#x27;s orange, but I don&#x27;t have that issue. I think you have to blend it in really well, and not put too much on to get the natural look. It&#x27;s also awesome that you can go a couple of days -- as long as you don&#x27;t scrub your legs in the shower, this will last until you want to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find a bit of transfer onto white pants, but if you make sure it&#x27;s good and dry and give it time to set before putting on the white pants, you considerably lesson any transfer. I haven&#x27;t found any problems with transfer to sheets either, but I usually apply this in the morning, so by then it&#x27;s had plenty of time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is like a miracle to me. I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a like watered down version of the real thing don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding the lotion version in the store so I purchased on Amazon.  This works well, I mix it with regular lotion so it is not so thick.  Nice color, not orange or fake looking.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned and I really like this product.  It does appear to be an orange tone, but as a fair redhead, my skin gets a peachy tone on the rare day I get a tan.  I have spider veins and this tones them down significantly.</li>
    <li> This product was too sheer for my purpose.  I wanted to cover spider veins and other blemishes but you could still see them after this product was applied.</li>
    <li> I love my legs with Sally on them. My legs are white with a lot of spider veins. I could not be happier. I have been wearing Sally everyday for about two months. After one month, I told my husband. He admitted that because he knew my legs he knew I was using something, but that to the untrained eye they looked natural and great! I love my legs again! I go to the beach without worry, cause it is waterproof. It does not transfer to my white dresses or shorts and looks so natural once dry. Some have cemented on the orange color right out of the bottle and I agree, but once dry and smoothed in that&#x27;s all gone. I&#x27;ve bought two bottles and am buying my third! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Fairest is it&#x27;s too dark and orange. I have a light medium complexion and can&#x27;t even imagine how this would look on someone who is truly fair. I hoped that I&#x27;d see the results others mentioned after rubbing and blending it in well. I didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s still too dark. I would really like to see a TRUE fair version of this spray. As another reviewer mentioned, the former Nude Glow color worked extremely, because it was a neutral beige - not orange. I didn&#x27;t buy this for a tan, but as an enhancer to my skin tone while covering some minor imperfections. I won&#x27;t waste my money on this product again.</li>
    <li> OMG can you say flawless. My legs look so good with this product.  The spray on kind left my legs shimmery so this is definitely classier, but takes a little bit longer to apply</li>
    <li> A hot summer day and last minute change to a dress and sandals, compelled me to grab a sample I had of Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs instead of my usual L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronzer (which takes a few minutes to dry). I was pleased with how easy SHAL was to apply and the fine matte finish it gave my legs. The sample was in the Light shade, and I would have chosen medium or dark, but I was pleased with the coverage and how evenly it went on. SHAL lasted the whole day and evening. It gives a nice look as if I wore sheer pantyhose. I am only giving this four stars until I use this more. The first photo show the SHAL leg on the left in bathroom light; and second photo the SHAL leg is on the right in filtered sunlight from the screen door. (What is with the bottle shadow?? oh, my cell phone case is shaped like a bottle of Absolut Vodka!) Also, for any tanner, wearing latex gloves keep your hands clean, and it seems like product applies faster and easier.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say I thought it would cover veins however it is orange on my  skin and doesn&#x27;t cover them.  I&#x27;ve misplaced the packaging or I would return it as I cannot use it.  I do use other Sally products and am satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff! The color and smooth application covers everything and looks great on my skin! My elderly mother uses it on her arms to hide age spots..it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
    <li> Geesh, I read all the reveiw and went for it anyway due to some positive responses.  ORANGE !  I washed it off right away.</li>
    <li> It is too dark for my skin!!!</li>
    <li> As someone with imperfect legs, I LOVE Sally Hansen leg makeup and have been using the spray can version for years. I was excited when I saw this product because I thought it might be easier than the spray can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product still provides great coverage but has a matte finish instead of the nylon-like subtle sparkle glow of the spray can. This may be a plus for some, but I like the sparkle!</li>
    <li> I never wear shorts or skirts because I have terrible spider and varicose veins on my lower legs...plus I&#x27;m super pale. Not a good look. I purchased this after many searches and watching a couple of video reviews on YouTube, and have to agree with what I read/heard--it&#x27;s a great product. It definitely looks orangey (against pale skin) when you first put it on but it ultimately gives a smooth, natural-colored look. Although it doesn&#x27;t fully hide my vein issues, it made me comfortable enough to wear a skirt during the day for the first time in eons. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again as long as the Light color is available.</li>
    <li> Convinent ,non messy and last a long time and waterproof comes in diffarent shades depending on your skin tone.</li>
    <li> It works really good, at first goes on a little yellow but once you rub it in real good it looks more natural. It doesn&#x27;t completely cover up varicose vanes but that&#x27;s understandable at least it hides them some</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time today. It&#x27;s got a slightly orange hue, and my skin is white/pink, so it looks a little unnatural to me. Regardless, it looks pretty good on. I read reviews that said to keep rubbing it out, because if you stop too soon you&#x27;ll have streaks. Following that advise, it covered quite well. I have very, very white legs and spider veins, and this helped tone down the spider veins and give some decent color to them. My skin is also somewhat dry, and I read that if you add lotion before applying this product it will rub off. After wearing this on my legs all day (at work, under slacks, because I wanted to see how it wears), I noticed it did not rub off on the inside of my slacks, but my skin looked dry, so I applied some lotion. None of the product rubbed off when I applied the lotion, which surprised me. I will be using this when I go on vacation for sure. I really do wish there was a product with a less orange hue, but since this is all I have to choose from, I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
    <li> So thick and turned me orange</li>
    <li> I read every one of the reviews prior to purchasing this tanning product.  Most of the complaints were not of a splotchy, uneven tan, but of orange tone results.  So after using the product, I have to say that my skin did, in fact, turn a yellowy orange which was disappointing because I really liked the way it applied.  Think applying cream make-up to your legs.  I had no splotching or uneven tan, just orange legs.  And it wasn&#x27;t difficult to apply in order to attain an even tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, would someone else notice the orange tone on me?  I&#x27;m not sure, but I think now that I know what color it produces, I would notice this on someone else.  It doesn&#x27;t really look natural.  Some reviewers said that the orange goes away after a while.  Mine did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note...the product did dry rather quickly before I got dressed, didn&#x27;t smear once I did, and has absolutely no smell whatsoever.  With these positive attributes for a bottle-tan, I wish Sally Hansen would work diligently on the color it produces.  If the color was right, it would be a very-perfect 10.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have very pale legs. Like, ghost white. They just refuse to tan. So in the past I&#x27;ve tried several spray and wipe on tanning agents. They all looked absolutely awful and very orange. But I&#x27;d read very good things about this stuff so I decided to give it a try. When I first started to apply it I thought, Oh Lord, another orange disaster. But I rubbed and blended and kept at it, and the color is actually quite nice. Still a tad orangey to me, but that&#x27;s due to how very pale my legs were to start with. My husband, however, disagreed said it looked like they looked nice and natural. Will this stuff turn your legs tan tan like you live on the beach? Probably need the medium for that, but maybe if you applied a lot more than I did. To me this is a realistic look for my complexion and skin tone. It looks natural. It dried quickly and there was no transfer to clothes or bedding at all. I had to blend for a few minutes, but in the end it wasn&#x27;t splotchy or streaky at all. It really does look quite natural, and I would recommend it to anyone needing a little extra glow (or to not frighten people with glow in the dark legs).</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and found this too dark for me initially. But then I cut it with moisturizing lotion and achieved a decent effect. Still a little streaking, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s to do with my impatient application.</li>
    <li> I love this product and pretty much can&#x27;t show my legs without it. It looks kind of scary and orange when you first rub it in, but you just have to take a few minutes to rub it in and pay attention that you are doing so evenly. It looks so natural and I can&#x27;t believe how well it stays on! It won&#x27;t come off if you just get wet... I have to scrub it off with a soapy loofa. I&#x27;ve never had issues with it getting on my clothes or sheets once it&#x27;s dried. I&#x27;ve tried other different tinted lotions or CC lotions that claim to perfect your skin and have seen no results. This is more or less leg makeup and really does cover up flaws well (my skin is sensitive and I struggle with ingrowns and irritation). I have fair skin and have used both the light and medium with natural looking results.</li>
    <li> I had been using the product similar to this in the spray bottle, but that has a fair amount of shimmer/glitter. Not that I have anything against glitter... I love glitter, but it is not always appropriate for what I am wearing. This lotion covers all imperfections extremely well, and with no glitter. With this product I am able to wear shorts and skirts without stockings or hose. And since I have very pale skin, this stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very easy to apply. A great tip is to step outside in natural light (if possible) to get a good look that you haven&#x27;t missed any areas. It looks very natural on, and doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothes or bed sheets. Then just wash off with soap and water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the color (light) to be perfect for me. A light tan color, with no orange tones that I can see.&lt;br /&gt;I am stocking up on this product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this leg make-up.  Goes on smoothly---just needs good blending.  Stays put after setting.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with staining/melting, etc.  This is a must have for giving pantyhose the boot!</li>
    <li> I love Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs Spray so I thought I&#x27;d try the lotion. I didn&#x27;t have the best results-it was very spotty and streaky for me. What I love about the spray is how quickly you can get an even and natural looking tan, not so much with the lotion. It may work for other people but I prefer the spray.</li>
    <li> On the advice of a friend, I ordered the light color and it is what I was looking for.  It is easy to apply and I can even moisturize my legs before using.  I read and followed the directions for applying it using the motto &amp;#34;less is best!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My complexion is caramel. I received a sample medium shade. It was very close to my leg color. I used it to even my leg color so that I could go bare legged with dressy sandals. It&#x27;s waterproof and didn&#x27;t smear on my clothes. The lotion is easy to apply. My legs looked great.</li>
    <li> I like it really makes my legs look very smooth. Only reason didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it is hard to get it blended all over your leg. I would go outside and see little streak here and there. But the more I used it the more I blend. You can never blend to much!  Update: Well I had four stars on this product and even used a whole bottle. However, I have found from other people that this product make my legs more orangey then tan. I learn they was completely right and it so blotchy the next day! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, it is not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> 15 minutes after applying Airbrush Legs by Sally Hansen - my hands had severe tremors.  No associated anxiety.  I thoroughly washed off the product from my legs and the tremors stopped after about 15 minutes but I have had 2 restless nights of sleep. I have not seen any reports like this - but I had a negative physical reaction to this product. I could not post this without checking a star</li>
    <li> Thrilled this product now available as cream, in addition to the spray.  I use about two times/week and my legs look GREAT.  I am not all that fair -- part Italian but the light tends to be more natural looking for my legs than the tan/bronze shade</li>
    <li> Not only is this lotion great on legs, I also use it on my chest and arms to cover up skin imperfections.  It dries quickly to a smooth matte finish, and is  pretty much water proof. It does not come off on my clothes at all, and will last through a few showers.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I recommend it highly!</li>
