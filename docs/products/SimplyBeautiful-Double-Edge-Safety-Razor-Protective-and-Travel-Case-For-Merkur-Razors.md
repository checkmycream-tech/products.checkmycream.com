### Positive Reviews

      <li>This is a good case, nothing fancy about it.</li>
      <li>looks good.</li>
      <li>Great fit for Mekur, exposed rivet inside of case.</li>
      <li>Came in handy during a hiking trip overseas.</li>
      <li>Nice quality too.</li>
      <li>This sheath is well made; the leather is nicely cut and sewn.  </li>
      <li>Covers my razor and fits nicely in my travel kit.</li>
      <li>So its a nice razor case</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great gift for my someone special.</li>
      <li>The Merkur original is good to go out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product thinking it was the beautiful real leather one in the picture.</li>
      <li>Holds the Merkur just fine!</li>
      <li>Not leather, looks very cheap but it will do for now</li>
      <li>Unlike most safety razor cases, this case can handle a variety of razor types.  </li>
      <li>im sure</li>
      <li>All in all, it is an ok deal.tes.      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok not a biggy,</li>
      <li>All in all, it is an ok deal.</li>
      <li>It looks nice but it feels cheap.</li>
      <li>The Merkur is made of slightly better, softer material -</li>
      <li>But I guess that helps protect it better.</li>
      <li>Nothing redeeming about this thing.</li>
      <li>It could be made of a better material like leather or a better material that doesn&#x27;t look so cheap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like many have said...</li>
      <li>It is barely ok.</li>
      <li>This case helps keep my stuff from being beaten up, and my razor still nice and clean for when I need it.</li>
      <li>True, you could just rape your razor in paper or something, but this is nice,  sturdy and Wong unravel in travel case.</li>
      <li>Hopefully it will fit better in time as the leather breaks in.  </li>
      <li>-It is fairly easy to restitch the case to more snugly fit your razor and to trim off the excess material, as I did with mine.  </li>
      <li>Will work fine for my needs at this time.  </li>
      <li>So...eh its cheap but works fine.</li>
      <li>The item is actually a cheap knock-off of what is pictured and described,</li>
      <li>And, to be frank, The picture does nothing to dissuade this notion, since it&#x27;s primary picture has the handle in it as well.</li>
      <li>Nice slim design and doesn&#x27;t take up much space in your travel kit.</li>
      <li>Product just as detailed.</li>
      <li>In addition, the case was so cheap that the stiching was ripped when it arrived.</li>
      <li>Instead you get a cheap BROWN version that is not felt-lined.</li>
      <li>Would take a razor with a longer handle comfortably also.</li>
      <li>It seemed to form fit</li>
      <li>Great quality overall.</li>
      <li>This is an incredibly cheap case.</li>
      <li>-The material and stitching are cheap and look it.  </li>
      <li>With the snap cover the case holds the razor securely.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Do not buy unless you think the cheap price justifies a cheap case.</li>
      <li>Misleading description makes you think that it is leather, but it is some cheap vinyl case.</li>
      <li>I have since ordered one from a real shaving site and the real one is much more nicely finished, has the Dovo logo on the snap on button like the picture on this Amazon page, and has a cover over the snap on metal inside the sheath to prevent it from scratching the razor.</li>
      <li>The Merkur logo is on the front of the snap in the original, and the side of the snap grommet that faces the razor is covered, while this is not, posing a threat of scratching the razor while one inserts it.  </li>
      <li>Soft Leather, but kind of a cheap snap.</li>
      <li>The button used to safely close the case has metal in both sides, which will naturally rub against your precious razor as you slide it in and out the case.</li>
      <li>I have a beard, making it very important to have, not just a mow-them-down mentality razor, but one that is capable of doing close edging and borders on the contours of the face.</li>
      <li>it came in on time, serves its purpose, nothing special.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He was right!</li>
      <li>That is not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is of adequate thickness and quality</li>
      <li>It feels like it wants to just split apart, the materials are super-cheap, but so far, so good.</li>
      <li>A nice simple case for safety razor, great for use with already loaded razor in Dopp bag to prevent from slicing other toiletry essentials.</li>
      <li>BE AWARE!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not even worth the return postage.</li>
      <li>twice as worth it?  </li>
      <li>It is definitely worth the inexpensive price.</li>
      <li>is the logo snap worth to you.  </li>
      <li>Its simple, honest and it works.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good buy for the 7 and change I paid for it.</li>
      <li>I was very dissapointed to see it was not an original Dovo item, the images shown are missleading.</li>
      <li>For the price it is a very good travel case for my double edge razor, I highly recommend this for someone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend allot for a double edge razor traveling case</li>
      <li>The photo makes the leather look to be a much higher quality than what is received.</li>
      <li>The one I received is not the exact one as pictured.</li>
      <li>This one fits many different size razors including the Muhle r41, Edwing Jagger 89 and even the Merkur Futur.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really tight fit, but I&#x27;m able to squeeze it in there.   </li>
      <li>But these are really just fine for my old Gillettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does feel a bit thin and flimsy but I tried putting my razor in it and it fit and looked good in it.</li>
      <li>The old timmers had it right the first time with a double edge razor and the case makes it easy for travel.  </li>
      <li>This was a nice little case for travel.</li>
      <li>Protective travel case is the only thing that accurate about this item.</li>
      <li>Nothing to rave about, nor to really complain about.</li>
      <li>Have just used it on a two week campervan trip and performed very well.</li>
      <li>Look at the pictures I posted of the REAL sheath.</li>
      <li>I also have a real Merkur version.  </li>
      <li>The Merkur is twice as much...</li>
      <li>Two stars only becouse the razor that will make it a home, fit.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not even worth it to send back.</li>
      <li>The other two pictures looked more like accents to the main, rather than the main product.</li>
      <li>But truthfully, the Merkur version is not worth the $15 or so that it costs.  </li>
      <li>The black one looks better which is what I thought I was ordering.</li>
      <li>A Merkur 180, Gillette Slim Adjustable Black Handle Long, or Gillette Slim Adjustable all fit comfortably.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d have to be rough or travel a lot for it to significantly scratch your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This travel case is very soft leather.</li>
      <li>Maybe in the future i will invest some more money on a more expensive one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Take a  minute to read this please.  I was in such a hurry to purchase this after seeing the accompanying picture.  Had I only read the caption that said \\&quot;this photo is of the real thing [in contrast to what is being sold]. I also have a real Merkur version.  A few contrasts:  The Merkur is made of slightly better, softer material - none of these are leather, or at least not good leather.  The Merkur logo is on the front of the snap in the original, and the side of the snap grommet that faces the razor is covered, while this is not, posing a threat of scratching the razor while one inserts it.  But truthfully, the Merkur version is not worth the $15 or so that it costs.  That accounts for my eagerness to get one for about half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These basically do the job intended.  You can get two at about $20 with shipping when two Merkur versions would be $34 (?).  So to make this generic version workable, I had to do two things.  (1)  The case needs to be stretched before attempting to insert a razor.  I did this by inserting the handled end of a scrwedriver.  I used two.  First a thinner one, and then after a few minutes, a thicker handled one.  That stretched out the interior sufficiently that my Gillette Fatboy went in easily.&lt;br /&gt; (2) To protect the razor from scratches from the snap, I cut out a small square of felt and glued it over the snap.  This is essentially what is done in the Merkur case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these two simple improvements, I have a workable solution.  I also think the hood of this sheath is slightly smaller than the Merkur, which means for a tighter wrap and snap around the razor head.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it may boil down to how much is the logo snap worth to you.  The Merkur original is good to go out of the box.  This took some minor adjustment.  The Merkur is twice as much...twice as worth it?  I think if i buy another Merkur razor, I will get the official case for it. But these are really just fine for my old Gillettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the product description would clearly (and repeatedly) state what it is and what it is not, then I think there would be no problem.  All in all, it is an ok deal.tes.      If the product description would clearly (and repeatedly) state what it is and what it is not, then I think there would be no problem.  All in all, it is an ok deal.</li>
    <li> I have a Merkur 180 with the long handle and I was concerned that this sheath would be too short.   It&#x27;s a really tight fit, but I&#x27;m able to squeeze it in there.   Hopefully it will fit better in time as the leather breaks in.  This sheath is well made; the leather is nicely cut and sewn.  It would be 5 stars except for the price.  After shipping was added on, it seems a little excessive for just a little piece of leather.</li>
    <li> I have the Merkur short handle razor.  This case fit perfectly over the razor head and protects the blade.  Since I have the short handle the length of the case was a couple millimeters long but not an issue.  With the snap cover the case holds the razor securely.  Great product and price!</li>
    <li> Meet the need. Not exactly a work of art but protects the razor. Use it when traveling.</li>
    <li> You could live without this little gem if you carry extra band aids..  I do alot of traveling.  Reaching for a double edge razor and blade in a dimmly lit bathroom in a dark travel case can produce unwanted extra morning repair.  The travel case protects the hands and fingers AND keeps that blade from unwanted nicks.  It has worked for me.  As others have mentioned about the quality of the leather, I will say that it is not the best quality of leather, if it is leather.</li>
    <li> I ordered from an Amazon marketplace vendor and what I received was clearly NOT the real Merkur leather sheath. It is not the same as the picture on the item page. I have since ordered one from a real shaving site and the real one is much more nicely finished, has the Dovo logo on the snap on button like the picture on this Amazon page, and has a cover over the snap on metal inside the sheath to prevent it from scratching the razor. Look at the pictures I posted of the REAL sheath. BE AWARE!</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m a little confused by this product. First, it&#x27;s name is oblique and confusing, and the way it&#x27;s worded lead me to believe that it should come with razor handle, as WELL as the travel case. Then, there&#x27;s the immense lack of description stating anything, much less other-wise. And, to be frank, The picture does nothing to dissuade this notion, since it&#x27;s primary picture has the handle in it as well. The other two pictures looked more like accents to the main, rather than the main product. Given the misleading nature of the item, I&#x27;d give it less than a whole star, if I could.</li>
    <li> This is not the Merkur case that is advertised! There is no Dovo logo on the snap and there is no protection over the inside snap metal as shown in the advertisement. Don&#x27;t buy this product, it is not as advertised! In addition, the case was so cheap that the stiching was ripped when it arrived. I returned it immediately. Don&#x27;t waste your time buying something that is not as advertised and will need to be returned.</li>
    <li> does what it is suppose to</li>
    <li> So its a nice razor case but it is not a merkur product even though its portraid as one in the description it is just a plane Jane leather case</li>
    <li> Well made leather razor case that does an excellent job. Wanted a simple double edge travel case for my razors. This one fits many different size razors including the Muhle r41, Edwing Jagger 89 and even the Merkur Futur.</li>
    <li> As a long user of the faithful (and dangerous) double edge razor, this is a very well made and effective instrument for keeping back the inner barbarian of men&#x27;s nature. I have a beard, making it very important to have, not just a mow-them-down mentality razor, but one that is capable of doing close edging and borders on the contours of the face. Great item!</li>
    <li> This case does the job of protecting my Merkur 34 C razor for when I travel. The leather material seems cheap though, and I had to work hard to flex the material so that I could get the handle of my razor into the case. But overall it&#x27;s a decent case, and hopefully will last a while.</li>
    <li> I used to have to wrap my razor so it doesn&#x27;t beat up other items in my toiletry bag.  This case helps keep my stuff from being beaten up, and my razor still nice and clean for when I need it.</li>
    <li> The black one looks better which is what I thought I was ordering. I go a tan one instead. It does feel a bit thin and flimsy but I tried putting my razor in it and it fit and looked good in it. HAven&#x27;t used it to travel yet but will soon.</li>
    <li> This is a good case, nothing fancy about it. It holds a safety razor with no problems. It is definitely worth the inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> Like many have said... this item is Fraudulent!! it is pictured as the Merkur brand case, it is NOT. There is not even a felt covering over the snap to protect the razor as is claimed.</li>
    <li> Not leather, looks very cheap but it will do for now</li>
    <li> Great quality overall. Stitching, material, and button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money!</li>
    <li> This travel case does the job, but I thought it was black. It turns out it&#x27;s like a dark green. It&#x27;s not very thick sturdy leather either. But hey, it does the job!</li>
    <li> If you are planning to put a razor you care for inside of this.. DON&#x27;T DO IT. Trust me you might end up regretting it. The button used to safely close the case has metal in both sides, which will naturally rub against your precious razor as you slide it in and out the case. If you got a Razor you care for, stay away from this item.</li>
    <li> Works well and has saved my husband from other nasty cuts.</li>
    <li> ...and all because I didn&#x27;t look at these reviews. What you see here is NOT what you get. Instead you get a cheap BROWN version that is not felt-lined. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not even worth it to send back.</li>
    <li> Product just as detailed. As other product reviews claim that there&#x27;s no cover inside for the metal and those scratched the razor, this one HAS padding and that&#x27;s avoided. I have a Merkur Futur and it worked great. Delivery was within promised and no issues at all. Would buy from this vendor again if needed.</li>
    <li> For the price it is a very good travel case for my double edge razor, I highly recommend this for someone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend allot for a double edge razor traveling case</li>
    <li> just cheap, thin and too flimsy for my tastes, but it&#x27;s done the job now for about a year. The clasp doesn&#x27;t always line up, so snapping it can be a pain sometimes. It feels like it wants to just split apart, the materials are super-cheap, but so far, so good. Once this breaks, I won&#x27;t be replacing it with this one.</li>
    <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose. It is not a luxury case my  any stretch of the imagination. Covers my razor and fits nicely in my travel kit. The photo makes the leather look to be a much higher quality than what is received.</li>
    <li> I just received my travel sheath and unlike one of the previous reviews, my sheath does have the exposed metal grommet on the inside which can possibly scratch a chrome or nickle plated handle. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good buy for the 7 and change I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I was very dissapointed to see it was not an original Dovo item, the images shown are missleading. I won&#x27;t even bother analyzing the delivered item.</li>
    <li> Soft Leather, but kind of a cheap snap. Won&#x27;t hold up. Had to replace.</li>
    <li> fit the Merkur razor just perfect. But man, its snug. But I guess that helps protect it better. Nice quality too.</li>
    <li> The product in photo will lead anyone contemplating this purchase to believe it&#x27;s the one you will receive.DEAD WRONG. Dont do yourself like I did and trust this company to deliver the correct merchandise. Two stars only becouse the razor that will make it a home, fit. Run from this product and get the other razor case advertised here on amazon.</li>
    <li> The old timmers had it right the first time with a double edge razor and the case makes it easy for travel.  I never leave home with out it.</li>
    <li> Just placed an order for this product and expect only generic leather case for under 10 bucks. That&#x27;s it. Not expecting Merkur, Edwin Jagger, Ikon, or other high class razor along with it.</li>
    <li> looks good. functions as it should, inexpensive</li>
    <li> CONS:   -The material and stitching are cheap and look it.  -The case is too long for my razor and looked awkward.  -The snap is left exposed on the inside of the case and could scratch the finish of your razor.  PROS:  -This product does hold my Edwin Jagger.  -It is fairly easy to restitch the case to more snugly fit your razor and to trim off the excess material, as I did with mine.  -The exposed snap may not damage your razor.  Mine seems to be remaining unmarred.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it was the beautiful real leather one in the picture. It&#x27;s not....It&#x27;s the world&#x27;s cheapest knock-off of this product and it will scratch your razor. I&#x27;m just going to count my money as a loss as I figure it&#x27;s not even worth the return postage. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you like paying a lot of money for a 75 cent product.</li>
    <li> This traveling case fits my safety razor perfectly. Came in handy during a hiking trip overseas. Will be using as long as the product lasts.</li>
    <li> Unlike most safety razor cases, this case can handle a variety of razor types.  A Merkur 180, Gillette Slim Adjustable Black Handle Long, or Gillette Slim Adjustable all fit comfortably.</li>
    <li> perfect for carrying youre safety razor. It could be made of a better material like leather or a better material that doesn&#x27;t look so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job</li>
    <li> Misleading description makes you think that it is leather, but it is some cheap vinyl case. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a case that fits my Merkur (barely) and it has worked for the two weeks I&#x27;ve owned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the case in the pictures. It&#x27;s not black; mine is dark green. It is not leather, although it may be something reconstituted from leather with synthetic fibers. It does not protect the two ends of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Do not buy unless you think the cheap price justifies a cheap case.</li>
    <li> My father used the Gilette double edge all of his life (and while he was fighting in WW II&amp;#60; so i thought I&#x27;d check out what Dad knew that I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;He was right!</li>
    <li> Frequent amazon shopper, so making a 9 dollar purchase wasn&#x27;t a big decision.  Could be my eyesight but I thought the pic was black nor did I see an option for any other color, but mine came in Brown??  It&#x27;s ok not a biggy, im sure if I would have mentioned it they would have sent a black one, although not worth my time.  Last is that I already notice a tear in the inside flap where the edge of the razor must have rubbed against the case.  Don&#x27;t know how long it will last, or that may be the worst of it.  In conclusion, I&#x27;m indifferent/neutral to the product.  Nothing to rave about, nor to really complain about. For that my friend 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I think its plastic.  It didn&#x27;t cost a lot.  It works but the description is somewhat euphemistic. It is barely ok.</li>
    <li> Will work fine for my needs at this time.  I was a little disappointed in the leather quality, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain to much.  for someone who needs a case occasionally it will work.</li>
    <li> I really hate it. This is the worst item ever.  There is no way to put the merkur DE razor in this leather case. If you do , it will not close and I do not have the long Mekur razor. The workmanship is poor. The adhesive sticks to your hand. I do not know why they use adhesive if it is stitched. A novice will know looking at it that it will not work.  I Will not recommend to anyone. If I could write a review without even giving a start, I would; unfortunately to write a review, you have to give at least a star.</li>
    <li> Fits my Edwin Jagger DE razor perfectly. Would take a razor with a longer handle comfortably also. Have just used it on a two week campervan trip and performed very well.</li>
    <li> They work for what I need them for.  However, they could have made them from a bit heavier materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will do the job though.</li>
    <li> Cheap, thin leather, if it is real leather at all.  Poor stitching.  Unfinished edges.  Exposed snap inside will scratch your razor.  Actual value: about 5 cents.  Amazon should not even carry this product, and the seller should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> A nice simple case for safety razor, great for use with already loaded razor in Dopp bag to prevent from slicing other toiletry essentials. True, you could just rape your razor in paper or something, but this is nice,  sturdy and Wong unravel in travel case.</li>
    <li> Protective travel case is the only thing that accurate about this item. The material is a synthetic. How do I know this, I tried to dye it with black leather dye and it would not penetrate the material. All the treads turned black. As a result it looks like distressed leather now. The inside is lined and the razor fits well in it and the snap does work. A bit long but It will work for a longer handle. It covers the entire DE I have in my travel kit. I have to remind myself this is for travel only and does the job. Reaching into a shaving kit with open blades in it is just not smart. It does the job like the heading says.</li>
    <li> This is an incredibly cheap case. The metal closure clasp inside the case is exposed. It will scratch your razor&#x27;s handle each time you insert or remove it. There is sticky glue all along the side seams of the case. Spend a few bucks more...get something decent.</li>
    <li> The item is actually a cheap knock-off of what is pictured and described, even the customer&#x27;s pictures associated with this listing is wrong. What you actually get is a brown (not black like pictured) leather sheath with no protective lining, i.e. your razor will get scratched in this casing. Returning mine the day as soon as I opened the box, it is a shame such deceptive sellers are on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not a quality product, but it definitely does the job.</li>
    <li> This travel case is very soft leather. The razor fits perfectly inside. It&#x27;s a great gift for my someone special.</li>
    <li> Its simple, honest and it works. Protects your razor and everything else around your personal hygiene case. I recommenced this product to anyone that travels.</li>
    <li> The button broke 2 minutes after I removed it from the packaging. I still use it, but it won&#x27;t snap closed. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great fit for Mekur, exposed rivet inside of case.</li>
    <li> Holds the Merkur just fine!</li>
    <li> VERY SMALL RAZOR CAN&#x27;T SLIDE INTO CASE!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what he was expecting but he like it alot</li>
    <li> Overall: As others have indicated the item shown in the image is not what you&#x27;ll receive. The item shipped is not the Merkur case shown. That said, aside from the exposed metal snap inside the case its not half bad. You&#x27;d have to be rough or travel a lot for it to significantly scratch your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Material is of adequate thickness and quality&lt;br /&gt;-Good design overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Seller&#x27;s image misrepresents what you will recieve&lt;br /&gt;-Exposed snap could scratch razor over time</li>
    <li> Just wanted a little extra something for my fiancee&#x27;s new razor. This was a nice little case for travel. Like it!</li>
    <li> It looks nice but it feels cheap. The price is my favourite. The leather is thin and the button looks like it couldnt last long. Maybe in the future i will invest some more money on a more expensive one.</li>
    <li> it came in on time, serves its purpose, nothing special. The one I received is not the exact one as pictured. I just needed something inexpensive that kept me from slicing my fingers while trying to fish around my toiletry box while half awake. (I work away from home 10 days out of the month.) So...eh its cheap but works fine.</li>
    <li> It fits snug on my razor.  I recently used it on a cruise and it worked as it should in my shaving kit.  It seemed to form fit the longer it stayed on my razor.</li>
    <li> This thing is crap. It&#x27;s a hard leather case that will dull your blades and is a cheap dollar store item.  Nothing redeeming about this thing.</li>
    <li> The item is actually a cheap knock-off of what is pictured and described, even the customer&#x27;s pictures associated with this listing show a DOVO embossed snap and they are wrong. What you actually get is a brown (not black like pictured) leather sheath with no protective lining against the snap, i.e. your razor will get scratched in this casing. Returning mine complained to AMAZON and all I got is a return label and an apology. It is a shame such deceptive sellers are on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Just as the title states, Simply Beautiful.</li>
    <li> Nice slim design and doesn&#x27;t take up much space in your travel kit.</li>
