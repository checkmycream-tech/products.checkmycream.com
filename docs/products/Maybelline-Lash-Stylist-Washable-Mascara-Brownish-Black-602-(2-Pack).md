      <li>the magic is in the application wand (comb).</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mascara.</li>
      <li>Why is it that when you find a product you really love that they discontinue it?  </li>
      <li>It would be interesting to find out why Maybelline doesn&#x27;t sell this in stores any longer</li>
      <li>I love this product because of the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; instead of the brush on the end.  </li>

      <li>I love this product and cannot find it in the stores.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited to see this product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Good product came brand new!</li>
      <li>When I washed my face it was easy to remove</li>
      <li>This is by far the most superior product I&#x27;ve ever used on my lashes.  </li>
      <li>I can continue to use my favorite product by purchasing it right here on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t have issues with clumps that i had before, so it was fine</li>
      <li>The mascara itself is fine.</li>
      <li>I have light fine lashes.</li>
      <li>The mini comb applicator is smooth going on and doesn&#x27;t clump up at all.  </li>
      <li>I just wish it was still in production and available in stores.</li>
      <li>nothing works except Neutrogena weightless volume wax free which is no longer available.</li>
      <li>I will use this till it isn&#x27;t available any longer.</li>
      <li>When I wore this mascara for the first time I was on a trip to NYC and my lashes looked better than ever.</li>
      <li>Since, much to my chagrin, it was discontinued by Maybelline, I was very fortunate to find it here at Amazon.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly and evenly and wears very well.</li>
      <li>After a full day of walking on windy streets, riding subways and taxis and just being on the go till 1:00 a.m.</li>
      <li>It makes my lashes look fake (in a good way), people always ask if I&#x27;m wearing falsies, lol.  </li>
      <li>The comb works so much better then the normal mascara brushes.</li>
      <li>This mascara was exactly what I was hoping for and it delivered!</li>
      <li>this product is amazing, i got so many compliments, my friends also started ordering this mascara from amazon since it&#x27;s not available in the market.</li>
      <li>I ordered several and will check to see if it is still available and order more.    </li>
      <li>It is different from the brush kind</li>
      <li>Another thing I like to do is just wash off the wand and put it in a different company&#x27;s mascara if I like the formula (the top has to fit,</li>
      <li>This is due to the seller because I loved this brush and never had a problem with it when purchased fresh at the store</li>
      <li>Apparently this mascara is no longer on the market, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and for a very god price (in spite of paying postage).</li>
      <li>Wanted to say Thanks!</li>
      <li>Fast, reliable shipping!</li>
      <li>Would love to get my money back !!!!!!</li>
      <li>it is not only my favorite but</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s been my favorite for years and the only mascara that works for me in the non-clumping department.    </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>For me, I prefer the standard mascara brush wand to this type, but I am sure some people prefer this type of wand</li>
      <li>This Mascara is a personal favorite but is discontinued in drug stores.  </li>
      <li>Also, the price is really convenient!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>This is the only mascara I have found with a comb and like another reviewer said you cant beat the difference in application, Maybeline made the UN-wise decision to discontinue it and Amazon is the only place I can find it, this 2 for one deal is pretty good</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nothing makes your lashed stand out more than this product, NOTHING. It is superb and easy to use every day</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older, my lashes have gotten thinner.  Mascara with brushes just don&#x27;t do the trick any more.  I find that this mascara with a comb delivers more product better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I won&#x27;t go back to mascara with a brush!</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I have found with a comb and like another reviewer said you cant beat the difference in application, Maybeline made the UN-wise decision to discontinue it and Amazon is the only place I can find it, this 2 for one deal is pretty good so I stocked up for now. I recommend this seller and the product.</li>
    <li> SO happy to have my favorite mascara again! works better than anything that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. The comb makes it much easier to use and it makes your lashes cleaner and longer with no smudges or smears. Have recommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know why Maybelline stopped making this product. It is by far the best mascara I have ever used. The formula and the comb are wonderful. The comb may take a little practice but not much and when you get the hang of it, you will LOVE it. Just don&#x27;t let it totally dry between coats, if you even need more than one.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! I didn&#x27;t realize they had stopped making this product until I finally found it here.  I thought my local store had just stopped carrying it.  I am so blue--this is the best mascara ever!  I&#x27;m stocking up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looking for this mascara at every pharmacy like CVS, RIDE A. Finally I found it on Amazon.com!!Product arrived on time. It&#x27;s what I was expecting. An A++ Seller!!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara.  I don&#x27;t know why Maybelline quit making this product.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome mascara - gives you thicker and fuller lashes.  I have really thin lashes and its hard for me to find something that will make them thicker and not clump them together.  The comb works so much better then the normal mascara brushes.</li>
    <li> This Mascara is a personal favorite but is discontinued in drug stores.  I love that I can purchase it here.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara ever! Since, much to my chagrin, it was discontinued by Maybelline, I was very fortunate to find it here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This mascara has become very hard to find in stores. Thank goodness for internet shopping!! I LOVE the comb applicator!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this mascara after reading the rave reviews about it.  I have been using it for about a week now, and am already in love with it.  I must say though, for people that have busy lives and rarely have the time or want to make time to curl your lashes, apply multiple coats, etc. to get perfect lashes, this mascara is even more invaluable.  I typically only need one coat, maybe a tiny bit more on the outer edges if its date night.  But for me, it has taken the need for an eyelash curler away, and I still feel well put together.  I only wish Maybelline would keep something that actually pleases most people...</li>
    <li> I love this product because of the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; instead of the brush on the end.  Great service and wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful.  If Maybelline has discontinued it, I can see why: I&#x27;ve not had such racoon eyes since I was in High School 40 years ago.  The comb pushes so much mascara on my lashes I either have to wipe off the excess somehow or wipe most of it off the comb before I begin.  I&#x27;ve had this in my makeup drawer for several months, thinking I&#x27;d try it again...maybe I was just having a bad day...but nope, it&#x27;s still the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have ordered from this seller many times and always received prompt, perfect service. I have ordered cosmetics from Maybelline, which have always been delivered in fantastic time, completely perfect. They are reliable and on-time.</li>
    <li> I am so upset that they have stopped selling this mascara in stores. This will be my 3rd time reordering the 2-pack. I have not found a mascara that gives me long lashes like this one. You can really use the comb to style your eyelashes how you like. I have short lashes, and after applying this , the difference is incredible! Fast, reliable shipping!</li>
    <li> This mascara is the only thing I use for my lashes. With this mascara I get extra long, unclummped eyelashes. Was upset when they stopped selling this in stores, but so happy its on Amazon!</li>
    <li> wonderful product- i was a little sceptical, but i&#x27;m glad i tried it. the magic is in the application wand (comb). wish i could get it locally!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. Why is it that when you find a product you really love that they discontinue it?  Thank goodness for Amazon!  I can continue to use my favorite product by purchasing it right here on Amazon!  I&#x27;ve ordered this product at least a half a dozen times since they discontinued it!  I love the comb instead of the brush.  My lashes look longer, the mascara stays on all day and there&#x27;s no clumping.  Easily one of my favorite beauty products!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and can&#x27;t find anymore in stores.  I use it with 2 other of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find this mascara again, this is my absolute favorite mascara and was so upset when maybelline discontinued it.  I have tried countless other mascaras but none come close to the lash stylist&#x27;s comb it is not only my favorite but my 14 year old daughter loves it too. We are both so happy to have found it on Amazon, thank you amazon for having this product, you have made our day. I have stocked up for now and will be ordering again! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I just started wearing this mascara a few days ago and I have to agree with other reviewers. It goes on very smoothly and evenly and wears very well. It would be interesting to find out why Maybelline doesn&#x27;t sell this in stores any longer but I guess thats the way it goes. The newer flashier packaged mascaras getting shelf space aren&#x27;t necessarily better products. When I wore this mascara for the first time I was on a trip to NYC and my lashes looked better than ever. After a full day of walking on windy streets, riding subways and taxis and just being on the go till 1:00 a.m. my lashes still looked fresh and I didn&#x27;t have dark smears under my eyes. When I washed my face it was easy to remove and I didn&#x27;t lose lashes trying to scrub it off. I will use this till it isn&#x27;t available any longer.</li>
    <li> Wanted to say Thanks! I received my product as ordered, very quickly and couldn&#x27;t be more happy. I would recommend this site to everyone.......</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the wand on this, it is not the \\&quot;usual\\&quot; wand. It has a flat side and then a side that acts like a comb. For me, I prefer the standard mascara brush wand to this type, but I am sure some people prefer this type of wand so I guess it is just a preference thing. The mascara itself is fine. Will probably use a wand from one of my other Maybelline mascaras that should solve the wand issue.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever. Don&#x27;t know why they discontinued it. Makes my lashes really long, with no clumping. I was afraid this would be dried out since it&#x27;s a discontinued product and I didn&#x27;t know how long it had been sitting around, but it was fine.</li>
    <li> I found this item in Amazon and I was delighted since trying everywhere was impossible.  I even got into the Maybelline webside and they do not have but they suggested the new one that came after that is a piece of trash.  I can not understand why they discontinue a perfectly good and great product to replace it with something that is worthless.  I bought the new one since I ran out of the one that I have and I do not like it at all.  Since Amazon has it (please Amazon keep it online and I promise I will buy it from you) I bought some and I will buy more for the near future.</li>
    <li> So sad Maybelline discontinued production of this mascara. This was the only mascara with a comb rather than brush I could find. No brush can ever replicate the lashes that this comb mascara could.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I use! It extends my lashes like no other can. So sad they discontinued it :(</li>
    <li> This mascara was exactly what I was hoping for and it delivered! I will be ordering more and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I hope they can always get Lash Stylist, it&#x27;s the only mascara I will ever use. I recommend them Highly</li>
    <li> this product is amazing, i got so many compliments, my friends also started ordering this mascara from amazon since it&#x27;s not available in the market.</li>
    <li> Thank you for shipping my mascara so fast.  I love this product and cannot find it in the stores.  Thanks again</li>
    <li> Apparently this mascara is no longer on the market, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and for a very god price (in spite of paying postage). I ordered several and will check to see if it is still available and order more.    it&#x27;s been my favorite for years and the only mascara that works for me in the non-clumping department.    Five stars!!</li>
    <li> my second time ordering this...  i love the comb-style applicator.  with my first order the mascara was very wet and juicy and i had a little trouble with clumps.  BUT that could be because i might have ordered waterproof (and this time it was not).   anyway, the second time i ordered a 2-pk to save money, but it seems very dry and pasty compared to the first one.  i remember reading in some of the reviews that this is a product that is no longer manufactured, so it could be  old????  i don&#x27;t know... just guessing.  i kept using it anyway, and  since it was drier i didn&#x27;t have issues with clumps that i had before, so it was fine i guess.  but don&#x27;t think i will order it again.  bummer because i really liked that comb-style wand.  :0(</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara and I think maybelline discontinued it so I am happy to find it on amazon.com!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I have light fine lashes. The comb on the wand works perfect. I will order more.</li>
    <li> This stuf is the best mascara that money can buy. It&#x27;s really too bad that they discontinued it!  I bought 12 tubes here on Amazon. haha, my husband thinks I am insane</li>
    <li> This product was so OLD OLD would not buy again and would not recommend it to anyone total waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product sucks!!!!! When I got them I was so happy to get them and then I opened it to find that it&#x27;s all dried up I will never order this from this company every again! This is the second time I received this product and it was all dry. Would love to get my money back !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. It goes on easily after a little getting used to. It is different from the brush kind so you have to adjust to it. The great thing is that it STAYS ON! and lengthens and thickens the look of my lashes. It has a tiny comb applicator which separates and coats each lash.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds, none of the work as they claim</li>
    <li> For some reason, any mascara (except one) that I try leaves me with awful raccoon eyes. Cheap, expensive, waterproof....nothing works except Neutrogena weightless volume wax free which is no longer available. Poot!</li>
    <li> I love this Mascara and it has been discontinued from Maybelline so I&#x27;m so happy to have it here on Amazon! I have thin, small lashes and this is the only Mascara that works for me! It makes them appear longer and no clumps!! Hope Amazon keeps selling this product.</li>
    <li> Not like the old comb.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara haven&#x27;t found any other brand like it.</li>
    <li> I recently searched for Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stylist mascara on Amazon and to my delight, there were many for sale.  I was surprised that one mascara tube was going from $45-$60.  As I kept shopping I found deal after deal.  It&#x27;s been 2 years of searching for this particular brand and style of mascara.  When I found the mascara on Amazon, I took advantage of the deals.  I ended up purchasing a total of 4 tubes of Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stylist mascara.  Don&#x27;t want to live without it any time soon.  The mini comb applicator is smooth going on and doesn&#x27;t clump up at all.  I love this product.  You will too.</li>
    <li> The mascara is wonderful but don&#x27;t order from Beauty Brands! Their products are dried out. I purchased two tubes and they were both already completely dried out.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I ever tried! And i tried several ones! It makes lashes look so long. Also, the price is really convenient!</li>
    <li> I just love this mascara, I was so happy to get a three pack of them for this price! Good product came brand new! Would buy again no doubt!</li>
    <li> I have used this Mascara for a few years now and i con&#x27;t seem to find anything that is as good .&lt;br /&gt;So i will continue with this until they stop selling it .</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me. Too thin. Dried out too quickly. It added nothing to my lashes and I have lashes to work with. I had to apply several coats before I saw a little difference.  By the time the coats were on, it was clumpy...not a good one, at least for me.</li>
    <li> this mascara is amazing</li>
    <li> both mascaras were very dried out, (ive used this kind before and can tell the difference) and Im guessing they were extremely old because everytime i used them they cumbled off and gave me stys every other time i wore them.  ***This is due to the seller because I loved this brush and never had a problem with it when purchased fresh at the store</li>
    <li> No. Leaves clumps and doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> This was my FAVORITE Mascara of all time but this have been DISCONTINUED for 5 YEARS...Yes, 5 years!!!&lt;br /&gt;So whatever is still sold here or circulating somewhere else is NOT FRESH it&#x27;s 5 years old in the TUBE, and sold in ridiculous prices. So it&#x27;s a big health risk buying it because we don&#x27;t know how fresh it is even in unopened packaging.&lt;br /&gt;For all we know it could be all dried up and growing bacteria inside the tube then we ladies apply it on our lashes.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to see this product on Amazon. I used to use this years ago and was very disappointed when I could not find it anymore. Well, this is definitely not the same product. The comb or the mascara. When I pulled out the comb, it was not even really a comb. It looked like perhaps it had BEEN a comb at one point but whatever happened, all the teeth were worn off down to the &amp;#34;nubs&amp;#34;. In other words, it did not even apply the mascara properly. You might as well have been using a stick. Awful! SO disappointed and a waste of money. This product is not as advertised.</li>
    <li> Alright honestly, why? I can only assume it must be over a patent dispute otherwise it just doesn&#x27;t make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is AWESOME!!! This is by far the most superior product I&#x27;ve ever used on my lashes.  It makes my lashes look fake (in a good way), people always ask if I&#x27;m wearing falsies, lol.  No but seriously, it makes your lashes look thick and loooong!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually what I do to exaggerate the length is either put mascara as soon as I get out of the shower (with lashes wet) or I wet the wand a little.  Yes, it dilutes the product a bit but trust me, your lashes will get longer with each stroke.  Another thing I like to do is just wash off the wand and put it in a different company&#x27;s mascara if I like the formula (the top has to fit, obviously).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is THE BEST applicator you&#x27;ll find out there right now so snap it up if you can!  Do it!!  DO IT NOW!!  ;)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and I was so upset when Maybelline discontinued it in the stores.  The comb deposits just the right amount of rich, dark mascara, and then you can comb through again to define lashes.  No clumps, and the comb really curls the lashes well.  I just wish it was still in production and available in stores.</li>
