    <li> You&#x27;ll get quick volume and lengthening from this incredibly inexpensive mascara without having to put on a dozen coats to see it, like some other brands. I have sensitive skin but it&#x27;s never bothered me at all; I&#x27;ve even watched sad movies in it and it doesn&#x27;t run. :-) Seems to come off about as easily (L&#x27;Oreal makes a good eye-makeup remover, too!) as other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY brands/mascaras out there...this is my favorite. It gives good volume and length. Good price and the quality is awesome!!! Highly recommend it. Why spend so much money on other famous brand, when this one does what it suppose to!</li>
    <li> This mascara came in a wand case that had a miniscule crack in it, which I didn&#x27;t notice until it leaked out and got all over my medicine cabinet. It created a terrible mess that was very difficult and time consuming to clean up. This wasn&#x27;t a shipping packaging issue--the box arrived safely and the wand was sealed in plastic, so it was the product case/wand that must have been defective. In all the years I&#x27;ve used mascara, I&#x27;ve never had that happen before, so I&#x27;m going to go back to the brands I&#x27;ve used in the past. Yuck.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s because I have thinner eyelashes. I&#x27;m not sure. This mascara was in beautiful packaging but for myself, it didn&#x27;t work. I found with this brand it leaked all over my face while putting it on. I don&#x27;t have this experience with most mascaras. The first layer did nothing but the second layer added large clumps to my lashes. Irritating.</li>
    <li> Having answered the questions about the product above - I&#x27;m not sure I have more to add. It is a good product. I&#x27;m sometimes leary about paying extra just for the &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;. I typically have a ton of problems with clumping. I think it&#x27;s the way my eyelashes are formed - I swear I have a cowlick on one of my lids. Anyway, this mascara lived up to it&#x27;s reputation. I just hate paying for brand names (always more expensive).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blond and prefer the Black Brown, which is sometimes hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable to wear and easy to get off.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my mascara purchase. The color it what I wanted, I like black-brown. It goes on easy and smooth, there is no clumping. It lasts all day and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have usually liked Loreal mascaras in the past, but this one is not so great. When first applied it does look pretty good on, but as the day goes on I notice smudges all over my lower eye area. I&#x27;ve never had that happen w/ any other mascara except this one. I have to constantly look to make sure that my eyes is not smudging! Once this bottle is done I&#x27;m purchasing another type b/c I&#x27;m not happy w/ this one at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is a little glopy going on, but if you clean off the brush with a tissue first it actually goes on well and looks amazing...at first.  It smudges badly after a few hours so might be OK to wear out but not able to last the day at the office.</li>
    <li> Hard to get color. No longer make it. Sad day when they stopped making.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous mascara is what I expected and like it very much.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product was old but when it arrived it was dry, clumpy and gross. Terrible. Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> I have a thing for L&#x27;Oreal products. They are just the best. This mascara is no exception. What I love about it is it comes off easily with a makeup wipe but it doesn&#x27;t run if you cry. Which I do a lot because I am a very sensitive person. It&#x27;s true. As anyone. So if you cry when you laugh, cry when you&#x27;re mad, cry when you&#x27;re sad, cry when you&#x27;re touched, or just have dry eyes like me that water all the time... and you don&#x27;t like waterproof mascaras, this is the mascara for you.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.  Like the brush and texture.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected only for a better price than the cosmetic counter, I&#x27;ll order more when I need to</li>
    <li> Love how it applies. It applies not too thick and not too thin. Perfect for small eyelashes like mine. :)</li>
    <li> My local store doesn&#x27;t always have this is stock, so I&#x27;m glad to be able to get something I know I like.</li>
    <li> my hub bought this for me,and im making comment thru his account.. DO NOT BUY THIS! i thought the description is true! but it smudge! just a couple of hours! when i tried wipping my eyes,to clear it off from some dirt,i see my hangky,dark! and im not even sweating! how much more if i did?! was trying to return this,but thru the policy they say if i return this,i should pay for the shipping! OH GOSH! rip off for something that&#x27;s a complete waste!</li>
    <li> This will be my Mascara from now on.  I don&#x27;t use much makeup, just enough to highlight my good features while trying to stay natural.  This mascara highlights my eyes and really makes them stand out without.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara over every single one I&#x27;ve ever used. I used to get it at Walmart and they stopped carrying it. I was ecstatic when I found it on Amazon,  it&#x27;s good for volume plus length which I need because I have long lashes. A must buy!</li>
    <li> Suppose to not smudge, but it does.  Suppose to come off easily, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, would return if I could.</li>
    <li> eyes burn. did not make lashes look longer.</li>
