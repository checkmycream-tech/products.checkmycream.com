### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Win!</li>
      <li>They are totaly cute and fit me perfectly.</li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>It also keeps my nose and chin warm.  </li>
      <li>It fits excellently and is very soft.</li>
      <li>The good:  Comfortable protection that fits snuggly to the face.  </li>
      <li>Although these are very light weight, they fit snugly, thanks to the ear loops, and warm the air wonderfully before it hits my lungs.  </li>
      <li>They fit snuggly, and stretch out just a bit - kind of like a new pair of jeans, but snug is good, because then you get a good warm seal.</li>
      <li>I love having them and I will order some more</li>
      <li>It makes me look like a cute serial killer.</li>
      <li>However, it is definitely better than nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I could not be more pleased with these.  </li>
      <li>I have bought more for friends.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable, washable, and the ear pieces hold even on my spouses huge, huge, huge head.  </li>
      <li>It is a simple, but great design.</li>
      <li>The packaging is in Chinese, but these would be great for a Korean styled mouth mask.</li>
      <li>These should fit women perfectly, or men with small heads.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>These were exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>This is soft and easy to put away.  </li>
      <li>This delivered very fast.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
      <li>problem with most of them is that they have a metal nose bridge, which does not survive being washed and dried on a regular basis without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more of these.</li>
      <li>Very breathable.</li>
      <li>As a pet groomer, I have tried many masks to cut down on the dander and hair intake into my lungs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wear a Large size hat and it can hurt the ears in a short period of time.  </li>
      <li>One caveat - these aren&#x27;t meant to last a lifetime, but they are well made for at least a season&#x27;t use - or more if cared for - and they are very well priced.</li>
      <li>Quality item that has withstood the D.C. winter thus far.  </li>
      <li>A little large for my face but not bad enough to replace</li>
      <li>Whatever you use, you will get a wet spot, but these deal with it pretty well.</li>
      <li>They are well made and higher quality than I expected...</li>
      <li>Is thick and comfortable and also spacious.</li>
      <li>I would recommend these to anyone who has any kind of lung issue or is just sensitive to cold air.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good when you have bad whether I liket</li>

<li> They are lined with an absorbent layer and it does pretty well with the moisture that inevitably builds up anytime you shield your mouth in cold weather.</li>

<li> Useless product.</li>
<li> /&gt;So, this winter it&#x27;s been really cold, and his Dr. told him to avoid that cold air on the lungs, so I popped on the internet, and searched, and searched, and voila - here they were.</li>

    <li> Works great! I am a Contractor and we work in all phases of construction. This is soft and easy to put away.  I wear it when cutting any type of fine dust.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to a friends going to China this summer. She will use hers for smog in places like Shanghai but I currently use my if I&#x27;m working with strong cleaners or if I&#x27;m sick and don&#x27;t want to infect others. It fits excellently and is very soft. Only problem is, you might have a little trouble breathing if its really hot where you&#x27;re using it.</li>
    <li> I could not be more pleased with these.  I live in Texas and we just had a couple of cold fronts come through.  This wouldn&#x27;t be an issue except I have COPD and am on oxygen 24/7.  I have to be very careful not to breathe in cold air.  Although these are very light weight, they fit snugly, thanks to the ear loops, and warm the air wonderfully before it hits my lungs.  It also keeps my nose and chin warm.  It is incredibly soft and there is nothing about it that is irritating.  If I put my glasses over it on my nose, my glasses don&#x27;t even fog. I would recommend these to anyone who has any kind of lung issue or is just sensitive to cold air.</li>
    <li> It makes me look like a cute serial killer.</li>
    <li> This delivered very fast. Is thick and comfortable and also spacious. A little large for my face but not bad enough to replace</li>

I actually added some elastic to remedy this, and unless you have a small head (It&#x27;s made in Asia, likely for the average Asian) you might need to do the same.</li>
    <li> I wear mine on airplanes, once I&#x27;m in an seated of course.  I believe it has kept me from getting a cold, which unfortunately is common after I fly.  I have bought more for friends.  They are well made.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dad, and got myself a pair as well. He grew up in northern Canada, and is well aware of the danger of very cold air and the lungs. [He told me of the day he walked to school one year when it was -60F, with not wind at least, and every inch of skin was covered. At least it wasn&#x27;t uphill and through deep snow. LOL]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this winter it&#x27;s been really cold, and his Dr. told him to avoid that cold air on the lungs, so I popped on the internet, and searched, and searched, and voila - here they were.

They are lined with an absorbent layer and it does pretty well with the moisture that inevitably builds up anytime you shield your mouth in cold weather. Whatever you use, you will get a wet spot, but these deal with it pretty well. And they do come in a pair, so you can dry one, while you wear the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came well packed all of the way from Hong Kong, and I like that. I&#x27;m aware that masks are worn in various parts of China (mainland, and other) for both cold protection, and pollution protection. The experience with design and use shows. One caveat - these aren&#x27;t meant to last a lifetime, but they are well made for at least a season&#x27;t use - or more if cared for - and they are very well priced. I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Too small for my head. These should fit women perfectly, or men with small heads.</li>
    <li> I love having them and I will order some more</li>
    <li> They are well made and higher quality than I expected...</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for! They are totaly cute and fit me perfectly. Very breathable. The packaging is in Chinese, but these would be great for a Korean styled mouth mask.</li>
    <li> I build cabinet and am always wearing a dusk mask. This mask would not be that bad if there was a metal piece for the nose area. There is no contact, therefore it will not block the dust. Useless product.</li>
    <li> Fits well and doesnt irritate my ears</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good when you have bad whether I liket</li>
    <li> Quality item that has withstood the D.C. winter thus far.  Comfortable, washable, and the ear pieces hold even on my spouses huge, huge, huge head.  Win!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Nice material-- doesn&#x27;t make my face itchy or irritated. I wear it out on cold days outside to keep warm.</li>
