      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>This product smells great, doesn&#x27;t bother my child&#x27;s eyes, and is organic.  </li>
      <li>The smell is great and the baby likes the foam.</li>
      <li>great brand and product</li>
      <li>with all the deceptive marketing strategies going on with the yes products I would not feel safe using them on a baby or myself!!</li>
      <li>This product is great as a body wash, not as good as a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This is good for use for those who wash their hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This was too drying for my hair but did a good job as a body and hand wash.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m grateful to find it at Amazon at a good price point.  </li>
      <li>I love that this soap is a foam with a pump!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Say yes to baby carrots is our favorite!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Smells good, easy to dose an wash out!</li>
      <li>To Carrots products, it&#x27;s just a bit more mild which is perfect for a baby anyways.</li>
      <li>Nice foaming dispenser</li>
      <li>She loved it even better</li>
      <li>nice</li>
      <li>This purchased was well liked and will purchase again.</li>
      <li>I feel that it kind of drys out their skin and hair though.</li>
      <li>I hoped this would have a PLEASANT light fragrance since it is not the \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; version, plus added fragrance is on the ingredients list.</li>
      <li>I have found that foam products work the best for infants and young toddlers.  </li>
      <li>This pump works great, nice, soapy foam and gets my baby clean really quickly.</li>
      <li>(I tend to get a skin reaction when I use anything that has sulfate in it, so I am very glad that this is sulfate free.)</li>
      <li>The pump is easy to use, the soap produces a nice foam, and it has a neutral smell.</li>
      <li>Will keep using this :)&lt;</li>
      <li>I love that this is both a body wash and a shampoo.</li>
      <li>There is an app called &amp;#34;Think Dirty&amp;#34; that rates the safety of the product from 0 to 10 with 0 being the safest and 10 being the most unsafe.</li>
      <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t contain many chemicals.</li>
      <li>just wish it smelled better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Love this toddler soap.</li>
      <li>&quot; they add seems more like a chemical smell to me.</li>
      <li>I love this body was and shampoo  </li>
      <li>Nice, light scent.</li>
      <li>They love being able to put the soap on themselves since it is foamy.</li>
      <li>Love this product and so do my two children ages 1 and 2.</li>
      <li>I would have given a 5 star as I love the shampoo but the bottle is defective....</li>
      <li>and sometimes we use a bit more if the bath dolls need their hair washed too :)</li>
      <li>Nice mild smell, safe for the kids</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also impressed at how long it takes to go through a bottle; I thought we&#x27;d use it up faster than we do.</li>
      <li>Great and not harsh.</li>
      <li>and it spreads easily either way.</li>
      <li>Not too sticky, washes away easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mild and non-irritating.</li>
      <li>Is easy to wash out too.b</li>
      <li>This is very mild and soothing soap.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I found a shampoo/body wash that isn&#x27;t harmful and full of chemicals.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and body wash is clean, clear, rinses pure, and smells wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for bath time and seems to be made of high quality, natural ingredients which is important to me.</li>
      <li>This product made bath time a huge hassle.</li>
      <li>Perfect for a 9 mo old and a 4 year old.  </li>
      <li>Recently available data from an FDA study indicate that retinyl palmitate, when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight, may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions.</li>
      <li>I end up using a lot of it, and it wasn&#x27;t cheap to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It may sound nitpicky but I don&#x27;t want to turn up my nose every time I bathe my son, and</li>
      <li>They changed to a 98% fragrance free formula and I am allergic to it.</li>
      <li>These are good for anyone with sensitive skin or anyone allergic to sulfate in cleaning products.</li>
      <li>Has a good smell, but I personally like the seventh generation for babies better.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Yes to Baby Carrots shampoo/body wash based on the many positive customer reviews and was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>I use this on both my kids (2.5 years and 5 months) and its very easy to use, cleans whole body plus hair.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the clean, my daughter&#x27;s skin is much smoother and no reactions, as we have had with lot sof soaps!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clean well</li>
      <li>Most of the ingredients seem really natural and safe.</li>
      <li>That IS clean.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad we have a better all natural alternative.</li>
      <li>This is especially good for me since I have sensitive skin and like to wash my hair daily.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is wonderful in that it creates a foam as it dispenses so you really use very little each bath (we use probably more than we need to at four to five pumps for hair and body</li>
      <li>The foaming is nice, and it leaves his skin &amp; hair soft, but wont purchase again.</li>
      <li>I kind of like a soft scent on him after a bath.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with it, but I just can&#x27;t summon much enthusiasm for it.</li>
      <li>Cleans well, no smell, all natural, no tears, foaming dispenser gives nice suds.</li>
      <li>Has a nice, natural scent.</li>
      <li>As a first time parent, I was looking for something that was easy to use, and also did not get in my baby&#x27;s eyes.</li>
      <li>I loved this product so much that I bought myself the adult version!</li>
      <li>I have been using this for 17 months, and just stocked up on some more as we are expecting a new baby in April!</li>
      <li>We might need to switch to a stronger wash when he gets older and gets into more dirt.</li>
      <li>The plus is this is super foam where the California baby stuff is super runny and watery almost.</li>
      <li>Just stick to Doctor Bronnors organic baby mild Castile soap.</li>
      <li>and I am happy that I found it online for much cheaper then the big box store.  </li>
      <li>ESPECIALLY when they try to label it like its so clean and healthy for your child like this company does!</li>
      <li>I do need to add another pump to wash all of me, but that is normal when using most body washes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok doesn&#x27;t lather very much doesn&#x27;t have much fragrance and works ok.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>I used face paint on their arms once and what was used to come off easily with gentle soap and water stayed put with Yes</li>
      <li>The shipping and packaging were perfect, and I think this bottle will also last a long time</li>
      <li>Great shampoo for little ones.  </li>
      <li>my 5 week old boy is enjoying his bath now.</li>
      <li>I then tried the Aveeno Baby moisturizing wash and shampoo, which worked slightly better than the Johnson&#x27;s, but his skin didn&#x27;t clear up and it did NOTHING for his eczema.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it is definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bathtime is fun.</li>
      <li>The California baby stuff is wonderful but also way more expensive!  </li>
      <li>It dries their skin even if I put lotion on them right after their bath.</li>
      <li>The product has a light scent and seems pretty gentle.</li>
      <li>I need to pump a lot of it in order for it to foam in my kids&#x27; hair and it still doesn&#x27;t clean very well.</li>
      <li>It does not lather that much in the hair, but my hair feels clean after use.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hoped this would have a PLEASANT light fragrance since it is not the \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; version, plus added fragrance is on the ingredients list. It also lists carrots and melon extracts so I thought perhaps it may smell like that. However, there isn&#x27;t much of any scent, except a weird one that is hard to describe. It&#x27;s a LOT like the \\&quot;Johnson &amp; Johnson Naturals\\&quot; line (which I didn&#x27;t like). It may sound nitpicky but I don&#x27;t want to turn up my nose every time I bathe my son, and I kind of like a soft scent on him after a bath. I like that this has natural ingredients but the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; they add seems more like a chemical smell to me. I really wondered if I had mistakenly been sent the fragrance-free version. The foaming is nice, and it leaves his skin &amp; hair soft, but wont purchase again. I ended up going with the Seventh Generation Baby Wash gel (smells a bit citrusy.) They also have a foaming version.</li>
    <li> Love this toddler soap. Not too sticky, washes away easily. Nice, light scent.</li>
    <li> Has a nice, natural scent. Does not dry out her skin. Cleans without irritating her sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a foaming product with little lathering capabilities. Not great for thick hair, only OK as a body wash. Normally I love Yes To products, so this one is definitely an anomaly.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a baby wash that was natural and didn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell.  This is the ticket.  Cleans well, no smell, all natural, no tears, foaming dispenser gives nice suds.</li>
    <li> Love this product and so do my two children ages 1 and 2. They love being able to put the soap on themselves since it is foamy.</li>
    <li> As a first time parent, I was looking for something that was easy to use, and also did not get in my baby&#x27;s eyes. I have found that foam products work the best for infants and young toddlers.  This product smells great, doesn&#x27;t bother my child&#x27;s eyes, and is organic.  Don&#x27;t let the cost scare you.  The bottle lasts awhile.  I have been using this for 17 months, and just stocked up on some more as we are expecting a new baby in April!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Does the job but I need to use conditioner afterwards as it does not leave my son&#x27;s hair soft enough; also does not detangle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult looking for gentle toiletries so often use baby products. This was too drying for my hair but did a good job as a body and hand wash. One bottle lasted about 6 weeks (daily use) for me so it was a decent deal. I&#x27;d buy this again for trips as hotel soaps are too harsh and the bottle doesnt look like it would leak. This is superior to other more expensive baby washes which often contain SLS/pthalates/paraben/amines/triclosan.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Yes to Baby Carrots shampoo/body wash based on the many positive customer reviews and was not disappointed! Our five-month-old grandson had several dry patches that cleared up beautifully once we started using it for his bath. I would definitely recommend Yes to Baby Carrots!</li>
    <li> I love this body was and shampoo  it is so gentle. And smells great</li>
    <li> This is not a clean product and not safe for your baby or toddler. There is an app called &amp;#34;Think Dirty&amp;#34; that rates the safety of the product from 0 to 10 with 0 being the safest and 10 being the most unsafe. This product was a 9. I am a first time mom of a 6 month old and it makes me so mad to constantly be discovering all of these terrible ingredients in my babies products! ESPECIALLY when they try to label it like its so clean and healthy for your child like this company does! Just stick to Doctor Bronnors organic baby mild Castile soap. That IS clean. Was rated a 0 (safest) on the Think Dirty app and I can read and understand all of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I like this for washing my hair and body with the same product.  I like the smell and that it lathers well.  This is especially good for me since I have sensitive skin and like to wash my hair daily.  (I tend to get a skin reaction when I use anything that has sulfate in it, so I am very glad that this is sulfate free.) This cleans my hair and skin well.  My skin does not feel dry after washing with this body wash.  I do not need to use a moisturizer after using it as a body wash.  I imagine that this is because it has vitamin E in it.  It does not lather that much in the hair, but my hair feels clean after use.  This is good for use for those who wash their hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump for this product as I use a long handle applicator for washing my body, so I am able to apply the body wash to the applicator from the pump.  I do need to add another pump to wash all of me, but that is normal when using most body washes anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finding that I like using Yes to brand of personal care products.  These are good for anyone with sensitive skin or anyone allergic to sulfate in cleaning products.</li>
    <li> This soap is great, it is delicate for the most sensitive skin, and it lasts forever.  I was afraid with the size (and the amount we use) that it was going to be gone in a week, but the bottle keeps going and going. The smell is great and the baby likes the foam. This is our go-to bath soap.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if they changed the recipe, but I have had this on subscribe and save for 4yrs, my most recent delivery has been horrible. I used it on my back and had to slather lotion immediately out of the shower. Later that week used it on my little guy as I always do--on his hair and right after the shower his face was brutally dry (ran down on his face while shampooing his head). It has been a week now and still all scaled up from the soap. :( No longer my go to soap.</li>
    <li> Easy-foaming, doesn&#x27;t irritate my toddler&#x27;s eyes, and lasts a while (we&#x27;ve had this for months).  My son loves using it to wash his face, hair and body.  It&#x27;s not super cleaning, but not super drying either, so it&#x27;s great for a toddler.  We might need to switch to a stronger wash when he gets older and gets into more dirt.</li>
    <li> No lather at all and the suds made my hair feel dry.  I wanted to like it but it just wasnt for me.</li>
    <li> I just wrote a review for their bubble bath with the same title - used it here because it it absolutely applicable.  This shampoo and body wash is clean, clear, rinses pure, and smells wonderful.  The packaging is wonderful in that it creates a foam as it dispenses so you really use very little each bath (we use probably more than we need to at four to five pumps for hair and body but it&#x27;s so much fun to lather my little one with this :) and sometimes we use a bit more if the bath dolls need their hair washed too :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this baby wash- much more than other natural washes. I was sad when we ran out and I had to go through a whole  bottle of a different brand before getting more of this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to find soap/shampoo products without coconut by-products but this is an idea product.  It&#x27;s hard to find in local stores so I&#x27;m grateful to find it at Amazon at a good price point.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I would have given a 5 star as I love the shampoo but the bottle is defective....I have to open the cap and pour it out every time I bathe my baby....its not what I bargained for....</li>
    <li> The product has a light scent and seems pretty gentle. The bottle is great and foams up well. Most of the ingredients seem really natural and safe. Unfortunately, the product contains RETINYL PALMITATE. Although the ingredient is regarded as safe by the FDA and is a common food and cosmetic additive, the Environmental Working Group points to retinyl palmitate as a developmental and reproductive toxin which has been connected with cancer in animal studies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When exposed to UV light, retinol compounds break down and produce toxic free radicals that can damage DNA and cause gene mutations, a precursor to cancer. Recently available data from an FDA study indicate that retinyl palmitate, when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight, may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions. FDA also raised a concern that extensive, daily skin application of vitamin A creams may build up in the woman&#x27;s body. A high enough level of Vitamin A that may be toxic to the developing fetus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one hand, I figure the baby isn&#x27;t getting a whole lot of the retinyl palmitate, and there are worse baby shampoos out there (Yes to Carrots scores a 3 out of 8 on the ewg site). On the other hand, if you&#x27;re going to spend this much for a healthy product for your child, I&#x27;d suggest going with a different brand, such as Loving Naturals, Earth Mama Angel Baby, or California Baby (which all score a 0). Children and fetuses are more sensitive to environmental toxins, so I prefer to be on the safe side and avoid products with this ingredient in the future.</li>
    <li> I found this to be very similar to Johnson &amp; Johnson naturals baby wash, smells the same. We like the smell and feel of CA baby body wash and shampoos. Guess it does the job. I feel that it kind of drys out their skin and hair though. Won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This soap did not meet my expectations at all. It didn&#x27;t work very well for a shampoo on my baby since she has a full head of hair and once it was put on a wash cloth it didn&#x27;t lather. It wasn&#x27;t until I read the back of the label that I was truly I unsatisfied due to the warning about long exposure causin urinary tract problems. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural baby wash, don&#x27;t go with this one, I know I&#x27;ll be returning to the Burt&#x27;s Bees line of products.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo out there.&lt;br /&gt;Our baby has very sensitive skin and we had to try many different ones. Say yes to baby carrots is our favorite! Smells good, easy to dose an wash out!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for little ones.  Is a foam so they don&#x27;t get it in their eyes like other shampoos. Is easy to wash out too.b just wish it smelled better. Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t contain many chemicals. We are trying to get away from as many as possible w our little ones.</li>
    <li> did not come with safety seal! cant use this on my children...</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rate this so well for shampoo, it leaves the hair stripped of all the oils and is damaging. My son has sensitive skin and this made his eczema much worse. My daughter has normal skin and this never gave her any issue but maybe a little extra dryness. For my son I have switched to only using conditioner in his hair and on his body we use Jason kids conditioner. No more&amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; issues which were probably just an allergic reaction to something or extra sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very good product my 5 week old boy is enjoying his bath now. Will keep using this :)&lt;br /&gt;We used J&amp;J but his skin got reactions and became scaly. This is very mild and soothing soap. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> This works well for our kiddo and he likes that it&#x27;s foamy coming out of the bottle.  I&#x27;m also impressed at how long it takes to go through a bottle; I thought we&#x27;d use it up faster than we do.</li>
    <li> The product goes a long way in that it lasts a long time, and I&#x27;m happy that it can be used as both a body wash and shampoo, but it&#x27;s particularly drying to both skin and hair. I won&#x27;t be buying it again for my toddler.</li>
    <li> Been washing my children with this for almost 5 years. Works great.</li>
    <li> Yes to Baby Carrots has the same scent as all of the other Yes To Carrots products, it&#x27;s just a bit more mild which is perfect for a baby anyways. This pump works great, nice, soapy foam and gets my baby clean really quickly. I use the foam on either a shower pouf or a washcloth and it spreads easily either way. The shipping and packaging were perfect, and I think this bottle will also last a long time so it is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product, but the package needs work. The dispenser is hard to use at best because it is so stubby, and after a while the spring wears out, so dispenser doesn&#x27;t pop back out of the bottle, which means you need two hands to use it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a 9 mo old and a 4 year old.  No tears ever.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the clean, my daughter&#x27;s skin is much smoother and no reactions, as we have had with lot sof soaps!</li>
    <li> Great and not harsh. Was lookinh for something without coconut and soy and this was what I found</li>
    <li> My son had HORRENDOUS cradle cap, and he also had dry scaly patches of skin as well as eczema (poor baby). I tried all of the Johnson&#x27;s products, but my pediatrician told me that Johnson&#x27;s dries out a baby&#x27;s skin and also uses fragrences which could contribute to his skin problems. I then tried the Aveeno Baby moisturizing wash and shampoo, which worked slightly better than the Johnson&#x27;s, but his skin didn&#x27;t clear up and it did NOTHING for his eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a coupon for the Yes to Baby Carrots shampoo &amp; wash so I tried it.. and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!! His cradle cap has been virtually obliterated and there is hardly any sign of it left! His skin isn&#x27;t nearly as dry and I no longer have to completely slather him with lotion after a bath. This wash combined with [[ASIN:B0067JF8CI Neosporin Eczema Essentials Daily Moisturizing Cream, 6 Ounce]] has almost completely cleared up his eczema. The difference in his skin and hair is night and day once I switched to this shampoo and wash. It also leaves his hair very very soft and not greasy at all. I loved this product so much that I bought myself the adult version!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on 2 of my children and it has never irritated their skin, even as newborns.</li>
    <li> I love that this soap is a foam with a pump!  It makes baths so much easier because I can get the soap with one hand...don&#x27;t have to lather up and then pick up a wet baby with one soapy hand!  Also, seems to be easier to control the lather and not get int he little one&#x27;s eyes.  Have been using this soap since he was a newborn and still have never had to use body lotion on him at all.  Does not dry out his skin or make him greasy.  This is the only soap we use and he is now almost a year old!  Love it!</li>
    <li> great brand and product</li>
    <li> Nice mild smell, safe for the kids, I can trust it going on their bodies.  Nice foaming dispenser</li>
    <li> I use this on both my kids (2.5 years and 5 months) and its very easy to use, cleans whole body plus hair. Perfect for bath time and seems to be made of high quality, natural ingredients which is important to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this kids shampoo &amp; body wash combo to streamline bathtime. One product to 1) make some bubbles under the running water, 2) shampoo and 3) body wash. This product accomplishes it. It is also paraben- and sulfate-free, like the other &amp;#34;yes to&amp;#34; hair products I&#x27;ve been using. It has a mild, unobtrusive scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not very used to the foam pump bottles. It seems like it takes about four pumps to rub through my daughters&#x27; hair. The plastic cap has been adopted as a bath toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with it, but I just can&#x27;t summon much enthusiasm for it. I am not sure why, but it could be because I have such lovely memories of sniffing baby hair that smells like the Johnson baby shampoo, and nothing else can quite measure up to that legacy. *sigh*...still, four stars for a satisfactory product.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my sister for her daughter she could not find it in her local. She loved it even better my niece loves it says her hair is soft her skin doesn&#x27;t inch. This purchased was well liked and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this for my 2 and 4 year olds. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t contain the nasty ingredients that other kids&#x27; shampoos contain. Washes and rinses well. Doesn&#x27;t leave the kids hair greasy either. I use it with the Yes to Carrots conditioner. I also use the Yes to Carrots hair line for myself. I love it!</li>
    <li> We ran out of the organic stuff I normally get for my kids (trough subscribe and save) and picked up this one at the drug store. This product made bath time a huge hassle. I need to pump a lot of it in order for it to foam in my kids&#x27; hair and it still doesn&#x27;t clean very well. Moreover, the pump gets stuck so I have to pull it back up after I press it which drives me nuts. There&#x27;s no foam on the wash cloth either so it feels like I&#x27;m washing the kids with plain water. I end up using a lot of it, and it wasn&#x27;t cheap to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clean well so I have to scrub the kids&#x27;s skin harder if they&#x27;ve been to the playground. I used face paint on their arms once and what was used to come off easily with gentle soap and water stayed put with Yes To and scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;My kids hate it, I hate and I&#x27;m glad we have a better all natural alternative. It dries their skin even if I put lotion on them right after their bath. Even my hands feel dry after bathing my kids with this. I&#x27;m a huge supporter of natural and organic products, especially for kids, but this doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
    <li> It was decent as far as shampoo goes, but it&#x27;s hard to get a good lather with it and it always seems to leave the kids&#x27; hair just a little oily-feeling.</li>
    <li> I ordred this for my toddler and I&#x27;m glad that I found a shampoo/body wash that isn&#x27;t harmful and full of chemicals. The pump is easy to use, the soap produces a nice foam, and it has a neutral smell. I love that this is both a body wash and a shampoo. This is a must have in our household!</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;no tears&lt;br /&gt;smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;natural- whatever that means I don&#x27;t think that word is regulated</li>
    <li> The product itself is terrific.  But this is our fifth bottle and they all fail - the application head that plunges down will eventually stop popping back up completely.  It&#x27;s annoying.  FIX IT, YES TO!</li>
    <li> with all the deceptive marketing strategies going on with the yes products I would not feel safe using them on a baby or myself!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in charge of bath time when I get home from work and this is our soap of choice. The foam is good because I can soap the little wiggle worm up then just let her splash around some before I wipe her down with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bathtime is fun.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok doesn&#x27;t lather very much doesn&#x27;t have much fragrance and works ok.&lt;br /&gt;A little over priced compared to other similar products.</li>
    <li> I was very upset that the picture still shows 100% fragrance free and the description says the same. They changed to a 98% fragrance free formula and I am allergic to it. Bathing my daughter should not involve my skin falling off.</li>
    <li> FYI, the product is not gel it is a foaming wash.  Has a good smell, but I personally like the seventh generation for babies better.</li>
    <li> This item was at a local T store.  They discontinued carrying it in the store and I am happy that I found it online for much cheaper then the big box store.  It is extremely foamy and eye irritation and that is why I would not recommend this for infants-toddlers for hair.  My child had a little hard time at @ 24 months with it irritating his eyes but other than that no other concerns.  During this time period we used the California Baby Super Sensitive Shampoo and body wash for hair shampoo.  The California baby stuff is wonderful but also way more expensive!  Now that he is over three it seems like it doesn&#x27;t faze him as much using this for shampoo and his eyes do not seem irriatated by it.  If money was not an issue I would spend it all on the California Baby line but it is and that is why I ventured out.  The plus is this is super foam where the California baby stuff is super runny and watery almost.</li>
    <li> I have this on auto ship with subscribe and save. I can&#x27;t always find it in the local stores so its nice to get it at my door step every other month and not have to succumb to easily obtainable but less safe products.</li>
    <li> This product is great as a body wash, not as good as a shampoo.  I use it myself so it might work better as a shampoo for babies or small children.  It&#x27;s very mild and non-irritating.</li>
