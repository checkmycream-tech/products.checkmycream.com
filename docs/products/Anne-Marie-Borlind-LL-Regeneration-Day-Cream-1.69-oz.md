<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best I ever used in ages. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> love this product have used it for 25 to 30 years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of skin creams over time.  I tried a sample in a store and thought I would like it, but I don&#x27;t feel any&lt;br /&gt;wonderful results.  even lower cost products did as much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer that leaves skin very soft - using in the morning and at night</li>
    <li> I absolute love the Regeneration milk wash, night cream, astringent, and eye cream. I used this day cream a few times, and because I&#x27;m not used to day creams, maybe it&#x27;s just me. I got pimples using it, so I don&#x27;t use it anymore. Maybe if I lived in a dry climate. Like I said, it&#x27;s probably just me and my face. I absolutely would recommend any of the LL Regeneration products to post-menopausal women looking to tighten their pores and I love the smell. But this cream didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> best stuff ever. Pricey but worth it as it lasts a long time.Been using it for over twenty years and love  it.</li>
    <li> fast ship, exactly as pictured</li>
    <li> Borlind&#x27;s US distributor shot itself in the foot by closing down for a time which led us to discover that we could buy the same products for less on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. It has some sun protection, keeps my skin soft and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to young women, as well as to the older, such as I am.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin very supple and moisturized, not greasy. Also improves the tone and minimizes pores. Totally hooked on all LL Regeneration Line. Recommend without hesitation, you will love this. It really does renew the skin...... if you wear foundation over the day cream, it will look smoother and last longer too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Annemarie Borlind products before and think they&#x27;re one of the best skincare lines on the market. I&#x27;ve tried so many products, and I always come back to Borlind. I like that they&#x27;re a clean product and have to pass Germany&#x27;s strict ingredients rules in order to be sold in the pharmacies of Germany. The LL line is for 30+ year skin types--skin that is showing the first few lines and creases of aging. It&#x27;s a good to stop the formation and further deepening of lines and wrinkles. The LL Day Cream is a great day cream. It is not heavy or greasy and performs a perfect balance of skin toning and moisturizing. It&#x27;s a great base for makeup. It took me a while to get used to wearing it, and I tended to put more on than needed, because it is easily absorbed by the skin. But, less is more with this product. I recommend using the LL Regeneration Blossom Dew Gel before applying the cream. Extends the life of your product and the toner assists with absorption.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this cream several times but this time the cream had separated. When I opened the jar, there was water at the surface and the consistency of the cream was not the same. I am sending it back for a replacement .</li>
    <li> I have dry skin from time to time, and I need a super moisturizing cream.  This is a rich, luxurious cream.  Smells really good!  I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Have been using this crème for 20 years now and I love it.  I have very dry skin and love Annemarie Borlund products in general.</li>
    <li> Saved a significant amount compared to health food store.  Thank you.  Would like to know of any promos or discounts on this product in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best for middle aged skin. Not too heavy but heavy enough to do the trick. Sinks in and leaves your skin hydrated and soft. I know it cost a bit but is worth the price. I live on social security but make sure I plan and have enough to get a jar about every 90 days.</li>
    <li> I have very dry middle aged skin and this so far has been perfect, makeup goes on well after I put the creme on in the am.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  whipped and goes on easily.  I also like the night cream.  Have tried other brands but like this one for the money</li>
    <li> The best day cream ever!! all natural. I have used this for 27 years now. It keeps my skin looking so young!!</li>
    <li> I love these products!!</li>
    <li> The cream arrived in liquid form and and leaked out of the jar and onto the box. I returned it as soon as the post office opened the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon and they are my go to resource - but hey maybe not for skincare . Sorry this transaction was a fail.&lt;br /&gt;Liz</li>
    <li> I love the consistency, and it has almost no fragrance.  Only thing missing is SPF.  That would make it perfect.</li>
    <li> Luck to find a great product that actually works. I have got is what you expected. Expect the best from Borlind.</li>
    <li> This cream is great stuff without any harmful ingredients.  The price form this vendor is excellent.  It is great to find this product for such a great price.</li>
