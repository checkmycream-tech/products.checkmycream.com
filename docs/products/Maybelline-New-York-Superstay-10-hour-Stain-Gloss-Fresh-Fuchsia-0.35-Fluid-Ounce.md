      <li>I really like the color, and it goes on very nicely.  </li>
      <li>color was so beautiful on my lips very nice soft texture and lasted for 10 hours straight .</li>
      <li>*** out of this without getting clumpy so reapplying is fine.</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; is a happy medium between a dye-job and regular lipstick.  </li>
      <li>because it does stain, it just doesn&#x27;t stay even or smooth ...or bright).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty certain this product was just a good idea that didn&#x27;t quite work out.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very light and pretty.</li>
      <li>I own almost every single color and always get nice color pay off</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good product :)</li>
      <li>it was the worth experience I ever had with Maybelline if it was  free return</li>
      <li>fresh and fabulous all day.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have full coverage on the lips</li>
      <li>The colors are very cute when properly put on lips !</li>
      <li>Its a great new color for fall and since its a stain its SUPER low maintenance.</li>
      <li>but it was worth a shot</li>
      <li>I loved it , it was just a liiiittle darker than what I expected.</li>
      <li>Oh, for the old days when I could control my hand better.</li>
      <li>When I first put my new Fresh Fuchsia stain gloss on I was quite pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Even though I have hand tremors, I am able to use it to apply the stain gloss as well as possible.  </li>
      <li>so I am going to order more in various colors.</li>
      <li>my lips are pretty well prepared for harsher lip products when I choose to wear them.  </li>
      <li>Love the color but doesn&#x27;t stay on or last!</li>
      <li>I first heard about this product reading \\&quot;Glamour.\\</li>
      <li>This product sucks lol.</li>
      <li>I bought one of these in a local store and found it to be the best lip stain for color and for being long lasting.</li>
      <li>With that being said, and like with most stain products, you need to let this product dry before you do any talking, eating etc.</li>
      <li>plus it felt really watery</li>
      <li>My experience is that when I find something I really like it will soon disappear.</li>
      <li>guess it would function well enough as a lipstick if you were wearing it in a dim room (like at a bar, show, etc) with a couple of touch-ups through the night, but who wants that when they can put their money towards something better?</li>
      <li>Pretty color but not worth the price for sure.</li>
      <li>considering I have other products in my life that I love at a drug store price.  </li>
      <li>It stays on most of the day and doesn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling like a layer of guck is on them once it&#x27;s worn off like other stains do.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and lasts very long</li>
      <li>the color is pretty sheer but wipes or comes right off</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m realistic enough to know it wasn&#x27;t going to be some super powered product as it claims to be at $8.50 ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;stays vibrant and shiny, yet transparent, and won&#x27;t fade.</li>
      <li>and I find tips from others super helpful to avoid making the same purchasing errors.  </li>
      <li>The application was simple enough and I was pleased with the vibrant pigment, it looked</li>
      <li>my only problem is that it faded really quickly</li>
      <li>The weightless formula glides on wet and smooth, and feels</li>
      <li>I got home, 5 hours after putting the stuff on in the first place, and I noticed the color had lost its original vibrancy and had gotten darker as it had dried up on my mouth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty color with my skin tone</li>
      <li>So much for \\&quot;vibrant color and lasting shine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just make sure you do not have any dry skin on your lips as the dry skin soaks up the color!</li>
      <li>Kind of annoyed</li>
      <li>was either getting paid for the false and undeserving rave or just so happened to have a far better experience.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Apply on bare lips and color will be here to stay!</li>
      <li>The color is a witchy-purple if you apply too much, so be REALLY generous if you want the expected color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not a 10 hr long wear by any means</li>
      <li>It is the first lip stain I have tried that has not left my lips pigmented unevenly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have never had an issue with this specific lip product. I own almost every single color and always get nice color pay off and it doesn&#x27;t smudge on my lips. With that being said, and like with most stain products, you need to let this product dry before you do any talking, eating etc. Along with that, if you use an excessive amount then you will end up with a glossy mess.</li>
    <li> This product sucks lol. Doesn&#x27;t have full coverage on the lips it&#x27;s very sheer. I like it to be fully covered unless it&#x27;s a lip balm stain.</li>
    <li> I love this product and color.  Its a great new color for fall and since its a stain its SUPER low maintenance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best ! The colors are very cute when properly put on lips ! Easy to use and lasts very long</li>
    <li> I first heard about this product reading \\&quot;Glamour.\\&quot;  I was skeptical of their raves since magazines (as much as I love flipping through them) are essentially giant ads.  They get paid for some product placements as well as ad space.  But I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie and had to give it a shot for the price!  Turned out \\&quot;Glamour\\&quot; was either getting paid for the false and undeserving rave or just so happened to have a far better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When I first put my new Fresh Fuchsia stain gloss on I was quite pleased with it.  The application was simple enough and I was pleased with the vibrant pigment, it looked smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However, Maybelline has no business marketing it with 10 hour staying power (I mean, they put it on the tube itself ...it&#x27;s part of the name) and within an hour and a half I was in need of a small touch up as it was fading in random spots on my lips.  Note, I had not had ANY food or a drop to drink while I had it on and it needed some touching up.  Another couple of hours went by and I decided I&#x27;d better check my lips again ...it&#x27;s no fun feeling concerned you&#x27;re the gal with the messed up lipstick mouth (if you&#x27;re reading this review, I bet you know what I&#x27;m talking about). I got home, 5 hours after putting the stuff on in the first place, and I noticed the color had lost its original vibrancy and had gotten darker as it had dried up on my mouth.  So much for \\&quot;vibrant color and lasting shine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I took a blob of Vaseline and a tissue to my mouth because it had dried my mouth up quite a bit (this turned out to be why the color started fading in random spots...dry patches where the color clung).  I wear Rosebud Salve most of the time, so my lips are pretty well prepared for harsher lip products when I choose to wear them.  So, with well moisturized lips to start with and no eating or drinking during the time I had the product on ...it did not hold up *HALF* the time it said it will, or hold up to any of the other claims either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m realistic enough to know it wasn&#x27;t going to be some super powered product as it claims to be at $8.50 ...but it was worth a shot considering I have other products in my life that I love at a drug store price.  No dice with this product.  I took the time to write a review since there weren&#x27;t any on here yet and I find tips from others super helpful to avoid making the same purchasing errors.  However, I am also one of those people, when it comes to beauty products, that often likes to find out for myself. After all, everyone&#x27;s different and might have a different experience.  I&#x27;m pretty certain this product was just a good idea that didn&#x27;t quite work out.  It came out the gate strong and rapidly started to fail on every part of the description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;stays vibrant and shiny, yet transparent, and won&#x27;t fade. The weightless formula glides on wet and smooth, and feels fresh and fabulous all day.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mmm, no. I am STILL putting balm on my lips and drinking water to hydrate them back up again and not wake up with a berry colored stain on my mouth (because it does stain, it just doesn&#x27;t stay even or smooth ...or bright).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it would function well enough as a lipstick if you were wearing it in a dim room (like at a bar, show, etc) with a couple of touch-ups through the night, but who wants that when they can put their money towards something better?</li>
    <li> I really like the color, and it goes on very nicely.  But unfortunately I gave this 3 stars because, the applicator tip broke off and there&#x27;s no way of putting it back on. so now I am out of luck on using the lip stain I just purchased. Kind of annoyed</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STAIN GLOSS ITS THE BEST ONE OUT THERE AND VERY CHEAP! SMELLS GREAT STAYS ON LONG THATS THE GREAT PART BUY THIS PRODUCT IS IS VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these in a local store and found it to be the best lip stain for color and for being long lasting. Then I went onto Amazon and ordered a bunch more. I do not want to ever run out so I am going to order more in various colors. My experience is that when I find something I really like it will soon disappear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color and feels very nice on. It gives my makeup a bit of the glam feeling without going over the top. It however doesn&#x27;t stay on more than a couple of hours so if you are look for something to stay on for several hours this isn&#x27;t it. But that wasn&#x27;t a  concern for me and I love it.</li>
    <li> Applicator piece fell off the wand the second time I used this... making it unusable.</li>
    <li> Love the color but doesn&#x27;t stay on or last! 😾 the color is pretty sheer but wipes or comes right off</li>
    <li> Although this did not have much lasting power, (2 hours at the max!) It is the first lip stain I have tried that has not left my lips pigmented unevenly. I loved it. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> the color phase out within minutes</li>
    <li> Very nice, stay on pretty good, nice colors, smooth. Don&#x27;t have a taste, color and gloss both on one, affordable!</li>
    <li> If you do not like the feel of creamy lipstick, but need color on your lips, this is for you.  Just make sure you do not have any dry skin on your lips as the dry skin soaks up the color!</li>
    <li> I loved it , it was just a liiiittle darker than what I expected. But it&#x27;s still amazing and has a nice smell 😀</li>
    <li> The color is odd. you need to apply a lot to see the color.</li>
    <li> Love this color! Its is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Definitely NOT 10 hour lip stain. It comes off within a couple hours and that&#x27;s IF I don&#x27;t eat or drink anything. Pretty color but not worth the price for sure.</li>
    <li> Love the color and love the staying power of a stain!  No moisture though, so use a lip balm over it, but NOT under it.  Apply on bare lips and color will be here to stay!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s the prettiest purple for my very fair skin. Just a bit of a berry tone. It&#x27;s definitely not a 10 hr long wear by any means but it&#x27;s very light and pretty. The good thing is you can layer the s*** out of this without getting clumpy so reapplying is fine. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> love this color,very pigmented.</li>
    <li> The color is a little off, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t last 10 hours. It lasts like 1-3 then again, I eat/drink a lot over the course of one day. The color is a witchy-purple if you apply too much, so be REALLY generous if you want the expected color. Also, apply a little bit of chap stick before applying this (I recommend Rose Salve) then apply it. Rub your lips together very slowly, and generously viola! I also recommend applying chap stick (or Rose Salve as I recommended before) during the course of your day so it doesn&#x27;t dry out and look bad. Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good product :)</li>
    <li> love it but the applicator falls apart</li>
    <li> this lip stain doesn&#x27;t stain as much as other stains I have used... but it also has a good taste and is not drying either...</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; is a happy medium between a dye-job and regular lipstick.  It has staying power, yet doesn&#x27;t hang around and look weird later on.  You know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the applicator.  Even though I have hand tremors, I am able to use it to apply the stain gloss as well as possible.  Oh, for the old days when I could control my hand better.</li>
    <li> No ten hours for me...less than 5 minutes before this not-so-long-lasting gloss faded away.  I have tried 4 separate times with same results...I put it on and as I put my lips together the gloss goes...within 5 minutes it looks faded with maybe 2/3 of it left - in other words, I look like I need to reapply my lipstick...definitely NOT what I am looking for in a LONG LASTING lip color.</li>
    <li> A+&lt;br /&gt;this color was so beautiful on my lips very nice soft texture and lasted for 10 hours straight . Deff. Buying more from you guys</li>
    <li> this stuff stays on 10 mins not ten hours</li>
    <li> This is the perfect lipstick for me.  It stays on most of the day and doesn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling like a layer of guck is on them once it&#x27;s worn off like other stains do.  It&#x27;s such a pretty color with my skin tone so I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
    <li> it was the worth experience I ever had with Maybelline if it was  free return I was returning the day I got. didn&#x27;t stay even a minute on my lip how you could advertise such this product as you say is Superstay 10 hour. I am really upset and mad about your product. I have to order different product that I alway order with Maybelline</li>
    <li> I like the color my only problem is that it faded really quickly you had to keep reapplying it, no way it would last 10hrs plus it felt really watery im not sure if its supposed to be like that.</li>
    <li> The color if the lip stain is great. I have tried many colors and they are all beautiful. However, there is no way the color lasts 10 hrs. It might last one hr.</li>
