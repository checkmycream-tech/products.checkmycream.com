### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Now 25 bucks isn&#x27;t alot to pay for an excellent serum</li>
      <li>great results when applied!</li>
      <li>I did not see a great difference...</li>
      <li>I made the switch to Babyface 3 months ago and have loved it ever since!&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I love it!</li>
      <li>Will sure buy this product again when I run out!</li>
      <li>True: it doesn&#x27;t smell great; it also doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance as an ingredient</li>
      <li>I bought the Brand and product on a whim, but I am really glad I did.</li>
      <li>Made my skin feel lovely and dewy ...</li>
      <li>I have noticed a more even texture to my face.</li>
      <li>This one has moved to the top of my list.</li>
      <li>Like I said I love it</li>
      <li>Love the texture and ease of application.</li>
      <li>I recommend spending more money on a reputable product that contains quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>The price is incredible for what you are getting, and I can tell a difference in the firmness of my skin as well as a reduction in my acne (a definite plus for me!)</li>
      <li>I feel they are genuine and work as well as more costly products.</li>
      <li>This serum is loaded, and I mean LOADED with great ingredients that have proven anti-aging benefits!  </li>
      <li>Also, if you haven&#x27;t been on HSN (or QVC) it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>I knew there were other great products out there that didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
      <li>I really could not see any difference at all in skin after using a full bottle.  </li>
      <li>I like them very much.</li>
      <li>So you need to give it time for the inner layers to work their way to the top.</li>
      <li>I use hydration serum first</li>
      <li>I first heard about Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) from my dermtologist.</li>
      <li>will buy more of this in the future!</li>
      <li>First of all , it was brown.</li>
      <li>These products are absolutely top of the line; the companies just sell through a different avenue:</li>
      <li>This Babyface product is the only one I do not get from HSN and, per item, is the most I pay.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference when using the notable expensive SkinMedica product.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t write any review unless it really worth me to recommend to people.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find what I wanted on HSN (at a reasonable cost)</li>
      <li>Who wants to put the color brown on their face.</li>
      <li>Has a bit of a smell if you use too much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 58 and swear by decent products.</li>
      <li>Both absorb quickly and last all day.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to notice anything so early in use of this product.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m used to paying less than $10 for top-of-the-line products on HSN (more about that later.)</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t really notice a change on my on my facial lines</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 53 years old and have been using serums for 20 years now.</li>
      <li>It did not have a negative effect either, so that&#x27;s why I would say its just ok.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a few weeks (two), and I noticed that my face looks better overall.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands that I love but simply had to whittle down the list.</li>
      <li>Then upon further inspection , I noticed the deeper wrinkle between my brow was barely noticeable to gone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I did not see a great difference...</li>
    <li> First of all , it was brown. Who wants to put the color brown on their face. It reminded me of (will not say). So I used it 3 times and threw it away.  Who knows if it works or not.....  Brenda P</li>
    <li> no noticeable difference after a month.  Don&#x27;t think this does anything.</li>
    <li> I tried it a few times in June and it was useless so I put it aside. I wanted to try it again in January but was surprised that it has turned bad. It stinks. Seller said there is nothing they can do. I&#x27;ll use it in the backyard as fertilizer. Do not waste your money. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel lovely and dewy ...great results when applied! Will sure buy this product again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I really could not see any difference at all in skin after using a full bottle.  I won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s all in this, but it breaks my face out every time I try to use it.</li>
    <li> I first heard about Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) from my dermtologist. Her office sells Skin Medica products...which I can&#x27;t say anything bad about. But the SM product with EGF is $150.00. Being a 20+ year shopper on HSN I knew there were other great products out there that didn&#x27;t cost so much. I didn&#x27;t find what I wanted on HSN (at a reasonable cost) so I went to my second fav online store: Amazon. Now 25 bucks isn&#x27;t alot to pay for an excellent serum but I&#x27;m used to paying less than $10 for top-of-the-line products on HSN (more about that later.) I&#x27;m 53 years old and have been using serums for 20 years now. My face and neck can rival skins 10 years younger at least. But this stuff upped the game. It took a month to see a difference; 28 days or so is the time interval for epidermal skin to shed the outer layer (skin layers basically move up and out. It&#x27;s why exfoliation is important...to shed that outer dead skin layer and encourage growth.) This is not a superficial treatment; it works on the inner layers. So you need to give it time for the inner layers to work their way to the top. True: it doesn&#x27;t smell great; it also doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance as an ingredient and I like that. I do not smell it once it&#x27;s seeped into my skin. I can&#x27;t speak for the claims of it breaking out skin. It doesn&#x27;t do that to mine but, as you know, all skins are not created equal. I&#x27;m a serum junkie! This one has moved to the top of my list. I use it around my eyes too. Don&#x27;t forget your entire neck (front and back). Also, if you haven&#x27;t been on HSN (or QVC) it&#x27;s worth a try. My favs are Serious Skin Care, Dr. Jeanette Graff, and Elysee. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands that I love but simply had to whittle down the list. If you buy kits you can get 8+ products for 50-90 bucks. These products are absolutely top of the line; the companies just sell through a different avenue: no advertising cost, no real estate on a department floor or drug store shelf cost. This Babyface product is the only one I do not get from HSN and, per item, is the most I pay. But I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried using the SkinMedica TNS Recovery Complex  for about 3 months before I switched over to this product. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference when using the notable expensive SkinMedica product. I made the switch to Babyface 3 months ago and have loved it ever since!&lt;br /&gt; I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it smelling rancid or drying out.</li>
    <li> I bought the Brand and product on a whim, but I am really glad I did. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to notice anything so early in use of this product. Initially I didn&#x27;t notice the improvement, but felt the tightness of my skin. Then upon further inspection , I noticed the deeper wrinkle between my brow was barely noticeable to gone. I hope after repeated monthly use it is gone</li>
    <li> seems to work! I have been using this for a few weeks (two), and I noticed that my face looks better overall. I use this immediately after washing my face, and I feel the skin is tightening quite hard. I follow with a moisturizer, and then makeup.  Like I said I love it, didn&#x27;t think it will work this well.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more of this in the future!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this had any effect. I could not see any difference, and after it is open for a week, it starts smelling really bad. Could not bring myself to put this on my face with that smell. It did not have a negative effect either, so that&#x27;s why I would say its just ok.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face, eye area and neck. Has a bit of a smell if you use too much. My skin appears glowing and my pores are definitely smaller in just 2 weeks. Use only drops, that&#x27;s all you need. I will try other babyface products. I feel they are genuine and work as well as more costly products. I&#x27;m 58 and swear by decent products.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  It seems to do what it claims and over time it does build collagen.</li>
    <li> This low end serum is not worth purchasing.  The only result I saw was negative.  I got bumps immediately when I started using the product and I never break out.  I recommend spending more money on a reputable product that contains quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> This serum is loaded, and I mean LOADED with great ingredients that have proven anti-aging benefits!  The price is incredible for what you are getting, and I can tell a difference in the firmness of my skin as well as a reduction in my acne (a definite plus for me!) I will be continuing to repurchase this and use it in conjunction with another serum from Osmosis.</li>
    <li> It had some ingredients that I did not like, other then that, I am not sure if it is or isn&#x27;t working. I will continue to use it until it is done, I am also using the alpha-arbutin and kojic acid skin lightening and moisturizing fluid. Not sure if I will know which one is working..</li>
    <li> But I don&#x27;t really notice a change on my on my facial lines so I won&#x27;t be using it in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the texture and ease of application. Face feels nourished and refreshed. I have noticed a more even texture to my face.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write any review unless it really worth me to recommend to people. I have dry skin and working in an air conditioned working environment. That means I need extra hydration and care for my skin. I bought this serum along with babyface massive hydration serum. I use hydration serum first and then this after to lock the water. It works very well. Both absorb quickly and last all day. I like them very much. I almost finished both bottle and buying 2nd time now.</li>
