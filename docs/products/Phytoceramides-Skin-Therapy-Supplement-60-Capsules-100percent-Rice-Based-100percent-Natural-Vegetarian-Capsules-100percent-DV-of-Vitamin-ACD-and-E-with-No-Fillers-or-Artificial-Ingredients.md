<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> totally love it. .. so does my 81 yr old mom! She told me she can see a difference with her skin. My friend told me that my skin looks like a 20 yr old still.... I am more than double that age. Flattering but I do feel that this product is good.</li>
    <li> I believe that Purely Holistic is a very good company...I take the curcumin and really like it. I have almost finished this bottle of phytoceramides and can honestly say that I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my skin. Possibly it just takes longer to show results, also I already take good care of my skin and eat nutritious foods! I do appreciate that the product is non GMO!</li>
    <li> I gave this supplement a chance, took it religiously as directed on the bottle, but have not noticed any beneficial effects.</li>
    <li> Truly amazing product !</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Within the first week, I saw and felt a DRAMATIC effect on my skin&#x27;s texture. It is so incredible...you feel like you&#x27;re rubbing facial cream on your face when applying make&#x3D;up! Not kidding! it makes yourself glowing and gives you renewed hopefulness like never before. Again, someone over there needs to seriously amount the size/amount they are sending you. I am constantly reordering.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I love this brand and use them for many other supplements as well!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but I feel my skin looks overall better &amp; firmer.  Also been getting compliments saying that I look great.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works. But I&#x27;m also using other supplements&lt;br /&gt;for my skin. I believe they are working synergistically.</li>
    <li> After 30 days these did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this supplement for about 2 1/2 weeks and can see a definite improvement in the appearance of my skin. I will continue using this product and look forward to even better results. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Was waiting a few weeks before writing this review since I was skeptical about the results that were stated about this supplement.  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.  I have noticed a positive difference in my skin since I started taking it.  My skin is prone to rosacea so I am always concerned about products aggravating it, this did not at all, in fact there appears to be more evenness in my skin tone.  Will definitely be buying this again!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use as I was losing weight, to keep my skin from getting too loose, it appears to be working, I have lost 25 lbs and have not seen wrinkles or stretch marks, I am definitely going to keep trying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the supplement for about 3 weeks.  It&#x27;s easy to swallow and I haven&#x27;t had any adverse effects.  However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;ll continue for bit longer.</li>
    <li> I took advantage of the free bottle if I would give a review.  I would take this product again.  It took a couple of weeks, but I do feel that my skin looked better when I was taking it.  I&#x27;m 60 years old.  I think my skin just looked healthier when I was taking it.  I think I noticed it more after I hadn&#x27;t taken it for about a week or so. If I didn&#x27;t have so many health issues that I have to work on to try to feel good, I would definitely continue taking it!  I do think it&#x27;s a good product!.</li>
    <li> im comparing this to another phytoceramide product I used prior and will go back to that priduce</li>
    <li> I have purchased about 6 bottles in the past.  I can&#x27;t say that it works or not.  But the explanation of how it works was interesting and enticing.  The problem I have with this product has nothing to do with the effectiveness, rather how it is packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every bottle I have received has a plastic seal around the cap and bottle that reads, &amp;#34;sealed for your protection.&amp;#34;  It is absolutely useless.  The cap twists on and off multiple times and never effects the seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no other protective seal to the bottle, and I am not comfortable knowing how easily this could be tampered with.  If I am going to ingest a pill that is purchased over the internet, it needs at least the minimum protection that you could expect from any drug store or Walmart.</li>
    <li> I returned it as I found another product I liked better</li>
    <li> I received the Phytoceramides for testing purposes. I have been on this product for less than a week now. I notice that these pills do not make me break out and there have been no side effects on my skin or in my stomach since I do have a sensitivity to both.&lt;br /&gt;I also notice a glow, a healthy glow on my face but to really see and get proven results I would have to finish the whole bottle which I intend to do since no side effects occurred. The pills are veggie pills so that gives me a sense of relief knowing I&#x27;m using a beneficial product on my skin and in my body.</li>
    <li> I have been taking the Purely Holistic Phytocermides supplement in the evening for almost three weeks and have noticed a huge improvement in skin tone and texture. I have mild melasma that always gets worse in the summer no matter how much sunscreen I put on. The melasma has faded significantly since I began using this product. I am very happy with the results so far and how quickly I noticed the improvements. I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Have been taking this phytoceramide for three weeks.  My skin is smoother, tighter, &amp; completely soft to the touch.  I am very pleased with this product &amp; would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve the texture of their skin.  It is easy to take, has no side effects &amp; does a wonderful job.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> This was delivered fast and really made my skin look good, for the time I took it !!!</li>
    <li> did not work as well as the Miracle ones did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this supplement for almost three weeks and have noticed that my skin is more hydrated. The fine lines around my eyes have become less noticeable. With continued use of this supplement, I believe I will more improvement in the fine lines. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is not dry anymore.</li>
    <li> After deciding to try phytoceramides I purchased this product because it was one of the most natural (plus I am a vegetarian and so anything with gelatin ingredients was out). It also seemed that rice-derived was better than wheat-derived. After reading other reviews it seems results are not seen quickly and so I purchased several months supply to give it a fair try. Also why I waited for a few months to provide a review. I already use products on my face and so decided the rest of my body (particularly the back of my hands) was the best place to gauge. l have not used any hand cream in the past few months either, to create a more &#x27;controlled test&#x27;. I perceive that my skin is feeling less dry and the back of my hands seems less dry also. I believe this product has improved the moisture levels in my skin however I will have a firmer conclusion in another few months. The only negative of this product is the &#x27;tamper-proof&#x27; seal, which is not tamper proof at all. Great customer service though.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  Good product</li>
    <li> Love this product! I can tell a difference in the smoothness and hydration of my skin very quickly. Definitely one to try if you&#x27;re on the fence about it, and the customer service is phenomenal, they truly care about their service.</li>
    <li> Have not really noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> My skin is getting better. I like the results I&#x27;m seeing so far.</li>
    <li> I really get a good results from taking these phytoceramides daily.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference under my chin, and around my neck and decoletage.  Possibly even my upper arms. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these, taking one daily, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> This are easy to swallow, great customer service when asked questions.  I purchased 2 bottles because I know it take 6 weeks to see results.  I have used a couple other brands, this one is rice based.  I look forward to results from this family owned brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using rice based Phytoceramides for 3 weeks now and can honestly say I have not seen a difference in my skin. I am 69 years old and assume it might take longer to see results. I am also using Vitamin A, C and Hyuralonic Acids on my face. I have friends who are also using the Phytoceramides in my age group and we are all hopeful. Anne Boisclair from NH</li>
    <li> This product helped my skin find its inner beauty as well as outer beauty.  No bad reactions, no awful smells. Easy to swallow and digest. Will be purchasing again.  Fast shipping from seller. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it! These are very easy to swallow, no tummy problems or problems taking this pill. My skin has been looking a more radiant then usual! I&#x27;m excited to see how much better my skin looks after a month or so of use! I love how these are made in the USA and are 100% natural! NO fillers or artificial ingredients and vegetarians can use them! I am so excited to reduce my fine lines and ward off any wrinkles!!</li>
    <li> I honestly feel that this makes a difference in my skin. I am on my second bottle and I plan to continue taking it. The fine lines around my eyes have diminished drastically. I usually don&#x27;t trust reviewers... but here I am making a review. LOL! Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several months. It does work but not the miraculous way the pictures show. The results I have received are.....the fine lines around the eyes, lips and mouth are not as pronounced but they are there.  My daughter said I looked rested and not drained of energy. That was a nice improvement. I do not want to look twenty years younger, just healthy and great for my age!! Phytoceramides has helped me accomplish this.</li>
    <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin, but I have seen a difference in my energy level!  I didn&#x27;t see that coming!  So for that, I will keep using and hope that my skin and hair also get some of that vitality!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product, but after researching solutions for hydrating skin and obtaining younger looking skin, I decided to give Phytoceramide a try. It makes sense to improve your skin from the inside out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed improvement. I noticed wrinkles beginning to smooth and a fullness coming back to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I tried this product!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several months and my skin looks great. I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in fine lines. The delivery is quick and the company is very responsive and great to work with.</li>
    <li> I received this product on May 14, it has been over a week and I am already seeing some fine lines disappear. I took a picture on Day 1 and then just took another picture and you can definitely see the difference. I am excited to see what the difference is after a month of taking this. I would definitely recommend and encourage others to take Phytoceramide.</li>
    <li> I am sorry but I had to return two of the three bottles I ordered  today, I was having some effects from the vitamins,  maybe to many as I am taking vitamins now that my doctor suggest I should be on.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast and I started taking right away.  My friend taking this product is having amazing results and I look forward to the same.</li>
    <li> This product does work to improve skin quality!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, who recently had cataract surgery, and no longer had to wear glasses; the downside was that she was concerned about wrinkles around her eyes now being so visible! After a couple of weeks of use, I thought her fine wrinkles were lessened slightly; she wasn&#x27;t so sure about that. But more importantly, she found her hair and her skin somewhat oily - she developed zits for the first time since she was a teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has since stopped taking this, and I am going to try it for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered promptly, and the company followed up to ensure satisfaction.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP6e0327ed0a04b09000820c9d98f48991&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for 2 months now with the only results being that my skin isn&#x27;t so dry anymore. I do still have dry patches and/or flaky skin in places, not sure if it will clear those up after more use. I remain hopeful though, and continue to use this daily as it is safe to take and doesn&#x27;t cause me any adverse reactions. &amp;#60;&amp;#60;this is important because I have taken Phytoceramides before that caused diarrhea. It was great that this brand did not.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM6e0327ed0a04b09000820c9d98f48991&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Was excited to try these after I heard a great review from Dr.Oz , I also love how its all natural and that they&#x27;re easy to swallow. So far I feel and look better than I usually do and no side effects!</li>
    <li> I love purely holistic is work great for me</li>
    <li> Has changed not just my face by skin all over my body. :)</li>
    <li> Decided to give this a supplement a try after reading all of the great reviews!</li>
    <li> Well, I wouldn&#x27;t go that far, but it&#x27;s close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve only been using for a week, I am beginning to see some positive changes.  The crow&#x27;s feet have diminished some and my skin is definitely less dry.  That&#x27;s after a week - can&#x27;t wait to see what improvements I&#x27;ll see in a month!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the Dr. Oz&#x27;s show, I love his show since every tip i&#x27;ve tried from it has worked wonders. This is not the exception! I love the product, I am 52 years old and have been using anti wrinkle creams for years, but it is only logical that it works better if you eat them rather than just rub it on. I am taking the pills and using my beauty creams and I&#x27;ll tell you I have noticed a change! I feel my skin more hydrated and soft. Great product!!! And the best of all, it is made of NATURAL PRODUCTS!!! Thanks Dr. Oz!!!</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference..But also did not use it very long.</li>
    <li> What a difference in my face! Wow, I didn&#x27;t expect to see any results with my first bottle but 2weeks in and I could see a change.  My face just looked like I glowed.  Diffinatly  a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I love it! I feel changes to my skin already! Thanks for fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to these Phytoceramides, so I was a little unsure when getting this bottle to try. I mean, can you really find a facelift in a bottle? That I don&#x27;t know-but I do know I am seeing improvements all the time since taking this. There must be something to having 100% DV of vitamins A, C, D &amp; E!&lt;br /&gt;I love that this brand uses a vegetarian capsule and is gluten-free. I am not a person who has to avoid gluten but when I can, I do; because it is difficult for our bodies to process. It can be in so many things unnecessarily so I find it a big bonus when it&#x27;s avoided.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you wonder where these things are coming from when you buy them online. This one comes from the USA so at least there is a little peace of mind there.&lt;br /&gt;Those were the main factors that stand out when you are sorting through so many brands. Even better-it comes with a 100% Money Back Guarantee so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. What have I gained since taking phytoceramides?&lt;br /&gt;-Softer skin&lt;br /&gt;-Glow&lt;br /&gt;-Better skin tone&lt;br /&gt;-Better overall texture&lt;br /&gt;-Smaller pores&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no longer taking separate vitamin supplements since they are all encapsulated into one. The convenience alone is a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;And I couldn&#x27;t even tell you where those other supplements I was taking were manufactured!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample bottle of this and after using for a week, I am already noticing a difference in my skin. I do have a few fine lines on my face and they have reduced a little bit since I started using this product. I am excited to see the results after using for a month.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I took it for about 3 wks. and began to notice improvements in my skin. After 4wks. a store clerk said my skin was just glowing. I have had several friends want to know what I was doing that my complexion looked great. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have recently started breaking out.  At 30-something.  Never did I break out in my teenage years, but now I am.  I also started having some discoloration, redness, and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I started taking these about a week and a half ago, and I have noticed a tremendous improvement in my skin.  Not only on my face (the acne isn&#x27;t as bad as it was, my skintone is starting to even out, and my skin is not as dry.) but my legs as well.  I usually have to apply lotion a few times a day, but haven&#x27;t had to as much lately.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking to repair their skin, and to even help prevent skin problems from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased opinion.  I was not compensated in any other way.</li>
    <li> after using the product for almost a week i can say my skin looks clearer and i am getting more and more compliments on how my skin really looks as well as more and more people staring at my skin, it&#x27;s changing slowly from it&#x27;s nearly unmanageable type to more manageable and clearer healthy looking skin, i always say it is never to late to start taking care of your body from the inside out, this product with all it&#x27;s vitamins could never do harm, to me i am highly allergic to orange juice or citrus fruit and having the added vitamins with vitamin c is a benefit anyone will enjoy, i have to say it is now part of a must have for any skin care routine including mine, it is one product i will definitely feature as a must have for all. I still can&#x27;t get over how beautiful my skin is looking this product is actually helping with my scalp psoriasis to where i am barely having flakes anymore, soon i wont have any at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My wife and I like that this supplement is made with vitamins that are good for your body. My wife has tried it for a week and has already noticed an improvement in her skin. The improvements are slow, but she notices that her skin is not so dry and feelings smoother. Her hands are softer and some lines in her face have faded already. Her friends notice a more youthful look. They wondered if she had her hair done or something else at the beauty parlor. She is looking forward to more positive results.</li>
    <li> I have been taking the rice based Phytoceramides and my skin is really enjoying the benefits of healing from the inside out.  To anyone that is considering Botox or a facelift, please try this product before you jump into something that could damage your appearance for the rest of your life.  You have nothing to lose by taking this skin therapy supplement because they offer a 100% money back guarantee.  I&#x27;m confident after seeing the results I&#x27;ve experienced by using this product, that you won&#x27;t need that money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helped my skin discoloration after a bad skin infection! Only been taking it a month and I can see a bunch of improvement!</li>
    <li> The Phytoceramides Skin Therapy Supplement has been amazing!  I love that it&#x27;s 100% pure and free of GMO&#x27;s.  I am already seeing results on my skin with the fine lines I have on my face, and are going away one by one and my skin is already looking brighter!  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for great results for the skin!</li>
    <li> So far so good a very reasonable price for some great benefits for the user!</li>
    <li> I bought several bottles of this and tried it out for  approx 3 months. It did nothing.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product!  I will continue to use it with the expectation of continued great results.</li>
    <li> I just started taking this supplement. It&#x27;s small and easy to swallow. Gluten free, contains 30 veggie capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phytoceramides helps correct:&lt;br /&gt;Crow&#x27;s feet, Ages spots, dark eye circles, sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phytoceramides leaves skin looking:&lt;br /&gt;Visibly brighter, healthier, more evenly tones, free of discoloration and blemishes</li>
    <li> I just received my second bottle of this supplement. It comes quickly and feel it is of good quality. It&#x27;s made in the USA and that&#x27;s important. I can&#x27;t give an opinion on results yet. I think it takes awhile for that.</li>
    <li> Waited a month for results, still waiting.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these for the past 2 weeks and I plan on taking them until the bottle is empty – so 1st off I am thirsty about ½ hour after I take these pills - also these taste terrible so swallow fast– SO I am drinking more which is good and also the added benefits of the added vitamins is a plus for these pills.  I am also gluten-free so being rice based is another plus.  I have yet to find a downside to these pills. Plus plus plus for sure so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking these pills for 2 weeks this is what I have discovered.  My hands - this is what I first noticed about 12 days after taking the product - my hands looked less sunken and the veins that stick out seemed less pronounced.  I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about the pills when my eyes caught a good look at my hands and I thought, &amp;#34;when did they start to look pretty again?&amp;#34;  I have always had veins sticking up in my hands and arms, but lately(last 2 years or so) they seemed to be huge and today they look smaller since the skin around them looks better and more fuller.  This alone makes me smile and think these are worth taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my face I cannot say I see a huge difference yet- remember it has only been 2 weeks-  but my hands speak volumes about this product so I will keep taking them and see what happens.  I do expect my face to plump up like my hands and that should help the thinness under my eyes look better and my crows feet to improve - I am 45 years old and I have extremely pale skin and so some days, from a lack of sleep, the skin under my eyes is very dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the change will be small when this bottle of pills runs out so that is why I am not waiting to post this review, but I plan on buying more of these pills and continuing this process for at least 3 months since 12 weeks is when they say you will really see a difference in your face.  I already see a difference in my hands so I know it will be coming for my face.  I have taken before shots of my faceso I will take one at 12 weeks and let you know.</li>
    <li> Only used a few weeks but working nicely. Recommend</li>
    <li> Love these Phytoceramides that Purely Holistic sent me to review for my GlamRiver blog!  I have never tried&lt;br /&gt;Phytoceramides &amp; I am a HUGE supplement fan so I was really interested in trying these out.  I have been taking these for a few weeks now and so far I am loving the results.  My skin seems to stay more hydrated &amp; maybe even a little more plump.  I will continue my Phytoceramides routine so I am sure with continued use it will help keep away those nasty wrinkles! :)</li>
    <li> I used Phytoceramides Skin Therapy Supplement for 30 days and I found that the skin on my face, hands and arms felt smoother and softer.  The wrinkles on my face seemed less noticeable and the skin on my hands and arms seemed to be getting thicker (like it was in the past).  I am planning on continuing taking this supplement since I have noticed positive results.</li>
    <li> So far, I have been using the product for 7 weeks and see moderate improvements but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;I am optimistic though and am reordering 2 more months worth to see if it works for me.  As a older person, my wrinkles are deep and have been there for a long time so might take a bit longer to see a major difference.  Not giving up yet!</li>
    <li> I received this product in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;Since losing over 130 pounds I have noticed a lot more fine lines and wrinkles. I don&#x27;t have the fat anymore to fill in my face, lol. When I was chosen to review this product I was extremely excited. I have been self conscious of my skin. I am only 32 I should have so many wrinkles. I got my bottle of supplements extremely fast the bottle was a good size and taken as directed had plenty of servings for the price. I started taking them about 3 weeks ago and have noticed a difference! I have had a decrease in my crows feet and have noticed a huge difference in the skin where my &amp;#34;double chin&amp;#34; used to be. My skin seems to glow now. I have also noticed a difference in the skin all over my body. It seems firmer and much more supple. The pills are easy to swallow and don&#x27;t leave any aftertaste. I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> 100% Vitamin A, C, D, &amp; E.  Great value at a great price.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, good customer service, like that the product is gmo-free, and have only tried the product for about a week but my skin seems to be more hydrated and softer to the touch</li>
    <li> Finally, an honest to goodness supplement that delivers awesome results! 3 weeks and you will get a great good, younger and glowing skin. I love this product to the max!!!</li>
    <li> Only tried it for 1 month too early to tell.</li>
    <li> Now this is a very cool product. If you haven’t heard of Phytoceramides Skin Therapy Supplement then I’m glad you found my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How awesome would it be to say goodbye wrinkles without the botox or expensive surgery? Well look no further Phytoceramides Skin Therapy Supplement has been scientifically proven in improving the signs of aging  These phytoceramides hydrate, thicken and bind the skin from the inside out. Which naturally reverses the aging process while making your skin fuller, thicker to reduce the winkles and crow’s feet.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product!!</li>
    <li> As a former Cosmetologist, I have to say that after using this for 30 days the results were noticeable, my skin feels smoother, lines are softening and it did help clear up my Peri-menopausal breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;As a former Cosmetologists here is my advise to others: You will have to maintain using this for at least 27 days to see the results, don&#x27;t expect to see it right away! 27 days is the average rate you skin rejuvenates it self from the inside out. As you age this rejuvenation process can take longer that the 27 days. The reviews that show results within a few days are mistaking something else for the product this, like most supplements, take time and commitment to see results. That being said, easy peasy, take a pill once a day with a meal and keep it up and expect to take it for 90 days to see the full results on your skin! I would recommend buying 3 bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement for nearly a week and have noticed a more hydrated and full look to my skin, specifically on my face. I was fortunate in receiving this product free to try and have been pleasantly surprised by the results. I plan to continue using this product and look forward to seeing what the results are after more extended use. I would recommend others to try the product.</li>
    <li> used for 2 months, saw no results at all.</li>
    <li> I have been taking  the Phytoceramide Skin Therapy for several months now.  I am 75 and have my share of aging lines and shallow wrinkles, but mostly around the eyes and my smile lines.  I can&#x27;t really be sure, but I feel like the bagginess under my eyes is definitely less and  my two oldest granddaughters recently exclaimed, &amp;quot;Grandma, your skin looks so pretty&amp;quot;.  And that came out of the blue.  No prodding or questions like &amp;quot;how does my skin look?&amp;quot; .  So, I will keep taking this supplement for sure.  I have been told that I don&#x27;t look my age now for a number of  years and I would love to keep that going !&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only gotten to try it a few days, but in that time I&#x27;ve noticed a great difference in my skin. I love all the vitamins it has and that it is gluten free and vegetarian. Really recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a fast working skin supplement and that it&#x27;s efficient.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any effects for the first week, but I stuck with it and finished the bottle. I noticed my skin looked more hydrated and less red. It appeared to be in better condtion. It also felt better to the touch.  Good product overall.</li>
    <li> Within a couple of weeks, I could see and feel results!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to see results, based on all the good reviews. A little after two weeks of taking them, I did started to notice my skin looking fresher. I usually have oily, acne prone skin, but since I&#x27;ve been taking these phytoceramides, my skin seems more balanced. I also have had far fewer  breakouts. A friend of mine, who knows nothing about phytoceramides, told me he loved how soft and smooth my face was, after he gave me a kiss on my forehead. I&#x27;ve never got that compliment from anyone ever. So, I definitely believe this stuff is working.</li>
    <li> Ok..., so I was a sceptic at first. Took this as stated on the bottle, and after the first week my skin appeared to be healthier. So I kept taking more, and after two weeks the dark circles under my eyes seemed to fade and my &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; around my eyes did too! I can see this is a gradual change and not an &amp;#34;over night&amp;#34; remedy. I&#x27;m only 38 and tried this because they offered me a free trial bottle, but I am convinced this product works and I plan to order more just to see how effective it will be in the long run. Great product! Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Really loved using and reviewing this product! hope to be purchasing more soon!</li>
    <li> This supplement works as advertised.  I noticed a reduction in pitting, and dark spots from acne.  I read somewhere that it helped with the dark marks under your eyes, but noticed no change there.  I wanted to try it for the spot reduction, from acne in my case.  It certainly seemed to make a difference.  I plan to order another when I am in a position to.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve only been taking it a week or so, and I appreciate receiving my sample for free. I&#x27;m also grateful that it&#x27;s not one of those huge horse pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thus far not really noticing a *huge* difference, but don&#x27;t such things take awhile?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that my extremely dry skin seems to be retaining moisture more easily, and my hands look much less... &amp;#34;pruney&amp;#34;, for lack of a better word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I *think* it&#x27;s actually helping my hair and nails more than my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;shrug&amp;#62; No proof, but just passing on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to how I feel when I finish the whole bottle!</li>
    <li> I did not notice any real difference when taking these Phytoceramides.  I took them for 2 months. However, it just may be that they did not work for me but will work for you.  I live in hope of finding something that will make a difference.  I contacted the company and they were very nice and refunded my money promptly.</li>
    <li> Phytoceramides is a &amp;#34;Natural Facelift&amp;#34;. It hydrates, thickens and binds the skin from inside out. This helps reverse the aging process that naturally occurs with skin, making your skin look fuller and thicker while reducing wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet.&lt;br /&gt;Restoring the ceramides in our skin is very important because we lose this over time. In restoring this, our skin barrier becomes more resilient and our skim is able to retain more moisture. This helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. Within one month of taking this product, you will see the most noticeable difference bu your skin feeling more moisturized and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Purely Holistics Phytoceramides use rice based phytoceramides which have been clinically proven to be better than Liowheat based phytoceramides. Clinical studies have proven that rice based phytoceramides were up to 33% more effective at improving the signs of aging skin than wheat phytoceramides.&lt;br /&gt;This product will leave your skin looking brighter, healthier and more evenly toned. While making your skin feel more hydrated, it also helps with discoloration and blemishes. This product is made in the USA and used with 100% natural ingredients. These capsules are also suitable for vegetarians. They are gluten free and fortified with vitamins A, C, D and E for maximum results.I received this product to test in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Okay I have to be openly honest I wasn&#x27;t to sure that these would work and I was pretty skeptical about them. I mean PLEASE for the love of all that&#x27;s good don&#x27;t ask me to pronounce the name out loud!&lt;br /&gt;I was thank goodness proven wrong! HA!&lt;br /&gt; I haven&#x27;t been taking them for very long and even though my face still breaks out I can tell the difference in my skin from fine lines ( I have hooooooorrible crow&#x27;s feet already started from squinting), my dark under eye circles- which are now lighter, to the younger looking skin on my neck and hands.&lt;br /&gt;I think that the longer I take this the better things can only get for me! Who doesn&#x27;t want better looking skin? And doing it from the inside out.... easy! They come in a pill form and are easy to sallow.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not always one to keep up with the &#x27;latest&#x27; thing, but to my slight surprise phytoceramides are becoming huge in popularity, as people turn to more natural things&lt;br /&gt; Which I am a HUGE fan of! BTW - this is a product that is made here in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;Want to read the full review? Check out The Visser Clan</li>
    <li> Skin therapy medicine supplements of course work differently person to person. I took these as advised, with food or water. After a month or so, I started seeing the difference in my skin and hair. The pills don&#x27;t taste very good, so swallow quickly. You get tons of pills in the bottle so will last you a good amount, enough to notice a difference in them.</li>
    <li> I only used 1 bottle but I didn&#x27;t notice any change at all. I don&#x27;t think it did anything. Wasted my money on this.</li>
    <li> These have made my skin look amazing I have a natural glow and my skin looks even.</li>
    <li> There is no noticeable difference after taking the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> Just too soon to say... only using it for 1 week</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on this for a month and do notice a difference in body muscle pain!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t zee any difference yet</li>
    <li> So far so good not sick yet. Had a sore throat bumped up the pills and was fine the next day</li>
    <li> I tried it this one and another brand for  3 months and returned  :  Nothing  - No improvements  anywhere , another of  Dr. Oz  big promos , I am sure it is helping him .  I believe there are professional review writers that get paid to write good reviews .  We sure need laws for Truth in Advertising .</li>
    <li> I have been using the Phytoceramides for about three weeks now and my skin does have a better tone and brightness.  It is not dramatic at this point but I def see a positive difference.  I will continue to take this supplement and if I continue to see improvements it will go on my &amp;#34;gotta have&amp;#34; list.  I have not seen improvement in crows feet but that may be down the road.  I love the brighter tone of my face!  I will update and maybe up the star rating if things keep getting better!</li>
    <li> worth a try&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve taken this for about a month and haven&#x27;t seen any visible results in my skin. but i had no issues taking the pill, no side effects, tasted ok.</li>
    <li> These skin therapy supplement works great, try them and see for yourself</li>
    <li> Totally worth it!  Love this product!  Shipping and delivery was prompt as well!&lt;br /&gt;Will order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished a whole bottle.  Although I haven&#x27;t seen any less wrinkles, my skin does seem less dry.  I haven&#x27;t done anything else, so it must be the supplement.</li>
    <li> I AM GIVING THIS ITEM 3 STARS BECAUSE I HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN USING IT LONG ENOUGH TO TELL WHETHER I NOTICE A DIFFERENCE OR NOT......IF I SEE A DIFFERENCE, I WILL DEFINITLY REORDER.....I AM HOPING THAT I DO.</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Skin is noticeably softer!</li>
    <li> I Have only been using the product for about three months and I have noticed a big difference in my skin. My husband said he sees a big difference so I will keep using. I am 68 and have always taken good care of my skin. I do not want to go under the knife so I believe this product with time will bring nice results, I do not expect to look 40 again, but well preserved would be nice. Love the great customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not completely sure of my results yet but I believe my skin is starting to be a little less rough and dry. I&#x27;m still on my first bottle so it might take a little longer to see better results.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement for a few weeks.  Yesterday I looked at my hands thinking &amp;#34;go get a manicure&amp;#34; only to realize how youthful my skin looked.  It&#x27;s true, the skin on your hands reveal your age-and I&#x27;m looking pretty young!  I plan on taking this ongoing.  Thank you Purely Holistic for this amazing product and the drastic changes it is making in my life.</li>
    <li> First time buyer in May. Working great for me. Wife tried it, now she swears by it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery, product and overall experience.  Already seeing noticeable improvements after less than two weeks of use... I am almost seventy years old and to still get compliments on my skin is exciting!  Now I am looking forward to the anticipated cumulative results from further usage of Phytoceramides Skin Therapy  Supplement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thanks to Dr. Oz for making me aware of phytoceramides and to Purely Holistic for your all-natural products at such reasonable prices!!!  Plan to purchase some of your other products as well in the very near future.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because Dr Oz talk about Phytoceramide on his show, and how it is like botox in a pill form. I have only been using it for the past three days and I really love this product. I see drastic improvement with dark circles under my eyes, smile lines, and my skin looks younger. I would recommend this product to everybody that wish to reverse some of the aging effects.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of Purely Holistic Phytoceramides and my skin felt softer, looked clearer and my nails strengthened. After I finished the bottle, I purchased another brand with wheat...my nails got brittle and my skin was grayer. So, after a week, I went back to the Purely Holistic Phytoceramides with rice. My skin and nails and coming back awesomely. I also take their Turmeric everyday. It&#x27;s awesome, too.</li>
    <li> This product has made my skin softer as I see fine lines disappear too!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement for quite some time now and I have noticed that my skin has been looking brighter and more rejuvenated - so I would have to say that this supplement is doing its job as an anti-aging product. My hair and nails have also been benefiting from it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is loving this product and it has truly been a godsend because now, I can get away with wearing less or no makeup! I don&#x27;t need as much coverage because this product is truly a big help on my skin. Thank you, Purely Holistic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

I&#x27;m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

    <li> Love this I have been using it since I got it , a big difference in how my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I have taken one pill a day for the last few weeks, and while it does make me want to drink more water (which is a great thing), there are no negative side effects.It can take some time to notice the results, as is the case with most oral supplements, but I have noticed that my under eye circles are not as noticeable, and my face looks brighter. All in all, I recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I have been using Purely Holistic Skin Therapy Supplements for two weeks. During the summer months I usually find that my skin, especially my legs lose a lot of moisture. For this review most people would compare the state of their face or arms, I really wanted to see the difference this supplement would do for my legs.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin on my legs, I lovingly refer to them as alligator legs as they are visibly scaly during the summer months. I have tried, unsuccessfully, several lotions, most were made specifically for dry skin. After the first week, of taking Purely Holistic Skin Therapy Supplements, and the use of my favorite lotion, Jergen&#x27;s (love that Cherry Almond scent), I noticed I didn&#x27;t have to slather half as much on. By the end of the second week I noticed that although the scaliness was still there they didn&#x27;t appear dry. After noting these results, I took a quick look at my skin in general, my elbows are softer, my arms are not ashy and my lips have needed less balm. I can see a much needed change in my skin&#x27;s overall health.&lt;br /&gt;- See more at: http://collidinguniverse.blogspot.com/2014/09/skin-renewal-with-phytoceramides.html#sthash.h9QJq5y7.dpuf</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of phytoceramides from a health food store a few months ago and found within 1.5 weeks a marked difference, especially  my eyes.  The sclera (white of eye) appeared to be whiter, and appeared healthier;the skin also appeared with more hydration.  My husband noticed the difference and that&#x27;s going some for him to comment.  I bought this type (2 bottles, purely holistic).  and found no difference in my skin.  The marketing of this company raved that its far better than the wheat derivative.  I&#x27;d like to return the second bottle as I have used this for approx 4 weeks with no results.  Wasted my time and money.</li>
    <li> I love skin supplements and these are one of my go tos now. Love it!</li>
    <li> I just recently started taking these pills. So far so good, they are very easy to swallow, since Ive only been taking them for a short while , they&#x27;re haven&#x27;t been any dramatic results but I do notice more plum skin. I will come back to review when my results start showing !</li>
    <li> great product to have for healthy skin</li>
    <li> Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I&#x27;m satisfied with the product because it helped my wrinkle that were about to form around my mouth area to disappear and it improving my wrinkle on my neck. My skin definitely look better then before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell/Taste:&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell and taste, It didn&#x27;t smell that bad and there wasn&#x27;t that much of the aftertaste to it either. It just smells like pills so it&#x27;s not anxious in smell in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients Check (for me): I love how it doesn&#x27;t have other additives that aren&#x27;t needed and it&#x27;s gluten free.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;m allergic to wheat so this is wonderful!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Have used this for 40 days and noticed lines near my mouth are less visible and fullness is back to my skin.I am 50 yrs old but my skin look&lt;br /&gt; more younger and I use less make up now.Very happy I tried this supplement and definitely recommend to others.I wasn&#x27;t so sure if I should try it&lt;br /&gt; at first because it sounds to good to be true but I am so happy I did it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for quite awhile &amp; definitely saw results. My skin looked &amp; felt better then it did before trying this product. When I was using this product it made my skin visibly brighter, more evenly toned and healthier all things this product says it helps with. I’m still young but think it’s never to soon to try products to prevent aging effects on your skin. I liked that this product supplement was 100% pure with no GMO’S which is always sometime I look for in products. I am overall happy with the results I saw after using this product and definitely would use this product again sometime in the future. It&#x27;s all around a great product &amp; I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement for a few weeks now.i have very sensitive,oily but also see wrinkles starting.i also have excema on my extremeties,this is why I wanted to try this supplement.i also look for all natural,and preferably gluten free vitamins and supplements.this product has exactly what I look for.thanks!}</li>
    <li> I have been taking these pills for almost a week now and already I notice a difference. I can&#x27;t believe my eyes! I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I figured you never know unless you try. I am so glad I did! I have already recommended it to a few friends and family members so I am also recommending it to anyone out there reading this review.</li>
    <li> This is does wonders. Great product. High quality ingredients. Trusted seller. No noticed adverse effects. Will recommend</li>
    <li> i purchased two bottles and took one each day. I am down to 4 left out of 60. I&#x27;m not sure that i see a huge difference, but i have noticed the lines under my eyes seems to be ... less obvious. Knowing the body takes time to heal itself; whether using topical skin creams or taking oral vitamins (skin cell turnover - for ALL people is 28 days) and knowing nothing is &#x27;overnight&#x27; except maybe cosmetic surgery, i am willing to give it some more time. I have also noticed a difference in the past 10 days, due to an excellent peptide serum - Deep Beneath the Skin, by Pumped with Peptides (or www.pumpedwithpeptides.com). I have only been applying that to my forehead, however that has been the BIGGEST change and I will continue with that up to 90 days, since that may be working a little better:))</li>
    <li> Delivered on time! Seeing a noticeable difference after using it in just two weeks!</li>
    <li> Should not have purchased without talking to my doctor.  She said not to take it!</li>
    <li> The service was great...The phytoceramides arrived a couple days after I ordered them.  The capsules are easy to swallow.  I have been taking the capsules for five days and as of today have not noticed any difference in my skin. I am 69 years old, have been told I look about 55. I have always taken care of my skin, so I ordered a 90 day supply to give this product a chance. I trust Dr Oz and watched all the videos and researched all I could.  I will let you know how this progresses for me.  I am going to rate this a five star for customer service. Jury still out on product...</li>
    <li> I have been taking Purely Holistic&#x27;s Phytoceramides Skin Therapy Supplement for about 2 weeks now.  I do see improvement in the smoothness and plumpness of my skin.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used Purely Holistic  Pytocerarmides daily for three weeks and my skin has improved.  My wrinkles are much less noticeable.  I am happy about the improvement .  A  capsule a day is my new slogan.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 30 days and have already seen results. I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I have only taken the product for a few weeks and like the idea that it is a holistic product.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle and I will continue to use this product as I can see positive results from taking it.</li>
    <li> I can see a feel the improvements in my skin.  Even my dermatologist said my skin looked great!  Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been t asking this for week n half.  I have already noticed a difference in my skin. My crinkled eyes look better. My skin looks and feels amazing. Better yet the product is all natural. You get 5 stars !!!</li>
    <li> I love this product my skin looks healthier already I have an even skin tone for the 1st time in a very long time. I have a nice glow to my skin, I feel like I look like a million bucks. U really need  to try this product.</li>

Vitamin C to speed cell renewal and enhance collagen production, Beta-carotene to combat the damage triggered by free radicals, Vitamin E to assist, combat free radicals and speed the skin healing process. It&#x27;s also gluten free.&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with this product! Within 2  weeks of using my skin feels smoother and it doesn&#x27;t feel as dry. I cant wait to keep using this product and see how much better my skin will look and feel. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have only been taking phytoceramides for a few weeks but notice there are less fine lines at the side of my eyes and my skin looks healthier.  There are no gmos or filler ingredients. I feel Purely Holistic&#x27;s supplements are safe to use and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Phytoceramides Skin Therapy Supplement for approx 3 weeks and I have to admit that my skin does feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully more improvement will come as I continue to this Supplement.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  I receive it about 2 weeks ago and am using it daily.  It appears to to be working well and I will continue using it.  I would have rated 5 stars but need more time to fully assess it.  However, I may come back with a further review and even higher rating.  A very good product for me and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> So I saw phytocermaides discussed on Dr. Oz. As we all know, i was quite skeptical. But i couldnt stop thinking about giving them a shot. I am so glad i did! They help hydrate the skin from the inside and put the ceramides back into the skin. These have helped my skin look more youthful. The difference is amazing! They have added a healthy glow to my skin! I have noticed diminished wrinkles and smoother, softer skin! How amazing!&lt;br /&gt;These are made here in the usa from all natUral ingredients, which is important to me! They were easy to swallow! I am happy to have recieved the&#x27;s to review! I recommend that anyone wanting a more youthful, glowing face definitely give these a try! They are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I Dont work for this company and was not paid to write this review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my first bottle and thought how this little lightweigjt capsule can do what the before and after pictures on Google Images show.  (Google [phytoceramides before and after] then search under &#x27;images&#x27; instead of &#x27;web&#x27;).  *****If you do not have the patience to let it saturate in your blood stream (one and a half months for me) you may discontinue and miss out*****.  One day I woke up and looked in the mirror and the puffiness I was used to seeing under my eyes was GONE not diminished GONE.  My finger nails are really hard too-  I know because I have a habit of bitting them now they cut my tongue when I bite; they are very hard now.  As a matter of fact, its been almost two weeks I&#x27;ve been out and the effect is still there, folks just take your little capsule faithfully everyday give it 30-60 days.  Then write your review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 2 caps with food per day the first month to start saturating my blood stream quickly then one cap per day with food afterwards for 2 months, it needs the fat to absorb well that&#x27;s why you want the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have Melasma so I have been using a topical creme toghether with Lypospheric Glutathione and Vit C tabs orally and Glutathione soap/sunscreen, etc., to control hyperpigmentation,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Phytoceramides (Only RICE based of course), are in a class all their own</li>
