      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>We have always used eyebrows (glue on kind) for my husband who plays SANTA ever year at my preschool....</li>
      <li>I sealed it with baby powder, and while I didn&#x27;t achieve a perfect seal, the paint didn&#x27;t rub off too much.  </li>
      <li>I tried to warm it up in my fingers before application.</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely with a foundation brush and a sponge applicator.</li>
      <li>Absolute best makeup..</li>
      <li>It was also very easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>It went on nicely and was SOO much better than the face makeup sold in Halloween stores.  </li>
      <li>Do make sure to use some kind of face moisturizer under the makeup as this helps it to come off easier.  </li>
      <li>Loved the face pant goes on smooth and lasted all night</li>
      <li>The opacity was terrific, it blended superbly, felt nice on.  </li>
      <li>The first day I used this it was great</li>
      <li>We did a trial run after getting it and it seems to work fine!</li>
      <li>I was the Voodoo Queen and this went on very smooth and stayed put.  </li>
      <li>Spreads nicely and is fairly opaque even on the first layer.</li>
      <li>Perfect product and use a good sponge wetted down.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the product.</li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t have rash or whatsoever :) stayed longer on my face, setting powder was not needed at all.</li>
      <li>The white was perfect for a costume I used it with.</li>
      <li>We also apply a layer of baby powder on top of this layer and it stayed all night.</li>
      <li>Love the creamy texture and the 2 oz container goes a loooong way.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to buy sealing powder along with this</li>
      <li>and it will stay on all day :)</li>
      <li>Best application requires at least 2 but otherwise great cover and color.</li>
      <li>More importantly, it didn&#x27;t crack or flake!  </li>
      <li>After receiving it I discovered it could be used for so much more.</li>
      <li>best white makeup I have EVER used.  </li>
      <li>As with most grease type makeup getting it off you must use some type of makeup remover.</li>
      <li>I need more tutorials dammit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great white base for makeup. PLEASE USE SPONGES THOUGH. this way it will apply evenly.</li>
    <li> Excited to use this product. Shipping was fast and it&#x27;s exactly what it says it is. Will use this seller again.</li>
    <li> Love it was perfect for the halloween season</li>
    <li> The first day I used this it was great it was on for 12+ hours and I hardly noticed at all; it didn&#x27;t really feel suffocating, didn&#x27;t smear unless I scratched at it. The second time using it was aweful; it was a shorter day (~10hrs) and it was melting off my face. I realized the top layer is the best part, the underlying makeup is a lot thinner but if you&#x27;re not having that long a day it&#x27;d probably be  fine. Overall used it thrice and have plenty to spare</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Covers completly, but remains sticky so you must use some sort of powder to set it.  I only used it for halloween, and it worked great on my face and looked really white.  To remove it, I had to wash my face with soap and water and then used oil to remove the remainig traces of white, with a warm wet soapy cloth, and repeated as needed.  Woke up and my face looks fine, so am not allergic to it, which is also a big problem for my skin.  Overall it is a fine product.  I tried applying it with a brush but did not work for me, so I used a makeup sponge, you may need several sponges.</li>
    <li> Really thick and white - perfect. After applying we dusted some baby powder on like makeup powder and it helped to dry and set the white face paint so you could apply other colors over it. Loved it, no complaints</li>
    <li> Product received quickly and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> It is legit face paint! Make sure to have plenty baby wipes</li>
    <li> I live in swamp humidity of New Orleans, and I like to play dress up like any local. This make is the best coverage and stay on power of any makeup. I go full sugar and march in parades at very hot conditions and this makeup stays strong. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Absolute best makeup..I barely used any and I did makeup three times during Halloween time, great coverage..definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Spreads nicely and is fairly opaque even on the first layer. Best application requires at least 2 but otherwise great cover and color. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> You do not need to use a lot and it has great coverage.</li>
    <li> It worked really well!</li>
    <li> My son did his first cosplay adventure as the Heath Ledger Joker. This helped make it happen!</li>
    <li> Never dried. Stayed sticky. Even with the separate &amp;#34;staying&amp;#34; powder</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much. It did end up coming off after a long Halloween night but stayed on for most of the night. Good product.</li>
    <li> really thick. not a fan - but then again, I don&#x27;t ever use face paints and makeup so maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use/apply this</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It went in smooth and a little went a long way.</li>
    <li> Works great and stays in place</li>
    <li> Received on time and intact</li>
    <li> Good product! Works well!</li>
    <li> After several hours of wear it does start to flake a little if you put on a thick coat. Very white and did a great job for my Harley Quinn costume.</li>
    <li> Had to play with it a little bit to get it just right and not look super caky, but it worked great for my Harley Quinn Halloween outfit!!</li>
    <li> Products goes a long way</li>
    <li> I loved this. So much better than that liquid crap in a tube and stays all night if your careful not to touch it.</li>
    <li> No clown should be without this stuff. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I want to love this stuff because I know it can provide great coverage when used correctly and in conjunction with other products, but its so temperamental! I&#x27;ve only had success using it with my hands (which I hate). One application went well, the second was streaking and blotchy because it was a warmer day. The first application was using one type of setting powder (Mehron maybe? Not sure...) but the second I used a different kind and all I managed was a blotchy, cakey disaster (setting powder from the makeup store). I need more tutorials dammit. Because I suspect a high user error factor, I&#x27;m only docking one star but I wish this came with some sort of instruction!</li>
    <li> Great coverage, more than enough product for the price. Will definitely use this again next Halloween, for myself and my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> I was afraid that 2 oz would not be enough as I was playing the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland and needed to cover alot.  But I hardly put a dent into the container after two shows. Do make sure to use some kind of face moisturizer under the makeup as this helps it to come off easier.  I had some come off onto my costume during the play and later learned that if I had used some kind of face powder on top of the makeup, it would not have come off as easily.  Some suggested baby powder as a cheap way to set it.  But this stuff is great. I could be as white or light as needed, depending on the amount put on.  Put on with my fingers, used a makeup brush to smooth our and get into the crack of the ears and eyes, etc.</li>
    <li> This is excellent face paint. Stays on and doesn&#x27;t bother the skin.</li>
    <li> Worked quite well. I used it for a Mardi Gras party. I was the Mad Hatter from combo of Royal Ballet version and Depp version. Skin had no reaction. Stayed on well and easily removed.</li>
    <li> I feel like it&#x27;s too greasy for my oily face but i did use it on my husband. It worked well, just a bit of work for blending it out</li>
    <li> The cream like formula provided full coverage lasted me all day with only one touch up (and that was only to fix how it had settled into the lines around my mouth and eyes from smiling so much). Eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t go over the formula too well, but I&#x27;m sure this problem could be fixed using a cream based eyeshadow. Its thick enough that only a couple coats was enough to completely cover my skin. The only real downside is that it can be a bit hard to remove, but still, baby wipes were enough to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This white make up was perfect for my daughters dance competition dance.  She needed white face make up.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> My brother and I go to charity events as super heroes. We needed white makeup and stumbled upon this. I thought it was a powder, but it&#x27;s more of a thick &amp;#34;compressed&amp;#34; creme. In any case, this stuff is brilliant. We used very little and are thinking it will last many, many events!</li>
    <li> Worked wonderful,covers well and spreads easy.</li>
    <li> I have never used this kind of makeup before and it worked great with my costume! It does give you a bit of trouble to take it off but you can applied it very easily!</li>
    <li> I think it should say somewhere that you will never stop feeling sticky with this.... hair will stick to your face and create streaks as you pull it off... anything touching your face will do that, so your face better not itch, either (which is unlikely when you&#x27;re wearing makeup that feels sticky). It was also pretty impossible to blend with any other makeup, of course. It was annoying and I felt gross the entire time wearing it. The coverage isn&#x27;t very full, either. I was quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> It dosen&#x27;t even out at all like it should, I don&#x27;t suggest buying this product. It&#x27;s the first time I bought this makeup brand.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome!! It goes on nicely with a foundation brush and a sponge applicator. Put ever so slightly a bit of baby powder to set it and you can use brushes to apply colored powders around the eyes or whatnot. It came off well with soap and water</li>
    <li> We did &amp;#34;Catz&amp;#34; for our dance recital this year, and I was a white and neon cat. This makeup was great, I got good coverage, and it really did not take much; I did 3 full applications, and I still have a LOT left over. I&#x27;m not experienced with putting on face paint like this, so I had a bit of trouble, but after reading some other reviews, I decided to do a rough application with my fingers, then go back with my foundation brush and smooth it out a bit. I also used baby powder with a powder brush to set it, and didn&#x27;t have any problems with a greasy feeling or rubbing off on my costume. I was able to easily apply my other makeup over top of it, and it lasted a good 5 hours, from getting ready for the performance, to our actual performance, and pictures afterwards. It was HOT, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I was sweating it off or like it was getting runny or anything. Finally, I used baby wipes to take most of it off, and some makeup wipes to get the rest, but it came off pretty easily. Overall, I think this is great, and I&#x27;ll definitely use it again for costumes!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. If you want it dark go over it a couple times</li>
    <li> I bought this to paint our faces for an NFL game (Yeah, we are THOSE fans!), and it worked great! It didn&#x27;t crack, fade, or peel on me. We wore it for about 12 hours. It stayed creamy and moist on my face. Its actually a little tough to get off (try baby oil). The size of the jar is pretty big, too. We painted four faces in complete makeup and we STILL have a massive amount left over. Ive tried to paint my face before with those little tubs of Halloween makeup, and this is far superior.</li>
    <li> This face paint is not bad at all. You get quite a nice amount and the color was great! By the time I was done, it looked like I wiped the surface a few times. There is still ALOT left! I am very satisfied with my purchase. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to paint their face white (for a play or for Halloween).</li>
    <li> This was PERFECT for my Mad Moxxi cosplay. Pair it with the Mehron setting powder and you can put other makeup on top of it like eye shadow. It doesn&#x27;t wipe off if you set it with the powder and isn&#x27;t runny, it&#x27;s just a little sticky, but spreads on perfectly with a little makeup sponge. Would recommend for mimes, clowns, goth makeup, etc.</li>
    <li> Used it for Halloween as a base and it was great.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Paired with the Mehron setting powder, my son&#x27;s face stayed perfectly white for hours...even in the drizzling rain.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love it,the makeup looks great</li>
    <li> This makeup worked perfect for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume.  I am not sure how well it works for application as clown makeup.  I would image you would have to apply the makeup much thicker than what I did for my daughter.  I only applied using my finger.  I should say she went as a zombie girl for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply applied one light coat with my finger, and then using a blush/bronzer blush added some black eye shadow to her eye area, under her checks, and jaw line.  She looked pretty creepy when I was finished with her.  She wore it for a good 5 to 6 hours and had not complaints of itching or sweating.  When I removed it with makeup remover there was no redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The underlying clown white makeup was a perfect base coat for the black eye shadow and I definitely would buy it again.  I will be using it again next Halloween.  My daughter is done with being a princess.  Oh how they grow up so fast.</li>
    <li> Love it, but don&#x27;t forget to buy the Mehron makeup remover. Even dish soap doesn&#x27;t Crack this stuff, haha.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the product. I did 3 faces with it and it looks great! I didn&#x27;t even need to use that much of it. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Very creamy and easy to apply. We also apply a layer of baby powder on top of this layer and it stayed all night. Great makeup</li>
    <li> Scent free, professional grade makeup, easy to apply, good coverage, comes off with soap or make up remover.</li>
    <li> The white was perfect for a costume I used it with.</li>
    <li> hard to apply, hate it, wont be using this again.</li>
    <li> Product worked exactly as expected. My son wanted to be Jeff the killer for Halloween. I used this, some black makeup around the eyes, liquid latex for the Chelsea smile, and some blood gel. The effect was pretty creepy.</li>
    <li> Worked great for our Halloween costumes. Definitely full coverage that lasted all night.</li>
    <li> Stays on all day, and comes off easily. No irritation for sensitive skin either.</li>
    <li> Good quality, doesn&#x27;t run down with sweat, very smooth and rich.</li>
    <li> A bit thick and heavy. I used it for a stage makeup class so it served my purposes, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it again if I had a choice.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Halloween costume. It’s very easy to apply and easy to come off. It actually last for hours. What made me buy it was everyone’s rating and comments.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. They provide TONS of makeup and holds very well with the addition of powder. I&#x27;m super stoaked that I have more to use later. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a very bright white, opaque, thick, creamy, smooth makeup. It blends well with other makeup, including concealer - if you cannot find a shade light enough, and even lipstick - to make pastel lip colors!</li>
    <li> Originally I ordered this for my Harley Quinn cosplay. After receiving it I discovered it could be used for so much more. Shipping speed was great. I have dark skin and the product turns my face completely white.</li>
    <li> Great makeup. Does not runs.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve painted our faces, in the past, for various parties, holidays, and running events, but usually used the cheap face paint from the party store. Those paints often ran with sweat and caused breakouts on my girlfriend&#x27;s sensitive skin (her skin is quite fair, and mine is quite oily, so we&#x27;re a bit of a challenge when ti comes to face makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We chose this paint because it seemed to have good reviews overall and the ingredients indicated it was lead free (Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Beeswax, Ozokerite, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Lanolin, Titanium Dioxide (main white color), Talc.) It wasn&#x27;t the cheapest, but it seemed to be used by a lot of professionals and that was good enough for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paint goes on light and even- for anyone who hasn&#x27;t done a full face paint, especially with white, before- be patient, layer it on, it will blend beautifully. You will want to pick up a finishing powder here on Amazon to dust your final application with to help prevent bleeds and sweat throughs, especially if you plan on putting colors over it. It will feel tacky upon first application but dries quite smooth in about 20 minutes. For those worried about the 2 oz, it goes very far- we have done 5 full face applications (and most covered the neck and chest) and it is still about half full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve worn the makeup for up to 7 hours on end with no allergic or sensitive skin issues and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled, we will be buying more for our upcoming 5ks this fall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Best tip use Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes, one wipe removes half a face of full makeup and is very gentle on skin!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Halloween and I always have a problem with the white base. This is the best that i have ever used but, just apply it quickly it drys up fast but the finish is amazing !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I did have a slight reaction to it.  Overall though I liked it!  Just make sure to buy sealing powder along with this and it will stay on all day :)</li>
    <li> Loved the face pant goes on smooth and lasted all night</li>
    <li> When used with their setting powder it works wonderfully, it doesn&#x27;t crack or run and it lasts all day. I did my daughter&#x27;s and my face as cats at 8 am and mine still looked the same as when I did it when I was getting ready to take my shower at 10 pm. My 2 year old daughters I did and stages because of her age and by the end of the day it was smudged from eating and wiping her face and rubbing her eyes but that is to be expected with any make up. We didn&#x27;t just stay home either we walked to the store, went shopping and even went out to eat in it. I got a bunch of comments on our costumes and make up. People loved it and wanted to know where I got it done. The powder also helps with sweating which was nice on that very hot walk to the store, so if you are going to be under hot lights on a stage or out in the middle of summer for LARP or Cosplay you will be fine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Apply a little or apply a lot depending on the coverage you want. You can get away by using just a tad. I thought the 2 oz would not be enough for two people and I was way wrong. I still have a ton left for many many more white faces!</li>
    <li> Perfect product and use a good sponge wetted down. A little provides a lot of coverage. We will use this brand again next year. All my daughters friends wanted to borrow it. Moves easier on the skin than the cheap stuff in the set at local stores.</li>
    <li> Exactly as it says, looks as it says. Very nice!</li>
    <li> stayed on all night and easy to get off.I have extremely sensitive skin and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Great! It didn&#x27;t dry out at all! And it worked good for my sensitive skin. It only took two coats to get pure white results! Amazing. Be careful though because it will get on anything that touches it because it doesn&#x27;t ever dry. *You need to use a setting powder* overall very happy</li>
    <li> I needed this for a costume &amp; didn&#x27;t want to use the same greasy makeup from the Halloween stores &amp; heard great things about it. I was so surprised how little I had to use for good coverage. Didn&#x27;t feel heavy at all, rather like I had nothing at all. To make it last longer, I set it with translucent powder. Lasted me all night, no smudging or smearing.</li>
    <li> I would probably use a water-based paint in the future, because I found this to be very thick and difficult to apply. That said, once the application was on it lasted me throughout the entire day with no touchups. I added a bit of water to the paint to help thin it a little for easier application, which helped some. It was slightly thin in areas, but it looked fine in photos and overall I was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Awful, doesn&#x27;t even fully cover your face. You&#x27;ll be left with white streaks</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my halloween costume and it worked great, much better than those little kits you can buy at the stores locally. It applied very easily and blended exceptionally well, it also held on throughout the night. I had to put my costume together 3 nights in a row for a halloween party, concert, and another party, and each time it went on easier and came off without a problem using makeup removal wipes. Got compliments throughout each night on the get up so I wasn&#x27;t the only one that thought it looked good.</li>
    <li> The makeup was fine , would like a few more suggestions on applying. Delivered right on time , Thanks</li>
    <li> Great makeup. I use this while working at a haunted house. The best thing about this type of makeup is it is long lasting and won&#x27;t melt off your face halfway through the night. Unless you are an excessive sweater. It takes a bit of work to get it all even on your face but just have patience. It is bright bright white. I usually add in some black to make a grey. This is a great base for many many different makeup uses. As with most grease type makeup getting it off you must use some type of makeup remover. I start by washing my face with a cleansing face soap, then removing the leftovers with a makeup remover/ face wipe cotton ball. I did not notice any reactions or irritation to my skin from this product, I have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> best white makeup I have EVER used.  Great coverage and doesn&#x27;t streak</li>
    <li> I used this for a female Jack Skellington costume at Disney&#x27;s Not So Scary Halloween Party. In the Florida heat, humidity, and with oily skin, this stuff stayed on pretty well. I reapplied to my nose maybe twice throughout the whole night. I used baby powder to set the makeup and it worked just fine. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way. I hardly used any to cover my entire face and chest area. If I ever run out, I will be buying this again. :)</li>
    <li> If you want to hide all of your skin and be white as a ghost. This is it. I am black. And it make me solo white.</li>
    <li> worked great, i was able to blend with other make up to create different tones. It applied very evenly and did not clump. Removed with cold cream and alittle scrubbing.</li>
    <li> hard to get on, hard to take off</li>
    <li> Came quick and works great!!</li>
    <li> I loved it! My whole family was able to use it too and we had plenty left! (5 of us)</li>
    <li> This stuff was great.  It barely came off all night.  Though I suggest getting some colorless powder to use along with it.  I bought 2 packs thinking it wouldn&#x27;t last long but, after painting 2 faces for 3 parties we just made a small debt in the product.  I attached a photo of how much product was left after painting 6 faces. Impressive!</li>
    <li> This makeup worked great for my Halloween costume!  I was the Voodoo Queen and this went on very smooth and stayed put.  It was also very easy to remove.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with [[ASIN:B00247XPYU Mehron Fantasy FX Makeup 1 oz Grey]] to achieve a black-and-white look for my silent film actress costume.  It was fantastic!  The opacity was terrific, it blended superbly, felt nice on.  I sealed it with baby powder, and while I didn&#x27;t achieve a perfect seal, the paint didn&#x27;t rub off too much.  More importantly, it didn&#x27;t crack or flake!  It washed right out of my clothes (satin gloves, velvet dress) and off of my eyeglasses.  It did take some elbow grease to remove it from my face/body, but I just used an exfoliating facial cleanser with a wash cloth.  Makeup remover might help.  I did not break out from using this, and I am prone to breakouts.</li>
    <li> The makeup does exactly as advertised: gives you a thick, bright white coating that does not dry out at all even over several hours. The makeup is very comfortable, and it&#x27;s possible to even forget you have it on. However,  one downside that I presume is tied to it &amp;#34;not drying&amp;#34; is that it will very easily rub off on anything it touches, especially clothing. Makeup used on your neck or jaw is very likely to end up in splotches on your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the makeup does take some effort to remove. Simply washing in warm water will not take off most of the paint, I would recommend using makeuup-removing pads or other scrubbing tools to get it off of your face.</li>
    <li> I hate this product! I would never recommend it and will never buy it again. It is too difficult to work with. I will say in defense of the company - it is creamy and not greasy. BUT, that&#x27;s the only positive I found.&lt;br /&gt;I could not make the application, the color, even on the face - no matter what I did. It had blotches all over, and I could not construct a smooth palate to work with - an essential for a great looking make-over. In attempt to fix the problem I naturally applied more. Didn&#x27;t work. I tried thinning it out with a sponge, and it wiped most of it off in one little stroke. I tried to warm it up in my fingers before application. Nope. I tried to thin it out with a little water on my fingers. Nope. I tried circle application, applying with an upward motion, applying with a downward motion. Still no smooth application.&lt;br /&gt; At that point after working with it for 30 minutes and really trying to figure it out I gave up and swore it off. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but if a foundation and powder is that difficult to work with - it is not worth my time or effort. It should go on smoothly the first time straight out of the tub and take little effort to blend.&lt;br /&gt; I will try Ben Nye&#x27;s product next (another great theatrical line) and hope for a better, easier result. Seriously, if anyone knows how to work with this product and get a perfectly smooth foundation I would really love to know how you do it. For the time it took me to try - I rate this product a NO WAY!</li>
    <li> I used this face paint for my halloween costume. This is a really thick white cream, not like the cheap, thin, runny stuff you get in those halloween makeup kits. My white face lasted all day. You will need to apply a couple of layers to get that nice bright white face, but it will certainly last. I removed one star because I did have a few small breakouts after using this cream.</li>
    <li> I had initially been using the Ben Nye clown cake, but I guess I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make it work correctly because it was so terribly streaky. This stuff is great! Love the creamy texture and the 2 oz container goes a loooong way. You can keep gradually building to make it as opaque as you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s cream makeup, there is the risk of major creasing, especially around the eye area. I used regular old makeup primer before applying this on the face and then set it with translucent powder afterwards, which did the trick. It stayed in place and didn&#x27;t smudge onto anything.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m not a clown, second I&#x27;m not a actor or anything like it.&lt;br /&gt;This past is good for basic stuff, but it&#x27;s very hard to mix it with other paint, it very hard to make it not keep the past consistency and everything you touch will turn white.&lt;br /&gt;Also its hard to remove FROM EVERYTHING, that includes your skin!</li>
    <li> Bought for halloween and wore it all day at work.  Wasn&#x27;t itchy, didn&#x27;t get crackly and was surprisingly light weight. I didn&#x27;t go very heavy with it, so maybe that helped, but it is the best face paint I&#x27;ve found for full face application.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have rash or whatsoever :) stayed longer on my face, setting powder was not needed at all. Im happy with this product and will purchase more next time!</li>
    <li> Mehron, as always, has pretty much become my favorite white face paint. Covers well and stays on pretty well throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This was bought for the purpose of  Mime Dancing in the church. It last very long as they are dancing it spreads evenly.</li>
    <li> I had fun with this! I barely used any of it and I covered 2 faces. It is very thick, and I have learned that to avoid the perspiration, if you add  BIT OF BABY POWDER TO YOUR FACE, before and after or during application, it does allow the look a more lasting protection. It does still rub off even after it sets. It took a bit of work to get it off, soap and water and baby wipes definitely did the trick. But I love it! Can&#x27;t wait to do use it again.</li>
    <li> It is interesting that I see so many reviews for actually painting your face white.I bought this for my wife becauseof an old trick learned when I was in the beauty biz. Funny that I know tricks that my former model wife doesn&#x27;t know. Opposite sides the business I guess. Anyway, use this by taking a tiny dot and cover over dark areas like under the eyes before applying foundation for a more even coloration of the face. This is a good brand.</li>
    <li> Mehron is definitely a good recommended make-up for those who try to be clowns. Thanks .</li>
    <li> We have always used eyebrows (glue on kind) for my husband who plays SANTA ever year at my preschool.... but they get in the way of his glasses and turn yellow from the glue required and can be used only once... so that gets expensive... gonna use this on his eyebrows with a eyebrow comb and some baby powder to hold it.... Let you know how that works!  We did a trial run after getting it and it seems to work fine!</li>
    <li> this product really works for the goth make up. I can sweat and dance for hours, come home and still have a lot of it still on my face. Worth the money. This is the super white color for the clown and goth make up FYI.</li>
    <li> This makeup goes on great and doesn&#x27;t run off with perspiration!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Harley Quinn cosplay. I made it work, but I certainly will not be using it again. Would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Expensive... For actually ONE bottle.&lt;br /&gt;  Disappointed but too busy to return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a day of the dead festival I attended. I did my make up, as well as my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s. It lasted the entire evening, without smudging. I used a beauty blender sponge to apply. Very little went A VERY LONG WAY. i would say a dime size amount is more than enough for an entire face and neck. It looked great, not streaky or heavy feeling. Even my son said it was comfortable. I would recommend settting it with powder, but i recommend that with anything cream/ liquid you are applying to the skin. Great purchase, at a great price. Now to figure out how to keep it seal and fresh since it seems like i will have it for a VERY long time. :)</li>
    <li> It stays on for hours and does not smear. It is easy to blend other make up over the top. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for Halloween make up. It went on smooth &amp; didn&#x27;t try out or make cracks. It was also easy to remove at the end of the night.</li>
    <li> It went on nicely and was SOO much better than the face makeup sold in Halloween stores.  I did not have to use much to cover my face and you can get a much more even look that those other products.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  We used it for our 11 year old when she dressed up as a French Mime in a Christmas play (don&#x27;t ask...)</li>
    <li> I used this product for my Harley Quinn cosplay. It was a little thick and pretty sticky and I expected it to be a bit more smooth for a Mehron product. My face broke out in many places after using this for a few hours. Overall I enjoyed it though and it did it&#x27;s job! I never sweat off the product. Maybe I will just put it on a little lighter next time. :)</li>
    <li> I have been a die hard KISS fan since day one, and every Halloween I always dress as Gene Simmons. It would be cheap and easy to just buy a mask, and wear that. However, since I am trying to be as authentic as possible, I always use real makeup - just as the real KISS does. I have tried many different brands of white makeup over the years (mostly from seasonal Halloween shops). They&#x27;re ok and look fairly decent, but most of them began cracking (even with white setting powder). So one year, I decided to try Mehron&#x27;s Clown White Makeup - and I am glad I did! It goes on easy, looks great (provided, of course, that you spread it evenly), and - at least in my case - does not crack, even with the setting powder on. I wouldn&#x27;t say it comes off super-easy (as in 30 seconds or so). But I have never had any difficulty removing it (as some users have), in a fairly quick amount of time. This brand of white makeup costs a little more, than what you&#x27;d find in a costume store somewhere. But in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth it. Ever since the first time I started using this brand, I have never used anything else!</li>
