      <li>I love the Sirius Nova Advanced Rejuvenation System!  </li>
      <li>However when I researched the science and I found that having it as close you your face as possible gives the best result (I rest it against my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The red light head already has bulbs burnt out, can&#x27;t get the blue light to connect properly.  As a product the concept of light therapy works nicely.  Just can&#x27;t say this product will last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for years, even when I went into college. You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d stop after a while, but it just didn&#x27;t! I saw this in a store in the mall and since I had a little extra spending money I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; and I ended up being so enthralled with this thing! I mostly use it for acne, but it&#x27;s made such noticeable changes that my mom keeps trying to snag it from me to help with some dark spots on her face (I think it&#x27;s sun damage.) and I noticed it really worked for her too. I haven&#x27;t tried out any settings except for the blue light that&#x27;s supposed to help acne, but seeing that it&#x27;s worked for both me and my mom I&#x27;m pretty impressed. If you&#x27;re struggling with acne or sun damage I really suggest this thing, with diligent use it had me almost perfectly clear-faced after years of dealing with acne.</li>
    <li> Still some issues with it. The light heads are flickering and this is very annoying. Other wise my skin starts to look better.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughters and they love them!</li>
    <li> Liked the product but too time consuming to use. The micro current must do something because when I turned it on....my dog would leave the room. Don&#x27;t know if it emits a high pitch sound or what.....but he didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in acne after using it a few weeks every other day. Maybe I need to use it longer. It takes about 25 minutes to do my face with just the blue light. I really wanted to try it so it was worth it to me, but if you are short on cash I dont think this is worth it. I still had new pimples come up when I was using it, and that seems to me that its not really killing bacteria. I cleaned it with alcohol pads in between uses so thats not the problem.</li>
    <li> Still no results will keep it updated. I&#x27;ve stopped use because I&#x27;ve suddenly gotten high levels of acne.  Will update review once improvement seen</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only been using the sirius nova for two weeks. already, i feel my skin is much more clear, fresh, and smooth. a gal pal of mine just got one, too. we&#x27;re both on the cusp of landmark birthdays. id go so far as to say it&#x27;s taken years off my appearance and the way my face feels. she (who is ten years my senior) has the same feedback. my biggest skin issue is hyper-pigmentation, which im hoping will begin to clear up with regular use. even if it doesn&#x27;t, im still incredibly impressed by the overall texture and feel of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;a lot of reviews mention the time. yes. its a process and requires some dedication. but if you can find a way to make it a ritual.. reading, or something innocuous.. you owe yourself some quiet time, regardless.</li>
    <li> Color me skeptical when it comes to these types of products, because I never thought light would be able to do anything with my skin besides bring out my flaws. I only bought this under the insistent recommendation of a friend and growing concern about the lines forming on my forehead. Not only have the lines noticeably reduced, but I’m also using it now to treat my acne!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much change or benefits from this. I feel like I wasted money.</li>
    <li> Have not used it long enough to determine if I will get expected results.</li>
    <li> I purchased the system in Jan. and have been using it for a month now and it works fantastic.  Three family members are using it for different skin conditions. My mother is using the red head for her deep wrinkles and the green head for age spots and I have seen the wrinkles starting to diminish and become softer. I use the galvanic &amp; microcurrent  head to cleanse, nourish and lift &amp; tone, then use the red head for wrinkles.  My son used the blue head for acne and what a difference in his skin-my goodness-this beats any acne meds by far. The green,red and blue head has a cycle time of 3 minutes and hold it on that one area of the face,  so it can take some time to do your whole face but it&#x27;s worth it. It does not pulsate on the skin it just lights up.  The galvanic head has a cycle time of 4 min for each treatment cycle(cleanse, nourish and lift &amp;tone). Unlike the other colored heads, this head can glide around your whole face and you use your own skin cream and serum or moisturizer with the head. So easy to use and will continue to use for another month. Love my skin and you will too with time and patience.  If you have deep wrinkles expect some time to see results, but it will happen. You will have beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old and I really take care of my skin, I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I already see difference. People are complimenting my skin, saying how I look younger and how smooth my skin looks. I count on this product to keep me forever young :)</li>
    <li> I love this thing it really works! Do you want ten years off your face? Buy this. Follow instructions and take the time.You can use it on the lights settings around eyes and mouth just like Silkin but a little less money and you get more features. I bought it for a little sagging on the eyelids,lines around the eyes,sun damage(sun spots) living in Florida it is inevitable and scarring on the upper lip from younger days getting electrolosis. I noticed immediate improvement the next day and every time I used it after. I have had this since the last week of February and its only March and the scarring that nothing worked on is 85-90% better,the sagging eyelids almost totally fixed and the crows feet are almost gone.The sun spots are at least 70% better and my whole face has a plumper beautiful glow that my husband noticed right away. Thank God for Amazon because I didn&#x27;t even know this thing existed.It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had blemish and acne spots left over for years and now with age I developed fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes. Overall, my skin tone and texture were extremely uneven. I came across this rejuvenating system and decided to give it a go because I desperately needed to rectify the situation. I started using them and I was quite amazed at how it worked for me. Within a week I started noticing my spots getting lighter and wrinkles becoming less and less deep. I was so happy to see such great results I hadn&#x27;t been able to achieve with anything else before. It truly does cleanse and nourish your skin and you start looking less dull and much more glowy/healthy. This system is amazing!</li>
    <li> Poor/RUDE customer service and a not so great product &#x3D; not happy and definitely do not recommend. Save your money up for the Tria brand.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great.</li>
    <li> I have been reading extensively on light therapy before I decided to buy this product for me and my wife to help us take some years of damages off our faces. I bought this because of all the good reviews I saw on here and wanted to give this a try to remove some of my face wrinkles because cream didn&#x27;t do much for me. Wow am I impressed with the results I get from this. I was able to almost eliminate all of my wrinkles at the corner of my eyes and I notice an overall tightness of my skin. I have been using this too for the bags under my eyes and it helped a lot. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product works.  Read all of the reviews on here to find suggestions in how to use it most effectively.  The surface area is smaller than some other lights, but it&#x27;s important to mention that the number of lights and the close placement of them makes for a more powerful exposure than the masks or lights used from a distance.  Still, I usually will do 2 cycles of the red and blue at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service was responsive to me when my unit stopped charging, and sent me a replacement within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- Take care not to run your unit while it&#x27;s plugged in, this can allow it to overheat itself.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to my facial routine.  It has helped so much and makes my skin feel toned and smooth.  I have not yet seen the final results, but cannot wait!</li>
    <li> Shipping was really slow but I got it. Was skeptical of galvanic cleansing but it&#x27;s awesome! Skin is so smooth afterwards. Feels great. Have been using the micro current. Used it with regular moisturizer first several sessions. Noticed a huge change when I started spritzing my face with water then putting a drop of water based lube on the micro current head. I could tell my skin at the corner of my mouth and smile lines improving. Well worth the money. I have just been using the red light to promote healing on a few slow healing areas I have. Really can&#x27;t say for sure how that&#x27;s going as it is something that takes time.</li>
    <li> Much better and more durable than its predecessor (a different brand).</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it that long, but it seems to be working properly.  Hopefully, it will do what it claims to do if I use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> have not had for very long and do not use as much as I would like to basically you know how life is  I really bought this cause of the galvanic feature....honestly I &#x27;m kind of still not sure if it is actually doing anything at all  but all in all its cool  my face does seem to be looking better  I&#x27;m in my 40s still breeak out  have scars and sensitive skin  this product hasn&#x27;t disagreed with my skin at all  looking for the right products to use with it</li>
    <li> Still a little early to tell but I am pretty sure I can tell a difference on my age spots.  I do seem to be having an issue with keeping one of the light on.  The process is long and tedious but I think it will be worth it if I can find the time to use a few times a week.</li>
    <li> Great idea and nice  unit.  Beautiful package.  But the sensor did not work so even though it was touching the skin, it would go in an out. Had to hold it on with one hand, while using with the other. Sent it back.  Amazon was great though.</li>
    <li> Great functions as light therapy and for the micro/galvization portion. I went to school for 10 months to learn all the functions of the skin. I graduated from a nationally known esthetic program years back. It&#x27;s really nice to see a non commercial unit work as well as this does. With continued use, I believe I will get near spa like results at home. Highly recommend to women of all ages.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t drop $150 for something I didn&#x27;t expect to work...but at the same time, I guess I did kind of drop $150 for something that I didn&#x27;t expect would work that well.  Whew, thankfully I was extremely surprised.  Two days into the regimen, yes two, and my face is noticeably (in people terms as in my brother noticed, not advertising terms as in it&#x27;s noticeable if you squint your eyes, tilt your head, and stand in the perfect lighting) brighter and smoother.  I&#x27;m still in disbelief that something could work so quickly.  I&#x27;ve used...countless products to treat my eczema and dry skin, and this glow stick of a facial has done more for me in 2 days than any of it has in my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system itself is a bit time-consuming, but I&#x27;ve been using it while watching Netflix so it goes by quickly.  I was a bit worried when I first read the instructions- I have very dry skin, so forgoing moisturizer for 20ish minutes after cleaning my face (You use the lights before you use the nourish/lift functions which are paired with your own serum and anti-wrinkle cream) went against everything I&#x27;ve ever been taught by my dermatologist.  But, by the end of the whole ordeal, my face was as smooth as butta and remained smooth through the next day.  Also, the little pimples that I get on my forehead and nose after sweating at the gym are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Clean/Nourish/Lift functions are used with your own products.  For a cleansing product, the instructions state that there should be no micro-beads (etc) or light reflecting ingredients that would make the LED component less effective.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good product to make my skin glow. I am happy I found Sirus Nova, I love this product. I can see the difference it does for my skin. It works great for me and my skin has good looking results. My skin is more clean and glowing. I feel better about myself after using this system. It really cleaned and repaired my skin very good. I recommend that everyone gets this product for their skin.</li>
    <li> I was actually searching for laser hair removal and stumbled across this thing! I&#x27;ve seen the TV commercials for a similar product. I did a bit of research and read a lot of promising things about LED Light Therapy. I just turned 39 and have noticed quite the wrinkles, crows feed, droopy eye lids etc. So I figured, let&#x27;s give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to decide between the Aurora and the Nova. I found several reviews about the Aurora and even some review videos. Unfortunately, I did not find much about the Nova at all. I guess cause it is still a rather new product. I really liked the fact that this was cordless though. The Aurora had plenty of great reviews and I figured that it can&#x27;t be that big of a difference, considering its the same company. Therefore, I decided to cough up the extra $50 and go for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was not the fastest, but it arrived in the estimated time. :) It came in a blank white box with the manual booklet. From the picture here, I assumed that the light heads were color coded. They are not. They all look the same! I just stuck a piece of tape on the back of each and wrote the color on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people like me --- that can&#x27;t wait to get it out of the box and turn it on without reading the instructions first --- the light will only come on when the light head touches your skin! I thought it was broke at first, cause the light would flicker if I touched the head, but then turned back off when I moved my hand! Took me a minute to realize that it is sensitive to the touch! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I watched review videos for the Aurora, the ladies said to move the light head in circles across your face. The Nova says to keep the light still in the same spot. Hmmmm that&#x27;s a bit of a drawback. The light heads are sort of small and I don&#x27;t know if the light will also have any effect on my skin surrounding the treated area. (If anyone knows please let me know) For now I just have to move it from one spot to the next. Its abit more time consuming. I have to do about 10-11 areas with each light. Each session is 3 minutes. That means about 30 minutes treatment for each light. I also noticed that the battery died on me when I did red light, then blue light. I was able to finish the blue light, but at the last area it shut off. I guess that is a drawback of cordless :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use it 5 days a week for the first 2 month, then use it 3 days a week to keep it going. Right now I do mainly the red light. Would like to do red and blue, but due to the time and battery I think I will just stick with red for the 2 month and when I am down to 3 x red a week then I will start the blue 5 x a week. The wrinkles and fine lines were my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this thing faithfully for exactly 2 weeks now in conjunction with Avon Anew kit!!! (Again, mainly the red --- I think I did blue two or 3 times.) I only used it on the right side of my face so I could compare to my left side! I couldn&#x27;t really see any major improvements when looking in the mirror. HOWEVER, I took some selfies 2 days ago and I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My right side had actually improved quite a bit! The smile lines have gotten better and most of all the droopy eyelid has improved!!! I could totally see that my right eye looks much more opened, where on my left eye the droopy eyelid makes my eye appear smaller! Crows feed seem to have improved as well. But the eye lid is the biggest improvement!!! I was actually very surprised and pleased with the result in such a short time! I sent the picture to 3 of my friends and asked them if they can see a difference of the right and left side of my face and they all pointed out that my right side looked younger! (They knew I used it on only one side, but they did not know which side I was using it on.) It made my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the GALVANIC MICROCURRENT head one time and it really made my face burn. :( Not sure ifit is supposed to do that or if I just need to use a different facial cleanser/lotion with it. I will play around with that again one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have mild psoriasis and want to see if this will help with that as well. Just have not had the time (or battery life) to do it faithfully yet. :D One thing at a time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret paying what I did for it, cause it really seems to work! I just do it while I am watching TV in the evening. The light doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I read that some use protective glasses, but the light is not that bright to me, plus I really want to be able to get to the area around my eyes (and watch TV lol). When I get to the area around my eyes, I do see the red light shimmer, but not to a point where it bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started doing both sides of my face now and hopefully my left side catches up to my right side! :D</li>
    <li> After 1 month, the device stops working now!  I only use it 1-2 time per week!</li>
    <li> WOW!! The Sirius Nova is a miracle! I use this on a regular basis on my face for my wrinkles and it definitely makes them vanish. My skin feels really smooth, like a baby&#x27;s! This product is worth the high price, trust me! The results you get are insanely too good to be true! I am so excited to keep using this and getting great results! I feel and look better!</li>
    <li> I struggle a lot with my skin and have tried product upon product to keep it a clear and healthy looking as I can. Some things work okay, but nothing has worked as well as this. The different colored lights help with different skin problems, which is great because I can specifically use the pimple one when I need it, which prevents my skin from drying out. The other two lights have helped a lot with reducing my wrinkles and making my face tighter overall. The one thing to remember though is YOU HAVE TO USE IT REGULARLY. Like any skin care regimen you have to keep up with it. Luckily it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this tools for my daughter. It took only 4 days, all the pimple on her forehead gone. Also I try it for myself, I noticed my skin is getting smooth. I have never thought this tools is really work, but it did it really do work for my daughter skin and me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a month ago for my sister. She had severe acne issues and wanted to try the Nova. She has been using it for some time now. Her acne has substantially improved and and her face looks much better now. It&#x27;s pretty easy to use - you just have to hold it for 3 minutes on affected areas. My sister loves it and she is very happy with it. I highly recommend this to everyone who has similar problems.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product, it had a defective red light.  It was quickly replaced.  After about 5 uses, the green light went out.  The instructions are horrible.  It is a tiny little book with tiny print.  Come on....older people are going to be buying this product.  Sent mine back today.  It is a shame too, because is really thought it was making a difference in my skin.  This company has serious quality issues.</li>
    <li> The best it works. It&#x27;s a must have if you have any flaw you want to repair</li>
    <li> The best product I have ever bought for my skin! I love the Sirius Nova Advanced Rejuvenation System!  Ever since I was a teenager I have been suffering from horrible acne and scarring and I have tried everything from creams, gels, scrubs, microdermabrasion, laser, and much more. Spending over $3000 in laser treatments and I can’t even begin to describe the amount of I spent on topical creams and such. Then one my girlfriends recommended to me the Sirius Nova Advanced Rejuvenation System and my skin as never been better! From the first time I used it I noticed my skin was softer and smoother. Its really easy and quick to use and noninvasive. After 2 weeks I noticed I was getting less acne and my scars were noticeably reduced! I have been using this product for over a month and a half now and I am so happy with my skin. I feel so much more confident when I go out and meet people and hang out with my friends and I love the fact that I don’t have to wear as much make up as I used to. My friends and family are noticing the results as well and I have been getting many compliments, I have been recommending this product to everyone that asks, its absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your like me and went through so many products to have beautiful skin and feeling hopeless all the time, you have to try Sirius Nova Advanced Rejuvenation System. I love it and highly recommend it! I wish I knew about it sooner!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but a few times - but my skin is soft and it does make acne cysts diminish in a few days.  I do not like the instruction booklet - seems it could have been written to be simpler - I had to read it 3-4 times to understand it - and you need a magnifying glass - the booklet and print is soooo small  C. Madere</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described. Like the galvanic/microcurrent feature the best. Basically it&#x27;s like having 5 products in 1 - galvanic, microcurrent, red, blue and green photofacials. I would suggest spending 5 to 10 minutes reading the manual first. The device has a bunch of functions and it&#x27;s useful to familiarize yourself with them instead of pressing random buttons.</li>
    <li> so far I can only say that I like it. too soon to know if it really works. As other reviewers have stated-it would have been easier if the heads were color coated. The battery seems to drain quickly. It is time consuming if a person has a lot of places to fix. 3-4 minutes in each area for each head. I try to do one color per day while working on computer ,difficult if you need your hands since you have to hold device, but  better than just sitting there waiting.&lt;br /&gt;After a few months I can review better because the bottom line is-does it do what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the wife, and she loves it.  I am going to buy one for every female family member for christmas!</li>
    <li> Alright, so I was holding off on writing a review because I don&#x27;t believe in an \\&quot;results overnight\\&quot; type of product--this, however, is pretty dang close.  I&#x27;ve tried it all--Restylane, Retin-A, skin rolling (very painful, by the way), AHA acid peels--you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. This is great because it&#x27;s non-invasive and non-abrasive--so you&#x27;re not going to walk around with peeling, flaking skin for a week after treatment.  And it&#x27;s essentially effortless--if you can sit there and hold the device to your face for a few minutes, you can treat your skin.  Also, it does work, folks--this is coming from a skeptic herself.  I use all the heads--the green for my sun spots, the blue for acne, and the red for overall firmness.  Let&#x27;s start with the blue--you get pretty quick results with this--my blemishes are on their way out by 12-18 hours later--much faster than without treatment.  The green light is supposed to help with sunspots....it took a lot of treatments before I saw results with my sun spots, but my biggest sun spot is breaking up and on its way out.  If you have issues with sun spots, I&#x27;d suggest treating the area twice as long as suggested, because it&#x27;s going to be a while before you see any results.  And finally, the red light--I definitely see results, as I look less tired.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but it has helped with the dark circles and bags as well.  I&#x27;d definitely give it a try--you really have nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: one of the heads is acting up--you have to push on it a certain way before it will light up.  That sucked.  But that considered, I recently had a scar on my face, and as you get older, your skin just doesn&#x27;t heal as quickly as it used to. Anyway, after using the green light on the spot, the peeling/flaking that comes along with healing skin has completely gone away and seriously--the healing time has sped up dramatically.  I don&#x27;t think this is a miracle treatment, but at least you will see results without the side effects of other harsh products.other harsh products.</li>
    <li> Have only used once so I&#x27;ll undate later, but received on time &amp; seems to be great quality</li>
    <li> The seller sent this quickly. It is very nice. We will see how I look soon. Thanks very much</li>
    <li> Got this for my acne issue and I am so relieved to say that it&#x27;s been working like a charm. I have low self esteem because of my acne and I have tried every single way to get rid of them. With this, it finally worked. I already see results and have I&#x27;ve only been using it for around a week.</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot. It&#x27;s easy to use, and it works. The only issue I had was I didn&#x27;t understand how to get it to work at first. The device only works when it is placed firmly against the face. I do believe the couple of spots on my face I am treating with the green light are fading. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Much stronger than my previous one. Works perfectly so far. Changing heads is kind of a hassle thou.</li>
    <li> I love this system. Since I suffer from adult cystic acne, I primarily use the red and blue lights. I can tell immediately after I use them that it works. I try to use them at least 4 times a week to keep my acne at bay. It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of my breakouts, but it greatly improves them along with my skin regimen. Within a couple months of continued use, the lights on both the red and blue heads have begun to sort of flicker in and out. It hasn&#x27;t bothered me at this point, but I will be sure to request new heads before the warranty runs out, but this is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars</li>
    <li> I struggled with acne my whole life. My biggest problem is clogged pores. I have used many products including prescription topical gels to get rid of acne. The only thing that helped before I got this gizmo was prescription topical gel. I bought Sirius Nova out of desperation. I would be lying if I say I was not skeptical. I&#x27;ve been using Sirius Nova almost everyday for about 2.5 weeks I think. I use galvanic and blue light. I remove makeup first and then apply regular cleanser and set the device to \\&quot;clean.\\&quot; Once I am done, I apply toner and move on to blue light. Blue light does shrink the size of a pimple and pimples tend to heal quicker. I have a bad habit of squeezing pimples and normally once I squeeze them, they get inflamed and angry and get bigger before they start to heal. When I used blue light on squeezed pimple, it stayed red but it never became inflamed or infected. It&#x27;s red but flat the next day and it seems to heal faster. After blue light, I use galvanic again to \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; with my antioxidant serum. I use retinol every 2-3 days after \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; step to help unclog pores.    I did some research on how galvanic works and I found out that you actually need to complete \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; step if you use \\&quot;clean\\&quot; step because \\&quot;clean\\&quot; step makes your skin alkaline (your skin is normally slightly acidic if I remember correctly) which leads to your skin becoming more fragile. \\&quot;Nourish\\&quot; step reestablishes normal pH of your skin so you must do both \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; steps.    One big change I noticed after using galvanic for almost 3 weeks is that the \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; I used to have on my cheeks and forehead are 99% gone. I ran my fingers on my face the other day and I was amazed at how smooth my skin was. I did not use \\&quot;lift\\&quot; step of galvanic so I can&#x27;t say much about that. Once my pimples are almost healed, I plan to use green light to see if it will help with freckles and sun spots on my face.    One things I don&#x27;t like about Sirius Nova is how the head is designed. It&#x27;s difficult to run the device around my nose. I have VERY stubborn blackheads on my nose and I was hoping to use Nova to help get rid of those ugly blackheads but it wasn&#x27;t successful. One of my friends have NuSkin galvanic spa and I like how the head of the device is designed. I wish Sirius would change the design of galvanic head. Oh, and battery ran out on me one time. It wasn&#x27;t really a big deal - make sure you fully charge Nova if you plan to use it for more than 30-45 minutes at one time.    All in all, I give Sirius Nova 5 stars because it lived up to its promise. But remember, I used Nova almost everyday. I am not sure if it will give you the same results if you use it 2-3/week. Sirius Nova + diligence on your part will give you good result. I hope my review helps.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I&#x27;m just too lazy to do this consistently but its a very good product.</li>
    <li> Not sure come back in a month</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a few days and I definitely notice a difference in my skin! I love it. It is so easy to use. That being said, the light is pretty bright, and I worry about it affecting my eyes. I think I am going to wear some eye protection. I only used it 4 times before the battery went out (each time I used it for about 30 minutes) so I will have to charge the batteries often. BUT you can&#x27;t beat the price. Light treatments are a fortune and it is well worth the money. I would definitely buy it again. In fact, I am thinking about buying another one for my mom...</li>
    <li> I only received my unit yesterday, so I am cautiously optimistic.  One thing I had no idea of is that it is very very time consuming if you want to do all the functions and lights in one sitting.  I am bummed out too that the battery died before I had finished the routine.  Now it&#x27;s plugged in and I have no idea how long it will take to recharge.  I&#x27;m excited most about the toning as well as the red light for fine lines.  Will update after a couple weeks...hopefully I will have good results to report!</li>
    <li> I got the Sirius Nova Rejuvenation System as a birthday gift a few weeks ago. I waited about a week and then decided to use it because I thought it was a &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; gift. It turns out that I lost out on that week I had it sitting on my dresser! I have always had a problem with acne, blemishes, and wrinkles seeing that I am now 40 years old. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and I have been using it since. I have a wedding to stand up in about a month from now and I can say that my face and neck are ready for this occasion. I have told my friends about this and have suggested that they buy it for themselves as well. The System is very easy to use and can be lugged around when I join my friends for &amp;#34;Girl&#x27;s night&amp;#34; facials.</li>
    <li> I use this while watching a show. It takes some time, but I&#x27;m unaware as I am focused on the movie. Multi-tasking.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I bought.  Gave my first to my daughter and she loves it.  I was glad to see on the Sirius I recently purchased has initialled stamped with a R, B, C on the reverse side to identify the colour led lights.  I used a magic marker to identify them previously.  I notice now that my skin is clearer with the age spots lightening and my face is firmer and glows.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if the minutes for each area being treated could be reduced, you have a sure winner for keeping your skin youthful and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery needs to last over an hour so you can do all the treatments in one sitting.</li>
    <li> I was using this primarily for the blue and green lights. I did notice less breakouts with the blue light. However, the green light had a few bulbs burn out pretty quickly (within 1 month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ok dealing with that, since there was still a lot of light coming out of the machine, but then, it became increasingly difficult for the sensor to detect that it was against my skin. It used to be SUPER easy, but now it&#x27;ll maybe detect 1 out of 4 times. And that wouldn&#x27;t even be that much of a problem if it STAYED on, but it wasn&#x27;t staying on, it&#x27;d just go off after about 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, bummer. I don&#x27;t use it anymore. So frustrating.</li>
    <li> Love it, already showing deminished color on my sun spots. Only down side is the surface size is relatively small thus requiring additional time for larger surface coverage.</li>
    <li> I have been using it 5 times a week waiting 24 hours on between , I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> Worked well while it lasted.  It broke by the end of the year, and I hadn&#x27;t used it in a very long time.  I went to go use it again one day and it just wast working anymore.  It&#x27;s made very cheaply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for a product that would help rejuvenate my skin and help reduce the appearance of my skin discoloration and dark spots, plus the wrinkles and scarring from my post-pregnancy acne. I had tried all of the commercial brand micro dermabrasion systems out there, but the LED photofacial therapy is something completely revolutionary all together. Completely worth the price and the time. Results are noticeable and you feel like the work you put in gives you just as much reward. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for fabulous results with the most cutting age technology!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this type of skincare from a friend at work, I gave it a try and it works pretty good. After 2 weeks, my skin seems to have a more youthful glow. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I didn&#x27;t experience any discomfort and I am seeing results.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! Since using this I have really noticed a difference in my skin. It makes my skin tighter and even makes it glow. It cleans my skin so I don’t break out and helps with anti aging. It looks younger and it seems to make wrinkles less noticeable. I’m not sure what it is doing exactly but I feel a lot prettier after using this product. I purchased this because it sounded like it would really work. It uses ions and light to clean and repair your skin. It was different than anything I’ve ever tried, and I’m glad I tried it because it works so well.</li>
    <li> This is the third system similar to this that I&#x27;ve tried, and Sirius is by far superior to the other manufacturers.  Even with the less-well-designed models, I saw a visible difference in my skin with use of the various lights, but the other designs were not cordless, only offered the three light-frequency heads, not the toning attachment, and both of them quit working in six months or less.  I&#x27;ve only had the Sirius for a couple of months, so I don&#x27;t know if it will last longer than the other models, but its performance is already so much better and more comfortable, I&#x27;d re-buy it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;  So what&#x27;s the big difference between this and the others?  There is a bigger treatment surface, and the entire surface is smooth.  The other models have a rim at the edge of the light panel, and unfortunately these rims become a collecting-place for any moisturizer (or whatever else may have been on your skin surface) and are either difficult to clean or unhygienic if left uncleaned.  The entire apparatus simply feels more solid and well-constructed.  And the firming attachment has been very effective for me - I&#x27;ve seen a marked reduction in the size of my pores, I have even less breakout than with the lights alone, and my jawline looks firmer.  I tried the less-expensive models first, and thought long and hard before plopping down even more money for this after the first two had broken - I even had reservations about using the firming head, as I was hesitant about its long-term effects - but I am completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The Nova is a high-end system that&#x27;s way more sophisticated than a number of similar products that cost twice as much. Easy to use and I like all the extra bells and whistles it has, like the touch-sensitive feature of its photofacial heads and the automatic shut-down timer. Makes a great gift in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t be one of the unfortunate customers with a short in my unit. I kept thinking maybe it just needed more charging. I know how to turn it on and use it because it worked a few times. But then nothing. This was a heck of a lot of money in October for a heck of a lot of nothing come the first of December. Please just refund my money.</li>
    <li> After only one week I am rather amazed and delighted by the results of using this device, especially since the results are supposed to be cumulative. So far I have mainly used the three-stage micro current feature, but already those horrible vertical lines around my lips have diminished and smoothed, and my complexion in general has tightened and brightened. When I think of all the money I have doled out over the years for creams and serums, this device is a bargain. And it WORKS!! Very glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results and i have been using it as directed. Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy a diffrent product.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap doesn&#x27;t work !!! It burned my face in some places</li>
    <li> Purchased based on reviews, but this is extremely time consuming!  also my face felt very oily in the morning after using the microcurrent settings and since you have to move the wand continually, I was using more product.  I use a fast absorbing moisturizer at night so I had to keep applying.  I think there should be a smaller head so you can reach the wrinkles under the eye area as that is where my problem is.  The battery didn&#x27;t last long, you wont make it thru a complete mocrucurrent treatment and light therapy before you have to recharge. as I was lokking for something that targeted wrinkles and droopy eyelids, this did not deliver and I will go back to my Dermawand.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product 2 weeks ago. It cleans my pores really well and I think I look bit younger, but I don&#x27;t see much improvement on my age spot yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using the \\&quot;Sirius Nova\\&quot;for 1 week and I&#x27;m amazed!I did the patch test on a dog scratch I had on my inner arm.The following day the scratch had faded 3 shades.The scratch was at a level 10 before the treatment.I&#x27;m a 46 yr old African American woman with a brown completion.I have sun damage on my cheeks,forehead,and chin.When I was in my 20&#x27;s I loved sun tanning lotions even though I didn&#x27;t need them.The day after doing the 1st treatment on my face I saw less pigmentation in the damaged areas.I had more of an even tone.My regime is to first washed my face using the \\&quot;Galvanic Head\\&quot; with a water based cleanser (Noxzema).I constantly add water to facilitate the movement of the head on my face.I rinse and then used the green head for the problem areas.Afterward I use the \\&quot;Galvanic Head\\&quot; with a moisturizer adding additional water when needed.Subsuquently my previously oily skin is made perfect.Also a small pimple vanished by the following day by just using the green light.My makeup looks and goes on better.My face is more radient.The results are nothing but miraculous!This really works and it deserves more stars.The device is well made and light weight.Read the instruction booklet carefully and you can&#x27;t go wrong.I have MS and Endometriosis and I haven&#x27;t had any complications.This is well worth it and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This unit is very well made. It holds charge for a long time. I have always had oily acne prone skin. This seems to help cystic acne more so than blackheads or other types of surface acne.</li>
    <li> save your money！it stop working when i used it only for one month!i have sent several e-mail to the seller,but there isn&#x27;t any respond!if you want to use the PHOTOFACIAL TREATMENTS,please consider thria brand。</li>
    <li> I bought this in January 2015 through Amazon and used it as instructed (all components) and for the lights (I was eager for the red to work specifically). I noticed no improvement at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bad enough to have a product that is lousy when you spend $150 but even worse when the customer service over at Sirius Beauty is horrible. I had a blue light go out on the blue clip and attempted to contact them via their website, but all emails I sent to them were rejected and sent back as if the emails were not valid. They had no address or phone number to use either. I also emailed them through their site and I never heard back from them. I then tried to get info from them via their Facebook site only to learn that I&#x27;m NOT the only one having trouble with this company. Finally, I contacted them through Amazon and they DID reply. They promised to send a new blue light which I&#x27;ve yet to receive. I expect it soon. However, who cares when the product is lousy. (I had used Amazon last in my attempts to contact Sirius because I thought I&#x27;d try to just resolve the issue with them directly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was so much promise, I thought, because you received multiple colors and it&#x27;s cordless. But, it doesn&#x27;t work! I mean, the lights glow and the galvanic system you can feel when it&#x27;s on your skin, but my skin did not change or improve. The blue did nothing for acne and the red did nothing for wrinkles or aging. The funny thing is that you only have a limited window for a refund, but you can&#x27;t use the product long enough to see if it works because then you&#x27;re out of the refund window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say this, my mom bought the LightStim via QVC and she has had success with that system. It&#x27;s only red light and it isn&#x27;t cordless, but who cares… it seems to work! I&#x27;m really bummed that the Sirius Beauty system didn&#x27;t work. I was so excited about it when I bought it. Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t improve skin and I warn other potential buyers from buying anything from this company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JUNE 2, 2015: I have yet to receive my blue light replacement. I am contacting Amazon for help in this.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JUNE 11, 2015: Sirius has still not sent me a replacement blue light. They ignored my email through Amazon. I called them and left a message and they did not call back.</li>
    <li> This is not the first light therapy unit I&#x27;ve tried. It is however my favorite. Better than the light therapy is the galvanic and microcurrents. This little gadget does it all.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how well the light therapy actually works (I&#x27;m not that consistent with it), but I love the galvanic cleansing and nourishing head/setting.&lt;br /&gt;This does require a time commitment and does not work overnight.</li>
    <li> I became a believer. I use this product before I go to bed. It really works and I&#x27;ve seen big changes to my 40+ year old acne problems!</li>
    <li> I purchased this few months ago and still using it without any problems so far.It just works fantastic.I use the red head for my deep wrinkles and green for the age spots.The galvanic one works on base of cycle time of 4 minutes for each treating cycle, which is cleanse, nourish, lift n tone)This one can glide your whole face and you can use your own cream or serum with this one.You will have nice skin.I recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I use the blue for acne and it has done wonders for me.  It kills the bacteria that causes acne directly.  Amazing how much clearer my skin looks after a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this as a safe and effective way to deal with acne.  My dermatologist uses something similar but the treatments at the office are far to much for me.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I am always skeptical of such simple solutions. (Snake oil, anyone?)  But whenever I have any kind of inflammation producing procedure at the office, they have always applied the red light therapy. Does this hand held device work? YES YES YES.  It gives a subtle but noticeable lift and brightness to the jaw area where I use it- marionette lines, etc.  I do this while reading emails or watching TV because it does take some time as you move it from place to place on your face.  And you will need eye protection if you go around your eyes (haven&#x27;t tried that yet but plan to.) Because it does take so long I hoped to find a larger light to get my whole face at once.  However when I researched the science and I found that having it as close you your face as possible gives the best result (I rest it against my skin.  gets warm but not unpleasant) I struggled with spending the money but if you take care of your skin in general you will definitely find this a worthwhile addition to your routine.  I have used the green for hyperpigmentation (mine aren&#x27;t bad) and between the two seems to be minimizing dilated capillaries!  I&#x27;ve been using it with no set regularity but I usually get in about 30 minutes 3 time a week for the past 6 months.  I haven&#x27;t used the other heads at all.  UPDATE  Yes it works but just be aware that you may only get 4 months of use out of it.  See other reviews as well to decide if you want to spend the money for it.  Once you stop using it the effects go away.  There is NO way to recoup losses from the company, they have a customer service number that is useless.  UPDATE#2  Decided I would give it one more chance before I threw it away... In fact the CHARGER had stopped working, not the hand piece.  Plugged it into the wall and voila! Back to 5 stars. Moral of the story- trouble shoot a little harder next time</li>
    <li> My device just arrived and I&#x27;m excited to try it. Before I do, I figured those of you with experience using it might be able to advise me on the best way to go about it. I plan to start with the entire regimen, starting with the &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34; mode. Here is what I&#x27;m understanding I&#x27;m supposed to do according to the instructions: apply cleanser, use the cleanse setting, dry face, go through the 3 photo-facial settings, apply serum, use the &amp;#34;nourish&amp;#34; setting, then use the the &amp;#34;lift and tone&amp;#34; setting, then finally apply moisturizer. Does anyone have any suggestions? Tweaks? Before getting this device I would cleanse, dry face, spritz rose water, apply hyaluronic acid serum, then argan oil mixed with moisturizer, and sometimes a retinol cream a few hours later. Since my serum/moisturizing system already has several steps, I&#x27;m not sure what the best order is now that I&#x27;ll also be using the Nova. I don&#x27;t think my serum has any light-relfecting ingredients, so is there any chance it&#x27;s ok to use the photo-facial setting AFTER applying serum, instead of a dry face? I&#x27;m a little concerned about cleansing and then waiting 20 minutes to apply any hydration. Thanks for any advice you might be able to provide! Will add/subtract stars once I figure out what this is all about, and whether it works...</li>
    <li> Like it but some of the led lights did not work.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this device. Got it to lessen wrinkles and loving the results so far. The key is to use it regularly. You can use the different colors to address different issues. My skin feels tighter, younger, and one of my friends is getting one too now after letting her try it. Highly recommended - 5 Stars!!</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting to use the galvanic head, I thought the LED photo facial heads would just be a bonus. But it turned out that I was able to use the galvanic feature only twice before realizing that people who have just had surgery are not supposed to use it. And, people who have metal pins and hardware in their body are not supposed to use it either. The photofacial heads are working really nicely, actually a little better than I expected. I&#x27;m knocking off a star because while I did use the galvonic feature I noticed that it was actually hard to keep your face moist enough for the entire three minutes and the galvonic head got so sticky once that the head pulled off the machine. Which is not too bad if you&#x27;ve found the correct conductive gel to use with this, I unfortunately have not. I am also taking off a star because there was a shipping problem and my order got lost. While the company was very responsive in fixing the problem. They said that they would send me some products to make up for it and never did. I wish that they would upgrade their battery so that you didn&#x27;t have to worry about leaving the device on the charger or using all of the battery before charging again, but overall this is a pretty decent bargain.</li>
