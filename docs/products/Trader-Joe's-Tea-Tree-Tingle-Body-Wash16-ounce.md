      <li>I love the way that Teatree oil makes my skin feel</li>
      <li>They&#x27;d probably get it to foam up better if they added some unnatural and harmful chemical that was lab tested on kittens, but Trader Joe&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do that kinda thing, so you&#x27;re stuck with a non-foamy body wash.    </li>

      <li>It makes my skin feel amazing and the smell wakes me up first thing in the morning!</li>
      <li>The all natural ingredients are great, no one should be rubbing toxic chemicals all over the largest organ in their body.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it made my skin so smooth.</li>
      <li>Rip off!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product but you can buy it for $4  easily....</li>

      <li>Feels great, especially in a post workout shower.</li>
      <li>Once again trader joe&#x27;s products fit the bill.</li>
      <li>The body wash is great, but when I received my four bottles,  two of the bottles were open and spilling into the bag .</li>
      <li>I enjoy the aroma and the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot;.   </li>
      <li>Gives a very fresh feeling.</li>
      <li>If you have an issue that keeps you on the toilet, washing your bottom with this product provides great relief.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this body wash, it really leaves skin tingly, and opens up the sinuses!</li>

      <li>I have very sensitive skin that itches with most body wash.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what it does!</li>
      <li>My husband, who is not particular about his shampoo, absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>Simple amazing ..</li>
      <li>The smell is good as would be expected given it&#x27;s tea tree oil, peppermint and eucalyptus.  </li>
      <li>I ove that fresh, wake-up-and-conquer-the-day feeling.</li>
      <li>but it was worth it.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again at the right price.</li>
      <li>Dove sensitive helped more ;), but my skin still gets irritated a bit.</li>
      <li>[...]  So if you wanna try it, pick it up the next time you&#x27;re buying some fancy pants organic free range grain fed eco friendly recycled products at TJ&#x27;s.    </li>
      <li>The product itself is pretty average-to-disappointing.  </li>
      <li>I went in to Trader Joe&#x27;s and sure enough there</li>

      <li>I ordered the shampoo the first time.</li>
      <li>I would GLADLY pay the extra money to order it from Amazon if I did not have a store</li>
      <li>Great body wash, cleans well and does not over dry skin like other soaps or body washes, avoid sensitive areas as they will begin to feel very cool when using this wash.</li>
      <li>&quot; and makes my skin feel refreshed, cool and not dried out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very good for morning showers when you&#x27;re in a fog.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. It is very refreshing and leaves your skin feeling tingly and cool from the peppermint. It foams up just fine when you use it with a loofah, it may foam less than other washes because it is sodium lauryl sulfate free. SLS is a foaming agent used in many products including body washes, shampoo, toothpaste and mouthwash. Some people such as myself are sensitive to it. I used to have terrible mouth ulcers almost constantly, but when I stopped using SLS toothpaste and mouthwash they went away almost completely! My skin has been less itchy since switching to this body wash, and I also now use the shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I enjoy the aroma and the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot;.   It&#x27;s very refreshing and invigorating during the my morning shower when I need an energy boost.</li>
    <li> Love the minty smell.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that itches with most body wash.  Tea Tree Tingle smells great, calms my skin and relaxes me after a long day! Natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> [...]  So if you wanna try it, pick it up the next time you&#x27;re buying some fancy pants organic free range grain fed eco friendly recycled products at TJ&#x27;s.    The product itself is pretty average-to-disappointing.  The smell is good as would be expected given it&#x27;s tea tree oil, peppermint and eucalyptus.  But it takes a ton of it to get it to foam up.  They&#x27;d probably get it to foam up better if they added some unnatural and harmful chemical that was lab tested on kittens, but Trader Joe&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do that kinda thing, so you&#x27;re stuck with a non-foamy body wash.    [...]</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo and conditioner so decided to try this out. Not for me. Somewhat drying and definitely be careful you don&#x27;t use it on your more sensitive areas if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what has always been missing in my shower rack ... Simple amazing .. I love this product it&#x27;s simple the best</li>
    <li> This product is great! I ove that fresh, wake-up-and-conquer-the-day feeling. Had an episode of pity raisins rosea which itches like the dickens!! Showering with this made my skin feel better. Didn&#x27;t stop the itch but I think it definitely would have been worse. Also, the antibacterial properties of tea tree oil kept my skin from getting irritated due to scratching.</li>
    <li> I love this Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree tingle body wash. Most of all, I love the tingling sensation. Its so relaxing and calms my body. Ir also helped clear up these fungi rash I had on my back, shoulders, arms and chest,  so I definitely recommend this product!  I will buy another bottle when I run out of the one that I have.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash-- so glad I don&#x27;t have to drive to another state to find it! We have no Trader Joe&#x27;s in Montana... The scent is quite strong, some members of the family may find it a little masculine, even just a bit medicinal. To me, it&#x27;s just herbal and very refreshing.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell and definitely does not make you tingle. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This body wash is amazing! It smells great and has tea tree oil, so you have that tingle that tells you you&#x27;re clean. I doesn&#x27;t have any Sodium Laureth Sulfates, and most of the ingredients are organic. You can treat yourself very well with this and not worry about chemicals. The only reason I removed a star is that it is a bit more expensive here than at TJ&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s worth the extra pric if the store is far away. This is the only body wash I use now!</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Wakes me right up in the morning!</li>
    <li> Used this product while visiting my brother.  I loved it and wanted to have some at home.  It is not easy to find.</li>
    <li> Unlike the previous reviewer, I found it foamed plenty...  I love how it \\&quot;tingles\\&quot; and makes my skin feel refreshed, cool and not dried out.  Feels great, especially in a post workout shower. &lt;3 it!</li>
    <li> Works great I love it... I will definitely purchase again. I am pleased with the scent and feel of the bodywash... I will be buying again</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  But you can get it at Trader Joe&#x27;s for $3.99 a bottle....</li>
    <li> I ordered the shampoo the first time. My husband, who is not particular about his shampoo, absolutely loved it. It has a nice tingle, refreshing, and &amp;#34;wake up&amp;#34; type feeling. Loved it so much we ordered the body wash as well, and felt equally pleased with both.</li>
    <li> really don&#x27;t have an experience because haven&#x27;t used it yet have heard it&#x27;s wonderful and really like peppermint shampoo and other products with peppermint so i think i will like it - HOWEVER -YOU CAN GET IT FOR ONLY 3.99 AT THE TRADER JOE&#x27;S STORE OR ON THEIR WEBSITE</li>
    <li> delightful fresh smell. Good lather goes a long way, Well packaged, cap easy to open, easy to control dispensing and closes securely. Clear bottle means you can see remaining product level</li>
    <li> Rip off!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product but you can buy it for $4  easily....&lt;br /&gt;Terrible price</li>
    <li> Best body wash ever. I avoid bar soap because it leaves my skin dehydrated and sticky. This gentle body wash does an excellent job of cleaning my skin without robbing it of moisture. The all natural ingredients are great, no one should be rubbing toxic chemicals all over the largest organ in their body. The smell is sharp and refreshing. Tea Tree Oil scent combined with the peppermint oil is awesome! This is the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> fast delivery - great product</li>
    <li> I think I may be addicted to this body wash. It makes my skin feel amazing and the smell wakes me up first thing in the morning!</li>
    <li> The body wash is great, but when I received my four bottles,  two of the bottles were open and spilling into the bag . Cannot get anyone to respond  to my complaint! One bottle was half full and the other one had about 1/4 of the bottle left.  The product is great but the packaging needs to be improved</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it made my skin so smooth. I got this because I had the hive about a month ago and my skin did not recover from it. It brought my soft skin back. My skin looked as if was polished. I got so many compliments on it. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> First I owe a thank you to the reviewers that said the body wash costs much less in store. I was about to click &#x27;add to cart&#x27; and changed my mind. I went in to Trader Joe&#x27;s and sure enough there it was and only $4. I would GLADLY pay the extra money to order it from Amazon if I did not have a store so close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Smells Great&lt;br /&gt;+ Natural Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;+ Not Packed with Chemicals to Make Suds, so a Loofah or wash cloth is recommended. Pretty good/very good foaming without the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;+ Leaves a clean, fresh, and cooling sensation on the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This is where the negatives go, but there is none! This body wash is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this product to a friend. I would also not worry about paying a few extra dollars and getting it from Amazon either! If you do not have a Trader Joe&#x27;s near than just order it here and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It could be a bit more tingly but hey it does the job.</li>
    <li> I love the way that Teatree oil makes my skin feel so I thought I would try this. Although a little pricier than I would like, it is amazing and works really well! The smell is very refreshing. And you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Loooooove this stuff! It has the word tingle in it and that&#x27;s exactly what it does! It gives you a nice tingle and it smells amazing! I tried this on a whim and I will forever be buying this product!</li>
    <li> The tea tree oil in this body wash adds that extra tingly oomph. Gives a very fresh feeling. I definitely do not want to ever be without it!</li>
    <li> Once again trader joe&#x27;s products fit the bill. Always good on my skin and makes me fill refreshed and clean. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> not gunna lie i love the tingling of this product but since its oil based you breakout like crazy. maybe its just me cause im a pretty active guy but i would rather use ivory. just sayin</li>
    <li> It does have some refreshing peppermint effervescence. It does not, however, match the intensity of &amp;#34;Maul Pitchell&amp;#34; Tea Tree products</li>
    <li> Still irritates skin and mint no go for shower. Dove sensitive helped more ;), but my skin still gets irritated a bit.</li>
    <li> First off....buy it at Trader Joes, it&#x27;s much cheaper. If you have an issue that keeps you on the toilet, washing your bottom with this product provides great relief. It cools.</li>
    <li> so it took 12 days to get to me but it was worth it. They are all so real looking. I had people right next to me say wow i like your tattoo not realizing it was a fake. Perfect and amazing. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I love using this body-wash after a good workout at the gym.  Makes me feel so fresh and so clean clean ;) I also keep it in the guest shower as it can be used for both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the shampoo, it is overpriced on Amazon and can be purchased for $3.99 at the actual store.  If you&#x27;re not a fan of body wash, they carry a 2-pack of tea-tree bars for $2.99 that also works well.  I personally favor the sulfate-free body wash and found the bars left my skin feeling a lot more dry/stripped.</li>
    <li> Good product and smells great</li>
    <li> I like it is good for me an the environment and it&#x27;s all natural with no artificial fragrances added so that&#x27;s why i like it.</li>
    <li> this is a really great body wash i just wish it didn&#x27;t tingle quite as much as it does. smells great tho and seems to do a pretty good job on my skin. i like the all natural aspect too but that tingling sensation just bothers me.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this body wash, it really leaves skin tingly, and opens up the sinuses! I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more tee tree. I ended up adding tea tree oil to it to increase the potency. I&#x27;m going to look for a different product.</li>
    <li> Tingly and refreshing</li>
    <li> I bought this item at Trader Joe&#x27;s and for the $3.99 retail price it works.  However, for this price it is not worth it.  It cleans as it should and that is it.  The &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; is almost a &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sometimes.  I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love anything with tea tree, and also peppermint &amp; eucalyptus.  I had really high hopes for this, but overall I think it&#x27;s just okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great body wash, I just think I&#x27;m more of a soap-person than a body-wash person.</li>
    <li> arrived when indicated and product is as described.</li>
    <li> Not really tingly. Will never buy again. Bleh.</li>
    <li> Great body wash, cleans well and does not over dry skin like other soaps or body washes, avoid sensitive areas as they will begin to feel very cool when using this wash.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son, who does not like bar soap.  Good price, good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again at the right price.</li>
    <li> Be careful this product is way overpriced by some 50% mark up.</li>
    <li> This product is great! (But buy it in a TJ&#x27;s store if you can, it&#x27;s only about $4). I&#x27;ve had bad body acne for a while and was using Neutrogena and Dial acne products, but then I realized they were causing a huge rash that spread all over my legs. I bought this on a whim since tea tree oil is supposed to be an antibacterial and it has worked so much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. That mint smell can be kind of overwhelming in the shower,  but it&#x27;s a nice wake-up. Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much more detail I can give for body wash. :) However, I do think that it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love all tea tree oil products because it is a natural oil that can be used for many medicinal purposes.  I happen to buy this one because the ingredients and the price were in sync.  I had it shipped to my daughters house along with some other products because my little grandson caught a fungal infection at his pre-k and was losing his finger and toe nails.  My daughter used this and also the fairy tale hair products to repel lice.  I am happy to report that all of Aydens nails have returned in better than ever shape.  Sometimes it takes an invisible costume to protect us.</li>
