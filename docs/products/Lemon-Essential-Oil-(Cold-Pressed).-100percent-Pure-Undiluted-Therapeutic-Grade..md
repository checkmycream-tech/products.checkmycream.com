<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use essential oil for cleaning purposes and it rocks. I use stainless steel pans for cooking and if you&#x27;ve never used stainless steel before, they are not non-stick I spent quite a bit if money on my Rachael Rays and tried everything to get the stains off of them. (sos pads, soaking over night etc) Then I discovered lemon essential oil and baking soda! With this stuff I can literally just wipe the grime out of the bottom of my pans. It is also a big bonus to me that the cleaning power this packs is all natural no icky chemicals to leave residues and what not. I have also been told that lemon essential oil is great for cleaning baked on grime in your oven, I haven&#x27;t tried that yet but will update when I do. I love this product and will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Yummy smell. Delivers therapeutically and antiseptically. It&#x27;s one of the really good ones!</li>
    <li> Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available. This did not come out smelling good or anything like what I&#x27;m used to. I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
    <li> I make my own fabric softener and this makes the laundry smell so fresh! Plan on using it in my homemade facial cleanser and soap. Very pleased...will order again.</li>
    <li> It smells like you just squeezed a fresh lemon. I used it as a car scent.&lt;br /&gt;I also put a few drops on a candle and it will emit a wonderful smell.It is a quality product.</li>
    <li> I got this to keep spiders off my windows but I&#x27;m not sure it works that well. I don&#x27;t want to give it a bad review because it can be used for so many things and it smells soooo good. I&#x27;m sure ill figure out another use tor it. I did try a drop in a tea light and it gave the room a nice natural and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I continue to be amazed with the quality of Plant Therapy&#x27;s products. Lemon Essential Oil is accomplishing exactly what I hoped it would and exceeding my expectations as their oils always do.</li>
    <li> Love Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL AND THE SCENT IS LIKE AMAZING FRESH LEMONS! It arrived early too! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love these essential oils! Excellent quality!</li>
    <li> Fast ship and great oil!!!</li>
    <li> fast shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> This one is the best so far. Very good quality and its consistency is perfect. It&#x27;ll work great on any recipe that you want to add a lemony flavor.</li>
    <li> It tasted like furniture polish when I added a few drops to my 32 oz water bottle.  Will use for cleaning and not as a water additive</li>
    <li> Pleasant smelling oil. Nice addition to bug spray, deoderent, and chest spray</li>
    <li> I am not an expert on oils so I will not try to grade it&#x27;s authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful scent. Works great to keep mosquitoes away.</li>
    <li> Love the essential oils!</li>
    <li> I love this oil for cleaning, fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> The product was as described</li>
    <li> After purchasing some of the more expensive oils, I decided to give Plant Therapy a try, and I am amazed. These products are as good or better than their competitors and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Plant Therapy is customer oriented and their service is to be envied by the competition. I have already ordered more oils and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I am experimenting with homemade cleaning products- I hate the chemical smell of commercially produced cleaners. A few drops of this gives a great lemon smell. Used as I do (an additive, a few drops/batch), this bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this company. If you are tired of brand wars in essential oil use check them out! I use lemon mostly for cleaning...but also in a great allergy blend. My husband says it helps, and he isn&#x27;t much for using natural remedies!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good essential oil.. Used it for a few homemade products around the house (deodorant &amp; cleaners).  Has the great lemon smell you&#x27;d expect. I don&#x27;t mind the euro-dropper people talk about, just take the lid off &amp; turn over &amp; it drips out.</li>
    <li> Always a pleasures! Great quality and super quick delivery!</li>
    <li> fast service last along time good quality very good price for size of container  have ordered in the past will again thanks</li>
    <li> A generous amount compared to other brands of therapeutic grade plant oils. A good clean lemon smell.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in an aromatherapy diffuser, and it smells wonderful for about 15 minutes, but is undetectable after that&lt;br /&gt;no matter if I increase the amount of drops. It&#x27;s also great mixed with other oils to add a lemony element.&lt;br /&gt;  This would be great in homemade furniture polish.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Excellent aroma and reasonable price. I will buy it again and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and price!</li>
    <li> Use as final rinse scent in clothes washer. I place a few drops diluted in water in the &#x27;softener&#x27; section of my washer and the clothes smell much nicer.  (I use only free &amp; clear type soaps/cleansers.)</li>
    <li> Very Happy with all Plant Therapy Products!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Decent little oil, fresh lemon scent is nice. I have liked it but probably wont buy it again since I have other oils I like better that aren&#x27;t quite so expensive.</li>
    <li> Great quality, comparable to more expensive MLM brands. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I use this when making my own cleaning products.  Lemon works for so many things around the home and is natural</li>
    <li> Good quality oil with a very pure lemon smell.  And a good sized bottle for the price.  Pleased with this purchase and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy Plant Therapy products in the future.</li>
    <li> Used it to make hand scrub--smells wonderful and did the job with no problems.  Right size for the small amount needed.</li>
    <li> The  lemon essential oil is as seen and expected. It does what it  is supposed to do. It is good for mixing. I am satisfied, in hinsite I should have spent a little more $ and bought it organic. However, it has versatile uses and it works!</li>
    <li> I love this lemon essential oil.  I use it in my homemade cleaners or in my diffuser.  I also appreciate the &amp;#34;kid safe&amp;#34; notation on the front of the bottle.  I have purchased essential oils from Plant Therapy in the past and will continue to do so in the future!</li>
    <li> Yes, that is what I use it for.  My home made laundry soap.  It makes my laundry smell so fresh when I make the soap out of washing soda and my family loves it.</li>
    <li> I love to use this oil mixed with peppermint in my diffuser. The scent is amazing. Anyhow, this company did an amazing job creating this oil and it was sold to me at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh scent of lemon and this has that smell. The only problem I have is that the smell wears off rather fast and I wanted it to last longer then it does. I would still recomend this for crafters more then as a body scent</li>
    <li> I have received this product but to be honest I have not had a chance to use it.  It smells wonderful and I plan to dilute it and use it in a spray bottle to fresh up the guest bedroom mattress and linens.</li>
    <li> Love the scent from this.  It is good and strong and I am a little surprised because it was so reasonable in price.  GREAT product for soap or candle making.  I actually add it to home made fly spray for my horses and they smell awesome!!  GREAT product!</li>
    <li> who doesn&#x27;t like lemon. Very satisfied with the product. smells great, I&#x27;ve added it to many cleaning products and diffused it and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really love the lemon Essential Oil.  It has such a wonderful effect as a room refresher.  I would buy this again once I am out of this bottle.  Also use it as a mouth wash.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and good quality product, great value for 30mL too! I use for carpet powder and to mix my own sugar scrubs, or to freshen up my sink when i dont have a lemon on hand to squeeze. My bathroom smells great after showering with eo scrubs and i keep a few scents around for that purpose. scent doesn&#x27;t last terribly long on the carpets but they are high traffic and it gets the job done! Very happy, keep coming back for more.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, great product.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughters have been using this on their faces after showers as an astringent.  Works great!  Their acne is clearing up nicely!</li>
    <li> A couple of drops in a sprayer, humidifier etc adds a nice fragrance without perfumes .  This product  is just pure lemon.  Nice</li>
    <li> Add to my whole made laundry detergent and great to use on stains - just apply directly to stain.  Has even helped on set stains.</li>
    <li> Smells great I can&#x27;t wait to use it. I am now using more and more natural products in my life</li>
    <li> Not as good as the YL lemon but still has a great aroma and is a lot cheaper</li>
    <li> I love love this lemon. I use it in SO many ways -- it smells amazing. I use it in my face wash, in my diet, in my son&#x27;s acme cream and many more things!</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, very fast delivery and good packaging.  Nice fragrance.  Have not yet used this in product yet so am unable to actually say how it performed for me.  But, If is is as other EO&#x27;s I have ordered by this company,  I expect great results.</li>
    <li> I use this for making my own cleaning solutions.  It works really well, leaves a pleasant scent, not chemically at all.</li>
    <li> I love this Lemon essential oil. It smells Great! It has many uses, I primarily use this to clean my laminate floors and vinyl window blinds. I mix about a quart of warm water with about 2 cups distilled vinegar and 20 drops of lemon essential oil. The essential oil smells wonderful and cuts the nasty vinegar smell while you are cleaning and it also works as a degreaser.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected,smell great,but the scent do not last long.</li>
    <li> Smell great! I use it in bath tub, kitchen to make the room smell good.  I also use it to do my hair treatment.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is wonderful and it last a long time.  My husband and I use it in our Cpap water holder.  Nice fragrance to go to sleep on and wake up to.</li>
    <li> Not as lemony as I wanted.  I also purchased the peppermint from the same company and it is a much better product.</li>
    <li> Smell great. Good price. I love plant therapy oils.They are therapeutic grade and do a good job without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I make my own laundry detergent and add about 20 - 40 drops when making a 5 gallon pail of detergent.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works like a charm to repel buggies and spiders</li>
    <li> Great for a room freshener.  A little expensive.  Great scent!</li>
    <li> very good product and smelled very good. would do business with again. will try different oils again. good product will try again.</li>
    <li> I am a Plant Therapy convert. I know that some people swear by other brands of oils, but I have never had a bad experience with any product purchased from Plant Therapy, and I have seen great results with their oils for my family&#x27;s health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Lemon essential oil. We are trying to eliminate most of the chemicals in our home, and I bought this with the intention of using it to add to my vinegar cleaning mixture to cut the vinegar smell and help the mixture&#x27;s effectiveness. I have also discovered that I love using this for more than just cleaning. I love adding it to my oil blends, and the scent is strong but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil and seller!</li>
    <li> Use on cotton balls and a natural room deodorizer light and fresh. Perfect. Gives a Spring fresh smell in the winter</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the smell throughout my house</li>
    <li> I have recently been making my own skincare and toiletry items for myself, family and friends.  The quality of these essential oils are absolutely top of the line.  I am a repeat customer and will remain a customer as long as the competitive pricing and good quality remain consistent.  Thank you, Plant Therapy for great service.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my aroma diffuser...it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Nice addition to a home-made vinegar based cleaning solution. My wife was against cleaning with vinegar before I added this.  A few drops really nullifies the vinegar smell and makes the solution smell &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.  I also drop a little in the diaper pail once in a while for odor neutralizing.</li>
    <li> I got this to take labels off wine bottles but have since found a million other uses.  My plumber even used to get silicone off my tile.  It is crazy to me how well this stuff works and how many harsh chemicals I will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it in everything. It is used to clean, drink, deodorize, and even in my dogs water!</li>
    <li> I ordered this either for my wife and I or as a gift if you look at the rating we gave it that will tell you if we liked it or not, if it is special we will add a little comment same if it is bad. But telling me how many word I need to use is STUPID !!</li>
    <li> I use essential oils for homeopathic [external] remedies, as well as for scented body oils. I prefer the citrus family for my oils. A base of grapeseed oil and this lemon essential oil is a lovely after shower moisturizer, and I can pronounce all the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I use vinegar mixed with dish detergent as a kitchen and bathroom cleaner.  Adding this lemon oil works great to mask the strong vinegar smell of the cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> I have been using lemon essential oil to combat toxins, bacteria and yeast. It work&#x27;s great! The bottle dispenses the oil without a big mess.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of lemon and found a great recipe on line for making your own home cleaners.  This adds that perfect fresh scent of lemon and makes the job of cleaning a bit more pleasant.  I bought a few bottles of this and have gifted them to other family members so they can also make their own home cleaners.  Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love all of the oils that I have tried but lemon is my favorite :)</li>
    <li> I mix this into some body lotion, drop it in my water, make kitchen cleaning solution, and keep it around just so I can occasionally sniff the great aroma. Great stuff, definitely will be buying more oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> I just use it for cleaning but its ok for that</li>
    <li> Lemon oil is one of the oils I use the most, and I&#x27;m a big fan of Plant Therapy. We use Lemon almost daily for things like cleaning, removing stickers or residue from things (works better and faster than Goo Gone), degreasing dishes and getting stuck on food off safely, and I even use it along with Peppermint in a gelatin capsule for weight loss. You get a lot in this 30 ml bottle at a great discount, but my family still manages to fly through our lemon quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is true and strong, but still pleasantly citrusy and fresh. It blend well with other citrus oils, as well as many others. I like to combine with Peppermint and diffuse (or added to some water in a fine misting bottle) to use as an air freshener. The uplifting scent helps perk me up and keep me going when I start to get sluggish in the afternoons, or to help me wake up in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Great price and company!</li>
    <li> We ordered this to help calm our 2 yo son to sleep at night...worked like a charm!!! It was lights out for a peaceful nights sleep after 20 approx 20 minutes. Wonderful stuff!! Has helped with the Bedtime Blues!</li>
    <li> I am using this oil for my new, green approach to cleaning my house. The ingredients used include choosing essential oils for both their beneficial properties and their scent. Lemon serves as an antibiotic, anti fungal, antiviral, and antibacterial, and of course smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Ohhh how I love this for making my kitchen spray! About 1/2 cup of vinegar and 20 ish drops of this in 16ish ounces of water and it&#x27;s an awesome, grease cutting spray for SOOOO cheap!! This bottle makes me probably 5 or so bottles of spray? Not sure on that. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. I put a few drops on areas frequented by ants, did the trick. I also used it(diluted) as a dusting spray for wooden furniture.  It cleaned the furniture well and naturally, the nice fragrance is a bonus.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND FAST SHIPPING. THANKS!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil to put in your water. It gives it a nice taste and can tell that it is a therepeutic blend.</li>
    <li> Love the lemon smell. CLEAN.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh smell of this when used in cleaning ! So uplifting.  Delivered fast. Plant therapy is a affordable company to buy essential oils from.  Will buy more from this company!</li>
    <li> Smells so fresh and wonderful....great in the diffuser, in homemade deodorant (unless you have very sensitive skin, then use only a drop or two)</li>
    <li> Got this to use in my homemade electric shaver cleaner.  Works.  Since getting this oil, I&#x27;ve thought of a number of other uses.  I add it to my spray bottle of home mixed multi-purpose cleaner; and I plan to use it for other similar items.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this product! I use it by itself on my wrists and neck, or add it to my favorite lemon verbena lotion to \\&quot;punch\\&quot; it up.</li>
    <li> It arrived as expected. I mix it with honey and use it in hot water.  Lovely.  I like that the cap is labeled.</li>
    <li> I really like this lemon oil.  Arrived on time and packaging was very secure.  So far I have used this in a soap, and alone mixed with shea butter and just recently used it along with orange essential oil for a body butter as a gift.  The scent came out really nice.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this brand of essential oil before, but decided to try it. It is a quality oil at a reasonable price. Would buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the scent and quality of this essential oil. What made me even happier was that the bottle actually delivered drops in an even and &amp;#34;countable&amp;#34; manner instead of just glugging away. Very important to me when combining different oils for a desired result.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome!  However I bought it to use as a scent for laundry.  I put a few drops on a sock and threw it into the dryer, but the clothes didn&#x27;t really smell like lemon at all &#x3D; bummer.  I had to put 10 - 20 drops on a sock before it left any lingering lemon scent, which was disappointing.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Great product and great value. Will definitely buy again when I need to add to my essential oil stash!</li>
    <li> Great quality lemon essential oil at a reasonable priced.  I use this for colds, flu, etc.  Just mix with a carrier oil and rub on the bottom of feet or on chest.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this lemon oil. The fragrance is wonderful. I use it in water and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product. I use this with a blend I created on a nightly basis and sleep much better.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, packaged well and the quality of the product is exquisite! I highly recommend this product and plan to purchase more!</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning, polishing wood, in drinking water, and for age spots!</li>
    <li> Does not drip out...had to take white thing out...very frustrating.  It is too bad because I do like the product, but, I don&#x27;t like the hassel.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this oil and as always the excellent quality!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it as part of my allergy remedy.  Works great!</li>
    <li> It smells great in the bottle but doesn&#x27;t put out a scent in my warmer.  I also use it to mix with some homemade cleaning solutions and it seems to help there.</li>
    <li> The lemon essential oil is just what I hoped for. Thank you for a good product at a good price and for good service.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of the lemon oil I purchased. It is a great addition to my theraputic oils. I will shop with this store again.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy therapeutic-grade lemon oil was received promptly and in good condition.  It smells wonderful.  I am using a drop in my aloe body lotion and hope it helps with a skin problem I am trying it on.</li>
    <li> Bought this oil (and the Lavender) to make my own anti-bacterial cleaning spray (water and vinegar and oils..it&#x27;s fantastic).&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the oil quality.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the larger bottle &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34; easier - the smaller bottles seem to take longer or need a few shakes to get the drops going.</li>
    <li> I have been putting a few drops of this in my water. A very nice change to regular water and it taste great. Supposed to have vey good detoxing properties also.</li>
    <li> Very good quality essential oil. I use it to make my vinegar tea. There are many lemon essential oils that taste like Pledge furniture polish (YUCK). But not this one. It tastes and smells of pure lemon. Good product that I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love ordering from Plant Therapy.  Their orders are always packaged carefully and delivered promptly.  The lemon essential oil has to be my favorite essential oil to smell.  I can&#x27;t wait to start using it!</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy is a great essential oil manufacturer, always pleased with all oils bought from them.</li>

    <li> Nice and lemony, not artificial smelling like others. Like very much. One star ding for tiny, tiny bit of leakage.</li>
    <li> 5 stars speaks for itself.</li>
