      <li>I have fine hair - perfect as daily or deep conditioner</li>
      <li>just cannot say enough good things about this product (or the seller)</li>

      <li>I will be purchasing the full size once my sample runs out.  </li>
      <li>A quarter size amount is sufficient for full coverage.</li>
      <li>so I bought a full size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It did repair my dry ends, and I was really impressed by how soft my hair felt...</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the $26 price tag and the full size</li>

      <li>Very good product, have my hair soft and manageable, would recommend it to anyone that whose hair is dry and frizzy,</li>

      <li>It took me a little more product than I thought it would to make me feel like I had a nice coverage.</li>
      <li>Well worth a try.</li>
      <li>It sits on my hair and isn&#x27;t absorbed, my hair comes out tangled, matted, and greasy.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>It is pricey but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>

      <li>I have to say I notice a difference in strength right away.</li>
      <li>Great deep conditioner, especially for thicker hair.</li>
      <li>It made my VERY processed hair feel soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using once a week and keeping it on for 5 minutes as instructed, so I&#x27;m going to try 10 minutes, twice a week to see if I get better results.</li>
      <li>I was worry at first.</li>
      <li>The first time I ordered the top came cracked, and I let it slide since the product was left intact.</li>
      <li>So I can attest that it really does work!  </li>
      <li>My simple conditioner does a better job.</li>
      <li>a light scent that&#x27;s not harsh or overpowering.</li>
      <li>This conditioner provided a good deep conditioning that I could use multiple times a week.</li>
      <li>The container is a good size and will last a while for while with my short hair.</li>
      <li>I buy the Regis Design Line Silver Care (I&#x27;m blonde with lots of baby fine hair)</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>think the argan and avocado oils are really helping my hair.  </li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any difference after using this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s making my hair much softer and healthier feeling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got a sample of this in my Ipsy bag awhile back and because I have long hair it only lasted for 2 sessions. However I adore this mask. It makes your hair feel like you just got out of the salon. It&#x27;s well worth the $26 price tag and the full size tub is pretty big so as long as I only use a decent amount but not too much then I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be running out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I like the product enough to order it a second time, but I have to address something about the shipping/packaging. The first time I ordered the top came cracked, and I let it slide since the product was left intact. However, I reordered and received my package today only to find the product had leaked from container and on to the box. The leaked product was hardening around the top and inside the box.  Not what I was looking forward to when I received my package...</li>
    <li> It is raining like crazy and no frizz for these 3b curls!  Also, it is helping with growing my hair out. The ends are drying very slowly. Use this once a week. I love this product. Worth the price. I have thick shoulder blade length hair. A little goes a long way. A quarter size amount is sufficient for full coverage.</li>
    <li> I loved this product&#x27;s name and saw excellent reviews, so I decided to try it out. It did repair my dry ends, and I was really impressed by how soft my hair felt... Two days after the treatment. I wash my hair everyday, and after the first day I used this product it weighted my hair down a little. Only after I washed it the next day (without using the mask) did it reach the effect I had hoped for at the beginning. My hair is wavy and somewhat thin, and I have VERY dry ends due to residues of a straightening chemical treatment. I recommend this product, but now I know I should use it a few days before I need my hair to look pretty... Not the day right before a special event.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair - perfect as daily or deep conditioner</li>
    <li> Nothing to scream about as I had read in other reviews.</li>
    <li> I have use it before. And its awesome if u have dry hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive for my taste, but after trying my sample from Ipsy, I had to psych myself up into splurging on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly &#x27;mixed girl&#x27; hair that is bleached/color-treated to the point where my ends have been killed off and they don&#x27;t curl anymore even with other deep conditioning. Was very surprised how after I tried this, my ends curled up again along with the rest of my hair and untreated new growth! A little can go a long way, but I will likely save this for my post-color touch-ups once a month considering how pricey this is and stick to Aussie&#x27;s 3-minute miracle for other conditioning treatments in-between.</li>
    <li> This product is WAY overpriced, and it doesn&#x27;t work. It sits on my hair and isn&#x27;t absorbed, my hair comes out tangled, matted, and greasy. Save yourself a few dollars. I think mayonaise would work better than this stuff. I buy the Regis Design Line Silver Care (I&#x27;m blonde with lots of baby fine hair) and it is way more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and it was great.... so I bought it and I don&#x27;t know what the deal is... but it&#x27;s not affecting my hair like the sample did. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Works better the longer I leave it on my hair.  It&#x27;s making my hair much softer and healthier feeling. Nice scent too!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any difference after using this. My conditioner basically works better. I&#x27;ve only been using once a week and keeping it on for 5 minutes as instructed, so I&#x27;m going to try 10 minutes, twice a week to see if I get better results. Either way, meh product for the price. It smells pretty good/interesting, though!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, color treated hair. This made my hair soft, but not significantly more that other, less expensive products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells really nice, without being an overpowering scent. I use it weekly. It makes my hair feel so soft! Amazon currently has the best price I&#x27;ve found at $24-$25</li>
    <li> Great product. Well worth a try. Have used this product 3 times now and have noticed a huge difference in how my hair sheds. Great product</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing.  I used color oops on my bleached, dyed hair so imagine how straw like hair.&lt;br /&gt;I added some of this conditioner, left on 30 min under shower cap, rinsed...and hair felt like virgin hair afterwards.  Most conditioners are good. This one is great.  Incredible softeness, strength and moisture retention.  It rivals my past fav Redken Extreme Builder Plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just cannot say enough good things about this product (or the seller)</li>
    <li> Great deep conditioner, especially for thicker hair. I have naturally thin, fine hair and it made my hair a little heavy at the roots, but not enough to turn me off of it. It smells fantastic! Maybe an earthy coconuty smell? Its texture is that of most deep conditioners, a thick white cream. It took me a little more product than I thought it would to make me feel like I had a nice coverage. It rinses out easily and you keep that nice smell all day (or all night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used it: Since it made my hair a littttle heavy I used it at night before I went to bed or on days I would wear my hair up. Usual routine of wash, deep condition, other showerly duties and then rinse and go worked well.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews here I thought I was in for some otherworldly experience after using this product.  About my hair:  Curly (Type III B/C), highlighted, prone to bouts of dryness.  I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference or feeling in my hair immediately after rinsing it out upon my first use, and I did let my hair air dry.  Once it was fully dry it did feel pleasantly soft, but no softer than it does when I use some other, less expensive products that I like.  And I must say that this part is my fault, but I didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the size of the product on the website when researching and ordering it.  When it arrived I was a little surprised at how small the container is for the price, I expected it to be bigger.  Would I repurchase?  Nah.  I&#x27;ll continue using the products I have.</li>
    <li> i love it! I use it for weekly deep conditioning, i leave it in my hair about 3 to 4 hours and rinse it out, leaving my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product..been using for a while now..I have to say I notice a difference in strength right away. Gonna stick with this product!</li>
    <li> Not the BEST in the world, but really, really good! I like the smell and it makes my hair softer and appear less damaged.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Similarly cheaper options: the L&#x27;Oreal in the yellow/black tub.</li>
    <li> I have been using Briogeo Don&#x27;t Despair, Repair Deep Conditioner for several months and I love it. I have fine straight blond hair, and I have it colored every 3 months, so it&#x27;s damaged. This conditioner not only repairs the damage but also gives my hair some volume. It&#x27;s worked better than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used. And it does not weigh my hair down, as other products do. Very happy I found this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I received a sample in my Ipsy bag and fell in love with the way it conditioned my hair so I bought a full size.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, thin hair and it splits and I get flyways and constantly. This conditioning mask works wonders on my hair. I am not sure how often you are supposed to use it but I generally do every other shower. Pleasant small, not messy. I recommend it</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t provide as much moisture as I had wanted.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I use it as an everyday leave in conditioner because it isn&#x27;t heavy. It makes my hair look and feel the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Like a lot.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so silky after using this!!  And people are noticing which is the biggest tell-tale sign it&#x27;s actually making an improvement.  I have keratin treated hair and I swim a lot -- so this mask has been a godsend.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is very thick and rich. My hair felt healthier, hydrated, and smooth after using it the first time. It rinses out clean and did not weigh my hair down at all. I mention this because I have long wavy light brown hair that can sometimes look flat and lack volume at the roots if I use too much product or product that is too heavy -- I did not have that problem with this conditioner. My hair is not color treated, but I do blow dry it and use heat styling tools on it almost daily. This conditioner provided a good deep conditioning that I could use multiple times a week. My only complaint relates to the container; I don&#x27;t particularly like it because it was difficult to open in the shower with wet hands. However, the product itself was very nice. After a few uses I found that my hair was easier to style and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> loooove this product!</li>
    <li> Such a great product!  It does what it says.  My long blond damaged color treated hair looks healthier, smoother, and shinier after one use.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample in my subscription with ipsy and I love it.  After I use this product my hair is the softest it has ever been when using any type of hair care product.  I will be purchasing the full size once my sample runs out.  And I would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as a side note I have shoulder length, wavy frizzy hair in case you have the same hair type as me and wanted to know if it would work for you.  I would also say I only use this once a week maybe twice because the softness stays for few days so you won&#x27;t, or at least I don&#x27;t, have to use too much product at once so it is worth the money if you think about how long it will last you.  For longer hair types it might be a different story.</li>
    <li> I have 10-inches of natural, color-treated hair and this conditioner left my hair soft, hydrated, and manageable. It does not take a lot to completely coat the hair, so I expect 5-6 uses from a jar of this size.</li>
    <li> Wow it works so great i love this! I have gone from platinum to red to brown to brown blonde it helps my split ends and makes my hair so soft</li>
    <li> Very good product, have my hair soft and manageable, would recommend it to anyone that whose hair is dry and frizzy,</li>
    <li> Does everything it promises, stops breakage, strengthens, leaves your hair soft and shiny....This is now the only conditioner I use.</li>
    <li> I bought this from amazon after seeing it on the list of best conditioners by NaturallyCurly.com. When I received it was upset because it was only 5 oz for over 20.00, but I used it after ligthening my 4b/c coily hair and WOW!! well worth the money. I used it right after the neutralizing shampoo. My hair bounced back! Great product! The smell is good not ooh smells so good but a light scent that&#x27;s not harsh or overpowering. I used more than I probably needed but I wanted to be sure my strands were coated after using the bleaching agent. The rest of my head that I didn&#x27;t color also loved this product. My curls soaked it up and had plenty of life. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best mask. I have a teen daughter who is starting high school this fall 2014. She is natural never had any chemicals in her hair.  She wanted some highlights and color on her bang area. I was worry at first. I knew I had to change my hair products and regime for her natural colored hair. I found this colored system from shea moisture. Even though it states to be natural and organic i didn&#x27;t want to take a chance with ner hair. I colored it and it turned out beautiful. After researching online line and youtubers, I came across an email from naturally curly website I subscribe too. They list this conditioner along with others that was best for colored treated hair. After reading thr reviews on amazon and despite the price, I bought it. Best decision. I coat her hair with this product and set her under our hair steamer. Wash it out and the slip was amazing on her hair. I know everyone hair acts differentially, but i finally found something that her hair loves. Combing was a breeze. Her hair was beautiful after the finish results. For the size and price I only got two washes.  Its worth the price and until I can found another mask that her hair love I will be purchasing this every month. Hopefully they lower the price. They will have a loyal customer. I cant wait to try this on my relaxed hair. No matter natural, colored, or relaxed hair it is the best conditioner hair mask.</li>
    <li> I had received a sample size of this product and I LOVED it! It made my VERY processed hair feel soft and healthy. I bought this full sized container and it has done nothing. My simple conditioner does a better job. I don&#x27;t know what the difference is but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am overflowing with samples of this product so I finally decided to start using them.  Turns out, I like it a lot, and I will shortly be running out of samples and will have to spring for a full-sized container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was very easy to work through my hair (waist-length, thick, color-treated, dry, and somewhat frizzy).  I did have to use quite a lot but that is due to my hair length, not any inadequacy of the product.  I left it on as instructed (not sure exactly how long, but at least 5 minutes, I&#x27;d estimate) and rinsed it out.  I didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or anything.  I then used my regular detangler and let my hair air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now the next morning and my hair is particularly soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve been trying to finish off a shampoo that is OK but not great for me, and this has counteracted some of the less desirable effects of that shampoo.  I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is weighed down, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the argan and avocado oils are really helping my hair.  Please note this is not a vegan product as it contains hydrolyzed silk, hydrolyzed keratin, and hydrolyzed collagen, all of which can come only from animal sources.  It smells pretty good and I like that all the plant extracts and oils provide the fragrance (no dyes or perfumes in this!).</li>
    <li> So perfect. The best deep conditioner on the market. It is pricey but worth every penny. The container is a good size and will last a while for while with my short hair. It&#x27;s hard to find high end products that African Americans can use. I tried it on a whim ( it came free in my Ipsy bag) and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I never wash my hair without it. It leaves your hair soft, strong and smelling great. The difference without it is night and day!</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy hair, that I have been growing out. My hair has a tendency towards being dry and damaged, which has made growing it out long hard due to all the breakage. This product was awesome! Noticeable difference after first use! It just got better from there! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> From the amazing ingredients to how this mask actually performs on my 3c curls -- this product is truly fantastic and a staple in my hair care assortment.  This mask really hydrates my hair, softens my curls, and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable decrease in the breakage.  So I can attest that it really does work!  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of mixed race with curly hair. This stuff is amazing. And I&#x27;ve tried lots of products..</li>
    <li> great product just too expensive to buy</li>
