      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why more stores don&#x27;t carry them, or carry someone else&#x27;s  (like Revlon&#x27;s) version of them.  </li>
      <li>My wife and my mother truly love these things.</li>
      <li>These work very well and are a great deal.  </li>

      <li>Was glad I could find it and gave it as a stocking stuffer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to buy them at a decent price on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>these are nice nail files, but the abrasive surface wears off quickly</li>
      <li>Bought them to smooth out my dogs nails :)</li>
      <li>and I just love how smooth you can get your nails.  </li>
      <li>The pointed tip at opposite end is absolutely great for going around the cuticle area and leaving a nice clean finish.</li>
      <li>Recommend to all friends and even given a couple away to friends for no reason other than to give my friends what I think is great!  </li>
      <li>a nice, neat and smooth job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had never heard of this brand but the many positive reviews lead me to try the files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I also use them on my dogs nails to smooth them over between clippings.  </li>
      <li>of them lasts like or has the smooth feel of a Diamond Deb.  </li>
      <li>The point on the tip is useful for many things.  </li>
      <li>I have a heck of a time keeping my fingernails smooth</li>
      <li>This is the good old fashion stand by file that I grew up with.  </li>
      <li>If you the plastic handled file, make sure you order the right one.</li>
      <li>like many f the others i love the old diamond deb files</li>
      <li>but they are only good for one, maybe two, uses and then the grit is worn away.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m beginning to think they are all true.</li>
      <li>For those times you need to fix a quick break in a nail or a jagged edge.</li>
      <li>I find them adequate but</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>I live in the woods and even though it is beautiful here I miss the cosmopolitan shopping experience.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these files!  When I use them for fingernails, I file down one side so I can use it as a finishing file and leave one side coarser.  Although these are amazingly good for filing finger nails, I bought them for filing wire on jewelry items.  They work great and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellant file, works well.</li>
    <li> Works well, good price.</li>
    <li> Finally, files that really work. I have tried so many and have depleted oodles of emery boards that don&#x27;t last and take forever to file. These are great. I now have one handy around the house and in my car.</li>
    <li> For nail care, Diamond Deb files are the best.  My father gave me my first 6 inch file when I was 10.  That was over 40 years ago and I still have and use it every day.  It is getting a little worn out so I bought these new ones.  I gave one to each daughter and now have some left over.  I won&#x27;t need to buy another file as long as I live.  Diamond Debs are that good.</li>
    <li> Love these.  Wish I could find them at local stores.</li>
    <li> Bought these for myself.  I have a heck of a time keeping my fingernails smooth (probably because I bite them).  I find that emory boards while cheap don&#x27;t last very long.  I bought these and have them in strategic locals around my house (and one in my truck) so now I never have rough nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved the \\&quot;Diamon Deb\\&quot; nail files for, it seems, almost 50 years.  There&#x27;s nothing better.  They last.  The tip is thin and will fit under the tip of your nail to clean in places where water sometimes won&#x27;t flow (or if you&#x27;re on the road with no access to water).  They&#x27;re better than emery boards for filing.  The point on the tip is useful for many things.  And the thinness of the overall file is immeasurably useful.  They come in a little plastic case.   You can slip them in your purse -- they take up no room at all.  I don&#x27;t understand why more stores don&#x27;t carry them, or carry someone else&#x27;s  (like Revlon&#x27;s) version of them.  But none are as good as the Diamon Deb.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;re getting more and more difficult to find.  The price is right.  They do the job: There&#x27;s a rougher side and a finer side, for all purposes.  They&#x27;re great for pedicures, too.  I&#x27;m grateful to have found these.  You cannot have enough.</li>
    <li> They were pretty much what I expected. Sorry they weren&#x27;t made in USA (like the ORIGINAL ones)</li>
    <li> DiamonDebs are the only nail file I will use. This is a SUPER deal, and at this low price, I could afford to have one in every room and still give a couple away as presents.</li>
    <li> Work as expected from years of experience.</li>
    <li> Grabbed a bundle of these babies so I would always have one at hand.  One of the few files that don&#x27;t rip my fragile nails to shreds.  So happy to find these, they are like hen&#x27;s teeth when looking for them in local retail stores.</li>
    <li> I got my Damond Deb about 1970.  I lost it about a year ago when my cat took it somewhere, and have been mourning it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;I had looked in stores for one several times to give as gifts and never found any, so when I lost it, I thought they weren&#x27;t being made anymore. Believe me, if I knew they were still being made, it would not have taken me a day to go out and buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had so many other nail files along the way.  Trying them out or getting one for the purse, the car, etc.  Even one that was supposed to have ruby crystals imbedded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of them lasts like or has the smooth feel of a Diamond Deb.  I have even used it to smooth plastic and metal that was snagging on something, and it still had the strength and oomph of its early days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting two 8\\&quot; ones and this 6\\&quot; 6 pcak.  Never again will I be without my Diamond Deb!  And I have a bit of my early Christmas shopping done too! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you know what this means.... I will find the missing Diamond Deb the day after I get this shipment.  Sigh.  Oh well, if I do, I will keep that one and give the new ones away. 42 years I&#x27;ve had that file, and I would still prefer it above all others!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore.  Love them</li>
    <li> This particular brand is hard to find. I started using this file many years ago and it is my all time favorite! Have my Mom and daughter hooked onto them as well. The 6&amp;#34; size is just right - there is a smaller size and it is just a little too small, the larger one is just a little too long for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, awesome price, awesome seller! This is absolutely the best fingernail file ever made to date! I bought a six pack and handed them out to my friends. I would definately purchase this item from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I bought these due to the good reviews. I find them adequate but even the &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; side is coarse compared to my old Revlon (which soldiers on, but has gotten nicked up over the years). A good price, however.</li>
    <li> Great set of files for a great price. I have very soft nails and these diamond files are the only ones I can use that do not destroy the edges of my nails. I was so happy to find such a great deal. They last forever (just about), so I was able to share them with friends.</li>
    <li> Wow,  my wife dropped her last nail file in the car and it fell into an impossible crevice.  Half an hour later when we arrived home, there was the packet of 6 new files, and we thank God for the timely shipment and the quality of service as well as the product</li>
    <li> Very fine, qulity poduct.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use these files, perfect for shaping nails after trimming.  Excellent product, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best nail file ever! Recommend to all friends and even given a couple away to friends for no reason other than to give my friends what I think is great!  I also love Amazon with their quick shipping.  While this product cam from a seller, their shipping was great as well.</li>
    <li> Love these nail files. Give for gifts frequently. I would definitely recommend this product. Haven&#x27;t found any others to compare.</li>
    <li> These are the nail files that I&#x27;ve had for 30 years!  I&#x27;m still using my old one, but am glad to have new ones to keep in my purse and share with my family.</li>
    <li> By far the all-time best nail files ever!  I do not want ever to use any other kind of nail file than Diamond Deb!</li>
    <li> I wish I could be these locally.  I live in the woods and even though it is beautiful here I miss the cosmopolitan shopping experience.</li>
    <li> My lady had been looking for this type nail file for sometime.  Was glad I could find it and gave it as a stocking stuffer Christmas present.  She was delighted which makes me very happy.  No complaints whatsoever about this item.</li>
    <li> I have had 3 of these for literally 30 some years but could only find one lately so decided to try to find them and here they are.  Got two for other people and will keep the rest but they will last me a lifetime.  They are excellent!!~</li>
    <li> Great.  Perfect! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Quick shipping. Great files. Make great gifts, every girl should have one of these nail files.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you have to take reviews with a grain of salt. I was dubious of some of the reviewers that claimed they&#x27;ve been using the same Diamon Deb nail file for years but I&#x27;m beginning to think they are all true. I&#x27;ve been using mine every day for 2 months and, so far, it is showing no sign of wear. I bought the 6 pack to give one each to my daughters and granddaughter and they tell me they like them, too. Before getting the Diamon Debs I was using the For Pro Pink with Foam nail files. I like them also but they are only good for one, maybe two, uses and then the grit is worn away. I was looking for something that would last without being too rough on the nails and these seem to be exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent long lasting product. Bought them to smooth out my dogs nails :)</li>
    <li> If this item was made in USA, I would have given it five stars. The old one I have IS made in USA.</li>
    <li> I have hard nails, and thought those durable high grit metal nail files had vanished. What a delight to discover the Diamond Debs. Although these still need a second file to finish smoothing the nails, they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered a pack of 6&amp;#34; files and a pack of 4&amp;#34; ones.  Received instead two packs of the 6&amp;#34;.  Didn&#x27;t seem worth the bother of returning them, but it was a bit annoying.</li>
    <li> These are exactly the ones I was seeking.</li>
    <li> Perfect, they are exactly the same as I remember them when I was younger!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with your service and your product, I will recommend it to all my friends thank you.</li>
    <li> Have used these files for years and never found anything close to their effectiveness!</li>
    <li> I  LIKE  IT  AND  NAILS  LOOKS  BETTER</li>
    <li> Love these nail files!  This is the good old fashion stand by file that I grew up with.  And they are HARD to find!</li>
    <li> These files have been around for a long time.  My wife and my mother truly love these things.</li>
    <li> These files are fantastic! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> For some time I have been looking for nail files that last and do a nice, neat and smooth job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had never heard of this brand but the many positive reviews lead me to try the files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believing it would be a good product, ordered the six pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely pleased and have a file in many areas of our home and expect to purchase another six pack to share with friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip of the file at first appeared to be too sharp to use.  When I decided to give it a try, it was gentle and fabulous to push back cuticle, clean under nails etc.&lt;br /&gt;The file works just as well on thicker toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, I rinse it off, pat dry and put back in its case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!</li>
    <li> The absolute best there is. I bought these to give to guitar playing friends who maintain their nails to perfection. Best deal I&#x27;ve ever seen for Diamon Debs! I still have my original, from the mid-70s and it&#x27;s still very sharp!</li>
    <li> like many f the others i love the old diamond deb files and i know i have had mine old one atleast 30 yrs , have tried other kinds and always went back to my old diamond deb .  the new one is ok , but still no where near as good  , old one made in usa new one china</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s continuing to be hard to find the rounded-end nail file in town. This one fills the bill with the pointed cleaning tip on the bare metal handle side of the file. If you the plastic handled file, make sure you order the right one.</li>
    <li> These work very well and are a great deal.  I certainly can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> These were high quality nail files. Previous nail file purchases from local department stores were terrible. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the the best way to buy these great files for natural nails. I can have one all through the house.</li>
    <li> Great file. Gave out to friends as a gift.  Everybody loves them.  Me too! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product at great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these nail files for decades, until I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.  It&#x27;s great to be able to buy them at a decent price on Amazon.  The fine side isn&#x27;t as fine as I remember but other than that, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> So happy to find these files, I cannot find them locally and nothing else compares. Great price for 6 files, will pass the extras on to friends.</li>
    <li> I have used this file for years.  It is very hard to locate in any store.  I have very strong nails and it works wonders.  The pointed tip at opposite end is absolutely great for going around the cuticle area and leaving a nice clean finish.</li>
    <li> Great, my husband loves them.</li>
    <li> This is 6in.nail fil and  a good size to go in a bag.  I think it&#x27;s the best file ever and I don&#x27;t want any other.</li>
    <li> These are the best files. Period. So glad I found these on Amazon. For some reason they don&#x27;t carry them in stores anymore. They last forever and file very fine which helps nails grow stronger. Excellent product</li>
    <li> These are my favorite nail files.  I buy them in bulk and spread them around the house so they will be at the ready.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this nail file.  My aunt gave my cousins and I this brand several years ago and I have been searching for another one for years.  Finally googled it and found it on amazon.  Yay!!</li>
    <li> Good price, shipped quickly, and received in good order.  These are really good tough nail files and finally one with enough grit on the blade to do the job intended. I am well satisfied, and only wish I&#x27;d found these Diamon nail files years ago.</li>
    <li> these are nice nail files, but the abrasive surface wears off quickly</li>
    <li> I love this diamon deb nail file.  I have used one of these all my life and it is great to carry in your purse for nail emergencies</li>
    <li> Great files. Last forever.  I also use them on my dogs nails to smooth them over between clippings.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using these nail files for years and could not find them anywhere. These files are the very best going, love them! :)</li>
    <li> I have had the original one (made in the USA) which must be 40 years old.  I read some reviews that said this product was not as good as the original.  I disagree.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for years for the Diamon Deb nail files.  I have older ones that were on the verge of needing to be tossed.  These seem to be the same as my older ones and I just love how smooth you can get your nails.  Ladies and Gentlemen don&#x27;t look anywhere else for a nail file this is the one to get.  I bought not only the 6 inch but I got some 4 inch too.  The 4 is perfect for putting in your purse, desk drawer or luggage.  For those times you need to fix a quick break in a nail or a jagged edge. I like the 6 inch in the bathroom for after showers.  I plan on obtaining some 8 Inches for when I need to have a longer file.</li>
    <li> Best fingernail file i&#x27;ve ever used i would buy them again they last for ever never have to be replaced</li>
    <li> Love these so much and they make great little add on gifts.</li>
    <li> They work well, last longer then their sapphire counterparts, so I keeper-order when needed. They also work to polish the tips of silver ear wires before I retired as a craftsman.</li>
    <li> Excellent well-made file</li>
