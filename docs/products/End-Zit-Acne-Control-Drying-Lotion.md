      <li>Couldn&#x27;t get by without this amazing product.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>It does a great job at drying acne up, but the best part is that it does it during the day acting as a coverup.</li>
      <li>I notice that the lighter one works better on her face since she&#x27;s so fair.</li>
      <li>, I just wait for it to heal on its own.</li>
      <li>Concealment is a nice feature as well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t more popular because it&#x27;s an amazing product</li>
      <li>but I have to use a very light hand and pat it out to blend it in.  </li>
      <li>What I liked about it is the applicator, which is so fine that it gives you the ability to control the amount of solution and preciseness with which it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
      <li>Even cystic acne seems to get better.</li>
      <li>This product worked great and the concealer matched my skin tone very well.</li>
      <li>The product comes in more than one tone.</li>
      <li>Im sure</li>
      <li>I get them mostly on my forehead and chin.</li>
      <li>And what more?</li>
      <li>The color matches better than most.</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years on the advice of my esthetician.</li>
      <li>I give it three stars because i wish it was more lotion type.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>It is sulfur based and it blends better for me and doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin.</li>
      <li>no amount of makeup can blend this to look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>i was able to return it without hassle though</li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll love it for acne skin.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>Love love</li>
      <li>(my favorite product).  </li>
      <li>the acne may still be visible but it does a pretty good job and dries the pimples as it suppose to.</li>
      <li>It is pretty runny, but that is a good thing because it doesn&#x27;t appear caked on when under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>There was a time I could not get my acne under control and using this product helped significantly!</li>
      <li>If you have acne then you will love how this clears huge zits up in 1-2 days.</li>
      <li>More importantly, when I put it under my makeup</li>
      <li>The coverage is great, but it doesn&#x27;t really clear up my skin.</li>
      <li>I read so many fantastic reviews and the product</li>
      <li>As with any zit-zapper, it will work best if you attack early, so you have to be pretty aggressive in your zit maintenance.</li>
      <li>easy to use and correct acne mark</li>
      <li>The End-Zit is concentrated sulfur, and I think that&#x27;s what makes it so strong.</li>
      <li>its a fine product...  </li>
      <li>Quick!</li>
      <li>I was amazed and liked it so much I lend End Zit to my teenager.</li>
      <li>: My tone is light, about 1-2 shades darker than ivory.</li>
      <li>It worked great then when I was younger</li>
      <li>Really works and blends nice</li>
      <li>I wish this product had been available when I was in my teens.</li>
      <li>But if you do the blending, it will look fantastic and stay on all day.</li>
      <li>On most days it is the only thing I have on besides a good moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It covers great AND helps to dry pimples up</li>
      <li>A bit too orangey to actually be able to use, other than that its good for healing pimples faster</li>
      <li>I rarely put on full face make-up anymore...</li>
      <li>The good news is, it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Plus it doubled fairly well as a cover up (although it will probably be too dark for very fair skin to not cover it with a little makeup).  </li>
      <li>This is great as a concealer for my acne, it certainly doesn&#x27;t dry and flake off.  </li>
      <li>The only acne treatment that has worked (amazingly)</li>
      <li>and I love the natural skin tone they have now.  </li>
      <li>you can feel the cooling effect like its cleaning the zit right away..</li>
      <li>I love this product because it works quickly &amp; efficiently to help rid my skin of the occasional blemish.</li>
      <li>I thought this one would give me a quick heal of the problem (particularly this month!)</li>
      <li>I like to mix it with moisturizer or other acne leave-on lotions, specifically, one I got from my dermatologist:  \\&quot;sulfacetamide sodium topical suspension USP, 10%.\\&quot; This is basically a sulfur lotion that is moisturizing, and it&#x27;s very good.</li>
      <li>Works pretty well at reducing blemishes, especially new ones.</li>
      <li>The reason i say its okay is because i wish it was an actual lotion type to blend in because it doesnt blend in like lotion</li>
      <li>drys really fast!</li>
      <li>I do remember that the white one seemed to work better than the tinted bottle.  </li>
      <li>but this is very helpful for covering the things up!</li>
      <li>It blends pretty well, like a makeup.</li>
      <li>pretty</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>Better for when one is just starting to form or if you want to conceal a hot spot.</li>
      <li>Thanks End-Zit!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why so many reviewers consider this to be a great way to cover up pimples, because for me it just looked dry and caked.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this after using a similar product that was actually pink (for use overnight).  They work very similarly, but because this one is tinted a skin tone you can actually wear it during the day, too, which for me helped dry out blemishes more quickly.  Plus it doubled fairly well as a cover up (although it will probably be too dark for very fair skin to not cover it with a little makeup).  Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because I prefer an all natural product (which could be easily formulated for this type of product).  But definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It is one of the very few that will actually cover the red and not show through.  It also seems to help them dry up faster.  I have to use a acne wash still but this is very helpful for covering the things up!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get by without this amazing product. There was a time I could not get my acne under control and using this product helped significantly! More importantly, when I put it under my makeup I had the confidence to leave the house. I suffer from adult acne and am extremely self conscious about my break outs. I have two bottles now, one in my bag (just in case) and one in my makeup bag at home. A friend of mine recommended it and I would recommend it to anyone in need of coverage and acne fighting assistance!</li>
    <li> Our secret weapon for the clearest skin !!</li>
    <li> It does just what it says it will do.  It covers the zits and helps to dry them out at the same time.  I rarely put on full face make-up anymore...I just cover the zits and I&#x27;m good to go.  Be sure to blend it in a little bit though or it looks like you have something on your face.</li>
    <li> I never had break outs until when I turn 44. I was breaking out just around my mouth and was getting worse as time went by. I was told it is a hormonal thing and couldn&#x27;t find any solution. I found this product after reading the reviews and OMG....I just love it. I don&#x27;t think I can live without it  My skin is clear of zits and it prevents. Love love</li>
    <li> I just received it a few days ago. Already, it&#x27;s clearing up my little breakouts. It blends pretty well, like a makeup. Of course, it&#x27;s more dry. I like to mix it with moisturizer or other acne leave-on lotions, specifically, one I got from my dermatologist:  \\&quot;sulfacetamide sodium topical suspension USP, 10%.\\&quot; This is basically a sulfur lotion that is moisturizing, and it&#x27;s very good. Mixing it with this sulfur product, End-Zit, seems to make it stronger, even though the End-Zit is only 5%. The End-Zit is concentrated sulfur, and I think that&#x27;s what makes it so strong. Try it. I think you&#x27;ll love it for acne skin.</li>
    <li> I remember this from using years ago.  It worked great then when I was younger I had serious acne, not so much now just the occasional break outs.  I do remember that the white one seemed to work better than the tinted bottle.  I will order this to help with those occasional bumps that pop up.</li>
    <li> This product worked great and the concealer matched my skin tone very well. Requires very few applications to get rid of acne. I definitely will be buying this again and recommending this product to others. Thanks End-Zit!</li>
    <li> great buy it really does the job clearing up blemishes...</li>
    <li> The reason i say its okay is because i wish it was an actual lotion type to blend in because it doesnt blend in like lotion but it works on a pimple tho... Id rather return to using murad. I give it three stars because i wish it was more lotion type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 5 days now and I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it! It does a great job at drying acne up, but the best part is that it does it during the day acting as a coverup. I don&#x27;t even need to use my normal makeup when I use this. It covers so well. It also reduces redness and inflammation caused by acne. And it hasn&#x27;t overly dried my skin like I expected. Wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> Great to treat/cover up acne. Even cystic acne seems to get better.</li>
    <li> works really well you can feel the cooling effect like its cleaning the zit right away.. drys really fast! good color!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The applicator is a plastic wand that allows you to limit the amount of product you put on a blemish, keeping waste at a minimum and a more precise application.&lt;br /&gt;- To call this a lotion is a bit of a stretch. It is pretty runny, but that is a good thing because it doesn&#x27;t appear caked on when under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;- The color matches better than most. It dries a little light for me but I would prefer that than drying too dark. BTW: My tone is light, about 1-2 shades darker than ivory. The lotion does not dry pink! I have another product that dries light pink and no amount of makeup can blend this to look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;- This product works and it is not overly drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells a little like sulfur upon application. However, this disappears when it has dried.&lt;br /&gt;- Cost more than the average over the counter product. The good news is, it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is for acne only so don&#x27;t use it all over the face as it will dry out your skin. This is good to cover up some blemishes. the acne may still be visible but it does a pretty good job and dries the pimples as it suppose to. I use it often instead of my regular foundation. It has a foundation like substance in the bottom and a liquid. You have to shake it to mix it. Don&#x27;t apply the liquid only.</li>
    <li> Great product and came in good condition and cleared my skin up. I advise anyone to use this product because it works.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Better than any other spot treatment I have tried. You do need to shake it very wekk prior to use though.</li>
    <li> It does an alright job!  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup on my face (because of acne) so I didn&#x27;t end up using this as much as I thought it would -- because without makeup on top, it looks really obvious.  But it does feel drying, in a good way, and it basically does what it says it does.  Not a miracle worker, though.</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended and it works well covering the blemish as well as helping the blemish to heal.</li>
    <li> Covers and helps the healing process.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It is the only topical that has helped stop my menopausal acne.  I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. As with any zit-zapper, it will work best if you attack early, so you have to be pretty aggressive in your zit maintenance. It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but I like that the light/medium blends almost invisibly into my skin, so I&#x27;m able to wear it on my days off instead of foundation, without my face looking Barbie-doll pink. It is a little drying, but I haven&#x27;t experienced anything too horrifying. No layers of skin peeling off, making me look like something out of a zombie movie. Anyone who has spent years battling acne knows exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. You also know what it&#x27;s like to kid yourself that walking around smelling like sulphur isn&#x27;t so bad, but I won&#x27;t lie to you. You will smell like sulphur a little bit, although I think it&#x27;s worth it, especially if you&#x27;re a victim of those giant painful cysts that tend to hang around for weeks if not months. Catch them early enough and they most likely won&#x27;t survive more than a few days. Sometimes they disappear overnight. Another product I highly recommend for this type of acne is the Aztec Healing Clay mask, also sold on Amazon. Use it a couple of times a week and it will make a big difference. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Good cover-up for acne spots while treating them</li>
    <li> This is my go-to product for zits. I am an adult and still have the occasional, embarrassing pimples. I am fair skinned, so I use the lighter version of this product. It blends in well and hides the pimples, while drying up zits and accelerating their demise. I wish this product had been available when I was in my teens.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really covers my daughter&#x27;s acne.  She tells me that she loves how this product covers the redness of the acne therefore not making her feel like everyone is staring at the acne.  The product comes in more than one tone. I bought 2 (the light/medium and the medium/dark)....I notice that the lighter one works better on her face since she&#x27;s so fair. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to cover up their acne.</li>
    <li> Really works and blends nice</li>
    <li> This is good for blending on into your face as you put on your make up or foundation for hiding blemishes. But didn&#x27;t work for me. Not for big pimple like I have a very persistent one that like to grow big.&lt;br /&gt; For a background, I always have a one and only zit anywhere on my face almost every month&lt;br /&gt;for as long as I can remember. I thought this one would give me a quick heal of the problem (particularly this month!) like I was hoping. I&#x27;m a proactive user as of the moment for  say 2-3 yrs now, it doesn&#x27;t even work for me a hundred percent but I still use it. It does keep my face smoother. But it doesn&#x27;t get rid of my zit that comes after or before my period. And that is what I&#x27;m looking for, something that is not for the entire face but something that would stop or prevent my pimple to become big. I don&#x27;t have this small&lt;br /&gt;stubborn pimples that others like to get rid of, but my problem is this one that would turn into big zit on my face and last like 8--10 days of giving me an embarrassment when I go out but I really need to to pick up my kids or do errands for example that I just suck it up and ignore the looks from people. Though im so tired of it coz it&#x27;s embarrassing! But what can I do.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry that this product is not working for me so I&#x27;m going to say I just keep on looking.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t always give reviews but I want to share my disappointment. Maybe it works for others Quick! But not for all!&lt;br /&gt;This picture was taken last Friday and we went out to pizza dinner with my In laws and this review is today is Friday and it is still big. I didn&#x27;t want to come but then again I just have to. The third picture shown was taken after a week and you can see it is still big.&lt;br /&gt;I kept on putting the end-zit several times a day and to no avail, I just wait for it to heal on its own. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Just place a patch of this stuff on any pimple. Gone. Done.</li>
    <li> Save ur money and buy Acnomel tinted adult acne cream u can get 3 tubes for ~$27 and it contains 8% sulfur, vs this 5% sulfur, and u can use it as a concealer because it&#x27;s tinted (and unlike this stuff it doesn&#x27;t dry instantly and can be easily blended). Would I buy this product against no way josé.</li>
    <li> easy to use and correct acne mark</li>
    <li> I was using Mario Badescu drying Lotion prior to trying this one. I think this works much better and it is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Love this but I would never wear it during the day lol</li>
    <li> I use this as a spot treatment after using [[ASIN:B00411B4CC Pomada De Azufre Sulfur Ointment 2.6 Oz Acne Cream De La Cruz]] (my favorite product).  I can use it under my makeup but I have to use a very light hand and pat it out to blend it in.  I also have [[ASIN:B0017SWIU4 Mario Badescu Mario Badescu Drying Lotion]] both products work about the same for me the only difference is with the End-zit I can use during the day also.  Good product if I have a problem area starting (or I think it is starting) I just pat this on it and it is usually gone in a day or 2 without becoming a huge problem.</li>
    <li> This sulfur will dry your skin out so it heals faster. I found this particular product doesn&#x27;t blend very well with my skin. It has a strange consistency to it too. It&#x27;s like whatever is in the bottle doesn&#x27;t mix well so you have the shake the devil out of it and apply it before it separates. Just seems weird to me. I prefer to use \\&quot;Liquimat\\&quot;. It is sulfur based and it blends better for me and doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin. Anyway, you never really know about these things till you try them. So I can&#x27;t say if you should or shouldn&#x27;t try this one. It just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The only thing id recommend is to get the white too and mix it if you are paler. That way it doesn&#x27;t show under makeup or can just serve as makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for spot treating breakouts.  I can&#x27;t really speak about the coverup properties, as I don&#x27;t leave the house with it on.  The smell really is pretty bad, but that is to be expected.  Read the directions carefully.</li>
    <li> I have worst acne now in my 40s than when I was a teenager.  I get them mostly on my forehead and chin. I tried a couple of the OTC acne creams and they just leave red, itchy, dry spots on my acne.  End Zit could actually eliminate the pimple over night.  I was amazed and liked it so much I lend End Zit to my teenager.</li>
    <li> Works well on all skin types and I find that it clears up acne in a couple of days.  Concealment is a nice feature as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a decade and love it very much although it is a little pricey I still recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  This is the third time I have ordered it.  On most days it is the only thing I have on besides a good moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 50&#x27;s and still get zits...how annoying!  I don&#x27;t like wearing make-up but wanted something to cover up the blemishes.  This stuff is fantastic!  It covers great AND helps to dry pimples up FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to use just a dab then blend it a bit after several seconds.  If you don&#x27;t do this you will look like you have a blob of chalk on your skin.  But if you do the blending, it will look fantastic and stay on all day.</li>
    <li> While covering blemishes and concealing them this product didn&#x27;t do much in terms of healing or reducing inflammation and caused significant dryness  making it harder to cover and hide the blemishes.  I stopped using it after a week, because while it didn&#x27;t make things better for me, it was also making things worse because I stopped using other products.  What I liked about it is the applicator, which is so fine that it gives you the ability to control the amount of solution and preciseness with which it&#x27;s applied.  This product was recommended by a friend but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  It just wasn&#x27;t working as we&#x27;ll for me.</li>
    <li> The only spot treatment I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works. My skin has been so much clearer since I started using this. I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t more popular because it&#x27;s an amazing product</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It covers well and will dry out pimples.</li>
    <li> I read so many fantastic reviews and the product is so inexpensive I decided to try it out. The coverage is great, but it doesn&#x27;t really clear up my skin. And it smells horrible. Be warned, if you use it several days in a row, it will dry out the surrounding skin and then this will stick out like a sore thumb when you apply it. But the coverage really is good.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it works quickly &amp; efficiently to help rid my skin of the occasional blemish. The tint in the lotion helps to cover too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with cystic acne lately which is driving me crazy.  I&#x27;ve been trying lots of products to both treat and cover it.  Regarding covering, I have not had much luck.  But this product actually covers the acne better than actual makeup coverups!!!! This one matches perfectly with my cool-tone ivory skin tone.  When purchasing foundation I usually end up getting the darkest ivory shade but still I am fairer than medium - if that helps you understand my skin tone.  If this product actually does something to shrink or dry up the acne bonus points!!! Haven&#x27;t had it quite long enough to comment on that though.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> just a dot of this lotion on any pimple, and it&#x27;s gone the next day.  pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;take this with me everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this for my teenage son and myself to help cover irritating acne and it works perfect.  My son is happy with it as well.</li>
    <li> I always purchased this item at a beauty store, but Amazon has come through again!!  This is great as a concealer for my acne, it certainly doesn&#x27;t dry and flake off.  Use just a tad to cover up areas of trouble!!</li>
    <li> I had found this several years ago at a local store.  Then never found it again. It is the best thing I have ever tried in all my years.  I was so excited to find it on Amazon!  It was pink before and I love the natural skin tone they have now.  If you have acne then you will love how this clears huge zits up in 1-2 days.</li>
    <li> EndZit does just that.  It dries up a break out, very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It is good for teens as well as Moms &amp; Grandmoms.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommemd this product.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d find an acne lotion that can also act as a legit concealer, but here this is. No only did this dried up the hard painful bumps in the area between my lower lip and chin, but it also meanwhile concealed the redness beautifully. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this and other brands like L&#x27;Oreal because it does such a nice job. And what more? Unlike other concealers, not only do you not have to take if off at night when you sleep, it is encouraged for you to apply it often! While not a qualm with me, I can see other people being turned off by the sulfur smell, but I guarantee you you&#x27;ll be used to it soon enough, and might even enjoy it somewhat. Excellent product, one of the best acne treatment I&#x27;ve ever bought. 10/10</li>
    <li> Works pretty well at reducing blemishes, especially new ones. They don&#x27;t go magically go away completely, but are definitely minimized quickly and clear up in a few days. Unlike the pink stuff, the color allows me to wear it during the day when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup, but it also provides a good base under makeup that stays in place all day. I don&#x27;t have to touch up during the day.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it did nothing to help my cystic acne. I&#x27;m not sure why so many reviewers consider this to be a great way to cover up pimples, because for me it just looked dry and caked. The only acne treatment that has worked (amazingly) well for me is the acne.org Treatment, which is also sold on this site. Do yourself a favor- save your money and skip this product.</li>
    <li> A bit too orangey to actually be able to use, other than that its good for healing pimples faster</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says although unfortunately it has parabens which is a bummer. I&#x27;m going to keep it because it does work although will try not to use it to often.</li>
    <li> My teenagers use this constantly. They seem very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Mine didnt have any type of seal or protective covering on it... I was afraid to use it in case it was returned or contaminated.  Im sure its a fine product...  i was able to return it without hassle though so Im happy!</li>
    <li> Works great until the bottle dries up (about 3 months). Then you are left with medicated cake. Does not work if you have already popped a pimple. Better for when one is just starting to form or if you want to conceal a hot spot.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years on the advice of my esthetician. It works! It blends fairly easily; I usually have to tap it on my skin and then blend for fuller coverage. The only negatives are the smell and that the product separates and tends to clump, regardless of how often I shake it.</li>
    <li> Overpriced, doesn&#x27;t work, and it makes the affected area look flaky.</li>
    <li> Works great. Wish it was clear.</li>
</ol>
