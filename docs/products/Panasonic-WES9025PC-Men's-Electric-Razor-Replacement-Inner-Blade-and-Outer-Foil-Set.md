<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works just fine for my electric razor.  I&#x27;d recommend changing once a year. Blades seem to start getting dull after a year or so.</li>
    <li> The 2nd replacement is excellent............</li>
    <li> Exact fit and easy to install.  Noticed a difference right away as compared to the old blades.  A bit expensive though, but what are you going to do...</li>
    <li> Easy to take for granted that out foils and blades for electric shavers need to be replaced annually, but spending the money to do so makes it almost a new razor. They ARE well made Panasonic branded products and can take a pretty good daily workout dealing my beard, and I have been known to &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; the out foil when cleaning the razor by dropping it on the shower floor. That said, I&#x27;d rate these products five stars, but they ARE an expensive purchase no matter how much better they make an already good electric razor. Same frustration as buying a new printer and then buying expensive replacement ink cartridges... How many times are you actually &amp;#34;buying&amp;#34; the razor when you replace expensive, necessary components?</li>
    <li> Sharp razor and can be used up to one year.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set a little less than a year ago and came back to possibly order another set. It is now twice the price I paid a year ago. 80 dollars for a shaver blade set? You have to be kidding me. I will look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Electric razor like new again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no shaving expert, but these replacement parts were just what my shaver needed to make it just like new.</li>
    <li> I love Panansonic wet/drive shavers.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is the costly replacement parts.&lt;br /&gt;I get about 2-3 use out of Panasonic wet/dry razor&lt;br /&gt;and to me its worth replacing blades 1-2 times before getting a new&lt;br /&gt;razor all together if you do the math. Nothing at least to me works as well&lt;br /&gt;in the shower.</li>
    <li> The LA-93k is probably the best razor I&#x27;ve owned.  It gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in my life - very smooth with almost no irritation and I have fairly sensitive skin.  I shave dry after taking my shower and I find that this gives me the best results.  I don&#x27;t have to clean the razor as often because the clippings are not soiled with my skin&#x27;s oils.  When I do clean the razor, I use the shaver&#x27;s base along with the cleaning cartridges.  This is only after about a month of regular use, as I tap out the majority of the clippings into the sink after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set can last up to 3 years in my experience.  I had to replace the foil for the first time since purchasing the razor this past May, 2013.  I&#x27;m going to see how long my second set lasts and might update this review accordingly.</li>
    <li> Great value for replacement blades. Other vendors are much more expensive.</li>
    <li> Great price on these. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> Fits the razor perfectly as expected. These blades do get dull. For me they last about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Renew my blade and keeps my razor clean!</li>
    <li> The wear of the blade escapes notice until they&#x27;re replaced - it&#x27;s a new razor all over again.  Be sure to replace BOTH the blades and the foil, as replacing only one or the other does not provide the same renewal, and the replacement will not be appreciated.</li>
    <li> Ideal spares to have handy before your blades and heads on your razor lose their effectiveness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how a new inner blade and foil set makes your shave feel like brand new again.&lt;br /&gt;To enjoy that close shave feeling, make sure you clean your head after each use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t changed it yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.</li>
    <li> Great product and love that it is on subscription so I never have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> Good price. Excellent razor.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t realize how dull your old blades are until you throw on a new one... what a difference.  Don&#x27;t drag them out too long, and change a little more often, and you&#x27;ll still love your razor two years later.</li>
    <li> The replacement Foil and blades did the job! My Panasonic electric razor was shaving me dull. Put in the new set and it&#x27;s just like brand new again. I wish the blades would last longer than a year but that&#x27;s what happened. Highly recommend NOT getting a new Panasonoc razor, but getting the replacement foil and blades. With my model shaver this did the trick for around $45.00 bucks!</li>
    <li> Product received in excellent packaging and works like expected.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. Just ocassionally replace the cutters and foil and it&#x27;s good to go for another year. Yet again quick, excellent service from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This replacement set works fine and provides a clean close shave - what more can I really say. Wish it were cheaper.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace in a minute; definitely improves shaving results.</li>
    <li> Refreshed my electric razor.  This has been the best electric razor i have ever owned.  Highly recommend the panasonic brand razors to everyone for a close shave, and minimizes irritation.</li>
    <li> Just tried this and did not realize I had to change the blades at first.  Razor works like new and I learned you need to change them each year.</li>
    <li> Purchased this set for future replacement. When I need these parts I will know that I have them. Great price.</li>
    <li> Dad loves it!  Close shave, got extra blades in case the discontinue this.</li>
    <li> Works well. It improved the shaving performance significantly. It worked as promised and was delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price too high though, for replacement parts!</li>
    <li> New blades work wonders. So much smoother with the new blades, Wil not wait as long to change them next time.</li>
    <li> very pricey  but that&#x27;s panasonics fault.  Works great though</li>
    <li> I put off buying this for 2 years because every time I saw it was about fifty bucks. I figured I could get a new razor for just a little more. I finally used a gift card somebody got me and boy was I surprised. It shaved MUCH better than the old blades. They slowly got dull and I never noticed. I can shave much faster now.</li>
    <li> I have replaced the foil and blades in my [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV Multi Flex Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver, Silver]].  Panasonic WES9025PC Replacement Foil and Blades fit my shaver perfectly and work as expected.  The only downside is the high price.  However, I like my LA63 shaver and intend to keep it for a while, so I did not have any other options, but purchase this product.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and blades for the ES-LA63 make it run like new.   The price is much more reasonable than the replacement set for the 8249!    I was a long time Braun user, until I switched to the newer Panasonic Arc shavers.  There is just no comparison.</li>
    <li> arrived promptly and safely and was of good quality, thanks soo much. jack</li>
    <li> The Panasonic Arc 5 shaver is outstanding for both wet and dry shaving.  The blades usually last about 4-6 months.  My replacements have been easy to install and maintain.</li>
    <li> It did what it was expected to do for a clean shave.  I will definitely order again the next time I need replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I had put off replacing the foil and blades well beyond what is reasonable... I&#x27;ve lately prefered a double edge razor, feather or astra blades, shaving soap and shaving brush  Got these to update the Panasonic ES-LA63 and its back to being quite usable again.  Shave with it in the shower and it is a good shave.  Not as great as with the DE and hot lather, but certainly easier and less hassle for travel.</li>
    <li> Always nice to have a close shave</li>
    <li> Works well. Razor like new. This is the second time I have replaced cutters and screen in two years.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and good Price</li>
    <li> Works just like a new one.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great service.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here as this is something you need to replace every 12-18 months as a part of normal maintenance.  I consider it somewhat expensive and the parts should last longer in my opinion.  It&#x27;s also annoying how the reminder on the shaver to replace these items seemingly shows up whenever it wants to regardless if they really need to be changed or not.</li>
    <li> No issues with prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I love this razor and the replacement foil and blades are of excellent quality.  Very easy to replace by just snapping the old ones out and the new ones in.  They make a big improvement in the closeness of the shave and the number of passes it takes to get there.  My only reason for less than 5 stars is that the annual cost for this set seems high to me.</li>
    <li> Almost $50 is a bit pricy to replace the blades and foil, but I must say it did help. I went a really long time on my original blades and foil on my ES-LA93-K. I bought that razor in January of 2011, and I just replaced the blades/foil for the first time (August 2013). So it lasted me over 2 1/2 years. And it was actually still cutting fine, it just wasn&#x27;t as sharp as it used to be so it took a little longer to shave. With the new blades I can tell its sharper and I can shave quicker. Hopefully this set lasts me another 2+ years. If so, I guess $50 every 2+ years isn&#x27;t so bad after all.</li>
    <li> Replacement for existing item.</li>
    <li> My three year old razor is now just like new, giving me a great, close shave.  New blades and shaving head really made a difference.</li>
    <li> Made my shaver work like new again!  Just take care to order the proper one for your shaver by the photos and not the description.</li>
    <li> The razor did not work for me at all, infact it ruined my face for almost a week. I will not recommend this replacement to anyone. It&#x27;s no where close to the original --</li>
    <li> This is just like buying a new razor . Mine was beginning to pull my whiskers and I was just about to toss it and get a new razor all together . Glad I didn&#x27;t because that would have cost me $200 vs $45</li>
    <li> I received the package as expected, and I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This kit works for the Panasonic ES-LA63 4-foil razor. I was previously looking for a new razor after mine appeared to be doing a poor job of shaving my face. I bought mine around August 2012. My wife&#x27;s face is very sensitive to my beard stubble, so I shave every day to not irritate her skin. Shaving has gotten to be uncomfortable because I needed to press the razor close against my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon this as a way of restoring the former glory of old razors and boy does it work. Replacing the blades and foil is easy (instructions are included) and the razor feels exactly like when I bought it. My old Panasonic seems to glide across my face again and does a far better job of shaving. I strongly recommend this for anyone who was in my situation and is thinking of purchasing a new razor.</li>
    <li> Product was ok.  Doesn&#x27;t stay very sharp.  Need better instructions for installing foil.</li>
    <li> We checked out the reviews to see if anyone used this for their heads. People said it worked great. It does NOT work great for the head. For about 1 week it works great. SO if you have 50 bucks a week to replace the heads, go for it but we don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Have been using these blades for over 5 years and have found them to be good quality, long lasting blades.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It was received when promised and is well constructed and at a reasonable price.  Will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> easy to install&lt;br /&gt;did noticeably improve the performance of my shaver&lt;br /&gt;recommended annual maintenance is the right thing to do</li>
    <li> I was very disapointed in the closeness of my shave.  I honestly think I had a closer shave with my old Norelo.  I bought the replacement blade set hoping it would improve the closeness.  Couldn&#x27;t tell hardly any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recomend this replacement.</li>
    <li> Made my 18 month old electric razor shave like a new razor.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, and try to replace the head and blades once a year (perhaps should be more often, but this seems to work).  These fit right in and lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> Wrong product was sent,&lt;br /&gt;As I was leaving the USA, couldn&#x27;t return the item. Be wary that the code on the advertised product is not the same as the one received.</li>
    <li> Wow... these things are shockingly expensive!  But if you&#x27;ve got THAT electronic razor, and it&#x27;s been a year... and you need new blades... what are you going to do?  You&#x27;re going to curse Panasonic under your breath for their price-gouging, and buy this anyway... because you need it.  It does work well.</li>
    <li> Quality is perfect and it shaves very well...but the price is roughly half of what I paid for the whole electric shaver new.&lt;br /&gt;This foil and blade set will outlast the Remington brand hands down, within 3 months the Remington will have wore holes in the foil whereas with the Panasonic the foil never has had a hole wore in it and the blades seem to stay sharp about a year.</li>
    <li> Looks like rocket science. Very cool. Just as cool as my new Panasonic shaver!!! I like life! I like USA!</li>
    <li> RECEIVED THIS ITEM IN GOOD CONDITION AND AS STATED, NEW IN PACKAGE. I HAVE NOT USED IT AS YET BUT IT IS THE SAME ITEM I NEED TO REPLACE MY OLD BLADES.</li>
    <li> the blades are super thin and very Sharp, though protected as in all electric shaving machines, results are a very nice shave indeed</li>
    <li> The replacements were of first quality.  The delivery was fast and pricing very reasonable.  Have purchased several times before and just keep the ole Panasonic shaving.</li>
    <li> Great price for the set.</li>
    <li> My Dog broke my old faceplate and damaged a blade. Came in right on time and fit my razor perfectly.</li>
    <li> These are the exact same blades as my razor had out of the box, and yet... they do not seem to be working as well.  When I first bought my razor I got a much closer shave.  Recently I felt as if the blades were performing poorly, and I realized I had not changed them in over 12 months so I went out and found these.  After replacing my original blades with these (which are exactly the same in design), I am noticing an improvement in shave closeness, BUT it is still not coming close to the original shave I got with the razor fresh out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me wonder if these are as high a quality as the originals, even though they look identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I was expecting more.  I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Makes that old razor come to life again. After all, you spent at least $150 on the razor, every so often it needs a little maintenance. Just a word of advice though...BF tried a non-panasonic brand replacement and it just wasn&#x27;t as good. Don&#x27;t skimp, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
    <li> I am not required to fill in these reviews when I shop at a local store; I simply do not return if something is wrong.</li>
    <li> Vital in keeping your razor running top notch. Just wish blades would not be 1/2 the cost of the razor.</li>
    <li> I had not replaced anything on my panasonic shaver since i bought it for christmas 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt realize how much easier/faster/better the shave was when the foil and blades were new.&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this thinking about renewing your shaver just do it, youll thank me later.</li>
    <li> Wish the razor head would last longer.  It does give a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Panasonic shaver for years now.  Makes for a clean, quick  shave with no razor burn.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement. Easy to install and works just fine.</li>
    <li> Fair price for replacement set for the foil and blades for the Panasonic shaver. Easy to install and replace the old blades and foil.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I ever owned. Very close shave from a well made product.  I would highly recommend this to anyone .</li>
    <li> Made my shaver like new. Great product . Gives me a nice clean and close shave. Should of done this a long Imelda ago.</li>
    <li> does the job . replace my old one it work like brand new not the first used but after 3 or 4 shave when they break in then it is a wonderful shaver.</li>
    <li> did not get to use it. There was nothing wrong with it. Thank you very much and have a happy Christmas.</li>
    <li> great product for a tough beard very good but long hair trimmer not very good. overall very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> great replacement for the original inner blade..my shaver feels like new again..little pricey but gets the job done nice &amp; neat!!!</li>
    <li> Works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my dad to replace his blades on his travel razor after he was having a hard time finding this set locally.  He was very happy with this set and the fact that it was quite a bit cheaper than he had gotten his last one locally. Replacing his blades got rid of the razor burn problem he was having with his shaver so all in all he wished he had asked me to order this for him sooner.  Now that he knows these are available from Amazon he&#x27;ll be ordering them before his razor can get to the point where it&#x27;s giving him a bad shave.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a two months it is now dull I will have to get a new one</li>
    <li> this  was  the  right  blades</li>
    <li> These blades and comb seem to fall short of the original.  They tug at my beard during shaving and do not always give a close shave.</li>
    <li> It is good quality, no problems at all. Perfect fit as well. Unfortunately the noise didn&#x27;t change as I though it would, but I guess that&#x27;s a matter of design. I have an experience with older models that got much quieter after replacement of the head.</li>
    <li> New product professionally packed and shipped.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> Great replacement foil and blades for an already great wet/dry shaver.  The only electric shaver to use.  Great in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this order and the merchant&#x27;s service. I received the item as promised and shipping was speedy.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, gives the closest and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had! Highly recommended; battery lasts more than a week, too.</li>
    <li> This the correct part for my shaver.  This was hard to find because the shaver model is new.  The part came quickly.</li>
    <li> Brand new in the package, this was exactly what I needed.  Now I get a nice clean shave again, just like it&#x27;s a brand new shaver.  It&#x27;s very important to change the heads and the screen, or it starts ripping hair out of your face instead of cutting it.  That gives you rough and red bumps, especially on your neck.</li>
    <li> This came quickly and I was very happy because it was exactly what I was looking for. I am glad that I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store and could order online.</li>
    <li> THEY DONT LAST VERY LONG AND SEEM LIKE THEY SHOULD COST 75% LESS FOR WHAT YOU GET. BUT THEY ARE GOOD BLADES JUST TOO EXPENSIVE</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I replaced the foil and blades after about one year. This is the first electric razor I have owned and was unfamiliar with what to expect from it over time. Over the last few months, it became more difficult to get a close shave and the foil seemed to get very hot.  Since replacing the foil and blades, the shaver works as well as when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor&#x27;s instructions recommend replacing the foil annually and the blades every two years. For about $50 dollars I replaced both at one year. My reasoning was that disposable blades and lather used to cost me much more annually.</li>
    <li> It is a very good replacement for the Panasonic shaver. Worth every penny spent. I will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> Factory replacement parts to keep my electric razor going strong for a few more years. Delivery was speedy and price was right.</li>
    <li> If you have thicker/higher density stubble, and shave daily (or even every two days), you need to replace these about every 18 months. I go through phases of shaving daily and not shaving for months, so I replaced these after about two years. But it seems that maybe that was too late. My hair was getting tugged, and skin irritated, so I guess it was time to replace them. And they really do make a difference. I was ok with the price (~$47) but I don&#x27;t know that I want to keep using an electric razor, so that may be the only time I replace them. Very easy to switch out, took just a minute or so.</li>
    <li> A new foil and cutting block always makes the shaver run like new. The shaver cuts SO closely and smoothly!</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement blades. Easy to install (took less than 1 minute). Work well, like having a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I hate the fact that I had to replace my first blade before I needed to.  The original blade cover tore a bit which made them useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this lasts lest than a year, I may have to look at another company besides Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  I used the Norelco razors and really like them; however, the new design causes the top to pop off while shaving.</li>
    <li> I put off getting new blades and foil for my razor thinking it was just a scam to get more money out of you. It had been at least 2 years since I bought the razor and thought I might see if it really did give me a better shave. Let me tell you, it not only gave me a better shave it decreased my shave time back to around 3 minutes. That means I am actually saving my battery too because I can get 10 shaves per recharge again instead of 5 that I was getting. (it was taking 5 plus minutes to get a good shave) This doesn&#x27;t necessarily reflect on the place where I bought it from since I believe the product will do the same from whoever you buy it from. I might consider buying these regularly as my shaving time increases. Hope this helps some people sitting on the fence about buying these items!</li>
    <li> If you own this great shaver, you already know what a close shave it gives.  I replaced the foil and blade after 1.5 years.  Doing so brought the razor back up to it origenal close shave feel.</li>
    <li> As described, like original product.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my shave like new. Recommend changing foil and blade as this gives better shaving exp.</li>
    <li> I started out, years ago, with Norelco. Then about 10 years ago, a salesmen talked me into the Panasonic.  It worked pretty good so I bought another a few year latter and it seemed to work a little bit better.  This model however is in a class by its self. I wondered why they put a timer in the handle; now I know.  You can shave fast and clean with this shaver than anything I have tried.  This was the only way to prove it.  I am really impressed that the Panasonics are getting better and better.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave, don&#x27;t have to shave for two days now. Old razor blades  lasted over 3 yrs.</li>
    <li> Works well and good price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Just the thing to make your Panasonic razor cut like new again!</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement.  Easy to figure out, ut at first it was&#x27;t obvious,  This is a great eelctric razor, and the replacement makes in brand new all over again.</li>
    <li> does what it is made for - a comfortable close shave</li>
    <li> My husband loves this</li>
    <li> l bought this to go with my new shaver but have not yet taken it out of its blister card.  From what I can tell it is an exact replacement for the out foil and blade set and will be ready for use when I need it.</li>
    <li> used razor for 3-4 years. Great shave</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service, have been using Panasonic shavers for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> They say to replace these every 6 months.  I&#x27;ve had the same pair on my razor for over two years.  Secondly, when I shave in the shower, it literally feels like I don&#x27;t have any facial hair at all.  In fact, it&#x27;s a little too close.  I can&#x27;t shave the next day because there&#x27;s not enough hair.  This is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Renews your razor to just like new. Love this razor for shaven the noggin!</li>
    <li> These are original Panasonic blades in original factory packaging.  Very simple to change (30 seconds) and afterwards my razor performed like new.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these blades a couple times and the quality is consistently high, matching the blades included with the razor.  With the foil, the result is a smooth and painless shave.  Even though they are expensive, it is a lot cheaper than replacing the whole unit, which has held good battery life for years.</li>
    <li> I have owned this razor about 1.5 years. I have to replace this head about every 3 months.  I can tell it needs new blades and foil when it starts to bite my face while shaving wet with gel.  I don&#x27;t know what is going on with these replacements, but they are not working for me.  I just went to Panasonic direct and ordered a set.  So I will see how they work out.  (40.00 ) shipped. on sale</li>
    <li> Got it quick and product is as expected!</li>
    <li> works great, 15 seconds to replace</li>
    <li> Makes the razor work like new!</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was hoping for.  The kit gave new life to my shaver.  The blades were easy to put in and are good and sharp.</li>
    <li> Was as described worked perfectly</li>
    <li> Boy, I love this shaver. Completely dry shaving is comfortable. Use electric shaver lotion as a supplement for an even smoother shave.  Decide you want to use the shaver as a wet shaver, using water-activated lotion . . . oh baby. It doesn&#x27;t get better than this. This replacement head is still sitting in my drawer; the original head unit is still going strong 15 months later. It appears to be a perfect match for the original.</li>
    <li> good product. no complaints.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping on an item that has kept  my panasonic like new.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the most bang for the buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve read some folks here criticize the high price of this replacement set, I personally feel that the quality of the shave these blades and foil give is excellent and even better if you shave wet in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been meaning to replace this set for probably 6 months- and wish I had because after a year and a half, this replacement proved to me how dull the blades had become in my last replacement.  I&#x27;ll make a point to replace the set right at about the 12 month mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this and don&#x27;t have the shaver itself yet, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy one here.  My first one was damaged and so I bought a replacement.  I&#x27;d buy a third one if and when something goes wrong with the one I have, now running 3+ years of daily use.</li>
    <li> So easy to replace. Great time for delivery.</li>
    <li> item is as described, it&#x27;s quality made, so far it&#x27;s holding fine and looks like it will last for some time.</li>
    <li> I needed this replacement 2 years after I purchased the shaver in Amazon as well. OEM part works the best.</li>
    <li> Brings a &#x27;like brand new&#x27; shave back to your Panasonic. All electric shaver blades &amp; foils need replacement sooner or later - a year, 18 months, 2 years...depends on how (and how often) you shave, coarseness of the hairs, etc. You&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s time (or the shaver might even display a reminder) - the shaver just doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly like when it was new, you&#x27;ll feel some snagging or having to do multiple passes where it used to only need one. Replacing the blades &amp; foil fixes this right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been a lifelong Braun user, I find that my Panasonic LA93 kept the &#x27;brand new&#x27; shave feel much longer than Braun cutters/foils did. Both are great brands, but I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve given Panasonic a try.</li>
    <li> This foil and blade set will get your Panasonic razor acting like new again, but that new feeling doesn&#x27;t last very long. I have these set to Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; so they are automatically sent to me every three months. It may be my thicker beard, but I find that I have to replace the foil and blades about once every three months to maintain a good shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend buying just the blades or just the foil as I&#x27;ve found they work best when replaced as a set. Replacing them more often can get a little expensive but to me it is worth it since the cost of the higher end cartridge razor blades is still more expensive and I prefer the electric razor anyways.</li>
    <li> When I first bought the Panasonic shaver more than a year ago, I raved about how well it shaved after being a Norelco user for more than 30 years. However, I also complained that the blades did not last long - less than a year, before they were virtually useless. I ordered the replacement blades, both inner and outer, although Panasonic recommends one be changed every other year (don&#x27;t remember which). Maybe the blades sent to me are retreads or defective, but it&#x27;s not the same shaver that I raved about last year. I have yet to use it ten times and in three instances I had to bring out a razor and shaving cream to finish the job.</li>
    <li> Like buying a new razor, kinda pricey half of what I paid for entire razor</li>
    <li> Just like the original . Perfect replacement part. Every thing justs snaps together. The razor works just like new again.</li>
    <li> These new blades make my razor feel like new! I got about a year out of the last set. Usually the foil/blades start to wear noticeably after about 6 months, and need replacing after a year.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied! Arrived before I expected and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic Replacement Head and Blades work exactly like they came with the original shaver. Easy replacement at a great price.</li>
    <li> the ahaver is aecond to none. one must use the brand name acceasories with it. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Great replacement razors but expensive.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price!!!</li>
    <li> excellent for shaving close</li>
    <li> not very good no giving a clean shave ,use pre shave after shower. should send refund .</li>
    <li> Like buying a new shaver, without spending as much money.  Have had the same original pieces since I bought my Panasonic shaver six years ago, so I was way past due to replace them and man was I glad I did!</li>
    <li> Made my shaver work like new again!!!  I could really tell the difference from my old worn out blades.  Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Just like new again. Although the cost of the blades are almost half what the razor cost.</li>
    <li> Returned my razor to like new condition. I was looking at getting a new razor, but tried this first. Glad I did as the new 5 blade razors are ridiculously expensive.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Replace every year for the perfect shave!!</li>
    <li> Very good as expected !!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> HEY!! Does your 7AM shave feel and look like a &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow?&#x27;  I bought my Panasonic Wet/Dry ES-LA3 years ago and over time, my shaves weren&#x27;t quite as smooth as they used to be.  The ES-LA3 has a symbol that illuminates when it&#x27;s time to check the outer foil and inner blades.  As a Prime Member, I ordered this product and it arrived about an hour ago (on Sunday, no less).  Don&#x27;t hurry - it takes about 4 minutes to cut the foil and blades out of the &amp;#34;STEAL PROOF&amp;#34; sealed packet, but about 15 seconds to install both and begin shaving and, once again, getting that smoothy type feeling on my face.&lt;br /&gt;There are few, if any, locations nearby where I could buy these replacement items, so when in doubt - try AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about these replacement foils. They&#x27;re exactly what you get when you purchase the original shaver, and work as intended. If your shave isn&#x27;t as smooth as it used to be, grab one of these. Replaced on the foil/blades on my ES-LA93-K.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shaver and with replacement foil and blades it&#x27;s as good as new. After I shave my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> Amazon as usual provides GREAT SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic makes quality products; I&#x27;ve had a Braun and Norelco, but love this product -- especially the wet/dry use feature!</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave everyday!</li>
    <li> Like so many other reviewers using these products to refresh my razor makes it shave like new. Super easy process to change out the foil and blades even though there aren&#x27;t any instructions. This is the second replacement set.  The original and the first set lasted about a year each until the indicator light came on. Personally, I don&#x27;t find the price unreasonable. New Gillette Mach 3 Turbo blades cost about $3 apiece in the supermarket and I would easily use more than 15 blades a year.  Seems less wasteful as well. Less packaging, no shaving cream or containers and tossing blades only once a year instead of once a week.</li>
    <li> Finally replaced my blades after a couple years of use.  Easy to install with very little time.  Been using for about 3 months and they work great.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install and makes my panasonic shaver like new again. Except for battery life. But thats okay.</li>
    <li> This is the second time a Panasonic shaver I bought has lost the LED screen.  This is less then 1year old and the screen display does not work properly.  The shaver does still work.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly into my Panasonic Electric Razor.</li>
    <li> The cutter and foil bring this shaver back to like-new performance.  It is a high quality product.  I knocked off one star as it is fairly expensive.</li>
    <li> That is all that I could ask for.  Parts fit and work perfectly.  I will continue to turn to Amazon to order replacement parts for my Panasonic.</li>
    <li> expensive and for an expensive razor but  it all works. The only electric razor system and blades that will almost last me a year. Please note that I shave face AND HEAD.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and prodcuts was just as discribed. Saved money and had foil and blades in my hands faster then speed of sound. Well close...</li>
    <li> I like the replacement foil and blade set and they work like having a new shaver again. I wish that they price was not so high on these though. This brand was the cheapest of them all and they are the best also.</li>
    <li> Ideal solution to a dull razor. Easy to replace existing baldes and end up with a perfect shave again. Great product</li>
    <li> Came to me quicker than promised.  Works as expected, like a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> When this started out as a $300 shaver, I simply could not recommend it at that price (I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it, but would not have if I&#x27;d been purchasing it).  It&#x27;s since come down in price, and at current prices, I&#x27;d replace mine in a moment with another of the same model.  So when I got these replacement parts, I was immediately reminded what I liked so much about the razor itself - this replacement blade/foil combination made it a \\&quot;new\\&quot; razor all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 3rd set of blades and foil I&#x27;ve gotten for this razor.  With a heavy beard, I think a full year or more per set is quite adequate, before replacement becomes necessary.  In nearly 50 years of shaving, I&#x27;ve never had as close or comfortable a shave as I&#x27;ve had with this shaver, including after replacing previous blade/foil combinations.  As long as they make this razor and the blades/foil to go with it, I will have no need to even try out another razor - it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Replacing the foil and shaver heads makes this razor like new.  Either I&#x27;m lucky, or the foil is better than some of the other brands&#x27; foils.  I&#x27;ve put holes in other foils, but never with these.</li>
    <li> Parts work as good as the originals.</li>
    <li> Seems like a new shaver when I replace with these new parts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic for a couple of years and I&#x27;m finding that the replacement blades are only lasting a couple of months.  At $50 a pop I&#x27;m losing my interest in keeping this shaver.</li>
    <li> I probably waited too long to get this.  My razor works like new.  Much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> Fast service and just what I needed to make my razor new again!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced the blades in 2 years. When you invest in an electric razor of such high cost, the last thing you want to think about is spending $50 every year to replace blades, I could spend less and use disposable razors instead. However, replacing these blades brought back a machine that I had forgot existed. Right back to the smooth sailing I had out of the box. Definitely worth the investment, I would suggest making sure you run the cleaning cycle more often to keep the blades in great shape since the cartridges are relatively cheap by comparison.</li>
    <li> No problem just what I needed</li>
    <li> Not my first time purchasing replacement parts&lt;br /&gt;Parts are top quality and are easy to install&lt;br /&gt;Parts last a long time, 12 months&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive parts</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever had.  Original head lasted 2 years.</li>
    <li> After a few years of semi-regular use, I thought it was time to replace the blades in my razor.  These are genuine Panasonic, and they popped right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  These parts do not attach very securely, so be careful when cleaning the razor.  If you shake it to clean it, the blades will probably fall out.</li>
    <li> I am an extremely demanding customer for a shaver, and the line of Panasonic Linear Wet/Dry Shavers are the only ones I have ever found that will give me the closeness I want - much closer than a blade shave or any of the others I have ever tried (Norelco, Braun, Remington, etc.).  That said, I replace the foil every year and the blades every two years on my current Panasonic.  What I notice when I replace both foil and blades at the same time is a dramatic reduction in the noise level that creeps up on you over time.  I also notice a reduced time to get the same closeness of shave as well as an increase in comfort and ease of shaving.  Stick with the genuine Panasonic replacement parts and you will not go wrong!</li>
    <li> Worked fine, 4th set of blades I&#x27;ve purchased for this razor.</li>
    <li> My shaver is like new again. I didn&#x27;t realize my shaver didn&#x27;t do the job it originally did. Feels like a new one.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the smoother operation of the foil and blade replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several Panasonic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes time to replace the foil and blade, I always look at the cost of the newest Panasonic. Sometimes I simply buy the newest and latest Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my shock when I discovered that the new Panasonic ESLV65 costs $535.86. Ridiculous price for an electric motor powering blades.&lt;br /&gt;$47 versus $500 plus? I should simply replace the foil and blade more often.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for this product, you already have the electric shaver.  So there&#x27;s no point in me describing the shaver.  The blades are nice and sharp and made the shaver like new.  Unlike some other replacement blades I&#x27;ve gotten for various shavers over the years, these seemed to be exactly like the ones that came with the shaver.  So you&#x27;re going to get the shave you expect, no problems.</li>
    <li> After fitting the new blades and foil the shaver is like new and highly recommended. The shave is now as close as it was when the shaver was first bought.</li>
    <li> Ahhh! My trusty Panasonic ES LA63 electric shaver is just like new again, thanks to the new blade and foil replacement, after almost two years of use. Back to super-close and comfortable shaves. Easy to replace: pop out the old and pop in the new. After owning Norelco, Braun, and Remington, this Panasonic is just the best!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the last set.</li>
    <li> I met my expectations all the way</li>
    <li> I ordered this to send to my deployed husband and it arrived within the time it said it would.  We purchased the razor prior to his leaving but didn&#x27;t think to pick up replacement parts at the time.  He doesn&#x27;t get the normal length of use out of this product but does have to shave more often than most guys.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to replace the existing foil and blades.  I love this razor and use it daily.  Good product.</li>
    <li> After delaying replacing the blades and foil for far too long, I broke down and took the plunge. What a difference. The razor now works just as well as the day it was born! Yours will too!!</li>
    <li> Great product at great price and was able to purchase when all websites said back order</li>
    <li> After cleaning my razor and installing all this, it&#x27;s as if  brand new.  Works and fits perfect on my ES-LA93 Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Fits &amp; works perfectly.  It&#x27;s like getting a brand new razor!  Definitely recommended for owners of this razor, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> I have purchased at least 4 of these over the last several years, all with excellent, close shaves. HOWEVER, this time the set must not have been made properly, because it was as dull and slow as the set I replaced. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and unhappy with the quality of the current blades !!! Wish I had kept the old blades.</li>
    <li> Made the razor act like new again. Didn&#x27;t realize how much I was missing having not replaced it in over 2 years.</li>
    <li> these replacements blades and foil made an old shaver new again!!!  Its a good idea to replace once per year</li>
    <li> This is a good package, easy to install and saved me from buying a new Panasonic for a while.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, easy installation.</li>
    <li> Everything fit well. The shave quality improvrd</li>
    <li> These are a direct replacement for the older original, and improved the smoothness and quality of shaving.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my ES-LA63.  Turned my electric razor back into a new machine.  I was a little hesitant to buy this because the ad said it was for an ES-LA63S and ES-LA63K.  However it worked fine with my ES-LA63 so I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic replacement foil and blades shave close, smooth, and fast.  This difference is noticed immediately.  Recommend replacing both foil and blades once a year.  Over time, the foil screen will eventually wear thin and create a larger opening that will act as a blade itself and possibly allow the inner blades to make contact with the skin.  I have found this to be true of foil shavers.  With the new replacement foil and blade, the shaving experience is close as a good manual razor, more economical to use, and safe to the face.</li>
    <li> My shaver is awesome. The new blades really make a difference.</li>
    <li> right product and on time delivery</li>
    <li> Good replacement but pricy. Almost bought a new shaver but end up just buying the replacement blade.</li>
    <li> The One and Only, Excellent OEM Consumable. No Generic Alternative. Quite Expensive.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old blade and cover with new ones. In truth there is not much difference from the old which were over a year old.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to install. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> What a difference a new razor makes! Great service and super fast!! Happy!!</li>
    <li> Replaced the foil and blades on my Panasonic ES-la93 wet/dry shaver and now it operates as if it was brand new. My Panasonic now cuts closer and is much quieter.</li>
    <li> Easy install and great product.</li>
    <li> My husband says it works great! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This set of Panasonic outer foil/inner blade is what the Dr. ordered for my ailing Panasonic shaver.  My shaver now works like new.  I can really feel the difference.</li>
    <li> This is well worth your money. It has brought back my shaver&#x27;s performance to a &#x27;good as new&#x27; condition and I stopped getting ingrown hairs and bumps once again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend getting the foil or the cutter by themselves. I did before and performance was subpar - get this set and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good as new performance&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect fit on the shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Price: it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> Happy b/d to me, happy b/d to me.</li>
    <li> oem replacement, makes the shaver return to its original effectiveness, just a little pricey. will probably buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Just after 25 days foil breakes. Foil &amp; blade which came with shaver worked for 2yrs and this one breakes so soon.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if i can return it now.</li>
    <li> While I feel this is overpriced by Panasonic, I must admit that their electric shavers are superior to those of Braun and Norelco, both of which I have used in the past.  The new foil and blade set makes the shaver feel like new again.</li>
    <li> Awfully expensive but they keep a good shaver in working condition.  My husband likes the shaver a lot.  We seem to need new blades a bit more often than with the Braun he had previously, but he does like the shaver better.  Cleans easily under water too- no expensive cleaning modules needed.</li>
    <li> One of the best things in my life.</li>
    <li> OEM replacement for my Panasonic razor. Works as expected, wish it were cheaper!</li>
    <li> This is the replacement blade I use for my ES-LA93-K shaver (black). I have been changing out my blades and the foil once every six months, but I have to say these blades and the foil last longer than that. As long as you maintain them with the same care you would a straight razor these will last you a while.</li>
    <li> I got this 1.5 years after I bought the razor. I started to notice that the foil was cutting me more and the shave wasn&#x27;t as good as it use to be. After swapping out the foil/blades the shave it like it use to be. Its not cheap but cheaper than a new razor. Lets hope the battery last :)</li>
    <li> Waited 14 months before replacing both the blades and foil.&lt;br /&gt;Works like a new razor. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Could not have been better.</li>
    <li> Second time buying these replacements. Very easy to install and keeps my razor going strong 3plus years later. Sure I could probably buy a new razor for the price of the replacement blades combined. But I like my panasonic and am willing to pay for the replacements which last at least a year depending on how much you shave.</li>
    <li> As good as the original parts. I just wish they weren&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other commenters saying that replacing blades and foil at the same is best.  I also find that, with a heavy beard, I start noticing degraded performance around the 8 month mark (takes 1-2 minutes longer to get a satisfactory shave).  By the tenth month, odd buzzing sounds start coming from what I conclude are the blades interfering with widening, deforming holes in the foil.  It still cuts acceptably at that point, so I push them to an even year before replacing. (Amazon, why not 12-month renewal option?)  For those complaining about price, it is much cheaper than buying quality razor blades, and is worth it (unlike the cost of buying carts for the unreliable cleaning machine.  Stick with the faucet and soap).</li>
    <li> Great way to renew your electric razor. Makes my razor work like new each time I replace the blades. Kind of expensive but worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor from Panasonic esla93k almost 3 years ago and is still working well thanks to the replacement parts I ordered here. The razor is like brand new and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> razor feels like new great buy</li>
    <li> Replacing the foil and blades on my Panasonic electric razor return the shaving experience to like new performance! I replace the foil annually and the blades bi-annually. Both the foil and blades will last longer than annually and bi-annually however the improved shaving experience is worth the additional cost to me!</li>
    <li> Having had my ES-LA93-K for nearing two years now, the blades had dulled and the foil had... whatever happens to foils I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering this revived my shaver and made the finish as smooth as it was the day I bought it, and at a lower price than buying the two parts individually previously was!</li>
    <li> My hubby love the panasonic shaver that I bought him for christmas and when the foil and blade started to dull I bought this and it is great!</li>
    <li> Expensive, but have to have it....annoying, but it works.</li>
