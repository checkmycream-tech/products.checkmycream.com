### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Looks great for both!</li>
      <li>Great price!!</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of using liquid foundation - and this is the perfect solution!</li>
      <li>but for everything under &amp;#34;Doug&amp;#34; size this powder works great.</li>
      <li>The powder foundation works great for oily skin.</li>
      <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>Love this product, perfect color and description</li>
      <li>Never looks chalky, never cakes, also a nice finish!  </li>
      <li>Nice as always!</li>
      <li>The ivory color blends well with my fair redhead complexion.</li>
      <li>It was a good deal.</li>
      <li>good seller all is good</li>
      <li>Perfect for light coverage, doesn&#x27;t cake on.  </li>
      <li>In the heat and humidity, unless you are going to be in A/C and touching up all day, this is great.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this powder!</li>
      <li>The prices are so much better than the stores!  </li>
      <li>LOVE it!</li>
      <li>This is a nice powder foundation.  </li>
      <li>The sponge that comes with it is really nice, and easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>I got a great price for these 2, My daughter love this powder and this was super cheap.</li>
      <li>This is by no means my favorite powder foundation</li>
      <li>I love CG products -- they don&#x27;t make my skin break out, aren&#x27;t oily or caked.</li>
      <li>Better than all of the NARS, Lauder and Clinique powders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite foundation.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and haven&#x27;t found anything else that compares.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically a pressed powder that&#x27;s a bit fuller in coverage than most, so it can replace foundation, though it also works fine over a liquid or cream foundation/</li>
      <li>The color was what I expected, and the price I got was excellent!</li>
      <li>I had never ordered make-up of any kind from Amazon before but the price was right</li>
      <li>If I have a &amp;#34;Doug-like&amp;#34; (see the episode of Family Guy where Chris has a huge, mutant zit he names Doug)</li>
      <li>I enjoy this, it was given to me as a gift from my aunt</li>
      <li>It is light and airy.  </li>
      <li>I use a light moisturizer on my face before applying, and once it dries, then I apply the powder.</li>
      <li>Well, I got it here cheaper with free shipping.</li>
      <li>Shade came in darker than I ordered and I ordered the lightest option available.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth with no clumping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However it&#x27;s too orange to be considered ivory, so it may not be the best purchase for someone as pale as myself.</li>
      <li>Nice powder not thick</li>
      <li>item arrived on time, packed appropriately and is the exact thing I ordered.</li>
      <li>Perfect product if you want to go natural for the day or can put on over regular make-up routine.</li>
      <li>I like this powder because it works perfectly with my pasty skin tone and dark hair and offers good, consistent coverage without making me feel like I have too much stuff on my face.</li>
      <li>Perfect for hot summer days when I need foundation for coverage but don&#x27;t want to wear a heavy liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>For about 10 years I have continued to use CG Simply Powder in Ivory, because it works as advertised and always looks good.</li>
      <li>I have heard good things about this powder but instead of two, I only received one.  </li>
      <li>I would advice against ordering this item unless you think the price is good for only one compact.</li>
      <li>and I keep one in my purse for quick touchups or emergency blemish coverage.</li>
      <li>I live in a tropical-ish climate and I have oily skin, so this works better than anything else I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Would give five stars for quality, because it gives excellent, long lasting coverage and was a steal for the price at which I purchased the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looks fantastic and treats my skin VERY well.  </li>
      <li>It covers perfectly but obviously too dark.</li>
      <li>(she has more money then a 20 something who just opened a business that demands time and money, movies are expensive to make LOL)</li>
      <li>The consistency is pretty good, but my face does look a slight bit cakey after applying.</li>
      <li>I only received one compact and haven&#x27;t been able to contact seller.</li>
      <li>controls shine very well, never oxidizes or changes color on my very oily skin, and comes with a washable foam sponge applicator.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s real foundation coverage.</li>
      <li>I love CoverGirl products, but I also love some other major and minor brands</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite everyday foundations.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It covers better than a plain powder.  </li>
      <li>Although I usually use the 2nd or 3rd lightest warm/yellow-toned foundation in most brands (classic ivory, nude, buff, etc), I use the lightest available shade (Ivory) in this powder.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the exact same product I always use to buy.</li>
      <li>I am very freckled, and after I apply it, you can&#x27;t tell I have a single freckle or a ruddy complexion.</li>
      <li>This actually covers completely.</li>
      <li>I tried the Classic Ivory and it was too dark.</li>

<li> Although I usually use the 2nd or 3rd lightest warm/yellow-toned foundation in most brands (classic ivory, nude, buff, etc), I use the lightest available shade (Ivory) in this powder.</li>

<li> This actually covers completely.</li>
<li> I tried the Classic Ivory and it was too dark.</li>
<li> These compacts do seem like they last a really long time though</li>
<li> The only problem that I have it that it eventually seems to loose the powder quality and the last 1/3 gets caked</li>
<li> /&gt;It adds a touch of color to my face, covers up some minor redness and age spots, and removes the oily shine.&lt;br</li>
<li> , I just pat a small amount of extra powder on the blemish areas after I have applied an even coat of powder to my entire face and this takes care of the extreme vast majority of blemishes.</li>
<li> My experience with this type of issue in the past is that customer service will act like they don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re talking about if you simply ask them to send the missing item, so I felt that my only option was to return it.  </li>
<li> about every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> i&#x27;d like the other sent to me as well</li>
<li> The lightest shade is still just a bit too dark for my skintone</li>
<li> I can even cry with it on, and tears will run down my cheeks without removing the color and leaving streaks.</li>
<li> This is a terrifble product due to the hardening of it after a few uses.</li>
<li> This is the only powder I have used for years and if Cover Girl ever stops making it I will stop wearing make-up and develop a serious attitude.</li>
<li> The sweat will make little beads, but the color won&#x27;t come off.</li>
<li> It even skin tone without looking too heavy.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a top powder.</li>
<li> This foundation replaced my usual Clinique foundation.</li>
<li> like how well it covers everything, and although it is heavy for a powder it isn&#x27;t heavy as a foundation itself, oil bases are worse.</li>
<li> I have a horrible habit of dropping things (clumsy) - the powder has stayed together and not broken loose!</li>
<li> I will probably opt for something that gives a lighter coverage in the future as I hate the feeling of makeup on my face.</li>
<li> Arrived broken, had to return it.</li>
<li> Very frustrating, I have had this on a subscription order and haven&#x27;t hada  problem before.</li>

    <li> I love CoverGirl products, but I also love some other major and minor brands so I&#x27;m not being brand bias. I enjoy this, it was given to me as a gift from my aunt (she has more money then a 20 something who just opened a business that demands time and money, movies are expensive to make LOL) and I get it each time she comes to visit, about every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how well it covers everything, and although it is heavy for a powder it isn&#x27;t heavy as a foundation itself, oil bases are worse.</li>
    <li> I did not receive two, as ordered.  However, I was charged for two.  I would like to receive what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Nice powder not thick</li>
    <li> Perfect for light coverage, doesn&#x27;t cake on.  The color matches my skin tone. No orangey color. The powder foundation works great for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have heard good things about this powder but instead of two, I only received one.  My experience with this type of issue in the past is that customer service will act like they don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re talking about if you simply ask them to send the missing item, so I felt that my only option was to return it.  I would advice against ordering this item unless you think the price is good for only one compact.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this powder! It has always been my go - to choice of makeups. I am not a fan of using liquid foundation - and this is the perfect solution! I use a light moisturizer on my face before applying, and once it dries, then I apply the powder. It looks fantastic and treats my skin VERY well.  I will be a life-long customer!</li>
    <li> Arrived broken, had to return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this exclusively for about 8 years now. It&#x27;s the only makeup I can&#x27;t sweat off. I was born with a sweaty nose and upper lip. The sweat will make little beads, but the color won&#x27;t come off. I can even cry with it on, and tears will run down my cheeks without removing the color and leaving streaks. I could never say that about liquid foundation or cream-to-powder. This actually covers completely. It&#x27;s not a top powder. It&#x27;s real foundation coverage. I am very freckled, and after I apply it, you can&#x27;t tell I have a single freckle or a ruddy complexion. It lasts about 25-30 days for me with use on a daily basis. I sometimes switch up a shade in the summer time if I&#x27;m getting a lot of sun.</li>
    <li> Love this product, perfect color and description</li>
    <li> I also received only 1, when the description said, &amp;#34;pack of 2&amp;#34;. i&#x27;d like the other sent to me as well</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite everyday foundations.  It is light and airy.  Perfect for hot summer days when I need foundation for coverage but don&#x27;t want to wear a heavy liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Would give five stars for quality, because it gives excellent, long lasting coverage and was a steal for the price at which I purchased the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it&#x27;s too orange to be considered ivory, so it may not be the best purchase for someone as pale as myself.</li>
    <li> I only received one compact and haven&#x27;t been able to contact seller. Very frustrating, I have had this on a subscription order and haven&#x27;t hada  problem before. Just want the second compact as advertised and that I paid for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did before I bought make-up on Amazon.  The prices are so much better than the stores!  This powder services its purpose for powder.  I don&#x27;t consider it foundation at all.  I actually use it over my regular foundation to set it.  The only problem that I have it that it eventually seems to loose the powder quality and the last 1/3 gets caked and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I have used the 505 shade for years and about a year ago I started noticing it wasn&#x27;t ever in stock at 3 separate stores. Well, I got it here cheaper with free shipping. It&#x27;s the exact same product I always use to buy. Got the order in like 2 days. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I got a great price for these 2, My daughter love this powder and this was super cheap.</li>
    <li> This is a nice powder foundation.  It even skin tone without looking too heavy. The ivory color blends well with my fair redhead complexion.</li>
    <li> I like that you get two in a pack.  It was a good deal.</li>
    <li> This is by no means my favorite powder foundation but it&#x27;s not too shabby for the price. The lightest shade is still just a bit too dark for my skintone so I probably won&#x27;t repurchase. The consistency is pretty good, but my face does look a slight bit cakey after applying. I will probably opt for something that gives a lighter coverage in the future as I hate the feeling of makeup on my face. These compacts do seem like they last a really long time though and I keep one in my purse for quick touchups or emergency blemish coverage.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! I have a horrible habit of dropping things (clumsy) - the powder has stayed together and not broken loose! The color was what I expected, and the price I got was excellent!</li>
    <li> This did not come as a 2 pack it came as a one pack and then I had to contact Amazon to fix the issue.</li>
    <li> Nice as always! Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Shade came in darker than I ordered and I ordered the lightest option available. It covers perfectly but obviously too dark.</li>
    <li> Product was just as described.  Great price!!</li>
    <li> I live in a tropical-ish climate and I have oily skin, so this works better than anything else I have ever used.  In the heat and humidity, unless you are going to be in A/C and touching up all day, this is great.  You can do touch ups and increase the coverage as you like.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation.  I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and haven&#x27;t found anything else that compares.&lt;br /&gt;It adds a touch of color to my face, covers up some minor redness and age spots, and removes the oily shine.&lt;br /&gt;It covers better than a plain powder.  The sponge that comes with it is really nice, and easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> For about 10 years I have continued to use CG Simply Powder in Ivory, because it works as advertised and always looks good. It&#x27;s basically a pressed powder that&#x27;s a bit fuller in coverage than most, so it can replace foundation, though it also works fine over a liquid or cream foundation/concealer.&lt;br /&gt;It controls shine very well, never oxidizes or changes color on my very oily skin, and comes with a washable foam sponge applicator. Better than all of the NARS, Lauder and Clinique powders I&#x27;ve tried. Btw the shades run somewhat darker than you&#x27;d expect. Although I usually use the 2nd or 3rd lightest warm/yellow-toned foundation in most brands (classic ivory, nude, buff, etc), I use the lightest available shade (Ivory) in this powder. I tried the Classic Ivory and it was too dark.</li>
    <li> This is a terrifble product due to the hardening of it after a few uses. I actually cancelled this subscription over the phone and I still get the product delivered and charged to my credit card!! I have several boxes of these that will end up in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Must have!! This comes with 2 of the same item! For the price I would pay for 1 in store! I love CG products -- they don&#x27;t make my skin break out, aren&#x27;t oily or caked. Have tried more expensive make up products and they all react with my skin. CG does not. Perfect product if you want to go natural for the day or can put on over regular make-up routine. Looks great for both!</li>
    <li> good seller all is good</li>
    <li> My go to shade. This foundation replaced my usual Clinique foundation. It goes on smooth with no clumping. It keeps me from being too oily.</li>
    <li> I had never ordered make-up of any kind from Amazon before but the price was right so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My item arrived on time, packed appropriately and is the exact thing I ordered. I like this powder because it works perfectly with my pasty skin tone and dark hair and offers good, consistent coverage without making me feel like I have too much stuff on my face. I find I don&#x27;t have to use additional concealer for blemishes, I just pat a small amount of extra powder on the blemish areas after I have applied an even coat of powder to my entire face and this takes care of the extreme vast majority of blemishes. If I have a &amp;#34;Doug-like&amp;#34; (see the episode of Family Guy where Chris has a huge, mutant zit he names Doug) zit I figure I&#x27;m just gonna have to wait it out as there is nothing in the world that will cover such a thing except a ski mask, but for everything under &amp;#34;Doug&amp;#34; size this powder works great. This is the only powder I have used for years and if Cover Girl ever stops making it I will stop wearing make-up and develop a serious attitude.</li>
    <li> Never looks chalky, never cakes, also a nice finish!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years!  The only I would ever buy!</li>
