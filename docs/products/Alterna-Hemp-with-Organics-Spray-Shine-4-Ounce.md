      <li>This time the 2 bottles were not only packaged a tad different from the old ones, but they did not seem to give me the ungreasy shine that I used to get.</li>

    <li> This spray smells fantastic - like oranges - and helps tame flyaways on my long, wavy hair.  It doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of hold, but what I do is spray on my favorite hairspray for hold, then mist on this spray shine to add more luster and to make my hair smell good.</li>
    <li> Three girls in the family and this is used almost daily.  If you have dry hair or heat damage from a hair dryer, this is a must.</li>
    <li> I have straight hairs and I have been using this product (together with the shampoo and conditioner from the same line) for years. I have shiny hair and I think this product helps making them shiny. Smells great and feels light. I don&#x27;t color or treat my hair with any chemicals so that probably helps too...</li>
    <li> Does not wear your hair down and I love the smell :-)&lt;br /&gt;Get a lot of compliments on it once i spray my hair :-)&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> Has changed? It seems like a different smell, and has more alcohol than before. I don&#x27;t like the new changes. Unit used to smell better. It dries out the hair now.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for shine all day on your hair m.</li>
    <li> I have been using this particular product for many years now and love it.  This time the 2 bottles were not only packaged a tad different from the old ones, but they did not seem to give me the ungreasy shine that I used to get. Not sure if they changed to formula or not but they should have left it alone, it worked great before. It still gives me a little shine and smells wonderful and I&#x27;m still going to use it.  I still like it, just don&#x27;t Love it like I used to.</li>
    <li> I miss the old one with the orange scent. (In the metal bottle.) Still works though.</li>
    <li> I received the product much earlier than the promised date and am very pleased with it.  Just a few sprays and my hair shines as if it were illuminated by sunshine.  It does not offer much hold but leaves the hair soft and flexible.</li>
    <li> I love this product and am sorry to see it discontinued. I&#x27;m glad I had a chance to buy a few.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  Smells so fresh and really makes my hair look shiny and healthy!  The new formulation is now in a pump spray and smells a little different.  Haven&#x27;t started using it yet so don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll like it as well as the aerosole spray kind.</li>
    <li> I Love the shine!  A little spritz goes a long way and lasts and lasts.  This is on my list of favorites!</li>
    <li> Shiny beautiful hair you&#x27;ll have. Smells like oranges.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is suppose to do for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is shiny and soft after use.&lt;br /&gt;One of the better shine products for your hair,.</li>
    <li> An excellent product for your hair helps to save the tint coloring and makes&lt;br /&gt;it shinny and bright.  The company that I ordered from was fast and with&lt;br /&gt;no problems.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product as what I am used to.  It didn&#x27;t smell the same and was sticky like hairspray.</li>
    <li> This is a very light spray that produces a fantastic shine and smells great.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair fairly shiny with added softness but the picture shown is the discontinued product that I loved and I received the new replacement product that smells more medicinal and not as light on hair.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute, hands-down favorite shine spray.  Smells fantastic (fresh/clean/orange/citrusy) and has such a light spray mist that it won&#x27;t make hair look greasy (like others tend to do).  I have tried many many shine sprays (expensive ones and drug store ones) and this is the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have fine, slightly wavy blonde hair.  I use this after straightening and even a spritz or two after I curl it and it won&#x27;t take the curl out because it is so light!</li>
    <li> THIS IS ALSO SOME GREAT STUFF, AND I HAVE TRIED A FEW OF THE SPRAY SHINE PRODUCTS OUT THERE AND THIS ONE IS TOP ON MY FAV LIST. THE SMELL IS &#x27;WONDERFUL&#x27;, LIKE YOU WERE OUT SOMEWHERE TROPICAL FOR THE DAY. IT IS SIMPLY A UNIQUE SCENT VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE BLAH OTHERS.....AND GIVES YOUR HAIR GREAT SHINE WITH A UNIQUE FEEL TO IT. SOME PRETTY GREAT STUFF I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Definitely leaves your hair feeling silky and shiny! I use it on both on wet/dry hair! Nice light fragrance too!</li>
