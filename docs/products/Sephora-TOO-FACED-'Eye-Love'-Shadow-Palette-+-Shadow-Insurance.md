      <li>The 8 shades give you a wide variety of eye looks you can create but their pairings work the best.</li>

      <li>Great little compact with an assortment of colors that would look good on any</li>

      <li>They go on clean, smooth, and with the shadow insurance (and or eye primer)</li>
      <li>I was so excited about this palette, but now that I have used it, I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I love the quality of this eyeshadow palette the pigments are wonderful and long lasting will definitely buy more!!</li>

      <li>No doubt this palette is popular with young girls, but I like it too.  </li>
      <li>I love having so many different looks to choose from!</li>
      <li>Passed it off to my daughter, she liked it a little more than I did.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday looks.</li>
      <li>Very nice it stays on and isn&#x27;t heavy.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I ordered an extra.</li>
      <li>This Palette is so pretty.</li>
      <li>So pretty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought just about every kind of brand of eyeshadow but too faced is one of my favorites highly pigmented easy to apply long lasting finish and</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use the shimmery ones since I am a more matte flat color girl.</li>
      <li>but you really have to get a lot of the color for it to show also one of the seams inside the palette was coming off</li>
      <li>this product was.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for some time now,but the colours come off very faded and you need to apply a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thanks again.  </li>
      <li>Love the palette itself but when I received it the pink was shattered.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I love that some shades have a slight shimmer for standing out.</li>
      <li>I think the colors are very pretty for younger people.</li>
      <li>I love how it comes with the little postcard that shows each look and how to master it.</li>
      <li>Faced&#x27;s normal standards.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very critical of eyeshadows as I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>They do last for 4 hours, but if you tend to sweat a lot like I do even with using the eye primer it doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
      <li>The shadows just seemed a bit old.</li>
      <li>So far, I use this almost every day.  </li>
      <li>The small tube of eyelid primer will last a very long time and it is nice to have that included with the set.</li>
      <li>I have tons of options as there is different light and dark colors which leaves me open to also mix.</li>
      <li>The shadows are also really small, so in my opinion, this palette just isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>

    <li> BOO. i dont know if this palette was a dupe or not but do not get this palette. pigments are not that well.</li>
    <li> Love this TOO Faced eye shadow palette...the price is excellent</li>
    <li> These eyeshadows are just amazing- and any color combination works. There is not one eyeshadow that I&#x27;m disappointed in. Not one. They are all beautifully pigmented and they last all day over my Too Faced eyeshadow insurance primer. This is probably my favorite palette. I&#x27;m very critical of eyeshadows as I have very oily skin. This is the best palette I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>

    <li> This is probably my favorite shadow palette, and I own a LOT of different ones/high dollar brands, but for whatever reason this looks SO good on your skin! This is generously priced.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my twenty something daughter. I think the colors are very pretty for younger people. It has some shimmer and shine to the colors. I would buy it again. The small tube of eyelid primer will last a very long time and it is nice to have that included with the set.</li>

    <li> Great for everyday looks. So pretty. Goes on beautifully and blends perfect..  They give you ideas for how to apply which is great for a beginner.  I think this would be absolutely perfect for a teens first palette. As there is nothing too heavy or shocking in this palette.</li>

    <li> This is a great pallet and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought just about every kind of brand of eyeshadow but too faced is one of my favorites highly pigmented easy to apply long lasting finish and the primer is one of my faves! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just purchased the original too faced romantic eye palette and decided to write this review because i realised exactly how bad this product was.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for some time now,but the colours come off very faded and you need to apply a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the product is fake or not,but the eyeshadows are dry and the pigmentation is terrible compared to the original i just bought.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the price. The primer that comes with it is tiny but it&#x27;s nice to try it out before buying the full size. I have noticed my eye makeup stays longer with the primer. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice colors! the browns are really pretty for an everyday look! i use it all the time! deff recommend</li>
    <li> Great little compact with an assortment of colors that would look good on any complexion.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is really cute and functional.</li>
    <li> Sorry it took awhile for the review but I can honestly say I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I love the shadow insurance and the color coordination. My favorite is he SATIN SHEETS with LIKE A VIRGIN. I love how it comes with the little postcard that shows each look and how to master it. I find myself using this more then my other shadows. I love two faced products EVEN MORE NOW since I bought this :)</li>
    <li> Love the palette itself but when I received it the pink was shattered. More bubble wrap is a good idea.</li>
    <li> love the colors in the palette but you really have to get a lot of the color for it to show also one of the seams inside the palette was coming off</li>
    <li> I absoulty love the colors. I don&#x27;t really use the shimmery ones since I am a more matte flat color girl. They do last for 4 hours, but if you tend to sweat a lot like I do even with using the eye primer it doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this eye shadow palette. I like all of the colors and with this pallett I am able to do my eyes anyway I want. I have tons of options as there is different light and dark colors which leaves me open to also mix. It wears well, qualit is nice and the colors are beautiful. I would purchase again. I am very happy with this product and it definately exceeds my expetations. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This Palette is so pretty. The 8 shades give you a wide variety of eye looks you can create but their pairings work the best. Their pairings are so perfectly contrasted for pop of color and blending. They work for any season and/or event. They go on clean, smooth, and with the shadow insurance (and or eye primer) they stay on all day long! Whenever I wear Too Faced eyeshadows I always get compliments. I love that some shades have a slight shimmer for standing out. I know everyone swears by Urban Decay, but I only use Too Faced and Stila. Beautiful colors, beautiful eyes. I have normal-medium color skin and they all show up perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye shadow my daughters and I use.  Very nice it stays on and isn&#x27;t heavy.  Love ALL Too Faced products.</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette arrived as shown, true to the photo. This is an awesome deal for the price.I am happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this item!!!!  Great primer that prevents creasing and provides long lasting coverage of awesome shadow combination.</li>
    <li> The eye shadows were the correct colors and looked great. The shadows just seemed a bit old. You had to scratch them for anycolor to come on the brush. Not like Too Faced&#x27;s usual products.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this palette, but now that I have used it, I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the set ended up being the shadow insurance primer. It is amazing, but wasn&#x27;t my reason for purchasing the set. I wanted an eye palette that I could carry every day that featured different looks. Only a couple of the shadows are OK, the others are poorly pigmented and aren&#x27;t velvety in texture like other Too Faced shadows I have tried. They are hard to apply &amp; there is absolutely no color payoff. I so wanted to love this set, but it just didn&#x27;t meet Too Faced&#x27;s normal standards.The shadows are also really small, so in my opinion, this palette just isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome colors love love love this!!! Every woman needs these colors. Goes on easy and smooth and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Just perfect thank you so much for shipping in France</li>
    <li> Awesome! Luv luv Too Faced products!</li>
