      <li>I like how it sort of sets up my eyeshadow and makes it pop a bit more.</li>

      <li>I like this product very much, goes on smooth, lasts all day and the price is great.</li>
      <li>This is great for my sensitive eyes!</li>
      <li>Eyeshadow stays put, but comes off easily at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply and made the powder adhere well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not a lot of product is needed, it lasts all day, and removes easily with makeup remover.</li>
      <li>So cheap and such good quality!</li>
      <li>The primer has a doe-foot applicator and a smooth consistency, which makes it easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I put a couple light dabs on each eye and rub it in with my finger.&lt;br</li>
      <li>way better than i expected and my eyeshadow color looked more bright and stayed on longer.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
      <li>I enjoyed this product very much</li>
      <li>though and is definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a great coverage and stay long</li>
      <li>Still in original packaging.</li>
      <li>This is my first primer I&#x27;ve tried and I love it.</li>
      <li>My eyeshadow might be a bit more dull than when I first apply it, but I haven&#x27;t been paying attention to that, just the creasing, and in that regard, I&#x27;ve been perfectly satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It wipes off pretty easily, I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Oil Cleanser to take my makeup off and it wipes off clean.</li>
      <li>I have very senstive skin and it works fine for a cheap primer with some color.</li>
      <li>Love it and definitely recommend &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I love the soft application brush and it goes on so smooth.</li>
      <li>Tube gets used up really quickly though</li>
      <li>The major part was getting my eyeshadow to stop creasing, which it did, but the smell might bother you if you know you&#x27;re picky about that kind of stuff, so just warning you.</li>
      <li>This is a great idea for those who have deepset eyes (like mine) and have trouble getting my eye shadow to show up.  </li>
      <li>This instantly mattifies my lids making shadow go on more smoothly</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used higher end brands and this brand</li>
      <li>so it does smudge and crease a bit throughout the day especially if it&#x27;s hot, but overall this product gives you a bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
      <li>It obviously shouldn&#x27;t be a problem since most people would apply eye shadow on it</li>
      <li>I put this stuff on first and the eyeshadow didn&#x27;t crease.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using/purchasing a primer.</li>
      <li>Definitely does the job and keeps my eye shadow crease free!</li>
      <li>Was very excited to use this eye primer, but FRESH OUT OF THE PACKAGE the tube was practically empty.</li>
      <li>a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes off kind of a sheer white when you first apply it, but once it is rubbed in you can&#x27;t see any color anymore.</li>
      <li>This primer may fall short next to the higher end Urban Decay brand, but for the most part it still gets the job done if not even better.</li>
      <li>I have had bad reactions to so many eye things, but so far this is doing me pretty good!</li>
      <li>I am very dissatisfied with the product, and believe me, I wanted it to work.</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>Texture is not so much as creamy(oily)</li>
      <li>It really helped bring out the eye-shadow color.</li>
      <li>This primer works really well.</li>
      <li>and it works very well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I needed it as much as I did, but decided to try it out.</li>
      <li>I really like this primer.</li>
      <li>Arrived broken but works pretty good</li>
      <li>My expectations weren&#x27;t very high for the price, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>My general eyeball area is pretty sensitive.</li>
      <li>looks nice on and gives you a nice base color.</li>
      <li>This year I&#x27;ve only had to touch-up once, and it was rainy and VERY humid that day!</li>
      <li>There was enough product to apply only once, and it did not dry smoothly.</li>
      <li>However the color is a little to light for my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this all the time!! It fits my skin color and my eyeshadow lasts longer!</li>
    <li> Great product,works great:-)</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the price...by the end of my 10 hr shift, wearing eyeshadow approximately 14hrs a day, I had no creases in my eye makeup.  It goes on in the color of the primer, but doesn&#x27;t change the color of the eyeshadow you are applying.  Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is great for my sensitive eyes!</li>
    <li> Eye shadow stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Buy this in person so it only costs $1.</li>
    <li> So cheap and such good quality! I am happy with this buy. 😁</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. A few years ago, I was new to applying makeup and completely missed out on primer. I didn&#x27;t think I needed it as much as I did, but decided to try it out. I&#x27;m so glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts incredibly long. I will apply it over my lids and as soon as it stops being &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; I put on my eye shadow... and it lasts HOURS. Before, I&#x27;d just use eye shadow and then an hour later or two, it&#x27;d just disappear or run a bit. After using this eyelid primer, my eye shadow (typically brown) lasts for up to ten hours. I love how my eye shadow looks on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; and mine typically dries to match my complexion (I am very pale though). It obviously shouldn&#x27;t be a problem since most people would apply eye shadow on it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend looking for this somewhere else though. I got mine at Target and the Dollar Tree for only $1. It&#x27;s rather expensive on amazon! It lasts a good while though and is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I noticed my shadow has creases by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I was very excited for buying this but it was a total disappointment! Does not work, leaves stresks on eyelid and it is NOT long lasting. mAC eye primer does wonders compsred to this. I am very dissatisfied with the product, and believe me, I wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I only got like 5 uses out of it before it ran out</li>
    <li> works nicely once blended in</li>
    <li> My 9 year old daughter is on a competitive dance team.&lt;br /&gt;I use this when applying her make-up; and don&#x27;t have to worry about re-applying! Eyeshadow stays put, but comes off easily at the end of the day. Before I found this, I would have to apply and reapply throughout the day. This year I&#x27;ve only had to touch-up once, and it was rainy and VERY humid that day!</li>
    <li> Bought the 3 pack because it had great reviews , first time it worked great well the 2nd day I put it on it started to burn my skin so I washed it off but the damage was done ....nit a great product esp when it burns your skin</li>
    <li> This is my first primer I&#x27;ve tried and I love it. I have oily skin and always have a problem where towards the middle of the day my eyeshadow will start to cease and wear off, as well as eyeliner.  Since I started using this,  it doesn&#x27;t crease or wear off at all! I don&#x27;t have to worry about working or going out with eyeliner smudging or big clumpy crease from eyeshadow anymore!  Love it and definitely recommend &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye primer for a while now and it works very well. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was very excited to use this eye primer, but FRESH OUT OF THE PACKAGE the tube was practically empty. There was enough product to apply only once, and it did not dry smoothly. Also dried too quickly and did not allow me to apply pencil eyeliner. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to apply!! It was thick and it didn&#x27;t work on keeping the eyeshadow on all day</li>
    <li> This works so well! Now I never have to reapply eye makeup throughout the day - this makes it hold position and last so much longer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hannah</li>
    <li> This is the perfect purchase.  It is exactly what I have been looking for and was unable to find.  Then I looked here and VIOLA, there it was!!  I am very pleased and satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Definitely does the job and keeps my eye shadow crease free!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Still in original packaging. Came in perfect condition. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a great coverage and stay long</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way! great product!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found this primer. I bought this at Walmart for a dollar after my Urban Decay Primer Potion ran out. My expectations weren&#x27;t very high for the price, but I was pleasantly surprised. The primer has a doe-foot applicator and a smooth consistency, which makes it easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelids oily like some primers tend to do, and my eyeshadow stayed on just as good as if I had used the UD Primer Potion. Not a lot of product is needed, it lasts all day, and removes easily with makeup remover. I will continue to buy this as long as it is in stock.</li>
    <li> Way too sheer for me.</li>
    <li> Product works, but seemed used or just dried out..</li>
    <li> This primer does wonders for my greasy eyelids. Tube gets used up really quickly though</li>
    <li> Disappointing, it did not help at all. My product  smeared in like ten minutes with this.</li>
    <li> I like the product I think that it is wonderfull.</li>
    <li> I switched to this from Benefit brand&#x27;s Stay Don&#x27;t Stray primer because it cost 6 times less and it works just as well if not better! If I don&#x27;t wear primer, I have creases in my eyeshadow after only a few hours. This instantly mattifies my lids making shadow go on more smoothly and I NEVER get creases, even after wearing shadow all day.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Covers up the ugly veins!</li>
    <li> I ordered this, because I was looking for something to stop my eyeshadow from creasing without denting my wallet unnecessarily. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now, and it works for me. I put a couple light dabs on each eye and rub it in with my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheer is a couple shades lighter than my skin, but I rub it in a bit so it&#x27;s only a shade lighter. I like how it sort of sets up my eyeshadow and makes it pop a bit more. I also use a bit under my eye to lighten that up as well. After rubbing it in, I wait for it to set while I get my eye makeup out (eyeshadow, mascara, etc.), so usually only about a minute. I try to keep my eye shut, so my eyelid isn&#x27;t creasing, but cracked enough so I can see. My eyeshadow lasts all day at work without creasing and without any touch-ups. My eyeshadow might be a bit more dull than when I first apply it, but I haven&#x27;t been paying attention to that, just the creasing, and in that regard, I&#x27;ve been perfectly satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 stars, because it has a strange smell to it. You can&#x27;t smell it when it&#x27;s on your eye, but it&#x27;s something that can be improved. It&#x27;s minor to me, so I&#x27;d really give it 4.5 stars. The major part was getting my eyeshadow to stop creasing, which it did, but the smell might bother you if you know you&#x27;re picky about that kind of stuff, so just warning you. Overall, I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I got it at Target for $2. I never wear makeup except concealer and occasionally eyeliner. Eyeshadow always creases shortly after I put it on because I have oily skin and my eyelids are especially oily. I put this stuff on first and the eyeshadow didn&#x27;t crease. After 5 hours, I just had the tiniest line in the crease. It lasted a very long time with no reapplying. I took the wand and put some on and spread it with my ring finger. It has a wonderful satiny, powdery feel to it. Not oily or lotiony or anything like that. It&#x27;s very nice. I will definitely buy this again. I got it in pearl. I like it. You could even wear it without eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> It works really well. I just didn&#x27;t realize how liquidy it was. I was hoping for something more cream based. But over all I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> This primer may fall short next to the higher end Urban Decay brand, but for the most part it still gets the job done if not even better. I have naturally oily eyelid so it does smudge and crease a bit throughout the day especially if it&#x27;s hot, but overall this product gives you a bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;Such a great concealer great for hiding those red pimples, I recommend 100%. Also buy it at your local target for 1$, in amazon its really overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;Thats the only reason for 4 stars, its not for the product but for the price on amazon</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product very much</li>
    <li> Great primer, really works well. Only issue I&#x27;ve come across and I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers with the same issue: way too little product. I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times and it&#x27;s already gone.</li>
    <li> I love ELF primers. I have this eyelid primer which I use on my eyes and my lips before putting on my liner and gloss. And I also use ELF Face primer, my makeup stays on all day just perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love this primer the applicator is perfect and the directions are simple. I work in a very active and sweaty environment and my eyeshadow still stays on thru 10 hours of sweating!! I&#x27;m highly satisfied!</li>
    <li> Received in 2 days.  Not greasy and good base for eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea for those who have deepset eyes (like mine) and have trouble getting my eye shadow to show up.  It was easy to apply and made the powder adhere well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However when I put it on and waited for it to dry, I began to feel a burning sensation on my eyelids.  I didn&#x27;t see any redness, but it was uncomfortable just the same.  I am not an allergic person, but this was something that made me wonder what it is made of. The burning sensation lasted about 10 minutes, so beware of this possible reaction.</li>
    <li> It came in nearly empty.</li>
    <li> This primer works really well. I&#x27;ve used higher end brands and this brand works just as well as those.</li>
    <li> looks nice on and gives you a nice base color.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken but works pretty good</li>
    <li> Love this! It helps my eye shadow from smudging and boy do I notice the difference if I forget to put this on. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> it dries up and doesn&#x27;t keep eyeshadow on</li>
    <li> The quality is no the best</li>
    <li> My general eyeball area is pretty sensitive. I have had bad reactions to so many eye things, but so far this is doing me pretty good! I have never really used primer on my eyelids before, so my makeup has always been sweating off. I&#x27;m pretty oily, so I kind of expect this to happen, This keeps my eyeliner on as a perfect winged line. I do notice a little bit of creasing though when I wear eyeshadow. It wipes off pretty easily, I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Oil Cleanser to take my makeup off and it wipes off clean. I&#x27;m a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes off kind of a sheer white when you first apply it, but once it is rubbed in you can&#x27;t see any color anymore. I&#x27;m super pale too.</li>
    <li> Love this primer! way better than i expected and my eyeshadow color looked more bright and stayed on longer.&lt;br /&gt;will definitely buy again but maybe next time from Target..</li>
    <li> Great product, not sticky!  No more crepey eye when I apply shadow.  Will buy again, it&#x27;s perfect...</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product before the Urban Decay Primer Potion to save some money. A few years later I still keep coming back! This product is practically the same, if not better, than the UD primer. I love the soft application brush and it goes on so smooth.</li>
    <li> This is great for girls with lighter skin. Goes and smooth and blends so well.!</li>
    <li> I really like this primer. It makes my liquid eyeliner last all day! I even use it as a concealer and it works so well for that! However the color is a little to light for my skin.</li>
    <li> Never Used A Primer.  Great Results!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wears off after about 6 hours, but it works!</li>
    <li> Great lid primer that keeps shadow and liner going all day and all night. Lightweight formula that great for all skin types. I bought here bc the e.l.f. site was out of stock at the time, but it is cheaper to buy directly from them.</li>
    <li> It feels like it is water based and the consistancy is very thin and kinda wet.... I honestly cant see no difference...</li>
    <li> I have very senstive skin and it works fine for a cheap primer with some color.</li>
    <li> Its good,  but I don&#x27;t like the smell..</li>
    <li> This was my first time using/purchasing a primer. It really helped bring out the eye-shadow color. Texture is not so much as creamy(oily) but little does go a long way. If you have oily or combination , or even dry skin it won&#x27;t do any harm for it sets on to the skin perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leave a shine.</li>
    <li> finally a decent primer to lighten eye area and leave a base for shadow.&lt;br /&gt;bets my Clinque, and other high end primers!</li>
    <li> I got elf Baked blush I was confused for a second I was  expecting  a eyelid primer</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, goes on smooth, lasts all day and the price is great. I used to be able to buy it for a $1 at Target but they have stopped carrying it. This is still a good price for this product. Only downside is the very small quantity.</li>
