      <li>I could not have asked for a more perfect or exact item than I received.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t work for me, but are nice and may work for someone with more body in their hair.</li>
      <li>Very smooth lightweight</li>
      <li>So, you don&#x27;t get a dent in your head, and they hold your hair very securely.  </li>
      <li>love thise for my hair ~ was just what was explained ~ would order again when in need of more</li>
      <li>my hair holds up much better if I have the thicker end of the stick at the bottom of my bun when placed.</li>
      <li>I love these sticks.  </li>
      <li>I do tend to bump it while getting in and out of my car though, so I have to duck more than I expect to when I wear this and am traveling in my car.</li>
      <li>I love my chopstick...</li>
      <li>More comfortable in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>easy to use,had to figure out what to with my hair.</li>
      <li>These very simple plastic sticks look beautiful in.</li>
      <li>They looked just fine - just like in the pics on the site.</li>
      <li>I have seen plenty of hair chopsticks that are made out of plastic/acrylic, and they work fine.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as pictured!!</li>
      <li>These hair-sticks are really cool.  </li>
      <li>Looks cool in photoshoots.</li>
      <li>I purchased these directly through Sally&#x27;s own website about 6 months ago.</li>
      <li>Not bad.  </li>
      <li>no one wears chopsticks in their hair where I live, so I love them.</li>
      <li>These hair sticks exceeded my expectations, given the low price (shipping cost more than the product!).  </li>
      <li>They are worth the $3.99 price though if you don&#x27;t have to pay shipping.</li>
      <li>These are actually my first set of hair sticks and it took me a while to learn how to put my hair up with them and have it stay up.</li>
      <li>I would have rated them higher.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t measured, but generally this stick sticks out of the top of my bun by about 4 inches which likely would mean I need a stick about 3 inches shorter to be a perfect</li>
      <li>I look kind of ridiculous with this very tall stick sticking up over the top of my head thanks to the length of this hair stick</li>
      <li>NOT CHEAP, VERY STURDY AND GOOD</li>
      <li>The only thing is they&#x27;re really smooth and sometimes slip out if I don&#x27;t place them in my hair just right.</li>
      <li>It does not break easily like most hair sticks I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>I also love that when I take my hair down I get really nice loose bun waves from these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I found I really like the blunter end.  </li>
      <li>These are very useful and low cost.</li>
      <li>They are too long and slippery for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>They were delivered in an timely manner and brand new!</li>
      <li>But I love these ones because they FLEX slightly.  </li>
      <li>These are definitely decent pairs of sticks for the price.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have collarbone length fine hair and these sticks hold up all my hair with no hair slipping out.  </li>
      <li>Very secure hold and long lasting.</li>
      <li>a better look than always doing a pony our a messy bun.</li>
      <li>They look sleek and classy!  </li>
      <li>and I have found that these sticks hold it nicely in a nautilus bun, though they are a little bit long for my liking.</li>
      <li>do recommend purchasing these in-store to save on the shipping cost as it&#x27;s a bit high for only very light-weight hair sticks.</li>
      <li>They are a little thicker at the tip than i like, but it works just fine</li>
      <li>I received some of these as a Christmas gift from my mom many years ago, and I lost my last one a few months ago.  </li>
      <li>My hair is a complete mix of super fine through very thick strands and is slightly to moderately wavy.</li>
      <li>The black area nice, but a fan of the brown, wish they had an all black pack.</li>
      <li>Subtle, but can be use to make one look more &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;, or cultured.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>find that with these sticks (maybe for all sticks in general)</li>
      <li>They are very smooth, though they do have a seam which is not ideal.</li>
      <li>I have very thick hair, so hair bands break easily.  </li>

<li> hair is about armpit length on the sides and almost bra strap length in the back, and has some long layers which I am growing out.</li>
<li> I wish they weren&#x27;t quite so long, but I knew the length when I ordered them.</li>
<li> For my hair length+thickness these are too long for me</li>
<li> In all, these sticks are NOT worth the total price (with shipping) of almost 10 bucks.</li>
<li> Everything as expected.</li>
<li> I have long hair and these sticks have a little flex</li>
<li> I have yet to break one, but I am very careful.</li>
<li> I may file one or two of them down an inch and save the other ones for when my hair is longer and I will need a longer</li>
<li> received 2 black and 2 tortoise shell.  </li>
<li> My hair is a little over armpit length</li>

    <li> Very secure hold and long lasting. It does not break easily like most hair sticks I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> They are too long and slippery for my fine hair. They don&#x27;t work for me, but are nice and may work for someone with more body in their hair.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and fashionable. I have very thick hair, so hair bands break easily.  This product is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured!! Extremely satisfied with this product! I could not have asked for a more perfect or exact item than I received.</li>
    <li> These hair-sticks are really cool.  They look sleek and classy!  The only thing is they&#x27;re really smooth and sometimes slip out if I don&#x27;t place them in my hair just right.</li>
    <li> they are a bit slicker than traditional sticks.  My hair is quite fine, but thick, perhaps explains why they won&#x27;t stay in place like my other sticks.  I never use them</li>
    <li> I received some of these as a Christmas gift from my mom many years ago, and I lost my last one a few months ago.  I have seen plenty of hair chopsticks that are made out of plastic/acrylic, and they work fine.  But I love these ones because they FLEX slightly.  So, you don&#x27;t get a dent in your head, and they hold your hair very securely.  Like, if I put my hair up when its damp...then end of my day I go running...it still stays in.  My favorites!</li>
    <li> No clue in the description about they they are made of. My mistake. They looked just fine - just like in the pics on the site. I gave them away because they had to be wood for my use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she was really happy with the quality of the product. They were delivered in an timely manner and brand new!</li>
    <li> Very nice hair sticks. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> love thise for my hair ~ was just what was explained ~ would order again when in need of more</li>
    <li> This item has been very handy, I keep a set at work instead of a pony tail hair thingand a set in my car.give a better look than always doing a pony our a messy bun.</li>
    <li> 7.5 inch hairsticks. These very simple plastic sticks look beautiful in. I have long hair and these sticks have a little flex so they dont snap under the weight.</li>
    <li> I purchased these directly through Sally&#x27;s own website about 6 months ago. These work well, though they seem a bit flimsy and likely to break. For my hair length+thickness these are too long for me but they do what they are supposed to do. These are actually my first set of hair sticks and it took me a while to learn how to put my hair up with them and have it stay up. I now can use one instead of two to keep my hair up all day. These are very useful and low cost. Had these been a harder/denser plastic I would have rated them higher. I have yet to break one, but I am very careful. These do flex when I am putting my hair up which freaks me out but these are great! They are very smooth, though they do have a seam which is not ideal. I am looking to upgrade my hair sticks with wooden sticks which is how I came across this here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is about armpit length on the sides and almost bra strap length in the back, and has some long layers which I am growing out. My hair is a complete mix of super fine through very thick strands and is slightly to moderately wavy. If I put my hair up in a ponytail my hair circumference is approx 3 inches, though I have lost a lot of hair as a side effect of food allergies. May be a bit thinner than that currently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that with these sticks (maybe for all sticks in general) my hair holds up much better if I have the thicker end of the stick at the bottom of my bun when placed. I look kind of ridiculous with this very tall stick sticking up over the top of my head thanks to the length of this hair stick but it works and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems in my hair that I&#x27;ve noticed. I do tend to bump it while getting in and out of my car though, so I have to duck more than I expect to when I wear this and am traveling in my car. I haven&#x27;t measured, but generally this stick sticks out of the top of my bun by about 4 inches which likely would mean I need a stick about 3 inches shorter to be a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do recommend purchasing these in-store to save on the shipping cost as it&#x27;s a bit high for only very light-weight hair sticks. In all, these sticks are NOT worth the total price (with shipping) of almost 10 bucks. They are worth the $3.99 price though if you don&#x27;t have to pay shipping.</li>
    <li> I love these! Their wonderful, they have just enough flex. The black area nice, but a fan of the brown, wish they had an all black pack.</li>
    <li> These hair sticks exceeded my expectations, given the low price (shipping cost more than the product!).  They are sleek, smooth, beautifully finished. I wish they weren&#x27;t quite so long, but I knew the length when I ordered them.</li>
    <li> Not bad.  They do the job. They are a little thicker at the tip than i like, but it works just fine</li>
    <li> These are definitely decent pairs of sticks for the price. (I just wish shipping were a bit lower). My hair is a little over armpit length and I have found that these sticks hold it nicely in a nautilus bun, though they are a little bit long for my liking. I may file one or two of them down an inch and save the other ones for when my hair is longer and I will need a longer stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product. :)</li>
    <li> I love these sticks.  They slide Into my hair like butter.  Zero snag points.  Very smooth lightweight stick.&lt;br /&gt;I received 2 black and 2 tortoise shell.  I have collarbone length fine hair and these sticks hold up all my hair with no hair slipping out.  I only need one stick to bun hair.  Keep one in bathroom, one in car, one at work and one in purse.  I also love that when I take my hair down I get really nice loose bun waves from these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried the end point would be too rounded but I found I really like the blunter end.  More comfortable in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love my chopstick...its very useful and very handy to used on the go. I keep them in my purse to use o  the go</li>
    <li> My wife says that they work great and hold her hair well.</li>
    <li> easy to use,had to figure out what to with my hair. eventually it worked out. very different. no one wears chopsticks in their hair where I live, so I love them.</li>
    <li> NOT CHEAP, VERY STURDY AND GOOD FOR ANY BARETTE  YOU HAVE</li>
    <li> Looks cool in photoshoots. Subtle, but can be use to make one look more &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;, or cultured.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, too!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Everything as expected. No complaints here.</li>
