<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looks good and fit really well. It should last a long time if you take care of it. A good wig for the price but if you want something that will handle a lot of wear then you should get a higher quality wig.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for . Tangles easy doesnt fit head</li>
    <li> Amazing. I am speachless. This wig is as pictured. Its super light weight, feels like real hair and looks real too!&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton of wigs and this is the best and cheapest one Ive bought online.</li>
    <li> I just got this wig, and it is so cute! Its really soft and doesn&#x27;t have that cheap wig shine. However it did arrive pretty late (which is expected of halloween season) and it also got delivered to my neighbors house. Also it didnt have the x&amp;y sticker, and it came with bangs (which i dont really mind) and the purplw is only there for about an inch at the bottom. Other than that its really beautiful and i love it (:</li>
    <li> This wig looks better in person. It&#x27;s my first wig. It&#x27;s long, thick, and wavy (of course). When I took it out of the package, it was ready to wear. There was no crease, and it wasn&#x27;t handled roughly or anything at all. I love this wig. It&#x27;s amazing for such a low price. And it&#x27;s sooooo soft. Also, it looks real because of the natural highlights in it. I love it. I&#x27;m buying more from X &amp; Y Angel.</li>
    <li> Great deal for such a low price! And awesome color too..</li>
    <li> Love them all I am so happy with what I got</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this wig because of bad experiences with other online sellers. I was so happy to see that the wig looked EXACTLY like the picture. Not to mention it looks and feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend this wig to anyone, it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
    <li> When I got mine in the mail I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much as far as the waves went, but when I opened the package the waves were perfect! The down side is that it was really frizzy and poofy, I have since straightened it to tame it a bit and plan to either curl it or read wave it. The wig was very easy to straighten ( just use the lowest heat setting &amp; heat resistant spray). 4 stars for the frizz and many tangles. All in all its a really good wig. It&#x27;s really thick, which was not expected for such a cheap wig and it&#x27;s not too shiny to wear in public. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase. It is a great wig, especially for such a low price. It isn&#x27;t so thin you can see the hair net and the styling was beautifully done. It was perfect as soon as I pulled it out of the package. The bangs were too long but that was easily fixed. Unfortunately, the color is too light to look good on my complexion; however, if I put on a cute beanie over it it doesn&#x27;t look that bad.</li>
    <li> This was my first wig purchase and I&#x27;m in love. It&#x27;s exactly as pictured. I&#x27;m a photographer and model and have no complaints about how it looks in photo&#x27;s as well.</li>
    <li> The cap is a bit tiny but the quality is great for a $7 something wig. Its not super thick in my opinion compared to what you usually get when you spend $30+. Bangs need a little trim but that&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL WIG!!! highly recommend this wig it is super soft easy to comb and very realistic the color has a bit red tones in it which come out more in the light it&#x27;s not curly but it&#x27;s wavy like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great great great for the price</li>
    <li> This wig is a nice wig, don&#x27;t get me wrong. It&#x27;s a quality wig, when I took it out it wasn&#x27;t shiny at all and there was no synthetic smell like with other wigs (tho it was extremely frizzy). However, it is MUCH shorter than the picture shows. I&#x27;m giving it the benefit of the doubt, though, as I haven&#x27;t had a chance to give it a fabric softener treatment yet. The length may possibly be affected by the hair all being bunched up,and once I use the fabric softener and brush it out it might get longer. However, there&#x27;s no way it will get nearly as long as the picture shows, so keep that in mind. Right now it&#x27;s just at my shoulders, after I treat it I imagine it will probably go just barely past my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for people who want to minimize the frizz and tangles, google &amp;#34;wig shine tutorial&amp;#34;. I use this one by alexamadden on deviantart http://alexamadden.deviantart.com/art/Removing-the-shine-to-your-wig-353751870 (but I skip the talc step cus it makes the wig look kind of weird in my opinion) but really any of the tutorials that use fabric softener are good. For those of you with shiny wigs and a weird synthetic smell, this will work too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, even though it&#x27;s not as long as I wanted it to be, it still looks good on me so I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase but those of you that want something exactly like pictured, I&#x27;m afraid you might not get what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Came super early and looks really nice!! Its a bit more of a gingery color but its great! Super fluffy and cute ^u^</li>
    <li> its was very frizzy but luckily it was heat resistant so i could straighten it</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t as long as it is show in the picture it only goes up to my boobs and in the picture it passes to her belly.</li>
    <li> This wig is awesome! I&#x27;ve purchased over 15 cosplay wigs from Amazon, and this one is one of the thickest, fullest wigs I&#x27;ve purchased! Looks exrcaly like the picture, and it&#x27;s so full even when you bring some of it forward to the front, there is still plenty of hair left to give a full look to the back. The bangs can be side swept or kept straight across.</li>
    <li> I needed this wig to straighten for a costume, and it straightened perfectly. The color is accurate to the picture too, I want to order a new one in the future just to wear in the wavy form. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very frizzy and fluffy. Not as pictured. I tried putting hair oil in it but it didn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
    <li> The wig is OK. The color is a little reddish. It is much frizzier than shown. There is very little sheen, which I like. It doesn&#x27;t really look like the one in the pic, but it was only 8 bucks.</li>
    <li> I love it , it looks just like the picture and you can decided if you want to have side bangs or straight , I like the side personally , it&#x27;s a tiny bit shiny but that can be fixed , I think I can pull this off as my real hair 😊 I bought this wig so I can stop damaging my hair (:</li>
    <li> Came in 2 weeks after it was suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;Basically I love this wig! Buuut it&#x27;s not true to color it&#x27;s darker. The bangs are a little longer but I don&#x27;t mind. Like I said it came late. The wig wasn&#x27;t wavy like the picture it was more curly. It kept sliding off my head. But it was soft. I&#x27;m happy with my wig overall although.</li>
    <li> I loved it! It was gorgeous and couldn&#x27;t be any better! I loved it so much and there&#x27;s not much else I could say!&lt;br /&gt;Iloveitiloveitiloveit!!!!&lt;br /&gt;:33333</li>
    <li> The bangs were a little longer than expected and it was totally different from the picture but it&#x27;s extremely natural and it doesn&#x27;t shed and isnt as tangle prone as other ones I&#x27;ve gotten from other places.</li>
    <li> This wig is WAAAY to cheap. DO NOT buy this, you&#x27;ll save yourself time, and money.</li>
    <li> I was stupid enough to ignore the reviews because of the cheap prince. But this wig (Excuse my language) Is complete and utter S***!  Looks nothing like the photo,  Feels nothing more than cheap plastic,  Looks worse than a child&#x27;s wig,  Cam tangled,  When I tried to brush it, the hair fell out,  And more.  If you&#x27;re stupid enough to buy this item, you might want to get your head checked.</li>
    <li> I have to say, i didn&#x27;t expect much out of a wig that was this cheap, but Wow! I Love This Wig!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought many wigs, with this one it makes 13, and this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;looks exactly like the photos. i have nothing bad to say! it even came a week early.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money this cheap wig!</li>
    <li> Correct coloring, and I am impressed that it can be straitened. It was too shiney for 5 stars, and too thin for 4. So I give it three stars. It took me, I kid you not, 2.5 hours to straiten it. I&#x27;d suggest buying it for one time use, but not as a daily kind of wig.</li>
    <li> Wig is correct color and almost the correct length but it is REALLY frizzy right out of the bag. I am hoping with a little styling it will look more like the photo in the listing.</li>
    <li> The bangs are very long and need to be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;The hair came curly instead of wavy.&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice natural looking (dark) brown wig, shorter than expected, and was not what I wanted when I ordered this...  but the product I got was also decent.</li>
    <li> Did not come with a wig cap and the hair was very thin. I&#x27;ve ordered X&amp;Y hair a lot in the past and they&#x27;ve never been as thin as the one I got. Also didn&#x27;t fit on my head like the others did. The color was the way it looks in the picture so that&#x27;s a plus. But overall unhappy with this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig! it took 20 days  to get here, But ,when i took it out of the bag,(which was in a box).., the wig is stunning! It is so long and soft,and feels and looks just like real hair! It does tangle just a little, due to its length, but not terribly.so.  The only thing i was disappointed in, was the color.. Although, I still love it! It said it was a brown wig.. So, I was thinking it would be Light brown, by the picture.. It&#x27;s actually an auburn ,very strawberry -orangey color.... Very pretty ,but I really wanted it to be light brown. But, I am not taking off any stars, because it is SO pretty.. It is a little thin in some places ,at the bottom.. but ,I think that;s only bc it&#x27;s so long.. You  really can&#x27;t go wrong, buying this.. You&#x27;ll be happy you did!</li>
    <li> wig fell apart after one uses</li>
    <li> Tangles horribly but a good wig besides. Nice and full great color</li>
    <li> My sister asked me to order this product for her.&lt;br /&gt;She was a little disappointed in how easy the hair knotted.&lt;br /&gt;She did not wish to return the product though.</li>
    <li> I feel like (after observing other review photos) that it&#x27;s a total crap shoot what the wig you get is going to be like. Like mine is super fuzzy, and way too crimpy in the front. And the bangs are all wackadoo. While other people&#x27;s wigs appear to be smooth and have lovely bangs. I&#x27;m going to try and wash it, but eh. Whatever.</li>
    <li> I love it!, it&#x27;s very fluffy and very long, it&#x27;s fuller than the one on the picture and the color is slightly lighter, my bangs were a bit too short, but I can always do a styling with them. I love it!</li>
    <li> Probably gonna see if I can return it, the bangs are cut cruked so if i wear it how its suppose to be worn the bangs are longer on the left side then the right. its in so many tangles its not untangleable, I dont know if im the only one who had this problem, not worth the money, so many people have good comments and ive got other things from X&amp;Y Angel before, just this one wig is crap. Also theres no wig cap like it said, and it came in a bag and its summer right now so the bag it was in MELTED to part of the wig! and the outer bag was melted to the inner one. so its not even useable at all. Like i could have just worn it with a beanie and just wore it to wear it would be kinda on my head wrong but the bangs be right, but there melted plastic in my wig.....It says on the page is comes in a hard box, no it doesnt,</li>
    <li> Cute but the wig itself is very small and it feels like it would just fall off at any time no matter how I adjust it and pin it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful wig but it&#x27;s a lighter brown then the picture and not nearly as wavy</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful. But, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s an amazing buy. There&#x27;s lot&#x27;s of pros but many cons as well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very soft. It comes with adjustable straps.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful color. Very soft. Very real looking. It&#x27;s exactly the color, length, and style that I wanted. It was delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The color is no way near the color in the picture. Packaging was very bad. The wig was in an unsealed bag (the bag was inside of another white bag that was sealed) with the ends poking out, resulting in awful ends that I ended up having to cut off. It did not include a wig cap, even though the description was, and the bangs were incredibly awfully cut. The picture where I&#x27;m wearing a hat is what it looked like before I cute it or pinned back everything (you can see out badly cut the bangs were) And the other picture is it after I pinned a few parts of the bangs and styled the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, overall, the wig is great. Especially for an $8 wig.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s poofier and frizzier than the picture. Hard to manage. Color is good, hair is soft, but the frizz is uncontrollable!</li>
    <li> Very Awful hair. Very puffy, feels fake like cotton hair or something. I will be posting a picture of what I get. Very disappointed !</li>
    <li> This looks surprisingly natural and I have enjoyed it. I have worn it quite a bit. I get a lot of comments on my hair when I wear this one.</li>
    <li> Had to trim the fringe but other than that I love love love it. Feels natural. I would suggest maybe spraying some dry shampoo on it to get the shine to dull a little if yours is super shiny.</li>
    <li> This wig is soft and thick, bangs are too long but nothing a trim can&#x27;t fix. Also the wig is not brown, it is a natural looking ginger red.</li>
    <li> Very soft and synthetic. You can apply heat but very low.. well it worked for me at least try a small strip then are how it goes . Very long and wavy and looked beautiful on me. But the bangs were rather long but a trim fixed it and loved it. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I am sooo pleased with this wig!!! It is sooo beautiful. I love the waviness but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the color. It was definitely worth the $7!!</li>
    <li> Looks real in photographs.</li>
    <li> So when I got the wig in the mail it was super frizzy... Just a huge mess. When I put it on I looked like Hagrid from Harry Potter. But, when I washed it with water and let it air-dry the frizz went down and the curls soften and it looked just like the photo. So if you get this wig and it arrives in a crazy frizzy mess- just wash it and it will return to normal.&lt;br /&gt;But since I washed it, it&#x27;s really cute! Great for the price</li>
    <li> Came very late and was orange in color. The dog attacked it and I am ok with that.</li>
    <li> Fast And looked as expected</li>
    <li> The wig was not as shone. The only kinks were on the top. The wig look like a bad blowout. I&#x27;ll add a pic</li>
    <li> I loved the New Fashion Fluffy Healthy Long Curly Kanekalon full Wig.  Unlike the other wigs that I have ordered, this particular wig was just the right texture and length.  The wig wore just as pictured with the beautiful wavy tresses cascading down for a full length style.</li>
    <li> I love this wig so much! It came to me soft and pre-styled! It also goes with all of my lolita fashion outfits! I love it!!! Makes me look extra kawaii</li>
    <li> The wig is very pretty! It&#x27;s just a little darker than expected. I&#x27;m still satisfied with my purchase though.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully soft and lightly waved.  Color is a warm chestnut mid brown with slight ginger and ash highlights.  I&#x27;d call it a 6RB. A little bit shiny, but nothing some dry shampoo can&#x27;t tone down.  Tons and tons of hair - possibly too much hair for some; may need to be thinned.  Ends are a little ragged and not wave-curled like the body of the wig; may want to trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware: cap on the wig I received is TINY. I have a very small head (children&#x27;s hats, seriously) and very little hair (I&#x27;m sick), and while this wig fits me (barely, snugly), it WILL NOT FIT much of the US population.  It&#x27;s small.  Like, tweenager sized or even slightly smaller.  As these wigs are mostly handmade, obviously your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived from China in just about ten days.  Good value for a very budget-friendly price... if you have a mutant small head like I do &#x3D;p</li>
    <li> CONS:  Gets tangled easily, lots of hair loss,  looks fake like a gold fake,  frizzy, looks weird,  bangs are off&lt;br /&gt;PROS:Looks real but not,  it&#x27;s long,  pretty,  soft</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and realistic. Poofs out as much as you need it to! I love it and its the second best wig I own(competing with a human hair wig)&lt;br /&gt;For the price its amazing. Had some trouble getting it but the wait was so worth the product. It&#x27;s true to the color, the bands are already cut but are longish so you can trim them to your liking. The wig cap is a tad tight(asian head fit) but its workable. Overall would deff buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lovely and great for the price!</li>
    <li> Its really fluffy and nice and looks like the picture! I /really/ like it! Since it was cheap I expected it to be thin and poorly made. But this is thick and really nice! I love it!</li>
    <li> L9ve this wig!!! Feels and looks real!!!! I am excited to wear it out!!! Best price ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Shipped super fast, which is definitely a plus. The only issue I had with it was that when I took it out of the packaging, it was a very nice auburn-brown color. I don&#x27;t have a problem with this (because it&#x27;s very pretty and natural looking), but if you&#x27;re looking for a specifically *light brown* wig, be warned.</li>
    <li> too long and it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
    <li> The wig just came in today and I love it so much. The hair is super soft and looks very natural. its is very wavy, its fluffier the picture show and the color is a little more chestnutty  but I still love it very much. It is super comfortable so it the wig cap that it came with. The only con is that I noticed it was shedding a lot when I was combing it out. a lot more then the other wig I have ever did. The bangs are alittle choppy and long but that doesn&#x27;t bug me because I push them to the side, but other people may want to cut them.</li>
    <li> After wearing it 3 times it&#x27;s all frizzy and falls out in chunks. Pourly sewn.</li>
    <li> Really cute look, good texture, but the wig doesn&#x27;t go all the way down my head, it&#x27;s like a half-wig. The whole bottom of my head was exposed. Good thing my own hair is pretty similar, I kept it out to give the wig some volume, but if my hair had been different it would have sucked. It needs more tracks.</li>
    <li> This is like the fifth wig I have bought lately due to an addiction to wigs that kinda sorta grew and grew, one thing about these long wigs is that they give me a headache after a while, I have short hair and am not used to the pull of long hair.  this wig is more lightweight than the others and I can wear it without gettng a headache, it isn&#x27;t thin, thin, more like realistically thiner than the thick, dollish hair wigs I&#x27;ve bought.  It looks real, especially compared to the others.</li>
    <li> Great color and texture wore it around and got a ton of compliments</li>
    <li> Its more red than it is brown, but ilove it</li>
    <li> The wig is darker brown and not as light brown as in the picture. The bangs were weird, and I couldn&#x27;t get them to be normal and straight.  After brushing once or twice it it looks kinda messy/frizzy. Like a witch.</li>
    <li> I got the browny-red version and it is very soft and a little less wavy, but still nice. It isn&#x27;t too shiny and looks like real healthy hair. The  bangs are a little long but I fixed that by sweaping then to the side. This is a great wig for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!!!!! It&#x27;s my first wig I have ever bought and I&#x27;m so happy with it. It&#x27;s darker than in the picture, more of a brown, but still gorgeous. To top it all it even came early! So all in all I would defiantly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very cute! Not as wavy, very fluffy. It can be tamed and is fragile but definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed like others said, the waves are really, pretty, smells kinda weird but ok (overall lol) LOVE dis!</li>
    <li> Thought it wouldn&#x27;t be nice for the price and some of the reviews,&lt;br /&gt;But AMAZING WIG I HAVE TO SAY&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t even look synthetic it&#x27;s gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to buy this wig, this one is PERFECT TOTALLY GET IT!!!</li>
    <li> It is BEAUTIFUL, however,  I don&#x27;t like the fullness at the bottom.  I gove it a 6 though because it&#x27;s a great fit, comfortable,  and the color is true to the advertising.</li>
    <li> Hair was frizzyand not long as picture appears but over all beautiful hair im happy and would definitly buy another</li>
    <li> Ilove the wig, it is just the way i imagine it, but you have to have patience to untangled it if not it will be a waste, other than, i love it because it doesn&#x27;t look plastic, it fit perfectly, and i love the color :)</li>
    <li> This wig is really pretty! Really great quality. The only thing that looks fake about it is the hairline and the bangs but still fun for my makeup looks!!!</li>
    <li> great for the price. fast delivery</li>
    <li> It was extremely dark and nothing at all like the color it suggests. The ends were fried like damaged hair. I trimmed the ends but they continued to fray after I wore them once. It was soft and fun to where but I suggest your use to be less for everyday and more for things like cosplay. The bangs were originally down to my chin so I had to cut them. This might work for you but I was not happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love it, the hair does not look like the photo but, it&#x27;s amazing and great quality.</li>
    <li> I give a ONE star rating on time it took to arrive.  Took almost a month longer to arrive than it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the item itself, I give FIVE stars:  Very nice quality, my daughter loves it.  Looks natural.</li>
    <li> Amazon has a lot of great products and so many to chose from.</li>
    <li> Its a little bit thin but I wear it all the time with a beanie it looks great</li>
    <li> When I ordered this wig I ordered another one with it and I knew I&#x27;d love it more than the other one even then. It arrived way earlier than what it&#x27;d said and I absolutely love it! :D it&#x27;s so pretty and soft and looks so real! I wore it out and no one knew it was even fake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s even heat resistant but I love the way it looks so much that I don&#x27;t really want to straighten or curl it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were also reviews and complaints on the color but I also love that! It&#x27;s a really beautiful light blonde with a redish hint to it. I can also put it into a messy bun, high ponytail, and a regular ponytail. Also, because of the fluffyness, it would make a great wig for a Lolita cosplay. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recomend this wig!</li>
    <li> I love it. I really recomended this hair to all girls that like look diferent some time.</li>
    <li> Great! Came sooner than expected! All that was wrong is it tangles easily! But feels like real hair! Was super impressed</li>
    <li> Its a cute wig but it has a few issues. The color is not the same as pictured. It is MUCH darker. Its also shorter. And the end of the wig look pretty awful. But with a trim that can be fixed. Despite these issues, for such a cheap price this wig is amazing.</li>
    <li> A great wig for daily wear, but is more of a mouse brown than what the picture shows. It sheds a lot and it is hard to brush or else I would give it five stars. other than that its a nice natural looking piece with comfortable adjustments, and a quality stitched lace inside. Comes with a nice hair net also.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It came very nice same waviness it showed in the picture but it was definitely a beautiful chocolate brown then the light brown they show! But it&#x27;s a very thick wig which is nice but the bangs will need to be trimmed if you want them straight across like in the picture! But over all it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> I got mine from cool2day. It is beautiful and I am very happy with it. It is darker than it looks in the picture but very realistic looking and thick. So far it doesn&#x27;t shed at all. My friend who is going through chemotherapy said it looks better than the expensive wigs she looked at in a wig shop and I ordered another one for her and one for my daughter.  It arrived way before the estimated date, about 2 weeks from when I ordered it which is great considering how far it had to come.  I can&#x27;t believe people complained about the long bangs. Better too long than too short. That&#x27;s what scissors are for. I pinned them to the sides for a bangless look and it looks great. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet so I don&#x27;t know how it holds up but for the price if I only wore it once it&#x27;s definately worth it!!</li>
    <li> very shiny and a brown/orange color, waaaay too fluffy.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely wig and looks like the photos except it&#x27;s quite a bit more red. If you are looking for a pretty redhead color, you&#x27;ll love this wig. It&#x27;s thick and the waves are beautiful. I&#x27;m happy with it even though it&#x27;s not the color pictured. The bangs came pre-cut as shown on the model.</li>
    <li> It took a while to receive, but well worth the wait. It is absolutely beautiful. It looks exactly like the picture. It is quite thick and long and very soft. I have brushed it a few times and so far none of the hair has fallen out. The bangs are a little long, but a trim will fix it. This wig is gorgeous and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great wig feels and looks real. Great price. Color was awesome.</li>
    <li> Received this today N I&#x27;m well pleased N satisfied.. Its the same as pic displayed..</li>
    <li> Nice full wig...The color is perfect (light brown), and it fit just right...Nice change of look for me....since it&#x27;s really twice as full from the pic....If you don&#x27;t mind the hair then you are okay with this one....</li>
    <li> My order came extremely quick. Amazon said February 3rd and I got it about the 2nd of January. It looks great on, if you have a larger head It wouldn&#x27;t fit too well, and if you have a lot of hair it might look odd depending on how you place your hair in the wig cap. The wig cap this came with was not that crappy nylon one that never fits anyone, it came with an open wig cap! The wig is really similar to the picture but gets puffy. Maybe its my body but it kind of looks like I have a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: hairspray takes away a lot of shine, and locks in any &amp;#34;color adjustments&amp;#34; like I added dark (almost black) brown eyeshadow to the roots, and added a similar orangeish brown (bronzer) powder through out the hair to dull the color and look more natural.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!(: Wonderful texture, incredibly soft, looks very natural, and 100 times easier to brush through than other wigs I have had. The bangs are a little (a lot) long, but I actually prefer that, because then I can cut them to frame MY individual face, and style them however I like. The only problems that I have encountered so far (and I&#x27;ve had it almost a week) are with the wig cap. Now, the adjustable straps are a very convenient, as we all have uniquely shaped skulls. However, I would recommend wearing it with your chosen placement for at least a half hour before going anywhere, especially somewhere where you cannot remove it. I made that mistake, and I was in an incredible amount of pain along my natural hairline above my forehead for longer than I would have preferred. Also, if you have the straps too tight it may cause the back of the cap to bunch upp and appear visibly unnatural. So, just experiment and find what works best for you. Over all, I absolutely adore this product!!(:</li>
    <li> This wig came faster then expected, and is perfect for the cosplay I am doing. Its a bit shiney, but not too bad. The wig cap is a bit small, but I picked up some sew in hair clips to help secure it better.</li>
    <li> was not accurate to picture what so ever. :(</li>
    <li> okay wig but a little off the color expected its a bit more light. I honestly wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> Definitely looks poofier, and a teeny bit shinier and shorter than pictured, but I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;d recommend it for somebody either cosplaying Hermione Granger or somebody who wants to look a little wild.</li>
    <li> It was thicker than I thought it would be. feels almost human. the wave did get lost in some brushings but I wanted straight hair so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Easy to wash and dry. I put some argan oil in to keep it pretty. so far holding up nicely. barely sheds. tangles a bit so I just keep it braided : )</li>
    <li> Love this wig, it looks. Little poofy when you first purchase it 😳 but once you wash it and put a little gel on it .. Looks great 😁😁😁</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product!&lt;br /&gt;shipping is super fast!&lt;br /&gt;and the value of hair is a lot!&lt;br /&gt;but for me maybe too much. more than the img that is showing.&lt;br /&gt;you will look like a doll when u wear it.&lt;br /&gt;the curl is really beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is the band is too thin, and sometimes it will show the wig cap inside.</li>
    <li> Everyone else seems to have a wavy sandy-auburn wig. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, mine is beautiful (and the best one I have) but it&#x27;s chocolate brown with silky banana curls. It doesn&#x27;t look at ALL like this one:/</li>
    <li> I really liked this wig it was so cute and not too shiny, looks so real too! I didn&#x27;t like how it was so poofy so I flatiorned it. :)</li>
    <li> This wig is the most beautiful I own. I bet if you spent time styling it, it could look just like the picture, except for the color. It&#x27;s still a pretty color, but it&#x27;s not brown. It&#x27;s a gingery red color. I still love it, and you will too, just dont expect brown.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the pictures.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> I have yet to style it, but it looks pretty realistic. The fringe and hair does not look like the photo unless STYLED. I kind of look like a witch when I wear it straight out the package.</li>
    <li> Not what I received.  Picture posted is what I received.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a couple days which I was surprised! This Wig is awesome, looks and feels real and I love it!!</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s really easy to wrk with and doesn&#x27;t tangle easy , also feels like real hair !!</li>
    <li> This wig comes wavy with well cut bangs and it comes down to my lower back but the color is not as described...it&#x27;s a very dark brown not light brown or reddish brown but I like it anyways it&#x27;s good for lolita</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but for this one I had to. I bought this wig for Halloween and thought that it would be just a regular wig, maybe even terrible since it&#x27;s only 9$. However, it is absolutely beautiful and amazing! The color isn&#x27;t spot on, it is a little darker brown and some people say they have been getting reddish ones but mine was a really nice color and I absolutely love it. The hair seems so really that it is creepy (in a good way) my roommates were shocked at how real it seemed. All in all, if you are thinking of buying it, buy it.</li>
    <li> Well, for the price it was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;A good first wig.&lt;br /&gt;The wig was lighter then I expected, it is almost strawberry blonde. The end needs to be trimmed, but that&#x27;s fixable. Other than that it is perfect and very beautiful.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous! The wig is soft and realistic BUT the color for me was golden blonde, the only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars. Pretty wig though!</li>
    <li> OK I AM DISAPPOINTED IN THIS WIG BECAUSE IT IS SO BIG AND NOT WAVY BUT FRIZZY THE WIG LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTO BUT IT WAS CHEAP 8.99 with a free wig cap so I dont know</li>
    <li> I really love this wig. It&#x27;s very thick and it&#x27;s more fluffy and a bit less wavy than shown in the picture but it&#x27;s super awesome and it looks exactly like my real hair so when I was wearing it people thought it really was my hair and I just got bangs. But now I feel comfortable cutting all my hair off and having this as a backup if I hate it.</li>
    <li> She loves wearing this wig . Loos so damn cute in it too</li>
    <li> Looks like real hair!! Only thing is that the parting isn&#x27;t realistic; right in the middle. Also not quite as long as the picture depicts and is far poofier. It&#x27;s also a light auburn bordering on redhead. The wave is beautiful however. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t get what was on the picture I got something similar to it. It&#x27;s very very fluffy but I&#x27;m sure I will be able to fix that and make it how it should be. I&#x27;m not able to see the wig cap so that&#x27;s a plus, and it doesn&#x27;t really shed. I&#x27;m pleased with it otherwise, its a great wig for that price.</li>
    <li> Nuff said. I love just got it to day and it was fast then the expected date.</li>
    <li> very soft and fairly thick</li>
    <li> It would get tangly and the waves were more kinky when I got it. I ended up cutting it t shoulder length and am much happier with it. there was a lot of hair too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few wigs and they all look fake or shinny and this is the best one I have! I was a little skeptical at first because of the price but when I received it I was in love! It looks and feels so real. I love it!</li>
    <li> The wig arrived earlier than expected, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about buying this product when reading all the bad reviews, it seemed like every client had something different to complain about and the main problem was the color wasn&#x27;t even accurate, but when I received my product the wig was a perfect fit, the color was just like the picture,it looks and feels like real hair, it was the perfect length and it even came with bobby pins to hold the wig together. This is an excellent product  and I would  definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This wig looks very little like the picture shown. Honestly this looks like Anne Hathaway&#x27;s character in the princess diaries before getting a makeover. Except it&#x27;s way frizzier. Avoid this one like the plague!</li>
    <li> Not bad quality, very soft and easy to brush. Darker than the picture shows and less curly than i expected. Cap is small to fit small heads.</li>
    <li> I usually buy cheap wigs. If you know how to work with wigs, it&#x27;s no problem. I do lots of cosplay, and none of my wigs cost more than 12 dollars. When I opened this wig, I was so impressed! It&#x27;s SOOO smooth, it feels impossible to tangle, even though it&#x27;s wavey. It&#x27;s also not thick-wavey, like the girls who get the thick ones and look like witches IMO~ LOL. This wig is perfect for ulzzang. It even has a small rubber patch at the top to look like a scalp. It is thin, but because it&#x27;s Curley it&#x27;s not very noticeable.</li>
    <li> I got this wig on time and I am in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few issues with it but they&#x27;re practically nothing speaking how cheap this wig is.&lt;br /&gt;The package it came in surprisingly did not damage the wig. I was expecting the waves to be off and that I would just have to re-braid the hair but I was completely wrong. My wig looked almost identical to the image.&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself is very fluffy and does tangled quite easily. The wig is a little small so if you have a bigger head or longer hair, you&#x27;ll find yourself fussing with your wig cap trying to hide everything.&lt;br /&gt;However, this wig is very durable in my opinion. I was able to straighten it easily on the lowest temp on my straighter without any damages to the wig.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this wig and I do recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing. It&#x27;s very soft and supper fluffy. (Which is just what I need for my Cosplay) it looks a little reddish in certain light but that&#x27;s fine. The bangs are also a little long, but that just might be me. I highly recommend purchasing this wig. It&#x27;s such a great price for such a great wig.</li>
    <li> Cute wig. The same length as the picture shown. Color is a little bit darker than the picture but it&#x27;s okay. Looks nature. Cannot wait to put it on :)</li>
