      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>the cuticles moist ladies.  :-)</li>
      <li>It might be ok for some people.  </li>

      <li>price is good, and I really like the product.</li>
      <li>If your nailpolish chips, wherever the nailpolish has fallen off will be easily breakable</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product...</li>
      <li>Out of hundreds of products from every company out there, this is hands down THE best strengthener out there (high-end and drugstore brands)!!!</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and stays on well.  </li>
      <li>and still makes it smooth.  </li>
      <li>It gives a fabulous shine and protects.</li>
      <li>Although I tried something else, still think this is a great product and won&#x27;t stray to long from it.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m happy I found the single bottle on Amazon</li>
      <li>but i now have confidence that I will have beautiful nails due to using this product.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have found to use for weak nails that easily break, chip, or split.</li>
      <li>love how this really works</li>
      <li>I just find it as good as regular nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Delivery fast but product not as strong as claims.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it claims, which is to make your nails stronger than Kevlar!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days with great success.</li>
      <li>I am glad it is clear.</li>
      <li>Not as good as I expected for the product.  </li>
      <li>For this reason, I rarely put it on after polish, but once in a while if my nails seem to be flexing, I&#x27;ll put on an additional coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nutranail came highly recommended by my sister, and she was absolutely right!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one really works!</li>
      <li>Shiney and I love how the tiny fibers reflect light...very pretty.</li>
      <li>My nails always seemed fairly healthy before I started playing last year.)</li>
      <li>Unlike the first strengthening product I tried, it hasn&#x27;t peeled off.  </li>
      <li>It made mynails stronger the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I started applying a coat every day for the first three days, but plan to go as needed from now on.</li>
      <li>I have soft fingernails, and this really works to keep them strong so they can grow longer without bending and breaking.</li>
      <li>great item I love this stuff due to my names being very fragile and short because I bite them.</li>
      <li>Its great for brittle, soft or thin nails that tend to break or tear easily.</li>
      <li>long as I apply this product faithfully, I am able to keep this nail &lt;br /&gt;in check.   </li>
      <li>It has tended to dry out my cuticles a bit, so I&#x27;ve had to be sure to apply lotion to my cuticles after I use it.  </li>
      <li>always Amazon very reliable with delivery.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This product really works and I recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s trying to grow nails..</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>Lasts a long time for me, does not chip or wear off easily.</li>
      <li>Now I have long strong nails within approx.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product to help grow out my nails, as they tend to break easily, especially when I have had my hands in water doing dishes or cleaning.</li>
      <li>They are soft and flexible and although I have tried creams and strengthener polishes, nothing has worked consistently... until Bullet-Proof.  </li>
      <li>Follow the directions on the packaging for best results (2 coats as a base, and 1 coat as a final top coat over polish if you&#x27;re wearing any).</li>
      <li>WOW!!</li>
      <li>My nails grow fast, but I&#x27;m 60 years old, and they split a lot.  </li>
      <li>* make sure to keep this product off of your cuticles because its very drying and makes them hard as well.&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
      <li>My biggest wish is that the packaging was more clear about application and drying times, as it seems to dry to the touch pretty quickly but takes some time to cure before I can subject the nails to further abuse.</li>
      <li>came fast and dries fast, actually in seconds.  </li>
      <li>I can tell a difference in the thickness &amp; strength of my nails after several weeks of consistent use.</li>
      <li>Strengthening formula to any one having trouble growing strong fingernails.</li>
      <li>When I purchased this product, I fully expected it to do everything it promised:  protect my nail color from chipping, protect my nails from easily breaking, and strengthening my nails to endure the daily rigorous routines of my hands.  </li>
      <li>The classical guitar teacher recommended this for my kids and it works really well.</li>
      <li>I still don&#x27;t have the complete nail</li>
      <li>I used to have weak nails that broke easily and wouldn&#x27;t grow much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The day after applying nail color and this Nutranail Bullet-Professional Strengthener, I noticed the white, cloudy film over my red colored nails, I noticed the nail color wearing off at the very tip of my nails</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually had to trim them for the first time in a LONG time!</li>
      <li>My nails endure a lot of abuse from typing, gardening, frequent handwashing, and handling of various kinds of equipment.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it--even if your nails aren&#x27;t dry or brittle...  </li>
      <li>have a nail that would split right down the middle no matter what I did.</li>
      <li>I had very soft, bendy, ridge-filled, short nails for 35 years prior to using this product.</li>
      <li>do put just a little on the brush and swipe the formula along the end of each nail as i paint them, making sure to get just a little underneath, which seems to help.  </li>
      <li>Nutranail Bullet-Proof is the only thing that will protect my nails long enough for them to grow to a reasonable length.</li>
      <li>It really works and out lasts any other product I have ever used.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> gloppy, wears off after two days, did nothing to protect my nails.  One tore the day after i applied it. The instructions are very poor.  They made no mention of how often it is to be applied. would like my money back</li>
    <li> Helped prevent me from biting my nails, gave them a shiny sleek sheen, and they must be stronger because I am breaking them at work less.</li>
    <li> Nutranail came highly recommended by my sister, and she was absolutely right!  My nails grow fast, but I&#x27;m 60 years old, and they split a lot.  This is THE solution to the problem.  It also seems to make my polish last longer, too.  It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle!  I highly recommend it--even if your nails aren&#x27;t dry or brittle...  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one really works! My nails have always broken and they are as hard as steel now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days with great success. It really seems to be reinforcing the weak spots on my nail sustained from hours of ukulele strumming. (Yes, even soft nylon uke strings can eat away your nails if you hit them hard and often enough! My nails always seemed fairly healthy before I started playing last year.) It&#x27;s even holding together a low break on my thumb nail. Unlike the first strengthening product I tried, it hasn&#x27;t peeled off.  The finish is glossy with short polymer threads that almost look like tiny scuffs or scratches. It would probably be covered by regular cosmetic nail polish, though I haven&#x27;t tried any. It seems to go on thicker than regular nail polish and application requires more care than I&#x27;m used to for thin, even coats. Thicker coats don&#x27;t really drip, but form uneven ridges.  I started applying a coat every day for the first three days, but plan to go as needed from now on. My biggest wish is that the packaging was more clear about application and drying times, as it seems to dry to the touch pretty quickly but takes some time to cure before I can subject the nails to further abuse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with the stuff for years. My nails endure a lot of abuse from typing, gardening, frequent handwashing, and handling of various kinds of equipment. Also, I pick at them. As a result, they are usually stubby, painfully short and peeling. Nutranail Bullet-Proof is the only thing that will protect my nails long enough for them to grow to a reasonable length. I can&#x27;t fault it in any way. You just have to try it!</li>
    <li> I buy this often.  I have soft fingernails, and this really works to keep them strong so they can grow longer without bending and breaking.</li>
    <li> Nutranail Bullet-Proof is very good polish to keep your nails from snagging. I am glad it is clear. It stays on very good. I would definitely recommend it .</li>
    <li> This item works just as it says. I have only used it alone, but it would be wonderful over your nail polish to keep it from chipping. And as it hasn&#x27;t chipped when wearing it alone, I&#x27;m sure over polish you can use it for a fraction of the cost of salon shellac nails.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a several years now. I used to have weak nails that broke easily and wouldn&#x27;t grow much. With-in a few weeks, my nails were growing and were stronger than ever. Definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> very much love.. growing again already</li>
    <li> This is the only nail polish that works on my nails (besides getting gel nails at the salon).  I love it.  I&#x27;ve been able to grow my nails longer and keep them looking much better with this nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It bonds to the nail in a long lasting way, at least 10 to 14 days! I wash my hands or have them in water constantly, or I am handling items that keep my hands &amp; nail very dry. Bullet-proof nail strenthener doesn&#x27;t peel or chip off. If I pick at it or try to scrap it off, it is obivious that I am scraping off a layer of finger nail too. That stick-to-your-nail-ness is great to prevent me from picking at my polish, which in turn, damages my nails. I can tell a difference in the thickness &amp; strength of my nails after several weeks of consistent use. Love this product - did I say that already? Cannot find it in stores anymore to thrilled to find it on Amazon. I have had great success with many Nutra-Nail products.</li>
    <li> I had very soft, bendy, ridge-filled, short nails for 35 years prior to using this product. As I type this now, my nails are hitting the screen of my iPad with a hard click. My nails are HARD AS CRYSTAL GLASS with this product. I wear it under the polish and over the polish as suggested on the bottle and it looks like I have a beautiful shellac finish. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this product. It does exactly what it claims, which is to make your nails stronger than Kevlar! Follow the directions on the packaging for best results (2 coats as a base, and 1 coat as a final top coat over polish if you&#x27;re wearing any). Additionally, I have gone over my finished DIY french manicure design everyday with this wonder product (I am hard on my hands) and my nails just keep that fresh manicure look! Out of hundreds of products from every company out there, this is hands down THE best strengthener out there (high-end and drugstore brands)!!!</li>
    <li> I used Nutra Nail products years ago and can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.  So glad I found it on again.  It really works and out lasts any other product I have ever used.  I am not constantly working on my nails.</li>
    <li> This has been my standby strengthner for years.  Although I tried something else, still think this is a great product and won&#x27;t stray to long from it. I like that it does not leave a yellow tinge on Nails like another product.  I can wear French tips and see the whiteness rather than a tinge of yellow.</li>
    <li> Like putting on another coat of nail polish.  does not really strengthen the nails.  Would not buy this product again.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t awful but didn&#x27;t really improve strength.</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product...Nutranail Bullet Strength.  It is a recent purchase but i now have confidence that I will have beautiful nails due to using this product.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter was a nail biter, but not since she started using Nutra Nails with Kevlar. Her nails are georgeous!!</li>
    <li> I am truly satisfied with this product. In the past I&#x27;ve used other products and they didn&#x27;t work, however this product did. My nails are growing and much more strong. I recommend Nutranail Bullet-Proof Strengthening formula to any one having trouble growing strong fingernails.</li>
    <li> came fast and dries fast, actually in seconds.  It does dry shiny and I am a male. I didn&#x27;t plan on that.</li>
    <li> I have a problem growing my nails out without them peeling or bending.  They are soft and flexible and although I have tried creams and strengthener polishes, nothing has worked consistently... until Bullet-Proof.  I can put two coats on (it dries quite quickly), and I&#x27;m good do go for a week.  This ensures peeling stops in it&#x27;s tracks and that my nails are HARD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do put just a little on the brush and swipe the formula along the end of each nail as i paint them, making sure to get just a little underneath, which seems to help.  if you overload the brush it can cause a ridge of this stuff under the edge of the nail (which I have a habit of picking at), but just a touch coats the underside and still makes it smooth.  For this reason, I rarely put it on after polish, but once in a while if my nails seem to be flexing, I&#x27;ll put on an additional coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this still gets five stars.  I love it and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a base coat, but one thing you should be aware of is that should you use it on top of a polish, the Kevlar fibers seem to be noticeable-- so the finish you get ends up not looking shiny.  With a pearlescent or gloss polish, this will make a difference</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and stays on well.  Used as a base coat and strengthener.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected for the product.  Delivery fast but product not as strong as claims.  Would buy from seller again though.</li>
    <li> I am a classical guitarist, and have tried various methods to keep my nails from breaking. This product, which has kevlar, is excellent. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> After removing my acrylics this stuff helped my nails to grown out until I had healthy nails again. Lasts a long time for me, does not chip or wear off easily. Shiney and I love how the tiny fibers reflect light...very pretty.</li>
    <li> I thought I was to receive the item with Kevlar fibers and I do not thint it is. The price and shipping makes it still a good value</li>
    <li> My nails haven&#x27;t improved at all, still splitting just as badly, wish I had not wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I would say that product works, but a couple of my nails still cracked and I had to cut them short. I gave it a little time before I wrote a review because I thought maybe it needed time to work, but a month and a half after using it as the directions read every week, I am still not seeing the result that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is better than nothing, but no better than plain clear nail polish.</li>
    <li> It might be ok for some people.  I just find it as good as regular nail polish.  Does not stop my nails from splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always Amazon very reliable with delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years. I use to have weak brittle nails. Now I have long strong nails within approx. 2 weeks of applying 1 or 2 coats.</li>
    <li> This has been a perfect solution for a problematic nail-chipping issue. Besides that, they were thin and kept chipping. I decided to try this and I tell you, my nails have not been healthier. It gives a fabulous shine and protects.</li>
    <li> When purchasing this product I was under the impression it was going to help strengthen my nails so that they could grow long. It&#x27;s the same as clear coat but more expensive. Using a base coat, color, and top coat work just the same to keep nails strong. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> If you want a nail polish that stays on for weeks and weeks order this product. It keeps your nail polish on too.  In additon, it keeps your nails very strong and helps prevent breaking and chipping.</li>
    <li> Its ok, but not as effective as advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s drying and splitting my nails badly. My nails are now worse then before.</li>
    <li> Best product for splitting and ridgy nails!</li>
    <li> Liked it.  Does a good job Protecting and strengthening  nails.  I have recommended it to my friends and they agree.&lt;br /&gt;MJC</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three weeks, two to three times a week.  The day after my last application two nails chipped.  My nails have been breaking every day as usual. This product did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> This product really works and I recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s trying to grow nails..&lt;br /&gt;In the drugstores I can only find the duo set which includes the top coat ( by the way the topcoat has awesome shine). But I&#x27;m happy I found the single bottle on Amazon I have too many bottles of topcoat now. You will use this over and over again because it works..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** make sure to keep this product off of your cuticles because its very drying and makes them hard as well.&lt;br /&gt;Dry cuticles impact the nails too&amp;#34;.  I learned this lesson the hard way and ended up clipping my nails. Try to&lt;br /&gt;Keep the cuticles moist ladies.  :-)</li>
    <li> It sort&#x27;ve makes your nails stronger but it only lasts while the polish is on. If your nailpolish chips, wherever the nailpolish has fallen off will be easily breakable</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product to help grow out my nails, as they tend to break easily, especially when I have had my hands in water doing dishes or cleaning. I am so impressed! I applied the product, as well as a clear coat, and my nails have grown so much in the past 3 or 4 weeks. I&#x27;ve actually had to trim them for the first time in a LONG time! I remove it and reapply once a week and it looks great.  It has tended to dry out my cuticles a bit, so I&#x27;ve had to be sure to apply lotion to my cuticles after I use it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was advertised to have kevlar fibers. &lt;br /&gt;It sounded like it might solve a problem I&#x27;ve had for years. &lt;br /&gt;I have a nail that would split right down the middle no matter what I did. &lt;br /&gt;I had tried the little plastic glue-on shields, nail repair material, etc., but they were messy and ineffective.   &lt;br /&gt;As long as I apply this product faithfully, I am able to keep this nail &lt;br /&gt;in check.   &lt;br /&gt;The product looks like any other base/top coat when applied. &lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> love how this really works</li>
    <li> The classical guitar teacher recommended this for my kids and it works really well.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found to use for weak nails that easily break, chip, or split. price is good, and I really like the product.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product, I fully expected it to do everything it promised:  protect my nail color from chipping, protect my nails from easily breaking, and strengthening my nails to endure the daily rigorous routines of my hands.  Instead, what I got was a very odd reaction and one that I haven&#x27;t had with any other top or base coat:  it left a white cloudy film over my nails that could not be rubbed off.  WHAT??!!??  I know... that&#x27;s what I said too.  I thought it was weird and odd.  The film eventually \\&quot;went away\\&quot; or wore off but it happened after each time my hands were in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after applying nail color and this Nutranail Bullet-Professional Strengthener, I noticed the white, cloudy film over my red colored nails, I noticed the nail color wearing off at the very tip of my nails (something I would expect after a week or two, but NOT the day after applying the polish),  and I noticed my nails were not shiny.  Since it did not protect my nail color from wearing down I don&#x27;t think it was protective of my nails at all so I was disappointed in this product and I will not be buying it again.  Bottom line:  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Have been using since I had my artificial nails removed.  This is always a hassle but this item seems to be helping harden the nails.  I still don&#x27;t have the complete nail yet but I&#x27;m almost there.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I started using it years ago, but the local stores stopped selling it. My mom even uses it now.&lt;br /&gt;Just apply two coats under any base or color. It needs to be reapplied every couple days. You will see results in a week (sometimes two if your nails are slow to grow like mine). Its great for brittle, soft or thin nails that tend to break or tear easily. And if your a nail biter it makes it harder for you to chew them away.</li>
    <li> great item I love this stuff due to my names being very fragile and short because I bite them. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I use the regular Nutra nail and thought I would try this one.  WOW!! It made mynails stronger the first time I used it. Now I put it under my nail polish or wear it alone. I will definetly order it again. LOVE IT!!!</li>
