<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this contributed to my ability to spend time with attractive people but I will probably buy more. It&#x27;s fun. Not sure if this has pheremones or is just marketing, dunno.</li>
    <li> saying it this way is an excellent shower gel nothing else, what of pheromones and attractive girls in that if I do not believe it has anything seem more special than just a shower gel ..... 👍</li>
    <li> Nothing special and overpriced.</li>
    <li> I am a woman and this stuff repels me. It definitely DOES NOT attract me... I hate the way it smells. When my boyfriend uses this I make him reshower and use my body wash. Not only does this body wash affect my nose, but it also makes my eyes burn. The old man orange bars of soap smell much more appealing than this body wash.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and performing body wash. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years. Lathers up well and the proof is in that it helped attract my wife! Haha She loves how it leaves me smelling.</li>
    <li> was able to purchase even though all local stores were out of stock for a week.</li>
    <li> best body wash I have used.  others sour on me as I go through out my day.  scent lasts and everyone tells me I smell great especially the ladies!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and (when on sale) the price is right. I got it more over the fact that it&#x27;s cheap. I&#x27;m not entirely sold on the pheromone-infused part, but my girlfriend makes sure I keep my focus on her so i can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Not so sure about the attraction part because the scent doesn&#x27;t really linger after you rinse and dry off but it gets you clean and smells decent...not girly.</li>
    <li> I assume a significant portion of the positive reviews on here are just attempts to be funny based on the &amp;#34;pheromone-infused&amp;#34; aspect of the product. The rest of the positive reviews must come from customers that are olfactory-challenged. This body wash combines the worst scents of Polo, Brut, Old Spice, and Axe into one unholy stench that burns the nostrils. I have used it a few times after my personal shower gel ran out, and I honestly debated whether or not this scent was more embarrassing than natural body odor (which-- ironically-- probably contains more pheromones). However, it does leave you feeling clean and is functional in that regard, so I gave it 2 stars. But anyone even remotely sensitive to strong scents should stay away from this.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells wonderful. I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure. The &amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34; affect, I&#x27;m unsure of. I imagine you need pheromones in concentrated exposed areas to have the &amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34; affect. I think it might be too diluted like this.</li>
    <li> So I used this product right along with Lucky you cologne, and immediately I noticed a disturbing change in my daily life.I walked into work that morning and all I could see were the primal eyes of my female co-workers as they peeked over their cubicles in lust.Even my boss started physically touching me and flirting ever so often during the day. Never again will I get in trouble for molesting badgers, in hopes of making the perfect scent. Im not sure what God-like creature dial decided to take glandular secretions from, but I will find out!! Until then I will keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this Body wash and i would buy it again. However as far as the body wash having Phermones in it and if they work i am not sure. it would nice to say that some woman were nice to me Because i had used this item but it is a Good body wash. it feels good after you use it which is a plus but i don&#x27;t know if it will get  woman chasing you after using it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I thought with a named brand manufacture it would be much better.</li>
    <li> Aside from being an actual body wash, the subtle androtic ingredient smell is enough -than not- to keep things alive. I can count on one hand the times I&#x27;ve received accolades on the smell of soaps I&#x27;ve used thus far in my life but this soap seems to induce a more -closer physical proximity action than any other body wash.</li>
    <li> with science.  The first time I went out at night after trying this body wash, I hit on three women.  One rated at a (3), the next a (6), and the last at a (9).  I generally get pretty solid hook up results with sevens and below, but that night I was able to have intercourse with all three women.    I&#x27;m not sure if it was the pheromones, or my elevated confidence level from washing with the ink consistency wash, but I was definitely followed by like thirty female cats in heat each time I walked from the bar to the lady in questions&#x27; place.    So, I don&#x27;t know if it works on human females, but if you like intercourse with stray cats; well, let&#x27;s just say you&#x27;re in for a long night.</li>
    <li> Great smell and cleaning power. I have gotten some nice compliments from ladies when I am not wearing anything else!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Cleans the skin and makes just the correct amount of lather.</li>
    <li> Chicks dig me because I rarely wear underwear and if I do it&#x27;s usually something unusual. I find the product to be useful, as it gives off a vibe of danger and proceed at your own risk ladies, which is usually my modus operendi anyway! Groovey...</li>
    <li> This is mens body wash, ladies you have 100&#x27;s to pick from. I like the smell very much and use it on special occasions. Haven&#x27;t had any women romantically attack me yet except my wife, who does it regardless of what I use.</li>
    <li> My girl friend and I like the its subtle smell from the very first time. I got some nice compliments from her. It’s an amazing body wash.  I will get a few more bottles in the future. But for now I will use it only for especial occasions.</li>
    <li> Got this so I can cut back on wearing to much cologne at night when I sleep with my wife but still wanted to smell great for her and this does just that i don&#x27;t believe it does anything more then smell great these products are known for; if nothing having a great smell and that&#x27;s why I got this and will recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> OK I am a married man for 25 years to the same woman. I remember and longed for the days when my wife, then girlfriend, couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off of me. We have always been active in the bedroom so to speak, but I guess I just wanted her to want it more and have more of a desire. Purchased this product not expecting much but willing to give it a shot. Have been using it to shower on occasion and, to my surprise, have very much noticed her behaving differently. A lot more aggressive and willing to do new things  to quell her desire, which she seems to have a lot of when I have used this. Her orgasms are more intense and quicker than without it. Now don&#x27;t expect to have women chasing you down at the store but if you have a woman you love and would like her to be more &amp;#34;into it&amp;#34; give this a try. It&#x27;s a good clean body wash besides. What can it hurt.</li>
    <li> The only females attracted by this product are canine and generally they aren&#x27;t going to take &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; for an answer. I started using this product seven weeks ago and so far have noticed no more attention than normal from human women. But on the third day of use, as I was walking to my car to start another day of work at the sausage mill where I am employed, I was jumped by a hundred-pound female pit bull and brutally dry-humped in front of the neighbors. At first I didn&#x27;t connect the assault with the body wash but since then, it has happened at least 24 more times. Think long and hard before you use this product.</li>
    <li> Stuff is Amazing Women look like they want to do the no pants dance when getting a whiff of me. Fragrance that last and keeps your pissy smelling natural skin smelling musky yet clean. Responsible for rounding them dames out real nice like. Dial you did it right on this one. Keep it up.</li>
    <li> turned out to be just regular soap nothing special, smells nice though and for the price i&amp;ntilde;l buy it again</li>
    <li> For some reason, the soap doesn&#x27;t lather up really well. It&#x27;s kind of strange because I buy this version elsewhere and it&#x27;s great but when I order it here it&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s been watered down. It&#x27;s lacking the consistency of the other Dial body washes. It does have a great scent.</li>
    <li> this its a&lt;br /&gt;1 of the best pheromones products i have so far the smell its good  i love the smell</li>
    <li> Dial Body Wash, have not been able to find this brand in our local market for sometime, ran across on Amazon, the price was right&lt;br /&gt;so i bought 3. last all day and was received with excellent packaging</li>
    <li> First off it smells good which you can check that online. Second I use this along with this product [[ASIN:B0035UUFR0 B0035UUFR0]]&lt;br /&gt;Both imbue pheromones and although I&#x27;ve used this since I started school again I can tell I get a lot of attention from girls, Some of it is from getting older but girls I dont even know start checking me out and its a nice feeling that I attribute to pheromones.</li>
    <li> This is a good solution when compared to paying 10x as much for comparable products. I have noticed a difference in how random women treat me - a lot more touchy feely. :-)</li>
    <li> Great price,excellent service strongly reccomend</li>
    <li> was totally happy with this soap until, not thinking, i used it to wash my dog. upon returning home from work the following evening i was shocked and disgusted to find my wife performing a sexual act on our dog boomer. the pheromones in this body wash have destroyed my marriage. i will never look at my wife or my dog the same way again. aside from that, it&#x27;s a pretty good soap, however i would not recommend shooting the soap directly into your eyes in attempt to wash away the disturbing image of finding your wife of 15 years with your beloved family pet. that being said, i still love dial products, but i think i&#x27;ll be sticking with the classic non-pheromone-infused varies in the future.</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the best body washes I&#x27;ve used if not the best- amazing smell girls are always telling me I smell good and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper on here than in the store! I stock up on it because I went to the store the other day and they weren&#x27;t selling it and I got scared and sure enough Amazon saved the day once again.</li>
    <li> smells great and blends well with my other cologne, put on the wrists or wherever your body is in contact or brush&#x27;s up against you is the ideal area to apply it. great job shipping thru the post office versus oops ,or fed up.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve used pheromone stuff before around my wife and she really seems to truly enjoy the smell no matter what company I get it from. She really likes this body wash too, I&#x27;m not disappointed. I think the results vary simply because that&#x27;s the way humans are wired. But coming from my wife who as really liked the smell of pheromone stuff before, she really enjoyed this one, and has nuzzled up on me quite a few times so I expect it would work just as well in attracting other women that are attuned to this synthetic pheromone.</li>
    <li> good soap, but doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the Mrs.  I have tried other products with success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, it is a great body wash.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that great, and women aren&#x27;t ripping my clothes off.</li>
    <li> i like the smell of this body wash, i dont know about the magnetic attraction quality&#x27;s it has or doesn&#x27;t have, i have never seen a differences one way or the another</li>
    <li> Nice, refreshing and clean scent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Women love the scent and I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> I bought this the other day and though it smelled ok after opening the top and sniffing. I showered with it, but I didn&#x27;t smell as strong or almost at all compared to my previous body wash (Old Spice After Hours). I said hi to a female co worker and she stopped and said something smelled good. She said oh..that&#x27;s you. So even though I don&#x27;t really smell it once it has been used to clean myself, apparently others are able to smell it. I say give it a try since most the name brand body washes cost about the same.</li>
    <li> When sales are slow, the price of this item drops drastically.  That is a scandalous $5 difference in price.  Other than that, the product is excellent and pretty much deliveres on its promises.</li>
    <li> For its price, this is an amazing body wash for men. I enjoyed it a lot with cold water and it feels like the summer is never ends even in the cold winter. I will definitely go back and purchase a new one in need.</li>
    <li> good stuff refreshing.</li>
    <li> refreshing, i get complimented on how i smell</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband. We always purchase dial bath products, and dial hand pump soap. When I seen this for the price ,I New it was great price.got it.my husband loves the smell of it.I can always tell he just took a shower. He smells so good..I am glad he likes it.now he will alwAys have the male dial pump soap.and I will use the woman,s dial soap.not only does it smell great. It also disinfected.and germs from your body..great deal..Thanks Cynthia Schmidt</li>
    <li> It smells ok. Unfortunately, and maybe I expected too much because I went by reviews of the product, I didn&#x27;t get the complements from the women I thought I would. Also, the item is cheaper in stores that stock it. With that said, I do not regret getting the item, I just expected too much from it.</li>
    <li> Smells good and I&#x27;m not sure if pheromones  effective but will buy again</li>
    <li> It smells good and it seems like women wanna talk more and they pay more attention to me when I talk. They laugh more too.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few weeks and have not seen no difference in what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend on a whim. I didn&#x27;t really expect much since it&#x27;s made by Dial. Lol. Nothing against Dial, just not a company that makes me go, OH BOY!! Wasn&#x27;t home the first time the guy used it but when I reached for my loofah I was overwhelmed with this incredible aroma!! It smelled like a warrior god had snuck into my bathroom and scrubbed himself with my loofah! Oh my!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you drive a puce Prius, this is not for you! If you even know what &amp;#34;puce&amp;#34; is, keep on moving. If the mere thought of wrenching around under the hood of a burly freakin truck makes your soft hands hurt, go buy some fluffy Axe shower gel. If you carry a man purse or own a cute little dog, move along! This stuff is not for the faint at heart! Shower gel may be for sissies, but not anymore!!  If you usually bathe with degreaser, you just might be manly enough to use THIS shower gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this shower gel, you WILL grow more chest hair, a manly stinkin beard and giant biceps. You will also sprout a chiseled jaw line, abs of steel and legs as big as tree trunks.  You will be given a promotion at work in which you will constantly find yourself surrounded by beautiful women.  Your own woman will never ask you to go shopping with her or bore you with the details of her trip to the hair/nail salon, but she will always have a cold beer ready for you the moment you finish one up. You will be the toughest son of a gun in your state if not then entire country! You&#x27;ll operate an 80 lb. jackhammer with one hand while eating a 5 pound beef burger with the other. You WILL trade in your shower loofah and toothbrush for a roll of 80 grit and a wire brush. You will eat electric cars and vegans for breakfast and crap out rebar enforced concrete and chainsaws by lunch. If that doesn&#x27;t sound like a great way to spend your day, then buy some Dove body soap.</li>
    <li> Got this for a good friend for doung me a favor. Said he likes the body wash but what it has in it does nothing for him.. whatevers in it really dont do its job</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the item on a lark from the clearance section of a major retail chain.  I enjoyed it enough to switch it to my main shower soap.  I&#x27;ve made multiple purchases from Amazon of it - and my 15 year old claims a bottle as his own whenever the package arrives.  He&#x27;s a reformed &amp;#34;Axe man.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produces a nice amount of bubbles to clean ans washes away easily and completely - no vigorous scrubbing needed and no post rinse sticky feeling.  The scent in strong in that I can smell it for about an hour or so after getting out of the shower.  I have sensitivities to certain scents but this does not trigger the sensitivity reaction.  I find the scent pleasing, as does my wife.  If we&#x27;re planning on going out shortly after my shower, because of the strength of the scent I either don&#x27;t use a cologne or will use an unscented body soap and cologne. I don&#x27;t want to spend time trying to find which cologne mixes well with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the &#x27;pheromone infused&#x27; goes, my wife like to cuddle anyway and the scent doesn&#x27;t keep her away - she actually likes it and, if she catches me before I can get dressed again, she likes to take the towel away and snuggle in my chest hairs and deeply breathe.  The family cats, both girls, will follow my every footstep for quite awhile after my shower.  I have had people ask me what I&#x27;m cologne I&#x27;m wearing and times all I can say is that it&#x27;s this body wash.  The &#x27;pheromone&#x27; thing might just be their marketing attempt to get a young crowd who falls for the pipe dreams offered by axe commercials.</li>
    <li> Went to wal-mart the other day and bought (2) bottles 16fl.oz each for $3.67 each bottles smells good</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous product, this Magnetic Attraction Enhancing Body Wash Men by Dial, 16 Ounce. While I thoroughly enjoy it in a hot shower, I sometimes use a cold shower rinse for toning. It smells great coming off, too! [[ASIN:B00CD8EOV8 Magnetic Attraction Enhancing Body Wash Men by Dial, 16 Ounce]].</li>
    <li> I do love the smell.  It does not dry out your skin and it seems to keep your body fresh through the day.</li>
    <li> The fragrance lingers a long time. I did order more for my husband and for gifts.</li>
    <li> It has a great smell and you feel fresh after taking a shower. It really gives that manly feeling, just great.</li>
