      <li>I do wish they would offer more shades of colors and bigger sizes, like they used to.</li>
      <li>It is the right make up and the right color, but a smaller container than it originally came in.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy Max until they quit manufacturing it or change the formula too much.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I used it when it was available locally.</li>
      <li>I have used Max Factor Panstik foundation since I was a junior in high school.  </li>
      <li>I can live with that, though.  </li>
      <li>The only problem I have with the &#x27;new&#x27; Max is that they have changed the color of True Beige and it is lighter, and of course, the price increased and the amount you get is much smaller than before the company went overseas.  </li>
      <li>I am in my early fifties now, and I still get compliments on my skin/make-up.  </li>
      <li>The difference I found was your True Beige is not as dark as it</li>
      <li>I cannot afford the original product which was creamy pan stick in true beige,it cost is crazy like 90.00 I use to pay 12.00.</li>
      <li>The formula seems a little less creamy than it used to be years ago, and it comes in a smaller tube that costs more.</li>

    <li> I love Max Factor Pan Stick makeup!!  The size is much smaller than I used to purchase in the local stores, but I am happy to find this makeup available on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my wife. So used this years ago so she decided to try it again. It is exactly how she remembered it. Upon delivery it was smaller in size than expected but an excellent product none the less. Worth the money paid for it. She is very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, and seems to have been discontinued in the U.S.  But why have we gone to such a tiny tube?  That is disheartening.</li>
    <li> I love the full coverage of this foundation, not to mention how convinient it is to carry around.</li>
    <li> Product was alot smaller tube than I used to buy product still good 3 star&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Met my expectations as always! TRIED AND TRUE</li>
    <li> It is the right make up and the right color, but a smaller container than it originally came in.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Much smaller but happy Amazon has it, lived it years ago, wore it all the time</li>
    <li> It keeps my skin smooth and young looking</li>
    <li> We were delighted to find this product on amazon. My wife has used it for years and is unable to find it in any of the stores any more.  The size was not as big as she had purchased in the past but getting a 2pack for a good price was great.....Happy Wife one more time....Thanks</li>
    <li> I have used Max Factor Panstik foundation since I was a junior in high school.  Over the years, I have tried other make up brands from extremely expensive to extremely cheap, but nothing can beat Max&#x27;s coverage and creaminess.  Several years ago when I discovered the stores were no longer going to carry it,  I found it on-line on Amazon, thank goodness.  The only problem I have with the &#x27;new&#x27; Max is that they have changed the color of True Beige and it is lighter, and of course, the price increased and the amount you get is much smaller than before the company went overseas.  I can live with that, though.  I&#x27;ll buy Max until they quit manufacturing it or change the formula too much.  I am in my early fifties now, and I still get compliments on my skin/make-up.  Thanks, Max!</li>

    <li> I love this product...have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This is so tiny, I would rather have a larger size.</li>
    <li> I like the Pan Stick. I used it when it was available locally. The difference I found was your True Beige is not as dark as it&lt;br /&gt;was when I wore it before. This one makes me look pale. Had I known I would have ordered one darker.</li>
    <li> The formula seems a little less creamy than it used to be years ago, and it comes in a smaller tube that costs more.

    <li> Great option for those that love panstick</li>
    <li> Great makeup. Yes, the container is small, but I don&#x27;t use a lot so it works for me. True Beige is as I remember it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. Sad that Max Factor has left the US.</li>
    <li> love this make up! got my order very quickly!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 40 years! It stopped being sold in th U.S.A,so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.I cannot afford the original product which was creamy pan stick in true beige,it cost is crazy like 90.00 I use to pay 12.00. I don&#x27;t understand this,but I am thrilled to get it in the stick,just not creamy.</li>
    <li> Very pleased to have found this. Excellent foundation although very small size. So order more than one when you settle on tint.</li>
