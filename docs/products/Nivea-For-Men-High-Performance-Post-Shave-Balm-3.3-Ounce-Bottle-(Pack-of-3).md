      <li>Makes my face and neck feel really nice.</li>
      <li>This is the best smelling after shave I&#x27;ve ever used, and it also soothes my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>and I just love the smell.</li>
      <li>when many of us may not yet be fully awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes your face feel better and soothed after shaving immediately.    </li>
      <li>she doesn&#x27;t like most smells.  </li>
      <li>This was the cheapest and the overall best quality.</li>
      <li>If you use the right amount, though, it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
      <li>Better price than local stores,  very good deal.  </li>
      <li>My face feels smooth and soft and happy after I&#x27;m done shaving.</li>
      <li>This is a good deal for the only kind of aftershave</li>
      <li>It was fine with me that is comes in a pack of 3 since I already know we like it.</li>
      <li>It feels slightly cheap coming in the plastic bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever found 100% comfortable.</li>
      <li>Its still the same great product, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with delivery, but I do wish it came in the glass bottles.</li>
      <li>Like most moisturizers, if it&#x27;s old it kind of gets a sort of plasticy smell.  </li>
      <li>We receive it quickly and it is packed well.</li>
      <li>a repeat customer, you can infer that I must be very pleased with the quality of this German product, and I truly am.</li>
      <li>It works very well clean light scent, and calms shaving irritation.  </li>
      <li>I only knocked 1 star since the product works great, and I don&#x27;t think the smell is normal.</li>
      <li>Good smell and lotion is neither greasy or too dry.  </li>
      <li>this 3 pack will last me a long time and I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin, as it is important that you feel comfortable after your shave.</li>
      <li>- It soaks into your skin pretty quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on your clothes or anything else after you put it on.    </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s time to loose your whiskers for whatever reason, you would be well advised to use this fine product to put your post-shaving, friction-stressed skin back on the road to dermatological happiness - highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really like this product from Nivea.  </li>
      <li>I apply this after I shave and it is very soothing.</li>
      <li>After much persistence, I tried a swatch on my neck.</li>
      <li>Really helps control</li>
      <li>Really soothes the skin and does not burn.  </li>
      <li>Being able to purchase it here online at a cost that is about $1.00 per bottle lower than what is available locally with no shipping charges and no sales tax, as well as the convenience of door-to-door delivery only adds to my overall satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>only concern with these big company products is how many unsafe ingredients they may be ladeling in to the mix (preservatives, etc.)</li>
      <li>While that&#x27;s nice, what utterly sells me on eXtreme Comfort is the fact that I don&#x27;t stink after using it.</li>
      <li>- It doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfumed smell like some other products do.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only does it have a pleasing scent, but it also cools and soothes the skin while providing a refreshing facial pick-me-up early in the morning</li>
      <li>I only wish Nivea would come up with a scent-free or female friendly scented version.</li>
      <li>A little bit better than competitive brands in the same price range.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin on my neck after shaving.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin; it really helps.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I find that this particular shave balm is far superior to the traditional harsh/irritating or even painful experience of using an alcohol-based aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was concerned the product would further irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I used to shave every two or three days with an electric shaver, first because long hair makes it easier to shave and second due to an irritation I always get around my neck area.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no granola all natural type but keep the products simple and as close to nature as possible and we&#x27;ll all live a little longer.</li>
      <li>The old scent from last year was better, but the new scent isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
      <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if you use too much of it, it can get just a little bit greasy.  </li>

    <li> I have used this product for years and can only find it by shopping through amazon. Each time</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin on my neck after shaving.  This does not burn and has almost&lt;br /&gt;no smell to it.  You dont need much, just a small drop goes a long way.  Would definitly buy this again.</li>
    <li> I used to shave every two or three days with an electric shaver, first because long hair makes it easier to shave and second due to an irritation I always get around my neck area. Now I put a small amount of the nivea balm after shaving and never get irritated even dough I live in the tropic, I&#x27;m shaving every day, hurray!!!</li>
    <li> This balm works! My face feels smooth and soft and happy after I&#x27;m done shaving. While that&#x27;s nice, what utterly sells me on eXtreme Comfort is the fact that I don&#x27;t stink after using it. The smell is mild and practically delicate compared to other brands of aftershave.</li>

    <li> Makes my face and neck feel really nice. Really helps control the after shave burn. I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin; it really helps.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item on Amazon because I could not find it anywhere in stores anymore. I rely on it after every shave. The old scent from last year was better, but the new scent isn&#x27;t bad. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin, as it is important that you feel comfortable after your shave.</li>
    <li> I really like this product from Nivea.  Reasons to buy this are:    - It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like some other products do.    - A bottle lasts a really long time.    - It makes your face feel better and soothed after shaving immediately.    - It soaks into your skin pretty quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on your clothes or anything else after you put it on.    - It doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfumed smell like some other products do.  - And I even like the nice bottle it comes in.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this aftershave for years and I just love the smell. We&#x27;ve had a harder time finding it in stores recently so it was so nice to be able to find it on Amazon! It was fine with me that is comes in a pack of 3 since I already know we like it. I will probably order this again when my husband gets low on his current supply!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a long time, but nobody in my town sells it anymore. This is a good deal for the only kind of aftershave I&#x27;ve ever found 100% comfortable.</li>
    <li> I guess they quit making this, because I only see the yellow labeled Nivea now.  I much prefer the green and its lime-like scent. So, I stocked up.</li>
    <li> I bought this and multiple other post shave balms. This was the cheapest and the overall best quality. Recommend to all</li>
    <li> I chose it because I bought it before and could not find it locally.  I have always liked it because of the scent and consistency.</li>
    <li> After shave balm does not blow up anybody&#x27;s skirt but this product does it&#x27;s intended job and works well.  I ordered on Amazon for it reviews and cannot find it in stores.  It works very well clean light scent, and calms shaving irritation.  A little bit better than competitive brands in the same price range.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff to replace the Nivea after shave balm with COQ10 I have been using for a while, due to it making my skin itch.  This stuff works great.  My only complaint is it kind of stinks.  It had an \\&quot;old\\&quot; smell to it.  Like most moisturizers, if it&#x27;s old it kind of gets a sort of plasticy smell.  Since I can&#x27;t find this in stores, and here I needed to buy a 3 pack, I am wondering how long this stuff has been sitting around in the warehouse, or wherever it&#x27;s kept.  I only knocked 1 star since the product works great, and I don&#x27;t think the smell is normal.</li>
    <li> Ever since i switched to soaps for my wet shave, i have noticed my skin has been drying out. I apply this after I shave and it is very soothing. this 3 pack will last me a long time and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, buying at whichever store I was around when I ran out. I saw it was part of the Amazon subscription program, and signed up for it that way. Its still the same great product, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with delivery, but I do wish it came in the glass bottles. It feels slightly cheap coming in the plastic bottle. No complaints other than that.</li>
    <li> This will be an odd review, as I am a woman. My husband has used this Nivea Anti Irritation post shave balm product for quite sometime and he swears by it.  I recently had a bout of rashes and irritation on my body. After months of prescription creams and pills, nothing worked to relieve and eliminate the awful rashes. One night, my husband suggested I use this balm. I was extremely reluctant to do so, especially given that the product has a slight scent. I was concerned the product would further irritate my sensitive skin. It didn&#x27;t. After much persistence, I tried a swatch on my neck. Not only was there not any irritation when applied, in the morning my rash was diminished in the area where I used this balm. I now use this product quite regularly. I only wish Nivea would come up with a scent-free or female friendly scented version.</li>
    <li> Excellent product .Skin friendly.</li>
    <li> Good smell and lotion is neither greasy or too dry.  My wife even likes the smell and she doesn&#x27;t like most smells.  I ordered the 3-pack which will keep me going for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern with these big company products is how many unsafe ingredients they may be ladeling in to the mix (preservatives, etc.) that we don&#x27;t know about.  I&#x27;m no granola all natural type but keep the products simple and as close to nature as possible and we&#x27;ll all live a little longer.</li>
    <li> Really soothes the skin and does not burn.  Has almost no smell to it and it gives long lasting relief. Better price than local stores,  very good deal.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> My son loves this - it is nice to order 3 at a time.  We receive it quickly and it is packed well.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling after shave I&#x27;ve ever used, and it also soothes my sensitive skin.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if you use too much of it, it can get just a little bit greasy.  If you use the right amount, though, it&#x27;s all good.  The only problem is it seems this product may be discontinued.  No retail outlet seems to carry it anymore around me, but I found it on Amazon and ordered a 3 pack.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even listed on the Nivea website.  Snatch up some of this stuff before it&#x27;s gone for good!!!</li>
