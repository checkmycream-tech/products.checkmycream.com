      <li>Best product I have found.</li>
      <li>For psoriasis, you have to use whatever works for you the best.</li>
      <li>But as acne products go it&#x27;s one of the best topicals out there.</li>
      <li>This product has been very good for the Psoriasis on my hands</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>Great to soften the skin if you have Psoriasis but</li>
      <li>This product works great.  </li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Great product - wish I could find it</li>
      <li>What is great about this Dermarest product is that it has</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>This felt good on the skin, but did nothing to improve the condition.</li>
      <li>A good over the counter product that relieves symptoms</li>
      <li>However, this is a good product - I took it to my dermatologist and she said she couldn&#x27;t prescribe anything stronger</li>
      <li>I kept touching it all day!</li>
      <li>&quot; And now I&#x27;m just so glad I did!</li>
      <li>I also wash my hands with an Amazing Minerals Salt soap about three times a day.</li>
      <li>I wish I could find a product that works this effectively and does NOT have salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>Nothing was effective.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product!!</li>
      <li>my psoriasis is so much better.</li>
      <li>I suffer from Lichen Planus for more than twenty years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this product.</li>
      <li>fast shipping, great product, would buy again</li>
      <li>Doesnt irritate more.  </li>
      <li>It works great on cystic acne especially, but if you want to use it on acne that&#x27;s whiteheads/</li>
      <li>While it doesn&#x27;t say on the product, this product actually works great for acne as it&#x27;s a 3% salicylic acid gel</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s a light gel that dries</li>
      <li>The Dermarest Eczema product really helped with that!!!</li>
      <li>I highly highly recommend it!!!!</li>
      <li>know I can eventually broke out again, but as soon as I get the first ones, I start applying the gel to prevent spread :)</li>
      <li>This product is only okay, nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>I suffer from mild psoriasis.</li>
      <li>I must add I also have mild rosacea</li>
      <li>I still find this product safer and more gentle than any benzyl peroxide treatment, but far, far more effective.</li>
      <li>It is working great--and fast too!!</li>
      <li>It leaves a smooth coating on your skin and really helps.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and the results have been great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will take a few more days, but I&#x27;m amazed.  </li>
      <li>It is the first product that has given me hope.</li>
      <li>3% salicylic acid - most acne medications only have 2%!!</li>
      <li>this stuff really works!</li>
      <li>and this is what I order it for it provides a higher concentration of it.</li>
      <li>Like many Americans at this time, I&#x27;m out of work and recently became uninsured</li>
      <li>The only thing that I can say that has worked better for me is being in the sun after spending the day at the beach with the salt water and sun.  </li>
      <li>Most other salicylic acid acne medications come in tiny tubes and cost a heck of a lot more.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this product for, over time, my psoriasis lesions decrease and finally disappear.</li>
      <li>It was soothing, but really didn&#x27;t take away any redness.</li>
      <li>Another big plus about this product is that one gets a lot of product (4oz) for a fairly cheap price.</li>
      <li>really like the consistency of this product</li>
      <li>and it really did work well for me.</li>
      <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Although this product is for psoriasis and does not mention using it for acne, the active ingredient is salicylic acid which is also the active ingredient in many, many overpriced OTC acne medications.</li>
      <li>When it breaks out, very few treatment options are effective.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend trying it if you have skin issues.</li>
      <li>I highly recommned this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very gentle, but everyone&#x27;s different</li>
      <li>Small amounts work magic.</li>
      <li>People who have less severe cases may be able to use it less frequently, but since I reapply it throughout the day I can definitely smell it all the time--slightly minty or sweet-smelling, definitely not bad, but noticeable.</li>
      <li>My skin was clear for about a year.</li>
      <li>Demarest really cleared up eczema outbreaks and scabs on back of my head and scalp.  </li>
      <li>I used up one bottle and was ready for the next and hadn&#x27;t found where to get it again.  </li>
      <li>I woke up the other morning and my facial skin felt so smooth.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years for my psoriasis problem without a final positive result.&lt;br /&gt;However, it has calmed the itching and the spreading of the illness to other parts of my body.</li>
      <li>This has been the second day using it and already my skin is starting to clear.  </li>
      <li>After a little bit, I apply my moisturizer (Cetaphil Cream) and this really works!</li>
      <li>It works great and even moisturizes you a bit, but don&#x27;t go overboard because you might flake slightly if you accidentally leave it on overnight, and you&#x27;ll flake for about a week..making putting makeup on hard.</li>
      <li>Overall, the appearance is much more manageable and a few small \\&quot;start of an outbreak\\&quot; spots have receded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> This one will last you a long time.     </li>
<li> does not totally clear up the spots, but lessens the itchy spots and the coloring.  </li>
<li> It might help dry up the whitehead and make it come to a head.</li>
<li> If your skin does get overly dry from using this, another Dermarest product (the Eczema treatment) will help with any itching and dryness.</li>
<li> However didn&#x27;t work well with second try few years later.</li>
<li> It did however, help clear up the small scaley patches I get on the sides of my nose and eyebrows (yuck).</li>
<li> The thickest scale has peeled and is now only slightly raised.</li>
<li> It will dry your skin out somewhat, but the product has other ingredients in it that seem to counteract the dryness.</li>
<li> After applying the recommended number of times daily, the skin peeled off for quite a few days.</li>
<li> The psoriasis spots aren&#x27;t as red and there are less scales!</li>
<li> You can get the product with same active ingredient(salicylic acid) for a little less at Walmart.</li>
<li> But have to use in combination with other products.</li>
<li> I like this product when used with a rotation of other psoriasis products.  </li>
<li> I definitely do like the gel feel versus the cremes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
<li> My Dad suffers from mild psoriasis and he likes this treatment.</li>
<li> dermarest, epsome salt baths, and a slight change in diet and</li>
<li> black heads</li>
<li> I would apply a little bit when I feel itchy like an outbreak is coming, and it would be prevented.</li>
<li> works within a few uses.  </li>
<li> I have been applying this to my legs before bedtime for a few nights now</li>
<li> thing I will note is that it has to be reapplied a few times.</li>
<li> I was having trouble finding this product.  </li>
<li> I developed a horrible, red, peeling, itching rash on my face that continued to persist for several weeks from using an acne product containing benzoyl peroxide.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema my whole life and recently started getting very bad psoriasis on my lower legs.  </li>
<li> I use a small amount along with Cetaphil, MK Emolient Nite Cream, Hydrocortisone or sometimes the Dermarest Psoriasis Medicated Moisturizer.  </li>
<li> My dermatologist from Mexico gave me a formula with salicylic acid and other stuff that was very difficult to remove, leaving a thick white residue (but worked).</li>
<li> If you have the thick scaly skin and have tried scrubs and all sorts of products you may want to give this a try.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This  product has helped me a lot with controlling my plaque psoriasis.  It is not a miracle drug but it seems to keep it under control</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years for my psoriasis problem without a final positive result.&lt;br /&gt;However, it has calmed the itching and the spreading of the illness to other parts of my body.</li>
    <li> While it doesn&#x27;t say on the product, this product actually works great for acne as it&#x27;s a 3% salicylic acid gel and this is what I order it for it provides a higher concentration of it. It works great and even moisturizes you a bit, but don&#x27;t go overboard because you might flake slightly if you accidentally leave it on overnight, and you&#x27;ll flake for about a week..making putting makeup on hard. So I still recommend moisturizing after it. If you wash it off after leaving it on for a bit, it won&#x27;t flake you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But as acne products go it&#x27;s one of the best topicals out there. It&#x27;s also very gentle, but everyone&#x27;s different so your mileage might vary. It works great on cystic acne especially, but if you want to use it on acne that&#x27;s whiteheads/black heads your results will be mixed. It might help dry up the whitehead and make it come to a head. After that, you can apply it however you want to help it heal faster after you get rid of the gunk. I still find this product safer and more gentle than any benzyl peroxide treatment, but far, far more effective. It even helps heal redmarks that are left over, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I like this product when used with a rotation of other psoriasis products.  Doesnt irritate more.  But have to use in combination with other products.</li>
    <li> Great to soften the skin if you have Psoriasis but&lt;br /&gt;this works wonders for acne. I use it daily and I don&#x27;t get acne break outs.</li>
    <li> Again this is a product that controls all my face shaving troubles. My face does not have the problems I get with alcohol or after shave. Thank you ole almighty Dermarest. Don&#x27;t change this product. I know you have come out with tubed creams but I beg you leave this one alone.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema my whole life and recently started getting very bad psoriasis on my lower legs.  This has been the second day using it and already my skin is starting to clear.  I&#x27;m sure it will take a few more days, but I&#x27;m amazed.  It is the first product that has given me hope.</li>
    <li> This product and the moisturizer cleared up my serrohrbic dermatitis within 2 days! All the flaking,peeling, and reddness on and around my nose was gone overnight! This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I woke up the other morning and my facial skin felt so smooth. I kept touching it all day! I realized it was because I applied this at bedtime the night before. I have sebhorreic dermatitis but actually don&#x27;t use this on my scalp. It did however, help clear up the small scaley patches I get on the sides of my nose and eyebrows (yuck). I must add I also have mild rosacea and this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also get horrible razor burn and ingrown hairs on my legs. They look like I shaved with a weed wacker. I have been applying this to my legs before bedtime for a few nights now and my legs are clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the consistency of this product - it&#x27;s a light gel that dries very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying it if you have skin issues.</li>
    <li> If you have the thick scaly skin and have tried scrubs and all sorts of products you may want to give this a try.  Your skin will peel but it does remove the bumps and the appearance of them.  The only thing that I can say that has worked better for me is being in the sun after spending the day at the beach with the salt water and sun.  However, this is a good product - I took it to my dermatologist and she said she couldn&#x27;t prescribe anything stronger so I continue to use it to reduce the appearance of the bumps.</li>
    <li> Acne sufferers listen up... Although this product is for psoriasis and does not mention using it for acne, the active ingredient is salicylic acid which is also the active ingredient in many, many overpriced OTC acne medications. What is great about this Dermarest product is that it has 3% salicylic acid - most acne medications only have 2%!! If your skin can tolerate salicylic acid alright, I would definitely give this product a try for acne. It will dry your skin out somewhat, but the product has other ingredients in it that seem to counteract the dryness. Also, I found it not to be irritating. Another big plus about this product is that one gets a lot of product (4oz) for a fairly cheap price. Most other salicylic acid acne medications come in tiny tubes and cost a heck of a lot more. This one will last you a long time.     If your skin does get overly dry from using this, another Dermarest product (the Eczema treatment) will help with any itching and dryness. That is actually how I stumbled upon Dermarest products at the local drug store. I developed a horrible, red, peeling, itching rash on my face that continued to persist for several weeks from using an acne product containing benzoyl peroxide. The Dermarest Eczema product really helped with that!!! (Now I stay away from anything containing benzoyl peroxide!)</li>
    <li> Followed the instructions without effect.&lt;br /&gt;And very difficult  to get out of the container.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you use a baseball bat.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> Outside of prescription drugs/creams, this seems to relieve some of the itching and with psoriasis that is the goal!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have a bad case of seborrheic dermatitis on my face.  When it breaks out, very few treatment options are effective.  I used to use a spray that cost $60 for one ounce.  This gel works just as well for a fraction of the price.  My outbreak was under control in 4 days.  I would apply a little bit when I feel itchy like an outbreak is coming, and it would be prevented.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and the results have been great.  I definitely do like the gel feel versus the cremes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It leaves a smooth coating on your skin and really helps.  My psoriasis on my back has reduced and anything that started on my chest has gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be my choice when my psoriasis acts up.</li>
    <li> Isuffer thickened skin in the tops of both hands .  After applying the recommended number of times daily, the skin peeled off for quite a few days.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from psoriasis on my elbows and big toes for months, I tried everything! Seems like everything I tried made it worse. I found this on line and bought it after reading Amazon reviews on it. I started using it on Monday and its about cleared up on Friday! Best product I have found. I highly highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Demarest really cleared up eczema outbreaks and scabs on back of my head and scalp.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product I used once and it really did work well for me. My skin was clear for about a year. However didn&#x27;t work well with second try few years later. I guess my skin got immune to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of topical products for psoriasis. This felt good on the skin, but did nothing to improve the condition.</li>
    <li> Works great. My Dad suffers from mild psoriasis and he likes this treatment. It calms the itching and soothes the affected skin areas. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> A good over the counter product that relieves symptoms</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years, but now can&#x27;t buy it locally.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This product is only okay, nothing spectacular. It was soothing, but really didn&#x27;t take away any redness. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works! Drink aloe juice and bath in sea salt and your psoriasis will be gone!!! Good luck!!!!!</li>
    <li> i used it with a combination of things. dermarest, epsome salt baths, and a slight change in diet and my psoriasis is so much better. Give it a shot what have you got to lose!</li>
    <li> I have chronic plaque psoriasis that covers between 75 and 80% of my body at any given time. Like many Americans at this time, I&#x27;m out of work and recently became uninsured so I must turn to over the counter treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has not miraculously cured my psoriasis, but it has helped substantially. The thickest scale has peeled and is now only slightly raised. Overall, the appearance is much more manageable and a few small \\&quot;start of an outbreak\\&quot; spots have receded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will note is that it has to be reapplied a few times. The packaged directions say between one and four times a day. People who have less severe cases may be able to use it less frequently, but since I reapply it throughout the day I can definitely smell it all the time--slightly minty or sweet-smelling, definitely not bad, but noticeable.</li>
    <li> Great product - wish I could find it locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only product that I find usefull in softening the psoriasis &#x27;scales&#x27; on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do worry about the skin / scalp thinning that is supposedly caused by prolonged use of salicylic acid - so I only use it every 4 to 6 weeks.  I wish I could find a product that works this effectively and does NOT have salicylic acid.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past but have been unable to locate.  The package arrived in a timely manner but one of the bottles was damaged so some of the gel inside leaked out.</li>
    <li> great it worked!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am using this for acne--It is working great--and fast too!! My pores are getting clearer and smaller. Thanks for a great product!!</li>
    <li> I suffer from Lichen Planus for more than twenty years. My dermatologist from Mexico gave me a formula with salicylic acid and other stuff that was very difficult to remove, leaving a thick white residue (but worked). So I look up in amazon for something similar and found this gel.&lt;br /&gt;Took some months to &#x27;cure&#x27; my condition but is gone, And there is no residues in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I know I can eventually broke out again, but as soon as I get the first ones, I start applying the gel to prevent spread :)</li>
    <li> Does not relieve the severe itching of the psoriasis on my legs.  I will not be buying this item again.</li>
    <li> works within a few uses.  does not totally clear up the spots, but lessens the itchy spots and the coloring.  would buy again</li>
    <li> You can get the product with same active ingredient(salicylic acid) for a little less at Walmart. For psoriasis, you have to use whatever works for you the best.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, great product, would buy again</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product for, over time, my psoriasis lesions decrease and finally disappear. I highly recommned this product.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding this product.  I used up one bottle and was ready for the next and hadn&#x27;t found where to get it again.  This product has been very good for the Psoriasis on my hands and I do recommend it to others.  I use a small amount along with Cetaphil, MK Emolient Nite Cream, Hydrocortisone or sometimes the Dermarest Psoriasis Medicated Moisturizer.  I also wash my hands with an Amazing Minerals Salt soap about three times a day. When regular this helps immensely.</li>
    <li> I suffer from mild psoriasis. I have some on my elbows and unfortunately, some on my face. With summer coming up, I knew that I had to find some sort of solution! I went to Walgreens and this was one of the only things that they had for psoriasis so I bought it thinking, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; And now I&#x27;m just so glad I did! I use this after dampening my skin a bit. Then, I apply some of this wherever I have it. After a little bit, I apply my moisturizer (Cetaphil Cream) and this really works! After just two days, I&#x27;m seeing results! The psoriasis spots aren&#x27;t as red and there are less scales! I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this product. If you suffer from psoriasis, then try this product! I know that psoriasis is different for everyone, but for me, this works so well! Just take the risk and see if it works out for you!
