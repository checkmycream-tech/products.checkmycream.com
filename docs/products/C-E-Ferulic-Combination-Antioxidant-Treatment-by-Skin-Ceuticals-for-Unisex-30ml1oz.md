      <li>This was recommended to me by a top LA/NYC dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll amend this review when I have more information.</li>
      <li>It is phenomenal.</li>
      <li>I do not believe this is authentic product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now been using it more than 30 days and it has changed my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still, $20.00 off is better than nothing.  </li>
      <li>and my skin keeps on getting better and better.  </li>
      <li>Does wonders to  soften lines and smooth the face!</li>
      <li>My skin is healthy and glowing, I&#x27;ve even stopped wearing foundation.  </li>
      <li>and I have pretty good skin to begin with, but this tightens it up and smooths it out.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t get cheap results.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a cheap product</li>
      <li>I called the Skinceuticals company, and the woman confirmed that there should not be a cloudy mass of gunk suspended inside the liquid.</li>
      <li>My skin is showing more brown spots then ever now, having  being off the pure formula for 6 months!  </li>
      <li>hands down my favorite serum - have been using for years with great results</li>
      <li>I am so excited about this product.  </li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me, individually, in two separate office visits,  by two of the top dermatologists in Los Angeles, CA, who are among the top authorities on skin care in the US and are more than knowledgeable on the efficacy of the latest offerings from different companies.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly and as stated.  </li>
      <li>Very recommended!!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see anything using this product... was very faithful but nothing!!</li>
      <li>I have to be honest, I have tried a lot of different skin care products, and have never seen results this quickly before.</li>
      <li>I am 50 years old now and most guess I&#x27;m in my 30s.  </li>
      <li>(The price difference was worth a try)</li>
      <li>This product is pricy ~ but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see so many glowing reviews.  </li>
      <li>The consistency and how it is absorbed into my skin</li>
      <li>I splurged and bought a bottle, while kind of expecting it to be a short lived thing.</li>
      <li>, Amazon is not an &amp;#34;authorized seller.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m going to ask for a new bottle from the supplier, but I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;ll get a free replacement.</li>
      <li>I use this twice a day for best results - remember a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I have bought this product for 20 years and this smelled funny not the real thing!</li>
      <li>I checked it out and upon 1 week of mixing a small amount into my sunscreen every morning, I was thrilled to discover the brown patches fading away, and my skin looked smooth and radiant.</li>
      <li>Ask for a sample first, if you can, before you buy.  </li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s why: when the product arrived, it was a hot day in August.</li>
      <li>My husband is finally using and is pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Have been using it daily for years and believe it&#x27;s kept my skin healthy.</li>
      <li>it can last for months and is absolutely worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>I attribute a large part of that to this item.  </li>
      <li>I use to have large pores and oily skin.</li>
      <li>The wife absolutely loves this</li>
      <li>It really does work.</li>
      <li>But I just got off the phone with a Skinceuticals representative, and I&#x27;m really regretting buying this product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have had much skin cancer on my face and much work done to remove it.  </li>
      <li>I received two very generous samples of this and have been using it every morning for about 3.5 weeks.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the laugh lines or eye lines that prove I&#x27;ve spent much of my life with a smile on my face.</li>
      <li>My OBGYN explained that this happens pretty frequently with pregnancy, told me to  wear sunscreen and they would fade.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying several vitamin c serum combos now for over a year and am pleased to report I have finally found a winner.</li>
      <li>the one I received is yellowish in color which normally happens towards the end of a bottle through the doctor.</li>
      <li>the new baby didn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>but I have a very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have been using SkinCeuticals for years, first starting with the C E Ferulic acid and then moved to Phloretin CF when it debuted.  </li>
      <li>unfortunately it is not the same as the product I get from my esthetician.</li>
      <li>Normally when I get this at the doctor it is clear...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a long-term user of C E Ferulic and look forward to trying this promising new product that&#x27;s backed up with multiple clinical trials.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought the real stuff again and hopefully will have my skin back on track soon.  </li>
      <li>I would like to know if the company got this product directly from Skin Ceuticals.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even had compliments from complete strangers.</li>
      <li>Great antioxidant, very expensive in doctors office</li>
      <li>The product was in the box for only a few minutes, and when I took it out of the box, the glass vial was warm, but not hot.</li>
      <li>Fast initial results..waiting for the long term outcome...</li>
      <li>My skin tone in general was pretty uneven, lack of sleep and stress from having</li>
      <li>You only use a few drops in the morning on dry, freshly cleansed skin.</li>
      <li>tried this product with little hope it would do much</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery of product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My husband is finally using and is pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the difference this product has made. The appearance of my skin is so much better and smoother.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for over 3 weeks and have not noticed a difference in my skin.  After hearing about and reading the great reviews I was expecting to notice something .</li>
    <li> Amazing! While on vacation in Hawaii, I went to a spa where they used Skinceuticals CF on my skin. I was amazed instantly at how awesome my skin looked that day. I splurged and bought a bottle, while kind of expecting it to be a short lived thing. That was NOT the case, three weeks later- my skin looks awesome! I also purchased the clarifying clay mask. I use to have large pores and oily skin. Now I have literally no visable pores and my skin glows!( I use the mask twice a week and mix a few drops of the CF in that, or in my moisurizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m a cheap a$$, and I will continue to buy this forever!! I look at least 5 years younger, and yes, everyone WILL notice! I no longer wear powder, which I use to need in order to balance my skin.</li>
    <li> I received two very generous samples of this and have been using it every morning for about 3.5 weeks.  I noticed no difference, so out of curiosity looked up what people thought of it.  I was surprised to see so many glowing reviews.  But as someone with nothing in it, namely over $100, I was not impressed.  Could just be my skin type though.</li>
    <li> This product is pricy ~ but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long, but do feel a change in my skin, both softer and smoother. Waiting to see results from long term use.</li>
    <li> I have been using SkinCeuticals for years, first starting with the C E Ferulic acid and then moved to Phloretin CF when it debuted.  I am 50 years old now and most guess I&#x27;m in my 30s.  I attribute a large part of that to this item.  It says it&#x27;s a preventive serum but I believe it&#x27;s also a corrective serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds and brands of this, and nothing is as good as this brand.  Expensive, but it does last a long time. I&#x27;ll keep using it and ordering it.</li>
    <li> I have searched for something to help my dry sun damaged skin. I&#x27;m 65 and aging has been something I have no problem with except my skin looks sick. I don&#x27;t mind the laugh lines or eye lines that prove I&#x27;ve spent much of my life with a smile on my face. I do mind the uneven tone and texture and the rough patches and anything that just looks like I&#x27;m sick not just aging.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product with little hope it would do much but I was wrong. The 2nd day my skin looked brighter and less stressed. I&#x27;ve now been using it more than 30 days and it has changed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The texture, tone, brightness and yes even my wrinkles have been transformed. This isn&#x27;t a cheap product but you don&#x27;t get cheap results. I will continue to use this product for as long as I can afford.</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks.  My skin is healthy and glowing, I&#x27;ve even stopped wearing foundation.  I noticed a difference within a few days.  People started asking me how I&#x27;d gotten tan in the middle of winter because the dullness had gone from my skin.  I&#x27;ve even had compliments from complete strangers. I can&#x27;t imagine not using this product everyday.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a top LA/NYC dermatologist.  It&#x27;s supposed to help prevent cell damage due to \\&quot;environmental attack.\\&quot;  You only use a few drops in the morning on dry, freshly cleansed skin.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my facialist, this is a great product. It is a staple for me and gives a brightness to the skin in addition to protection</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying several vitamin c serum combos now for over a year and am pleased to report I have finally found a winner. The consistency and how it is absorbed into my skin I have not experienced with any other serums thusfar. I will definitely post an update in 6 weeks&#x27; time</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Good results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-term user of C E Ferulic and look forward to trying this promising new product that&#x27;s backed up with multiple clinical trials.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.  It both clogged my pores and dried out my skin.  The smell of it is awful.  Also, I was unable to return to the Amazon vendor, because it was used, and SkinCeuticals wouldn&#x27;t offer a return because I didn&#x27;t buy directly from them.  Ask for a sample first, if you can, before you buy.  I wish I had.</li>
    <li> been using for years and it is a game changer for skin.  don&#x27;t let the price dissuade you.  you only need to use it 1x per day and just 2 or three drops.  it can last for months and is absolutely worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>
    <li> I question the authenticity of this product. It has a very different appearance from my previous bottle of C E Ferulic that I got directly from Loreal. It makes me wonder.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years--dermatologist recommended to help prevent damage from sun --- a must have here in sunny Florida.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me, individually, in two separate office visits,  by two of the top dermatologists in Los Angeles, CA, who are among the top authorities on skin care in the US and are more than knowledgeable on the efficacy of the latest offerings from different companies. I noticed an immediate improvement in the texture of my skin, and the product helped soothe the redness of my cheeks. Excellent so far.</li>
    <li> Great product. Amazing price.</li>
    <li> After application ,skin became oily</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist/surgeon following removal of a skin cancer on my face.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it is a great product to keep skin protected and balanced.  I follow application with the hydrating B5 gel.  I have confidence in the Skin Ceutical brand after using their products for several years.</li>
    <li> I would like to know if the company got this product directly from Skin Ceuticals.  Unless they changed the formula, the texture seems greasier and does not tingle on application like it did before.  Perhaps Skin Ceuticals changed their formula.  Does not feel the same.</li>
    <li> The wife absolutely loves this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s effective and I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle &amp; opened it immediately.  It was much clearer &amp; not as thick as the one I bought from a licensed esthetician. It seems as if it has been watered down. The company could have opened the bottles &amp; then resealed it with similar plastic.  I am going to return it.  Not very happy to see what I have seen.</li>
    <li> Very recommended!! Fast initial results..waiting for the long term outcome...</li>
    <li> Have been using it daily for years and believe it&#x27;s kept my skin healthy. Turned my daughter on to it too.</li>
    <li> Its very good products and i give it to my wife</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years in conjunction with the Obagi NuDerm system as well as Retin A and my skin keeps on getting better and better.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without this product.  It is phenomenal.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product and very good treatment to prevent wrinckles and specially leave the skin moisturized during the night.</li>
    <li> I bought this after the recommendation of my aesthetician. It really does work. I&#x27;m 62 and I have pretty good skin to begin with, but this tightens it up and smooths it out. I&#x27;ve started dabbing a few drops on my neck and it makes a difference there too. It&#x27;s quite amazing. It now replaces an entire drawer of other cosmetics. It&#x27;s not as expensive as it seems since you only need a few drops at a time to smear around your face -- and of course now I don&#x27;t have to buy the other stuff that sits in the drawers.  Also recommend the concentrated hyaluronic (sp?). Not sure who makes it but it&#x27;s on Amazon. (I&#x27;m the wife of the buyer.)</li>
    <li> A mainstay in my regimen, as recommended by my plastic surgeon. Very effective - amazon has the best prices.</li>
    <li> Good product, but I have a very sensitive skin so it is often irritated and itchy for couple minute. Definitely you should try it out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for YEARS and it WORKS! However, the last two Bottles I have ordered from this vendor on Amazon. (The price difference was worth a try) unfortunately it is not the same as the product I get from my esthetician. It appears to be watered down with something.  My skin is showing more brown spots then ever now, having  being off the pure formula for 6 months!  I&#x27;ve bought the real stuff again and hopefully will have my skin back on track soon.  I feel bad for skinceuticals. Products being tampered with affects their potential client base!</li>
    <li> I sold Skinceuticals for awhile........this product is great, however.......the list price from Skinceuticals, itself is $146.00..........NOT what they have listed.  Still, $20.00 off is better than nothing.  You can find it cheaper elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My mother (a cancer survivor) uses this product and recommended it to me. I was happy to invest $100 if it helps my skin. But I just got off the phone with a Skinceuticals representative, and I&#x27;m really regretting buying this product on Amazon. Here&#x27;s why: when the product arrived, it was a hot day in August. The product was in the box for only a few minutes, and when I took it out of the box, the glass vial was warm, but not hot. I opened the bottle and squeezed a few dabs of the oil on my skin and afterward noticed a jelly-fish-like cloud suspended in the dropper as I squeezed the bulb. When I released my squeeze, of course the little cloud of I-don&#x27;t-know-what sucked back into the bulb. Frankly, I was grossed out. I unscrewed the bulb and washed out the bulb thoroughly, then re-attached it. But I know that somehow the liquid had become contaminated and grew some sort of bacteria. I called the Skinceuticals company, and the woman confirmed that there should not be a cloudy mass of gunk suspended inside the liquid. Now I have a $100 bottle of C E Ferulic that isn&#x27;t warranted by Skinceuticals because, I&#x27;ve just found out, Amazon is not an &amp;#34;authorized seller.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m going to ask for a new bottle from the supplier, but I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;ll get a free replacement. I&#x27;ll amend this review when I have more information.</li>
    <li> Truly good for your skin</li>
    <li> hands down my favorite serum - have been using for years with great results</li>
    <li> Great antioxidant, very expensive in doctors office, Amazon cost; excellent.</li>
    <li> This product definitely helps remove sun damage and prevent additional brown spots. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I am 35 and had a baby last year,  during and after my pregnancy, I noticed an increase in \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; around my forehead, and mouth. My OBGYN explained that this happens pretty frequently with pregnancy, told me to  wear sunscreen and they would fade. Well, they never did. My skin tone in general was pretty uneven, lack of sleep and stress from having the new baby didn&#x27;t help. I heard so many great things about this product I checked it out and upon 1 week of mixing a small amount into my sunscreen every morning, I was thrilled to discover the brown patches fading away, and my skin looked smooth and radiant. I have to be honest, I have tried a lot of different skin care products, and have never seen results this quickly before.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Got a great $ on Amazon. My skin has never looked better. I use this twice a day for best results - remember a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and highly recommended by my dermatologist.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past year at the request of my dermatologist.  I have had much skin cancer on my face and much work done to remove it.  I have noticed less recurrence of AKs since using this product.  I save $55 by buying this product on line instead of the MDs office.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Does wonders to  soften lines and smooth the face!</li>
    <li> My favorite go-to item!</li>
    <li> This is a must product for all skin types!</li>
    <li> Normally when I get this at the doctor it is clear...the one I received is yellowish in color which normally happens towards the end of a bottle through the doctor. Hope it&#x27;s still good.Probably won&#x27;t order again through this company</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see anything using this product... was very faithful but nothing!!</li>
    <li> This bottle of C E Ferrulic Combination Antioxidant Treatment solution has been diluted.  The color is lighter in color and the viscosity is different, a lot thinner fluid.  Did SiknCeuticals diluted their solution? or is this a repackaged product by the reseller?</li>
    <li> I have used this fantastic product for years!</li>
    <li> Everyone should be using this product. It is amazing on your skin.</li>
    <li> Have ordered this before from same vendor.  Delivered quickly and as stated.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I do not believe this is authentic product. I knew the price was too good to be true. I have bought this product for 20 years and this smelled funny not the real thing!</li>
