      <li>Everything ok!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>My husband claims this is the best thing he has found to heal the bleeding and scratches from shaving with a straight razor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremel;y effective</li>
      <li>In all cases it&#x27;s about 1/5th as effective as a styptic pencil.</li>
      <li>since we ordered it from Amazon, it would be nice to know what the the packaging reads.</li>
      <li>Effective, but there are cheaper options out there that are just as effective.</li>
      <li>Proraso is a great line of shaving products and this is the perfect solution to minor cuts incurred while shaving.</li>
      <li>Pretty good stuff!  </li>
      <li>Your best friend, probably not, but if it gets you out the door and to that big meeting on time, well you will be glad you had this in your shaving kit!</li>
      <li>When I apply this, I don&#x27;t get a real noticeable burning sensation, so I guess that&#x27;s good for everybody!</li>
      <li>Great for first time safety razor users.</li>
      <li>This gel works great and fast!</li>
      <li>This is a great product, stops bleeding fast and doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
      <li>Much better than a styptic pencil.</li>
      <li>Nicks and cuts are a fact of life for most shavers.  </li>
      <li>So much better than the stipic pencil.</li>
      <li>Works on most razor cuts.  </li>
      <li>It works better than the stick.</li>
      <li>Give it a try, I am sure you will like it.</li>
      <li>It works better than the styptic pencils I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>Alum is better.  </li>
      <li>Looking for better options.</li>
      <li>It takes many many washes to get the stuff off.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s much better than the sticks you get from the drug store.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you apply it after your post-shave treatment or you may end up with a sticky post-shave.</li>
      <li>I have found alum works much better.</li>
      <li>Better than a stick.  </li>
      <li>works better then any nick/cut sealer that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This is way better than a styptic pencil, with a styptic it burns a lot.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a styptic gel that works great and dries clear!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t nick myself while shaving very often, but when I do there is a good chance I am in hurry to get out the door for something important.  </li>
      <li>I liked very much.</li>
      <li>Well maybe not your best friend, but it can certainly save the day, or morning actually.  </li>
      <li>Great alternative to a razor pencil and doesn&#x27;t leave a visual residue on your face.</li>
      <li>Its nice and viscous and forms almost a goopy layer on the cut and stops the bleeding fast.</li>
      <li>Natural ingredients and good scent.</li>
      <li>It is an old and proven design for good reason but should be used after gaining some experience.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this for shaving nicks.</li>
      <li>Worked ok the first couple times i used it.  </li>
      <li>As soon as I&#x27;m cut in any way, I clean it, put antibiotic on it, then apply this styptic gel.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply and washes right off.</li>
      <li>May be ok in certain applications, but not for me.</li>
      <li>Once the cut has stopped bleeding and fullly clotted, you need to rinse this</li>
      <li>Works fairly well, but not as well as regular liquid or powder styptic.  </li>
      <li>It takes more than you would expect to really stop the flow.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as regular styptic pencils.  </li>
      <li>stuff stops the bleeding quick.</li>
      <li>This produce will stop bleeding quickly and create a &amp;#34;sealant&amp;#34; over the spot.</li>
      <li>Luckily I don&#x27;t use this often, but when I do cut myself, this makes quick use of the repair.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Otherwise you&#x27;ll look like there&#x27;s a spot of super glue on your cheek, no odor.</li>
      <li>I took out the styptic pencil and it stopped quickly.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the old styptic pencils!!</li>
      <li>I rarely  use it as I get a great shave using other Proraso products.</li>
      <li>Does not do that good of a job in stopping bleeding from minor cuts while shaving.  </li>
      <li>It does what its supposed to, although I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s pretty rare that you have a wound that a cheap alum block won&#x27;t close up.</li>
      <li>Unlike most other styptic products, this one does not burn and because it is a gel, it is very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that after the gel dries its best to wipe it off with a damp cloth otherwise it will dry and flake or powder.</li>
      <li>This gel works great for heavy shaving bleeds.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works very well as do all Proraso products that I used, shaving creams, pre-shave and after shave lotions, etc.</li>
    <li> Maybe I am using it wrong, but it did not do anything it was supposed to.  It is obvious you have something applied to your face, this product is not invisible.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Prorazo shave cream, but this gel for closing up cuts that are incurred while shaving is not up to Prorazo quality. Compared to a regular styptic pencil, this gel does not stop bleeding nearly as well and leaves a harder-to-remove white residue on your skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! I am new to wet shaving, got a little cocky, and nicked the base of my nostril. Instant bloody mess!. This immediately covered the nicked skin like glue and stopped the bleeding, allowing it to start healing. Can&#x27;t imagine any other product working better. Will definitely keep a tube on hand from now on. And be more careful with the unforgiving razor blade!</li>
    <li> This product does a great job on stopping bleeding from small nicks and cuts.  The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t dry clear or should I say clear enough.  So I find myself having to wash it off once it does its job of stopping the blood.</li>
    <li> This seems to work okay.  Not a lot to say other than it seems to stop the small nicks I get sometimes while shaving.  I haven&#x27;t tested it on a bigger cut, and I hope I never have to!  When I apply this, I don&#x27;t get a real noticeable burning sensation, so I guess that&#x27;s good for everybody!</li>
    <li> This works, but you have to pretty much cover the entire wound with gel.  It isn&#x27;t as simple as just putting a dab on and waiting.  I have found alum works much better.</li>
    <li> This product is a very good alternative to the styptic pencil.  It takes very little to stop the bleeding and as advertised it leaves no residue.  Also, it did not sting which was unexpected.  Proraso is a great line of shaving products and this is the perfect solution to minor cuts incurred while shaving.</li>
    <li> It does the job great. But it as it dries, it turns into an awful looking crusty mess. It looks like you have a dry skin problem. Definitely not buying it again.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product for someone looking for a non stinging non hospital smelling styptic solution. If you have a deep or heavy cut a traditional styptic liquid or pen make works best to close and seal the cut. If you have a small or minor cut this gel works well and doesn&#x27;t sting or smell like a hospital emergency room. Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that after the gel dries its best to wipe it off with a damp cloth otherwise it will dry and flake or powder. Not the best option if you&#x27;re headed into a meeting or dinner ;)</li>
    <li> I usually use the crayon-like styptic pencils of yore, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back after using this.  It&#x27;s quick, easy to use, pretty much odorless and stops up anything other than a major nick.  Should you properly butcher your face with a straight-edge, this will probably be a bit less than is needed.</li>
    <li> concept sounded great . but this did not work as well as i thought it was going to . I got a couple small weepers from de shaving and this stuff didn&#x27;t really do much to stop the bleeding at all . I took out the styptic pencil and it stopped quickly.  I love the other proraso products but this was a let down.</li>
    <li> The first (and only) Proraso product that disappointed. The tube seemed short-filled. After squeezing to get product out, it was only half-full. The gel stopped minor nicks but for larger cuts, I went back to a trusted, but messy, styptic pencil. The Proraso gel is NOT recommended.</li>
    <li> Easier to use than the old styptic pencils of the past. No white residue and fast acting.</li>
    <li> It has helped me heal up with those nicks from shaving and no more toilet paper on my face at work!</li>
    <li> It does the job. Stops bleeding on contact. Just a little dot of the stuff is all it takes.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the old styptic sticks that leave a white residue. The first few times I used my old-fashioned wet razor I really needed this gel. Now only occasionally.</li>
    <li> I frequently cut myself shaving, so my boyfriend ordered this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not work. You have to have the cut almost completely stopped (bleeding) before it even remotely works, so what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> I bought another styptic type product and was disappointed.  I decided to try this because I have been satisfied with other Proraso products.  I really like it. It cost about 10 times as much as a styptic pencil but works so much better on larger nicks or cut that it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;* This works very well with both larger and small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;* Tube is small enough that it can fit in your travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;* The opening clogs fairly easily, and you have to open it with a pin or similar object.&lt;br /&gt;* It leaves a visible clear residue, and in some cases a white crust.  Once the cut has stopped bleeding and fullly clotted, you need to rinse this off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite a few minor gripes I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and can recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like a close shave and use a double edge safety razor with the sharpest blades that I can buy (usually Feather or Personna surgical).  Even with good technique, nicks and cuts do happen.  I&#x27;ve typically used a Clubman styptic pencil.  They work well, but can be a bit messy and leave a white residue on your skin.  I purchased the Proraso styptic gel, basically because I have found all their products to be excellent and a good value.  Since receiving it, I&#x27;ve had a couple of ocassions to use the gel, and it works perfectly!  Toss the styptic pencil.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This gel works great for heavy shaving bleeds.  It stops the bleeding and leaves the area with a distinctive colorless film.  Unfortunately it has a strong menthol smell, almost like Ben-Gay, YUK!!!&lt;br /&gt;For everyday nicks and small cuts I suggest using an alum block; its cheaper, works well, and has no odor.</li>
    <li> Does not do that good of a job in stopping bleeding from minor cuts while shaving.  Expected more, got less. Save your money, try something else.</li>
    <li> This stuff works as advertised. It stops the bleeding and it doesn&#x27;t sting. However, it does leave a white spot on your face when it dries. However, after an hour or so you can wipe it off and the cut still won&#x27;t bleed. This price is too high but I would still buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year now and am very satisfied with how well it works.  Unlike most other styptic products, this one does not burn and because it is a gel, it is very easy to apply.  I actually bought this along with the Pre Shave and Shave Cream as a Christmas Gift for my Nephew.  Give it a try, I am sure you will like it.</li>
    <li> Works poorly, very unlike other Proraso products.  Alum is better.  Looking for better options.</li>
    <li> The Proraso Repair Gel For Men is used for razor blade cuts and nicks when shaving it stops the bleeding and heals&lt;br /&gt;the skin it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I found the product to be as advertised.  I will purchase again and will recommend to others that I know would be interested.</li>
    <li> Works great on nicks and cuts from shaving.</li>
    <li> This will last forever and will stop bleeding almost instantly. My only complaint is that after it dries it leaves a plastic-y feeling on my face. You cannot use other products on top of this, so use it to stop the bleeding, and then rinse off before putting on moisturizers or sun screen.</li>
    <li> Too gloppy for my taste and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as fast or as well as a syptic stick.</li>
    <li> Good to use and stops bleeding instantly, however, must be used on DRY SKIN ONLY.  Does not work on wet skin.  If you are familiar with &amp;#34;NEW SKIN&amp;#34; it works using same principle.</li>
    <li> I was shaving with my Edwin Jagger DE89, and completely forgotten that i had a pimple and got a cut from it. It was bleeding pretty bad, so i used this product and stopped the bleeding &#x3D;] it is a clear gel so it doesn&#x27;t show on your skin as much; however be warn that if you apply too much, you will see white crust around your skin.</li>
    <li> For those who nick themselves shaving, forget about toilet paper all over your neck. Get a tube of this stuff and stop the bleeding. Just a little on your finger tip dabbed at the cut and the bleeding stops. Let it dry, give the nick time to heal, then wipe off any residue with a soft wash cloth. If the nick is small enough, just a tiny dot is enough, and it won&#x27;t show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews below complain about a white residue showing up. If you use a lot of the gel, yes, this happens. use a little and it won&#x27;t. Finish the job with some [[ASIN:B001N9MJX8 Proraso Dioibarba Aftershave Lotion (Liquid) 100ml/3.4oz]] or [[ASIN:B000RIAD0W Proraso Pre and Post Shave Cream - 3.6 oz]] and you&#x27;re ready to face the world. Go get &#x27;em, tiger!</li>
    <li> I use the entire line of proraso. Though I so do not use much of this particular product the time that I have used it works very well</li>
    <li> It worked when I first got it but after I had it for a couple of months the stuff dried up inside the tube keeping it from squeezing out. Had to throw it away. Stay with the sticks.</li>
    <li> works better then any nick/cut sealer that I have ever used. Forget septic pens and toilette paper. This stuff only requires a small amount to seal cuts and stop bleeding.</li>
    <li> It is not recommended for those just returning to or starting to wet shave with a double edge safety razor. It is an old and proven design for good reason but should be used after gaining some experience. It is a well made razor and has a place in DE shavers collection and will remain and be used in mine.&lt;br /&gt;HJS in PA</li>
    <li> Nicked myself pretty good and a very very small amount of the product cleared up the bleeder quite nicely, I definitely recommend it, would be nice if they would change the tube to have an applicator, but it works exactly as it should as is</li>
    <li> Worked ok the first couple times i used it.  Have kept it tightly sealed.  Went to use it this morning again after nicking myself and it was as hard as a rock.  Even driving a toothpick to try and clear the hole did not work.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff!  It doesn&#x27;t sting and stops the bleeding pretty fast.  For me, it still leaves a scab so thats why I went with 4 stars.  The styptic pencil didn&#x27;t leave a scab but it stings.</li>
    <li> This product comes without instructions and does not seem to perform very well.  Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This styptic, applied in a gel, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do: stop bleeding the bleeding from nicks instantly. It&#x27;s extremel;y effective and I&#x27;m sure the tube I have will last for quite a while, but the price seems a little steep.</li>
    <li> I just started wet shaving a year ago and needless to say i cut myself a lot (used to anyways).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff stops the bleeding quick. Its nice and viscous and forms almost a goopy layer on the cut and stops the bleeding fast. That&#x27;s why i think it works better than a bloc of alum on a specific cut. AND you can lather up the spot without your lather disappearing like with alum blocs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tube will last you a long time. Also works great on any other type of small cuts or abrasions.</li>
    <li> Closes nicks on contact without the harshness or sting of regular styptic pencils. Disappears but still works when lotion is applied over it.</li>
    <li> My husband claims this is the best thing he has found to heal the bleeding and scratches from shaving with a straight razor. When the cat or dog try to help him shave, this is the product he grabs to save his face! He has very sensitive skin, but has never had a rash or dry-spots after using Proraso.</li>
    <li> Stops the bleeding from shaving Knicks. Much better than a styptic pencil. Product arrived quickly. Only complaint is there are no directions in English, not a big thing just annoying.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he says it works as stated, leaves a bit of a white residue but definetely stops any any bleeding. Just wait a few minutes and put some face lotion on and all set to go!</li>
    <li> Your face needs to be dry for this stuff to actually work. So, when you get out of the shower, shave, start bleeding, when you apply this its too damp you actually have to use it with a dry face in a dry room or else it wont seal the cut and it will just keep bleeding... Also it is written only in Italian. So, if you are trying to figure out how to use it, check online.</li>
    <li> Stops bleeding quickly and leaves a clear paste.  A great product.</li>
    <li> It works well but it&#x27;s very expensive and difficult to get all the gel out of the tube. I also found that the gel got very dried out and tough to get out of the tube when it was about half full. I think a metal tube wouldn&#x27;t have this problem since it would not fill back up with air after use. I&#x27;ll stick with the pencils.</li>
    <li> What?  Well maybe not your best friend, but it can certainly save the day, or morning actually.  I don&#x27;t nick myself while shaving very often, but when I do there is a good chance I am in hurry to get out the door for something important.  At least important enough that I don&#x27;t want to walk in with toilet paper stuck to my bleeding neck, or a blood stained collar.  The gel is amazing at stopping the bleeding (styptic) and it also forms a thin clear seal over the nick just to make sure that you can put your shirt on with the confidence that the nick is not going to continue bleeding.  Your best friend, probably not, but if it gets you out the door and to that big meeting on time, well you will be glad you had this in your shaving kit!</li>
    <li> yep , this thing works just as advertised, now that i have switched to safety razor shaving , I needed this as I go through this learning curve.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works like a charm and seals up cuts and nicks instantly (and I do mean instantly). Buy some and keep with your shaving gear...</li>
    <li> Effective, but there are cheaper options out there that are just as effective.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to get out of the tube.. feels like its half empty. Also doesn&#x27;t stop the bleeding and leaves a very sticky residue...Also the packaging is entirely in Italian.  Obviously we know whats inside since we ordered it from Amazon, it would be nice to know what the the packaging reads.</li>
    <li> Stops shaving cut bleeds pretty quickly.On smaller cuts it doesn&#x27;t burn as much as some of the other reviewers have said.&lt;br /&gt;Just a little dab of this is all I&#x27;ve needed to do the job,After a few minutes i rinse it off with some cold water and i&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> The product came to me dried out, rock solid.  It was ruined because the cap wasn&#x27;t screwed down on the tube and the product inside was compromised.  I did get a refund, and have it on my watch list to give it another shot.</li>
    <li> Always searching for that best product. I have tried so many it is hard to keep track. I can just explain that this is all you will ever need for razor cuts. Done deal this is similar but not a liquid band aid. It is sticky and does not sting but stops bleeding immediately.</li>
    <li> This product does NOT quickly stop bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;Over time - about a year for me - the gel solidifies in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Try a styptic pencil instead. It works better than Proraso Gel and will last much longer.</li>
    <li> Works Great I am new to Wet Shaving and Need This.  BUT BE WARNED IT BURNS LIKE FIRE. LOL</li>
    <li> Works fairly well, but not as well as regular liquid or powder styptic.  On the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t sting at all when applied to a nick.</li>
    <li> This gel is way easier to use than a styptic pencil or stick. Anyone who values a good shave collection should have this in it.</li>
    <li> Great for first time safety razor users. It instantly stop cuts and nicks. Add it to your safety razor kit bag.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Stop bleeding instantly!</li>
    <li> Bought it to go with my proraso collection. It requires a lot of product to stop bleed and takes too long a time to dry and looks crusty and when it is.</li>
    <li> it works well enough but needs to be wiped off after it kinda crusts-over. Otherwise you&#x27;ll look like there&#x27;s a spot of super glue on your cheek, no odor. And one tube will likely last a decade.</li>
    <li> Just the smallest dab stops nicks dead - the only issue I found is that it tends to flow out f the tube faster that needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent styptic that&#x27;s much better than the sticks you get from the drug store. Proraso is a name you can trust.</li>
    <li> Luckily I don&#x27;t use this often, but when I do cut myself, this makes quick use of the repair. Make sure you apply it after your post-shave treatment or you may end up with a sticky post-shave.</li>
    <li> Better than a stick.  A little dab of gel spreads and stops bleeding right away.  A lot easier to apply than a dry stick scrapping across the skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve luckily only had to use it once (well, two places during one shave) since I&#x27;ve switched to wet shaving, but it stopped the blood flow quickly. The only issue is it seems to congeal into a little nasty bulb you pick off once solidified... but what else is it going to do? Pretty much that! ;)</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel, other than the initial sing at application a must for wet shave men.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to, although I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s pretty rare that you have a wound that a cheap alum block won&#x27;t close up.</li>
    <li> Nicks and cuts are a fact of life for most shavers.  Styptic pencils can be a real mess, and other nick repair products are too expensive for how much you get.  This product is a great repair tool at a great price.  It stops even the worst cut almost automatically and it dries clear.</li>
    <li> This gel works great and fast! I pref it over a styptic pencil. some say that it does not sting at all, but with my experience it *does* still sting a little, not as bad as when using a pencil though.</li>
    <li> Not much to say.  It&#x27;s a styptic gel that works great and dries clear!  it does leave a bit of a film/surface, but I guess that&#x27;s the intended affect (haven&#x27;t used styptics before).</li>
    <li> When my husband nicks himself, he really bleeds, so we are trying this. Of course now that we have it, no nicks so far. Probably because he uses the rest of the Proraso line. Second review  now that he has used it. He says it&#x27;s horrible. Though it doesn&#x27;t leave a white mark, it is sticky and dries like super glue. It takes many many washes to get the stuff off. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be applied with a toothpick.</li>
    <li> Okay, I know the theory is that you avoid cutting yourself while shaving. However, I am obsessed with shaving, love it, look forward to it, and shave most every day with a straight razor of one sort or another. Occasionally I slip and try to open up my adams apple or cheek. Little dab of this stops the bleeding in a couple of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fragrance that I can detect, feels a little sticky, and will leave a little shiny circle on your face if you don&#x27;t rinse it off or put some aftershave balm over it. Bottom line, it stops the bleeding faster than styptic pencils or alum blocks, and is much more convenient to use since you don&#x27;t have to dry it off and clean up the white residue from wherever the pencil was sitting. Will probably outlast a half dozen styptic pencils to boot, will be cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> The stuff works great. No more blood cuts.  It&#x27;s a. Life saver. For cuts nicks.  I need to order. A case</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for shaving nicks. However, once I got a kitten, I ended up with kitten bites and scratches. As soon as I&#x27;m cut in any way, I clean it, put antibiotic on it, then apply this styptic gel. It works better than the styptic pencils I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s easy to apply and washes right off.</li>
    <li> No more toilet paper face.  Years ago I had a &amp;#34;styptic pencil&amp;#34; that was given me (care package - otherwise odd gift right?)and it left white residue on my face.  This leaves not residue, it simply stops the bleeding from my dull razor scraping my face.  It doesn&#x27;t take much either, just a small dab and smear it on.</li>
    <li> Listen, just like all Proraso products, this does smell REALLY GOOD.  But for the times that I have nicked myself with my cut throat, when I&#x27;ve applied this stuff, it just stays on white, rather than clear.  And, although it comes out as a gel, it dries with a bit of a gritty texture that I don&#x27;t quite like.  The main downfall of this is that if you cover your nicks with it, it&#x27;s basically just a gritty, white coating.  Why would anyone want that?  I&#x27;ve found myself just using standard lotion to rub into my face after I nick and that soothes my skin much better.  I thought about giving this two stars because the scent is really good, but I have to be honest that I find this product worthless for my own shaving purposes.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Basically acts as a second skin. Apply a very small amount to the cut or razor burn. This produce will stop bleeding quickly and create a &amp;#34;sealant&amp;#34; over the spot. Only a small amount is necessary. After a few minutes, I was able to wipe this product away with a damp face towel without having the bleeding restart. Much fast than using a styptic pencil.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this stuff, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well. I tried every combination of use -- keeping it on the skin for a few seconds, a minute, several minutes, using a lot, using a little. In all cases it&#x27;s about 1/5th as effective as a styptic pencil. It&#x27;s really hard to rinse it off without disturbing the wound again. And if you don&#x27;t rinse it off thoroughly or at all, it leaves a sticky film which then cracks and turns white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m not using it properly? Maybe if I used a very small accurate amount, then rinsed it off gently 30 seconds later, it would work perfectly? If so they should have included some english documentation with illustrations explaining this. In any case it&#x27;s too much work and has no advantage over a pencil.</li>
    <li> excellent product, great service. Different approach than the chalky styptic pencil and alum.</li>
    <li> Great, better than a pen.</li>
    <li> I nicked myself while shaving and I just grabbed this Styptic Gel and tried it out stopped the bleeding and did not feel a sting.  Felt that it closed the bump and bleeding stopped.</li>
    <li> This does just what you want it to but I have to add a few things. It takes more than you would expect to really stop the flow. I use a very sharp DE blade and if there is any bump of any kind on my face, it levels it - with the blood flow to follow. This is a good product but as it does its thing, it leaves a very dark &amp;#34;scab&amp;#34; from the clotted blood and also &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; the skin around it as it does its drying. That part I don&#x27;t like so much I avoid using this unless I have a real blood letting going on - which happens every could of weeks. Overall, it is better than dabbing with toilet paper or getting blood all over your towel.</li>
    <li> Proraso styptic gels works. I rarely  use it as I get a great shave using other Proraso products. Nonetheless, the occasional nicks and cuts are quickly taken are of with the styptic gel.</li>
    <li> Ok for a tiny nick but does not work as well as a styptic pencil or powder. I guess it stings a little less but it doesn&#x27;t stop the bleeding like it suggests</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful in stopping those weepers you get when wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;When you shave you will almost always get a small bleeding weeper, so&lt;br /&gt;At first you try your alum block which will stop the smallest weepers, but&lt;br /&gt;For those pesky weepers you put a dab of this gel on an bam..no more weeping.</li>
    <li> Never used this before but it&#x27;s great. Totally recommended.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed in the performance of the gel. May be ok in certain applications, but not for me.I&#x27;ll stick to the powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the Safty razor and thought I needed somthing to stop the bleeding.  And this product did stop the bleeding with hardly any sting.</li>
    <li> I use a safety razor with a double edge blade. I don&#x27;t usually cut myself when shaving. Those times when I change blade brands or if I don&#x27;t properly prep my face for a shave I usually do. When I get a cut, I use styptic pencil and have to hold the pencil on the cut for about 1 minute. Takes too long. I saw this on Amazon and had to try it. I just got it a few days ago and sadly, I cut myself this morning. The instructions are in Italian but with a small amount of the get on the cut, I left it alone and forgot about it. By the time I was in my car and ready to leave my driveway, I noticed, looking on my rear view mirror, that the gel has dried up and did its job. It is a small tube but I&#x27;m sure it will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Seems that first off, some other reviews were mentioning that this turns white - which is true.  Also, didn&#x27;t really stop much of the bleeding in any faster time period than what I would have thought would have stopped naturally.</li>
    <li> Wayyyyy better than the old pencil.  It actually works and with  small dab.  Proraso has great products.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Bought it at the same time as I bought my first safety razor.  Thankfully, I&#x27;ve only got a couple nicks that required the gel, but it was a quick and easy way to stem the bleeding.</li>
    <li> This is a somewhat pricey item that turned out to be a great disappointment. It does not work noticeably better than any of the alternatives (a simple alum block is a useful and usually economical  choice), and in my case at least, the product has one serious drawback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the third or fourth use, I began to notice that the gel was increasingly difficult to squeeze out of the small opening at the end of the tube. The gel had dried out and closed up the opening, despite the fact that I had kept the tube tightly sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first attempt at a fix for this was to poke the hole with a straight pin to loosen the congealed gel. This, and subsequent pokings with larger objects didn&#x27;t do much good, so I eventually wound up putting a little hole at the end of the tube and covering that with scotch tape when done. The entire center of the product is now thoroughly congealed and unusable. Hardly a satisfactory solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps mine was old stock, or perhaps this is just something that is endemic to the product. Either way, there&#x27;s no way to justify the sort of thing. I won&#x27;t be coming back to Prorosso products anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this product, but it doesn&#x27;t stop bleeding very well.</li>
    <li> Works very well to stop small nicks without any stinging. Just follow directions. Perfect sizer for travel.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Just use a small film on your finger against a cut and bleeding stops. Natural ingredients and good scent. Great alternative to a razor pencil and doesn&#x27;t leave a visual residue on your face.</li>
    <li> Ever nick that face or those legs? Well if you have a knack for getting nicked this stuff is for you. A drop and I mean a drop will stop a nasty nick in instantly. No more TP on the face to stop a bleeder. It does sting just a tad at first but it works so well. I will always keep a tube of this around. It may seem pricey for such a small tube but when I say a drop is all you need I mean it. Unless you carve that canned ham you call a face up everyday this tube should last for years.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as a styptic pencil.  Works on most razor cuts.  Still need a styptic pencil for the worse razor cuts.  I would hold off on this if you are new to DE or straight razor shaving until you are proficient and stop getting the deeper nicks.</li>
    <li> Works like liquid bandage.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as regular styptic pencils.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much, but it doesn&#x27;t stop the bleeding, it acts as a covering.  Leaves a sticky and white residue on my skin which eventually flakes off.</li>
    <li> Requires only a dab to do the job. I will definitely purchase this product again when needed, but very very little goes a VERY LONG WAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish doctors would carry this for after they draw blood.</li>
    <li> Works great to fix those nicks and cuts.  Prompt delivery from seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and am hooked on it. It&#x27;s a staple of a good wet shave kit or for any shaving regimen. I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation from using this product, in the contrary it soothes any irritation from shaving. This is way better than a styptic pencil, with a styptic it burns a lot. Also about half of the time with a styptic pencil wont properly seal the cut and you end up bleeding still with a giant white blob around the cut from reapplying so much. This gel form however is great, it doesn&#x27;t burn at all when applied to a cut. It&#x27;s kind of thick when rubbed on so you only need one application to seal the cut and stop bleeding. It still leaves that white flakey mark after it dries, but you can simply wipe it off. It&#x27;s more expensive than using a styptic pencil. Average cost of a styptic pencil is around $2.99-$4.99 and this styptic gel is about $9. Considering the constant reapplication of the styptic pencil and hesitation to use it due to the burning sensation it&#x27;s well worth the extra investment. If you pair this up with a good safety razor, and other proraso products such as their sensitive shave soap and pre-shave treatment you will barely have to use this at all. Wet shaving is tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it you will have far less irritation of your face and a closer/smoother/nick free shave.</li>
    <li> I am a bleeder and have tried other products.  This works and the other products don&#x27;t.  The other products were cheap but didn&#x27;t work.  This works!</li>
    <li> It works better than the stick. Use it sparingly. Or your face will have white marks on it, like when snow melts from salt in the winter.</li>
    <li> Painless way to instantly stop bleeding from nicks and cuts.  The trick is to use as little as possible only on the cut.</li>
    <li> Stop the bleeding on contact! Just the smallest , smallest dab on your finger is all it takes. This tube may last me years! So much better than the stipic pencil.</li>
    <li> This product amazed me on how fast it works, I have used it three times and as soon as you put it on the bleeding stops</li>
    <li> This is a great product, stops bleeding fast and doesn&#x27;t burn.  Much better than the old styptic pencils!! Great! Great!</li>
    <li> I liked very much. I&#x27;ll buy again when I need one.  Is very good to rasor. Everything ok! Thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is great!  Luckily, I have only had to use it a couple of times in about 2 months, but stops the bleeding immediately and without the sting from traditional styptic pencils.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This is the best styptic product I&#x27;ve used.  It doesn&#x27;t sting your nick but does take about 5 minutes to dry so you can then flake it off. Again, good product that you will always want into your shaving supplies.</li>
    <li> No sting unlike the old day pencil.</li>
    <li> If you have used the shaving cream, you may never need this product.  I have only used it once (due to old razor).  It worked perfectly.</li>
</ol>
