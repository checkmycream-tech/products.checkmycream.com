<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am totally sold on this product. No more sulfate shampoos for me. I love how my hair feels after washing with this conditioning cleanser. My hair is fine, and thin, and this product works well for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know quite how they did it, but they managed to create a product that leaves your scalp greasy and your hair stripped of all moisture. My hair is very fine and wavy-curly, requires gentle cleansing and generous conditioning / protection to be manageable, and to let the natural curl set when air dried. This product sells as an alternative to harsh shampoos and thick conditioners, but was harsher than anything I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair (and I once used dishwashing liquid while camping). I followed the instructions to the letter, and the result was a tangled unmanageable head of frizzy hair with an oddly matted / grimy scalp. I even gave it more than one shot, read other reviews, used more product and so on. The result was always the same: an unhappy head of hair that looked like blonde cotton candy. Plus it REEKS! Although some might find the scent pleasing, for me it was like being punched in the nose with grandma&#x27;s sachet. It may work well on some other type of hair, but for baby-fine curls, this product is a disaster.</li>
    <li> The best cleansing conditioner out there hands down ! Smells amazing and there are enough suds that hair feels clean but no harsh SLS! I  have fine hair and I find that I have to wash less often after using this for awhile! On off days I use a little &amp;#34;skinny skinny &amp;#34; brand organic dry shampoo powder (buy some its the best!) and that&#x27;s all I need to skip a day. They ONLY thing I hate about this is the small size of the bottle and the pump is just stupid. Only a tiny amount comes out I have to pump it 20 times to get enough! Next time I might actually transfer it to another pump bottle that works better and add a little water . You have to add water anyway when you try to later it.... Other than that I would give it 10 stars!</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing conditioner! It smells amazing and the scent lasts for days. I too bought this because Wen is too expensive, I like this better so it&#x27;s a win, win. It leaves my hair soft and silky and the style really holds without using a styling product. The bonus is it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it doesn&#x27;t get oily as fast either, I can actually go 3 days between shampoos instead of my usual 2. My only complaint is the bottle isn&#x27;t big enough and the pump is very short, it takes a lot of pumping to lather your hair. Will I buy this again or recommend it to others...I most definitely will!</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of the Deva products. This is a nice option that is much less expensive. I always find my hair does best when I switch up my products, so I like having another option aside from the Deva. Given the price, there is no reason not to try it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that could help my hair. It was looking dry and had all these fly away hairs which I never had before.  The Wen was pricy so I looked up what Wen was a Conditioning Cleanser.  I found this and then I saw a store selling it.&lt;br /&gt;What a difference , fIRST IT TAKES SO MUCH LESS TIME TO DO MY HAIR.  I used 5 little pumps and then add 3 more, It was a very light lather , left it on for 2 minutes and rinsed out. My hair was clean and it sqeeked.  I was told at work my hair looks moist and shinny and it use to look dry.  Love this stuff, I have an extra one at home , but i want to make sure I dont run out. Its not highly advertised , Try it.. Amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is great and it smells wonderful, my hair is so wonderfully revived, soft, and touchable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review the actual day I bought this product &amp; tried it. I recently starting swimming for the summer &amp; my usual shampoo &amp; conditioner wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. I needed more hydration, so I decided to try some of these cleansing conditioners out of curiosity. I haven&#x27;t tried WEN, simply because I&#x27;m not willing to pay tons of money on a bottle that will last less than a month so I started looking into other options. First I tried Salon Grafix (which my local supermarket now carries) for about $8.00 for 12oz. Not too bad considering. I used it for several days in a row &amp; it&#x27;s pretty good. Rinses easily &amp; has next to no noticeable smell at all (which is nice). It doesn&#x27;t lather at all though &amp; you feel like you&#x27;re putting straight conditioner on top of dirty hair-which feels a bit creepy in the shower quite honestly. However, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, just soft &amp; clean. I assume this is similar to WEN. THEN out of curiosity I decided to try this Loreal version because the local drug store caries it &amp; it is also inexpensive-though the bottle is only 8oz. When you&#x27;re looking at ounces, you get less with Loreal, however it seems you don&#x27;t need to use quite as much on your hair (at least I didn&#x27;t). Maybe a couple pumps less. Loreal cleansing conditioner seems to have much more oils in it, as I noticed it really detangled my long (to my waist) hair better than the other brand did. I liked that aspect about it-it&#x27;s very conditioning. HOWEVER, the smell is JUST SOOOOOO STRONG!!! I read various reviews on it beforehand, &amp; many people mentioned the horrible smell, yet a few people liked it, so I figured I would try it myself &amp; judge. The smell is WAAAY TOO MUCH! One person mentioned it smells like sugar cookies, &amp; yes it does to an extent, but it has that really stong \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; smell as well. Imagine perfumed baby powder mixed with a hint of vanilla &amp; that&#x27;s about it. The smell lasts on your hair LONG after the shower &amp; for those sensitive to scent you WILL NOT LIKE THIS! I can see how it gave one person a headache easily. It almost did me as well + it made my scalp a little itchy too from too much fragrance. My boyfriend too could smell it at least a foot away from me. Geeze! I really don&#x27;t know why they only offer 1 scent (&amp; not a very good one at that)! Not everyone wants to smell like perfumey food. A cucumber mint would be better, or lavender, or ginger, just something more refreshing. After my hair dried, the smell persisted &amp; was so strong that I could no longer stand it. It&#x27;s just plan GROSS &amp; I decided to re-wash my hair w/my old shampoo &amp; conditioner to get it out. I didn&#x27;t want to go to bed w/that smell &amp; have it on my pillow case, etc. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but after trying to wash it out I could STILL SMELL IT in my hair &amp; this is after ONE USE PEOPLE!!!! Now that&#x27;s SCARY! For a product to be this perfumey is plain creepy &amp; I am returning it ASAP to the store. I will never buy this stuff again! How anyone can like it is beyond me. It leaves your hair feeling coated w/a film too. YUCK!!! Possibly if used regularly you might get a buildup on your hair &amp; it could get greasy. Oh well, back to Salon Grafix for me. For the record, I have not tried the RENpure brand yet. That might be my next experiment just to see how it is.</li>
    <li> My first impression of this product was to laugh at how little comes out of the bottle with each pump. You have to pump about 20 times to get enough to cleanse short hair.  The smell is fairly strong -- an artificial, plastic smell that is covered up partially by sweet vanilla tones. Luckily, the smell faded once my hair was dry. I did notice my hair felt very soft later in the day.  But overall, I prefer [[ASIN:B00641UCY8 As I Am Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, 16 Ounce]], which is another economical cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be wasting a ton of money on top-of-the-line cleansing conditioners any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this stuff smells and how silky and soft it leaves my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re addicted to Wen, but hate the price tag, I highly recommend making the switch.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an affordable cleansing conditioner for about 6 months now and have tried MANY other brands.  My hair is long, colored, naturally curly and quite dry on the ends but gets oily fairly easily on the scalp.The combination of dryness and naturally curly is not a good one leaving my hair frizzed out and ugly if i comb or brush it after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCream Sulfate-Free Cleansing Conditioner has FINALLY met my needs!  After use, I typically let my hair dry naturally and with this product it has become manageable.....I honestly thought that would never happen!  Each persons hair has different characteristics but if you have been searching for something to make your hair soft and silky instead of dry and brittle, don&#x27;t hesitate to try this product.  It really does make my hair feel healthier and has saved me from feeling as though I need to cut my hair short!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU L&#x27;OREAL!!!!</li>
    <li> nice product. used WEN for years and wanted to try something different.  provide cleansing as described, but very very strong smell. if you are okay with smell then this is a good nice substitute for WEN</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I was using Wen, but it was cost prohibitive. This is a close second and less than half the price!</li>
    <li> My wife gets this stuff and her hair smells good, she comes up to me all the time with a big smile and makes me touch her hair and smell it. I don&#x27;t mind, it is a lot softer and it smells like a cake or something.</li>
    <li> Does not work very well for my shoulder length, very thick, coarse and wavy hair. hair. For this price, one should instead simply co-wash with a cheap conditioner and perhaps shampoo one&#x27;s crown only with a tiny dollop of no-sulfate shampoo twice a week. Just not worth the money. Using this, my hair stays wet all day, then when it dries it looks about as frizzy and nasty as though I just used Prell. Sigh&lt;br /&gt;The best poo is the almost no poo. Can you make a dead person look better by applying lotion? No. Remember your hair is actually dead</li>
    <li> I am ALWAYS looking for a cream-based shampoo for my curly hair.  I am a WEN girl, but it&#x27;s way to expensive for me since I use it daily, so I tried this product and it made my hair VERY dry and hard! I would pass if you are an African American.</li>
    <li> This is one of the cheaper conditioner/shampoos in the co-wash movement, and that doesn&#x27;t make it any worse. In fact I liked this much better than the Origins product I had been using. People are dissing its smell, and I can&#x27;t understand that; it smells like a buttery vanilla. Definitely a delicious smell that really is attractive when the hair is dry. The only downer is that my scalp tends to be oily, so I can only wash with this stuff a couple times and then I need a real shampoo. Still, it leaves your hair feeling smooth and beautiful. If you have dry hair, so much the better.</li>
    <li> Yes this is as good as Wen and much cheaper. The only thing is, that this doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the Wen, but for considering its $20 cheaper - I can live with that!</li>
    <li> I loved how soft and smooth my hair was after using this, but the smell just gagged me.  The scent was so strong in the shower, and I hoped it wouldn&#x27;t be as strong after it was rinsed and dried, but unfortunately I smelled it all day and it&#x27;s gross.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, don&#x27;t buy this.  I won&#x27;t finish the bottle and definitely won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This worked just as well as Wen.  But the smell is way too strong and stinky.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase again</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something sulfate free - this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this but after two weeks of trying to make it work, I&#x27;m giving up. My hair always feels greasy, I&#x27;m experimented using different amounts and time that I let it sit in my hair but nothing worked. Maybe it would be better with someone that had very dry hair?</li>
    <li> Do not like this formula at all.  It makes my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been washing my hair with a conditioner in between shampoos for some time now, so this new cleaning conditioner is a welcome new product. It feels more like a conditioner than a shampoo but I like how it leaves my hair. However, the fragrance is very strong and sweet, too much for me so I plan to go back using regular shampoos and conditioners. It will take some time because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product but it has a weird odor and I have to use a lot of it which seems a bit wasteful.  Not as moisturizing as I expected, but not bad - just need to use more.</li>
    <li> Great for color treated hair. Smells good too and who doesn&#x27;t like great smelling hair.</li>
    <li> I saw this on the Today Show over the holidays and have been looking for it in my drugstore ever since.  I have been a fan of sulfate-free products for years because I color my hair and everytime I shampoo with nonsulfate free I imagine the color just washing off my head.  Anyway, I already use Ever Pure so am familiar  with and like Loreal products (use Feria for color).  I love this product.  They thing that most intrigued me was saving time by combining shampoo and conditioner.  Every shampoo with built-in conditioner that I have previously tried is too much shampoo and not enough conditioner.  I have really think hair so i am left with a lot of tangles.  This is not that at all.  Went on like a conditioner but also cleaned.  This is a low-poo so it will not lather up like you are used to with sulfate shampoo.  Psychologically, without the lather you may feel like your hair is not getting clean....give it a chance though because it is.  I wash my hair every 2-3 days and I also colored my hair in there so I had not \\&quot;washed\\&quot; my hair in a week.  I also love the slim pump bottle for my shower.  And yeah, it smells like vanilla and makes your hair soft, manageable, clean and not at all tangled or weighed down.  $7 for a bottle may seem pricey to some but you only need to buy one product and you don&#x27;t need a lot so it will last.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with my regular shampoo (I know that&#x27;s not how you&#x27;re supposed to do it). It works great for that function. Does require some more rinsing than I&#x27;m used to with other conditioners, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Really helps to have both shampoo and conditioner in this fabulous product.  Beats all others.  Has a wonderful fragrance.  And best of all it is quick when I am in a hurry!!</li>
    <li> Another update: I must confess I fall victim to new products and the marketing that tells us we need to change what we are doing and try this new product! So in the last two months I have tried 2 other shampoos and have come back to this Loreal cleansing conditioner. Nothing leaves my hair looking or feeling better. It is nice to have that confirmed when I try other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using Evercreme cleansing conditioner for about two months now. I discovered after several weeks I was not using it properly (thus my hair being somewhat flat and a bit oily). I came back and read some reviews and noticed some said that it is important to use the right amount (a lot!) and make sure you get a good lather. So I doubled the amount I was using and really scrubbed so the lather got all the way down to my roots. I made sure to rinse very well and after I made those changes, my hair is no longer flat and oily but perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say the only downside is that the product is more time consuming than my former habit of a two in one crappy shampoo. But my hair before was crappy and now it is fantastic. Definitely worth the time investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technical note: the pumps are inconsistent. The first bottle was great; the second bottle had a bum pump. I bought a third with another good pump. When bottle three is finished I will swap the pump with bottle 2 to finish that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loreal - is a pump really necessary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this at my local CVS after discovering on Amazon that it was available. This is my first no-poo/low-poo I have tried but I came into it knowing that it is a different experience than the traditional sudsy shampoo. I also have long believe that the sudsy shampoos are no so good for the hair or scalp so I had no ambivalence about it being a different experience and, consequently, result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried organic and sulfate-free shampoos in the past but found them either bad, inconsistent after re-order or hard to find again once I ran out. I was once again researching Wen and almost ordered when I googled \\&quot;Wen alternatives\\&quot; and found this L&#x27;oreal. Since I never tried Wen I cannot compare the two. But reading about Wen the directions are to use it twice, and let it set on the hair for 6 minutes. That is a long time for me to keep shampoo on my head when I am rushing in the shower after the gym to get to work. And the price of Wen...oy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme cleansing conditioner for about 5 days so not long but I think it&#x27;s a keeper. I have fine, thin hair and was worried that it would be flat and lifeless from this. Well, my hair is not as voluminous as before but there are enough other benefits that overrule that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has gone from very dry and damaged (both in looks and feel) to absolutely soft, silky and shiny. My hair now looks and feels HEALTHY! My hair looks so much better with this Evercreme cleansing conditioner that I am not missing the volume I had before (there is still volume, just not as much). I have been running my hands thru my hair so much these past few days - I have never done that before! And my scalp feels healthy and happy now too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used to shed a lot of hair. My bathroom counter would be covered with it after styling (I use a hair dryer and hot iron every day). I was hoping my scalp would improve and the hair loss would diminish. It is too soon to call the result on this but my scalp does feel much happier and my hair shedding has been going down a bit every day since I started this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if these results keep up, I have been converted for life!!! Good job, L&#x27;oreal.</li>
    <li> (only gave this 5 stars for its power to work as a great makeup brush cleanser and not for hair) like any makeup artist would tell you, they&#x27;ll say wash your brushes with shampoo and condition it to keep it soft and make it last longer. well with this product you get 2 in one with it and with its very strong cleaning agent in it it gets rid of all the makeup out of your dirtiest brushes with 1 to 2 uses. since it also is a conditioner as its a cleaner you don&#x27;t have to do 2 steps with cleaning your brushes at all. im not so crazy for the smell of this hair cleanser but its bearable in the end and really really works. i originally got this product for my hair since im going natural but i didn&#x27;t like that it suds up still like a regular shampoo, its a thicker consistency that kinda looks like a cleansing conditioner but its still a shampoo with really strong grease fighting cleansers in it. do i think its a good product for women going natural NOPE!!!!! but is it a great brush cleanser YES!!!!!!. i&#x27;ll buy this again for cleaning the makeup brushes i have and since its in a nice sized bottle it&#x27;ll last for a long while.</li>
    <li> The product is too heavily perfumed. Way too strong.</li>
    <li> Fore me the smell was horrible.  I also felt like it weighted my hair down.</li>
    <li> My postmenopausal, over processed, sun baked, UV fried, hard water abused hair went from old icky sticky thin straw to sleek, thicker, no tangles at all (none, no post shampoo war zone or heaps of slimy goos to get out the tangles out of my hip length mess of hair!). The color started to come back, the waves and curl began to recover after years of stress and abuse in this top of the Divide climate and nasty hard water in Montana. Every so often I do use the &#x27;matching&#x27; non sulfite shampoo and conditioner when i really get dirty out in the woods or the garden or just sweaty as this cleansing conditioner tends to be on the slightly &#x27;greasy&#x27; side. I also do often use a touch of leave in &#x27;silk&#x27; conditioner or the Marrakesh style oils we make with sandalwood, argan etc in jojoba base just to keep the sleek and shine at a maximum and every so often I need a shampoo! So the matching shampoos are also sulfate FREE as is the conditioner. PERFECT trio! You just have to get used to no lather.. Bubbles don&#x27;t clean.. Solutions clean.. bubbles were added to distract housewives... they have NO cleaning power... so LOL.. let goooo of your bubbles and say hello to clean soft, conditioned and pampered hair for pennies on the dollar for what you&#x27;ll spend for the big name TV brands.</li>
    <li> I love the everpure line and was excited to see this new product... especially pleased that it was a two in one concept... I used it the first time but noticed that my hair took longer to blow dry but didn&#x27;t think much of it... I&#x27;ve used it a second time now and confirmed that it&#x27;s much harder to blow dry and even now, several hours later, my hair feels coated and heavy like too much waxy buildup.... It&#x27;s too bad because I love the smell.... I did not like the pump bottle design because very little comes out with each pump so I end up needing to pump it about 15 times to get enough for my hair length.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair and an oily scalp. While the product smells amazing and left my hair feeling soft and easy to comb through, my scalp feels like I haven&#x27;t washed in days. The ends of my hair are soft and bouncy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I really want to grow out my hair, but the ends usually get so dry and scraggly. If I could just balance out my scalp AND keep the ends healthy, I could grow it out. So, I gave this product another try, but FIRST I washed my scalp with my usual shampoo, and then used the Evercreme as directed. The result: a squeaky clean scalp and soft, bouncy hair!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful combination of quality and price. High-priced shampoos and conditioners have been drying my hair. This natural combination shampoos and conditions all in one.</li>
    <li> I had seen the infomercial for another cleansing conditioner and had long considered trying one, but the price scared me.  Kudos to L&#x27;Oreal for creating some competition in the market and providing a quality product at a lower price.  My hair initially feels a little greasy straight out of the shower, but as I let it airdry (never been one for blowdrying my hair) the greasiness disappears.  Soft and great smelling, plus no more tangles!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! I wanted to try WEN, but was deterred by the price and also the negative reviews here on amazon.  Then I saw this and thought I&#x27;d try it.  I figured if I hated this stuff, then I was sure to hate WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used probably a good 20 pumps the first time.  and rubbed it all around.  Let it sit a few minutes, and my dry hair and turned to silk.  It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the type of hair that can get greasy if I use too much conditioner...this stuff does NOT make my hair greasy.  After 4 days I noticed it was a tiny bit greasy, so I did regular shampoo and conditioner one night, then back to this stuff.  But even when I use regular shampoo, I notice my hair is strong, shiny, soft...just amazing really.  I bet I would love WEN, but it&#x27;s way too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I listened to a previous review that said to make sure you use enough...YES!  I have medium length hair.  I use 10 pumps for the front, 3 for each side, and a few for the back and ends.  I use a lot.  It&#x27;s been three weeks and my bottle is almost empty.  I&#x27;m very happy though.  Great product for the price.  My hair is so much stronger and healthier.  Try this, you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> workes as well as the Wen product I was using and alot cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product sounded too good to be true in the reviews, but it definitely isn&#x27;t for me. I have shoulder length curly hair. For those who are into curly hair, mine is a little fine but forms soft bouncy Botticelli S-curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCreme several tries. The first couple of times, I followed the directions to a T. The other times, I tried suggestions I found online. The results were always the same: hair with a terrible texture, a weird dry and coated at the same time feel, weighed down curls and an OMG-I-Can&#x27;t-Take-It-Anymore smell. Way too perfumey. The stench gave me a headache. Even if the product had made my hair look and feel great, there&#x27;s no way I could&#x27;ve kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s working for so many people, but it won&#x27;t be gracing my shelves or my auburn locks again.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and how this conditioner makes my hair shine and frizz free but I can&#x27;t put a comb through my hair.  I have curly hair and breakage is a big concern.  Loreal doesn&#x27;t know how to make products for curly hair including their curly hair line.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine-textured and curly. Co-washing has always left my hair looking heavy &amp; greasy but this product turned my frizzy locks into perfect spirals. My only complaint is that I&#x27;m not crazy about the strong perfume-y smell. The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger on my hair, so I can put up with it.</li>
    <li> I use this product whenever I need a quick cleanse and I don&#x27;t have time for a full shampoo and conditioner.  I absolutely love the way it makes my hair feel.  I don&#x27;t need a leave-in conditioner when I&#x27;m done.  I have colored frizzy fine curly hair that is fairly healthy.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars since I am sensitive to smells and also really hate the smell.  I wish they could do something about the smell!  However, I still love using it when I need to.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I tried the Sally&#x27;s version of Wen last year, Hair One, and couldn&#x27;t stand it.  My hair was a greasy mess and my face broke out horribly.  I threw it out.  I started using another of the Loreal Ever line and liked it a lot. I started using this recently and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The scent is amazing, and my scalp doesn&#x27;t have an icky feeling at all.  I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where people hated this, but I wonder if they were over doing it.  Some have said they&#x27;re using like 20 or more pumps of product, and I can&#x27;t help but wonder if they&#x27;re using too much.  I have shoulder length hair, and can get away with 10 or less pumps.  I typically use just enough to work it onto my scalp, maybe six pumps, work it aound and then pull to my ends, adding just a pump or more to concentrate on my ends.  I wash up, shave my legs and rinse well.  It&#x27;s not a traditional shampoo and will not lather, if at all.  My hair feels clean and so does my scalp. I haven&#x27;t used a trAditional shampoo in two months since switching to the Loreal line.  I use the spray in conditioner when I get out, no more than five sprays, and I&#x27;m good to go.  Haven&#x27;t had to use any additional products outside of a light hairspray to finish before I leave the house.  And I&#x27;m not breaking out, either.  For $6 you can&#x27;t beat it.  I was prepared to hate this product, to be honest, figured I&#x27;d throw it out or add water to it and use as a leave in spray.  Boy, was I wrong.  I&#x27;ve washed my hair every day since I was a teenager, but those days are over.  Try it, for $6 you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.  You&#x27;ve paid more for a latte that you didn&#x27;t think was all that great...</li>
    <li> I waited until I used this product for one month to write a review.  This product has transformed my hair from dry and frizzy to soft and luxurious.  It has been truly amazing.  I am 45-years-old, with color-treated hair.  My hair had become so frizzy no matter what I conditioned with.  I read about this product and started using it.  First of all, you have to get over that thing where we think we have to have suds to clean the hair.  The lack of sulfates in the product means it doesn&#x27;t sud.  After even the first time you use it, your hair is remarkably softer.  After about a week, no more frizz, and after a month, my hair texture looks like it did 20 years ago, though it is colored now.  I would highly recommend this product.  I think I paid $5-6 for mine at Albertsons.  The other thing, and this is really weird, but I now truly feel like I only need to shampoo every 2-3 days, which I have never done before.  I always shampooed every day, but this keeps my hair so fresh, great smelling, and soft. By the way, I use the same styling gel and other products on my hair that I did before, only changed the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I adore this cleansing conditioner for my twin boys hair.  Their hair was just a hard frizzy mess...even with sulfate free shampoos.  Now they have Perfect, Soft, and Defined curls.  It has a bit of a \\&quot;lather\\&quot;, and smells DELICIOUS!  I dont need to condition their hair after i use it...just some leave in, and oil and their hair just becomes a mass of shiny 3b &amp; c curls.  It also doesn&#x27;t irritate their eyes...which I love.  And their hair just smells so good!!  I&#x27;m just going to buy a handfull of bottles, so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> Amazing! 20 stars. Just get used to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of suds, add water and keep washing and rinsing for 1 to 2 minutes. Brilliant! can&#x27;t say enough good stuff. My hair has body, feels, smells and looks great right after I dry it whereas usually, it takes 3 days before it has body after a shampoo (unless I use a ton of product or spray)</li>
    <li> My only complaint is is has an odd smell to it. I noticed another reviewer likened it to vanilla but there is also something chemical-y to it that I don&#x27;t like. The smell keeps me from using it more than a few days a week - while I don&#x27;t mind it too much because the smell rinses out it seems to keep me from immediately reaching for this product. If you are very sensitive to fragrances or chemical odors this product might be too much for you. But besides that it does a nice job of conditioning my very fine, very dense hair without weighing it down. It definitely does not get greasy as fast as it would if I were using a different conditioner, so I&#x27;m able to use it allover including the roots instead of just on the tips like other conditioners. Good stuff but I wish there was an odor/fragrance free version.</li>
    <li> I have been shampoo free for almost a year now because of this conditioner. I tried a bunch of different types but this gave me the best results for the money. The smell is a little iffy but my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> I tried this once and originally decided that I did not like it. To give a little background, I am a Black female with the kind of kinky hair that will easily dry into a very small fro or blow dry into a big fluffy mane. These days, I opt to blow dry my hair once per week before styling. I leave my style in for a week. Well, due to m dermatitis, I decided to try a regimen of no-poo (cleansing with conditioner only) and I stopped using a leave-in. This initially seemed to help, but the thing about dermatitis (or at least in MY case) is that the scalp will often develop this oily buildup. A conditioner will NOT get rid of that. SO, I caved in and made an attempt to go middle of the road. Enter Loreal Evercreme cleansing conditioner! First of all, the price is not bad! I get mine at my local NEX for about $5.85 or so and I can usually find $1.00 coupons, though I did not have one today. Anyway, when I tried this previously, I tried to comb it through my hair, expecting it to have the slippery feel that I experienced with Wen. Well, it didn&#x27;t. Since so many reviews were comparing the product to Wen, I tired to use it the way that Wen prescribes. However, the bottle does not advertise it as a comb-through product, so that was my mistake. After I rinsed, I tried to comb my damp hair with no success. the thing is, I had tried a new comb and the COMB was the culprit! I even took the product back and got a full refund. Today, I decided to give the product another go. Unlike most reviewers, I DID experience a creamy lather. I don&#x27;t use product in my hair, so this ma be the reason. I lathered it up and let it sit on my hair just like the bottle says. Once I rinsed, I was able to comb through my hair MUCH easier and lost a LOT less hair as a result. I did my usual cool-blowdrying to stretch my hair out and prepare it for styling and VOILA!!! My hair was smoother and softer than with my normal conditioner wash routine. I think this MIGHT be a keeper! We shall see.... Oh and I DOLOVE THE FRAGRANCE! My hair was MUCH easier to manage as well!</li>
    <li> Did not cleanse my hair.  Threw the rest of the bottle away.  Waste of money and a waste of time.  Not even worth the trouble returning it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to do a side by side test on sulphate free conditioners.  I started making my own shampoo, so wanted a nice conditioner to help tame the mane.  I have butt length, thick, wavy hair, that likes to frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I like this Loreal conditioner the most, of the others that will remain unnamed.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a ton of residue behind, usually made most apparent on my hair brush.  My hair is soft, smooth, light. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, a bit perfumy, for conditioner,  but nice I think.  I go 4 days in between hair washings, and this does not make my scalp go all greasy too early.  Big bonus.  I am purchasing more, right now!  Anyone know where to get a larger bottle of this?</li>
    <li> Like everyone else i loved it THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. The second time was okay but by the third, all i have a grease up doo. I loved how it worked the first time then i waited 2 days and used it again. I usually wash my hair every 2-3 days. So after waiting 3 more days and then used it for the third time. It did not work at all. First of all it is $7.00 for 8.3 ounces and it takes 10-12 pumps to even get enough to coat my hair and i have very baby fine thin hair just past my ears. Imagine if you had thick or long hair. You would  need the whole bottle. I am going to try it one more time and i am going to comb it through my hair to be sure i get it all and see what happens then i will update this review. It smells really good. Like Vanilla Almonds. Its says Low Lather but thats not correct. There is absolutely 0 lather. Its a very very thick cream. Almost like paste. Very hard to spread through hair. I hope this will help anyone looking into this product. Maybe its not for every day use!! Or in my case every 2-3 days use.</li>
    <li> I can not even get pass the smell! amy gf used this and has thick black hair and she hated it. It knotted her hair. I have caucasian hair used it and it didnt feel clean and the smell almost knocked me out. My hair felt greasy.</li>
    <li> Had purchased in hopes it would be a more cost effective replacement for WEN, but It wasn&#x27;t. Doesn&#x27;t deserve 1 star since it did leave my hair pretty soft and clean. But it does not compare to the body and conditioning I have when I use WEN. Still a good cleansing conditioner, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I read about this in a magazine and was intrigued, but could not find it in stores, so bought it on Amazon.  I am not impressed at all, conditioning quality is poor and just feels weird in my hair,  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have medium length, color treated wavy hair that is dry on the ends and oily at the scalp. I tried Wen, but never felt like it cleaned my hair. This Loreal product, is very different to me. It does not really lather, but it foams and feels more like a shampoo than Wen, but when I rinse it, my hair feels smooth and slick, like I have used a deep conditioner. I have found you don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much of this product as you do Wen. I use about the same amount of this as I would use a regular conditioner, however, I apply it to my scalp first, whereas with regular conditioner I would put on the ends first. It does help to add a little water, since it foams up much better that way. Then I work the foam to the ends of my hair and pin it up while I shower. Then it rinses out easily (I use a wide-tooth comb in the shower while I rinse). My hair comes out smoother after drying and is less frizzy and much more manageable. I have used it for a week and have not noticed any built-up either. I can even skip a day on shampooing if I want to. I love this product, it saves a step in the shower, it travels easily, and it is affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen -- loved --  (but pricey),&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve used Pantene - loved --  (Truly Natural Hair co wash cleaning conditioner),&lt;br /&gt;Hated this product... strong smell that I detested, you must use a nice amount of conditioning cleansers for them to work.  Such a small amount comes in the bottle... and is dispensed per pump -- not worth it.  Mine is going in the trash!</li>
    <li> I have wavy thin hair and I love to wear it without straightening but lately it has been so dry and frizzy and no matter how many salon high end brands I used it stayed the same. Tried this out and after one week my hair has been softer and shinier and after two weeks my hair looks thicker and my natural waves are coming out more. For this price I hope this never stops being produced!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this stuff.  I had been using WEN for about a year with iffy results.  It just never seemed clean enough but the results were better than with a sulfate based shampoo.  This new Loreal cleanser is amazing!  My hair is not too flat or frizzy, it is soft and flowy and I almost never have a bad hair day lately.  It also has a very satisfying low lather that is very creamy and soothing.  And the price, cannot say enough good about that.  It also smells delicious.  If you don&#x27;t like vanilla you may not like it. You do have to use a fair amount of it to get the results, but it is so worth it.  I highly recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for a few years now and I love it!  I have baby fine, color-treated, wavy hair that I struggled to grow past my collar bone for many years.  Not any more!  My hair is much healthier since using cleansing conditioner, even though I still wash my hair just about every day.  I still use a sulfate shampoo and deep conditioner about once a week after doing an oil treatment, but this is my go-to product during the remainder of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain it weighs down their hair, but here&#x27;s my trick:  I remove about 1.5 ounces from a new bottle (put it in a travel size bottle from a drug store) and then I replace that with an equal amount of distilled water to thin the product a bit.  Shake the bottle to mix.  This makes it easier to pump and work into my hair and scalp, and, of course, makes the product last a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. Bottle is a little small. I have a lot of hair. But I really love this.</li>
    <li> I have fine-ish, straight hair and hard water (which I&#x27;m sure makes a difference). I was really hoping to love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it half a dozen times so far, including taking a brush/comb in the shower to facilitate distributing the creme through my hair and for trying to make sure it&#x27;s rinsed out. No matter how long I stand there running and combing the fresh water through my hair, I can tell even while my hair is still wet that there&#x27;s product residue, and it dries into a sticky, tacky, nowhere-near-clean mess.  Other people love this product, so I&#x27;m going to blame the hard water for 70% and my hair type for a bit more. After washing my hair tonight with regular shampoo, I&#x27;ll try a regular conditioner-only wash for comparison...</li>
    <li> My daughter has long curly hair. It&#x27;s not wavy or kinky curly, it&#x27;s thick with ringlet curls. She&#x27;s a soccer player so she pretty much has to wash her hair every day during the season. She can&#x27;t use shampoo very often but she does use sulfate free every week or so to clarify.This conditioning cleanser is a pretty good product with a great price point. We&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this one works pretty well. One problem with it is that you can&#x27;t usually find it in stores so we have to order it on amazon. I&#x27;d recommend it but would probably rotate it with other conditioning cleansers as this product does seem to leave build up on her hair after a while.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it. After second time using hair started looking oily. I don&#x27;t have oily hair but I have blonde fine hair and maybe it is not good for my type.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is nice, but you have to be aware while you&#x27;re using this product. It doesn&#x27;t lather, so you may end up using too much thinking it isn&#x27;t working. Also, rinsing it can be a quite a process as well since it feels like it still stays in your hair. Overall, I like the scent and the way it leaves my hair. Try not to overuse it and make sure to rinse it well; If not, your hair may feel greasy and will need another wash.</li>
    <li> This is my very FAVE conditioning cleanser and I&#x27;ve tried many. It smells awesome! Beats Wen for cost hands down and excellent product!!</li>
    <li> I recently tried this after someone on a haircare forum alerted me that Loreal had a new \\&quot;Ever\\&quot; line out. I am already a big fan of the EverPure, EverSleek &amp; EverStrong lines so I had to try it. I went out and bought the entire line that night. I have to say this line smells incredible. It smells like vanilla. So far I have used the the Loreal EverCreme Conditioning Cream Cleanser &amp; Loreal Nourishing Leave In Conditioning Spray. I tell you I am impressed, the Conditioning Cleanser cleaned my hair enough to remove any residue but left my tresses feeling soft and moist. I clarified my hair before I tried this &amp; I used this to replace some much needed moisture. Let me also mention that if you suffer from dry brittle hair then you will more than likely love the Leave In, I didnt pay much attention to the fact that in my shopping bag I didnt hear the usual liquid splashing around but the next day when I went to use the leave in spray I always shake treatments of the leave in nature to evenly distribute any settled ingredients however I didnt hear the splashing sound so I unscrewed the cap and to my great surprise it wasnt liquid,it was a more of a thick cream consistency which made me all the more eager to try it and I was not disappointed. My airdried hair dried smooth and frizz free. I will be trying the other EverCreme products I purchased really soon. I would highly recommend this line to anybody that suffers from dry parched strands.Not pictured is the masque..</li>
    <li> Super strong smell like men&#x27;s cologne. Not pleasant.</li>
    <li> It works for me pretty well as I have dry hair but it  lingers in hair and you can feel there is build-up even after through rinsing. My husband has tried it in his hair and really makes it greasy-looking fast.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff, but I just hate it. I have very thick, very strong curly hair, that tends to be just a little bit dry in winter. I dye my hair red, so I figured that this might help me keep my color longer...NOPE. My hair felt clean and non-greasy and I actually enjoy the smell, but no matter how much I rinsed, it made my scalp unbearably itchy. I&#x27;ve NEVER had that problem before. Even after washing with another shampoo, the itchiness persisted. I also noticed that it made my hair appear very dull, and it somehow washed out 10x more color than my Aveda Color Conserve. I have noticed quite a bit of breakage as well, which is very unusual for me.</li>
    <li> A staple of mine. This particular cleansing conditioner is my favorite of all I have tried from L&#x27;Oreal and other manufacturers. My hair is dry and I use product and hairspray. I rely on it to blast through product buildup to leave my hair looking and feeling great. Terrific product!</li>
    <li> I have long (past mid-back), thick, wavy, color treated hair. I have yet to find a traditional shampoo/conditioner combination that does not leave my hair extremely frizzy when not blow dried. I&#x27;ve wanted to try [[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]] for a long time, but being a mother of 3 (including a newborn), nearly $40 for shampoo is just outrageous. I&#x27;d found cheaper alternatives, like [[ASIN:B002W2N1J6 Hair One Hair Cleanser and Conditioner with Jojoba 355ml/12oz - For Color-Treated Hair]] but even $15 seemed like too much to risk for the negative reviews it received. If I *knew* I would like those products, the investment might not seem so bad. But it just wasn&#x27;t worth the risk to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner. At $6.99 (with Prime 2-day free shipping - yay!) I figured I couldn&#x27;t lose. I usually pay between $3-5 each for shampoo and conditioner, so this was right in my price range. And let me tell you, worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it because so many reviewers had stated how amazing it smells. TRUE STORY! It smells like heaven wrapped in newborn innocence rolling down a hill of sugar. Seriously though, it&#x27;s kind of vanilla, kind of coconut-y, very grown up and sophisticated. It has hints of tanning oil in my mind. LOVE the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do have to make sure your hair is thoroughly wet. I also squeeze the excess from the ends. With my hair length, I had to use about 15 pumps to really coat my hair. Leave it on for 2 mins, rinse, voila all done! Very thick, creamy formula that, as I said, smells freaking wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw at least one person complain that her hair took longer to blow dry. I agree, but that&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re no longer stripping your hair of natural oils. It takes longer because it&#x27;s healthier. It&#x27;s the first cleansing product I&#x27;ve ever used where I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair afterward, it dries beautifully and makes my natural waves gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just give it a chance. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I&#x27;ll be stocking up on this soon as it&#x27;s not available in my area and who knows if/when they will suddenly discontinue it anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Edit 2/27/12 - I figured out what it smells like - [[ASIN:B002PUUXY6 Victoria&#x27;s Secret Dream Angels Heavenly Perfume 15 mL]] ! So awesome. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and as noted before it does take longer to dry my hair now, but it also dries smoother and is much easier to style. It even holds curl better - I could never get my hair to do that before. It feels different at first, but you have to remember your scalp has to get used to the fact that you aren&#x27;t abusing it with sulfates and drying chemicals anymore. Once the scalp calms down, it will stop producing as much oil. If you brush your hair often and only wash your hair every other day, it will help. :) Also, this is finally available in my area, and the Prime eligible price on Amazon is only $1 more than the Walmart I shop at. Great price, I hope they don&#x27;t jack it up anytime soon.and makes my natural waves gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just give it a chance. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.

    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I tried this, because it really works.  I wet my hair &amp; used about 20 pumps-worth &amp; worked it all over my hair from scalp to ends of the hair &amp; I left it on for about 5 minutes--I did a few other beauty regimens, before I finally went in the shower to rinse it out.  The results were amazing, my hair is so clean, soft, &amp; manageable.  I will be using this product once a week!</li>
    <li> I have very dry scalp and tend to get dandruff after using products with a lot of harsh chemicals, so I decided to give this product a try. I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I&#x27;ve already seen major improvements in my scalp, and my hair has never felt better. The conditioner leaves your hair smelling amazing all day long. It also leaves it soft, shiny, and silky. The only downfall is that if you longer hair, you will need to use a LOT of this conditioner to get it to cover your hair and seep into your scalp. I found that adding a bit of water to the conditioner after it&#x27;s already in your hair helps it lather a little and stretches the product out so you can use a little less, but if you don&#x27;t use enough, your hair probably will look oily when you&#x27;re done. Even though I have to use a lot of this product, it&#x27;s still worth it to me because you don&#x27;t use a shampoo with it and I can see it saving a lot of money in the long run. Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice since I got it, hence the four star review as I need to see how it is after a month or so. BUT - I have been using Wen for over 2 years and decided to try the EverCreme and I am shocked at how soft and manageable this leaves my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dyed my naturally blonde hair brown for over 9 years and recently bleached it back to blonde. This really damaged my hair. I was about to cut 3 inches off of it as no amount of moisture, keratin treatments, or over night oil was helping the fried ends. After using the cleansing conditioner and the EverCreme deep conditioning masque just twice each, my ends look healthy again! My hair also has more body than it has since I went back to blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are some pro and con comments on the smell but I actually like it and I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried soooo many products to try to restore the health to my hair, and I have had some pretty good success but it still gets frizzy and looks damaged. I have to say that EverCreme has made my hair look and feel healthier than everything else I was using. It&#x27;s even shinier. I am pretty blown away - I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price. I am going to stock up on this stuff. I may come back and upgrade to five stars if the first two uses are any indication of things to come.</li>
    <li> I thought I was really going to like this product. Unlike others, I like the scent BUT, there is also a chemical scent in the background. In fact, it has such a strong chemical odor that halfway through washing, I panicked thinking it smelled like hair remover. I have very average hair, not oily and not dry. I am Asian and my hair is shiny and straight. I was a little worried this would make my hair look greasy. However, much to my surprise, my hair felt dry. In fact, the ends felt crunchy which never happens to me.  My hair did have body but between the chemical smell and the crunchy ends, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like how this left my hair feeling gunky</li>
    <li> I recently got a sample of [[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]in a subscription program I am in, I fell in love hard, however the price deterred me. I didn&#x27;t want to be hooked on the silky soft feeling that Wen created in my hair if it was going to cost an arm and a leg. I thought there must be something out there that is awesome and there is, it&#x27;s this stuff. It works just as well as Wen does and it&#x27;s WAAAAAAAAAAAY cheaper. I got this at Target for $5.99. I hope that people try this and love it and it doesn&#x27;t end up being discontinued. A lot of people won&#x27;t understand how to use this product so I am afraid they will give up and sales will suffer. Remember that you need to use a fair amount of this stuff for it to work well and actually CLEAN your hair, not just condition it. Those who say it works well at first and their hair ends up greasy, they are not using enough product, and they are not rubbing it in and massaging it to a low low lather. It&#x27;s like washing a dirty window with just ONE spray of Windex and one paper towel, you&#x27;re just spreading the dirt around and going no where fast. Try it, look up conditioning cleansers, like wen, learn about sulfate free shampoos, and improve the condition of your hair because like L&#x27;Oreal say&#x27;s : You&#x27;re worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is AMAZING. I&#x27;m hooked to the scent, it&#x27;s very vanilla-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/8/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot more positive review for this product since I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively the past 6 months. I can tell you that I seriously do love it and I&#x27;ve recommended it to every single one of my friends. I have gotten them all hooked on the ever pure line! My best friend and I exclusively use the cleansing conditioner and the matching shampoo and conditioner too. I even tell people in the grocery stores if they are looking at that they need to try it because it works amazing and smells divine. I don&#x27;t know if I sound like a crazy person but I have no shame :-P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has started growing longer faster, the condition of it has improved so well that I stopped using any leave in conditioners or any product in my hair for frizz or fly aways. I was using some seriously expensive stuff just to get by before. This stuff makes my hair silky and smooth and I&#x27;ve ALWAYS been fighting with dry frizzy hair. I used to switch between shampoos constantly trying to find something that worked, I&#x27;d try something and it would work at first and then my hair would rebel and I&#x27;d be back to the same dry and frizzy unmanageable mop. Not with this tho, I&#x27;ve stuck with it and I&#x27;m seriously not lying when I say I&#x27;m in love. I LOVE the smell of my hair and so does everyone who hugs me :p I catch myself playing with my hair more and smelling it, again I might look like a crazy person but I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m confident when I say that I&#x27;ll continue to use this product as long as it&#x27;s available, I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they discontinued it. I don&#x27;t mind raving on and on like a spokesperson about this product line because I&#x27;d stand by my word, comfortably knowing that it&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;m tired of the shenanigans I see all the time with super models or celbs saying a product is the bees knees and come to find out it wax and snake oil, real women using a product and raving about it is best testimony out there. I&#x27;d put my name behind it and I don&#x27;t take that lightly. I always check out a products amazon reviews before I buy something in stores or online because of that, I want real advice and experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six months and I&#x27;m still using the same stuff, my husband would testify that that&#x27;s enough to buy stock. I thank L&#x27;Oreal for my good hair and he thanks L&#x27;Oreal for a heavier wallet :-P:-P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has started growing longer faster, the condition of it has improved so well that I stopped using any leave in conditioners or any product in my hair for frizz or fly aways.

    <li> I have a cosmetologist license so I usually buy professional brands.  I have heard a lot about the Wen system but could not justify the cost.  When I saw L&#x27;Oreal for $8 a bottle I thought why not, it seems very similar to what I&#x27;ve heard of Wen.  I have very thick hair down to the middle of my back.  I usually use Paul Mitchell shampoo, detangler, leave in conditioner, and a silk leave in shine oil.  After all that my hair is still a knot ball!  After using L&#x27;Oreal I was amazed.  Only 1 product and my hair is not knotted and feels silky smooth.  I have used conditioner my whole life, amazing I no longer have to!!!  I need about 10 pumps in my hair but that is rally not a lot for the amount in the bottle! Definitely a product you want to give a shot!!!!</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the reviews here I will say this is MUCH better than WEN. I tried WEN and had a seriously negative reaction. This product keeps my color well, keeps my hair soft and shiny, and it is the only stuff that works with my four year old daughter&#x27;s naturally curly hair without creating frizz. I used to use it solely for her because I was afraid of another bad reaction but snuggling with her after a bath and smelling her amazingly great smelling hair I couldn&#x27;t help myself. I tried it and soon ditched the very pricy salon shampoo  I had been using. I LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> These people are exaggerating saying that it smells horrible when it doesn&#x27;t smell that damn bad seriously! i have smelled better but by no means is it horrible, it&#x27;s just more natural so it doesn&#x27;t have the fragrance smell in it. it&#x27;s worked wonders for my hair</li>
    <li> I have sulfa allergies so I try to limit exposure to the sodium laurel sulfate that seems to be in everything (check your toothpaste).  athis does a nice job conditioning hair without weighing it down.  I personally have very short fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use another shampoo!  Take getting used to no suds, but love it!!  My hair is so much healthier!</li>
    <li> Well, my hair is a disaster. It&#x27;s thick, coarse, and had weird waves. On top of that, I use a flat iron and color my own hair. So to counteract all the abuse I give it I&#x27;ve always looked for shampoos and conditioners to help \\&quot;add moisture\\&quot; and \\&quot;tame frizz\\&quot; or make it \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;. The I stumbled upon the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; method whereas you quit shampooing altogether and just condition it, or use apple cider vinegar as a conditioner. I figured I&#x27;d go that route, but I couldn&#x27;t stand smelling like apple cider vinegar and I felt like my scalp desperately needed to be cleansed with shampoo again. Back to square one. I had used the Loreal sulfate free shampoos in the past and I loved the scent and I decided to go back to them. I happened to come across the Cleansing Conditioner and figured this could be the answer to what my hair needs; a lot of conditioner and a little cleanser.  First impression, the smell is awesome. Once again, Loreal has made a delicious scent for their product. After washing my hair with it I was SO disappointed! It literally felt like a dumped a waxy substance all over my hair. I went from having non greasy hair to stringy greasy nastiness. What happened was I rinsed only briefly instead of thoroughly. I&#x27;m used to partially rinsing conditioner  out of my hair trying to retain some of its moisture. Apparently, to make this product effective you need to rinse, rinse, and rinse some more. And then after that, rinse again!!!&lt;br /&gt;So, that&#x27;s what I did today; tried the Cleansing Conditioner again, rinsed like crazy and used the Lanza Color Care Trauma Treatment as a leave in product. My hair isn&#x27;t all glamorous now, and totally frizz free, but it feels super soft and lovely. For me, that&#x27;s a score! I figure I&#x27;ll keep doing this routine and will update again in a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on a side note, I saw the WEN infomercial the other night and I was wishing I had the money to fork out for it. I am so glad to hear the reviews of those who&#x27;ve tried Loreal and Wen, and still like Loreal just as much. Hooray!</li>
    <li> Pretty good for a conditioning cleanser.  Use between regular shampoos.</li>
    <li> I switched from WEN to this specifically because of the price. I loved the way WEN made my hair feel, but I would feel horrible about spending so much money on something for my hair. I gave it up, and stumbled across this a few weeks later. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! It works just as well as WEN and at a fraction of the cost. Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews deter you. You do have to use a pretty good amount of this to make sure that it covers your hair, and you have to make sure that you rinse your hair thoroughly. It smells great, although I do have to say I like the sort of minty smell of WEN better, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference. All in all, this is a great product and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This is the best drugstore haircare product I have ever used. I, too, have used WEN. This works as well as WEN for me and is less than half the price. I use 10-15 pumps for my fine shoulder-length hair. I find that my hair is actually less oily using this product which is marketed as a moisturizing product. Go figure. Anyway, it is a great find. Take it from someone who is used to paying $20+ for a bottle of shampoo and another $20+ for the conditioner. This is a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> After my first use I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with the product, but after using it consistently for about 5 days my hair looks and feels better. I have thin/fine hair and lots of fly aways that get very unruly in the humidity. This product has helped tame those fly aways for sleeker looking hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works well for my fine straight long hair. No hair loss like I had with Wen.</li>
    <li> Unlike a lot of reviews on here, I have never tried Wen. I can, however, say that without having a hair cut in over a year aside from 1/8 of an inch here and there, my hair was in desperate need of some TLC. I have to hairspray it into a pony tail in order to avoid the frizz, and wearing it down just isn&#x27;t an option because pieces of my hair were wavy and others are straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this once. Straight out of the shower, after wearing my hair in an unkempt purposely messy pony tail/bun full of product, I was able to run a brush through my wet hair just once without hitting a single tangle. I took it out of my pony tail today and it had the smoothest wave to it (the waves were all around from a twisted pony tail). It was shiny, I could run my fingers through it, and I had it in a pony tail without a single spritze of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers said they had to use a lot of product, but I trusted one reviewer that said it isn&#x27;t necessary because you shouldn&#x27;t expect a huge lather. That reviewer was right. I used maybe 3-4 pumps and that was more than enough for my armpit length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers mentioned that it&#x27;s an overwhelming smell. I think what they&#x27;re smelling is a lack of perfume in the product. This is a soft, clean smell. So many of us are used to picking something off a shelf, doing a sniff test and not even looking at what a product does before handing over our credit cards. I was smelling my hair all day and it was wonderful. I even got weird and asked my coworker to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so excited to have found something that keeps my summer hair in check and already after one use makes it feel healthier. For the price, I love it. For not having to purchase it at an overpriced beauty store like sephora or ulta, I love it even more. L&#x27;oreal easily could have charged double for something of this quality. I don&#x27;t think it will be long before this becomes the product every beauty blogger starts talking about!</li>
    <li> I shampoo my short hair daily and I use this every other day alternating between my regular shampoo plus conditioner routine to cleansing with this very gentle cleansing conditioner. I color my hair and it keeps my scalp from drying out. I tend to have a dry scalp so this product has been particularly kind to me.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for more than a year, as a post-swim shampoo and conditioner. i love the smell, and the price isn&#x27;t bad. doesnt build up in my hair, and my long, color treated hair still feels soft and smooth after my daily swims. just switched to pantene&#x27;s cleansing conditioner to see if i can get the same results with a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this product for my fine, color-treated, highlighted (read \\&quot;chemically damaged\\&quot;) hair. I was using Wen but found it extremely expensive and sometimes frustrated with results.  I love that the L&#x27;Oreal company has made it a point to not include animal products and I can fully endorse the no paraben formula.  The first experiment was a full on success.  I&#x27;m recommending this to all my friends.  In fact, I&#x27;m having my haircut appt today and taking this bottle of the L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Conditioner to the salon with me for them to use on my hair instead of their shampoo/conditioner salon products.  Why bother with whatever they have on hand when this is the best solution to maintain the color in my hair and not end up with a tangled mess.  Keep it coming and at such a wonderful price too.  Thanks Amazon &amp; L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
    <li> The smell of perfume is overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I think it made my hair drier than normal.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this cleansing conditioner for me. It cleans pretty good but I had to use 25 pumps to cleanse my shoulder length, curly hair. I didn&#x27;t even use it as a conditioner after that, I just used Suave because I didn&#x27;t want to use too much of the product the first time. Other than that it is a good product, with a few natural ingredients. Very nice scent and it has a good consistency, it it not too watery.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product wasn&#x27;t what i expected. I was excited to save few minutes in the morning but ultimately it just wasn&#x27;t worth it. My hair was oily and looked unwashed by late afternoon.</li>
    <li> This creme conditioner is very, very, very good. If you need to smooth your hair or deeply condition it, this will do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are two things that make me want to remove two stars: First, the smell is god awful, Second, the pump sucks worse than Wen&#x27;s bottles. You cannot get enough product out. If you have long hair, well, you will be pumping forever. Now, normally I would never deduct because of pain in the arse pumps, as it does make sense to just remove it, but the cleanser conditioner is too thick to easily get out of the bottle. And also, you don&#x27;t want to open the bottle because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again, but they gotta figure out the smell. Also, I think they should use a squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> Great. Nice, thick and creamy</li>
    <li> Product works well, but smells absolutely terrible (mix of burned plastic and something musky).  The smell lingers for days.  There are no useful instructions on this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it according to the instructions for the WEN products and that has worked well for me.  An additional pump applied as a leave in product after the final when your hair is sopping wet is the key for me.</li>
    <li> Have used a similar product for years made by Wen which is so much more expensive.  Tried this product about a year ago and could see no difference.  There are no sulfates and when you wash your hair, you feel like you are using a conditioner.  Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Really good product.  My hair is in much better shape using this than it was when I used shampoo and conditioner every other day.  It&#x27;s kinda weird not to get lather, but it works anyway.  I still use a clarifying shampoo once a week or so, and follow up with a deep conditioner.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s this product every other day.  Is working very well for me.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it left my hair greasy.  I read the reviews that said to try more and I did and then I had greasy and very frizzy hair...I tried a third time and then had to use lots of regular shampoo to get my hair clean.  The worst thing is it totally fried my hair...permeant frizzes, split ends..awful.  My hair dresser couldn&#x27;t believe it and I&#x27;ve had to get many inches cut off to even get it back to semi-normal.  I don&#x27;t know what is in this product...but it ruins your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I shared two bottles with my daughter and a friend and now they are every day users too!</li>
    <li> very nice product, great hydration, works great for frizz ...just wish the product came in a bigger bottle, It Is THICK, so don&#x27;t plan on using the pump....but does as its expected and overall worth it.</li>
    <li> I love wen and have tried all the wen products so when I saw this I was excited to try it because it is so much cheaper than wen. In my opinion this works almost as good as wen does!!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Used to use wen hair but to expensive.  So decided to try this one. It leaves hair shiny and managable. I have very long fine coloured hair. Also hubby&#x27;s hair looks great the best I&#x27;ve seen it look for a long time..</li>
    <li> As other reviewers said, it worked great at first.  Few times thereafter, hair felt gross and dirty.  Smell is a bit strong - vanilla-like, either love it or hate it.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve used Wen, Laura Rachel and Hair One. I like them all, but this one rocks. yes, you smell like a cross between a Pier One candle and a My Little Pony, but I got used to it. The formula goes in easily, feels every so slightly light (dare I say, foamy?), then rinses out and leaves hair soft and manageable. It is the fastest thing ever, one step! It is a steal at the price and I just wish they made bigger bottles. I do a deep condition once a week or so, as the moisture is a little less than the other brands.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at my local grocery store....kind of wish I checked amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper here. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 because it seems to have some kind of soap in it because you do get some suds. In my opinion a conditioner cleanser shouldn&#x27;t have suds it in because the whole point of a conditioner cleanser is not to have soap in it. I have been using salon graffix and figured I would try something new. With salon graffix there is no suds but I do have to do 2 applications to get my hair clean. This product is thicker in consistency with less perfume. With this product I only need 1 application but you really need to rub it into your hair because of how thick it is. it helps to run a light drizzle of water through your hair to help spread and lather the product. I still use a conditioner with this product because I love having a strong perfume smell in my hair when I am done.  I cant tell you what the results would be with using this product 100% on its own, however the way I&#x27;m using now leaves it shiny and smooth.  I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a better conditioner cleanser because I really don&#x27;t want suds.</li>
    <li> Cleansing conditioner is a great way to get clean hair without over-drying.  Shampoo strips out all of the natural oils, and conditioner is a poor substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every time I wash my hair. I have seen reduced breakage of my hair since I began using it several months ago. It&#x27;s best for thick, curly and coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be suitable for very fine, straight hair.  The conditioning ingredients may not rinse out adequately, leaving a greasy appearance.</li>
    <li> Overall, this product was just okay for me. I wanted to try a cleansing conditioner, and this one had pretty good reviews, so I went with it. The first thing I didn&#x27;t like was that a very small volume comes out per pump, so you have to pump at least 10 times to get enough of the product out of the bottle to apply to your whole scalp. It does have a chemical-ish smell in the shower, but once hair is clean and dry it leaves more of a perfume-like fragrance. It did soften my hair, but it did not fix my flyaway problem.</li>
    <li> My kids and I tried this and just couldnt stand the smell.  And it left out hair very sticky and not at all clean.  Do not buy this product</li>
    <li> Ok- I don&#x27;t get the negative comments on the smell. It doesn&#x27;t linger once you use it and its not that strong. What&#x27;s wrong with these reviews? Lets spell this out. It DOES lather, but a wee bit. When you add it to your hair, it will go on creamy. I love that it slides through my dry wavy/curly tresses. Then I add more to the scalp and add water. You feel it cleansing, but it is different. I leave it on, shower and wash my body, then come back and add water and mini lather again. I rinse and then proceed to style my hair. I use Garnier curl cream for my hair. I can&#x27;t explain how easy it was to style my hair. And.... It dried with volume, softness, shine, and bounce! My hair is noticeably more vibrant than before. As a note, I coconut oil deep condition a few times a week. Upon doing that, I use the ever creme shampoo to remove the deep oils. I plan on trying to use just the cleansing conditioner soon but haven&#x27;t mustered up the guts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, this stuff is amazing. People that claim it doesn&#x27;t work are not using it right and lathering it up the right way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 2 years.  I tried Wen at first but it was just to pricey,  this is much more reasonable and works great.  I used to have dry hair in the winter, no more!  I used to have to condition the heck out of my hair to even get a comb through it but now it is tangle free and silky.  Tips:  Use enough product, add a little water and message it around, leave it on while you finish your shower and then rinse well.</li>
    <li> smells aweful- is waxy and makes hair flop, worst loreal product ever made. sorry but true.</li>
    <li> Works great, wish it came in a bigger bottle with bigger pump though.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great...cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.  The packaging is poor (hope L&#x27;Oreal reads this).  The pump doesn&#x27;t do well because the product is so thick.  Need a better pump or thinner mixture.  And why they don&#x27;t sell it in a bigger bottle, is really kinda strange.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cleansing conditioner. I use it most of the times that I wash my hair, and it works great and smells amazing. You have to use a good amount of it, but that&#x27;s the same with all cleansing conditioners. If you use it as directed, your hair will be clean and not greasy or weighed down.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN for the last few years and was hoping for a replacement at a much more affordable price.  I have not had the same results although I am willing to try a few more times and will update my feedback if the results improve. Right now my hair feels heavy and dull after I use it.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have any chemical sensitivities, then maybe this product won&#x27;t give you any issues but if you do,  please stay away!&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the worst smelling product I&#x27;ve ever used.  It smells like burning metal with an old man&#x27;s musk cologne on top trying to cover it up.  It&#x27;s truly awful.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair several times to get the scent out but it just clung to it, even the next day, when I went to work my colleague asked me if I was trying a new perfume, when I told her what it was, she was glad I wouldn&#x27;t be using it again, because it was so horrible she didn&#x27;t want to have to smell it everyday!&lt;br /&gt; This product taught me a lesson, next time I&#x27;m going to look for something with more natural ingredients, which hopefully won&#x27;t give me an awful headache like this one did.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells, but it doesn&#x27;t do either job effectively any more.  When I first started using it, I loved it, but after a while it seems to build up or something, to where my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean OR conditioned!  I&#x27;m back to the old two step process again. I still use it here and there when I&#x27;m in a hurry, just to use it up.</li>
    <li> I love wen it&#x27;s the best product I have ever used. I am a licensed cosmetologist and I have always used professional products. I wanted to get the wen healthy, shiny, frizz free hair without the cost. I tried this and it is by far the worst product I ever used. The smell is ok but not my favorite. It&#x27;s almost like a rancid vanilla. My hair was dull, frizzy and left my curls flat after two uses. It feels like there is a buildup even thought I rinsed really good. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it acts as a great shave gel for your legs. It definitely moisturizers your skin. Just don&#x27;t use it on your hair. I will only use wen from now on. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading the nice reviews on Amazon.com, used it exactly as followed, and I felt as it left my hair feeling weighed down and robbed it from all its body. I discontinued using it.</li>
    <li> This product is just like Chaz Dean&#x27;s Wen Cleansing Conditioner. REMEMBER: this is NOT shampoo. It is used in place of shampoo and conditioner and if you don&#x27;t use enough of the product your hair will not be clean.  I have shoulder length/thick hair and I have to use a half cup of either product to have my hair come out clean. shiny and very soft.  I know that sounds like too much, but that&#x27;s what it takes.  Someone else decribed using too little as trying to clean a window with only one squirt of Windex and one papertowel.  That&#x27;s a really good analogy. Also, it is really important to soak your hair really well with water before putting the cleansing conditioner on.  If your hair isn&#x27;t wet enough the cleansing conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to soak in and get down to the scalp.  Wen cost $29.00 plus $6.22 shipping for a 16oz bottle.  This is about half that and it&#x27;s as good, or better.  I don&#x27;t feel as guilty buying it, so I enjoy it more.  Give it a try. Soak your hair in it then take a long bath. Start with twice as much as you think you need. Unlike shampoo, the longer it stays on the better your hair will look and feel.</li>
    <li> i had to go back to using regular shampoo and conditioner.  my hair was limp and it did not smell clean the following day.  This maybe subjective.  I am sure the others did not have the same experience i did.</li>
    <li> I read a post from a gal that explained this cannot be used like regular shampoo, you DO need to use an extra amount and really rub it through. BUT I LOVE IT. Smells great, not overpowering. My hair is in the best shape, and color is even improved.</li>
    <li> After spending a lot of money with several different shampoos that only dried my hair further, then switching to expensive cleansing conditioners that were gentle but just too costly (WEN, Deva Care, etc.), I finally found the best hair cleanser for the lowest price. I tell everyone about it. I just love it! Both the  Evercurl and the Evercreme are awesome!</li>
    <li> I think my curl pattern is 3b (tight, cork screw highly porous hair) I alternate between this and WEN. I feel like this gets my hair a little cleaner than WEN but WEN is a better leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Oreal gives my hair enough weight to give my curls some length without my hair feeling coated. It does have an underlying funky chemical smell however......</li>
    <li> this product runs circles around WEN.  Far far less expensive.  You lather and clean once (USE ENOUGH) no need like WEN to re-do after first wash.  Hair is so soft and sexy and smells marvelous...I will no longer be a WEN girl.  I highly recommend this product to color treated hair...my hair has never looked or felt better.  Great job L&#x27;Oreal keep up the good work and product....PLEASE DON&#x27;T DISCONTINUE!</li>
    <li> Love the product but hated the pump. Went to a couple stores and found a travel bottle for shampoo/conditioner. Took the top off the squeeze travel bottle and replaced the pump top with it. Now I can just squeeze out what I need! Works like a dream and only costs a couple of bucks.</li>
    <li> i used this trying to replace WEN. nope, didnt work. this is a good conditioner when used with shampoo, but thats not what i got it for,</li>
    <li> Very strong sweet smell. Product is very thick, and pump is kinda useless. If you have a big mop of thick curly hair like me, you&#x27;ll just unscrew it and squeeze the bottle. The bottle is VERY small and it takes a lot of product, as your hair may soak it up if its coarse and dry-ish like mine. Its not bad to have for a trip, as the bottle is small and you don&#x27;t need shampoo and conditioner. It seemed to clean my hair nicely and gave it plenty of slip to get the tangles out after I let it soak for a bit. Its not a bad product, but I feel like I can get a better deal with something else, as it takes so much for my hair. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell, as it lingered for a long time and was very sweet. Its kinda orange candy-ish. Its not bad, but I prefer more clean smells and don&#x27;t like hair stuff that competes with my perfume. It was so strong that my husband even noticed and asked me if I had put something different in my hair. (I use different stuff all the time, as I am always on a quest to find the perfect regimen for my curly hair, and he never notices.)</li>
    <li> My hair is soft shiny and had volume even though my hair is very fine this doesn&#x27;t weight it down! This is better than wen!</li>
    <li> Awful smell and it does not work the same as Wen. It smells like metal and my hair is not as silky as when I use Wen. I was hopeful it would be a game changer but it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service and delivery time were perfect from the seller.</li>
    <li> A co-worker of mine uses Wen and has raved about what&#x27;s it&#x27;s done for her hair. I can&#x27;t justify spending $35+ on shampoo, so I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and I love it! I wash my hair every other day and have a lot of fine, shoulder-length hair and I&#x27;ve found about 5-10 pumps does the trick. I leave it on for about 3-5 minutes in the shower and blow dry and style as ususal. My hair is smoother, softer and more glossy. My scalp is more hydrated and I don&#x27;t seem to be shedding as much. My co-workers have commented that I have more body in my hair as well.  After using this product, I would never consider buying Wen- not when I can buy this for a fraction of the cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Review Update**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3-4 weeks now.  I&#x27;ve found if you don&#x27;t use enough of this product, your hair will feel dirty.  But, once I&#x27;ve made sure to use enough, let it sit a minute or two, add a little water and massage, then rinse, my hair feels great!  Nice and clean!  My hair is soft (even my ends are soft!) and I have more body in my hair.</li>
    <li> For years I have been fighting with my perpetually wavy, frizzy thick hair to find something that will tame it. The first day I used it I used about 10 pumps and it left my hair feeling sticky and weighed down. (My hair goes just past my shoulders, maybe slightly longer.) But, after reading a few other reviews I thought that my problem might have been that I simply wasn&#x27;t using enough. So the second day I used 15 pumps which was enough to work it into a low lather as the directions say it should. (The first day it had not lathered at all.) This left my hair, literally, squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any advice to someone first using this product, is that if you feel it&#x27;s not working, then use enough to make it lather slightly as you&#x27;re probably not using enough. I needed a LOT more than I originally thought. With the price of the bottle, if I go through one bottle every three or four weeks I&#x27;m perfectly ok with it. Because I also noticed that in general I&#x27;ve had to use a lot less product in my hair, so the money I spend on this will definitely make in savings from buying all the other products I&#x27;d been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used Wen, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it compares to that. But, as a stand-alone product, for the price it works amazingly well. To compare this product to Wen is not really fair to L&#x27;Oreal. It&#x27;s like buying Scott&#x27;s toilet paper and being angry that it&#x27;s not as thick as Charmin. It&#x27;s an unfair comparison. For what it is, it works very well and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who constantly searches for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; hair product.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, just above the small of my back and read the reviews saying I would need at least 10-15 pumps so I just went right ahead and pumped away figuring I would go through it kind of fast but that&#x27;s the price you pays for long hair.  WRONG!  I rinsed for nearly five minutes under high pressure and still had to get back in the shower a half hour later to actually shampoo out the remainder and start over!  So if you&#x27;re coating your hair in it that way you&#x27;ll probably end up with build up and not being able to rinse your hair clean and I hated it based on that experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the areas that had rinsed clean felt like silk so I decided to keep trying it a little while longer.  Lo and behold my full head of extremely long hair takes all of five pumps.  I pump about three, lather it in my hands (virtually no suds since it&#x27;s low lather) with a little extra water to help it spread over my whole head and then two more pumps with some water to get it all the way down my back and a good thorough rinse after I let it sit for a few minutes.  And I mean thorough, I stand there waiting for the suds at my feet to disappear before I call it clean.  BUT THEN!  It&#x27;s heaven once I&#x27;m out of the shower. Clean, soft and smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a bottle of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s sulfate free shampoo on hand- just a dab to lather on my scalp and rinse through right before the cleansiing conditioner if I&#x27;ve got a lot of product or particularly dirty hair that day.  I use that once every week or two.  But other than that every 2-3 days it&#x27;s just me and the cleansing conditioner and I adore it.  My hair is soft and healthy and has a lot of extra body and wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Wen or any cleansing conditioners before so i can&#x27;t really compare, but only judge on the effect it had for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have long soft curly hair and although the product smells good and seems to be cleaning properly, it is nearly impossible for me to detangle my hair with this conditioner.  I used a lot, a little, tried to comb while letting it stand on my hair, tried to comb after, tried to run my fingers through, this product just does not help detangle my hair, unlike any conditioner i&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;After the same fight as when not using conditioner at all I get the comb to go through my hair, and the result is nice. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference with regular shampoo/conditioner though.</li>
    <li> This product works well, it gives you the lather you are so use to when washing with shampoo, but as stated it&#x27;s sulfate free, it smells wonderful, cleans good, doesn&#x27;t leave hair droopy or weigh it down. The only BUT, I have that it is a small thin bottle so you don&#x27;t really get a lot of product. Wished it was in a bigger bottle....Just as a side note, I have already tried, HairOne that it is a sulfate cleansing system as well, I liked it, it is fairly close to that, I also tried Wen, and that product  is good as well, but when your looking for something reasonable Wen is a bit pricey over time, HairOne not everyone carries it, but this L&#x27;oreal system is accesible even in the pharmacy and its not pricey.</li>
    <li> I have an oily scalp and this product cleaned my hair.  I also liked how soft my hair was while using this product.  The only reason I will not purchase this product again is the smell.  The smell is too strong.</li>
    <li> Great product. It has been Recommended by a few Hollywood stylists as an affordable cleansing conditioner. I definitely had my doubts as I usually prefer salon products but was pleasantly surprised! I also love that it&#x27;s sulfate free so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I plan on keeping this as a staple!</li>
    <li> I was having some dry scalp issues and decided to try this. It took my hair way to far in the opposite direction. My fiancee has 1&amp;#34; long hair and can use it without it looking too greasy, but still doesn&#x27;t like it. I use it for shaving cream so we can finish it and not waste the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what others are doing different, but this stuff did not work as promised. I have naturally curly thick hair, but living in CO tends to dry it out. I was so excited about this product until I used it. My hair felt straw dry, lifeless and frizzy beyond belief. I looked like the scarecrows ugly wild haired step-sister. Thankfully I had some of my old hair stuff still in the shower &amp; used that. Once I got out of the bath I still had to use an oil olive hair mask to fully repair the damage. Anyone looking to give their curls extra shine, softness and bounce...RUN THE OTHER WAY!</li>
    <li> It is ten times better then Wen, it smells so amazing and your hair will thank you after using it, I can&#x27;t find it in stores around by me so I order it here(thank God) and I will continue to use it in my hair care routine. Such a great price too compared to $30 from Wen.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend...I am so happy I gave it a try! My hair feels cleaner and healthier in the 5 months I have been using it, and my hair seems to have grown faster. The product also smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing conditioner.  I was skeptical of the cleansing and conditioning combined ability at first, but after using this product on my hair and my wife and daughter having used it I can say that I am a believer.  This will be one item that gets frequently purchased by my family.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful less pricey alternative to other more expensive cleasining conditioners out there like WEN or Deva Care,which are very great, albeit very expensive no lathering conditioning shampoos. This product contains NO drying detergents or heavy silcones...great for all people with \\&quot;textured\\&quot; hair or anyone concerned with preserving your precious color or highlights that we Beauty Gals spend so much money on....The idea is that No SLS (harsh detergents) won&#x27;t strip your hair and rough up your cuticle and strip your color. Basically, if you are a girl like me with longer hair that is thick and you color it...it is a God Send that will literally change your life. I have been using these types of products to wash my hair for almost two years now, (My sister in law is a hairdresser in GA and swears by them) and I will NEVER go back to regular shampoo. The exception is every month or so I use a clarifying shampoo to help remove styling gunk, etc, but a diligent hair person like me would do that anyway. This product is sooooo much cheaper than Wen or Deva Care.....with quality ingredients all from a DRUGSTORE! ( I am DEF a hair product SNOB and laugh at people that bought drugstore shampoos...but hey, for this ONE product, I wlll make an exception!) It smells yummy.. to me anyway..I have read mixed reviews on the smell from lots of reviews...it is kinda like a vanilla/Caramel/Brown sugar smell. A bit more perfumey than I am used to, but it still smells nice. My hubby commented that it smelled yummy, and he is picky on smells. OK so enough rambling.......here&#x27;s how to use it&lt;br /&gt;1. Remember, this is a product that does NOT lather. Think of it as using as using a moisturising cream cleanser for your hair (much as you might use for your face) vs using a harsh, drying soap (i.e. traditional latering shampoo)..it&#x27;s the same concept, and once you start with this type of product, you will be so pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;2. Make sure your hair is throughly wet. The only bad thing about this product is the pump...it dispenses WAY too little product per pump. Based on the thickness and length of your hair, you may need as little as 5 pumps, or, if you have long, thick wavy hair like mine that goes down to your mid back, you may need 12-20. I use about 12- 15...&lt;br /&gt;3. Start by working the product into and all the way around your scalp, moving the product down to the ends. Its a bit thicker than shampoo, of course, and it will take some getting used to, but keep working at it&lt;br /&gt;4. take as many pumps as you like to coat the ends of your hair. You will find as you get used to using this that when you do the final rinse, the product will run down into the ends of your hair cleaning and softening it, so this part you may not even want to do.&lt;br /&gt;5. take a few minutes and get on with your shower, shave, etc....&lt;br /&gt;6 after at least 3 minutes, add water to the scalp and hair, and continue to work it in a bit, (you will find this part easier than when you first applied it) then start to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;7. Rinse throughly....rinse!!&lt;br /&gt;8. Finish with a light conditioner if you wish. Fine haired, normal or un damaged textured people might skip this part all together....I personally use a light conditioner always.&lt;br /&gt;9. Dry your hair and style&lt;br /&gt;10. Enjoy your soft, manageable, gorgeous new hair!e only bad thing about this product is the pump...it dispenses WAY too little product per pump.

    <li> I have very dry hair in the winder and had been looking at the WEN hair conditioner cleansers, but they were so expensive so I thought I would try this.  This works really well on very dry hair.  If your hair is not extremely dry, not so much.  This is not something I can use every day, but only when I have a dry hair problem.  Then I use Pantene shampoo and conditioner until I get very dry again and then go back to this.  When I tried using this weekly I found it was a bit to much moisture and my hair would look greasy the next day.  So I recommend only using it with very dry hair and then using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and only using this occasionally.  I have shoulder length, straight, fine hair.</li>
    <li> makes your hair feel good.  i leave it on about 3 to 5 minutes then i wash it off.  i use it as a shampoo and conditioner and if you&lt;br /&gt;color your hair it works agaist fading that color out.</li>
    <li> Most drugstore brands tend to discontinue products that work well for me, so I hope to the beauty gods that Loreal keeps this one around. I had tried Hair One&#x27;s (sally&#x27;s beauty supply) cleansing conditioner and it irritated my scalp, giving me dry dandruff patch nodules which were as gross as they sound. I was turned off to cleansing conditioners after that, until last week when I saw this in Target. For some reason I bought it on a whim, even though I didn&#x27;t need any shampoo. Well, this is one impulse purchase I&#x27;m happy about because my fine, curly hair has never been happier. I wear it straight 24/7/365 and it dries out from the hot tools I use weekly. Plus winter is coming so it&#x27;s about to get even drier, but now I&#x27;m not worried because this stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic, works well to cleanse the hair, and it leaves my hair so soft &amp; hydrated yet still light and airy like I like it. I hate having weighed down hair! My hair is so hydrated that I was even able to curl it without heat, I just threw it up in a bun and slept on it. After taking the bun down I had Victoria&#x27;s Secret model waves omg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update after using it multiple times, but I just wanted to review it to let others with sensitive scalps know not to be afraid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-1-13: Been using this for a month now and I still love it! My hair is healthy and my scalp is fine. I do have to use more elbow grease when scrubbing my scalp but the trade off is okay by me. I bought a shampoo brush and use that to really exfoliate my scalp while washing. I definitely recommend this cleansing conditioner!</li>
    <li> I was alittle skeptical in purchasing this product, because I had never heard of a cleansing conditioner, other than a 2 in 1 product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think I have purchased L&#x27;Oreal products, but not haircare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also was worried how well this product would work with 1 part cleanser to 3 parts conditioner, whether my hair would feel clean or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have beyond thick hair, so their recommendation for normal hair is like 8 pumps, but I did 10 pumps, then added 2 more pumps, so that I could do my ends very well, but I started applying the product from my scalp on down, as per their video, which there is a tag that comes with this product, which shows you how to view the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did leave the product on for at least 5 minutes. I think they say 2 minutes, but what I always do is wash my hair first, then continue on with showering, which is what I did with this product, applied it to my hair, then continued on with my shower, then I rinsed it out.  I wanted to make sure I got the full effect from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found truly amazing is how easy it was for me to brush out my wet hair, without needing any kind of detangler, which I normally have to use something, so that I can brush out my wet hair more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did leave my hair smelling wonderful and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this product.  When you think about it, the cost is actually lower than if you purchased a separate shampoo, and then a separate conditioner, which is normally what I have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the next day after I used this product. I don&#x27;t need to shampoo everyday, and my hair still feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I, too, have used Wen on and off for about a year now, but stopped using it as a total-hair cleanser; rather, I use it as a conditioner for the middle/end of my hair after I wash JUST my oily scalp with shampoo.  Wen, for me, was too pricey to use in mass quantities and for my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this (L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme) after reading glowing reviews about how it&#x27;s more cost-effective than Wen.  I was ultimately very excited and almost opted to buy TWO bottles.  Thankfully I didn&#x27;t!  In the end, I didn&#x27;t find much \\&quot;benefit\\&quot; with the Evercreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme DOES lather.  It lathers LESS than traditional shampoo, but is nowhere near the type of consistency that Wen is.  If you&#x27;ve used Wen (especially for a whole-head conditioning shampoo use), you&#x27;ll find it difficult to \\&quot;go backwards\\&quot; and use this as a Wen substitute or replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to use the Evercreme as a conditioner ONLY (as I ultimately did with the Wen), but that was nearly impossible:  the end of my hair was NOT sufficiently conditioned and was much more flyaway, undoubtedly due to the lather.  You have to either go all or none:  so I had to use it to clean my scalp and massage less of it into the length of my hair and let it \\&quot;run through\\&quot; as it rinsed out.  Ultimately, you&#x27;re using a LOT of product (as you would with Wen).  It SEEMS like you&#x27;re saving a lot of money, but you&#x27;re not:  cheaper cost in a smaller bottle (that you use a LOT of), and with poor results that you&#x27;ll have to compensate with other products (i.e. leave-in conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I prefer Wen, it IS too costly for my finances right now...so back to my old Infusium 23 conditioner, which hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> My friend turned me on to this product. Very popular in the states and hopefully here in the UK. Great product especially for Brazial Blow Dry Treatment. Use alternatively to shampoo/Conditioner. This is a cleanser so it doesn&#x27;t get suds. It has conditioner in it. Rinse and blow dry like you normally do. Fantastic results. The company has quick delivery. Impressive.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic cleanser that conditions my hair without weighing it down. I probably won&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This is a game changer. I color my hair and find it always fades so quickly because I usually have to shampoo every day or so because I have fine hair that tends to get greasy. After using this I only have to wash my hair once or twice a week. It looks much shinier and healthy. Plus it feels super soft. I love it and will keep buying it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the pump top it dispenses a very small amount of the conditioner at a time so I have to pump it about ten times to get enough. Small worry but thought I would mention it.</li>
    <li> This product is reasonably priced and left my curly gray hair soft, shiny and thick-looking. But oh! the smell! Why oh why did L&#x27;Oreal find it necessary to add a cheap-perfume-type stench to this product? It surely isn&#x27;t a functional requirement. And the smell doesn&#x27;t fade - it lasts and lasts. Now that strong fragrances are frowned on and even forbidden in so many workplaces, even if I liked the scent myself I couldn&#x27;t go out in public smelling like this. L&#x27;Oreal is shooting itself in the foot - they ruined an excellent product by unnecessarily loading it up with nasty perfume.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY CLEANSING CONDITION PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT, I HAVE NOT USED SHAMPOO ON MY HAIR SINCE I RECIVED MY 1ST ORDER, YHIS IS WONDERFUL!!!!!! I RECIVED BOTH ORDERS THE VERY NEXT DAY, SO THANK YOU FOR THAT, IT ARRIVED IN PERFECT SHAPE, IT WAS PACED TO MAKE SURE IT DID NOT GET BROKEN</li>
    <li> I am a Wen user and am always looking for a more affordable alternative. I am going to give the fragrance an OK only because you either really like the smell or you hate it. I hate it but I got several compliments on how nice it smelled. The good, I used 8 squirts on my shoulder length hair (they are small pumps just over half the size of a squirt of Wen). It worked well, my hair was soft and looked great, almost as well as Wen. The bad, I have sensitive skin and it irritated it so I gave it to my daughter and she loves it so I will be getting her more.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin do not purchase this, but if not it would be a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The smell is amazing, and it does get my hair clean and leave it silky smooth. Because my hair gets oily easy, using only this I have to wash it daily. That is the only drawback. I&#x27;ve also found I like using it as a conditioner after shampooing. I love the combo of it with the L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Reconstruct Shampoo.But it on it&#x27;s own is great.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me. For some reason my hair looks like an oil slick after this.  I am not sure why, but it doesn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> The scent is overwhelming and it makes my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is awesome. Calms my fine hair without  weighing it down. Tried WEN and I like it but way overpriced. This is a fraction  the price and works amazing. Cant find in stores so i hope its not discontinued!!! Stocking up now!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had great ratings and some people even compared it to Wen. I wouldn&#x27;t go that far. It works ok. Definitely did not leave my hair feeling as clean as Wen.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She claims to love it, but I really do not like the smell at all. Meh.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff.  It cleans, detangles and leaves in moisture.  I have natural hair and it works well on my unruly, thick hair.  2 problems.  I can&#x27;t find it anymore in any of the stores that I shop in (Walmart &amp; Walgreens).  Also, I hate the pump bottle.  A jar would be easier to get all of the product out of and the pump do not work when it gets near the bottom.</li>
    <li> I rinsed my hair for ages and my hair was STILL super greasy afterwards. I am not new to cleansing conditioner. And this stuff is not great.  Also it smells pretty bad.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s account but I am writing a review. I read about co-washing online and decided to look for it on amazon. After reading the reviews I decided to order it. After only using it twice I was amazed. My hair is so much more shiny and less frizzy. Normally if I get a drop of water on my hair and it turns into a frizz ball but it was raining the other day and it was fine. The co wash also smells amazing. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the bottle is so small and its only available as an add on. I always hated my hair and now not so much. I just love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a much more affordable alternative to the other cleansing conditioner out there and it works very well for my wavy, brunette, coarse, Celtic hair.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of product that will get mixed reviews depending on your hair type. I have tried many 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner mixes in the past with terrible results so I was extremely hesitant to try this one. I&#x27;m glad I took the chance because I have now used it for 3 years and couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything else. My hair is thin and frizzy and has been treated with Keratin. Even if I have to wash my hair a lot, this makes it a lot easier for my hair to not get stripped of natural oils without leaving it greasy. If you&#x27;re not sure about it, at least give it a try, it&#x27;s 5 bucks so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a huge investment.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN products and like this as well.  It is a thicker consistency than WEN but it makes my hair soft and I will use it in between my other products.  I usually alternate hair products to avoid any build up.</li>
    <li> Terrible! Smells like plastic. Hair feels waxy.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair like crazy. So if this is you, you can give it a shot I guess. It does make your hair a little greasy so it can be less frizzy but it smells like concentrated flowers with bath and body works with honey.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My hair is soft and it seems like my natural curls show more than before. I like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews comparing it to Chaz Dean&#x27;s Wen cleansing conditioner, I decided to give L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s cleansing conditioner given its inexpensive price and because I had been interested in using a sulfate-free cleanser for a while. My first impression when using it was that the cleansing conditioner had a very strong scent which I personally did not enjoy. After washing my hair with it, I do have to admit my hair felt and looked great... but only for about four to six hours after washing. After that, my hair started looked greasy and was demanding another wash. I&#x27;ll settle for giving this product three stars because it did work (albeit a short time) and because I believe that this product would much better suit a person with naturally drier hair who could probably see the positive effects of washing with this for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again anytime soon just because I know that this cleansing conditioner in particular does not suit my hair at all, and I hope to find another sulfate-free cleansing product that will work better for me.</li>
    <li> The best at cleansing AND conditioning with out weighing hair down. Saves on time and smells delicious too! On my fifth bottle and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now.  It has improved the condition of my scalp and my hair. You do have to use a lot of it to become effective.  Do best to buy two bottles at once.  My main complaint is the pump.  The bottle should be an inverted squeeze bottle in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Once you get use to how it feels without the lather you&#x27;ll love it especially the way it gets your hair into great condition.  The great smell lasts all days.  I love this shampoo and it goes a long way despite the size.</li>
    <li> I used Wen for a few years and this is nothing like Wen.  I put it on and it was kinda foamy but not totally, almost like dye had been left on for too long foamy. When I rinsed my hair was not really cleaner, it had a film on it.  It wasn&#x27;t conditioned either...nearly squeaky save the film left over.  It just was a bad experience which is a shame because I trained my hair for washing once a week due to it&#x27;s length.  I actually got back in the shower and re washed with the biolage I had.  I&#x27;m disabled with limited mobility so it was really fun to take a second shower in the same day when one is enough for me to need a nap, seriously.  Oh and it smells like my great grandma&#x27;s senor living facility...not exactly the vibe I want to put out there despite enjoying jigsaw puzzles and insurance commercials.</li>
    <li> When I first noticed this product on Amazon I immediately wanted to try it. I ordered it and then once I received it I immediately used it on my hair. I didn&#x27;t like the pump on the bottle because it makes the conditioner hard to come out. I ended up have to use twenty pumps just to get the right amount of product out. Note my hair is barely shoulder length. After putting the product in and washing it out my hair was softer and more moisturized. Since my hair is dry and frizzy I decided to put it to the test by blow drying my hair. Instead of making my hair dry again and frizzy like what normally happens it made my hair soft and silky. Was very pleased. I absolutely love the smell of this product. It has a strong vanilla and caramel like smell that is amazing to me. In all honesty I still like Wen better cause it seemed to do more for my curly, dry, frizzy hair. I think though for the price I&#x27;d rather use this since it&#x27;s cheaper and still effective. I would recommend this product to anyone with very dry hair. It&#x27;s cheap and effective and good for ethnic hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this conditioner. I have thick curly shoulder length hair and use 8 pumps of this every night. It lasts exactly one month. Amazing results- no buildup, great hydration to my curls. I&#x27;ll never use shampoo again. HIGHLY recommended</li>
    <li> This product requires more to get same results and the smell is ordinary.  I think it is a good value and will continue to use it a couple of time each week.</li>
    <li> The first issue is there is no pump guide or directions on how much product to use.  The first time I used the product I didn&#x27;t get good results.  The second time I doubled the amount I used and got ok results.  Another problem is the fragrance.  I find it very unpleasant and it lingers in your hair all day.  At $6.00 for about 8oz not a particulary good value considering the amount of product you need to use. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Helps to smooth my coarse hair. I&#x27;ve tried many different products and this is one of the best even when compared to other similar products I&#x27;ve seen on TV.</li>
    <li> I read the the reviews on Amazon and was expecting something similar to WEN. It was NOT like WEN. This made my hair feel greasy. I wasn&#x27;t able to let it hair dry like I can with WEN.</li>
    <li> I loved this at first; my long, wavy, oily yet dry, fine hair seemed to soak it up and it looked healthier than I&#x27;d ever seen it. After using this for about 6 months, I got a haircut and my hair is now chin length. I can no longer use this product as it is just too heavy for my new hair length and for some reason it makes my hair super oily anytime I use it. I&#x27;m using it as directed but it leaves build up unless I use a separate shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing, this stuff is packaged in such a way that the bottom 25% of the bottle will be just conditioner without any of the cleansing agent in it and if you&#x27;re like me, that will leave a ton of oily gunk in your hair. It&#x27;s also incredibly difficult to get the last 25% of this cc out of the bottle, it&#x27;s thick and I had to scrape it out with a butter knife, kind of annoying. I&#x27;ve gone through 3 or 4 bottles of this and had the same experience each time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I buy maybe 4/5 bottles at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair so smooth, cleans well and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or makes my hair feels &amp;#34;eeky&amp;#34; like the Wen conditioner does.&lt;br /&gt;If you like the moisture the wen conditioner provides, you will also like this one. I always follow up with a conditioner though (herbal essences hello hydration) because hey, my hair is pretty dry and damaged; it can use all the help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried WEN so I can&#x27;t comment on the comparison. I am 38, and the reason I point that out is because hair changes with age. Women in their 30&#x27;s who color their hair can get dry, dull hair. I just started using the Cleansing Conditioner and my hair is super soft. I was afraid it might get flat and lifeless but it just looks amazing. The only other product I&#x27;ve used that makes my hair feel this awesome is Kerastase- and that is a very bold statement.</li>
    <li> I personally like the smell. I don&#x27;t think this is for anyone with fine hair such as mine. It made my hair greasy. I had a hard time running my fingers through my hair while wet. I have wavy/curly hair. My hair was also stringy and almost straight after this. I like my waves so not a plus. :) I am currently using this to shave my legs with.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough about this stuff!! Better and cheaper than Wen. I can actually get away with using just a bit coconut oil on my hair after showering. No heat styling needed! My hair actually stays decent looking. It is soft and manageable! This is the best my hair has behaved and I have tried EVERYTHING. Plus it&#x27;s vegan! I will be purchasing more and more!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the honey/vanilla smell of this cleansing conditioner by L&#x27;Oreal.  I&#x27;ve use Wen and I love it but I&#x27;m trying other brands to use in between.  This has the most amazing smell which lasts through the second day.  My hair is clean, soft and shiny when using this.  It doesn&#x27;t take as much to do the job as some of the cleansing conditioners.  The bottle is smaller but lasts as long for my chin length hair.  Give this a try if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to the fragrance.  I know most perfumes bother me but this doesn&#x27;t and I love the lingering smell. I&#x27;ll keep buying this!</li>
    <li> If I could give no stars I certainly would!! The absolute WORST smelling shampoo I have ever used. Like a lot of other reviewers I could not get past the cost of the Wen products, so I figured I would give this stuff a try. I like the L&#x27;oreal Everpure line....so I tried the Moisture system gold bottle. How can anyone think this smell is nice......dis-gus-ting!!!!!! I tried to get past the smell &#x27;cos my hair seemed okay with it. When that ran out I tried the blue bottle for curly hair...maybe it smells better, hard to believe but that one smells even worse. And to top it off I am pretty sure that this crap is the reason I am now suffering from a horrible rash that will not go away!!! Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this stuff. I will gladly pay the money for Wen if it smells better than this stuff which evidently is nothing more than a bottle filled with nasty chemicals. Wow I think the people who think this stuff smells good must live near sewage treatment plants or suffer from a loss of smell. It might make my hair look and feel fantastic...but I am covered in a rash and smell like a chemical waste dump. so no thank you!</li>
    <li> Leaves a waxy build up on hair.  Feels gross.  Cheap Perfume smell is really strong and lingers.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned thru to my scalp even though I tried to use a lot. The pump only pumps out very small amounts of shampoo so that I didn&#x27;t like as I was trying to get enough out to cover my shoulder length thin hair. For my husband though it works great bc he has such short hair and with the pump only squirting out a small amount I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll last longer for him. I went back to using the loreal moisture shampoo in the pink squeeze bottle and like it more. Then I use a leave in.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo, and far less expensive than the most known one. Leaves hair nice and silky and doesn&#x27;t  strip your hair color.</li>
    <li> I love this scent does what it promises</li>
    <li> The cleansing conditioner is great.  My hair is soft, clean, and it remains that way even if I cleanse and condition my hair every other day.  I have also noticed that my color has not started to fade as quickly as it did when I used traditional shampoo and conditioner for color-treated hair.  The fragrance does not bother me and it reminds me of some products I use to moisturize my skin.  I have given this product 3 stars because I don&#x27;t like the size of the bottle or the pump.  I have to use a lot of the product on my hair (it is long and fine, and I have a lot of hair), and the pump does not allow me to pump out enough product in just a few pumps.  I will continue to buy this product, and keep my fingers crossed that it becomes available in a larger bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be a very good alternative to the Wen products. I tried and tried to use them, but they not only left my hair terribly &amp;#34;disordered&amp;#34;, but also did not cleanse and burned my scalp! This product immediately worked, and I was left with perfectly cleansed hair and scalp, and did not have to use an additional cleanser. Very happy with this purchase and will repeat.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal must have improved the smell from the previous reviews listed from over a year ago - the smell is not intense or bothersome.  I love this product, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  I have definitely noticed an improvement in the texture and condition of my hair.  I highly recommend trying this product!!  I heeded the advice of some of the previous reviewers and have made sure to use enough of the product to thoroughly coat my hair, and I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
    <li> I am currently natural and was looking into pre-poo products for my 4B texture hair and was skeptical about buying products that wasnt for african american texture hair, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT....tried it the day I bought it and it worked great for my HAIR. I went back to the local convenient store and bought another one and a bottle of conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product, in my opinion is equal to the Wen products but way less. This system works very well, is gentle to your hair, and affordable.</li>
    <li> UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;My original review below is from almost exactly one year ago and I am still using this.  I am a daily hair washer and about once every two weeks do shampoo (I use CLEAR and condition with the cleansing conditioner) because I sometimes feel like there is a little bit of build-up (though this could be because I was in a hurry at the time of washing and just didn&#x27;t rinse thoroughly enough).  My hair has grown, there is minimal fallout all over the bathroom, and it&#x27;s so manageable.  For those of you who are looking for a quick fix, this probably isn&#x27;t it.  It took about two weeks of consistent use to feel and see the difference and a couple of months to see that my hair was growing like crazy.  It has to be rinsed completely...when you think you&#x27;ve rinsed enough, rinse some more.  Have patience and you will see what I see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive scalp that doesn&#x27;t agree with a lot of different shampoos and conditioners so I wanted to use this for a while so I could give a good review of the product.  It&#x27;s been 6 weeks and I could not be happier!  I have been flat-ironing my hair for years to the point that my natural wave turned into natural frizz but now the wave is back.  My hair is so soft and easy to manage and there is a lot less breakage and so much less of my hair falling out.  During the Christmas holidays I ran out of the stuff and kept forgetting in my rush to get everything done to pick up another bottle.  I had to use my normal shampoo and conditioner for three days which made my hair feel crunchy and horrible to manage.  I have no idea how I&#x27;ve gone all of these years without this!  I now buy a bottle every time I&#x27;m in any store that carries it just to make sure this never, ever happens again.  I just hope this stays around forever...I have bad luck with products that I grow to love being discontinued.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleansing conditioner. It does a great job and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy spot (like some of the others I have tried on Amazon). I found it to be as good or better than other products that are highly ranked and certainly much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Strong smell. Leaves my hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I know this will be a great product for other people, but it makes my hair very greasy. I&#x27;ve tried it multiple times and have rinsed my hair over and over to see if that was the issue. Without fail, my hair looks terrible every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my mom though- she has super curly hair and is excited to try this as she doesn&#x27;t use shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have loved all of the L&#x27;Oreal Ever--- products that I have tried, and this was simply my next to try. I was so excited to receive it, but it is truly awful. My hair feels dirty somehow, no matter how much I use. I have thick, curly/wavy hair, I imagine it might be acceptable for someone with thin hair, but for me, this line was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t finish the bottle. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing is the product smells decent.</li>
    <li> I was not very impressed with this product, but that&#x27;s because it is meant for normal to dry hair, and mine is more towards oily. I probably would recommended it to someone with very dry hair. Even so, after 1-3 washes with this, you definitely need to use a regular shampoo. I think that&#x27;s probably how it was meant to be used anyway.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something that compares with WEN, but not as costly as WEN.  I really like the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCreme Cleansing Conditioner, but not as much as the WEN.  I&#x27; m not keen on the fragrance and it does lather a little bit.  But for what I paid for it, I can&#x27;t complain.  You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth and it was still gentle on the color in my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is really frizzy and dry after using this product. I will not buy l&#x27;oreal conditioner again after using this one</li>
    <li> Love love this product. I like the smell of light vanilla, and how it leaves my hair silky smooth. I usually can go every other day on using it. But its gentle enough to use everyday. I have noticed my hair is not falling out as much as it use to.</li>
    <li> I have purple hair and this is one of the only products that doesn&#x27;t turn my entire shower into a purple waterfall. Even when I wash in warm water there is very little run off or fading of my color. The fragrance isn&#x27;t anything special and it takes a lot of pumps to get enough product out (I need about 15-20 pumps for my collarbone length hair) but the main advantage is that it doesn&#x27;t fade my fun colors when used a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I have tried Wen and actually preferred this product. My hair doesn&#x27;t need anything else to be silky, shiny, frizz free and smelling wonderfully. I tell all my friends. Best hair product ever!  I am 51 and have hair texture of a 25 year old.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells great and would use this over any of the conditioning cleanser&#x27;s on the market. Cheap and great.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, easy to manage hair. I wanted something with a bit more moisture for the summer, since the sun was drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to figure out why this has so many rave reviews- this still was nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t damage my hair like some other low end products have, but it left it pretty frizzy, puffy, dull, and covered in residue no matter how much I rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;Where are the silky locks all the other reviewers are going on and on about?</li>
    <li> I tried this product and Hair One. Hair One wins just because of the smell of this product. The scent was really strong while washing and did dissipate some but to me -- it smells someplace between a dusty dirty room and wet baby powder (aka - wet diapers!). After about 4 hours - I washed my hair again to get it out. It&#x27;s unfortunate it was so smelly - other than the smell, I liked the product better than Hair One. I haven&#x27;t tried Wen - because of price.</li>
    <li> I have average hair (medium length &amp; thickness) with some wave and a tendency to frizz.  I&#x27;ve been using this for much of the summer, washing with &#x27;regular-strength&#x27; shampoo and conditioner every few days.  It seems to have cut down on the summer frizz.  I like the convenience too -- one-stop-shampooing/conditioning.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a recommendation from  a friend who said it was like Wen. I did not care for it. I have long medium thick hair and it never really felt clean with this. Maybe would be better with shorter or thinner hair?</li>
    <li> To provide some background, I am korean and I have super thick and heavy hair and have damaged hair from overprocessing. I also was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, which makes my hair drier, brittle, and resistant to rehydrating (therefore any damage done NEVER gets any better). Sometimes I would even get tangle balls in my hair and I considered cutting my hair really short so that I could reset and restart my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many shampoos and conditioners. Some VERY expensive and sulfate free too but nothing really ever dramatically moisturized my hair until I tried this product.  Yes I did have to use around 15 pumps for my long thick hair and properly lather it. BUT IT WORKS!  There is definitely a noticeable difference in the condition of my hair. NO more tangles no more straw-like hair. It is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside to this product is the smell... I really dislike the smell of vanilla. it is kind of this overly sweet smell. HOwever, the smell only lasts in the shower and I don&#x27;t notice it after my hair dries. I also notice that I have to wash my hair at least every other day or it gets a bit oily, but after years of dry hair, I welcome that problem.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleansing conditioner. I had been reading up on all the hype of Wen and was considering trying it when I realized there are many other cleansing conditioners out there for much less than the price of Wen. I tried a sample Sally Beauty&#x27;s HairOne first and loved how it made my hair feel so much healthier than when using regular shampoo and conditioner (even the expensive salon brands!). The smell wasn&#x27;t the greatest though, so I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s version and I am in LOVE. This has a warm vanilla scent to it, different from other shampoos but I found it to be really pretty. It gives my hair so much shine without looking greasy or weighed down, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too soft and flat like most conditioners do. I am a hair product junkie and I can honestly say I will never go back to regular shampoo ever again! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the size of the bottle, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. I will go through this quickly because I use at least 10-15 pumps on my hair and then an additional 2-3 to re-condition the ends before I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to shampoo (I don&#x27;t like to use shampoo everyday, dries hair out too much).  I used Wen for a while but it got to be an expensive habit.  This is just the right amount of product, not too expensive, sulfate free.  Also has a pleasant, perfume-y scent.  I like the way my hair smells throughout the day when I use it.  This hasn&#x27;t replaced my normal shampoo regimen, it&#x27;s just for the days when I don&#x27;t want to use shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love Wen, but it was so expensive. This is a great alternative. It works just as well, has a pretty scent, and is way cheaper. I do miss the variety of fun scents from Wen though.</li>
    <li> Not quite like Wen - but works well.</li>
    <li> Love love love!  This is heaven in a bottle.  The smell is probably one of the most delightful scents I&#x27;ve ever had in a hair product.  It leaves my hair so soft and moist that I actually start to panic when my bottle is running low!  The price on amazon is pretty good, better than I&#x27;ve seen in other major stores.  As other users have said, you DO need to use a lot of product for this to work. I have a lot of hair, and I use about 15 pumps each time I wash my hair.  Your hair needs to be VERY VERY wet when you put it in.  After you work it in and massage your scalp, you might even want to dip your head in the shower stream again very quickly to add water - it helps work the product through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves your hair feeling soft and smelling amazing.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.  I only wish it came in a larger bottle!</li>
    <li> I like how the product works after I got over that there&#x27;s no lather. What I don&#x27;t like is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work great. You really have to push it down hard and all the way, not much comes out per pump, and with my shoulder length hair I need like 8 pumps. I also REALLY do not like the smell. Does not smell perfume-y. It makes my hair smell like I&#x27;ve been in a room with smokers. After using a different brand of styling product, I can mask the smell. But why buy a product where I have to? I&#x27;ll be looking for a different cleansing conditioner, hopefully one that&#x27;s a squeeze bottle and definitely something that smells pleasant.</li>
    <li> I had never tried a cleansing conditioner before.  I had heard both good and bad things about Wen.  For the price I wasn&#x27;t willing to chance whether or not I would be one of the few who didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;I found L&#x27;Oreal Evercream Cleansing Conditioner at Kmart on sale (BOGO) and got one bottle half off.  At that price I had nothing to lose.  One of my co-workers highly recommended this after I asked her about it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased I tried this.  It was worth every penny of the small amout I paid for it.  My hair is shiny, feels soft, and is much healthier.  The product smells very strong, but ends up smelling very good.  I really am glad I gave this a try.  I recommend it to anyone who is curious about Wen, but doesn&#x27;t want to pay Wen prices.  I will for sure repurchase.</li>
    <li> It smells good, your hair gets shiny and soft but it is not easy to work with. You have to use a lot in order to get the result! It is not worth the price!</li>
    <li> It does take a lot of product but even with that, it is still cheaper than WEN. Seems to do as good of a job. Have only used it 3 weeks though.</li>
    <li> I am a Cleansing Conditioner addict, and have been for about 7 years or so.  I have thin, fine, straight hair that is almost to my waist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with WEN, and loved it, but it is too crazy expensive. I have Hair One, and really like a couple of their varieties. But, I always like to try new stuff.  I absolutely LOVE Herbal Essences Naked cleansing conditioner!  It makes my hair soft and light and moisturized.  I also picked up some L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme Cleansing Conditioner at the drugstore.  This stuff is SO GROSS!  The scent is like a bad commercial perfume, and sticks with you all day, overpowering and clashing with any perfume you might decide to wear. Even though I used plenty (I know that Cleansing Conditioners usually take a lot to do the job), and rinsed like CRAZY, my hair when dried was matted, clumpy, and tangly.  I tried it a few different times, and ended up throwing almost half of the bottle in the garbage!  Nasty nasty stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I was having a hard time finding in some stores and was so thankful to find it on Amazon. If you have dry fine hair this stuff is great. I can use it 3 or 4 days in a row and then I will switch to a regular shampoo. This is fast to use and smells great. I get complements all the time about how good my hair smells. Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling this product!</li>
    <li> I had no problem with the product.  It did what it claims it does.  However, someone recommended using regular, inexpensive conditioner and I found it works just as well.  Every so often (once every two weeks or so) I just use a very small amount of shampoo on my roots only and then use the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving up shampoo.  My hair had become dull and lifeless.  This method completely changed my hair to shiny and full of body.  My hair no longer tangles which it used to do in the worst way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind spending the extra money this is a great alternative to the well known Wen brand which is even more expensive.  It&#x27;s simply not necessary and you get the same benefits with this product or with any store bought silicone free conditioner.  I use Suave... period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing I don&#x27;t love about cleansing with a conditioner.  There isn&#x27;t a downside.  I no longer need to cleanse my hair everyday.  If I need to style it, I wet it in the shower, otherwise I use a cap.  This also cuts down on using a damaging hair dryer.  (I very rarely use one - I let my hair air dry.)  I have no more itchy scalp... ever.  My hair is healthier than it&#x27;s ever been.  No tangles.  Less products, less money and a time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note - some people experience a transition period.  Mine was short, about a week.  I had to get used to not having lather and a squeak when I rinsed.  It was also a bit drab.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t let this stop me.  It&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
    <li> i always use Wen cleansing conditioners on my hair, but if i run out and am waiting on my order for a new bottle, this is a great substitute while i wait... def sulfate free... makes ur hair feel amazing, smells great... unfortunately its so damn hard to find this anywhere in stores (got lucky when i found them at a PX on Ft. Dix in NJ)... so now im always ordering on amazon, and with Prime, i get it in 2 days!! so happy &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt better! I have naturally thin, straight, oily hair. However, while my scalp is oily, my ends are dry and fried. I tried Hair One cleansing conditioner before, and it looked like I drenched my hair in vegetable oil AFTER the shower, so I was relieved to see this conditioner does lather somewhat. The lather is similar to the one in Not Your Mother&#x27;s Way to Grow shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my hair is thin and oily, I use about 15 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;1. I do about 10 pumps and rub in the top and back of my head, and then 5 more pumps and divide it and put it on the sides. Whatever is leftover on my hands, I rub on the ends of my hair. Make sure hair is fully saturated.&lt;br /&gt;2. Because the lather is so low, you will rip your hair out if you massage your hair too hard. Grab your head with your palms as if you would you grabbing a basket ball, and do very small circular motions. You will have a teeny bit of lather on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;3. Leave on your head for about 3 minutes. I use this time to shave.&lt;br /&gt;4. While rinsing, your hair will be smoother and your hair will become untangled. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;5. Because my hair is so dry I finish with Tresemme Repair conditioner in the red bottle. Always squeeze out excess water before adding conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;6. I don&#x27;t let the conditioner sit. I just rinse right away. The conditioner works so well, I don&#x27;t have to let it sit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair air dried so soft and silky. However, I have many cowlicks, so I still have to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not very strong and overwhelming. Many professional products have an odd smell (Matrix Biolage, Lee Stafford). My hair has the light scent of the Tresemee conditioner, but I cannot smell the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product cleaned my hair but caused a lot of hair to come out.  My hair looked nice and shiny but it didn&#x27;t budge or show any natural movement.  I may finish the bottle if I don&#x27;t continue to shed so much hair (but I&#x27;m not sure since I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m wearing a 1960s wig!)  Maybe good for some-just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The Cleansing Conditioner smells SO BAD. Smells like I&#x27;m putting toxic chemicals in my hair. I have straight, colored, medium thickness hair that&#x27;s about mid-back length. I&#x27;ve given the product about a month so that my scalp can adjust but my hair starts feeling really nappy and itchy after 2 straight days of use. Meh. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t really say whether this product works or not.  The first, and only time, I tried to use this, I was aware that I needed to use a lot of it.  So I put several pumps in my hand and worked it through one section, and repeated with other sections.  It definitely creates a very low sudsing effect so for those of you tempted to try co-washing with regular conditioner, I can say that this behaves differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experiment with this product ended here.  I hate sticky, sweet smells, and I actually prefer to use unscented or just lightly scented products.  Based on the reviews, I knew that I would either love or hate the smell of this product so I first did a sniff test before buying it.  The smell was really sweet, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be so strong.  By the time I rinsed this off in the shower, the smell had filled my bathroom to the point where I thought I was going to faint.  And I even had my window open because it was a hot day.  The smell was giving me a headache so I ended up shampooing and conditioning with my regular products.  The smell still lingered.  And I thought, well, that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m still in this bathroom.  However, even after I left the bathroom, the smell continued to attack me each time I moved my head.  Once my  hair dried, it was better, but by that time, the smell had lingered for so long that I had a full-on headache.  The next morning, when I showered, again, to get rid of the stink, the smell reactivated as soon as I wet my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I hate the smell of this anyway.  I hate vanilla scents because nothing vanilla scented ever smells natural.  This one smells like really cheap perfume that grandmothers wear.  It&#x27;s really overpowering and sweet and the smell seems to stick to you.  It&#x27;s like when you&#x27;re on an airplane and the passenger next to you smells like too much perfume.  Aside from my personal distaste towards this particular stink, it isn&#x27;t just that I don&#x27;t like this stinky scent.  Evenif this were lavender-scented or &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;-scented, or piney, or whatever, it would still be too strong.  This product suffers because it&#x27;s a really cloying smell, but on top of that, it&#x27;s really, really strong and lingers forever. I hate this smell, but if were at regular strength, I would be willing to use this if I thought the product worked well.  Unfortunately, this smell is at extra, extra strength so I can&#x27;t even test whether the product does anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> Product had a bad smell and was water thin. Not very good at all.</li>
    <li> Seems to dry out my hair. Darn!</li>
    <li> Once again, I tried this after using (and liking) Wen. These products have been doing a great job on my hair.</li>
    <li> Had to buy this after using my sister&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> From the other reviews you would think this smells like a yummy vanilla, caramel, brown sugar delight.  NOT SO!!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a stinky pine tree to me.&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty good - definitely not as good as WEN but then again they aren&#x27;t charging WEN prices so I will forgive a small lapse in quality and smell.  Like other users I have the problem of it being a bit greasy; I have naturally curly hair that I straight-iron and with this product I can&#x27;t go as long between washings before my hair looks/feels dirty.  Overall, I like (not love) the product and intend to use it periodically whenever I get fed up with the highway robbery that is the WEN subscription program.</li>
    <li> I love my hair after using cleansing conditioner, however it has a few cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) SMELL:( can&#x27;t stand it&lt;br /&gt;2) pretty small bottle comparing to other brands, used up fast&lt;br /&gt;3) to get a decent amount of the product ,you need to pump a few times, pump itself is pretty hard to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add that I have fine, middle length hair with oily roots (have to wash everyday) and very dry ends. Worried about my hair to be &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; after the conditioner but it&#x27;s not the case. Will continue to buy cleansing conditioner but probably will try another brand.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after using the Wen products. Wen was just too expensive for me. The L&#x27;Oreal smells a thousand times better and is much much cheaper. I have been using it exclusively for over a year and don&#x27;t see changing in the foreseeable future. I order it here on Amazon as an auto-delivery, and it is delivered to my house cheaper than picking it up at the local Wal-mart! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> In my quest to find the best and most affordable products to protect my hair, I’ve come across this awesome product! I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ve been using the wrong shampoo all my life and made the recent switch to sulfate-free which made a huge difference. But I wanted to go further. My scalp gets so oily that going a day without washing is out of the question. I’ve been wanting to try Wen, but the reality is – I just can’t justify spending that much money. So glad I found L’Oreal’s cleansing conditioner. One less product to use on my hair is a time and money saver. I love that it’s sulfate-free and really does cleanse and condition at the same time. Making the switch has worked wonders for my hair. I use it almost every day in place of shampoo and conditioner. But once a week I wash with a sulfate-free shampoo just to get rid of any buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I really didn’t like at first was the strong perfumy-smell, kind of like cocoa butter.  However, I have gotten compliments on it, people asking what perfume I’m wearing and saying that they love how I smell.</li>
    <li> To me shampoo is lathery and bubbly, but not this stuff. The only way for me to describe this shampoo is to say its like shampooing your hair with conditioner. I heard this is similar to the Wen products. I put a lot of product in my hair each day to control frizz and to define curl, so when I shampoo I want something to cleanse my hair and scalp from the products that are in there. I didn&#x27;t feel that this shampoo really cleaned my hair. I ended up combining this with my reg. shampoo so it didn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner on a regular basis.  It is pricey at the stores though.  This amazon bought item smells bad like it has spoiled.  I used it anyway (silly me) and my head was incredibly itchy.  This problem continued until I stopped using it and bought a new one from my local store.  Liquid items are often discounted for a reason..... my guess is that it sat somewhere a long time or was exposed to poor elements.</li>
    <li> I have used the other more expensive conditioning shampoos and had to come back to this product. More expensive is not necessarily better.  Love the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> So really I have looked at Wen but didnt end up trying it due to the cost, so I cant compare with any other cleansing conditioner. I workout nearly every day, so therefore I have to wash my hair often. Getting sick of the results with shampoo and conditioner, I thought I should try the no Poo thingy.  So far I have only used this product 3 times. Leaves my hair very soft and shiny. I need about 6 to 7 squirts. I have thin just above shoulder hair. My hair has become greasy as of lateley so I am hoping that this product will help with that once my hair adjusts. So far so good I am really happy with it. Regarding the smell that a lot of people are complaining about, obviously my sence of smell is not as great as other people, but really I dont think there is anything wrong with it. In regards to the packaging, a lot of people dont like the pump, look, again I pump 6-7 times. No big deal here... I call it finger excercise</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me, it left my hair limp and greasy no matter how I tried it</li>
    <li> We used WEN and after a few months of the expense, you start looking around for other options that are more affordable.  This is okay, especially if you don&#x27;t have any high end needs or issues with your hair.  Loreal makes dependable products and this was a great price, so it was worth giving it a try.  I like to change up my hair products also, so this is worth trying if you&#x27;re looking--remember this will not be a sudsy foamy shampoo, it will be like WEN, you put it in your hair and let it seep in!  It isn&#x27;t exactly but it costs 1/6 the price of WEN.</li>
    <li> Works great! Didn&#x27;t really want to spend the money on the Wen products, but my hair is soft. The key is getting a good amount of this product evenly on your hair, and RINSING! If you can master that this product may be for you. It does not lather like traditional shampoo, but rather like slathering on plain ol conditioner. But, I have to say, my hair was soft, not greasy, and felt like I had actually used regular shampoo. I love this stuff, and the price is perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more affordable option than WEN.  This didn&#x27;t work for me.  It wasn&#x27;t any cheaper and it just didn&#x27;t work as well.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell and I felt like I needed to use more.  I have long hair and it only gave me about 3 uses which is a week&#x27;s worth of washing.  When I did the math, WEN was more affordable and I just loved it so much more.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry hair! I use this a couple times a week and my hair is always so soft after. You have to use a lot of product though and really work it in. I wish they sold it in a bigger size!</li>
    <li> okay so I was worried before I bought this because people said the scent was disgusting, but it smells VERY similar to britney spears fantasy perfume and I love that perfume so I LOVE the scent of this. its hard to describe but its like sweet-ish but not. Like candy but alittle more oomph to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use this when I found out about it because ive been wanting to try wen for YEARS but refuse to do that auto renewal program without even knowing if I like a product, Alittle about my hair type, IT is very dry but not damaged just naturally very dry. And thick and curly on the bottom of my head and the back like above the neck and the rest is really wavy. Normally if I shampooed more then twice a week my hair would get sooo dry, I used 3 different conditioners in the shower after shampooing. plus a leave in conditioner and some hair oils on my ends after it dried ( remember dry hair but not damaged ) It also tangled crazy crazy bad. Honestly one time I forgot to wash my hair for like 2 weeks cause it never got oily and I forgot when the last time I washed it was LOL I say this because if you have normal, fine, oily hair my review is not going to be helpful for you. This is for the dry girls with tangly hair who wanna know if this is for them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so the first time I used this, I wanted to blow dry my hair to se what it was like( when I blow dryed my hair after a regular washing it would be the driest frizz ball)well it was seeming pretty dry to me which turned me off so I just put it in a bun, however the next morning I took it down to brush it and It was SO soft, not frizzy at all, my curls and waves were defined and beautiful, my scalp didnt itch. ALL I used was this product. Remember I was using 3 different condiioners in the shower before and even after all that my hair never felt as good as it did after ONE use of this. I tried it again and again and everytime the results have been the same. AMAZING smelling hydrated hair!! now I will say a few things about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent* As I said above think Britney spears Fantasy and it lingers in your hair. Everytime you use this product your hair will smell like it until you wash with something els. but I love it so I dont mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;texture* It is a very thick conditioner texture and I use a generous amount in my hair like I always did with shampoo and my other conditioners nothing new here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cleansing ability* I will say that I used ALOT of hair oil on my hair before the first time I used this and my hair was oily from that but after I washed it it wasnt oily at all it was just soft and amazing. so for my needs this is cleansing enough. HOWEVER let me just say that every 2 weeks I will be using a regular shampoo to make sure I dont get any build up. I think thats a very important step even if you use wen. YOU need a good regular shampooing aleast once a month to start over and keep the results of the cleansing conditioner stay amazing and not get heavy and oily. You dont want to block your hair follicles with build up either as that can lead to hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;conditioning ability* AMAZING this conditions my hair better then my carols daughter, nexxus, Nixon ect ect ct all very good conditioners but this blows them all away. my hair has never felt better after getting out of the shower without a ton of leave in product! I want to dye my hair and I feel like with this product I can without becomming even drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall* I absolutely love this and cannot believe I paid 5$ for it like that is CRAZY to me, It replaces my shampoo ( except for once every 2 weeks) my conditioner and my leave in conditioner and im used to spending a minimum of 15 on each so this is going to save me ALOT of money and is going to be PERFECT for the gym to wash the sweat out of my hair without drying it out beyond repair.  I am VERY happy with this product but I can see how it would be too much for some people. and the scent does linger in your hairso if you hate the smell I doubt you&#x60;ll like this.so if you hate the smell I doubt you&#x60;ll like this.</li>
    <li> I only use this as conditioner and not as shampoo, because I find that my scalp is too oily to use combination products. That said, this is one of my favorite conditioners. It leaves my hair with good volume, and I have fine hair. For people who do not have problems using combination products, this may work very well for both shampoo and conditioner. Especially considering the price, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I usually buy WEN and have been using WEN for over 2 years now. I wanted to try this and see if I could find something easier to buy and of course cheaper. Not the case as I&#x27;m unhappy to say. The worst thing about this product was the smell! It was so awful I couldn&#x27;t sleep well the couple times I used it. It made my nose plug up as I&#x27;m sensitive to strong smells. It had such a strong chemical smell as I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it? I hated it that I gave it to my sister who was the one who started me on WEN. She said she didn&#x27;t mind the &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and told me she was surprised it lathered so much compared to WEN that she questioned if it was truly comparable to WEN. I guess she didn&#x27;t like it enough as I never seen her buy it on her own after I gave her my 2 bottles. I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product to say It was a good buy or that I liked or recommend it. The smell alone will have me saying to stay away. I when back to WEN for all my needs as it&#x27;s my hair cleanser and leave in hair product and no need to buy anything else for me hair.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I use this for a few days and then switch back to my regular shampoo so that my hair color lasts longer. If I use it all the time my hair does end up looking greasy though.</li>
    <li> not the best out there</li>
    <li> as a woman on the go, and expected to be deployable at a moments notice, I need products that multitask.&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair which is highlighted and processed and this product helps it feel soft and makes it easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, recommend. I still need serum to tame the flyaways but then again, what woman doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is in my &amp;#34;go kit&amp;#34; ready for immediate deployment in case I find myself called to duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this if you have a water softener in your house. This product works best in medium hard to hard water.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise you will be rinsing, and rinsing, and rinsing and rinsing.....</li>
    <li> I was seriously afraid that I was going to be stung by bees because of the smell of this product. It&#x27;s like putting vanilla pudding in your hair and overpowered everything in your day!</li>
    <li> This is the most awful smelling stuff I have ever purchased.  Even though Wen cost a heck of a lot more, at least you won&#x27;t smell like a dead skunk that rolled in vanilla!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now. It can be hard to find in the store so I&#x27;m happy Amazon carries it. My hair is generally healthy but it is color processed (every 6 weeks) and highlighted (every 3 months). I use regular (sulfate free) shampoo once per week, followed by a deep conditioner. Every other day I use this product. I think it is similar to Wen (which I haven&#x27;t used), but I think my hair is very healthy, thanks to this product. I use about 8-10 pumps for my shoulder length hair. It detangles and smoothes. It does not get foamy so you have to get used to it, but my hair is very clean and shiny. It might take you a week or so to get used to it (your hair may seem heavy or greasy for a few days), but over time this is a great product</li>
    <li> Wow, I hate to give a L&#x27;Oreal product a bad review. I LOVE their sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. The hair balm is also really awesome.  I was very excited about trying the cleansing conditioner and planned to use it for at least a month before making a judgment call on how it affected my hair.  But as it turns out, I could only use it ONCE. The smell is just overpowering.  And don&#x27;t get me wrong -- it smells nice.  But imagine your favorite perfume.  Now imagine pouring a whole bottle of it onto your body and not bathing for 24 hours.  That&#x27;s what using this product is like.  It&#x27;s a very very heavy perfume that will withstand all rinses.  I liked the smell at first but was sick of it within a few hours.  Please please please L&#x27;Oreal:  Make a cleansing conditioner without all the perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the effect on my hair other than the smell:  My hair was pretty limp and dead-looking after I used it.  But that was only ONE usage, and maybe it would have gotten a lot better after consistent usage for a while.  But there was just no way I could tolerate the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who do use this product regularly:  Please don&#x27;t wear any perfume!  You&#x27;ll give someone out there an asthma attack.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair which can be very dry. I stopped using heat on my hair and wanted to stop using shampoo and conditioner and all the sulfates and silicones that are present in so many hair products.  WEN products are waaaay to expensive for me, so I did some research and found this L&#x27;Oreal product.  I absolutely love this product! It lasts a good amount of time (apply just to your scalp, not necessary to apply it to your whole head).  I wash my hair every morning (I know that&#x27;s a no-no but it&#x27;s something I just can&#x27;t not do) and use a semi-permanent color, and this co-wash preserves my color for a good 6 weeks and leaves my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> Worst EVER! It leaves my hair GREASIER than before my shower, and it smells like something died. I was using this for a week, and when my friends came over, they asked if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in ages! So embarrassing!</li>
    <li> It has a very strong smell, is VERY thick, and did nothing whatsoever to clean my hair. I use it as a deep conditioner from time to time, but for cleaning my hair it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have thick, fine, barely wavy hair and I only wash my hair 2x per week ordinarily.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo, works great without drying out your hair in 1 simple step</li>
    <li> Works very well. Takes a little getting used to the no lather. Has a heavy perfume sent but isn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair soft if it all doesn&#x27;t fall out. I had to rewash my hair with shampoo to stop it from coming out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it in lieu of shampoo and conditioner for over a year. It gets my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t build cause a waxy build up like the Herbal Essences conditioning cleanser. After a few weeks of using it my hair becomes unbelievably soft.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why all these reviews compare this stuff to Wen. This conditioner is OK, but it&#x27;s NOT WEN or anything special. I&#x27;m starting to wonder about the validity of amazon reviews on products like the one. It DOES have a terrible smell, but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle, but I would not buy again with the same expectations.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed especially after reading all of the reviews about shiny, silky hair and wonderful smell. I truly wonder if they were using the same product I did. The smell is so offensive I had to wash my hair over again. I bought this product from Amazon after getting an email directly from L&#x27;Oreal touting this as the great, new product that required no other conditioner with the largest words being a testimonial about how silky and shiny it made one user&#x27;s hair. Those sounded perfect for me--so I went to my favorite shopping place--Amazon--and bought it. Not only would I never use it again nor give it to anyone as I wouldn&#x27;t even want to be around someone whose hair smells like this stuff, when I called L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s customer service just now I was grilled with questions then the gal said, \\&quot;Well, didn&#x27;t you use another conditioner with it?\\&quot; As the entire ad campaign explicitly says not to use another conditioner--that seemed odd. She then asked how long my hair was and when I told her it was shoulder length, she said that was another reason I wouldn&#x27;t get the promised results, which made no sense to me. It seems to have completely stripped my hair of its shine and has that kind of feeling you get if you use dry shampoo and don&#x27;t get it all out though I rinsed this out liberally. Even so, the person sitting next to me at a lunch meeting today who I know well actually said she could smell the odd \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; smell emanating from my hair, which I had just washed with this one hour before--even after a second shampooing with a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, if I could give this zero stars I would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen,loved it but was disgusted with the price and the fact that I couldin&#x27;t go to a local store to get it,always having to order it was a pain in the butt. I then found Hair One. It was just as good as Wen but I could find it in my somewhat \\&quot;local\\&quot; Sallys&#x27; store and it was half the price of Wen.I&#x27;m always looking for new cheaper hair products that work as good as the super expensive ones do. Walking through my local walmart I finally found the best of all worlds. When I saw the L&#x27;Oreal bottle I bought one just to try,I mean at under $6 you can&#x27;t go wrong,right? Well I love this product so much I went back the next day and bought 2 more bottles cause I don&#x27;t EVER want to run out! Goodbye Wen,goodbye Hair One I&#x27;ve found a new love and it&#x27;s called L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner.Everyone has different hair,mine being thick and wavy,but if you give this a chance I belive you&#x27;ll love it to :]&lt;br /&gt; Sep 13th 2012--I&#x27;m updating my original reveiw to let you know my feelings on the product a few months later.&lt;br /&gt; I still love L&#x27;oreal cleansing conditioner however i&#x27;ve found myself going back to Sallys to buy my Hair One again. I use it on the days I don&#x27;t use the L&#x27;oreal and at least once a week I use a clarifying shampoo bacause I feel any of the cleansing conditioners can weigh your hair down after awhile.&lt;br /&gt; I do now think the other cleansers i&#x27;ve mentioned may condition my hair alittle better but honestly there isin&#x27;t a huge diffrence. I still use the product and will continue to do so.I just want anyone thinking about buying this to have the most honest reveiw I can give. I appreciate when other people do and I usually buy products according to others reviews. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now. Was thrilled when it came up in Amazon subscribe and save. For less than $5, it is paraben and sulfate free. I use it on my toddlers long long hair, we get sweaky clean and tangle free results.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t get a lot of this product and you have to use quite a bit to get your hair clean. On top of that, the smell is too strong and clings to your hair throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I tried this new product a month ago L&#x27;Oreal® EverCréme(tm) Cleansing Conditioner. I have to say that the product is EVERY BIT as good as WEN® and maybe better at 1/2 the price (0.75¢ per oz. verses $1.87 per oz. Average)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is advertised as a &#x27;Cleansing Conditioner&#x27; but it does contain a &#x27;Surfactant&#x27; (Sodium Cocoamphopropionate) however, this is a Very Mild, Non-Sulfate Foamer with conditioning properties so it should leave hair cleaner feeling (And It Does) than WEN®&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does NOT contain Silicone which has proven to be Both a Blessing And A Curse in recent years due mostly to the beauty industry practice of overdoing a good thing by putting it in every product (Shampoo, Conditioner, Setting /Styling, Hairspray) and WEN® contains many known and potential irritants (Basil Oil, Menthol and Rosemary Oil) which are not in EverCreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And EverCreme&#x27;s Fragrance is very nice (Vanilla, Floral, Warm, Spicy) but a little too sweet and clingy for my taste. As for how it worked, my hair is the &#x27;Three C&#x27;s&#x27; (Coarse, Curly, Colored) and this left my hair VERY soft, smooth and moist - a little too much for me as I like my hair to feel cleaner and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, this is just my personal preference the product performs beautifully just not to my liking. Most people don&#x27;t make the distinction between what they like their hair to look like and how the product performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So people who need extra smooth and moist hair or can&#x27;t seem to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave their hair too dry and tangly should give this a try.</li>
    <li> I still love Wen Sweet Almond Mint best, but this is a close 2nd and I&#x27;m not willing to spend the $$$ on Wen.  The only difference is the smell (L&#x27;Oreal is VERY floral, not the fresh smell of Wen SAM) and there is no reassuring &#x27;tingling&#x27; like you get from the mint in Wen.  Hair One is terrible--I&#x27;d rather use regular shampoo and conditioner than that.  And Salon Graffix is very, very good, too--close to Wen in terms of results but the fragrance is unbearable.  I&#x27;m stocking up on L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme!</li>
    <li> I have been getting Keratin treatments for my otherwise unruly blonde-turning grey hair since Aug 2011.  I have to be careful NOT to use anything with sulfates or sodium chloride to make the treatment last.  I was awaiting a late shipment (from an Amazon seller :( ) for my professional shampoo/conditioner but since the shipment was running late i had to pick up something in the meantime.  I ended going to Target and found the Evercreme cleansing conditioner...I&#x27;ve always believed we as a society wash our hair too much and use too harsh of products on it...so this appealed to me.  Read the ingredients and thought this would suffice.  I also picked up the Organix Awapuhi Dry Styling oil to tame fly away hair (that will be a separate review).  First off I LOVE THE SMELL!!!!  Love, love, love it.  Low sudsing, but that doesn&#x27;t matter, sudsing just means harsher detergents.  I followed the instructions and after reading reviews used a minimal amount for my below shoulder length hair.  The result for my almost 50yo hair...fabulous!  Shiny, soft, healthy feeling.  I was in AWE!!!  I can&#x27;t stop touching my own hair.  I did put the Organix dry oil on the ends and my hair is sensational.  Thank you L&#x27;Oreal for getting this one right.</li>
    <li> I used Wen several years ago, but I thought it was way too expensive so I started using the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate-free shampoos and I&#x27;ve been very happy with them. I decided to try this product, planning to use it every other day in place of regular shampoo or when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I think the results are great. My hair is clean and conditioned. I don&#x27;t know how the results would be if I JUST used this product, but it is good they way I&#x27;m using it. I already see a difference in my dry hair. It&#x27;s also a great product for the gym, or traveling because you only need the one bottle.</li>
    <li> If you want beautiful hair, look no further. This is the most amazing product to hit amazon and drugstore shelves. Not only does it smell heavenly (seriously, it smells like Victoria&#x27;s Secret Heavenly perfume), it actually does what it claims to do. It has a thick, creamy consistency like most conditioners do with a light lather to actually cleanse your hair. Use the product generously - meaning 1 or 2 pumps is not going to work. 5 or 6 works best! I focus the lather near my scalp and roots and carry the rest to my ends. Wait about  2 minutes, rinse, and you&#x27;re prefect. (2 minutes gives you time to shave and wash your body -I think of it as multi-tasking!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wen is amazing, but why spend $35 for 16 oz. of product? While only 8oz, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Cleansing Conditioner is still a steal at only $6! If you buy 2, you&#x27;ve got 16 oz with still less than half the price of Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, color-treated hair and after only one use I am writing this review. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or flat as volume is something I struggle with. This will remind you of the hair you had as a child - soft and pretty. I will never go back to using regular shampoos with harsh sulfates. Plus eliminate shower clutter of a million products! L&#x27;Oreal is genius and I can&#x27;t wait to see long-term effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER HAVE ANOTHER BAD HAIR DAY.&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;DO IT.&lt;br /&gt;NOW.</li>
    <li> The shipping and description of item was accurate but the quality of the product I found to be lacking. Left my hair greasy and oily. Didn&#x27;t do a good job at all.</li>
    <li> awful, nothing like wen.I have used half of the bottle, using lots to little.Leaves a weird horrible dirty feel to it.</li>
    <li> The scent is truly disgusting.  I have no idea how anyone could say it smells like vanilla.  I don&#x27;t know what it smells like, but it&#x27;s rank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not work as well as my WEN which is very disappointing.  I hate how much WEN costs.  My hair still felt dry and strawlike after I used this Loreal stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair product hoarder/junkie.  If I could add up what I&#x27;ve spent on products I&#x27;d probably be sick.  Anyway, I was curious about the no-shampoo routine touted on the internet and after some research, I went with this product because of the price and the good reviews.  I wasn&#x27;t buying Wen because it&#x27;s outrageously expensive and I am wary of getting locked into monthly shipping requirements.  I have somewhat-straight, past my shoulders, and I color every 5 weeks and I straighten it.  It gets oily at the roots so I wash it every other day.  Needless to say, I&#x27;ve damaged the &amp;#*@ out of it.  Wow, I am so impressed with this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a week and 1) my hair has stopped falling out in the shower and when I blow dry--I was losing so much I thought I had thyroid problems 2) it is so soft and clean, even at the roots 3) it&#x27;s not stripping my color.  I recommend taking the pump off of the bottle and just gouping it out in your hand--the pump is obnoxious, it takes forever to get enough out to wash long hair.  Definitely spend a couple minutes working to the scalp and the ends, add a tiny bit of water, and let it sit while you finish showering. Warning: I have found that adding certain leave-in conditioners afterward can make your hair feel a bit gooey and weird.  Use this product alone the first couple of times to see if you like it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am also using &#x27;As I am&#x27; co-wash cleansing conditioner &amp; I am so confused on which one I love the most. I love them both for very different reasons. The &#x27;As I am&#x27; feels like butter on your hair as soon as I put it in my hair it feels like my hair is really getting a treat &amp; also feels clean. With Loreal cleansing conditioner I get that low poo &amp; it feels so good its like nothing I ever put in my hair before. Its important with the Loreal that you really wet your hair to get that low lather going. With both products I sometimes use it twice meaning I would wash with it rinse it out &amp; reapply. Thats also important to think about. When you were using regular shampoo if you felt like your hair was extra dirty did you just wash it once??? If I thought my hair was extra dirty I would wash it twice sometimes three times when I would use regular shampoo. (I only use regular shampoo once a week). Its just something to maybe think about. I will continue to buy Loreal evercreme cleansing conditioner as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> In a money saving effort, I ordered the new L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner in place of my usual Wen product...and what a disappointment.  The product itself worked okay, although I don&#x27;t think my hair was as shiny or felt quite as clean as it does with Wen.  But oh my GAWD!  This stuff smells HORRIBLE!  It&#x27;s overwhelming, strong and reminded me of old-timey public bathroom wall fresheners.  I almost retched the first time I used it...and then afterwards, the smell remained so strong on my hair, that I constantly smelled it between shampoos!  I don&#x27;t understand why any company would think that we want our HAIR smell to announce our arrival...Forget using perfume with it - it would be the terrible clash of scents.&lt;br /&gt;Wen&#x27;s products have natural, botanical scents that are very pleasant and that don&#x27;t cling unpleasantly to your hair after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered more Wen and almost did a jig of relief when it arrived!  The difference in the two products is huge.&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, I am not convinced the money savings is that great compared to WEN - you have to use a generous amount of both products, but I was having to use MORE of the L&#x27;Oreal product to get the same desired coverage as I get with WEN.&lt;br /&gt;More power to L&#x27;Oreal for trying coming up with a product to compete with Wen...but they need to TOTALLY go back to the laboratory on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005HIH7YM L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, 8.3 Fluid Ounce]][[ASIN:B005HIH7YM L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, 8.3 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I love what this product does for my hair. In my opinion, it works better than Wen. It conditions as well as Wen, and it keeps my roots from getting greasy longer than Wen. BUT... and this is a big but... The scent of it is so strong and perfume-y that I just cannot use it. I have never been sensitive to smells before. In fact, this is the only beauty product that&#x27;s got a smell that&#x27;s prevented me from using it. But it is SO strong that it makes me nauseous. So, buyer beware, if you have any sensitivity to perfume-y scents at all, try something else instead. If they made this product with any other scent, I&#x27;d never try anything else!</li>
    <li> wow i am impressed with this product and want on auto delivery.  i have short hair and use 3 pumps to cleanse and three pumps to condition.  my hair is high lift blond and USE  TO BE DULL AND NO BODY.  well not now.  i love this stuff so do not even think about it just buy it</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I was curious about Wen, but did not want to pay the money. I really wanted this to work, but found my fine color treated hair to be extremely dry afterward I was not able to comb it at all. I had to apply big amount of leave-in conditioner to be able to comb it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner!  Sulfate-free is much gentler on my color-treated hair.  I can comb right through my hair after washing.  My only complaint about this product is the packaging.  It takes way too long to pump out enough of the shampoo as it is very thick and you do have to use a larger quantity than a typical shampoo.  I would prefer a squeeze tube or bottle.</li>
    <li> I used wen for years and was tired of not liking any of the scents and the crazy high cost. I tried this and love it. I love that it has a tiny bit of lather to it so I can use a little less then what I used of wen. I love the smell, its like vanilla and musk, but then again I love the smell of Ojon so maybe that&#x27;s why I like this and most don&#x27;t. I still have to use a ton because I have thick, long hair so a bottle only lasts about two weeks but I would go through a 32oz bottle of wen in a month so this is by far cheaper. I think they leave my hair feeling the same. The only difference I notice is my hair felt a little healthier with wen but nothing drastically over what this does. The pump on these bottles is so stupid and annoying that I use my old wen bottles with this in it. The pump produces about an inch of product at a time and since I use about a handful it was really annoying. I still use shampoo once a week and use a masque/extra conditioner every three days because this is simply not enough but neither was wen. I would never use either for a leave in because I have super sensitive skin and would break out so I cant say if that works the same. All and all its a better deal then wen with a nicer fragrance. If you like floral scents you wont like this, if you like sweet scents like pink sugar this is great.</li>
    <li> I have a prof cosmetology license and go to the Prof Only Beauty Supply stores a few times per week.  I am accumulated a huge collection of shampoos and conditioners, I would guess at least 200!  I can go to the beauty supply store and buy any Salon Only Shampoo (Redken, Goldwell, Chi ect) for the same price, if not less than the Loreal EverCreme and I STILL always go back to the EverCreme...It&#x27;s THAT good!  I have mid-back length, super thick wavy hair that I bleach or color at least 2x a month, sometimes every week! This shampoo is so rich it really helps out my fried hair.  It smells like a Givenchy perfume I used to wear abt 5 yrs ago...mmm..I love it!  It&#x27;s also super versitle, if you have thick unruly hair, add a bit of hair oil (argan or coconut work for me) the night before or 10 min before washing to really soften and reduce friction THEN  deep condition AFTER using the shampoo..PURE TAMED SILK!  If you have fine hair, just use the shampoo, no conditioner and you will have bouncy soft hair...and it cuts out a sep. conditioner...really, I have tons of shampoos that sell for over $20 in the salon and the one closest to my heart, my true favorite, the best performing is EverCreme.  I&#x27;ve gotten everyone I know hooked on it!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a product junkie i suppose you can say..i only wish they sold it by the liter!&lt;br /&gt;this generation of sulfate-free readily available hair products are&lt;br /&gt;really amazing and wonderful.  i use this product with the deep nourishing mask or my deva curl one even though you&lt;br /&gt;may not need to condition..i like to since i have curly colored hair..i would say per naturallycurly dot com a 3A type...&lt;br /&gt;i can say this..you don&#x27;t need much and it has a nice mild lather to it and the smell&lt;br /&gt;is really nice ..lite coconut smell + a hint of tropical flare i guess. it feels rich rich rich...i don&#x27;t get tangles&lt;br /&gt;after wash/use. i always use a leave-in conditioner after my final rinse.  my hair has never been so healthy since i&#x27;ve been on the sulfate free path.&lt;br /&gt;try it you may just enjoy it... really nice and the packaging is lovely/this one comes with its own pump.&lt;br /&gt;since it&#x27;s sulfate free(low poo i could say)..proper use would be to cleanse/scrub the scalp with your fingers in circular motions and then run the product down to the ends. my sister tried a no poo and said she felt dirty...but she did&#x27;nt scrub her scalp! so scrub away...&lt;br /&gt;you can see the video at the loreal website and all their other sulfate free goodies which may help you to determine what product you&lt;br /&gt;should buy.</li>
    <li> I have thin, wavy-curly hair, and I have to be very careful about what products I use. I need a balance between clean &amp; fresh and anti-frizz, without weighing down my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not used to being shampoo-free, do a little research first. Many of the poor reviews I saw for this product were due to people&#x27;s misconceptions about what it is or how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cleansing conditioner. It does a great job of cleansing the hair and scalp without the harsh detergents found in shampoos, while also leaving hair soft and manageable. It is NOT a shampoo! It has the slightest but of lather, but not much. It&#x27;s not supposed to. Lather is not indicitave of cleansing power. Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll get through the lather addiction with time. Stick with it. It&#x27;s worth it! Again, this is not a shampoo, so if you use heavy product, especially products with silicone, it won&#x27;t be able to dissolve the silicone. Go silicone-free, and this will work like a dream. Or, if you aren&#x27;t ready to go completely shampoo- or silicone-free, use this in-between shampoos as a conditioner. It took me a while to get used to being shampoo-free. Stick with it! Remember that your scalp will initially rebel- it will likely become more oily for a couple of weeks until it adjusts to not having to over-produce natural oils that were getting stripped by your shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just as clean as when I used shampoo (I used to shampoo daily! So bad for my hair), but it is soft and less frizzy. I don&#x27;t even need a separate conditioner. For cleansing and conditioning, I like it even better than the much more expensive DevaCurl No-Poo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love the effects of this product, I really hate the smell.  It smells like a super-fake vanilla.  Not clean at all, and way too artificial.  It&#x27;s also a very strong scent.  Nauseating, in fact.  I bought almond essential oil to add to it to cover the smell.  It helps a little, but I wish it had a fresh, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the packaging is terrible.  This ultra-rich formula comes with a pump (to be reminiscent of WEN, I am sure).  It&#x27;s very inefficient.  The product is just too thick to come out of the pump correctly (and I&#x27;ve been through several bottles of this).  It would work so much better in a tube.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a week ago and couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing my hair looked after the first wash.  I figured it was a fluke and it would look worse as it built up in my hair over the course of the week.  I was wrong.  This stuff gives my very fine, thin hair bounce and body like I have never had before with any shampoo and it feels like silk.  For what it is worth...it does make a difference how many pumps you use.  I used 13 squirts (they are small squirts) the first several times and tried to drop to 8 once and noticed a huge difference as my hair seemed drier and not as bouncy.  I went back to 13 and my hair was perfect. I would think those with thicker or longer hair would need 20-30 squirts to get the same effect as my short, fine hair. With my old shampoo&#x27;s, the brush would snag and pull and catch as I was sytling...now the round brush I use with the blowdryer just glides thru my silky hair and adds bounce as it was always suppose to do. I have the reverse angle cut and in the Florida humid summer, it looks flat and lifeless and has a mind of its own on the fine front corners by my jaw.  With this shampoo, it stays perfect all day.  I tried doing my hair with one of my old shampoos yesterday and cannot believe how crappy my hair looked.  When I get home, I am throwing everything else out but the Loreal Cleansing Conditioner.  I always wanted to try the Wen line but I am waaay to cheap to get hooked on a $30.00 a month shampoo....so glad I waited for the Loreal to come out instead.</li>
    <li> I have hard to manage hair. It&#x27;s thick, dry, wavy, frizzy, and I can never tame it, unless I flat iron it. I&#x27;ve tried SO many products to get my hair to look better, but nothing has ever really made a significant difference. Then I tried Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, and I&#x27;m in love. The first time I tried it, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching and smelling my hair. It was so soft, silky and smelled heavenly! I really love that the scent stays in my hair for a long time, not like other shampoos that smell great as long as your hair is still wet, but then the scent is gone as soon as your hair is dry. Not this stuff! I wash my hair every other day, and when it&#x27;s time to wash, my hair still smells super clean! My hair looks so good, I feel like I should be in one of those commercials where the models swish their hair and it falls like silk! Evercreme has transformed my hair, thank you L&#x27;Oreal!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading reviews, hoping it might replace Wen, which works for me, but is very expensive and difficult to buy other than on-line. I have nearly waist-length, thick, dark blond hair, and need to be careful about anything that might dry out the ends since I want to preserve the length. This product cleaned as well as Wen, but did not condition well at all. My hair was frizzy and flyaway, especially on top, even though I blew it dry (which I try not to do). I ended up having to add a leave-in conditioner, which I do not have to do with Wen. I recommend this product as a shampoo alternative, because it smells lovely and does a good job cleansing the hair, but you will likely need a separate conditioner as well. I&#x27;ll keep it for cleansing when my Wen runs out, but despite the much more affordable price tag and yummy vanilla fragrance, can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair look and feel. But the smell is overpowering and gives me a headache. I tossed the bottle after using twice. I just can&#x27;t deal with the smell.</li>
    <li> have curly dry bleached blond hair. the product does a great job so far at hydration and keeping color. didn&#x27;t care for wen. seemed to make my blond dingy and gray/green looking. so far, loreal cleansing conditioner keeps color pretty and bright.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a six weeks on my shoulder length, straight, fine, color treated, 46 year old hair.  I just love it!  My hair has never been so soft and shiny.  My color does not fade and I love the smell!  I tried Hair One and did not car for it, it dried my hair out.  The Evercreme makes my hair feel soft and silky.  I used to use leave in conditioner but I don&#x27;t need it anymore, in fact, my hair looks better without it.  I absolutely love this product and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have very curly,  somewhat frizzy course hair about to the length of my mid back.  This works very well on my hair type and leaves it soft and clean. The smell is awesome and stays in my hair for a while.  I can&#x27;t say I recommend it since everyones hair is different.  My sister tried it and she did not care for it as much. Her hair is thinner and straighter then mine.  She did love the smell though.  She prefers Wen, I prefer this one.  To each their own, you just have to try it for yourself to see what works for you.  It is a cream like conditioner, but cleans your hair.  I still use a leave in conditioner for my hair or gel depending on what I am going to do with my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or anything, their is nothing like that to it.  It has the consistency of a hair conditioner.  You do have to use a lot though, depending on the length of your hair.  Either way you have to use a generous amount.</li>
    <li> Have to use a lot to get your hair clean</li>
    <li> This crème cleanser is very effective with keeping my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  It is not regular shampoo, so you might need some practice (like you would with Wen), in order to really use it the right way.  I flip my head over and let the water run on the back of my head and really saturate my hair (I find this is the best way for me to use this product).  Next, I put a few pumps (you will figure out how much you need eventually) in my hand and start with the first section (the front of my head).  I gently massage the cleanser on my scalp until a low lather develops.  Then I continue this method throughout my whole head.  I also add a few splashes of water to create an effective lather.  If you don&#x27;t use enough water then it will not work correctly.  After I have a nice low lather, I finger comb or use a wide tooth comb to distribute the product to the rest of my hair.  Then I clip my hair up and let it sit while I wash my body.  This type of cleanser does take work, but once you get the hang of it, you will be very satisfied with the results.  I&#x27;m sure YouTube has instructional videos if you are unsure of how to apply the product.  It is very similar to Wen, although I find that Wen is the best cleanser for hair EVER, although very expensive!  This is a close second!  I have long fine hair and a very oily scalp (I have to wash my hair everyday or else I have a grease slick!) and this product does not leave my hair greasy.  My ends are dry too when I use traditional shampoos, but when I use this cleanser, my ends blow out so nice and my hair doesn&#x27;t separate as much or look straggly.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> The smell is kind of weird (an earthy smell) but I co-washed my clip in extensions with this conditioner and it left my extensions nice, soft, silky, and full of life!</li>
    <li> I have &#x27;sort of thick&#x27; shoulder-length hair that tends to get dry from coloring and blow drying.  I was looking for something like the Chaz Dean &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; hair care and so I tried this as soon as I could.  The quantity is pretty meager and the pump only dispenses a very small amount with each depression.... but you only need a little of the product so I guess this would cut down on waste.  I have to use about six or seven pumps of product on my hair, but maybe someone with shorter thinner hair would only need one or two pumps.  I am on my third bottle now and I think my hair is responding well. its much less dry and very soft now.  Any user of this product HAS to be ready to think of it as a cleanser - NOT a full blown shampoo... there is virtually NO lather at all.  Rub it into your hair with a little water rub it in for about a minute and rinse it out - dont let it sit on your hair too long before rinsing - I think it leaves your hair TOO heavy if you leave it on a long time.  When its dry, your hair will be slightly heavier than you are probably accustomed to, but that&#x27;s probably not a bad thing for most of us!  ;-D  I also use DermOrganic Argan Oil leave-in treatment on my hair almost every day before I blow dry or use my curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try Wen for over a year but the cost deterred me.  When L&#x27;Oreal came out with their mass market (aka Affordable) version, I thought the time was right to try it.  Since I have never used Wen, I cannot say how it compares.  My hair is medium length, about 5 inches past my shoulders.  I color it monthly and style it daily with a curling iron and hairspray.  It has become very dry and rough in texture over the years of doing this, despite babying it with color care products and intensive leave-in treatments.  I shower at night so I haven&#x27;t tried this product with a blow-out and can&#x27;t comment on how it works. I would say my hair is normal or perhaps slightly on the fine side.  Hopefully this information will help you to know if my review my be applicable to you.  I have been using the product for a week now.  What HASN&#x27;T changed is that my hair looks and feels exactly the same when it air dries: frizzy and rough. My hair was definitely not transformed into something ready to wear.  What HAS changed is that it is now much, much easier to style.  It holds my style so much better now, even in wind.  I have been able to use half the amount of hairspray as I was before.  It also looks more vibrant, like the color has been enriched.  I still see color in the soap suds (I dye my hair red) but I always did even with so-called color safe products.  The suds are always a bit pink or peach.  So some color is still coming out with this.  Although my hair is dry, I tend to get oily on the scalp if I skip a shampoo.  Not so with this!  My hair still seems just-washed on day two.  I have also noticed that I am not scratching anymore.  I used to scratch all the time.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I do have a dry and sensitive scalp. This product seems to have eliminated that issue.  I also have noticed that I am losing a LOT less hair in the shower and when brushing.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the vanilla scent.  I hate that particular scent in personal care products, but it&#x27;s only really noticeable while my hair is wet.  Once dry, I can&#x27;t tell.  I just wish manufacturers would leave sent out of their products for people who have allergies or people who want their own perfume to be their scent and not clash with personal care product scents.  Although the bottle doesn&#x27;t say how to use it, I read on the L&#x27;Oreal site that customers were recommending 8-10 pumps massaged into the hair and scalp and left to sit for 5-8 minutes.  I have found with my hair length and texture that I need 10-12 pumps which I massage thorough and then comb through and let sit.  I leave it on long enough to wash my body and face and then rinse.  I don&#x27;t feel any residue although I choose to partially rinse in order to leave a bit in as a protective seal.  On the days I fully rinsed, my hair felt like it needed conditioner.  So that&#x27;s my long review and I hope it helps!</li>
    <li> I will buy this again, This product smells so good, and I have actually gotten a lot of complements on the smell. I love the fact that it tames my fuzz issues and I seem to have an easier time styling my hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this. I love Loreal products, just didn&#x27;t work and the smell is awful</li>
    <li> Love this....can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work well for me. But I have very long hair; It made my hair feel really weighed down... and...it smelled like plastic (:  maybe it was a bad batch...?</li>
    <li> I learned about this product one day a year ago when a very friendly young woman started up a conversation at the grocery store. she didn&#x27;t really introduce this line of L&#x27;Oreal products to me but she did get me thinking when she said that she loves the conditioner that comes in the at home hair coloring boxes, and she wished that she could purchase it. at the time i had just at home colored my virgin hair and was having regrets to how soft and manageable my hair used to be before i colored it. she recommended a product called \\&quot;cholesterol\\&quot; from Sally&#x27;s Beauty. I gave it a try but felt like it didn&#x27;t really do much for me except weigh my hair down. I strolled around the ethnic section at my local Walgreen and picked up a olive oil deep treatment, it worked a little better but didn&#x27;t do too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, fast forward 6 months and i decided that i was tired of having the ombre hair from my grown out roots so i went to CVS on a spur of the moment and picked up the only color that matched my natural shade which happened to be L&#x27;Oreal Preference well the color match was perfect but what wowed me was the after color conditioner. when i went back to CVS I saw that L&#x27;Oreal had a line of shampoos conditioners, leave in conditioners, and masks using the infamous Camelina oil that the after color conditioner has. so I bought the whole line of products and have not looked back. my hair is stronger, it has more shine and although it is damaged due to coloring and so it isn&#x27;t as manageable as my virgin hair used to be it is still a lot more manageable now than when i used other hair care products. when i see a sale of the Preference hair color i pick up several boxes and then just toss the dye and keep the after color conditioner (it really is the best deep conditioner out there)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, in my quest for a product to help bring my hair back from horrible damage i tried the Wen sweet almond and absolutely hated it. first of all the instructions said to use 8-10 pumps, that was so much product that i felt the 6 oz bottle would have only lasted me a week! now i don&#x27;t know about others but my hair is super oily at the roots on the second day (I wash my hair every 2-3 days and use a dry shampoo on my roots also i don&#x27;t use any styling or heat products) well i washed my hair in the morning with wen tried to let it air dry throughout the day but by noon my hair was embarrassingly greasy looking! not only did it look like i hadn&#x27;t showered in a week but it also looked like i poured a bottle of oil on my hair! it was the worst hair day of my life. I have never been so mad at a product before until i tried the Wen. i did however find another use for it as a mosquito repellent...mps, that was so much product that i felt the 6 oz bottle would have only lasted me a week! now i don&#x27;t know about others but my hair is super oily at the roots on the second day (I wash my hair every 2-3 days and use a dry shampoo on my roots also i don&#x27;t use any styling or heat products) well i washed my hair in the morning with wen tried to let it air dry throughout the day but by noon my hair was embarrassingly greasy looking! not only did it look like i hadn&#x27;t showered in a week but it also looked like i poured a bottle of oil on my hair! it was the worst hair day of my life. I have never been so mad at a product before until i tried the Wen. i did however find another use for it as a mosquito repellent...</li>
    <li> It does a good job but I find the scent overwhelming. My husband wants me to switch because he keeps smelling it. I will switch.&lt;br /&gt;I like Nuema moisturizing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am very glad I discovered this.  I switch off with regular shampoo and my hair does not have as many fly-aways.  I have somewhat  fine hair of medium thickness with a little body/wave.  My daughter also uses it.  She has thin, curly hair, and it keeps it from getting flat.  Not good for greasy hair or after a sweaty workout.</li>
    <li> So I ended up picking this up from a store, but I had to write a review. (It&#x27;s cheaper here though, if you have Prime!)  I LOVE Wen conditioner, but my wallet does not. I read that this was a great dupe from a few different reviewers and was happy to try an actual affordable product. So first thing first- smell. It&#x27;s important because I&#x27;ve tried other dupes (cleansing conditioners) but some of them smell awful. I&#x27;m looking at you Salon Grafix! It has a chemical smell that never disappears, even when my hair is drying.&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal smells amazing. It is vanilla-ish, with a hint of something else I can&#x27;t put my finger on. It&#x27;s not a natural smell by any means, but it&#x27;s not overpowering, and to me at least, it doesn&#x27;t give off a chemical smell. This particular one is made for drier hair types, but can be used for all. My hair gets greasy about every other day, if I use something harsh on my scalp, it seems to get oily faster. Ever since I&#x27;ve used cleansing conditioners, my scalp and hair have improved greatly. I used this by itself, and it kept my hair feeling clean, and my scalp and hair feel neither oily nor dry. Thought I&#x27;d add that it feels heavy when its wet, but when it dries, it has great slip and just looks very nice. Although there&#x27;s a lot of dupes out there to try, I would give this one a shot. L&#x27;Oreal does have one other cleansing conditioner in its line, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I have heard good things. Hope this helped :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new shampoo that was sulfate free and would nourish my hair. The reviews seemed great, so I figured I would order this and give it a try. I loved it after the first use but decided to wait until I used it longer before reviewing the product (to make sure it held up). Well, almost two months later, I am still in love! This shampoo makes my hair really soft and smooth, really helps with fly aways and leaves my hair shiny and never oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned after reading reviews about the amount needed to shampoo, but I have had no problems. My hair is to my shoulders, and I use about 8 pumps per washing. I was afraid that that would make me go through the bottle too fast but I still have a little left in the bottle after 7 weeks of washing about every other day (sometimes every 3rd).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong, and does last a full day after washing, but I love the smell and have gotten many compliments about the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This is perfect for my thick, straight hair. It smells great and leaves my hair silky smooth without being oily.</li>
    <li> I buy my wen from a certain home shopping network and its about four times more expensive than this. However, loreal ever cream stinks like a lot of other people said. It smells like a cheap vanilla little girls perfume. Sickeningly sweet. Sure its a moisturizing substitute, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair strong or bouncy or as healthy as wen. If you compare ingredients wen has many more moisturizing, strengthening, good for your hair ingredients. So if you just want a regular conditioner, get loreal. If you want one with a lot of beneficial ingredients for your hair, get wen. Its WAY worth the price in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I recently received some sample packets of Wen in the lavender scent and fell in love.  However, when I saw that it was a little over $30 for 32 ounces, I was deterred from buying it, especially because when I researched it I saw that according to my hair length and type, I should be using about 24 pumps of the product every time.  That is a lot!  So after doing some research on amazon and reading a lot of reviews, I decided to try this product.  I purchased this at my local Wal-Mart for $5.99.  However, mine had an extra 2 ounce travel size, so I actually got 10.3 ounces for $5.99 which is a steal compared to Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I go into detail about what I liked, and did not like, and compare it to when.  I think it is important to mention my hair.  I have below shoulder length hair (3-4 inches below the shoulder) that has some natural wave.  My hair is extremely coarse, unruly, etc.  The product line I use normally is called Organix.  For the past 2 years I have used their Moroccan Oil line exclusively, and have noticed a big difference in my hair.  I should also mention that some of the problems with my hair are resulting from nutritional deficiencies I have from gastric bypass surgery 4 years ago.  I get split ends easily, and if I do not get my hair regularly trimmed, I will have to have large amounts of hair cut off because it is damaged.  The last time I lost 4 inches.  My hair also comes out in clumps regularly in the shower due to this and the fact that it is so thick/coarse.  My typical routine is to use the Organix Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner or deep conditioner, blow out cream, and Moroccan Oil for coarse hair.  Note that I only wash my hair 2-3 times weekly due to it&#x27;s dryness and texture or it would be pretty bad.  Some of my hair breakage may be caused by my perpetual ponytail.  I do sometimes flat iron it, and it looks great, but I teach kids who are disabled, and have to be up and down, around, and chasing them down sometimes, hence the ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. DIRECTIONS&lt;br /&gt;Loreal: The directions say to use a quarter size amount of the product.  Okay, this was not an option for me due to my hair type and length.  I have bangs and a quarter size amount would cover my bangs maybe and nothing else.  I opened the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; 2 ounce travel size that came with the full-size bottle, and I felt like I had used a little over half, maybe 1.25 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;WEN: I really liked that the directions say how much to used for what kind of hair type you have, as well as length.  I think this would be really helpful.  I also really like that the Wen website has more detailed directions about dividing your hair into sections when applying, using a wide tooth comb, and even an instructional video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. SCENT&lt;br /&gt;Loreal: I know a lot of people in the reviews complained about the scent.  Honestly, I did not notice that the scent was either good or bad.  It did not bother me either way.  HOWEVER, my 11 year old daughter, had to use the bathroom when I was using the product and asked me , &amp;#34;What smells like rotten eggs?&amp;#34;, and she insisted that my hair smelled bad after I had blow dried it, even though I could not smell it.  I think some people might be more sensitive to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;WEN:  I had the lavender, and I really liked the scent at first.  However if you have dry hair like me, and leave it set in your hair as suggested, the medicinal aspects of the lavender caused my eyes to tingle.  The smell stays on you for a long time and well linger in the bathroom.  The next morning, however, I did not notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. THE PRODUCT DIFFERENCES&lt;br /&gt;It is very important to note that Loreal is a LOW LATHER cleansing conditioner, but Wen is a NO LATHER cleansing conditioner.  They are BOTH cleansing conditioner, but there is a big difference.  When I used Wen, I did not feel like I was putting shampoo on my hair.  There was no lather, no pull on my hair, nofriction.  I was stunned that I did not lose ANY (not 1) hair when I used Wen, but that my hair still felt clean and deep conditioned at the same time.  When I first put the Loreal cleansing conditioner into my hands, it felt like conditioner, like Wen.  But when you put it in your hair and work it in, you see that there are suds.  I was very disappointed when this happened.  After I towed dried, I could barely comb through my hair and had to use my daughter&#x27;s detangler.  When using both products, I followed through with the rest of my hair care routine as usual, however when using the Loreal cleansing conditioner, after blow drying, my hair felt very dry and straw-like, as if I hadn&#x27;t conditioned at all.  I had to add extra Moroccan oil to my hair, but it still did not look or feel right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I think that this product is probably a good shampoo, and I would feel okay using it as a shampoo if followed by my Organix Moroccan Oil deep conditioner.  But for me this is not a stand alone product for cleaning and conditioning hair.</li>
    <li> I recently started transitioning to CO-ing (conditioner only) my hair.  I started using this every day, and was able to go 7 days without using shampoo on my scalp.  Next, I was able to go 11 days without shampoo.  I have read reviews where shedding has increased from using this product, so I began counting shed hairs.  I wear my hair up almost all the time, so it&#x27;s easy to count when I have it down and I&#x27;m combing or brushing it out.  I have only been counting the last four days.  My 4-day average is 28 hairs a day, so it&#x27;s not abnormally high.  I will check in again if I experience an abnormally high shedding rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Still no high shed rate, but I&#x27;ve grown tired of the smell.  It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, sort of vanilla.  Just not a smell I want all the time.  I was able to increase the time between shampoos, and now I only use shampoo once a month or even longer, and I have been able to increase the number of days between CO-washes to every 3rd day, 4 days with dry shampoo if I don&#x27;t mind looking a bit greasy on the last day.  I have switched my usual CO-wash conditioner to Suave Naturals Tropical Coconut.  It&#x27;s very inexpensive and it works just fine.  I&#x27;m also happier with the smell.  I&#x27;ve tried two other specific CO-wash conditioners so far, Pantene CO-wash and Eden Bodyworks Coconut CO-wash.  Pantene has silicones in it.  It works fine, but it&#x27;s not one that I&#x27;m going to bother with purchasing again.  I like the fact that it has EDTA in it (I swim and have hard water, so I need the EDTA to chelate), but so does my much less expensive Suave.  With the silicones that Pantene contains, it can cause some build-up on hair, though this hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me yet.  Eden is a dreamy product.  I love everything about it except the packaging.  It comes in a tub.  It contains protein, so I only use it when I feel my hair needs protein, about 1-2x a month.</li>
    <li> I bought WEN Cleansing Conditioner, Lavender to try it out and my hair felt wonderful, but after 3 - 4 uses, my scalp started to itch and burn a bit.  This is the second time I have tried WEN and had the same reaction.  Clearly, I must be allergic to one or more of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to find that magical product, I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and found L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Conditioner for $5.99.  I figured it was also a \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot; and it&#x27;s under 6 bucks, what did I have to lose??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is AMAZING.  I have told all my friends and co-workers to go and buy a bottle.  TRY IT!!! It doesn&#x27;t really lather at all, but your hair feels clean and softer than with ANY other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, including Pantene, Dove, Nexxus and many other leave-ins.  This is the real deal.  For $5.99, you can&#x27;t find anything close.  I have fine, curly hair, and normally you can&#x27;t get through it without some heavy conditioning... I am able to run my fingers through my hair in the shower, without combing it for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - I&#x27;m a fan, I&#x27;m hooked.  All I say is.. If you like WEN, try this, for a fraction of the price, you&#x27;ll get the same (or even better) results.</li>
    <li> Love it. this has been what I have been using for months and yes, you must use a lot of it to get the full benefits and leave it on your hair a while, but after trying Wen, then Hair one, then soooo many other off brands. This is the one that works the best for the price and I&#x27;m very happy with it! (If your rich and have more money than you know what to do with get Wen, cause it&#x27;s amazing, but if your a college student / starving artist like me, this is your answer)</li>
    <li> Ive been trying to grow my hair out, but I have had problems with breakage and dry ends. I started using this product based on the good reviews online. I am in love with it! It took about a week or two to see results but my hair is super soft, manageable and the breakage has stopped. Someone mentioned in a review that it smells like victoria&#x27;s secret heavenly and i believe it may be true because my husband mentioned the other day that he liked the way my hair smelled- and that is his favorite perfume. One tip is to make sure you rinse very, very well. If you dont get it all out your hair can end up looking greasy. I rub this in my hair when i first get in the shower then wait 2 minutes. I rinse during the remainder of my shower off and on. I would say about 4 minutes of rinsing all together. Sometimes I also use the dry shampoo spray on my roots right after i shower. I like to go 2-3 days without shampooing to keep my style in place so that cuts back on the greasiness at my roots. I would recommend this product to anyone with long hair that needs some extra TLC. I would not use this is you have short fine hair- it may be a little to much.</li>
    <li> I have never tried WEN but wanted to so I tried this alternative! I love it! It leaves my hair much more soft and manageable. It is much easier to get the tangles out after my shower. I have been using the leave in conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, like vanilla. My only concern is that it seems to go pretty fast, as the bottle isn&#x27;t huge and I use several pumps a day, however, I am not needing to buy shampoo and conditioner, so it&#x27;s a trade off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather, just scrub it in on your roots. TRY THIS CLEANSING CONDITIONER!!!</li>
    <li> I got tipped off to the excellence of L&#x27;Oreal Ever Pure and Ever Strong hair products by a fellow Amazon reviewer a while back and I am eternally grateful. Using sulfate-free shampoo makes a big, long term difference in the condition and manageability of one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme line of gentle, moisturizing products is innovative genius! If you have thick, dry-ish hair, you probably don&#x27;t have to wash your hair as often as those with thin, oily-prone hair. Sometimes you want to \\&quot;freshen\\&quot; your hair and it really isn&#x27;t all that dirty. This is when you use this product: not when it is loaded down with a helmet of hairspray, mousse, and anti-frizz gel but when you take a quick shower and your hair could use a lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product about every other time I wash my hair and I am impressed with the results. It is far gentler than even using L&#x27;Oreal Ever Pure shampoo, but my hair and scalp are clean. Several generous pumps supply enough to create a low lather that is easy to rinse out. The fragrance is very pleasant. No conditioner is necessary, you just lather, wait a minute or so, rinse and go. Afterwards, my hair is easy to style, shiny, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a product for every one. If your hair is thin or oily, this is not going to work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, L&#x27;Oreal will not discontinue this product!</li>
    <li> **UPDATE 3/31/14**&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to come back and state that I&#x27;ve long since stopped using this product. It was too much of a pain to use, and I still wasn&#x27;t able to consistently get a post-wash head of hair without greasy-feeling spots. It very well could be my hair (I&#x27;ve tried other alternative/\\&quot;no shampoo\\&quot; routes with little success), so if you have very thick, dry hair, this might be for you. If you have fine, oily hair, I think this product is just going to drive you crazy. Also, I have pretty manageable hair to begin with, so I&#x27;m just going back to regular shampoo and a strong conditioner for my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Original Post with 4-star review**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now, and I&#x27;m a fan. Am I a rabid fan? No, but I also have pretty manageable, straight, happy hair, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any life-altering changes like others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product because I wanted to use so something less harsh on my hair, and potentially find a better oil/ moisture balance for my poor, greasy scalp. I have very fine, thin, blondish hair, but lots of it. I&#x27;ve always been the kind of person who needs to wash my hair every day or else I look like a greaseball. Without dry shampoo (a lifesaver) I&#x27;d start getting piece-y hair 24 hours post-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first several times I used this product, it felt like I could not rinse it all out for the life of me. I&#x27;d massage it in my scalp, leave it in to do its magic, and rinse, rinse, rinse to no avail. When my hair was dry, there were always patches (usually at the nape of neck or somewhere in the back of my head) that felt disgusting and greasy. I tried using more product as recommended, something like 8-10 pumps, but that didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THen someone on here recommended that you NOT LEAVE the product in your hair in the shower. This has worked magic for me. I use 3-4 pumps to quickly lather as much as I can at the top, sides/back and nape of thehead, and rinse immediately. I then use 4-5 more pumps for another quick, more thorough lather and rinse. I do all of this at the beginning of my shower to let the water run over my hair for extra measure. Make sure to get a lather, as I&#x27;ve found that is key. It&#x27;s a very low lather product, but you do get a little bit while you get a quick arm workout. I personally finish off with a vinegar rinse (one part white vinegar to about three parts water, plus a couple drops of essential oil), which I find helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: none of this may work for you if you live someplace with very hard water. I vacationed in Santa Fe this Christmas, and this stuff never wanted to rinse out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, I don&#x27;t care for it. It&#x27;s very sweetly vanilla-ish. I usually like sweet floral smells (I currently wear Gucci Glamorous Magnolia), and this is just not my favorite. Good thing the scent doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair, which might be due to the vinegar rinse ;)</li>
    <li> It smells nice and works well. I don&#x27;t really see a difference between this product and Wen and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper. I just wish someone would make a all natural product.</li>
    <li> I  HAVE FINE,GRAY,THEN COLORED HAIR.  WITH ALL SHAMPOOS MY HAIR FEELS LIKE STRAW,AND THEN I CANT GET A COMB THRU IT UNLESS I USE TONS OF EXPENSIVE CONDITIONER. WITH THIS EVERCREME, MY HAIR COMES OUT SOFT, SMELLING GOOD AND LOOKING BETTER THAN IT HAS IN AGES. AND IS COMBING FRIENDLY.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Have been using Wen which is very expensive. This is an even better product for alot cheaper! Also love the smell!</li>
    <li> I feel like with cleansing conditioners its a hit or miss depending on your hair type and what works for you. I have very fine hair, and unfortunately this product just did not work for me. It made my hair feel too greasy and not clean, plus personally I&#x27;m not a fan of how it smells. At all.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.  It is similar to Wen which is much more expensive.  I like the product so much I ordered a number of times. It leaves my hair soft, manageable and without sulfates.</li>
    <li> I had read mostly good reviews but a few bad so I was a little hesitant to try it, but i had a $2 off coupon so it was very inexpensive. The smell is really quite nice once my hair is dry. The most amazing part is that my hair was SO SHINY. My split ends are almost completely invisible and this is after only 3 washes. I even let my long (to the middle of my back), slightly wavy hair air dry and it was almost completely smooth. The trick with this is to make sure you use enough. I use about 10-15 pumps for my long hair and one extra for my ends (the pumps are pretty small). The most important part is to make sure you really put some work into the scrubbing part and make sure you RINSE and RINSE again. Overall, I love it and my hair is much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really clean hair as well as you&#x27;d want it to.</li>
    <li> I was watching all those Wen infomercials - but it&#x27;s too expensive, so when L&#x27;Oreal came out with this product (which is similar in ingredients to Wen) I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smell nice, very thick consistency, you do need A LOT of product to clean your scalp thoroughly. - But it works!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is softer,  less dry and frizzy and I need much less product to style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is- since u use so much product (I have medium coarse hair that goes down to my shoulders), it ends up more expensive compared to regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also annoying, since the stuff is dense, the pump wont pump the last 1/4 of the bottle and u have to flip it over and squeeze. I wish L&#x27;Oreal would use the tube package like the other products from this line.</li>
    <li> Smells funny, has a drying effect due to the glycerin proior to the weather. It had trouble cleansing heavy product from my hair. Perhaps if you use oils or water soluable cone serums...this will do a better job at helping you. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Oh, for heaven&#x27;s sake, this has the most suffocatingly sweet and penetrating odor. It even defeated a vinegar rinse; I can only hope it will wear off eventually before I&#x27;m permanently nauseous. Does nobody make a scentless cleansing conditioner???</li>
    <li> The smell is overpowering.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells just like warm vanilla by bath and body. It works fairly well for cleaning hair, but not if my hair is very dirty or if I do a mask on my dry hair. I found that I do have to use a lot of this stuff, so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last that long, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay in my opinion for getting something without sulfates or harmful stuff.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner does really help to make your hair look great. The big problem i found with it was that I have long hair and even though my hair is fine I have a lot of it. My biggest problem is the price. because this soap does not lather which is a good thing don&#x27;t get me wrong the amount I had to use on my hair caused the bottle to last a little over 2 weeks. If I used any less than the nearly 20 pumps then I would have sections of my hair that were obviously missed because it would feel dirty and oily in that area. I won&#x27;t be buying this again after I figured up pricing the amount you get in here sure is a good way to try out cleansing conditioner cause it wont hurt your pockets but I spent the extra on the wen hair products now. if you add up how much it cost to equal their 30 day supply and add to it you get extra supplies it is a much better bargain.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen cleansing conditioner and really love how manageable it makes my long, fine hair.  I was looking for a more affordable alternative and found this product.  I did read a lot of the reviews before buying, and most were good, so decided to give it a try.  Many reviewers complain about the scent of this cleanser, and others say it smells like vanilla.  I happen to love anything that smells like vanilla,and this does smell like vanilla, but to me, it is a very pronounced PLASTIC vanilla smell.  That is the only way I can describe it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad enough for me to not use it, but it does smell plastic like, but it&#x27;s not that bad!  In comparison to Wen cleanser, I have found that this product is at least just as good.  Certainly when you consider that a bottle of this cost under 6 dollars and Wen is 39!  I did go ahead  and use the same directions that applies to Wen:  for long hair a prewash with about 10 pumps of product, then a second wash with at least 10 pumps and then leave the second application on your hair while finishing your shower.  Then rinse very, very good.  It makes my hair nice and manageable, full of body, and moisturized.  For me, this type of cleansing is a once or twice a week hair treat.  Just like with the Wen products, if I use them too much, they start to weigh my hair down.  Overall, I am happy with this product, and will be using this much cheaper alternative to Wen.  I would add that they do need to come up with a better pump!  It&#x27;s a little frustrating to use because not much comes out when you press on it, and you do need to apply quite a bit more of these products than you would shampoo.  Also, they say it&#x27;s low lathering, I would call it no lathering, but that&#x27;s okay, you&#x27;ll be surprised, it really does get your hair clean without harsh suds.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too good, my roots are too much oil</li>
    <li> If you have dry, damage or color treated hair this is for you.  I noticed after I got my hair highlighted that my hair was brittle and seemed a lot thinner.  You do need to use a lot of this especially if you have long hair but it really moisturizes your hair and prevents it from breaking.  The only thing I found strange about it is that  It does not sud like the regular stripping shampoos.  I also noticed it works better for me if I dilute it a bit with water first since it can be rather thick.  The results are fantastic, not only does my hair seem softer and healthier, I am not loosing as much down the drain when I wash my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;It is similar Wen shampoo but a lot less expensive.  I used to be able to buy it at places like Target but it seems they discontinued it.  So I am so thankful Amazon still sells it.  I hate to think what my hair would look like without it especially since I will continue to do highlights.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all.  I can tolerate the L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl Hydracharge Cleansing Conditioner even though I don&#x27;t like the smell of either one.  This product left my hair with a greasy film in it.  I purchased both products based on some reviews I read that they were comparable to Wen without the high price.  For me, I will spend the extra money on Wen.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple of months.  I was really excited about it, since I wanted to try the Wen line but am allergic to aloe (which this product does not contain).  It didn&#x27;t damage my hair.  It made my showers quicker.  And it smelled like Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s Heavenly perfume.  But after a while, I noticed that my hair, which had never been glossy by any means, looked much duller than usual.  I switched back to a shampoo/conditioner combo and my hair bounced right back.  I&#x27;m going to assume that it wasn&#x27;t enough of a cleanser for my hair...and that it was leaving build up behind.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair is naturally curly.  Normally I have to put a ton of products in to reduce the frizz.  I have noticed a dramatic reduction in frizz when I let my hair dry without product.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE the fragrance.  It&#x27;s kind of a spicy vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t stop making this L&#x27;Oreal!  I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
    <li> I have fine blonde hair and not very much of it, come to think of it.  Shampoos are often too harsh - leaving it stripped and squeaky - and gloopy conditioners weigh it down leaving it flat.  The Evercreme is wonderful.  One pump cleanses my hair gently and quickly; since there is no endless sudsing and second conditioning step, I am through in half the time even if I rinse for 2 solid minutes, which I always do.  My hair is soft and manageable with the matte shine that&#x27;s the hallmark if clean hair.  I have been using Evercreme for . . . it must be 3 years now and I wouldn&#x27;t change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product! It reminds me of Wen at a much lower price. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Wen cleansing conditioners for a few years and decided to try this.  I really love the way it makes my very dry hair feel.  The smell is light, but very nice.  I have been choosing this over the wen since I first tried this.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a cheaper alternative to WEN. I did not think it is as good and it doesn&#x27;t smell as good either. The bottle is small so end of spending almost the same for 2 bottles of this vs. 1 bottle of WEN. I get WEN on auto-delivery so it ends up costing in about $17 per bottle.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and fine and was quite dry before I started using this product. I had originally started using Wen but switched to this to save money. This is just as good and the results are the same. I&#x27;ve been using this since November and really notice the difference. My hair is not as dry, the color is more rich, and I do not color my hair. I do have some gray mixed in but it&#x27;s much less noticeable with having more conditioned hair. My husband has even noticed a difference a comments on how much healthier my hair looks.</li>
    <li> I have type 3B hair with patches of 3A hair and this product was no friend of mine. The texture is strange and it didn&#x27;t clean. Not enough slip and mediocre de-tangling power.</li>
    <li> I wanted something to replace WEN that didn&#x27;t cost so dang much.  This was okay.  However, it wasn&#x27;t as good for my hair as WEN is and I won&#x27;t buy anymore.  Again, it&#x27;s not a bad product, it just didn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to try this after reading horrible reviews of WEN.  I am not too sure about this. I have long, medium thickness hair.  I have to use a hot air curler on it when Im done drying it otherwise it just looks limp.  Anyway, So I used about 20 pumps just to get a decent amount of the cleanser out. I applied to my wet hair and got a small lather as directed on bottle.  Used a clip like I always do and put my hair up while I finished my shower.  After rinsing and towel drying, it was kinda torturous getting my wide tooth comb through my hair and I also noticed more hair coming out while combing through it.  Dried my hair, it didn&#x27;t look any different than when I use the evercreme poo and conditioner. So I styled my hair with my normal hot air curler, I have to curl my hair otherwise it just looks blah.  It seemed very shiny and smooth at first but as the day is wearing on, my hair feels dry:(  I&#x27;m still going to continue using this, just so far not that impressed....</li>
    <li> Great for my hair. Love the shampoo and leave in moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I only use sulfate free products in my hair. I really like this Loreal line....all then. I keep buying and seen more and more good results. I recommend.</li>
    <li> So wanted it to work but simply horrible for me.  I have long thick wavy hair and it made it brittle and sticky.  The smell isn&#x27;t my cup of tea either, but that&#x27;s just me.  Could not seem to get it rinsed out thoroughly no matter how hard I tried.  Throwing out after just one use.</li>
    <li> What can I say, but wow! I got this for my fine, colored (red) hair. Red fades so quickly, and I needed something gentle. This certainly fits the bill! It does smell strongly like warm vanilla, and the consistency is indeed like an extra thick conditioner. I left a silver dollar dollop of this in my hair for about 20 minutes (because I had the extra time). This left my hair feeling soft, and get this, tangles were easy to brush through. No typical hair breaking off, and no struggling. The brush glided through, the color still looks fresh, and my hair still smells of warm vanilla. I really kinda bought it thinking that it was a gimmick. This is the first product that really seems to live up to its claims in a very long time. The only cons are the price for the amount that you get. Also the stupid pump, because my pump doesn&#x27;t even work. I have to resort to taking the top off and squeezing some out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Quick delivery - strong vanilla smell but it fades.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I wanted to try Wen but I can&#x27;t justify the price. The smell of this product is very strong out of the bottle it&#x27;s very heavily scented. I will leave your hair very soft. I have thin hair so I don&#x27;t use this every time as it can leave your hair rather flat. But if you are looking for a cleansing conditioner this is a good one to try, just be warned it is very heavily scented.</li>
    <li> Smells bad, works good.  Its not Wen- but i am using it as my prewash ( then using my favorite Wen) since i have short spikey hair with lots of product in it daily.  So i have to say, this really smells bad.  I would never use it alone.  But as my Prewash-  i dont care what it smells like.  By using it- i save half my Wen and it conditions fine.  I just ordered a second bottle.  The pump could use some work. I have to pump at least 10 times to get the little amount needed.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have thin dry hair and it is the best product I have found for it. It is an easy one step product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair overly dry like most other things. You do need to use quite a bit more than regular shampoo, so if you try it, be sure you use enough to really get to the roots and clean your head!</li>
    <li> My medium length, wavy and thick hair did not like this at all. Weighed it down and felt greasy, I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out. The smell is incredibly strong and gave me a headache. I think this is better suited for fine hair and for someone who does not have any sensitivity to smell</li>
    <li> Seems to do a nice job, but as others have said, way too strong perfume smell.  Cloyingly ghastly vanilla type.  Used it one time and that was it.</li>
    <li> I love the other sulfate-free Loreal products.  I was excited to try this product as I have naturally curly, color treated hair.  I work out 6 days a week and get very sweaty so not washing my hair is not an option.  I bought this product in hopes of keeping my hair from looking dry and frizzy.  Unfortunately, this product did not work for me at all.  It did not make my hair soft and shiny, nor was it more manageable. It made my hair just look tired and feel weighed down.  I tried it for a week figuring I needed to give it a chance to \\&quot;balance out\\&quot; and boy was I wrong.  The more I used it, the worse my hair looked and felt.  This product really made my hair look greasy at the roots.  My hair was so weighed down on my scalp that it actually made me look very thin on top near my part.  When I finally gave up and returned to my regular shampoo it felt like a relief.  My hair sprang back to life.  No more ugly bald look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I would rather have my hair look a little dry than look oily, weighed down and gross.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a month and am addicted!&lt;br /&gt;#1. love that it is VEGAN and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;#2. my hair feels fuller and has less split ends&lt;br /&gt;#3. the color didn&#x27;t fade like other people said, news flash - your color fades no matter what product you use. I have very deep red highlights/low lights and they are just as deep today as they were a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;#4. I hate stripping my hair with harsh shampoos and this does not do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to many people and will continue using it. PLUS HELLO.... the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Wow! I have to say that this is the single best new product that I have tried in years!  I always had what is termed \\&quot;nice\\&quot; hair (shiny, thick enough, healthy looking) until I hit about the mid-forty range.  My hair started to look old.  It became very dry and dull and I could not find \\&quot;the fix\\&quot; for it.  I truly was just coming to terms with the fact that my hair was bowing to the will of crazy hormones and that I had better just get used to it!  One day I saw a commercial for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s new Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I really didn&#x27;t expect a great deal of difference, but knew it probably couldn&#x27;t look a lot worse than it already did. The first time I used the cleansing conditioner, I washed my hair twice through - the first wash I used about 12 pumps of the product (after getting my hair soaking wet) and distributed as evenly as possible on my scalp and through to the ends - using an extra splash of water helps with the distribution.  I knew in advance not to expect a great deal of foam like a regular shampoo, so that wasn&#x27;t a surprise. The second wash, I used slightly less (about 10 pumps) and plenty of water and this time, I had more foaming action.  I left the product on my hair for about two minutes and then I combed it through with a wide-tooth comb and rinsed really well.  I could NOT believe how much better my hair looked when it dried!  My hair had almost all of the luster and shine that it used to when I was young.  I am serious!  This is a wonderful product and I am more than thrilled with it.  I am on my second bottle and it works every bit as well now as it did the first time.  Try it and I think you will be surprised at how well it works!</li>
    <li> I used Wen for a week and a half, loved the results, but ran out, so it was going to cost me an arm and a leg to keep that up.  I read the reviews on this and decided to try it.  It didn&#x27;t work as well as Wen and it smells HORRIBLE.  I felt like my hair was on fire all day.  They have a similar one for \\&quot;curly hair\\&quot; which I tried because it talked about helping with frizz.  It is still very strong smelling, but MUCH better than this and my hair is more in control even though I am drying it straight.  I can&#x27;t believe people think this smells good!</li>
    <li> I washed my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and it worked quite well, but I still had to use conditioner after.I like the product and will be using it in the future.</li>
    <li> The product results are equal to Wen, but the scent is TOO strong and unappealing!  I feel the condition of my hair is comparable to the more expensive Wen, however the odor makes me unwilling to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews that said it was JUST as good as WEN cleansing conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using WEN for 3 weeks, so today I decided to give this a try.  I must say, it&#x27;s not bad.  I feel like WEN is superior in a head to head match up, but for the price and availability, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It leaves your hair silky and softer than the average shampoo and conditioner, it smells nice (yes it does), and it&#x27;s cheap in comparison to WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It&#x27;s not a good detangler, and the pump is ridiculously small for the amount you have to use.  You mine as well take the top of and squeeze the bottle. The bottle is way too small, you won&#x27;t get many uses out of it, if you have longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  If you can&#x27;t afford WEN, this is a nice product.  It&#x27;s sulfate, paraben, and harmful salt free, and it&#x27;s vegan.  Some say the smell is too loud and too musky.  I DO NOT like musky smells, but this has a nice vanilla smell after it&#x27;s been rinsed and dried... it&#x27;s not bad at all, unless you hate vanilla, or are super sensitive to perfume.  ALL in all, I would and will recommend this product to friends.  Just don&#x27;t expect a miracle, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Has an unpleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t lather up.  Can&#x27;t wait till I use it up.</li>
    <li> This causes less build up than WEN and is cheaper too.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this con-cleanser because of the cost, but it weighed down my fine, long hair and made it look greasy and flat. Other conditioning cleansers I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t do that - although those same cleansers are much more expensive.  Even if this stuff DID work on my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because of the scent.  It smells VERY funky - like burnt sugar and milk.  Last night my husband mentioned my hair smelled &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; after my shower, so this cleanser is going down the drain and the bottle is going to the recycling bin.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try WEN, but could never bring myself to spend the money on it. I was super excited when I found this. I have thin, curly/wavy hair and it gets oily after one day, so I was a bit worried that my hair would be greasy, but it&#x27;s not! It feels and looks clean like I&#x27;d used regular shampoo. My curls are much less frizzy and more defined then they were before. I am also trying to grow my hair out and I hope that this helps with keeping it healthy. I hope that this product doesn&#x27;t go away now that I&#x27;ve found it!!!</li>
    <li> All I can say is that my wife absolutely loves this product for her hair and is planing to purchase more of it</li>
    <li> There are a lot of reviews already, but I am going to add my two cents on my experience with this product. I have very fine, colored, brittle hair. Usually I have to wash every other day, since it gets oily very quickly. I tried Wen and loved it, but cannot afford it. So, I tried Hair One Hair Cleanser and Conditioner with Jojoba Hair Conditioners And Treatments and L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner. Hair One wins hands down. L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme smells better, in my opinion, but that&#x27;s about it. My hair feels greasy the very next day. For me, Hair One it is.</li>
    <li> At first, I became obsessed with this product. It smelled great, and it I thought it was a great alternative to Wen or other cleansing conditioners that I had to buy online, such as Hair One, since I don&#x27;t live anywhere near a Sally&#x27;s. I bought another bottle to bring with me while studying abroad, ready to have great smelling hair without sulfates, especially because I&#x27;ve been getting the Keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;  The first day I settled into my place abroad, I took a shower, ready to get the awful feel of traveling out of my hair and as I was blow drying my hair after I noticed how greasy my hair was! It looked as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks! My friends all noticed it too. I decided to give it another shot, using less and keeping it far away from my scalp (but how was I supposed to wash my roots since this is supposed to substitute for shampoo?) The next time, it was the same situation. Greasy, greasy, greasy. I was so angry that I had bought two bottles and expected great results, like the first few days and had to buy shampoo with sulfates from the convenience store.&lt;br /&gt;  The next day, I used the regular shampoo and used this as a conditioner only. My hair still felt a little greasy but wow did the normal shampoo really clean! I&#x27;ve taken this product back home and now sometimes use it as a deep conditioner, after I use a STRONG shampoo, so I know that it wont add any grease.&lt;br /&gt;  All in all, I am very disappointed in this and am surprised no one else has commented on how greasy this makes your hair feel, and look.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago in the hopes that I would love it and that my curiosity about trying Wen would be sated.  What a waste of money.  No matter how much I used, my hair was still dry and didn&#x27;t feel clean.  I felt compelled to write a review of this product after shelling out the dough to buy Wen.  It&#x27;s night and day.  The Wen actually worked - and did a good job.  This loreal stuff did not - and you could even tell the difference in how the product felt before using it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this if you are curious about Wen.  Just buy the real thing because this stuff doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence about this one. For reference, I have lots of waist long, thick hair that frizzes up pretty easily in humidity. I use flat irons and curling irons regularly (2 to 3 times weekly) and color every 3 months with ammonia-free hair color. Overall, my hair is in pretty good shape but I was so drawn in by the \\&quot;conditioning rinse\\&quot; fad that I had to try this. Wen is way overpriced and I decided pretty much right away not to even bother with it. Anyway, I started with 3 day unwashed hair (greasy roots, dry-ish ends) and wet my hair thoroughly. I applied 5 pumps initially, worked it into a light lather, nothing real frothy but I expected this. FIVE pumps pretty much vanished in a few seconds of rubbing so I applied an additional 10 pumps. Once again, I worked it into a light lather, re-wet my hair to boost the lather and left it alone for the rest of my shower. I rinsed it off real well finally and let it air dry on its own. Nothing real special at first but my hair smelled really good and felt smooth, so I went to bed. The next day, my hair was beautiful and soft with loads of shine, almost no frizz and completely manageable. I was amazed! I immediately curled my hair and enjoyed lush waves for another 3 days. My hair held the curl amazingly well the whole time, I usually need to spray it with a light hairspray to achieve this but not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair wash #2 went kind of the same except my roots were way greasier. I worked in the conditioning wash like I did the first time, 15 pumps, same amount of time. Rinsed it out, let it air dry again. The next day, my roots were STILL greasy and limp. I was so disappointed as I did everything exactly the same as the first time I used it. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve resumed my normal shampooing routine with my usual products. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not using enough product, seeing how my hair is really long and thick, but I gave up on it. Now I use it on my 2 yr. old baby who has fine baby hair and it works really well for her. I can see this product working for some, namely those with finer, shorter hair- but it&#x27;s a no go for me. Lovely smell anyway :)t works really well for her. I can see this product working for some, namely those with finer, shorter hair- but it&#x27;s a no go for me. Lovely smell anyway :)</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I have normal thin straight hair. My hair was left limp, greasy, and dull. I could feel the oil in my hair after blow drying. It also tangled way more, and I lost a LOT of hair during my washing and drying it. I didn&#x27;t care for the scent, either, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a hair product, more like a perfume. I had been using [[ASIN:B004WPHFE8 Lisa Rachel Conditioner &amp; Cleanser for Color Treated Hair 12 oz.]] but was running low and wanted to give this a shot. No directions on the bottle, figured it was the same as the LR stuff. I used it for three weeks, until my back up supply of LR came in. In the meantime I had cut my bra length hair to a super short A-line bob, and it still didn&#x27;t work for me. there was no bounce, at all, to my hair, it just laid limp on my scalp. I would not recommend, if you&#x27;re looking for a cleansing conditioner and WEN is too crazy expensive, try Lisa Rachel&#x27;s stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try wen, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay for it. AND I can&#x27;t stand it when they make you buy it through the mail. Proactive makes you do that same thing and I won&#x27;t try that either. Soooo, I was very excited to find this on the target shelf and tried it the same night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse, colored, thick wavy hair. It Doesn&#x27;t get much more challenging than that! This product makes my hair feel amazing! I love that it&#x27;s an all in one. Bye bye extra conditioning creams, shining serums, curl tamers etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft youthful hair  AND easy on the pocketbook. What&#x27;s not to like...</li>
    <li> I usually use Wen, but it&#x27;s getting too expensive for me so I wanted to try an alternative cleansing conditioner. I bought this yesterday and used it today.  I used it just as I would Wen. My hair turned out so beautiful, shiny, bouncy and full of body. Plus, it smells wonderful. The scent reminds me of Revlon&#x27;s Flex Balsam shampoo from a long time ago.  This product is Da Bomb for my hair! I am in love with it and will buy it by the case, if I can. You must remember to use quite a bit. Mix a little water in your hair and massage your scalp really well to remove the oil. Then work it all through your hair like you would a shampoo. Then rinse fairly well. Repeat the lathering process, even though this doesn&#x27;t lather like shampoo. Clip your hair up and leave in for the remainder of your shower. Then rinse really, really well. It takes longer to rinse out than shampoo, but if you don&#x27;t rinse, rinse, rinse, your hair will feel greasy. Trust me!  Put a pea sized amount through your hair before you get out of the shower as a leave in conditioner. Your hair will be so easy to comb through!  Give this product a chance. If you use enough of it and really rinse well, you will love it too!</li>
    <li> It seems the stores do not regularly stock this.  I hope this is not already being discontinued.  It smells good.  It rinses clean. Hair is easy to detangle after use.  Hair is clean and silky and shiny after use.  No other conditioner works this well.  Some that claim to condition require you to use a LOT of the product to get the detangling and conditioning effect.  Yes, Wen rinses clean, but you have to use a whole bottle.  Others condition deeply, but don&#x27;t rinse as clean.  Some may leave hair silky, but with residue.  With a lot of residue, hair is temporarily shiny, but then quickly looks greasy.  This product does not do that.  There are a lot of shampoos with a little conditioner added in.  This is almost like conditioner with a bit of shampoo built in.  If discontinued, it will be hard to replace.</li>
    <li> I just now found this product after seeing it advertised. I didn&#x27;t find any of the other L&#x27;oreal hair products to be anything out of the ordinary, but the conditioning cleanser is Wen&#x27;s match. I prefer it. The results are more predictable/consistant with hair being clean, shiny, and bouncy. No weighing my thin, fine hair down. My hair feels more healthy than with Wen.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Just as good as Wen and way more affordable.  It really helps keep my hair healthy, even thought I&#x27;m in the process of growing it longer, frequently color it, and didn&#x27;t get it trimmed for 9 months!  Even after all this, I hardly have any split ends.  I also love the scent, it&#x27;s a rich creamy vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;The Only complaint I have is that the bottle is rather small and you have to use quite a lot of this on your hair, so the small bottles run out quickly. Also, its hard to tell when you are running low, so I always have to keep a couple extra bottles around!  I would love to see this in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> For as inexpensive as this product is I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I tried using my regular shampoo once about 2 weeks after starting (Wella) and my hair felt staticky and dry. For winter this is a great product!  I do still use a moisturizing conditioner on my ends.</li>
    <li> I have very fine greasy hair and this product was just too heavy for me. It made my hair feel and look healthier but it weighed my hair down so much I have to use dry shampoo right after just to make it not look completely flat. The smell when you are applying it is awful too. It smells like chemicals with a hint of vanilla. I don&#x27;t hate it enough to throw it away but I will not be repurchasing after finishing this bottle.</li>
    <li> I have horribly damaged hair and go through &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; of hair products the way most people sample chocolate, wine, or other food products.  I own hundreds of different products, all purchased with the intent to repair the damage my hair has sustained.  While I am usually a Redken, Biolage, Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil, and Wen fan, and rarely purchase &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; hair products, I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme Cleansing Conditioner a try.  It&#x27;s *significantly* cheaper than Wen, so I figured it was worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~ Effectiveness as a cleanser ~~~ To be honest, I don&#x27;t know that this product actually did anything to *clean* my hair, especially near my scalp.  I didn&#x27;t notice that this product was any more effective than &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; with conditioner alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~ Stripping of natural (and added) oils ~~~  This product doesn&#x27;t seem to strip oils from the hair, which is (in some ways), a good thing because it healthier for the hair.  *However*, it might make some uncomfortable that the oils near the scalp remain on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~ Rinsing and residue ~~~  This is the area in which I feel this product might fail.  It is a cream that seems to truly &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to the hair, which means it is difficult to rinse out.  I have tried this product in both the shower and the bath, and while rinsing in the shower was certainly more effective than in the bath, I have struggled to rinse this out.  I DON&#x27;T have that issue with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~ Smell ~~~  While this product has a decent scent that is slightly floral and slightly sweet, it is a little too floral for my taste.  I prefer the sweeter smell of some of my other products (Wen, Redken All Soft, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~ Value ~~~  This product is SIGNIFICANTLY less expensive, ounce-for-ounce, than Wen Cleansing Conditioner, but I found I actuallly have to use a bit more then I do with Wen.  However, it is still a pretty good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~ Overall Impressions ~~~  Ifthis product were easier to rinse out, and did as good a job at softening hair as Wen, I&#x27;d certainly give it a much higher rating.  These two &amp;#34;strikes,&amp;#34; though, are big ones, which is the reason for my three-star rating.</li>
    <li> This is by far an amazing shampoo absolutely the best cleansing conditioner on the market! Wen is no comparison!</li>
    <li> I must preface this review by saying that I am an Afro-Caribbean woman, living in an extremely hot and dry environment. This does not bode well for my hair, which is extremely coarse and dry. I am on a constant quest for hair products that moisturise and soften my natural hair, without having to resort to chemical processing which has caused extreme damage to my hair in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that cleansing conditioners were becoming more mainstream, I was ecstatic, and guinea pigged myself with a number of them, all with mixed results. However, the one constant was the fact that no matter how soft the products made my hair feel during the washing process, once my hair dried, it would return to its dry, \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, tangled state. Where was the softness and manageability that was promised??? Even Wen, which was supposed to be the best cleansing conditioner available failed abominably at keeping its promise to make my hair less dry. And the price was not very competitive, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw Evercreme for six bucks and decided I had nothing to lose. I also bought the deep conditioner, since, for my hair type a cleansing conditioner would never be enough. All I can say is that I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t want to throw a parade and laud it after only one use, but the difference in my hair is amazing. It was super soft and untangled even after it dried. Unlike Wen, which did not help much as I tried to comb my hair out during and after washing, Evercreme just allowed my comb to slip through my extremely thick hair and perpetually knotted hair like it was silk. Will keep a watch to see if the performance improves over time.</li>
    <li> ,I had great expectations for this product mainly because the cost of Wen is so prohibitive! Sadly, my expectations weren&#x27;t even close to met. This product doesn&#x27;t have Menthol in it as all adult formulations do in the Wen line, which was another plus for me as my skin is way too sensitive to Menthol. My experience with the Evercreme left me wanting more, much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair turned out dry with major fly away issues. I used the product correctly. This formula burned my eyes as well. There is a chemical smell that is not masked by the fragrance. With the Wen product my hair was fabulous! I have to use the children&#x27;s formula to avoid the Menthol. Wen also has pro vitamin b 5. This does not. I guess I&#x27;m stuck paying ridiculous prices for Wen. But at least it works.</li>
    <li> It smooths hair with great power! I just don&#x27;t need to worry any more about my hair. I miss it a lot when I leave it.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, medium thickness curly hair, so I think this product was made with my hair type in mind. Odor aside, the product left my hair limp and not very soft. Granted, my hair was clean, but I didn&#x27;t like the end result after I styled it. It felt like I had washed it with Pert Plus or another 2-in-1 product. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The scent is very strong and has a heavy perfume to it. The pump was also difficult to use and dispensed a very small amount at a time.</li>
    <li> This is just okay. It&#x27;s not the most moisturizing or conditioning, it also foams up a lot more than any other cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve tried. The bottle is also REALLY small for the amount I need to use. I have really long and really thick hair, and I went through it in no time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wen girl for a couple of years.  After a financial hardship I decided to look for an alternative.  A drug store purchase was not a good substitute but this product is a great substitute.  It&#x27;s not quite as good as Wen but for less than 25% of the price? I&#x27;m now a L&#x27;Oréal girl!  Sorry,  Chaz!</li>
    <li> I have tried several kinds of cleansing conditioners, and this is by far the best one!  It smells wonderful and is reasonably priced.  It is not tested on animals (unlike some of the other products L&#x27;Oreal makes) and has no animal byproducts.  It honestly doesn&#x27;t get any better than this!  By the way, I have long, naturally curly hair with a medium thickness.  After using my sulfate and paraben free Evercurl Hydracharge shampoo (which I also highly recommend... it smells great and has hibiscus and grape seed extracts), I use this conditioner.  It literally makes the tangles in my hair melt!  As a result, I have much less hair breakage than I did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope L&#x27;Oreal never stops making this product.  If they do, I don&#x27;t know what I will do!</li>
    <li> I was reading some reviews on a $40 Wen cleansing conditioner product when a reviewer said she got the same results using L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme Cleansing Conditioner for a fraction of the price.  I went to Target looking for it and found it there for $5.99 a bottle.  I follow the Wen directions when I use it, and from the first treatment, my hair was soft, curly and more manageable.  I use 8-10 pumps per section and comb it through my hair with my fingertips and a wide-tooth comb. It doesn&#x27;t lather up like shampoo does, but my hair starts feeling silky and detangled while I&#x27;m using it.  I rinse and pat my hair dry with an old t-shirt (towels dry out hair) and apply EcoStyler section by section to set it.  My hair ends up shiny, curly and manageable - and it dries the same way it looks when it&#x27;s wet (folks with afro-curly hair know what I mean by that).  The combination of those two products for a fraction of the cost of what I would pay for Wen or other products has created miraculous results with my hair.  I used to spend sometimes $30 for a bottle of afro-curly hair product, now I have a huge tub of EcoStyler that will last a lifetime, and the L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme for less than $6 a bottle. My hair looks and feels better than it did with all those other expensive products I used to use.  It&#x27;s been over six years since I let the relaxer grow out of my hair and started wearing it natural, and it&#x27;s only been in the last two months that I&#x27;ve finally found products to use on it that give the desired results at an exceptionally reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This sounded interesting so I bought it and gave it a try.  It left my hair feeling like it had a film on it, and yes, I did rinse enough.  I even wrote the company to complain and they offered me my money back, but I was unable to find the receipt and couldn&#x27;t remember what I had paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then forgot about it and it was sitting at the back of a shelf when I realized I was out of shampoo a couple of days ago and gave it another try. Same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is going in the trash so I won&#x27;t forget again some time in the future and use it.</li>
    <li> I was always super skeptical of these types of products, but intrigued. I watched the WEN infomercials and thought it was too good to be true. But on a whim I purchased the Loreal product because I wanted to know what all the excitment was about without paying 40 bucks for WEN. It&#x27;s amazing, honestly It takes some getting use to but it makes my hair fabulous. I was nervous cause my hair has been dyed/bleached and then dyed/bleached some more, so i usually rely on a moisturizing shampoo and deep conditioner, some gloss serum, and some anti frizz lotion. One product seemed too good to be true. This stuff does exactly what it says it does, my hair is shiny, bouncy, clean, and sooo sofft. Its like a new head of hair. Ive already told all my friends about it, lol. I just ordered wen cause im almost out of this just to see if its any better (idk how it could be better my hair is already amazing) but ill give it a try. Seriously I recommend this stuff, its GREAT!</li>
    <li> A couple years ago, I saw Wen advertised on QVC and got so excited about it. That was the first I heard that shampoo, something I&#x27;ve used almost daily for my entire life, is bad for my hair and my health. Long story short, I tried Wen and, aside from the high price tag, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Why didn&#x27;t my hair look like the hair the girls had on QVC? Why does it feel weighed-down when it&#x27;s supposed to be light and soft? Let me say that if I use enough, of Wen or this product, my hair is NOT greasy. That day. But I am a daily hair-washer for this reason: my hair is oily and feels gross if I don&#x27;t wash it daily. So, in short, cleansing conditioners do not work for me. If you have dry hair and can go a few days without washing it, maybe this is something you should try. Also, I would like to agree with some of the other reviewers: the fragrance is VERY strong and stays in your hair all day! It smells exactly like the cheap Warm Vanilla Sugar scent from Bath and Body Works, and, if you use enough of this stuff, it smells as if you soaked your hair in it for three hours. It doesn&#x27;t go away. If you love that smell and constantly want to smell it, then, again, maybe this product will work for you. However, it gave me a headache and was kind of nauseating. But, everyone is different. This is cheap, so if you want to try it, try it!</li>
    <li> Not amazed. But it was cheap so I cant complain too much. Would buy again in a pinch but not really for regular use. Left my hair a little greasy but smelling nice.</li>
    <li> Comparable to Wen? I&#x27;ve never tried Wen....it&#x27;s too rich for my blood! However, I am an African American woman with very dry and thick 4B/C type hair. I&#x27;ve realized that its difficult to find products that are not drying on my hair and smell good. I was so excited to discover this product. This product leave my hair so soft and smelling so good. if your hair is super dry I would advise that you give this product a try. Keep in mind that this product does have alcohol in it however it is not the drying alcohol. I read that any alcohol that starts with the letter C or the letter S is moisturizing alcohol. So don&#x27;t be afraid of it. Do your research, read the labels and educate yourself on the good and bad ingredients so you will be better informed.</li>
    <li> The moisturizing is great but the smell is a little off-putting.</li>
    <li> Use as directed and your hair will be soooo soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> NO NO NO. WEN IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO.  GOT IT TRIED IT, THE PERFUME IS SO STRONG THAT I ACTUALLY HAD TO WAS IT OUT ASAP.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as great as other L&#x27;oreal products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I was disappointed. I was so excited to find a sulfate and silicone-free shampoo! However, my hair is now worse for the wear AFTER having used this product for two months. As a curly girl with fine hair, I think the problem is, paradoxically, that this cleansing conditioner does NOT condition hair very well and/or dries your hair out over time. I might try using this product again in conjunction with a conditioner and see if that helps.</li>
    <li> I have nerver written a review for a product before, but this one definitely deserves one. I will never use anything else on my hair. This product is amazing! I have tried Wen and I really liked it, but it is too expensive for me because my hair is very long. For all of you who have to braid their hair every night so they don&#x27;t wake up with a nasty mess of tangled tresses, try this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be a complete slam dunk 5/5 for me except the pump is quite ridiculous. There is no way to get enough product out by pumping! I would take way to long. I have to unscrew the top to get at the product. Fix the pump and....violas! Perfection!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst thing I have ever used on my hair. I regularly use normal conditioner on my hair, shampoo about once a month, so I wanted to try this since it&#x27;s supposedly formulated for conditioner-only washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could barely get a comb through while my hair was drying afterwards. Could barely get a brush through once it was completely dry. My hair felt heavy and coated in something I can only describe as waxy buildup, and that&#x27;s only after one use of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell nearly made me sick. I don&#x27;t have too many problems with scents, but this stuff was overpowering and gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to get this at my local store, but recently i cant find it anywhere but online now, so i order it in bulk now. I have long hair and this stuff is amazing. I ran out a few weeks ago and had to use a normal shampoo again and i realized how much i love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I tried this wondering if I would really like it. I love it! I use it as my main hair care tool while traveling, it is lightweight, silky, and effective. While at home I alternate between my normal shampoo, conditioner or deep treatment and this one step. It helps to keep my hair less stressed by the numerous regular steps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for the last 20+ years. Unfortunately, my hair grays come back fast and I find that I have to color twice as often as everyone else...now I&#x27;m coloring every 3 weeks to cover the new gray. I have very thick, course, frizzy/curly hair and this has helped immensely...even the hairstylist I saw the other day raved about how my hair felt. I used the WEN for two bottles but the expense was ridiculous so I switched to Loreal Cleansing Conditioner, which is available at Wal-Mart for $6. I use it just like the WEN (same as you would shampoo) and let it sit for several minutes before rinsing....AMAZING!!! I still get frizz in the humidity but my hair is soft, I have less breakage, and my color lasts longer!! I will not go back to shampoo again and use the whole line form Loreal for all my styling products now! I also love the one for curly hair!!!  Amazing product!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping so much I would like this as others of its kind are pretty pricey but it left my hair feeling dirty. I used it for a couple weeks off and on but just could not like it. I read up beforehand and found out how much yo use which is quite a lot but then tried it with less also to see if it made a difference but it did not.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, my hair feels softer. I have really thick hair and no matter how much I wash it, it gets knotted up come the time to buzz my head. now the clippers run through my hair flawlessly after using this for a bit.</li>
    <li> I have been a Wen user for a very long time,and saw this Conditioning Cleanser at my local Rite-Aid....of course I had to try it, the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and actually think it feels and looks better than the Wen I was using.  I have very fine, color treated, spiral permed hair and shampoo just dries my hair out.  In fact a couple of times a week I used to put a thick conditioner on at night (on damp hair) to help give me some moisture, well I don&#x27;t feel like I need to do that anymore.  With the Wen it was better than the old shampoo and conditioner regime but I still felt like something was missing....with the Loreal product whatever was missing is not anymore.  My hair is not dry, nor does it feel weighed down (as it did with Wen) I have found the perfect balance with Loreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I would have is that while the scent of the product smells great, but for me it is very strong almost to the point of perfume.  I have a very strong sense of smell and for myself the smell is a bit overbearing.  I am hoping to get used to that as I really do love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Loreal keeps this product on the shelves and possibly adds some additional scents, perhaps something less perfume like....Years ago I tried the Aussie shampoos and had to stop due to the strong scent.....A nice light scent is preferred for me.</li>
    <li> Firstly, while I love the smell of vanilla the scent of this is way too strong and lasts forever. My hair took easily twice the amount of time to dry. I tried it a couple times and then threw the bottle away.</li>
    <li> This cleansing creme does not strip your hair. This is one of my staple products. I try to buy at least 3 at a time because I&#x27;m so scared they are gonna change the ingredients as they do sometimes when you start liking stuff. This stuff is awesome and will have your hair feeling like pure silk. Love love this stuff. Go Loreal!!!</li>
    <li> I sure hope L&#x27;Oreal reads these reviews, so they don&#x27;t stop making this amazing product! I have used Wen for years, but after buying $200 + shipping for a Wen gallon last year, I decided to look for a less expensive alternative. The Hair One cleansing conditioner (supposed to work like Wen) from Sally Beauty didn&#x27;t cut it, not did tons of super moisturizing regular shampoos and conditioners-they all make my colored, coarse hair have flyaways. I came upon Evercreme while searching for a cheaper Wen. It is always sold out in stores, so I bought through Amazon. WOW. It works BETTER than Wen on my hair, and SO much cheaper! The kicker is, I can use much less than I did with Wen also, as the amount disbursed per pump is much less with Evercreme then Wen&#x27;s regular pump. I use about 15 pumps (which isn&#x27;t very much product in your palm when you see it), and my hair shimmers and shines like a model&#x27;s! It has never looked or felt this good. NO flyways at all, even in the thick of a VT winter. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used WEN for a few months now, and to try to save a few (or more) dollars, I tried this. It did the job, and there was no dryness like other people mentioned. It was easy to use, easy to wash out, but the pump bottle took quite a  bit before I had enough product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real downside though was the smell.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but this product to me smelled like rancid plastic under the vanilla scent.</li>
    <li> I wanted to write a review when I first started using this, but I decided to wait until I used up the whole bottle before I did to see if I still loved it. Well, I just finished the bottle (lasted me exactly 1 month) and I still do love it! I have shoulder length, medium textured hair and it has always just looked blah. I watched the infomercials for Wen, but couldn&#x27;t really afford it. I searched for it on Amazon to read the reviews and found the L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Conditioner. My local Target carried it for 5.99 so I got a bottle to try. After reading all the reviews I knew to make sure my hair was VERY wet and I used about 10 pumps. I left it on about 3 minutes, then made sure I rinsed it very thoroughly. I am not in love with the smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it. In fact, I don&#x27;t really notice it much anymore. But I do love how soft and shiny it makes my hair! I can run my fingers through it all day and it no longer gets static. I use Natural Instincts 30 day color on my hair and this month when I got close to time to color again I got a bad sunburn in my part so I had to wait until it had healed so I wouldn&#x27;t burn my scalp. Well, my roots were showing, but the rest of my hair color was still looked fantastic 2 weeks after I would normally have colored it! After a month of use, I have figured out that I only need 8 pumps for my hair. Having it last exactly 1 month, the cost is right at what I would have spent on shampoo and conditioner. I just love this product! Try it! Follow all the tips people have shared and give it a chance to figure out exactly how much you should use on your particular type and length of hair. Make sure to rinse it thoroughly, especially your scalp! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I get it, there is virtually no suds as I expected.  But I did not realize that I would feel like I can&#x27;t use enough to get my hair clean.  This may be a personal thing, we are used to putting a huge glob of shampoo in our hand and getting really sudsy and calling it clean.  I used 15 pumps the first time, used 10 pumps a couple times.  Decided this fancy shampoo wasn&#x27;t going to last long at that rate and cut back to just 5 pumps.  I only use it twice a week, use moisturizing shampoo the other times.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, the two weeks I used it exclusively I did not feel it left my hair improved or moisturized.</li>
    <li> Makes hair very soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Great product especially for curly thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell (vanilla cream).&lt;br /&gt;As good or better than Wen.</li>
    <li> i had to do a whole nother review on this and give it only one star cuz i wanted to update and give it another chance. i wanted to like it, and use it again....but i couldnt stand the smell!! dont get me wrong it smells nice but wow its too strong!! it cleaned my hair pretty good too and who knows if it really wouldve improved it over time but i couldnt even sleep at night, i woke up at 3 am and all i could smell was that musky scent. not even a perfume like \\&quot;Alien Absolute\\&quot; which is very strong can compete. i surprised i didnt get a headache, but i was nearly nauseous....i never had a product that i had to throw away cuz of the smell, its the first one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to any Loreal people reading this: please make this w/ another scent thats less strong, or at least tone it down! i smelled ur other shampoos and conditioners and they had a fresh smell. i would definitely buy it if it had no scent or a toned-down smell...thanks</li>
    <li> This product was a great cleansing conditioner - left my hair soft, manageable, and clean. However, the smell is so horrendous that I would never ever repurchase. It was difficult to even finish the bottle. It is an extremely strong chemical vanilla smell. Once my hair is dry it&#x27;s not terribly strong anymore so I was able to stand it but honestly I don&#x27;t know how anyone could take the smell. I switched to a different product purely for that reason. So unfortunate - if they changed the scent I&#x27;d be hooked!</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo, much better than Wen. Wen burns my scalp, this shampoo is very gentle and leaves my hair moisturizer and soft. I live in the desert and it dries my hair making it look like straw. But after using this, it looks great.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this shampoo is no comparison to Wen. I thought everyone was exaggerating but the smell is absolutely disgusting! I tried to use it twice and it washed my hair only ok, felt like there was some residue, took a ton of it to get through my hair and like I said- the smell. It does not smell like vanilla.. I don&#x27;t even know what to call it, I felt disgusted using it. Spend the money for the real deal, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> To start: hair is about bra strap length, fine, between wavy and straight. I am growing out hair that was bleached a shade or two lighter, so I have half a head of been-bleached hair and half a head of natural hair. (Super attractive. Not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But oh, L&#x27;oreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not long ago I wrote a fairly negative review of [[ASIN:B002PBC9Y2 L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Reconstruct Conditioner]]. The general verdict: full of heavy waxes to mimic the appearance of fuller, stronger, healthier hair. As I called it, it was \\&quot;all style and no substance.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this line was so highly recommended to me by friends that I felt I should try it. I&#x27;ve wanted to convert to using a cleansing conditioner, anyhow. I tried it once and wasn&#x27;t impressed. My hair felt kind of dry and a little tangled. I couldn&#x27;t really figure out why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, except this has rubbing alcohol in it. \\&quot;Isopropyl alcohol\\&quot; is indeed on its ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? There is no reason. Rubbing alcohol is not good for your hair or scalp in any sense of the word. It is astringent and drying. I assume this may be included as part of the \\&quot;cleansing,\\&quot; but that&#x27;s just silly. Also, behentrimonium chloride, a cleanser, is a known and accepted skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I sound pretty angry, but honestly, I am. There&#x27;s only one hair product requiring alcohol, and that&#x27;s hairspray. [[ASIN:B001DJ2USM L&#x27;Oreal Paris Elnett Satin Hairspray, Extra Strong Hold, 11 Ounce]] is a good example. I&#x27;ll admit that I like to use it, the few times a year I go for hairspray. Alcohol dissolves after a while, allowing for a fine, misting application. They make alcohol-free hairsprays, but due to their pump application, they often have a more uneven application. I understand its use in hairspray. I certainly don&#x27;t understand its use in \\&quot;conditioner.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the scent is intolerably strong. It&#x27;s like shoving bits of sugar cookies and baby powder up your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget it, L&#x27;Oreal. I&#x27;ll continue to buy Elnett but you&#x27;ve otherwise lost my patronage. Maybe try making something good for hair instead of bad for it.</li>
    <li> Meh.  The smell was too strong and I had to use copius amounts of this to get it through my hair.  The cleansing level worked well if my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy.  So if you like to wash your hair every day or every other day, this is probably a good product for you.  If you are like me and don&#x27;t wash your hair very often, your hair will still feel greasy/have build-up after using this product.</li>
    <li> Really, really impressed with this.  I have long, blonde, semi-thick and wavy hair.  I wash my hair every two to three days. I love using this on all of my hair then putting just a touch of sulfate free shampoo on the roots.  I comb it through while all in my hair.  Leaves hair fuller and softer, especially when used several times.  I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair, but most of the time.  Far, far better than Wen, and much easier and faster to use.  My next favorite cleansing conditioner is Lisa Rachel for dry hair.  But this is still faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, side note.  I was in the hospital for several months after having strokes.  Using a cleansing conditioner was great there, because only had to out one thing on my hair and ask the tech to comb it and rinse it.  After getting out of the hospital, it has proven to be great since I use less energy.  I do shower seated and with a handheld thing. But I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it greasy since I can only wash it every few days.  Just a side note for any that might be in that situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like with all cleansing conditioners, it might take a few washes to get your hair and scalp used to not being stripped of oils.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and was thrilled to find it online at a reasonable price.  Can&#x27;t buy in the store anymore.</li>
    <li> Bought this at the local drugstore since I have tried Wen products before and wanted to move away from sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing and the price is right. Yes, you have to use a bit more than you would of regular shampoo and yes, you do have do rub it in to get that low lather. Sulfates are horrible for you and your skin and this doesn&#x27;t have but works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tossed out my conditioners because there is no need for the extra step. Just remember to be generous with the amount you use and take an extra minute or two to enjoy the luscious vanilla, toasted almond smell.</li>
    <li> My hair feel clean with third wash but i still need to use a conditioner... its just a shampoo sustitute for me but anyway i like it. The smell, dont dry my hair...i&#x27;ll use it like a shampoo</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really change my hair problems and made my hair feel greasy at the scalp. I gave it a month and couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. Super yuck.</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair without drying it out, feels good.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing conditioner. It&#x27;s very mild, with no sudsing, which I&#x27;ve come to really enjoy. It cleans the hair well but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling stripped of moisture, nor does it leave it feeling heavy or coated. It&#x27;s a nice time saver, too, since the washing ritual is halved. The scent is pretty, too, mildly floral, maybe with hints of vanilla. This is one of the few products where I&#x27;ve used it up a few times and purchased more.</li>
    <li> Waaaayyy to smelly and a sickly sweet overpowering odor. Made me nauseated. I gave my bottle to a friend with a warning...</li>
    <li> I like this well enough, its very similar to hair one and wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is not my favorite, more similar to a perfume then a conditioner.  I like that its a cleanser as well as a conditioner but the product hair one is better for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleansing conditioner because I had gotten hooked on Wen quite a while back but really felt that for me personally it was too expensive to keep using it long term.  Which brought me to try the L&#x27;Oreal cleansing conditioner.  It seems to me that it takes a few more pumps than the Wen to really get through all my hair.  (It&#x27;s quite thick and long)...So while it seems initially a better deal it does take a tiny bit more for me to get my hair clean.  Generally I like it.  It seemed to work as well as the Wen--cleaned it but yet didn&#x27;t dry it out.  My hair is soft, too.  I have one thing I do not like so much--the scent.  Kind of pleasant in a way but much too strong for me.  Mostly it has been family members who smell it.  My daughter was like, &amp;#34;What perfume are you wearing?  It&#x27;s kind of like an old strong perfume smell.&amp;#34;  If I have to pick a product to compare to Wen I would probably go with the Hair One brand over this one so far.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal needs to stop over perfuming the products , our senses are overloaded it&#x27;s getting hard to breathe . Is there ever any just fresh air to breathe I&#x27;m sick of it . this stuff stinks . I threw it in the garbage as soon as I took a whiff Not fresh and clean smelling</li>
    <li> I am 48 years old with fine, color-treated, oily hair.  I thought this would be an option to clean but not dry my hair.  It&#x27;s okay but I don&#x27;t think it cleans great.  I usually wash my hair every 2 days.  When I use this, I have to wash every day because at the end of the day my hair begins to look greasy.  Also, it seems to take a lot of product to go all through my hair (shoulder length, fine and straight)...probably 10-15 pumps.  If you have thick or long hair, you would go through this small bottle very quickly.</li>
    <li> Smells horribly chemical.  Like perm solution.  It also requires a lot for it to be spread throughout hair.</li>
    <li> So here is the thing, if you have big bucks this is a great product because it works better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I do notice a difference in my scalp (less itchy more clean) when I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;For me being a cheapskate the problem is value.&lt;br /&gt;This is a pump bottle and for me, a guy with short hair, when I use this as my only cleanser&lt;br /&gt;for the entire shower it takes about 20 pumps to do my hair and body.  Seems excessive.&lt;br /&gt;But I guess to get some dangerous chemicals out of the shower it will be worth it for those with dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Currently this product is not in my budget even though it is healthier.  :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and co-washes.  This is as good as any and is reasonable cost.  I have fine hair and it does not leave a heavy coating on my hair.  Good shine and bounce when dry.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how much I liked this product.  I did not find the scent so unpleasant I would not use it.. but yes it has a hint of plastic/vanilla to it.  It does not bother me at all and I am sensitive to scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has such a nice feel .g.  Coated and protected when washing, yet it rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses well.  The little pump does not bother me much as I don&#x27;t need that many pumps for Collarbone length fine hair.  I find a little goes a long way on my hair.  It removes oil from my hair (I do coconut oil masks overnight) and does not leave my hair greasy feeling or lank.&lt;br /&gt;I wash hair 5 times a week and add cowashes to my rotation to give hair a break.  This product fits the bill. I used to use VO5 for the cowashes but I am happily adding this one into the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I am always on the lookout for sulfate-free shampoos/cleansing conditioners, because I know sulfate is what strips my hair of my salon color. I pay good money to get my hair done so why would I want to use a product that only sends that money down the drain before the 8 weeks is up? I have bought so many products to help combat my thin, dry, wavy and extremely frizzy hair. I have used Wen and really didn&#x27;t notice a difference (besides the price tag) after 30 days. So, that one was out. I liked the concept of Wen though and have used numerous other \\&quot;cleansing conditioners\\&quot;, but haven&#x27;t liked any of them. Until this one. I paid $6.99 at Kroger and know I can find it cheaper so that hunt begins!  I still have trouble fighting frizz even with this product AND Frizz Ease, but my hair feels softer and conditioned. I am so grateful to Loreal for putting this great product on the market! I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I tried three different sulfate-free \\&quot;cleansing conditions\\&quot; and found this  L&#x27;Oreal one to be the best for my hair type, which is baby-fine, worn shoulder length and slightly layered. The other two that I tried were Wen, both the cucumber and lavender versions, and the Lisa Rachel Conditioner &amp; Cleanser for Damaged Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my assessment of each one: Wen was great as a conditioner, but my hair was droopy and greasy-looking by mid-morning. After shampooing with a different shampoo, Wen worked really well as a conditioner only on the day after I had my hair highlighted. Otherwise it weighed down my hair too much. The second cleansing conditioner I tried was the Lisa Rachel one listed above, and it cleaned my hair very well, yet oddly enough did nothing to condition it. I really wanted both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the third one I tried was L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s sulfate-free cleansing conditioner and I was hooked from the very first try. It both cleaned and conditioned my baby-fine hair and it looks great all day, no limp tresses here! I use it 6 days a week and then once a week I wash my hair with Neutrogena&#x27;s Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo, since I use hair products most days, then condition it briefly with the L&#x27;Oreal  cleansing conditioner. My hair is so shiny and my hairdresser constantly comments on how beautifully healthy my hair is. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have had \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; purple highlights for years and I&#x27;ve always, no matter what Color Safe Shampoo/Conditioner I used, had problems keeping the color from fading past 5-6 weeks.  Using this conditioner, my color has lasted for almost 4 months!  It&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback, and L&#x27;Oreal could fix this if they wanted to, is that the pump-action bottle is SO inefficient. It takes me 25 (TWENTY-FIVE) pumps to get enough out for my hair. And you can&#x27;t even pump it fast, the pump needs to reset for I&#x27;d say 4-5 seconds before it will let you pump out another of the same amount (even if I push it back up manually). I&#x27;ve resorted to trying to squeeze it out into another bottle, a squeeze bottle, to save time - but that does end up leaving some in the original bottle, which is a waste :(  And all the other Ever-whatsits come in squeeze bottles!  WHY NOT THIS ONE?</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite shampoo. I use it almost every day. My hair has never looked so shiny! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 months ago.  I think this is dependent on your hair type (dry, greasy etc) and your water.  My hair is dry and I have hard water.  This product has worked wonders on my hair.  It is not dry or frizzy any longer and not to mention super soft!  It holds a style all day with very little effort on my part.  Prior to this my hair would always go limp or get very frizzy during the day.  My hair is shoulder length and although the bottle does not specify how much to use, I use about 3/4 of a tablespoon most days.  I rub it on my scalp and work it though the hair. I do not use the large amounts others have posted..I find a little goes a long way if you rub it into a paste in your hands before putting on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting use to not having the suds, I use regular shampoo once a week.  The dispenser itself could use a little work, kind of a pain to pump.  Not sure why they did not put this in a tube.  I am going to try the other Everpure products because I like this one so much.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a hair wash that will not dry out my scalp/hair for the past two years since I decided to go natural. I first used Terressentials Mud Wash, it worked really well on my hair, but it was too expensive for my college budget and also messes up my tub. Then after a few months of using regular shampoo, I went to CVS to try and found something else that would help my hair and saw this stuff, so i decided to give it a try. It was a tiny bottle for $7 but totally worth it! My hair smells amazing, my curls are shiny and defined, and my hair is not dry! The only thing that sucks is the small bottle! I finished this stuff in about three weeks cause I need to use so much! I need to order this stuff in bulk!</li>
    <li> I really gave this stuff a shot. I have long hair, and I kept increasing the amount I used until I got up to about 20 pumps. I have heard some people say you need to use 40 pumps! That&#x27;s ridiculous. It smells great, but it&#x27;s like putting vanilla scented crisco in your hair. Might as well just dump cake batter on your head. It leaves deposits on the scalp, and makes my hair super greasy.</li>
    <li> Does not really work well for me.  I was hopeful this product would work because it is less expensive than others, but it did not.</li>
    <li> Have to make sure you wash it all out, but it leaves hair soooo soft! Skip shampooing and rinse with this, and all done!</li>
    <li> I have been using Alterna Caviar Moisture shampoo/conditioner and spending $60 every other month. I saw an infomercial for Wen and was curious to see what it could do for my hair. I figured $30 was half what I usually spent so why not. After doing some research I heard that L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme Cleansing Conditioner gave people the same or similar results to Wen for a fraction of the cost. I figured for 6 bucks why not give it a try. I read reviews and took the advice of using a LOT of product. This was definitely good advice! I use a handful and massage it into my scalp (it does NOT lather so think of it more as a lotion for your hair). I don&#x27;t even need to apply it to my ends because it conditions them enough when it rinses out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, color treated, damaged hair that is naturally curly/wavy/a bit frizzy. After 3 weeks of using this product my hair air dries 50% straighter and with almost zero frizz. I usually look like a combed out poodle if I don&#x27;t heat style so this is a major improvement. I also usually only wash my hair every other to every two days because it gets so easily damaged. However, I can&#x27;t really get away with every two days anymore because this cleansing conditioner does make my hair look greasy by then. I wash it every other day and it looks fantastic. I feel comfortable washing it more often because I know I&#x27;m not stripping the oils from my hair with a shampoo. I was blown away when I switched to Alterna, but my hair has never been healthier than when I switched to this L&#x27;Oreal product. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin, straight hair.  Scalp gets oily but ends are dry.  This gives so much more of a healthy look to my hair that I can wear my hair down and casual and it doesn&#x27;t look stringy.  I actually think it looks great for once after many years.  My trick is to use a Small amount of a sulfate free shampoo first on my bangs and crown.  Rinse that out and then do the L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Conditioner all over my head.  Work it in well and pack it to my head while I shower my body.  Make sure it has been on at least a few minutes, more is better.  Rinse Well and Wa La I&#x27;m loving the results this way.  I can actually grow my hair now instead of chopping off all my frustrations.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good! Puts me in mind of Bath and Body&#x27;swarm vanilla sugar lotion. Is very rich and my hair feels so nice after I use it. Actually my hair is squeaky clean after using it. It goes a long way for the size of the bottle, but it is important to wet hair thoroughly and use enough product. I am a subscribe customer and am so glad to have found a product that does not strip my dry hair of moisture but also cleans it well. And of course the scent is heavenly to me!</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!!!!!!! Please note, this is NOT &#x27;shampoo&#x27; in the usual sense of the word.  However, what it IS is totally awesome.  For comparison, I have straight hair, can go for a few days without washing before it becomes gross / oily.  I have noticed a huge difference in the way my scalp and hair feel.  Scalp: feels soft, doesn&#x27;t itch! Hair: SUPER soft, shiny, less oil production it seems.  Hard to explain, but basically, because you&#x27;re not stripping the natural oils out of your scalp every day, your scalp&#x27;s production of oil seems to regulate, and so despite the fact that you&#x27;re not &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34;, your hair will likely feel LESS oily.  I love this product.  Use a good amount - 4-5 pumps, depending on how long your hair is, etc.  Massage that into your scalp and give it a good &amp;#34;salon washing&amp;#34;.  This product doesn&#x27;t lather!!  has a nice vanilla scent to it.  HIGHLY recommend this!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years now and I went to place an order on Amazon and thought I should put my 2 cents in. I have long wavy medium coarse hair that I color regularly so it is a little on the dry side. I use mousse or beach spray on it to bring out the waves.&lt;br /&gt;Before I wash my hair I try to rinse it out thoroughly to get most of the products out.  Then I use a palm full of this and I part my hair at the roots in the back, put most of it there then distribute the rest on my roots/scalp, massage it well and then work it down to the ends. I only wash my hair every two or three days and then about twice a month I use a clarifying shampoo (Neutrogena) to really get all the products out and a thick conditioner (also Neutrogena) to detangle and soften it. When I go to have my hair cut my stylist always goes on about how soft and healthy my hair is!  I love this product and the smell (and the price) and will continue to use it regularly. Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> i threw the ever creme in the garbage.  icky yellow color and greasy texture.  i would never our it near my hair.</li>
    <li> I always read instructions so am pretty sure I have been using as directed.  The low-sudsing, which they warn you about on the label, did bother me a bit but also it felt slightly greasy both during use and afterwards.  I do like the light fragrance and my hair seems clean, but I just don&#x27;t think this is the right shampoo for me.  The bottle is still nearly full so will use it up and maybe will change my mind. If so, I&#x27;ll come in here and edit this.</li>
    <li> I have very course, dry naturally curly hair.  The type of hair that dries naturally in small ringlets if I apply a gel to my hair after shampooing and conditioning and allowing to air dry, but then quickly frizzes all over if it is disturbed in anyway.  I was really happy when I found and purchased Wen products here on Amazon to help with my problem hair.  The only problem with Wen was that I can not afford to keep it on hand, so I have been frantically searching for a similar product. I found out about L&#x27;Oreal Paris cleansing conditioner while reading a review on some other hair product.  I looked up this product and ordered it and have been so very happy that I did.  While using the product it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling quite as slick and silky as the Wen did when washing and rinsing it out, but I really do think that my hair is healthier on this product.  My hair is not as prone to friz as it was prior to using this L&#x27;Oreal product.  It leaves my hair feeling very soft and is easy to comb through after shampooing.  Like the Wen product it does not really lather like other shampoos do which my be disconcerting to someone if they are used to having lots of suds.  I have also been using 100% Virgin Argon Oil on my hair after shampooing or before I expose it to the heat of my flat iron or hot air curling brush.  I am so very happy with my hair now and my husband loves it too. I find myself all the time running my fingers through my hair.</li>
    <li> I loved this for about a month, but I found after about two months that my hair started to get very filmy.  When I first started using it, I got great results.  The wave in my hair got bouncier, my hair felt soft, looked great, etc.  I may not have been using it correctly, but after a couple of months of repeated use, my hair started to feel filmy and like it needed to be washed.  Also, I have very long, very thick hair, and I had to use a TON of this stuff to coat all of my hair.  I know some people swear by this stuff, so I can&#x27;t completely discount it -- I&#x27;ll just say it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I began in December of 2012 searching for help for my hair.  I was desperate; due to occasional perms and coloring my hair, I had begun to have extensive breakage which resulted in my hair becoming thinner.  It was also dry. I tried Wen Sweet Almond cleansing shampoo, and was thankful after each shampoo that I had done so. My hair began to improve after the very first use. There was less breakage and more shine to my hair, but the very best result was that my broken strands began to grow back in.  In just two weeks, there was a drastic improvement in my hair. As I neared an empty bottle, did more research, read more reviews, I was searching for something less expensive than Wen, but I wanted it to be just as effective. I tried Hair One Cleansing Shampoo based on reviews, and the properties of the product.  It was o.k., but did not do for my hair what Wen had accomplished.  My hair was drier with Hair One than with Wen.  After using Wen, I could not go back to my hair being the way it originally was, even if it meant a budget change for me.  Because I use L&#x27;Oreal products exclusively on my skin, and I subscribe to the automatic shipment on those products, I was at Amazon adding two more of those products to my subscription.  AND IT WAS THEN THAT I SAW L&#x27;OREAL EVERCREME CLEANSING CONDITIONER. The reviews were so great for this product that I thought, \\&quot;Well, I will try this for my hair..It could work for me, since I know from years of experience that L&#x27;Oreal facial products are the best for me.\\&quot;  THESE ARE MY FINDINGS:  From $34-39 for Wen Cleanser Shampoo, to $14.95? for Hair One Cleansing Shampoo to $5.97(and less with my subscription orders), for L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner (8.3 ounces), and I can positively and honestly say that I like L&#x27;Oreal even more than I like Wen!  That is not said lightly, because there were certain criteria that had to be met after my wonderfully positive experience with Wen Cleanser Shampoo; after blow drying my hair after shampooing with the L&#x27;Oreal, and before doing ANYTHING ELSE in my routine, my hair had a glow, and something in all of my life I had never seen with my hair, it was full looking and it was bouncy! I have a bit more than average amount of hair but it is so fine.  So the fullness and bounce was totally new for me and unexpected. Also, there is one other thing that I can&#x27;t explain, but I will describe it:  On the right side, there was an area(about 2\\&quot;x2\\&quot;) near the top of my hair that was very dry and brittle looking even after all the good things that have happened to my hair sine January, 2013.  I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED BUT THAT HAIR LOOKS LIKE THE REST OF MY HAIR!  I took the time tonight after shampooing my hair for church tomorrow to write this review.  These results have occurred after three(3) shampoos!  I have been helped so many times by the reviews that I have read for the items that I buy through Amazon, that I was compelled to share my experience in the hope that someone will be helped.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product that was just as good as Wen and this is it.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> sadly, I tried this lower end priced cleansing conditioner, as I am on a fixed budget.  I used one day, just rinsed with water the next.  I felt my hair getting &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; and I thought it meant this was working and my hair was getting healthy.  Sadly on day 7, just a rinse day.  I happened to run my hand through my hair and it felt dirty, I looked in the mirror and was disgusted.  I had hair that looked as if it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week.  there was no constant build up, just all of a sudden....I felt so icky, I took another shower within a couple of hours and used my old shampoo.  Clean again, on to another product.  I&#x27;m not saying this won&#x27;t work for others, it certainly did not work for me :(</li>
    <li> This my first time using a cleansing conditioner.  I like the results but the smell of this is a bit strong.  I&#x27;ll still use it though.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t count all the ways I love this L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCreme Sulfate-Free Moisture System Cleansing Conditioner!!!  I&#x27;d been struggling with the way shampoos continually left my hair like straw, no matter what type of conditioner I used after I shampooed--I was really becoming desperate, since I had been trying to let my hair grow down passed my shoulders, yet the terrible condition of the ends kept me continually trimming them off, due to dryness--I&#x27;d tried lots of popular brands of shampoo, too, including one I thought was &#x27;the bomb&#x27;, it was so popular--but, it was no better than any of the other shampoos I&#x27;d ever tried over the years--I was completely disappointed in them ALL!--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--when I first spotted this product here on Amazon.com, I read through all the reviews I could, and I was surprised at what others had to say about these types of non-shampoo conditioners!--I wondered if it would actually help my poor hair, so that I didn&#x27;t need to resort to cutting it short in self-defense!--but, it not containing ANY shampoo made me cringe, because I couldn&#x27;t understand how it could not only condition my hair, but also clean it!--but, out of desperation, I decided to trust those who&#x27;d raved about it, and I bought two bottles of it, plus a L&#x27;Oreal Leave-In Conditioner to go along with it, just in case my hair still needed it--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--now, I can safely say that I have never been more pleased with any hair cleaning product I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life!--and, this cleans exactly as they say it will, too!--I&#x27;ve also been using the L&#x27;Oreal Leave-In Conditioner after I&#x27;ve rinsed out the Cleansing Conditioner, but I&#x27;m now finding that I can use less and less of the leave-in conditioner, since the Cleansing Conditioner is doing such a superior job at cleaning, and softening my hair all by itself!--not to mention the increased body it&#x27;s given my now-thinning hair thanks to my advancing age[I&#x27;m 64]--to me, it&#x27;s been such a blessing to have found this L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Conditioner, and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.Cleansing Conditioner, and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> This is a decent substitute for Wen. It doesn&#x27;t have the nice smell, and I wouldn&#x27;t say it is just as good, but for the price it is not bad. Like Wen, it kept my hair from being dry and frizzy. I may buy it again, or I may spring for the high priced stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of WEN, so I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a try since it&#x27;s way cheaper. It works great. My hair is soft and happy. But the smell is horrible. I suppose it doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;m pregnant. It&#x27;s way too strong though, and I can&#x27;t stand getting a major whiff of the nasty scent whenever I move my head. I&#x27;m going to look for another cleansing conditioner. If Loreal can do something about the dreadful scent, I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> I love what this product does for my hair (and for that price! WHAT?!). I even love the scent and don&#x27;t mind that I have to use 6 pumps on my chin length hair. My hair is thin, flat, wavy, frizzy, and damaged from coloring all at the same time and this stuff made it look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT (and this is a giant but), it made my face and my back break out. I started to get a lot of little pimples all around my hairline and my forehead as well as some pretty massive ones down the middle of my back. Mind you, I do have acne prone skin, but haven&#x27;t had an issue with any of my shampoos/conditioners before. I was really hoping it wasn&#x27;t this that was causing it but, sure enough, when I stopped using it the problem went away within just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choice between bad skin or \\&quot;eh\\&quot; hair is an easy one for me. Farewell evercreme cleansing conditioner...I hardly knew ye...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (7/6/13): My review for this still stands but I just wanted to note that I have since tried Wen and pretty much had the same issue. Wen did not cause the same breakouts on my hairline and forehead but did cause body acne flare ups for me (which have actually taken LONGER to clear up than when I used this product! Arg!). I can&#x27;t say that Wen worked any better for the price - it was thicker and \\&quot;lathered\\&quot; better (and I like Wen&#x27;s scents better), but my hair felt pretty much the same. I&#x27;ve done some investigating online and it seems like the breakouts happen to a lot of people. But if you&#x27;re not one of them, you&#x27;re in luck!</li>
    <li> I am a wen user and have tried the wen like products with pretty awful results.  decided to try this as it is not expensive and must say it is really great. left my hair soft and the waves intact without being frizzy. the ONLY thing that will keep me from becoming a loyal customer is the god awful smell.  it is very musky and heavy and gave me a headache... sort of like old lady perfume in your hair....really gross.  BUT if you like that scent or are not bothered by it, give this a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff has an amazing scent, leaves my hair clean without feeling stripped, only smooth and soft.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner anymore - don&#x27;t need it, even though I, um, enhance my natural hair color.  My stick straight hair has far fewer fly aways.  I&#x27;ll never go back to shampoos with sulphates.</li>
    <li> My hair takes forever to wash and condition. It is thick, curly, dried out and downright unruly.  Washing it would just make it more tangled than it was to begin with, and then I would have to use massive amounts of conditioner and time to untangle it. I was searching for a new shampoo when I came across this product on Amazon. It was about $6, and I usually spend double that amount on shampoo alone, so I figured I&#x27;ll give it a try. Well, my first experience with the cleansing conditioner was a bit disappointing since I did not know that it would not really lather. Since it is a cleansing conditioner, it is only 1/4 cleanser. (Feel free to correct me if I am wrong). The rest moisturizes your hair. Therefore, it won&#x27;t lather up like normal shampoos. Some tips for using this cleansing conditioner are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a clarifying or regular shampoo first if your hair is full of styling product (In my experience, the cleansing conditioner is not strong enough to take these products out of your hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you really soak your hair in water before you apply the product (Water helps the product to lather up a bit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find out what number of pumps work best for you (If  you have short hair, 8-10 pumps may be enough. I need about 16-18 pumps for my hair, but it is thick and about 5 inches past my shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the product is lathered, I leave it on for a minute or two and then add a splash of water. This helps when I go to detangle my hair, which is a breeze now with this product. After detangling, I simply rinse it out with cool water for another minute (some people may need to rinse longer since people with finer hair may notice a feeling of residue). The scent to me is delicious, a bit like coconut and vanilla mixed together. Scents usually bother me, but this one does not. The only thing that I wish I could change is the pump bottle, because I use so many pumps. It would help if it were in a tube instead.</li>
    <li> I have tried WEN, but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep using it because it was so expensive. This product works just as well, but smells so much better! My hair is no longer dehydrated, and I can justify the price of this product.</li>
    <li> I am a Wen Cleanser user and thought i would try this to see if it would work&lt;br /&gt;well.  I did not like the results. Hair is flat and the odor is too strong and&lt;br /&gt;overpowering like some of the other reviews stated.  I cannot recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product.....the only reason why I did not rate it 5 stars is because of the smell! I have never been a fan of vanilla scents and this definitely smells a lot like vanilla.....I&#x27;ve used it now a few times and it leaves my hair soft, shiny, so light! I&#x27;ve been a user of wen and was hoping I would find something similiar to it and I did!! Wen is great but it is expensive...at least for me it is, I have long hair so I need to use a lot of pumps, the 16oz bottle only lasted me about a week and a half! So if u are looking for an alternative to wen  please do give this a try, I&#x27;ve read some bad reviews on here about this product and I wonder if people are not doing it right, remember this is not a shampoo and you will not get a lather, you will have to really massage this stuff into your hair.....I have actually washed it twice, first I use abt 10 pumps and really massage it into my hair leave it on for about 3 mins and then rinse, then I will apply half of the pumps(5) and re-wash my hair and then rinse again.... It cleans my hair and it really moisturizes it, ladies just give this a try, u won&#x27;t be disappointed!:-)</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that never holds a style for long. This somehow gives my hair more volume and staying power:)  Leaves hair very soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I am seriously in love with this stuff. I&#x27;ve used Wen for about a year but the price was killing me, and plus wen made my hair feel really greasy after awhile. I looked around for a wen alternative and found this, I thought for 5.99 a bottle it couldn&#x27;t be that great, but decided I would give it a try. Let me just say its amazing so amazing and for me I actually like it way better than Wen. I LOVE the smell, I don&#x27;t understand how people hate it. And I love that it leaves my damaged fine thin hair, feeling moisturizing but yet not greasy! I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of it, I&#x27;ll probably buy 3 or 4 bottles next time I&#x27;m out because it&#x27;s so cheap compared to wen. And for people who say \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know how much to use blah blah\\&quot; Um..Common sense you make sure you use enough to cover your entire head, and don&#x27;t go cheap and only use alittle of it because then it won&#x27;t clean your hair. I hope everyone tries this, and I hope L&#x27;Oreal never ever discontinues this!!!!</li>
    <li> i really do like this product. it works really well with my dry hair &amp; hair extensions.  i have experienced what people complained about with the greasy factor, but then figured out i simply had not rinsed it well enough. overall i do believe it is working much better than my expensive shampoos &amp; conditioners. i do use a small amount of leave in conditioner at times to help with all the heat i subject my hair to. also if you have hair extensions that get really tangled, this may help.:)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it cleaned badly, and seemed to do a good job of smoothing my hair and it had shine. I just can&#x27;t get past the horrible smell! I washed my hair and blow-dried it before I went to bed, and the first thing I smelled in the morning was my hair. And I continued to smell it the rest of the day. It was awful! I hate musk scents as do a lot of women. Why do these companies think I want everything I buy to have the scent of perfume, and musk in particular? And this is really, really bad! Come out with a nice clean citrus scent, or better yet, no scent at all, and I&#x27;ll try it again. For now, I&#x27;m planning to try to get my money back.</li>
    <li> I found it to be just as good as other more expensive products that I have used in the past. My hair is soft, shiny and smells wonderful. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product at the local drug store.  The price on Amazon is great.  I love the subscribe and save products.  I also like the fact that it really does work.  It is a much better price than Wen hair products.  It works just the same.  I have had three different people try it and they say that they really like the convenience.  It&#x27;s kind of weird if you are used to having a shampoo that foams up a lot.  But I think it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I just discovered cleansing conditioners and started out with this L&#x27;Oreal one. The performance of this product is very good, and it gets the product buildup out of my hair while leaving it very soft and shiny. However, the strong vanilla-y scent isn&#x27;t appealing to me, and seems to stay in my hair throughout the day even when I rinse thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and bought L&#x27;Oreal EverCreame Cleansing Conditioner, and I love it.  I had read quite a few bad reviews on it, but sometimes what works for one person, might now work for another, so I had to at least give it a try. I worked the product into my hair real good, (it made my hair feel like silk); and then let it set while I washed my face and body...then I combed through my hair with a wide tooth comb, and rinsed.  Never has my hair felt so clean. I don&#x27;t normally like the strong vanilla scent that is in a lot of perfumes, but I really liked the vanilla scent in this product; reminded me of Vanilla Lace perfume from Victoria Secrets, which I love!  It&#x27;s been hard for me to find a good product for my hair, especially since I started going through menopause early, and I have thin unmanageable hair, so to have L&#x27;Oreal evercream Cleansing Conditioner work so well for me, makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005HIH7YM L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, 8.3 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> this stuff just plain stinks! Yes my hair feels better after using it but it smells so overwhelming that I will not buy it again. If they would just change the awful smell!</li>
    <li> This product has a repulsive and nauseating odor.  I followed the directions on the label and the end result was that my fine, color-treated hair was so greasy.  Totally unacceptable. I used the rest of it to shave my legs. L&#x27;Oreal, please go back to the drawing board.  Both your formulation and your fragrance are unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, after using this cleanser, I had the chance to try Wen and loved everything about it but the price.  Now I see that Clairol Herbal Essence has a cleansing conditioner, which I&#x27;m sure will smell far better, and there&#x27;s a Pantene formulation as well.  I&#x27;m going to give those a try and will see how they work.</li>
    <li> I am African American with relaxed color treated hair. I was hoping this product would work for me but it did not. It left my hair hard and difficult to manage. When I tried to comb through my hair it was a nightmare. This product has a dishwashing liquid feel, it reminded me of the dishwashing liquid I use. Maybe it works well for others but my hair didn&#x27;t like it at all. I am sticking to VO5 Moisture milk they cost about a $1.00, smell great and work well.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of very think, somewhat coarse, wavy hair. Though it claims to be free of heavy waxes, that is is exactly what it feels like on my hair. I found I had the same issue with the other EverCreme products I tried, so it seems they&#x27;re just not for me. I love the idea of the 2-in-1, it just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair. The EverSleek products are fabulous though!</li>
    <li> I used Wen exclusively for over a year, would supplement with this in between. I realized that I love the smell and the way my hair feels when I use the L&#x27;Oréal.&lt;br /&gt;I have this one on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple other cleansing conditioners and this one is my absolute favorite! I color my hair monthly so it is not in the best of shape but I can use this product and have soft healthy feeling hair. I have also noticed since I started using it that I no longer need to wash my hair daily to get that clean look and feel. I also have very curly/wavy hair this is amazing not to have to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair everyday to have beautiful hair. Awesome this is in my cart all the time now so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle for me and my daughter.  She has always had wavy, puffy hair that tangles easily.  We have always had to put a cream or oil on before blow drying and air drying ALWAYS guaranteed a braid or ponytail. And the tangles when she&#x27;d get up in the morning??!!  UGH!  The first time we used this her hair was straight, smooth and shiny with nearly no tangles.  Its absolutely gorgeous and at her recent birthday party every person that came in to the house asked either her or myself what we had done different to her hair. I have short, thick, color treated but reasonably healthy hair and I found this too heavy for my use but I found [[ASIN:B007MNYY14 Salon Grafix Healthy Hair Nutrition Conditioning Cleanser, Citrus Créme, 12 oz]] works amazing for myself.  I have removed all regular shampoos and conditioners from my shower and we will always have a stock of L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme and Salon Grafix on hand!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this a try for six weeks, and I could kick myself for keeping with it that long. I thought it would be a cheap alternative to Wen, but it&#x27;s just awful. It&#x27;s like putting lotion in your hair. It doesn&#x27;t even cleanse your hair and leaves more of a greasy buildup. I have medium-thick wavy-curly hair, shoulder length. I usually used 4-6 pumps, and this made my hair oily, limp and hard to deal with. I actually had to pull at my hair so much while brushing that I&#x27;ve got split ends! And I&#x27;ve been shedding more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to Mane n&#x27; Tail Herbal Gro hoping it&#x27;ll undo the damage, and after 6 uses it&#x27;s already made a big difference. But nothing will beat getting a haircut, which I plan to do soon. And I can&#x27;t wait to tell my hairdresser about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product!</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle of this heaven in a bottle. I too, wanted to try Wen. I just could not commit to the price. Not just to try, but because I have long, thick hair and I knew it would take a lot of product. I bought this after reading the great reviews. I love it! I do not have to add extra conditioner to my hair. It rinses clean ( I have trouble finding shampoo and condtioner that do not leave me looking greasy.) I use a clarifying shampoo every other week. And my hair cannot be better! Love it! Try it! Worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the idea that it would both be a time-saver, and healthier for my hair than regular shampoo and conditioner. However, its online profile does not say it is best for dry hair, when the bottle does... My hair get oily easily, so I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this product had the dry hair statement been on Amazon. Even right after washing, my hair still felt greasy. The product itself smells like dead flowers soaked in chemicals. Furthermore, a lot of product is required per each use, but the bottle is very small - I don&#x27;t imagine it would last a regular user more than a month. The instructions even say you&#x27;re supposed to rinse down the tub/shower after use, so the next person doesn&#x27;t slip on what is leaves behind. Not a time-saver!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t feel fresh. worth a try.</li>
    <li> It works ok, but the smell is not good. I used it up but vowed never to buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and after using this product I noticed I have to use it more often than regular shampoo because it does not really clean the hair and I still have to use conditioner because the ends don&#x27;t get enough moisture. it is good between regular washes if I go to the beach or have a crazy work because it isn&#x27;t as harsh as regular shampoo but it definitely is not a replacement</li>
    <li> Fantastic...Excellent in comparison to Wen products..Price is unbeatable..Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> really beat my expectations! My hair is so soft and silky. you don&#x27;t need to use a lot either! Will buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a local CVS and I loved it when I first started using it.  I am white with super thick, wavy, and course hair.  I actually had a kids ethnic relaxer put on my hair years ago.  Anyways, I loved the smell of this cleansing conditioner and how my hair felt smooth and not as frizzy.  I could actually let my hair air dry after using it and it wouldn&#x27;t be an afro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this cleansing shampoo does not lather like a normal shampoo would.  I found that by adding a few pumps to 4 or 5 sections of my hair, rubbing it in, and then giving it a quick spray of water here and there while rubbing in, it would lather much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the downside:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2-3 months of using this, I got horrible dandruff!  I would use this and then as soon as I would get out of the shower and look in the mirror, I could see flakes in my wet hair!  I don&#x27;t use many hair products or hairspray so I know that wasn&#x27;t the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I washed my hair, I used head and shoulders and the flakes were gone.  I also had many comments the next day on how shiny my hair looked after using head and shoulders so I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how dull this cleansing conditioner made my hair become.</li>
    <li> First off I must say I HATE the smell of this stuff, yuk!  As far as comparing it to WEN, with my short hair it is a satisfactory imposter, not nearly as good but for 1/4 the price I still use it.  As for my wife , who has a lot of hair it didn&#x27;t work at all, it actually made her hair very frizzy and unmanageable. I still use the WEN once a week or so &amp; really do miss it but for the price I use this on the daily basis.</li>
    <li> My hair: Bra strap length, dyed dark brown every 6-8 weeks, thick, wavy, Caucasian, normal (as in not oily or dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve decided to just give my daily experience with this conditioning cleanser because I hear that it takes an adjustment period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day one: About twelve pumps, vigorous scalp massage and I let it sit about five minutes before rinsing in cool but not cold water. I don&#x27;t notice any change from regular shampoo and conditioner upon drying. As the day progressed I did notice that I was greasier by bedtime. Three stars because of the lack of any difference so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day two: Nine pumps, 10 minutes sit before rinsing in warm water. My hair seems shinier than usual. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem as greasy today as it did yesterday, either. I also noticed that my hair felt different after washing. It wasn&#x27;t as easy to slide my fingers through my hair, when wet it still seemed lighter than usual (I assume that&#x27;s the lack of heavy conditioner I usually use), and my roots felt cleaner. I don&#x27;t know how to really elaborate on the last, but after using conventional conditioned my scalp always felt a bit weighted before whereas with this it seems fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3-7: No big changes, still using the same 9-11 pumps. I did notice that my hair was softer. I thought it was just greasy at first before I realized that was my hair&#x27;s natural grease finally evening out throughout my hair and not just condensed in my roots. It&#x27;s a thoroughly pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 8: First compliment! I had a customer tell me that my hair looked really healthy today, and a coworker tell me my hair looked softer. Huzzah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 9: I have cleansed my hair every day, and believe I&#x27;ve hit the plateau for effects. My hair is shinier than usual, and I was skeptical about the extra body but I am definately seeing it compared to how my hair usually is with traditional shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m really liking the changes. I&#x27;m going to start not using the cleanser every day to see how that affects my hair. I&#x27;m a little nervous about this because of the natural oils in my hair finally taking hold but I have a good feeling it&#x27;ll turn out alright!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m two weeks in now and I love everything about this cleanser. It would seem my limit for not washing my hair is three days, and I&#x27;m still recovering from how greasy my hair got. I&#x27;m hoping that this changes over time and will keep anyone interested updated as to how things are going in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed my ends are getting pretty dry. I&#x27;m pretty certain this is user error as I don&#x27;t really use a ton of the cleanser on my ends, harrumph! I&#x27;ve started using [[ASIN:B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Overnight Treatment, 3.4-Fluid Ounce]] to try and correct this dryness. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but there&#x27;s already a noticeable difference in the lack of flyaways that have been occuring. I&#x27;m hoping this is a sign of good things to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the smell issue that pops up in every review. Yes, I did notice a smell, no it wasn&#x27;t insane. I like to think I have a sensitive nose to odors and the smell of this cleanser is no where near as potent as I was setting myself up to believe. Your hair does smell like the vanilla scent for a while after, but my hair has always retained shampoo/conditioner smell for most of the day after washing so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me. No one else has commented on the smell of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3/07/13&lt;br /&gt;Still loving this product. Pros on my hair: no dandruff! (not that this has ever been a huge problem for me but I just noticed the other day that I wasn&#x27;t shedding ever), roots stay moisturized and healthy for days between cleansing, after initially having to wash my hair every day I have now worked up to 2-3x a week, shinier hair, fuller hair, no residual smell that anyone has noticed in a bad way if at all. Cons: My ends seem to remain dry no matter how much cleanser I put on them (this problem was fixed with the above mentioned overnight treatment and some everstrong deep conditioner as well), if I go more than three days without washing then my hair gets so greasy I have to wash it twice...but that&#x27;s not a big deal as I&#x27;ve been pushing my hair to see how long I can go between washes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used on my hair, cheaper than shampoo and conditioner, and since I don&#x27;t wash my hair as often I don&#x27;t need to buy as much product.s problem was fixed with the above mentioned overnight treatment and some everstrong deep conditioner as well), if I go more than three days without washing then my hair gets so greasy I have to wash it twice...but that&#x27;s not a big deal as I&#x27;ve been pushing my hair to see how long I can go between washes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used on my hair, cheaper than shampoo and conditioner, and since I don&#x27;t wash my hair as often I don&#x27;t need to buy as much product.</li>
    <li> I finally used this for the first time and I&#x27;m amazed at how soft and clean it leaves my hair feeling. I was concerned I would dislike the smell because I normally don&#x27;t like strong-smelling products but it has  an almost baked-goods caramel/vanilla/light citrus smell that I have to say I love.  I have shoulder length hair, not super thick or thin, and it did take quite a few pumps of the bottle to get enough product to thoroughly rub into my hair, that was the only thing that could be improved, but overall this is a great product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Like it very much and leaves my hair soft but with body.  I thought it had a vanilla smell and didn&#x27;t hate it like some other reviewers.  Just like Wen you have to use a lot more product than you would using shampoo.  If you don&#x27;t you hair will not be clean and I suspect that was the problem of some reviewers.  I had a 32 oz bottle of Wen and with the large pump it took about 8 pumps to have enough product to clean my shoulder length hair.  The one problem with the Loreal bottle that I don&#x27;t like is that it is small and the pump is very small.  It took 32 pumps to get the same amount of product out as 8 pumps from the large Wen bottle.  I think I will buy several bottles of Loreal and put in an old Wen bottle so I can get out more product at ones.  If anyone from Loreal is reading this please make a larger size.</li>
    <li> I have fine, chemically treated, thinning hair, wavy hair with oily scalp and eczema.  My hair and scalp are basically a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this cleansing conditioner, but I can&#x27;t use it all the time.  It weighs my hair down and the scent of the product is pretty strong.  I was hoping I could use this product more often than shampoo, but haven&#x27;t been able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband sometimes uses it, but he hasn&#x27;t been able to switch over completely either because while his hair is completely opposite of mine, he also has an oily scalp and prone to dandruff.  He has found that this product sometimes causes his dandruff to be worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone because I sense this product probably works very differently on other people.  It will leave your hair very soft and not as frizzy, but be careful if you have fine hair or an oily scalp.</li>
    <li> I really feel like my hair gets clean and still stays soft, which is hard to find with 2 in 1 products.  I will say that you have to use a little bit more product because it doesn&#x27;t lather a ton.  But, the price is good enough to make it worth having to replace pretty often.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now. I was so happy it came out, as I have been tempted by WEN, but unable to purchase due to it&#x27;s price. This stuff is great! Super soft hair, nice smell, and won&#x27;t break the bank. I have long, thick, coarse hair, and go thru about a bottle a month or so. I do supplement some days with &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo as it does take a little longer to do it correctly. Well worth the time, if you have it! Some days I&#x27;m just too busy. Great product, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a test spin since I was running low on Wen.  Holy itchy. My scalp started to flake up and was completely a mess after the first couple of uses.  I don&#x27;t like the smell either.  It&#x27;s a bit overwhelming.  With Wen, I can go without cleansing my hair for a day.  With Loreal&#x27;s Evercreme, it was greasy if I skipped a cleansing day.  I also tried another hair cleanser that I didn&#x27;t like at all.  I am going to try Hair One to see if that will be any better.  At this rate, I could have bought a new bottle of Wen!</li>
    <li> I have been using cleansing conditioners for 7 years and I only feel the need to wash with shampoo about once a month.&lt;br /&gt;Having been with Wen for the first 5 years, I have tried several cleansing conditioners in the last 3 years just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything.&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of wavy frizzy hair and I am definitely not a fan of this product, it feels a lot like &amp;#34;AS I AM&amp;#34; cleansing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this because it smells great but as soon as I applied it I could tell it wasn&#x27;t the best cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not really workable in the shower because it makes my hair feel tight, if that makes any sense, and I can&#x27;t comb through it easily at all like you would with Wen, so I&#x27;ve had to use a conditioner afterwards every time. On the upside, my hair feels super clean after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The best cleansing conditioner next to &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; as far as ingredients and performance that I&#x27;ve found is &amp;#34;Hair One&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I think Herbal Essence &amp; Pantene cleansing conditioners are better in performance and better value than this product, you get twice as much product for the same price.</li>
    <li> Does not clean hair well... I guess I need suds😊</li>
    <li> I was watching an infomercial on Wen and wanted to research a cleansing conditioner that was less expensive. I have never been able to wash my hair and not add some type of product to it afterwards to keep my hair from being frizzy and to define my curls. I was extremely skeptical, but after reading the reviews on here and Ulta&#x27;s website I decided to try it. I left it in while I showered and rinsed it out while combing through my hair with my fingers. I let it air dry and was really amazed at the results. My hair is soft, has volume and my curls are defined without any styling. I called my sister the same day to tell her about it because we have the same hair texture, very curly. I highly recommend it to anyone who has been afraid (like myself) of paying a lot of money for a product they&#x27;re not sure would work.</li>
    <li> every Every EVERY shampoo I have every tried has made the psoriasis on my scalp go crazy. I&#x27;ve tried organic shampoos, dandruff shampoos, prescription shampoos, tar shampoos, salt shampoos, homemade shampoos and, yes, even the \\&quot;magical\\&quot; Wen products (which left my hair feeling like I hadn&#x27;t washed it for a month). Sure, my hair was clean, but the giant, itchy, scaly patches of psoriasis were horrifying. Keep in mind that I don&#x27;t just try products once, but use the whole bottle to really give them a good try. L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner is the only Only ONLY product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. I have been using it exclusively for almost a year, and my scalp and hair have never looked better (just a note about how it treats my hair: I have super thick, wavy, color treated, long blonde hair that frizzes easily--this cleansing conditioner really controls the frizz and makes my hair feel soft without being weighted down). If you&#x27;re scalp is sensitive or flares up after washing your hair, consider giving this a try. It is the only thing I&#x27;ll use now (and my 12 and 14  year old daughters love it too).</li>
    <li> I have fine hair - lots of it.  It is frizzy and dry on the ends, but I get oily at the scalp.  I color my hair (to cover gray) and flatiron it straight most days.  Because my hair has been so rough and frizzy, I was washing it every other day, but was still having problems with the dry/rough ends.  I had purchased this conditioner and didn&#x27;t understand how to use the product.  Using it as a conditioner; it didn&#x27;t really wow me at first.  Then I started to research it and see if I could really use it as a  non-shampoo solution.  I tried it again, but didn&#x27;t really use much and didn&#x27;t understand how to scrub my scalp and rinse it out.  So, I ended up looking like I had a really oily scalp.  Trial and error.  I tried again - this time really getting my hair wet, using a lot of the product and scrubbing at each section of my scalp.  Then I added some water and scrubbed some more.  I let it sit in my hair while I shaved my legs and finally, I gave it all a really good rinse.  Great results - smooth hair and my scalp felt clean!  I did this for about a week - no shampoo, just the cleansing conditioner.  Well, I was excited by my smoother, better hair, but my ends were still kind of dry and I was struggling to figure out how to keep my flat-ironed hair smooth and straight all day.  (I used to use silicone based sprays/creams, but these would be too hard to wash out with just a cleansing conditioner.)  To remedy  my dry ends. I started to add a deep conditioner (the one in this same product line) to the ends of my hair when I used the cleansing conditioner.  This immediately helped.  I am still looking for an all day smoothing cream (to help my hair stay straight), but the texture and color are beautiful.  My mom even commented today that my hair looked so smooth and asked what I was doing differently.  There was some trial and error, but totally worth the (very inexpensive) price and the time to test and figure out if this product will help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if Iwould ever return to regular shampoo again after 2 weeks of no shampoo.  I was in a pool all weekend and decided that maybe I should use my clarifying shampoo to wash the chemicals out of my hair.  I did and then returned to my cleansing conditioner routine right after that and it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to end with this: I have tried several products in my hair.  I work in a department store that has a salon and I love trying new things.  Nothing has consistently changed my hair and made it this smooth and soft.  I just want to touch it all of the time.  I don&#x27;t love the vanilla smell, but it&#x27;s okay.  My hair \\&quot;smells\\&quot; clean longer than it used to using any other regular shampoo.  (Odd, I know, but true.)</li>
    <li> I saw the L\\&quot;Oreal ad for this in a magazine and thought \\&quot;I can buy it in a drugstore, and if it doesn&#x27;t work - I haven&#x27;t spent much\\&quot;.  As a black woman, hair products are often not formulated to benefit my hair. I am in the process of growing out a relaxer, and my hair in it&#x27;s natural state is very kinky and dry.  I deep condition, use hot oil treatments, but all seem to provide short-term benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use of the Cleansing Conditioner - WOW!!  My hair was hydrated and springy while wet (just like in the WEN commercial).  After blow drying, it was still soft, not brittle.  That was 2 days ago...I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I have thinning, somewhat fine, wavy/frizzy, color treated hair and this products cleans without stripping anything from my hair.  Does not weight it down, looks shiny and healthy.  I can &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; it every other day with this product and wash with regular shampoo on the weekend.  Smells really nice too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to take stars away for the product itself because I love it and use it often because it&#x27;s gentle and makes my hair feel great BUT... the pump bottle design for this cleansing conditioner is a big fail! I have super thick, semi-long hair and getting enough product out of the bottle for my hair is a battle in itself! First of all the pump takes a few seconds to refill- it&#x27;s not automatic- and the amount that you get out at one time is maybe the size of a nickle. I have had to give up pumping and just take the top off and try to get the amount I need from shaking the bottle upside down. With the nature of this product- it does not lather readily like the other Evercreme shampoos because this is mostly conditioner- a SLOW pump bottle simply does not work for the amount that you need to saturate your hair adequately. If this was in a SQUEEZE bottle like the rest of the Evercreme line the item would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I like this product okay and use it in between shampoos same way I would use Wen.  Wen lathers and cleans better but dries out my hair if I use it every day.  Evercreme over conditions if I use it every day.  I have a lot of hair and Evercreme is hard to distribute without using so much that it over conditions.  If I use the amount of pumps stated on the directions it just is not enough so I add more.  I have to change up my hair products for the results I need.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and thin.  It was also rather damaged.  I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My hair is shiny and feels great.  My split ends are also gone which was unexpected since I have always had them.  I love the price and the smell is great.  Maybe it&#x27;s not for all hair types but it is worth a shot.  Worked great for me and I will keep on using this product.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely I&#x27;m love with this stuff!! It was recommended by a co-worker who&#x27;s been using it for months. I love that I don&#x27;t have to use a leave in conditioner or any other products to achieve soft, frizz free hair. I hope this doesn&#x27;t get discontinued, right now it&#x27;s hard to find for me, only at CVS. Anyways, if your thinking about buying this please do, you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived ahead of expected date.</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to like this!  Bought it at Target after reading these reviews. I wanted it as a substitute for Wen. I mixed a little of this shampoo with double that amount of conditioner and washed my hair as an even gentler shampoo. Before it even finished washing out I could feel my hair feeling more and more like straw. It was gross to touch. I immediately put in a ton of intense conditioner and let it sit for a while. This helped, but it still felt so bad I was very worried to blow it dry thinking it would fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry hair but have always used the cheap Suave or V05. I use a little Moroccan oil and I&#x27;m all good. I thought I&#x27;d &#x27;up&#x27; my game by researching and buying the best bang for my buck product. This seemed like a good first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so bad I literally took the bottle back to Target and got my money back. Worst thing ever!</li>
    <li> I saw the commercials for Wren and thought I just had to have that but the prices are ridiculous. After reading reviews, this looked like the next best thing. I am not a fan at all. Hated first day hair but does pretty well for 2nd and 3rd day hair. Just felt weighted down and call me only school, but I like to lather my hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair type 3C, this cleaning conditioner had been more effective to me than the conditioner, it is easier to detangle my knots</li>
    <li> I have to freely admit that I didn&#x27;t read the label carefully enough, and thought that this was just normal ol&#x27; conditioner.  (I thought it was odd that it lathered up a bit...)  As a conditioner, I like it well enough.  As a shampoo... not as much.  Using it to wash my hair instead of a shampoo seems to leave my hair feeling greasy at the end of the day.  Using this as a conditioner after I&#x27;ve thoroughly washed it with a regular shampoo seems fine.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it for 4 months and it is wonderful, let my hair super soft and cozy.</li>
    <li> This smells like that one brown sugar line at the popular fragrance chain store.  First non-shampoo cleanser I used after quitting regular shampoo altogether.  I still have some bottles of it and will use them up.  Effective cleanser.</li>
    <li> My hair used to get oily a day after washing. Not anymore. This stuff is great, I seriously will not use anything else. It smells so nice, and its a one step deal. It doesnt strip the good oils from your haor just the dirt and grease. After using it for 7 months now I only have to wash my hair 2 times a week. And my hair looks great everyday. My hair feels great as well. I have bleached my hair more times than I can count, and I cut my haor once a year,  and my hair is super healthy. I barely have any split ends. This stuff is the end all be all.</li>
    <li> This is the most awful product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair and after two uses, it&#x27;s going right in to the garbage. It makes my hair feel heavy, stringy, greasy, and full of residue. It actually feels dirtier after &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; with this than it did before. Yet somehow, my soft face-framing curls are frizzy dry puffs. I only wash my hair 1-3 times per week depending and have tried many products including Devacurl, Hugo Naturals, Giovanni, making my own no poo, as well as more mainline shampoos ranging from Suave to Biolage. I&#x27;ve never, ever thrown a bottle of shampoo away before but I can&#x27;t imagine using this stuff one more time. I&#x27;d be better off just rinsing my hair in water. Not to mention it smells gross. I can&#x27;t say enough how not picky I am about my hair and beauty products in general. This is absolutely hands down the worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> This is just a personal preference, but the smell of this stuff just killed me. I know a lot of reviewers love the smell, and rave about it, BUT if you have a SENSITIVE NOSE like mine, this stuff will fill your nightmares. The scent is just toooooo strong. I can&#x27;t even give an opinion on how it works because I couldn&#x27;t last!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, and hated the smell as soon as sniffed it and tried it in the shower, but, after all, most hair scents usually fade by the time your hair is dry, so I was still willing to give it a try. This scent is so powerful and awful I had a migraine before I had even fully dried my hair, and it lingered so strongly on my dry hair that I gave up and washed it out an hour after the first shower. THE SMELL STILL LINGERED even after I washed my hair again! I had to shower AGAIN once I got back from my appointments, and let me tell you, even if this stuff was perfection for my hair and babysat my kids and paid me money I would still never ever use it again. So, just a heads up, if you like strong enduring scents right next to your face, this might be worth a try, but if you&#x27;re the least bit sensitive to smells, please please please, by all that is holy, skip this and spare yourself the anguish!</li>
    <li> So I am still on my search for a cheaper version of Wen.  This has so many ingredients and the over powering smell is a bit much.  It works but for more thin hair with oily scalp.  My hair is more dry and needs a bit more moisture.  I gave this to a friend with thin, oily hair and she loved it.  Just not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been reading rave reviews about this product and decided to give it a try. My hair is fine, wavy and prone to frizz. I knew Evercreme wouldn&#x27;t lather like a regular shampoo, but I kept pumping it out and it was very time consuming. My hair is only a little bit past my shoulders. I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner as it said it wasn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I towel-blotted my hair and tried to comb through it. Strands were actually falling out from the back and my hair felt rough. I blow-dried on a low setting but my hair didn&#x27;t feel healthy. It felt dry, coated and some color was actually stripped away from the crown of my head. The scent didn&#x27;t really bother me, but the condition of my hair is bad now. From just one use, the back of my hair is very knotted and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;What a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Wen and used it exclusively for a couple years, but quit due to the cost. I&#x27;ve been searching ever since for a less expensive substitute! Anyway, I was excited to try Evercreme, really liked it, and used two bottles straight. Suddenly, in the middle of my third bottle, I realized my hair was totally dull and flat, like it was covered in residue. I guess it was probably a gradual change, but I was definitely not pleased. Also, I agree with other reviews that the scent is very, very strong. It&#x27;s a warm smell, like vanilla-y and maybe coconut-ish, and smells ok at first, but quickly started to annoy me. Anyway, I think you&#x27;d probably just have to break up using this with a clarifying shampoo once a week or so to keep the residue away. That sort of defeats the purpose though, for me, but others might be ok with it.</li>
    <li> I have bought expensive shampoos and conditioners - and cheap ones as well - for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that this is the best hair product that I have used on her hair and is very price friendly.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it on my hair as well even though there is a bouquet smell that lingers but that is a minor inconvenience being a mere male!&lt;br /&gt;This product gives our hair bulk, a lovely sheen and and makes it more manageable without the need for other products.&lt;br /&gt;I was actually looking at Wen reviews before making a purchase but after reading so many good comparable reports about L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme I decided to forget the Wen and try the L&#x27;Oreal. These were general reviews on the internet - not the Amazon product reviews.&lt;br /&gt;We will never use another hair product in our house while this is available. It is not available in New Zealand so I will continue to purchase from Amazon and get it shipped to me.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone from L&#x27;Oreal reads this ... PLEASE make it available to your NZ representatives!&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that two lady friends have sampled this and rave about it. They will be ordering some for themselves as well.</li>
    <li> the product actually works pretty good, it feels good in my hair,&lt;br /&gt;and seems to clean and condition without leaving my hair frizzy&lt;br /&gt;like the traditional shampoo...  but I really do not like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying it again just because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;it smells like really cheap men&#x27;s cologne... and since I&#x27;m female,&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s just a no.  but hey, it might be just what a gay guy is looking for!</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian and have fine, shoulder length hair that is prone to breakage and can get frizzy.  I like Wen so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  It doesn&#x27;t feel very conditioning as you are using it like Wen does and it left my hair frizzy and dry.  I didn&#x27;t like it.  I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a cheaper version of Wen.</li>
    <li> I am a white male approaching 60 with fine, wavy hair past my shoulders.  My goal is to keep life as simple as possible -- I didn&#x27;t even use conditioner until I was past 35 -- so I am coming at this product from a very different perspective than most reviews I&#x27;ve read.  I am the kind of guy who has been tempted by shampoo/conditioner combinations, but have decided they neither clean nor condition.  This is a one-stop solution that works. My hair feels and behaves all day like it used to feel and behave only for a brief sweet spot between the excessive fluffiness after showering and the inevitable greasy feeling late in the day.  If, by any chance, I start to feel I need a deeper clean from time to time, like after yardwork, I just use another shampoo and conditioner once, then go back.</li>
    <li> About 9 months ago I was sorely tempted by the WEN ads and reviews. I was using Ojion &amp; just didn&#x27;t think my hair was getting as well conditioned as I had experienced in the past with their products. My fine blond highlighted, below shoulder hair was feeling really dull, and I had to use shine serum to make it look nice. I don&#x27;t remember how I discovered L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, but I&#x27;ve always liked Loreal products &amp; figured a $6 experiment was much cheaper than the Wen&#x27;s deal. I&#x27;ve been hooked since. My hair is now thicker, has body--something I don&#x27;t ever remember my hair having--and just feels sooo good! It actually feels healthy! Yay! I only shampoo once every 2-3 days, and oily hair only becomes a problem on day 3. Like a lot of reviewers, I HATE the pump mechanism. I know Wen &amp; others do this, but it&#x27;s such a silly dispensing method--especially since you have to use so much product to get your hair clean. An upside down tube makes so much more sense--especially in the shower. It took a bit of time to learn the routine. I really soak my hair pre-shampoo, then I take about 15-20 pumps to apply throughout my hair and work it in to my scalp until I get a good light lathery feeling. I pile my hair on top of my head, soap, shave legs &amp; whatever else I need to do in my shower. Last step is the rinse. Thank goodness I have a handheld shower wand. I rinse my hair like they do at the salons--to get everything out &amp; get really clean hair. I often take a hair pick to run it through to make it easier for the product to come out. Then volia! Lovely clean, super conditioned hair--that smells incredible. My husband hates some hair products, but he likes this one. Great job L&#x27;Oreal! I hope you run an education on how to use this incredible product. Like others, I love this so much &amp; don&#x27;t want it to disappear because people don&#x27;t understand how to use it. And get rid of the pump!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had softer, silkier hair and I love it! You do have to use a ton more than you think. I thought my hair was getting a weird build-up after using it for 2 months, so the next time I showered, I used 3 times as much and came out with my dream hair. Getting used to doing a much more thorough rinse was also a learning curve for me. I can take or leave the smell though. It&#x27;s kinda weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use way more than you think you need and rinse thoroughly.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair so hard it feels like straw. I&#x27;ve used shampoos that make my hair feel 12 times softer. It does lather, though slightly. I&#x27;ve gotten so used to using top quality shampoos and conditioners so it takes a lot for a product to impress me. It smells amazing, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Love the product and so glad that I can get it shipped into New Zealand again, since it is not available here.  I tell others about the product, but they can&#x27;t imagine it, since all that is available is shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I find that shampoo strips my hair no matter which product it use, where this product cleans my scalp and hair with only conditioning!  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I read that it would help with fly away hair, caused by humidity. It doesn&#x27;t work as good as expected. I do like to use it, every couple of days. If I use it too often my hair gets really greasy.</li>
    <li> I tried this last night. I had been using Redken Extreme, but it made my hair stiff, unruly and dry! I was considering buying Wen, but there was no way I was spending that much on shampoo (or cleansing conditioner, whatever). I picked this up as a highly rated alternative. After using it, even when my hair was still wet I noticed increased shine. Upon drying, it looked and smelled amazing. It definitely improved my hair, but I think a few more uses would probably help as my hair was in a horrible state to start, and you can&#x27;t expect it to be completely better after one use. As it is, I&#x27;m hooked and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use expensive shampoo conditioners again!</li>
    <li> not even close to WEN.  It smells good, but it suds.  It leave my hair kind of dry.  My hair is naturally curly/wavy.  When I use WEN, I can just get out of the shower, shake my hair out upside-down and go.  With this I would definitely have to use moisturizer and gel to get that glossy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay at that price, but it really isn&#x27;t the best.  I&#x27;d go for hair-one or As I am.  Those products are similar to WEN, but they don&#x27;t feel as clean.  I recently bought all three products, Evercreme, hair-one and As I Am.  I would Evercreme once a week to strip my scalp and then use hair-one or As I am for the rest of the week.  I still prefer WEN over all the other products.</li>
    <li> So Perfect Better than W ans so inexpensive love love</li>
    <li> Smells terrible! Hair super greasy</li>
    <li> Another one-shot hair product that requires a LOT of cleanser to clean hair, and you will have limp, scraggly hair, regardless of how much you rinse it. That said, I use it so I don&#x27;t have to carry a ton of product into the gym locker room, and follow the direction and review recommendations carefully (really wet your hair, use a ton of product, and let it work for quite a while) and it&#x27;s okay for a few days. Then you&#x27;re really going to want to shampoo your hair, &#x27;cause it neither looks nor feels really clean. That said, I will use it, because the convenience at the gym is worth the slightly bedraggled look.</li>
    <li> These products transform my dry dull hair into a very soft silky feeling. I use the entire line and sent my friend the products also.</li>
    <li> This product is every bit as good as that terribly expensive one advertised on TV.  I love this stuff!  Will continue to buy it and the companion spray-on product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My hair is thick and natural, and tangles when wet. This makes my hair very soft, manageable and easy to comb through. it smells good. My hair feels so moist after use. I have never used a product that has made my hair feeI so good. I only wish they had a larger bottle because, again, my hair is thick and I use a lot of it. I have to buy 2 bottles at once. I swear by this product and love that I don&#x27;t have to do the extra step of conditioning separately.</li>
    <li> For the reference I have long hair (down to my hips), straight, oily on the roots, frizzy at the ends and I color them blond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is quite damaged I wanted to adapt the whole &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; hair washing but the idea of not using any type of cleansing solution was bit repulsive to me.&lt;br /&gt;I heard that the deva curl product are great for no poo hair washing , but those are ridiculously pricy. I saw this one comparable to deva curl  and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;This is what I think:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;- I like the fragrance of it. Very coconut-almondy like.&lt;br /&gt;- It helped with the frizziness in my hair a lot. It&#x27;s not completely gone but it&#x27;s so much better.&lt;br /&gt;-My hair is really soft after using this.&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t have to use detangling spray anymore. My hair is not as nearly as tangled as if I use shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- In order to get this product all over my hair I have to use a lot. Probably more then I would use of shampoo. So I went trough this bottle very fast.&lt;br /&gt;- I have to wash hair every day now. I used to washed my hair every other day but now my hair gets oily lot faster. But I heard that that can happen when you stop using shampoo and should get better with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you thinking about trying this product I would recommend to just give it a chance. I know that there is many bad reviews but like with any other shampoo or conditioner it will always works differently on different person. Every one of us have different hair and skin and we live if different environment and that all can effect the results you get.&lt;br /&gt;It is also at the price like any regular shampoo or conditioner from drugstore so if you end up not liking it&#x27;s not like you would waste a fortune on it.</li>
    <li> It was okay. I do not have dry hair. I actually have decently soft, healthy hair, but I was weary about sulfates, and this seemed like a great idea. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I was not impressed. I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference between this product and your run-of-the-mill 2-in-1. I put it in there, let it soak while I finished showering, and then rinsed it out completely. Already, I knew it wasn&#x27;t working out, because it felt worse than if I had just used shampoo. My fingers were not going through my hair as easily as they normally would after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got out of the shower, I towel dried it, put in some leave-in conditioner, and lightly blow-dried my hair. My hair was frizzier than usual and very dry. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but this actually dried my hair out. I will continue to use it, but I will have to use a conditioner with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a different note, it did clean my normally slightly oily hair very well, and it had a really nice, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was just okay.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, that is color-treated. I have tried so many shampoos/conditioners to help tame my frizz while retaining the natural curl without weighing it down. This does the job for me. My routine is to get plenty of the product in my hand THEN wet my hair. Massage into my scalp then run through to the ends. Leave it soaking until I finish the rest of my bathing ritual, then rinse thoroughly. If I recall, the premise to this product is something like 1 part shampoo/cleanser, 3 parts conditioner. That being said, your hair won&#x27;t \\&quot;squeak\\&quot; after rinsing, so you can either under or over-rinse. I make sure to rub my scalp whilst rinsing, which is a good method for me. If the water is pretty clear coming from the ends, it&#x27;s rinsed. Whatever works for you. I love the way it makes my hair feel, look...and oh my it smells SO good. Get lots of compliments...</li>
    <li> I have very light blonde hair that gets tangled all the time, its long and i hate brushing it all the time to keep it from tangling, so i got this product to give it ago, as in the past i have used all sorts of other stuff , that just didnt seem to work for my hair at all and have tryed all different oils as well, so i thought that i would give this ago, and to my luck, it works very well, i was very surpised that it worked at all, it smells great and leaves my hair very soft and not so many fly aways anymore, i still use my frizz ease after i wash in it, and my hair is so much better, thank you L&#x27;Oreal..</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take long to put in and rinse, also has a very nice fragrance. Fiancée enjoys it.</li>
    <li> Great co-wash cleanser.  The manufacturer says this is 1/4 cleanser and 3/4 condition, which is about right.  I like this cleanser better than some others because there is a tiny bit of lather, and I don&#x27;t have to use as much.  Some say they don&#x27;t like the smell.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smells, and I think this is a delightful scent.</li>
    <li> Does not work, smells bad.</li>
    <li> It cleaned my hair and made it soft, but I would always feel I needed to wash my hair again the next day, which I do not want to have to do.</li>
    <li> This is the worst smelling cleansing conditioner! I can&#x27;t say how well it actually worked due to the horrible smell and quickly rinsing it out and using shampoo to rid that odor! Just awful! Way too perfume and chemical smelling.  L&#x27;Oreal do something about this, and I will consider purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does leave my hair curlier and less frizzy than my normal shampoo/conditioner.  But it is WAY too perfumed.  My hair smells strongly even 24 hours after washing.  It makes my eyes water and my husband sneezes when I walk in the room.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to use a cleansing conditioner for a long time yet I didn&#x27;t want to invest all that money on WEN products.  I tried the knock off of WEN from Sally&#x27;s and it was mehhh so I was super excited to see this in Wal-Mart!  It works wonders to make your hair silky, shiny and very soft.  A few caveats though:  if you have super fine hair like me, make sure you rinse, rinse, and more rinse or your hair can look quite oily by the end of the day.  Also, a small con is that you have to pump for days to get out enough product-remove the pump and dump it in your hand and work it through your hair in small sections, crown, sides, back and then the length of your hair like the WEN infomercial advises.  Another tip is to not be afraid to use a good deal and really lather up your scalp well.  It seems counter intuitive I know, but you can get some lather action and if you don&#x27;t or don&#x27;t rinse well enough your hair will not look clean especially by the end of the day.  Otherwise you will be a happy camper!  If you&#x27;re trying to grow your hair or it is dry and damaged use this and minimal heat and it will look great in no time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m comparing this to Lisa Rachel products for cleaning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this product is nice but gets a little overwhelming for me.  It lasts for a full day and I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, so that is why the three star review instead of 4 and why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to a friend who has curly hair or who is sensitive to fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the next issue, I need to predicate what I&#x27;m saying by explaining what my hair type is as hair types can influence reviews.  My hair is very curly (type 3A whirly curly) and has all the problems of curly hair such as it&#x27;s very dry and it tangles really easy.  If I use a regular shampoo, the ends of my hair look totally frizzed.  I have to use heavy conditioners that will weight it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this L&#x27;Oreal because it was less than WEN or Lisa Rachel.  With this product, my hair does not have the same results as it does with Lisa Rachel.  With the Lisa Rachel product, my hair feels much softer and more manageable, and I can go 5 days without washing (the less I wash my hair, the better my hair is).  This is also why I gave it a 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to give this a higher rating, and for some people, the L&#x27;Oreal product might work, just not for me with my hair type.</li>
    <li> This product left me with very mixed feelings. On one hand, it does exactly what it claims to do (leaves hair soft and clean in one step); but on the other hand, the amount of effort required to achieve that result makes it almost not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair and trying to pump out enough product for all of my hair is a work out in itself. The pump is itty-bitty! The cream doesn&#x27;t distribute through hair particularly easily either, so you end up having to use more than you&#x27;ve already pumped out to make sure you don&#x27;t neglect any patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shorter hair this is probably a holy grail shower product (Everything in one small bottle! It doubles as great shaving cream, too). Next time around I may just buy several bottles at once and find a different container with a better dispensing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This also smells identical to Bath and Body Work&#x27;s Shea Cashmere hand cream. It&#x27;s a pretty polarizing and strong scent, so definitely heed everyone&#x27;s warnings if you&#x27;re vanilla-adverse.)</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  I have thick shoulder length colored and highlighted hair, and just 5 pumps work for me.  Leaves my hair clean, shiny, smooth, and manageable.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like \\&quot;sudsing\\&quot; shampoos do.  I have been using this product for 3 weeks now, and I will never go back to the old sudsing shampoos.  Why do you think you need a conditioner after shampooing?? Because your hair is stripped of the essential oils, this product DOES NOT strip your hair, and your haircolor/highlighting will look as good in a month as the day you did it.  Its a great scalp conditioner too.  Never itchy, never flaky.  I think you will like this product (give it a try and remember it will not foam up).  Pump into your hand and massage into the scalp taking it to the ends, then take a wide tooth comb and comb through, leave in for about 2-3 minutes and rinse, thats it, your hair and scalp will love you for it. Also the smell is wonderful, exotic oriental notes, not fruity or flowery.</li>
    <li> After use my hair is clean, but I was surprised that my scalp itches. The fragrance is great. Rinses clean.</li>
    <li> I have oily and fine hair and had a hard time finding a cleansing conditioner that didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.  This works great and actually leaves my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
    <li> It made my hair way too greasy. I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Smells nice. I still need to use a separate conditioner, my hair is pretty dry. Someone with normal hair could get away with using this alone. It actually lathers quite a bit if you use lots of water.</li>
    <li> Bought this product after seeing one million WEN commercials and getting my curiosity piqued.  I am always looking for something to make my kids (especially my girls) hair manageable and that does not hurt to get rinsed out.  This stuff works like magic.  Smells great, kids don&#x27;t mind using it, and DOES NOT HURT when rinsed, even with my baby&#x27;s wide open eyes. Afterwards, combing hair is a breeze.  The hair is shiny, manageable, and clean.  I&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo again!</li>
    <li> I have given this product more than enough of a chance (2 months).  I read quite a few of the prior reviews before I used it.  I have thinnish,straight above the shoulder hair. My 2 problems with the product (in addition to the scent)are: 1. I could not figure out how many pumps to use.  10 was too many.  I tried 8-9 that wasn&#x27;t good.  I tried fewer. I tried more.  I used some of the other reviews as guidelines.  No good.  2. I have RINSED AND RINSED and can&#x27;t get the stuff out of my hair.  If I give it up for several shampoos is seems to be OK for ONE wash.  Then I get buildup like you wouldn&#x27;t believe even though it feels like I&#x27;m under the spray for 5 minutes trying to get this stuff out.  Come on, L&#x27;oreal.  Go back to the drawing board on this product.  I like the combo idea because it saves time.  But this really needs some reevaluation.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, 8.3 Fluid Ounce is a wonderful product and saves money in the long run. It elemenates having 2 bottles in the shower...one shampoo and one conditioner. This is different from the usual all in one shampoo/conditioner. It actually makes the hair more manageable and nothing else is needed. It is a good product and similar to the Winn products which costs much more. I get my hair very wet and apply the product and then wash my face and rest of me and this gives my hair at least 3 minutes to absorbed the conditioning benefits of this product. It makes my hair easier to style and healthier looking. I am happy with this hair product.</li>
    <li> As a person who has primarily used Wen. This was great. Very soft lots of volume. But this does later every so slightly like a shampoo. But it was very gentle. I have been having dandruff issues from using the wen for 6 years. So I have began using Nioxin system 2 cleanser and conditioner a few times per week and styling with the wen products. Then  in between using this loreal. I have tried the Vidal Sasoon cleansing conditioner and this loreal is far superior to it.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as WEN, a few times I thought I liked it better but I think it&#x27;s more cleansing than WEN, not quite as Conditioning.</li>
    <li> Got about 5 bottles of this because I was using Wen for awhile and I simply cannot afford it. L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s version seems a little more drying but it&#x27;s just about the same. I&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner after using cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product! And I was able to get it on here for cheaper then what they sell it in the supermarket for!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I wanted to reduce the number of days that I used a regular shampoo, and using conditioner alone didn&#x27;t get my hair clean enough. Based on the reviews here, it seems that people have either a really good experience or a bad one, and wow ... was my experience bad.  I used the product as directed, and ended up with a hair that felt like I&#x27;d just stepped out of a highly chlorinated pool. It was tangled, dull, extremely dry, brittle. It also seemed to cause me to shed more hair than usual, though I&#x27;m not sure about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was yesterday. Today my hair is closer to what it used to be like, and in case this happens to any of you, here&#x27;s what I did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* immediately sprayed my hair with an argan-based leave-in conditioner, to get some moisture back in immediately. I used quite a bit, and put in a little pure argan as well, very carefully massaging it to avoid further breakage. It looked rather oily and dull still, but the consistency was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* washed my hair the next day with a clarifying shampool, just a little, and followed with a frizz-taming conditioner, letting the conditioner sit for a minute or two before rinsing. That felt better but still not good ... so ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* ... I used very large quantities of my favoriate argan-based hair mask (see my other reviews), and left that on for a full five minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair now feels almost normal. Of course the breakage can only be fixed by letting it grow. Some of my hair still feels pretty strawlike and I&#x27;ll update next weekend if continued TLC helps with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is interesting in that not my entire headful of hair reacted the same. The ends and shorter pieces fared the worst, and the emerging gray streaks are dryer (and more obvious now). The back, which is somewhat thicker to begin with, and which does not have much gray in it, actually looks pretty nice and feels normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, at my last haircut in December thehairdresser said that my just past shoulder length hair was in excellent condition, strong and in good shape, and that I did not need to add any products (although she offered to color the gray that&#x27;s emerging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a lesson learned, if I were to do this again, I&#x27;d only wash a small portion of my hair with this product; it seems typical for these cleansing conditions to have widely different effects.</li>
    <li> Fights frizz,  leaves hair soft and shiny. It&#x27;s very thick: I&#x27;d suggest skipping the pump and pouring it into your hand.  I&#x27;ve tried WEN, this is similar,  and I like it better because I don&#x27;t like the smell of peppermint.  Some people have complained about the scent.  I also don&#x27;t like strong scents.  The smell dissapates as your hair dries and if you add mousse and/or other styling products you can&#x27;t smell it.  Get your hair very wet first,  leave it on a few minutes and make sure you rinse well and be prepared for gorgeous hair with tons of body!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good price on WEN, which I have been using for over a year and works so well on my hair. My hair is thick and wavy and I wear it straight but it is so hard to get it to look soft and manageable with regular shampoo and conditioner. So, I am hooked on cleansing conditioner. Problem is...I&#x27;m a single mom and WEN is expensive. When I saw this product and read the other reviews I had to try it. It&#x27;s just wonderful and works just as well as Wen and SO much cheaper. I would recommend it to an</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used WEN in the past as well as Hair ONE and both products (to me) were unimpressive. I guess it&#x27;s my hair type but I have very VERY greasy hair. WEN did clean it but the &#x27;soft, healthy&#x27; hair everyone had been talking about did not happen to me, and I had to use it everyday to fight the grease build up of my hair. I felt like it was definitely not worth the high price. Same with hair one, I did like it better than WEN but I wasn&#x27;t so impressed that I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw L&#x27;Oréal came out with this and I thought for the price I may as well try and I am SO happy I did! My hair is SO soft and grows so quickly now, but the best part is I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday day! I can alternate between this and the matching conditioner in the shower, and for me using a cleanser every other day is a big BIG deal! Not even a little bit of grease on the second day :)! I was shocked in the best way. And the price! I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and I always get the same results. I love when people ask what shampoo I use and I get to tell them &#x27;I haven&#x27;t shampooed in... Months&#x27; lol!</li>
    <li> I gave Loreal Evercreme 5 stars because it smells great, and really does clean your hair considering it&#x27;s a cleansing conditioner. I bought it instead of WEN because it had gotten really good reviews, and was considerably cheaper. I like it better than WEN! My hair feels soft every time I use it, and it has more bounce. I have fine hair so it really helps. I would recommend this product to anyone considering WEN.</li>
    <li> I have long straight oily hair so I may not be the best candidate for a cleansing conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks and I like it a lot!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not great in the shower but smells good in your hair after!</li>
    <li> I have a love hate relationship with this stuff. I use it exactly the same way, but some days it weighs my hair down, some days it works really well. The smell is a nice (though heavy) clean smell. Kind of coconut-vanilla I think. So, ymmv, I wouldn&#x27;t say don&#x27;t try it, but the days it doesn&#x27;t work well...yikes you&#x27;re hair looks greasy.</li>
    <li> I found a conditioning cleanser that is easier on the pocketbook than Wen.  Hair is clean, shiny, manageable and has a lot of body.</li>
    <li> I still need to shampoo every once in a while. There can be some build up, but my hair is in better condition after using for a month.  My curly haired girlfriend asked what I use, and tried it.  She agrees with the occasional shampoo to cut down the build up, but otherwise likes this product.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to tame my unruly hair for 50 years and have finally found a product that leaves my hair soft and wavy.  I have shoulder length hair and use 8 pumps to cleanse my hair.  I use 3 times a week after my hair gets sweaty from running.  I leave in for 2 minutes and rinse with cool water to seal my hair.  I am not using any products on my hair that contain sulfates and this is working like magic.  I actually like my hair and don&#x27;t feel a need to try and straighten it daily.  For the first time I can let my hair air dry and it looks good after a fluff out.  I have been using this for over a month and still have over half a bottle left.  It goes a long way.  I hope they never discontinue this product.  I also use and recommend the Everceme Nourishing Leave-In Spray.</li>
