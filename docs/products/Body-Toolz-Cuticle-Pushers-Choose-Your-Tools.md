<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one handy little tool.  I use it on my family members and myself, it really helps with at home mani/pedi.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this cuticle pusher.  I particularly like the smaller, squarer end that gets into the corners of my square nails.</li>
    <li> Just like they have at the nail salon,very satisfied,I no longer have to go to the nail salon. I spent a little money to save a lot .</li>
    <li> my cuticles grow on top of my nails real bad. Went and had a manicure and she told me to push my cuticles back with my fingers after a shower. But seem to hurt. So I got this tool to help me. It is very good at what it does, maybe to good. I slipped and cut my finger a little. Then I went in to much at a angle and cute my nail. So be careful as it can cut. Now with a little practice I am good at it. After I soak my cuticles I push them back with this tool.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t too much to say about cuticle pushers other than do they push cuticles?  Yes, this one does.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, one end is curved and smooth for pushing and the other end (the angled one) has an edge for scraping, but is also curved for just the right fit.  Money well-spent.</li>
    <li> I love this cuticle pusher. It is easy to clean, sturdy and works just like a professional cuticle pusher. This is definitely a secret weapon for any one doing DIY manicures.</li>
    <li> I really never like to be pushy but with this product you can&#x27;t help yourself.  While it is true that this is the only cuticle pusher we own, it is also the best one.  I give it a thumbs up and four cuticled finger approval.</li>
    <li> This is a great professional quality tool.  with one swipe of the shovel shaped edge, you can easily push cuticles back in one swipe.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my cuticles before polishing with gel/shellac polish. It turns out, it&#x27;s awesome for scraping off that polish after soaking. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> Best cuticle pusher I&#x27;ve used.  I haven&#x27;t used the cutter end, but the pusher side works well to scrap dead skin and push the cuticle back.  Has good weight to it and seems like a sturdy product.</li>
    <li> Looked for this for years - Found it here. Works great.</li>
    <li> This tool keeps my cuticles in check and with its sturdy design, you can&#x27;t help but think it is going to last for a long time. I am not sure of how to keep it sharp, but other than that it works very well (and this is coming from a nail-biter)!.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself because I do my own manicures and pedicures at home with shellac products.  I gave it three stars, but it does get the job done.  It&#x27;s a little large for use on fingers-I think it was made for toes.  But, I&#x27;ll keep and and make it work.  It does a nice job of removing the shellac and pushing cuticles.</li>
    <li> Got this to remove Shellac nail polish myself at home. Perfect little product! Soak a cotton pad in some acetone, wrap nails in foil and let soak for at least 10 minutes. Unwrap nails and use the Body Toolz Cuticle Pusher to gently push off any remaining Shellac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping too!</li>
    <li> I love this nail tool! I bought it for my home shellac manicures but I use it every time I do my nails. My cuticles grow outrageously and this has helped keep them in control.</li>
    <li> This Cuticle pusher works so smoothly. I&#x27;ve always used a little squarish metal one and always end up pushing too hard. This is really easy to use and is fast. glad I added this to my nail arsenal.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy any more of this unless I lose this.&lt;br /&gt;Best quality tool I have ever bought on line.</li>
    <li> Like others, I do my own gel manicures at home.  I&#x27;ve never been good about pushing my cuticles back, etc, but with gel you MUST or it starts to lift right away.  So I got this to help me have nice looking manicures.  It works quite well.  I use it in conjunction with cuticle remover, and it does a pretty good job. I do think it was designed for toenails, but it works for fingernails just as well.</li>
    <li> Works well but I may have gone a little overboard on the cuticle pusher since I have stubborn, very hard cuticles. I got too aggressive with pushing down the cuticle that I caused damage and dents to my nail bed that took a while to grow out. Push gently! Other than that, I first used the flatter end for both my fingers and toes, but now I&#x27;ve moved from using the curvier end for my fingers and the flatter end for my toes. I find that that works better and keeps me from damaging my fingernails as much.</li>
    <li> this cuticle pusher is great. It does the trick for cleaning the nail plate nicely before I apply artificial nails. I would recommend this product. And the price point was great too.</li>
    <li> Not much else to say about this product except it arrived quickly, as stated and does the job! It was also reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I love to give myself manicures and pedicures, and so glad I bought this. I used to use the orange wood sticks earlier, but they were not as effective to push back the cuticles (they only remove the dead cuticle cells).   Yesterday I used this cuticle pusher for the first time, and now my cuticles are in great shape. I&#x27;m loving my nails all the more.</li>
    <li> This tool is the perfect cuticle tool.  The shape fits nicely around the nail; the sharp edge really removes tough cuticles without much effort or damage to the nail; the grip is comfortable in the hand.  I will never live without this now.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cuticle tool. The oddly shaped smaller end turns out to be perfect for shaping fingernail cuticles. I use the larger end for toenails but it can be used for fingernails too. The tool is sturdy and can be cleaned in alcohol. I definitely appreciate this tool for DIY manicures.</li>
    <li> Thank you Body Toolz for making the perfect cuticle tool.  I never knew I needed a cuticle tool like this or that it existed.  But while I was searching for a cuticle snipper, I happened across this.  I used it this morning in the shower on my toes and what a difference!  It was quick and easy.  Before, I used my nails to scrap off the cuticles and dead skin on my feet which I did not like doing at all but was resigned to it.  The bell shaped end is what I like the best.  It is not sharp enough to cut, but shaped to scrap the nail bed cleanly with gentle pressure (like a dinner knife except contoured).  The corner also scrapes off the dead skin just below the nails, on the cuticles, and on the sides of each nail.  The downward angle of the bell also was very ergonomical.  Such a great tool!  It was a little slippery to use with soap on your hands and body so be sure to rinse off first to get a good grip and perfect pedicure in the shower or out.  Needless to say, you have to soak first to soften the cuticles and skin.  I will also use this for my manicure (not too big for finger nails).  GREAT TOOL!!!  I love it.</li>
    <li> This tool is wonderful!  I like the opposite end from the pusher for removing &amp; touching up when applying polish!</li>
    <li> I have trouble with my cuticles often and this little device is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.  It neatly and successfully pushes the cuticle back ... even the thin cuticle that likes to stay stuck on your nail. Great device!</li>
    <li> Great little tool. I use it to push back my cuticles, clean my nails, and to clean (scrape)nail polish off my cuticles when painting my nails.</li>
    <li> Thanks item as described</li>
    <li> This cuticle pusher was sturdy, but it wasn&#x27;t sharp enough. The edges on both end seemed a little blunt, so when I tried pushing it actually hurt.</li>
    <li> This product is for gigantic hands/feet; the cuticle pusher is okay, barely, and the cutter is so big its impossible to use on fingers/toes</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work well for me. It just was too dull to effectively move my cuticles back. It&#x27;s a well made product though, if only it were sharper.</li>
    <li> This cuticle pusher works really well and is very sharp.  I haven&#x27;t used a cuticle pusher before, so it took some practice to become good at it.  Make sure you soak your hands in water to make your life easier.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality, solid instrument for &amp;#60; $10.  Works well for intended purpose.  It is a single piece, no removable or articulating parts.  It should last indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I found this tool to be very effective. It was delivered very quick. It is a cost-effective purchase. I would recommend this cuticle pusher.</li>
    <li> I have smaller fingers and this cuticle pusher was great.  It fits right up against my cuticle and it only takes one push to do the job.  Other cuticle pushers can have a much smaller head which means more &amp;#34;pushes&amp;#34; to do the whole cuticle.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly what I needed. Works great and very affordable. Just don&#x27;t push too hard on your nails, it will strip the top layer, but that&#x27;s pretty normal for metal pushers.</li>
    <li> I actually did not receive this product. Whoever packaged my order must have not paid attention. I got some weird pimple popping tool, and I don&#x27;t even get them. I&#x27;m so glad I only order one item from this provider.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and shape for removing soak off gel nail polish. Would definitely purchase again in the future if needed.</li>
    <li> I love this tool. It has a short side that is has an arc to it , it fits your nail bed well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> not rusting, still using them, have not sharpen it or anything. have this for a couple of years, i do my own nails.</li>
    <li> I find this cuticle pusher much easier to use, and more effective than the usual type.</li>
    <li> This makes doing my own mani/pedi a lot faster! Really great tool to use on your finger and toe nails. The grip on each end makes it really comfortable to use and control. The ends are angles just right! Really love this product!</li>
    <li> I was having a professional pedicure when I noticed my esthetician using one of these. This tool works great for pushing back toenail cuticles and grooming toenails. I now own two of them -- one stays near the tub, the other stays with my nail polish. I also use it (gently) on my fingernail cuticles.</li>
    <li> larger than expected, but very solid, strong, well made product.</li>
    <li> Very useful tool,be careful not to cut into your nail.&lt;br /&gt;I use the large end often, small is tighter radius edge.</li>
    <li> This cuticle pusher works quite well. I expected it to be a little better because of all the 5 star reviews. I feel like the end is not sharp enough to push back all the stubborn cuticles. It gets the majority, but doesn&#x27;t go above and beyond like what I wanted. However, I have only used it with dry nails. I imagine it would work much better if I soak my nails first. I recommend this product considering it was only about $5 and is stainless steel so you know it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as it&#x27;s stated and is made of good quality material.&lt;br /&gt;and should last a very long time. This is one of the best tools that I own&lt;br /&gt;and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> i may not know how to use it</li>
    <li> Different than what I expected, because I&#x27;ve not seen one like this before. Pushes back with ease, and the nail cleaner is nice, too.</li>
    <li> I loved the cuticle tool and it arrived so fast.  Thanks all, I&#x27;m addicted to Amazon, and I can&#x27;t wait to place my next order.</li>
    <li> I really like this tool for cuticle care especially for dry manicures.  It is very sturdy and well balanced when using it.</li>
    <li> I use the cuticle pusher to prep nails for shellaq which I do at home. It is also good for removing shellaq polish - after soaking nails in acetone for a couple of minutes, the polish comes off easily if I use the cuticle pusher to gently lift it off the nails.</li>
    <li> This was very helpful to scrape off gelish polish with out damaging nail bed. It is very sturdy, a good weight and feel in my hand.</li>
    <li> This tool works just fine. Just like the salon tools.  Tools for chicks.  It is great.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have always looked for a better tool that would push my cuticles back and this tool works great.  The tool came quickly in the mail and everything worked out great!</li>
    <li> Thank you for such a great tool!  it makes the shape of my nail wonderfully natural and cleans up well.  Natural manicure without any pain!</li>
    <li> This works better than I thought it would.  Gets more of the nail than the smaller products do. I was impressed.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for! I needed it to manage my cuticles when giving myself a manicure.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t push the cuticles back well for me.  I would not reccommend this tool. It just seemed to rub the skin instead of pushing it. So if you are looking for a tool gentle enough for a child this is it. Although it may be to large for childrens hands thats about all I could do with it.</li>
    <li> Have found a better one though. Hard to see what you get by pictures alone in this case.  I like seeing and holding items like this to purchanse.</li>
    <li> I am not a nail tech, but this tool works great for my at home use!  Easily pushes back my cuticles and makes my nails look perfect.</li>
    <li> I love it. So glad I finally purchased something like this! Nice substantial tool that does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
    <li> Like any good tool, this cuticle pusher makes the job of a manicure much easier.  The texture makes it easier to hold, even in your non dominant hand.  The metal is strong and the rounded end is perfect for my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Works fine and on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my nail tech use it on me. It really takes care of the cuticles without any pain or tearing of the skin. I do my own nails now and find it easy to use in either hand, also I use it to take off any old polish and it works very well doing so.</li>
    <li> Great tool! Though the tip could have been a bit smaller but it still does the job!! Comes in a nice package where I can store it in after use.</li>
    <li> This cuticle pusher is amazing! Works great, real strong. Not made of crappy material. And best part is the price! definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I was looking at tools to use for a \\&quot;dry manicure\\&quot; before using my shellac nail polish. I almost purchased one that was listed for manicures, but its real purpose was to push back heavy cuticle that grows almost all the way up the nail.  This does EXACTLY what I want for a very good price.  It looks way more expensive than it is and it&#x27;s a very sturdy tool.[[ASIN:B003O4HW28 MEHAZ Cuticle Pusher]] is overkill and I came so close to buying it!</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, it seems to be a quality product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product over 6-7 months ago, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It&#x27;s a perfect must for DIY gel nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a tool to help remove shellac nail polish and it worked great. Also nice for it&#x27;s real purpose of pushing cuticles.</li>
    <li> I have been frustrated with out cuticle pushers and after a rare but recent manicure, decided to get the same style took the pros use. Even my awkward left-handed trimming can&#x27;t make my cuticles look goofy now! The metal is smooth enough that it doesn&#x27;t cut or scratch your nails :)</li>
    <li> I like it fine. very sturdy and functions well. I however seen others after I PURCHASED WITH RUBBER GRIPS THAT i WOULD LIKE BETTER. nothing like it in the stores around here.</li>
    <li> This is a big cuticle pusher but it is good quality and of decent weight. It isn&#x27;t flimsy at all. Best probably for toes.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I are doing our own mani/ pedi&#x27;s now because we don&#x27;t want to expose our hands and feet to the diseases and germs of the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is heavy, sturdy, and appears to me to be professional grade equipment.  The ends are perfectly shaped to groom and clean up cuticle, and gently push it back.  Excellent addition to my manicure/ pedicure equipment which is used by two daughters and me!  I wish I&#x27;d bought this handy tool a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Very good tool! I had a couple of them in the past but this one is my favorite now! Works perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for a while and I found it on good ole Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure what the little end is for (toes?) so I use the longer end. It&#x27;s great to not only push back the cuticle but to also cut the cuticle that starts growing on the nail. I never thought I could get rid of that myself. Oh and MUCH cheaper than the one I saw at the beauty supply store. Granted this tool is quite wide, it&#x27;s perfect for my nails. If you have narrow nail beds, be careful.</li>
    <li> I liked the style with different tips at each end in order to push back the cuticle and remove old skin on the nails.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001B7PVRS Body Toolz Cuticle Pusher]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cuticle pusher does a wonderful job.  It has a very unique shape on both sides and each side performs the task of pushing back the cuticle very well.  The price is also a great value on Amazon.  I use it every time I do my nails.</li>
    <li> I use this tool all the time for manicures. It is very helpful and along with the OPI soak allows professional manicures at home to save some money. The blades are a bit large for my nails but still use able.</li>
    <li> This is the best cuticle tool I have ever used.  I can even used this on dry cuticles when I don&#x27;t have time to soak them.  The long end is tapered perfectly to get under the cuticle and release it from the nail.  The short end is perfect for pushing the raised cuticle back and up.  Paired with some cuticle nippers, I&#x27;m certain tool will help me decrease the number of trips I make to (as well as dollars spent at) my nail tech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if I could just figure out how to shape my nails like they do at the salon...</li>
    <li> This seems to be be a good quality tool. I don&#x27;t find it to be too large like other people have complained. Maybe they just have teensy-weensy nail beds. Works great for me!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality cuticle pusher. I use plastic ones too but this is hands down the best!  You will not be disappointed if you purchase this.</li>
    <li> This tool is awesome!  My friend has one that is very similar, I really loved it and wanted to get one for myself.  The one she has cost $35 and it isn&#x27;t as nice as this one.  Great tool at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy product.  I use for clean my nails as well as pushing back cuticles.  It&#x27;s a great tool for home manicures.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s a great sturdy product it is not as sharp as I thought it would be after reading some of the reviews.</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s a wee bit too wide for women&#x27;s nails. I purchased this product to help scrape off gel manicures, but the angling of the tool scrapes my nail bed...</li>
    <li> I thought I would use this more than I have, but it works quite well.</li>
    <li> Needed something to get the shellac polish off when I couldn&#x27;t get to the nail salon, works great. Great price as well</li>
    <li> Awesome! Wonder how I did my cuticles without it! Very durable &amp; effective!! There was no way I could purchase it at the local corner store!!</li>
    <li> Love this tool. Used it right away and it worked perfect. Made a difference in the quality of my DIY pedicure.</li>
    <li> So i ordered this along with a couple other things, came in almost a week and when I opened the package the plastic wrap that this cuticle pusher was in had already been opened! Which in my opinion is gross considering what you&#x27;re using this for, PERSONAL USE! So now I dont know who&#x27;s had this or where its been. Gross! And for the actual review of the product, it is a bit large but not just for my fingers, for my toes also. Maybe its more for mens feet? So I probably got someones return that also thought this product was not worthy! Invest another dollar into a better and you&#x27;d be happier!</li>
    <li> I read some reviews saying this tool has sharp edge that can cut. Mine does not have any sharp edge. I bought this to scrape gel polish off but it doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose.</li>
    <li> I have used this quite a few times now and really love it!  This cuticle pusher is very gentle or harsh if yo need to be to take off polish.</li>
    <li> I found the product was easy to use, easy to manipulate, and easy to store!  I have nothing negative to say about it!  It works!  GOOD PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> i use this with the Acetone tray and pure Acetone to take off shellac.  It is great!  It is better than waiting and half of the nail polish is off.</li>
    <li> I have gross mutant cuticles that have made a nail tech cringe on more than one occasion.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with them or what sort of weird recessive cuticle alleles I have, but no matter what I do, they grow back quickly and are TENACIOUS.  I had been removing them with one of those wimpy v-shaped cuticle trimmer things which was enormously gratifying to use (think of the grotesque satisfaction one feels when emptying a Ped-Egg).  However, frequent and probably inexpert use tended to cut into the eponychium a bit too much.  This is the ridge of skin between the cuticle, which grows in direct contact with the nail bed, and the proximal nail fold, which is the bit of your finger that grows over the root of the nail.  Confusing anatomy aside, I cut into it too much and it&#x27;d peel like crazy and look gross.  With this cuticle pusher and some Blue Cross cuticle remover (amazing stuff--basically a solution of lye and lanolin that denatures the protein bonds in keratin and makes it easier to remove the cuticle) I can remove my cuticles without cutting.  This tool has a sharp enough edge to scrape my ridiculous cuticles away without damaging my nail.  I use a circular scraping motion and am able to get most of the cuticle off, and use a pair of nippers to clip away the straggly bits.  The only thing that would make it better is if it had a curette/scooper thing instead of the short domed end, which I find good for doing the lateral edges of my toenails but not much else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cuticle pusher for a long time. I used to get my nails done in the salon and she had a pusher that was great but she wanted to sell one to me for $30 - which is ridiculous! And I&#x27;ve bought a few froma beauty supply that are just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS is PERFECT! It is a very well made pusher...thick steel. I use the larger fat push on my hands and the smaller on my toes. It does not hurt or cut my cuticles - it pushes. &amp;#60;You do NOT want to cut your cuticles - it ruins the skin for ever.&amp;#62;  EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;For the price - absolutely worth it! It shipped so fast it surprised me! From order to in my hands - 3 days flat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so much of a manicurist, so I&#x27;m not sure what to do with my cuticles.  I bought this to scrape off the old gel polish when I soak it off.  This tool is great for that and I&#x27;m glad I got it.  The rounded edges make it gentler than an orange stick yet it&#x27;s still got enough of an edge to get the stubborn bits off so I don&#x27;t have to file it off or scrape too hard.</li>
    <li> and the hooked end can really scrape, I think I&#x27;d prefer to get one without that short end and maybe have a narrower size of the other end. The &#x27;spoon&#x27; can be too big on small hands.</li>
