      <li>I love these cuticle nippers!</li>
      <li>it works, good quality build, my wife loved it so much that she bought 15 more of these things.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve used a lot over the years that cost way more</li>
      <li>Very sharp, but work great!</li>
      <li>This thing is very sharp and good for trimming hangnails, but I am careful and experienced in doing my own nails</li>
      <li>and with 15 orders, i think its good enough in my wife&#x27;s opinion</li>
      <li>But, these nippers cut really well when I use these for work, so I&#x27;m glad I bought these.</li>
      <li>Really sharp and good quality nipper.</li>
      <li>I bought a pair of these about 6 months ago for personal use and absolutely loved how sharp and precise they were.</li>
      <li>2 stars, however, because they are really sharp and do a nice job cleaning up cuticles.  </li>
      <li>Really like this cuticle nipper.</li>
      <li>These are at least as good as the nationally known brand costing twice as much</li>
      <li>They make a clean cut, are easy to control and the nipper head is small enough that you can see the littlest toenails.</li>
      <li>These are very sharp and precise.</li>
      <li>A couple of weeks ago, I was trying to give a litter of Chihuahua puppies their first nail trim and even my smallest dog nail clippers were really too big for their tiny toes.</li>
      <li>Thought about sending them back, but I really like this nipper.</li>

    <li> They are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used a lot over the years that cost way more</li>
    <li> I bought a pair of these about 6 months ago for personal use and absolutely loved how sharp and precise they were. A couple of weeks ago, I was trying to give a litter of Chihuahua puppies their first nail trim and even my smallest dog nail clippers were really too big for their tiny toes. So I decided to try these out and they were perfect for the job! They make a clean cut, are easy to control and the nipper head is small enough that you can see the littlest toenails. I&#x27;ve only used them on small pups, but I would think they might also work well for cats and birds. At this price, it might be something those with small pets might want to consider trying.  I just ordered a second pair so I don&#x27;t have to share mine with the dogs.👌</li>
    <li> This is not like the cuticle &amp;#34;nipper&amp;#34; that pulls a bit. I didn&#x27;t even realize that was the best kind. This thing is very sharp and good for trimming hangnails, but I am careful and experienced in doing my own nails and i cut myself almost every time I use it. Other people like it though, I think it depends what you are looking for. If you want the traditional &amp;#34;cuticle nipper&amp;#34; like they use in the nail salon, this is NOT it.</li>
    <li> Great nippers for the amazing price! Very sharp! I&#x27;ll be definitely reordering it again!</li>
    <li> Could&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for it being an obviously used, and dirty item.  Why would the seller send something so filthy... I don&#x27;t know.  2 stars, however, because they are really sharp and do a nice job cleaning up cuticles.  Tried them out after a thorough cleaning.  Thought about sending them back, but I really like this nipper.</li>
    <li> Really like this cuticle nipper. Very solid for the price.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied customers</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price!  Have used a pair once before!  Dropped other pair on porcelain tile... Big no no! Bent the tip!</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and precise. These are at least as good as the nationally known brand costing twice as much</li>
    <li> Very sharp, but work great!</li>
    <li> Sharp.  Working great.</li>
    <li> Really sharp and good quality nipper. It was a such a surprise because the price is very low for the quality</li>
    <li> it works, good quality build, my wife loved it so much that she bought 15 more of these things. tho i dont know what do do with them, my wife does. and with 15 orders, i think its good enough in my wife&#x27;s opinion</li>
    <li> I love these cuticle nippers! I bought two just in case because I know that I&#x27;m gonna drop one. But, these nippers cut really well when I use these for work, so I&#x27;m glad I bought these. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Very happy with these nippers!</li>
    <li> i love this so much good good god good&lt;br /&gt;good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
