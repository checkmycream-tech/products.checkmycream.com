      <li>I am sure that is because it is a mist and not the perfume.</li>

      <li>2 more got them in 2 days</li>
      <li>/&gt;To summarize, definitely one of the best BBW body mists I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Love the scent of this.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this scent in the store, but it was way out of my price range.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and I have to say, Midnight is my favorite.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is lovely, As always Bath and Body gave me a great price on something I really Like.</li>
      <li>The bottle is lovely as well.</li>
      <li>This is awesome and way cheaper than getting it at the actual store.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Very rich and creamy.</li>
      <li>This size lasts me a long time, I already know, and I look forward to using this for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about it, is that the scent isn&#x27;t very strong, which means I can build it up when I want, or let it stay light and airy, just a hint of the smell.</li>
      <li>but it smells pretty darn good</li>
      <li>i love this spray it smells sooo good and shipped fast</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried Viva La Juicy, it&#x27;s a very sweet and girly floral scent.</li>

      <li>Girlfriend loves it, but I give 4 stars because it&#x27;s quite strong.</li>

      <li>and I do enjoy the sniff at her neck.</li>
      <li>Arrived in a good amount of time, even during the busy holiday season, quick and easy transaction, no problems.</li>
      <li>(I have very distinct scent preferences).</li>
      <li>I live far away from the nearest bath and body store, so being able to order from amazon was great.</li>
      <li>What I love the most about this perfume is that it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband&#x27;s allergies, since he seems to get headaches from most of the perfumes I have purchased from BBW (my old favorite - Honeysuckle, he was REALLY allergic too).</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a nice, sweet perfume, I highly recommend checking this out!</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like Viva La Juicy, but it&#x27;s much more affordable.</li>
      <li>I had purchased at Bath &amp; Body Works last year and wanted more, I searched Amazon and for a amazing deal.</li>
      <li>She had a huge smile and gave me a huge hug for getting it for her</li>
      <li>Good product overall</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can not get enough of this scent. The price made so easy to make the decision to buy some more in the very near future. I would definitely recommend this perfume to everyone. The smell, price, and convenience of not leaving home to shop are so nice. 8.4 oz is a lot of perfume for the money.</li>
    <li> She had been talking of this fragrance for several months but wouldn&#x27;t see clear to spend the money. Was well worth the smile and I do enjoy the sniff at her neck.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the fast shipping! It&#x27;s bigger then I expected, awesome! Smells great and will buy again when this one is finished!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my granddaughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Love this sweet fragrance.</li>
    <li> An excellent gift I&#x27;m sending to my friend in New Zealand who loved this scent.</li>
    <li> Receive the perfume quickly.  The price is great for the size.  I would recommend the purchase.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a deep, sweet, floral scent, then Forever Red is for you. For me, this scent is a little too sweet, almost like candy. The mist only lasts about 2-3 hours, which is personally not long enough for me. I think that if I had the perfume in this scent I would probably wear it more often, but the perfume is so expensive, and to spend that much money on a scent I am not really in love with would be sad. Yes, the mist is colored red. I found that out the hard way when I wore a white shirt one day... :(&lt;br /&gt;I bought Forever Red and Forever Midnight together one day to try them out and I have to say, Midnight is my favorite. It&#x27;s a lot more grown up, and a lot less sweet.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#x27;t think I would personally spend money on any other Forever Red products, that is if B&amp;BW comes out with a Forever Midnight line. ;-)</li>
    <li> My favorite scent. Good price for this size too.</li>
    <li> i love this spray it smells sooo good and shipped fast it is just as pictured very beautiful bottle great buy you cant tell its different from the actual perfume</li>
    <li> Love it. it came early too and my favorite perfume ever it is a must try do it. Ok ok</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this. I smelled it in the store and went home to think about it, but had to have it. The only negative I would say about it is the scent is not that strong and hard to smell after a short time. I am sure that is because it is a mist and not the perfume. My suggestion would be to buy the perfume.</li>
    <li> Purchase for a gift and my wife loved it. She had a huge smile and gave me a huge hug for getting it for her</li>
    <li> Excellent price and product!  Super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Got one for my daughter in law but when it came in I loved it smells great so I went and ordert one for me too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a gift. She and I both really like the smell and it has a cool name to go with it!!! LOL!</li>
    <li> The best ever! I love Forever Red Fine Fragrance. I had purchased at Bath &amp; Body Works last year and wanted more, I searched Amazon and for a amazing deal. Try it you will love the scent............</li>
    <li> great product. I love this product such that I cant even express myself. you are doing a good job selling good product. It is good for me and I believe anyone should consider buying this product if they really want something very good.&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking about buying a second one. yours is exceptional!</li>
    <li> Whenever I wear this fragrance I receive compliments from men and women, wherever I go. Received it as a gift &amp; now am giving Forever Red as a gift. absolutely beautiful : )</li>
    <li> Fast &amp; everything was perfect</li>
    <li> Personally love this perfume, but when purchased I received a smaller bottle than descripted, and the lid is already broken and missing half of it. Not buying from this user again.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it, but I give 4 stars because it&#x27;s quite strong. Smells alright but not my favorite, but she loves it.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I was able to find this product. I live far away from the nearest bath and body store, so being able to order from amazon was great. Arrived in a good amount of time, even during the busy holiday season, quick and easy transaction, no problems. Look forward to my next purchase!</li>
    <li> I recently had the chance to review this perfume courtesy of Influenster.com as part of their Cosmo VoxBox campaign and I have to say, this is my favorite BBW perfume. It is a sweet, floral scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and a great everyday perfume. What I love the most about this perfume is that it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband&#x27;s allergies, since he seems to get headaches from most of the perfumes I have purchased from BBW (my old favorite - Honeysuckle, he was REALLY allergic too). If you are looking for a nice, sweet perfume, I highly recommend checking this out!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my mother-in-law for Christmas and she loves it. Im going to get myself some as well. it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Inviting fragrance! My wife and I love and perfume and will be purchasing more in the near future. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells really good.</li>
    <li> I received this item so quickly!  I would rate the sellers a 5 and the scent a 5!  this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I received this as a birthday present and had low expectations (I have very distinct scent preferences). However, this is definitely my favorite, to my pleasant surprise. It smells exactly like Viva La Juicy, but it&#x27;s much more affordable. If you haven&#x27;t tried Viva La Juicy, it&#x27;s a very sweet and girly floral scent. I&#x27;ve always preferred fruity scents over floral ones, but this fragrance is one that everyone should try (and will probably come to love).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had problems with the fact that BBW body mists don&#x27;t last a long time, but this particular scent stays on for over 4 hours. I also spray some in my hair instead of just around my neck area for a long-lasting effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, definitely one of the best BBW body mists I&#x27;ve tried. Will consider getting the body lotion as well!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great and the undertones smell a little different on different people. Sometimes it can have a fruity and floral scent when paired with floral lotion or soap...or can smell more vanilla-y and the rum undertones come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USER BEWARE....the perfume itself is RED! just sprayed it on a my WHITE sheets to relax and enjoy the scent when I went to bed and now it looks like I had a BIG FOREVER RED ACCIDENT all over my white sheets.</li>
    <li> One of my good friends had this mist, and i fell in love with it the moment i spray my self with it.&lt;br /&gt;smells soo soo soo good. &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> wonderful fragrance that I love and have had people comment on how nice it smells, beautiful bottle that it comes in too</li>
    <li> very nice product with a great price compared to retail.</li>
    <li> Like it alot and possibly will buy it again. Wish the smell lasted longer. But definately got to try this!</li>
    <li> This is awesome and way cheaper than getting it at the actual store. Note that this bottle is plastic and not glass.</li>
    <li> Wayyy too costly for a mist but the bottle is quite large and the scent is the best b&amp;b works one yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted this body mist, only it was so costly in stores. I&#x27;m thankful I found a cheaper place to buy it. The smell is wonderful, definitely my favorite out of my collection of Body &amp; Body Works products. And shipping was super fast. It came within two days with standard shipping.</li>
    <li> Got some Red for Christmas and loved it so much I used it all; so I bought 2 more got them in 2 days</li>
    <li> This fragrance is lovely, As always Bath and Body gave me a great price on something I really Like.The bottle is lovely as well.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this scent in the store, but it was way out of my price range. When I found it for this prince online, I was super excited, and had to buy! I wear it all the time, and get compliments on it! This size lasts me a long time, I already know, and I look forward to using this for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about it, is that the scent isn&#x27;t very strong, which means I can build it up when I want, or let it stay light and airy, just a hint of the smell. Regardless, people remark on the smell, and how it&#x27;s so fresh and yet sexy at the same time. I&#x27;m forever in love with Forever Red!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and I get compliments about it all the time!! Beautiful sweet smell, it comes in a lovely bottle .. .</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this scent does not mix well with me but whenever I smell it on someone else, it smells amazing.  I like the fragrance alot, just not on me.  I gave this to a friend and it smells so awesome on her.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a wonderful smelling perfume you must try this..I&#x27;ve got many compliments &amp; people asking the name of it... Deliver is on point &amp; I usually receive it a day or two ahead of time :) completely satisfied</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for the price!!!</li>
    <li> I like it,,it smells good</li>
    <li> She loves it and its a lot more money in the store for a smaller bottle of it. Fast shipping had it in 3 days but said it could take a month, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The mist is great! The smell is really nice. I can still smell the mist the next day on my clothes!!!! Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> The product came quickly. But in the shipping the bow was very delicate and broke off.  I didn&#x27;t have time to get another one so I just kept it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because she said she wanted it. It was like 40 bucks I think. Not too, too pricey for perfume. Its a big bottle with a powerful smell. Smells really good. I&#x27;m not sure if she wears it... but it smells pretty darn good so I&#x27;d get it again for her. The bottle is pretty sick lookin&#x27;, too. I don&#x27;t know if girls care about that but the bottle is sick. Good product overall</li>
    <li> Smell good but is not that long</li>
    <li> loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it the bottle was beautifully designed and it costed much less from the actual bath and body works i still have to this day</li>
    <li> Very rich and creamy. To me its creamy cherry vanilla rum. I want to get the perfume next. Though the body spray stays in all day. I love it. Its sweet and sexy</li>
    <li> Love bath and body products smells clean .</li>
    <li> My husband bought me a gift set of this a couple of years ago, and I have loved the fragrance.  I just hate going into the malls to shop, so when I found it here, I knew I would buy it again!  It came well within the promised delivery, and I am now just spritzing my whole body with it to smell yummy for the day!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite scent by Bath and Body Works. I&#x27;m wearing it right now and it smells great!</li>
    <li> This is a soft but beautiful fragrance made by Bath &amp; Body Works! It has got to be my favorite perfume! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I was very upset that the item came broken.  The fragrance was great, but the Christmas gift came broken.  Not worth it to send it back because it would have been late.</li>
    <li> Smells so good!  I get compliments too.</li>
    <li> Good product! It&#x27;s a pretty big bottle ...The smell doesn&#x27;t last that long to me. I reapply every two hours.</li>
