      <li>I happen to love it.</li>
      <li>I bought more to stock up</li>
      <li>Love this sulfate free shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many products that claimed to help with that, but most of them made my hair look greasy.</li>

      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>better price than walmart...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t build up on their hair and it creates a nice tangle free result.</li>
      <li>that stuff is magic in a jar.</li>
      <li>For the glowing reviews on here I was expecting more.</li>
      <li>store was a great dealer with fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The smell is just ok, but I can over look that with the results.</li>
      <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;I always felt comfortable with L&#x27;Oreal products, and this one makes me feel my hair perfect, soft, manageable and moisturized.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>To be honest it doesn&#x27;t work as well as this smooth conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the rosemary smell.  </li>
      <li>I am on a quest to find the perfect conditoner for my dyed, fried flat hair.</li>
      <li>I buy many items from this L&#x27;Oreal line of hair products because they are sulfate free, work great, and are gentle to the hair.  </li>

      <li>but thought that it would fade since most shampoo and conditioner scents fade fairly quickly after use.  </li>
      <li>Very strong fragrance when I first used it</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;tt say it&#x27;s deep-conditioning, but this plus L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Haircare Total Repair 5 Extradorinary Oil, works great for me.  </li>
      <li>I chose it because it is sulfate free.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t color my hair but was hoping the sulfate free would help with softness.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like my hair looks smooth or conditioned.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell. It reminds me of a very strong men&#x27;s cologne. It&#x27;s so overpowering that when I put it in my hair I have to rinse it immediately and use another conditioner to mask the smell. It does make my hair soft but not nearly as silky as the Loreal Nature Therapy Mega Strength Deep Treatment....that stuff is magic in a jar.</li>
    <li> This product is great;; it DOES NOT strip color from color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner stinks.  The smell is very strong--kind of a woodsy musky mix.  I noticed it as soon as I used the product this morning but thought that it would fade since most shampoo and conditioner scents fade fairly quickly after use.  This scent, however, is an exception.  I washed my hair nine hours ago and the scent still exists in its inescapable glory, wafting around my head every time I so much as move an inch.  It is a decent conditioner but certainly not good enough to overcome the terrible stench with which it has enveloped my head.</li>
    <li> Obviously it is a personal preference, but I couldn&#x27;t disagree more with the previous reviewer. I think this conditioner smells great!</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal sulfate-free for curly hair works much better for my fine curly hair.  However, my head did not itch while using this.  (Sulfate allergies.)</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, comes out thick, and leaves my damaged hair very soft and workable</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Kinda herbal and fresh. And cleans my snarled hair nicely</li>
    <li> This is a great product for your hair.  Holds color and has no sulfate to dry out hair.</li>
    <li> I color my hair red, and red fades more quickly than other colors, but this conditioner and the accompanying shampoo really helps to protect it. It smells like Aveda&#x27;s rosemary mint conditioner...if you like rosemary mint, you&#x27;ll like it! I happen to love it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite low cost conditioners. perfect for color treated hair. makes hair smooth and easy to manage. I really dislike the smell though. That&#x27;s why I tried other conditioners from the same L&#x27;oreal Sulfate-Free series, but none of them worked as well as this one.</li>
    <li> I love the loreal hair products. This one is cheaper and with excellent quality. I recommend it. I already have being using for some time and intend to continue buying and using.</li>
    <li> The product works great, my only complaint is I wish it said the word conditioner in black and not in orange, it is hard to read in the shower and I have both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this line of low cost, high quality hair products specifically formulated without sulfates and salts to protect color treated and keratin processed hair!</li>
    <li> Best product in the market</li>
    <li> A friend recommended the L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate Free line of shampoos/conditioners. I was skeptical at first that it would really make a difference in my hair. I have dyed hair, that is pretty thick, with a slight wave in the back. Its usually really frizzy in the winter time so doing anything other then putting it up in a pony is not possible. With this conditioner, after using the shampoo I noticed an immediate difference in the texture of my hair, and there was little to NO frizz at all. Also, it was shiny and looked very healthy. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have baby fine, colored hair. This shampoo and conditioner cleans and conditions wonderfully. The smell is just ok, but I can over look that with the results. My hair feels great after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pair this with Redken Body Full Instant Bodifier Volumizing Foam, for Baby Fine Hair and my results are amazing.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use after getting a keratin treatment. Needed a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for colored hair. This product was awesome from first use. Made my hair super soft and silky. I bought more to stock up it worked so great.</li>
    <li> love the product .Helps my hair to be soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I would purchase again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact it is sulfate free-but it does not moisturize alot-which is what colored hair needs and it smells hmmmm not so great maybe I am used to most woman&#x27;s conditioners that leave a pleasant smell but this doesn&#x27;t do it for me in the fragrant dept-but based on price and the sulfate free-I would purchase again for everyday use and use my deep deep condition mask more often.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh herbal aroma of this conditioner.  I chose it because it is sulfate free.  Ordering it with the subscribe and save it is significantly less expensive than buying it at a local store.  I love the convenience of having my items delivered to my front door.</li>
    <li> When you hear it only takes a dime size amount of shampoo or conditioner, first thing you think is ya ok whatever BUT this great sulfate free shampoo and conditioner truly only take a tiny amount and leave your hair feeling so silky soft. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ll use this to see if it helps my damaged hair.  It&#x27;s heavily perfumed and not in a good way.</li>
    <li> I use thy I after I have my hair straightened at the salon. I need to use sulfate free shampoo and condition and this works great. Just wish it came in bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> I have rather fine textured hair, which means I get frizzies and flyaways in the humid summer months. I&#x27;ve used many products that claimed to help with that, but most of them made my hair look greasy. This is a simple solution! It controls the frizz without leaving any heavy buildup behind.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this conditioner, and it&#x27;s great on my curly (non-colored) hair.  I recommend it and will re-purchase!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this really helped out with my hair. It had kind of a funky smell and didn&#x27;t provide any noticeable effects.</li>
    <li> I have straight, fine, color-treated hair.  I wash and blowdry almost daily.  My hair was getting drier (over time) with my old conditioner, so I went looking for something that would condition well, be gentle on my color (and, thereby, my pocketbook!), but not feel heavy.  I read somewhere that sulfates are hard on color.  I figured I&#x27;d try this conditioner (and it&#x27;s matching shampoo, which I also love) since the price was more in-line with my value mentality, and I&#x27;ve been so pleased.  This conditions my hair without weighing it down.  I wouldn&#x27;tt say it&#x27;s deep-conditioning, but this plus L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Haircare Total Repair 5 Extradorinary Oil, works great for me.  All of these products last a long time, too, as a little goes a long way.  Again, a great value.  And nicer smelling than the few salon products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is like no other....if you can get past it not smelling floral...it has made my hair look the best it has in.years.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my colored hair, I won&#x27;t trade it for anything. My hair looks and feels awesome.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> I am surprised how much fuller and cleaner my hair feels.  Will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> I have a friend who always has perfect hair and asked for her secret. She turned me on to sulfate free shampoos and specifically this brand since it&#x27;s less expensive, can be found in most stores and smells amazing. My hair has been so much smoother and manageable since starting to use it.</li>
    <li> This series and this particular conditioner is becoming my most favorite! The quality is great and the price is even better. This conditioner makes my hair very silky and soft! My hair is a bit wavy, so in the morning I get shiny waves that hold for a while. And it&#x27;s sulfate-free! I will be definitely buying more.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  I have been a fan but this is the best ever.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite a while.  It leaves my hair feeling soft.  Good for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> This product is simply perfect, keeping my red hair red! :-)&lt;br /&gt;I always felt comfortable with L&#x27;Oreal products, and this one makes me feel my hair perfect, soft, manageable and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it frequently without problems.&lt;br /&gt;The store was a great dealer with fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try getting smoother/softer hair.  I don&#x27;t color my hair but was hoping the sulfate free would help with softness.  I&#x27;m not a fan but I didn&#x27;t want to knock down the stars because this product wasn&#x27;t intended for my intent.  Very strong fragrance when I first used it but now I&#x27;m used to it.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday.  Still looking for that wow factor for a conditioner to leave my hair silky soft with out paying a fortune!</li>
    <li> love this product for my hair, the best</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a shampoo and conditioner to replace my expensive salon brand. Unfortunately this is not it:( So greasy! and I don&#x27;t feel like my hair looks smooth or conditioned.</li>
    <li> better price than walmart...product is very good</li>
    <li> After sending my daughter to two other schools, she ends up in a beauty school, well.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She ran through the beauty &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; and then friends and family and it became time for me to donate my hair....for coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She insisted that I should have &amp;#34;speshul&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner, but seeing salon prices, I cowered in fear. After all, what school will I have to pay for next year?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I consulted my friends at amazon and purchased this without regrets. I really want to go on TV and shake my wavy locks and smile...but guys with receding hairlines evidently don&#x27;t sell hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was worried that I&#x27;d smell like a woman, but after thinking it over I concluded that they probably smell better than me in general anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend this duo of products if you want shiny, manageable hair that retains coloring longer....and if you&#x27;ll need the extra money to pay for another school.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product</li>
    <li> It is a great conditioner.  I buy many items from this L&#x27;Oreal line of hair products because they are sulfate free, work great, and are gentle to the hair.  My daughter loves all of these products that I buy for her!</li>
    <li> The scent is so strong I could not use it!</li>
    <li> Ya conocía pues lo he utilizado en el pasado. Este producto así que lo recomiendo. Ademas, el precio es bastante económico</li>
    <li> Stripped the red color it of half off my hair. Not sure why... but I can&#x27;t recommend this for puerile who dye red</li>
    <li> I have been using another product of Loreal&#x27;s Sulfate-Free line and it was good, but it didn&#x27;t work well with my hair.  I wear a straight bob and needed something that would smooth it out.  This works perfect and the conditioner is smells wonderful.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells better then the shampoo, but not by much!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Great price with coupon and subscribe</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair product snob. I can&#x27;t help it... I love salon brands and rarely have luck when I try a &amp;#34;cheapie&amp;#34;. However, this line from L&#x27;Oreal is really great. It reminds me of Aveda... very fresh, natural, aromatherapeutic smell. I have very thick, coarse hair and this leaves it silky and frizz-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this particular conditioner might be too rich for very fine hair. I like a heavy conditioner for my hair, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have very sensitive skin. Many products leave a rash on my hairline or bumps in my scalp. This is very gentle and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> I am on a quest to find the perfect conditoner for my dyed, fried flat hair. Sadly, this isn&#x27;t it. For the glowing reviews on here I was expecting more. But just because it doesn&#x27;t work fo rme doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll have the same results. Each hair chemestry is different, and mine seems to be picky.</li>
    <li> I like the product OK, but the smell is too much! I didn&#x27;t realize how overpowering the mint would be... I felt like I smelled like a stick of gum! Won&#x27;t be buying this one again until they change the scent.</li>
    <li> It is so important to condition colored or highlighted hair.  I love this conditioner and find it to be a nice complement to the [[ASIN:B001P1ZELS L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Shampoo, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s safe for color treated hair.  This product doesn&#x27;t strip or fade my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The nice smell.  I love the rosemary smell.  As a matter of fact, I wish the companion shampoo had the same smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  My hair always feels so smooth and silky after using this.  Since I have fine hair, I don&#x27;t use conditioner every time I shampoo, I use it only once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is a great value for the money.  This product works just as well as those expensive salon products.</li>
    <li> This product is great for curly/frizzy hair.  Definitely leaves your hair smooth.  Great product for curly hair I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this sulfate free shampoo and conditioner!  By far the best on the market for the price!</li>
    <li> Had to use for a bit before rating.  Now on my second bottle.  Really impressed with results.  My color stays truer longer and frankly I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often either.  Don&#x27;t know why that&#x27;s true.  But it is.</li>
    <li> Loreal is my mostly used beauty brand. This shampoo is great!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner really does what it says.  It offers you a smooth finished look.  I buy it for myself and my three daughters.  It doesn&#x27;t build up on their hair and it creates a nice tangle free result.</li>
    <li> My hair is unbelievably soft.  LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> When I was looking around amazon for a deep conditioner I came across [[ASIN:B001P24STG L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Restorative Masque, 5.1-Fluid Ounce]]. To be honest it doesn&#x27;t work as well as this smooth conditioner. So if you are trying to decide between the two this conditioner will make your hair more silky and soft. I&#x27;m very happy with it and my hair normally feels like straw. It seems each day I have to start over again and this conditioner makes my life easier. It also makes my hair super shiny unlike other conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past. Each day I use this conditioner my hair seems to be getting a little better. It is super damaged from a coloring experience. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a problem coloring my hair but it has sent me into a panic because I could not find anything to tame my unruly and straw-like hair. I guess you just have to experience it to know what I&#x27;m talking about. So when I ordered this conditioner I was pretty much ready to try anything. It doesn&#x27;t however work as well as a reconstructor that you leave in your hair for half an hour or as well as some argon oil conditioners I&#x27;ve tried recently. This is purely a daily conditioner with no real lasting effects. The minute you wash your hair you are going to need this again. But for now I&#x27;m fairly happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> This makes my hair very soft. I do have a bit of a time rinsing it out - but i think that may be because it&#x27;s supposed to STAY in my hair. LOL</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product because after having washed my hair for a day, my hair starts to feel and look dirty and greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner- it smells so good (never had a conditioner that smelled like rosemary!), and is good for dyed hair b/c it&#x27;s sulfate-free.  My girlfriends all raved about how good it smelled too.  :)</li>
    <li> After a week in the shower, the tube busted open at the seam.  What a mess.  Maybe this is why it&#x27;s being sold online?</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner works exceptionally well. I had been using Pantene Pro V 2-in-1 but it just never did the job. I tried Pantene Pro V conditioner, which initially worked well. Once I tried the L&#x27;Oreal EverPure conditioner, my hair felt silky soft even after a whole night. It smells great as well, it has a hint of mint but nothing overpowering. I only had to use a small amount for my hair to achieve the results I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars,  100% vegan, no drying salts, smells great, works great</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this myself, but my daughter likes it for her bleached and colored hair.</li>
