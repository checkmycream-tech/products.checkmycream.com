      <li>The first time I used it worked fine</li>
      <li>I thought this hair pik would fit my hot tools blow dryer</li>
      <li>it does not work with the hot tools hair dryer model 1031.</li>
      <li>broke the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>The Hot Tools 1125 hair pik fits my blower</li>
      <li>and I made sure it was no larger than 2 inches around.</li>
      <li>It keeps falling the whole time and it gets really hot</li>
      <li>My hair is so, so dry and this tool is ok for me to use, leaving my hair manageable and detangled.</li>
      <li>Fantastic - I will totally recommend it!</li>
      <li>This works really well.</li>
      <li>I love this comb attachment, but it does not fit my blow dryer.</li>
      <li>It works great for small areas because it falls off after a few passes through my hair.</li>
      <li>Seems that I cannot locate a new pik for the pink hot tools dryer that I have.</li>
      <li>I have a small compact\travel hairdryer and it seems to easily pop off with the slightest bump or pressure.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After I use this, I use the curling or flat iron and my hair is completely ready.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used similar products from various brands, including Hot Tools for over 15 years.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a long time for a nozzle that fits my older blow dryer.  </li>

    <li> This tool did not fit my dryer even though it specified it would. Disappointed!  If I could give this a minus star I would.</li>
    <li> it does not work with the hot tools hair dryer model 1031.</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. Don&#x27;t waste you money. The attachment wouldn&#x27;t stay on the dryer.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my thick and wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Does the job well when it stays ON the hairdryer. I have a small compact\travel hairdryer and it seems to easily pop off with the slightest bump or pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price paid it works well enough.</li>
    <li> I love this comb attachment, but it does not fit my blow dryer. I should&#x27;ve known the size beforehand I guess. It works great for small areas because it falls off after a few passes through my hair. It just doesn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Fit my hairdryer perfectly, does not fall off and the comb is very sturdy.  Fantastic - I will totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> It did not fit my hair dryer and I made sure it was no larger than 2 inches around. It worked for my friend&#x27;s, so I gave it to her. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I like this hair pick when drying my hair.  It directs the heat to my roots and lifts them as well.</li>
    <li> I thought this hair pik would fit my hot tools blow dryer but it did not the pik was too wide for my blow dryer. Seems that I cannot locate a new pik for the pink hot tools dryer that I have.</li>
    <li> I got this to go with my Babyliss handheld dryer.  Although I do not use this a lot, when i do, it makes everything a lot easier.</li>
    <li> I did not like it.  The first time I used it worked fine but then it did not stay.  It keeps falling the whole time and it gets really hot so you cannot hold.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it!!</li>
    <li> The Hot Tools 1125 hair pik fits my blower but it keep popping off , which made doing my hair harder.</li>
    <li> I did buy this before in a local store, but got broken after a few uses. Now, I did buy this recently and I just love it. I can dry my hair in approximately 20 minutes very well. It is very easy to handle and my hair is perfect. After I use this, I use the curling or flat iron and my hair is completely ready. My hair is so, so dry and this tool is ok for me to use, leaving my hair manageable and detangled.</li>
    <li> This works really well. The teeth haven&#x27;t broken off like other reviewers say and it has decreased dry time significantly.</li>
    <li> Fit my dryer! Other attachments fall off or do not fit! This did.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a long time for a nozzle that fits my older blow dryer.  This did perfectly!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used similar products from various brands, including Hot Tools for over 15 years. This one must be a dud because a tooth breaks off after each use, even though I am extremely careful to comb through my hair and only run small sections through the pik.</li>
    <li> it fits! I have been meaning to get a pik for my hair dryer forever and this one fits perfectly..another great amazon purchase :-)</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this to dry/straighten her very thick curly hair.  She loves it.</li>
