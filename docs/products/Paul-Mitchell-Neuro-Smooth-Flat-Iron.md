<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it only straightener that I can use on my hair and get it done within a few minutes and have amazing results!</li>
    <li> This  is Amazing!!!! I wore braids for a year and decided  to  wear my hair natural with no perm but didn&#x27;t  want to use a pressing  comb. This is the truth...hair stayed straight  for 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Love this straightner.  Better than a chi</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Works great:) highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughter is happy with this</li>
    <li> I feel in love with this product when I first saw in it person and I had to have it. I waited some time and I finally got it at a great price. My hair is natural and I love to strengthen it with this flat iron. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> When I got it and started using it I noticed that the plates didn&#x27;t close completely only at the top part and I had to press very hard for it to touch. I returned it and got my refund. I am wondering if I should order a new one or just a different one</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!! Heats up within seconds. Hairstylist recommended &amp; it&#x27;s def worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a really great flat iron.  I can straighten my hair in half the time it used to take me.  By far the best flat iron I have ever owned.  Well worth the money. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and my hair comes out silky smooth! Love it!!! I&#x27;ve tried many other straightening tools and this is by far the best!</li>
    <li> Its a pretty good flat iron, but for the money I expected it to be great - I still see where it is damaging - and I didn&#x27;t expect that from the flat iron that boasts what it does.  It has great features though.</li>
    <li> Such a great straightener I&#x27;ve had for a while and it&#x27;s amazing. Totally worth the money ! And it warms up in just seconds</li>
    <li> Wow!!!!! I have owned many flat irons in my life and this one is by far the best of them all!!!! Forget Chi and Baby Bliss this is the way to go. It heats to 400 in literally five seconds. It takes me half the time to straighten my hair than it normally does. My hair is so frizzy in the spring and summer but with this it stays smooth all day! It&#x27;s worth every penny if you straighten your hair several times a week. I&#x27;m not sure how I ever lived without it!!! My hair stylist used a very expensive $400 straightner and when she tried this she was amazed and immediately ordered one for herself. I can&#x27;t rave about it enough!!!</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and have searched for a flat iron like this for years.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  I can&#x27;t believe I can get the flat, sleek look I&#x27;ve always wanted.  It heats up in an instant to 380+ degrees, but even at those temperatures my hair looks health and shiny.  Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I purchased this and 3 months after it fried my hair. After having it and 290 the heat settings went up by itself. When I looked at the  iron the digital temperature was blacked out. I pressed every button and  nothing worked. So I disconnected it. I though it maybe was a short. I tried it a few days later and it turned back on. Same thing happen the heat setting went all the way up. Fried my hair again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a replacement in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 02/06/17 - Again burned my hair . Heated up by itself. would not turn on. Same problem as before. I really like how the iron works at the beginning but don&#x27;t understand why after 2 3 irons later it does the same thing!</li>
    <li> This is the best iron I have used in fifteen years.  I have been straightening my hair since I was in high school, I used to use a blow dryer and a brush..  My hair would always end up frizzy and pouffie, I looked like a poodle.  My hair is on the thick coarse side and it takes an hour to straighten with most flat irons.  Paul Motchell Neuro Smooth flat iron is very good.  It works very fast, as it only took me half an hour to do my hair.  I had used the chi flat iron for seven years before this flat iron and the results were not as good.  This flat iron keeps my hair flat and smooth.  The flat iron heats up very quick to 450 and if you hair is thinner, the lower setting works best.  I just love this flat iron and wish I had discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron&lt;br /&gt;I went to the paul mitchell school to get my hair done, and ended up picking up this straightner because I needed a new one.&lt;br /&gt;this smooth iron has different settings based on your hair type. I have super fine hair and it made my hair so straight and silky. Im def a fan.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice flat iron. It is a huge step up from my previous T3 which admittedly is quite a few years old by now. Highly recommend this iron!</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron! Ready to use in 30 seconds just like it says and the programmable feature is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!! I can now get my hair done in half the time that it took with my old straightener. Definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> This thing is expensive, but if you flat iron your hair more than a few times a year, you&#x27;ll love it.  She loves the ability to set the controls, and the auto shut off is a must.  She has owned multiple flat irons, from Chis to Crocs, and she love this one the best.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves it.  She is a hair stylist and the end result according to her is excellent.</li>
    <li> Straightens my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, and leaves my hair smooth and not staticky like the cheap ceramic straightener you can get at Walmart. Also heats up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t lose heat while you are using it. I&#x27;ve only used it once but it seems to be pretty nice. I usually keep my hair in a ponytail because it would take too long to straighten it decently. Now I will be straightening it more often because it&#x27;s way easier and quicker.</li>
    <li> This is literally the greatest thing ever. For years I used just cheap conair (when they first came out) and then I got a chi. Then when it prove I got a Paul Mitchell pro tools smooth and it was so much better than the chi. I&#x27;ve used it for over 3 years and it&#x27;s wearing out.  I decided that I should get a new one in case that broke. I got a babyliss nano titanium 1 inch. Worst straightener ever. It pulled my hair so bad I couldn&#x27;t even stand it anymore (not tender headed) and it wasn&#x27;t even straightening my hair. The neuro smooth doesn&#x27;t pull hair and is so fast at heating up. It takes me usually around 30 mins (blow dried) and 45 (air dried/went to bed with it wet) last night I went to bed with it wet (that&#x27;s when my hair is at it&#x27;s worst and kinkiest) turned the neuro smooth on 450 and it took me 8 mins. My hair was board straight and PERFECT. Best. Flat iron. Ever.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Flat Iron! I have thick, frizzy and course hair. I had another Paul Mitchell Flat Iron for over 5 years (which I also loved) and it finally went out on me. It heats up so fast and I love the digital heat control. I highly recommend this product. My mom and I have the same hair and I just ordered one for her today.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because my chi broke. The result is amazing on my thick wavy hair! I would recommend this flat iron to anyone desiring beautiful straight hair! Watch out it gets really hot.</li>
    <li> gets extremely hot,love the different settings very nice</li>
    <li> I Dyed My Hair Red And It Took The Color Completely Off On 390 Degree Heat. Other Than That It&#x27;s A Great Flat Iron That Makes Hair Silky. Good Thing I Tested It First!</li>
    <li> stop wasting your time with cheap flat irons. My hairdresser recommended this one and I can&#x27;t thank her enough. Just be careful with the temperature. It gets really hot</li>
    <li> Salon quality all the way.  Much, much better than ceramic plates.</li>
    <li> It is a nice straightener. I wouldnt really say that it is worth the money though. Maybe a different Paul Mitchell Straightener would be better. My hair is curly and frizzy and I thought this would help with the frizz but it didn&#x27;t do much for it... it does make my hair soft and straight.</li>
    <li> Love all Paul Mitchell products!</li>
    <li> Its an amazing straightner, does exactly what it says its going to do. I straighten my hair and it stays all day without frizzing. It stays smooth and shiny and may I also add that I wake up to perfect staright hair in the morning! Yes, that&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter &amp; she loves it. Seems well built and I got it for a good price.</li>
    <li> The gift was well liked by GD.</li>
    <li> I loved it, but I only had this item a month and it started smoking and will not work now. Guess it fried</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! It is exactly what the description says!! A high end and professional iron. My daughter has taken it over so now we will order her her own. She is very picky about flat irons because she has long and very thick wavy hair. When she used the first time she had pretty straight silky hair in no time. Would recommend this product a try.</li>
    <li> This flat iron burned my hair to a crisp right after a trim. My hair dresser said it&#x27;s happened to several other clients as well. I have the green one, works great. This one is HORRIBLE! I can&#x27;t wait until my hair grows out!</li>
    <li> Love this. Doesn&#x27;t catch on my hair and leaves it smooth, straight, and shiny. Heats up in literally 5 seconds.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.  So worth the money.  My hair is thick and it straightens it so flat and straight.  It doesn&#x27;t even take long.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by saying I purchased this from an authorized PM seller. LoxaBeauty if anyone is interested, whom I&#x27;ve never had an issue buying from before now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer stated, the plated on my iron didn&#x27;t close evenly either and instead touched at the tips unless I squeezed them quite tightly which lead to crimp lines in my hair. If I DIDN&#x27;T clamp it that tightly, my hair would quite literally just slip straight out from between the plates. I included a picture of the iron held up to a light to show what I mean. I used the same amount of pressure as I would to close my old iron almost entirely (it&#x27;s old so the plate cushions are worn quite significantly on that one and it doesn&#x27;t close totally so that amount of exertion should more than shut these plates). These plates literally only meet on a small corner on the front of the plates. Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my normal 350 degree heat setting for flat irons this failed to straighten my ends and instead oddly smushed them together. Turning the heat up to 390 resulted in my hair literally smoking and my ends looking frazzled and clearly burned. Good thing I tried it out on an easily hidden part of my hair I guess. On top of those major issues, the iron just feels cheap. It&#x27;s lightweight and all, but the plastic doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy at all. Holding it, I felt as if it would crack and break the first time I eventually dropped it or knocked it off my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give some perspective to my complaints, my 6 year old GVP iron from freaking Sally&#x27;s does a better job of straightening my hair at only 300 degrees, and that thing doesn&#x27;t even heat up evenly anymore and frequently tugs and snags my hair. What a waste of money this was. I&#x27;m getting a refund ASAP and taking my money to BaByliss if I want a titanium iron so badly. Only good thing it had going for it is that it DID heat up quickly, but that&#x27;s about all it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Apparently people think this and other poorly rating reviewers bought fake irons, I find the attitude of dismissing all bad reviews quite misleading towards other potential buyers. If a product was poorly made or didn&#x27;t work properly it deserves to be brought to others&#x27; attention. I know I bought mine from a legitimate retailer, one that Paul Mitchell itself suggests buying from on their website. It was defective and failed to work anywhere near as advertised. People should be aware that there are issues with this particular product and said issues should not be ignored just because some other reviewers got lucky and received properly working irons.ons, I find the attitude of dismissing all bad reviews quite misleading towards other potential buyers.

    <li> Love this flat iron. My hairdresser suggested it to me. I get keritan treatments on my hair to keep it straight and this flat iron is fast and hot!! The auto shut off is great too!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had a conair straightner before this and it didn&#x27;t work on my hair. After going to get my hair cut, my hair stylist used this on my hair and it was amazing. My hair was silky smooth and shiny. It also would straighten the first time. I asked her what brand it was and after coming home I started searching for it online. It is a bit expensive, but it is worth it. I didn&#x27;t buy it off of amazon, but it is awesome.  Also make sure you buy it from a trusted source. There are a lot of fakes out there. The bad reviews are probably from people who bought them online and it turned out to be a fake. Make sure when you get yours you register it online, if it is a fake the official paul mitchell website will tell you. Overall by far the best hair straightener ever! Highly recommend it.  :)</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and this is seriously the best flat iron I have ever use, It makes hair so straight and leaves it with a shiny finish, and it comes with a two year warranty which is awesome...I highly recommend this to anyway who is looking for a reliable flat iron.</li>
    <li> I had the temperature on 360 degrees, not even the highest temp. and the iron burnt my hair.  Completely burnt off my bangs and the  left side around my face. I paid almost $200.00 to have my hair burned off.</li>
    <li> This is my third Paul Mitchell iron to purchase. I have absolutely loved the other two that I owned. This one however is not as good of a product as the two previous ones I owned. When you close the iron around your hair the plates do not completely close together. I have very thin hair and my hair slides right through without being straitened. I can grip really tight on the iron but then it pulls my hair out. This iron heats up super fast and I love that it has a timer. It the plates met together when you closed the iron it would be the perfect flat iron. I do not know if the one I was shipped is just a defective product or if all of the irons are now made this way.</li>
    <li> It is the nicest flat iron I have ever used.  Easy to use and like being able to set the temperature based on the condition of my hair.  Bought one for my daughter and then returned my Chi and bought one for myself.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse thick hair...this flat iron heats very quickly and irons my hair on the 1st pass. If you are looking for a great flat iron that WORKS...this is the best choice!!</li>
    <li> Ooh...Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> Worth the cost. Best flat iron I have ever owned. Hair is smooth and straight and hair styling time is cut in half.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! Best straightener I&#x27;ve had since the very first Chi in 2001. Have let several of my friends try, and they all love it too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new Neuro Smooth Flat Iron by Paul Mitchell.  After using it a couple of weeks, I have noticed that the appearance of my hair is healtheir and  less dry with a beautiful sheen.  Apparently the new technology is less damaging to the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who uses or wants to use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> works perfectly with my stubborn thick asian hair. Don&#x27;t have to do as many passes because the iron stays the same temperature after a single pass.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this flat iron.  It heats up very quickly.  It is very smooth and glides right through hair.  The digital display is also a nice feature.</li>
    <li> Okay disregard bad reviews.  If you&#x27;ve never used a professional flat iron you are in for something different and of course depending on your hair type you need to have the right setting.  I&#x27;m guessing if you&#x27;ve burned your hair off that is a user issue.  This iron does get extremely hot and literally starts heating the minute it&#x27;s turned on.  Definitely hits the 450 mark, if set there, within the 30 seconds.  So yes of course you have to be careful, don&#x27;t be dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick long corse hair.  I do use the 450 setting and I run this through my hair once and it&#x27;s stick straight.  No waves, no going back over it, I love it!!  I also love that I can wash my hair, dry it and once I straighten it with this iron and it STAYS that way.  I&#x27;ve noticed in the past when I do that I usually have to go back over my hair a little later due to moisture I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got stuck out in the rain for a second the other day, hair stayed straight and gorgeous!  No frizzing up.  Been using this for exactly two weeks and it&#x27;s saved me tons of time.  I also notice my hair looking a lot healthier and finer and it&#x27;s so so soft :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Paul Mitchell smoothing iron years ago that did hold in there strong for 3+ years and I loved it.  It finally saw it&#x27;s last day when the swivel cord went bad but I remember the quality.  If you&#x27;ve had that iron or have it now, you know how great that one is and this one is even better.  Surprisingly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the smoothing Paul Mitchell iron (my 2nd fave) and I&#x27;ve owned two Solia Irons since.......this one leaps and bounds is the winner!  Worth every penney.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is by far the best flat iron I have ever purchases. I&#x27;ve owned a chi , infiniti, babyliss and many others. There really is nothing negative to say about this product!</li>
    <li> Would give this 6 stars! I have curly hair that I air dry. I use Paul Mitchell Express Style for my heat protectant and Kendra Platinum Silkening Mist for extra softening and shine. My Stylist used all of these products and it worked!!! Easy to use on my previously unsuccessful hair!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing!  I love it</li>
    <li> Heats up so quickly you can wait until you are ready to use it and then turn it on.  Love it....was sent quickly too.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron but after owning it just 10 weeks it week up in smoke.  I sent it back for repair and what was expected to take 14 business days took 6 weeks.  They blamed me saying it was because I did not include the correct warranty form.  The form had all my contact information on it plus they had the original box.  It just didn&#x27;t make sense.  No one would write me back or call from the place it was sent in Staten Island.  I finally called someone at their customer support line (which is in FL).  The lady working there was great and got things moving quickly.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever used! Can flat iron my hair in less than 5 minutes. Well worth the cost! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever had! I am thinking about trying all the paul mitchell neuro tools!</li>
    <li> fabulous.  It does everything plus more.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great leaves my hair smooth and soft heats up quickly! Better then the chi and the u-smooth!</li>
    <li> Heats up in about 30 seconds or less and it makes my hair smooth and shiny.  Best one I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> I love it! Im able to do both me and my daughter hair in half the time. Ive only had it about a month so we&#x27;ll see how long it last.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed climatologist, and normally I use chi flat irons and I saw this one and tried it, at first I really loved how fast it heated up and placement of buttons, and after a few weeks I noticed it was burning my hair and trying the ends off! I have lighter blonde hair so it&#x27;s really noticeable. The flat iron even smells like it&#x27;s heating up too hot and burning but I only put the setting on 380 degrees. This is an awful flat iron and I will never buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have and owned two other Paul Mitchell straighteners and loved them.. (the green ones) This one sucks! It shorts out, but before it turns off it super heats and will burn your hair off. I have thick hair and I have always used my Paul Mitchell flat irons 410 this one does fine at that temperature,but every once in a while it will burn a chunk of hair and the hair falls out because it is burnt so badly. If you must have this one buy it from a Paul Mitchell licensed salon so they will fix it. If not you will be stuck with a 150 $ paper weight.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a flat iron that give you the same look/feel when you leave the salon, this is it!  heats up in seconds, and does an amazing job on my hair.  It stays the same temperature and does a really great job -- i have really long hair, and this iron is exactly what i needed!</li>
    <li> I just use the flat iron twice every time i used them it left my hair feeling soft and silky and i love that i can adjust the temp fast shipping</li>
    <li> A gift that was exactly what the gal wanted. She loves this.</li>
    <li> I had the old green ceramic flat iron before, and loved it. This one is so amazing, and really is an upgrade!!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener so much, I wish I could give it more than just 5 stars!  I have very thick, medium length, wavy caucasian hair, and I have gone through 3 straighteners before finding this one.  Before, it took forever and my hair was still wavy, but this straightener took me literally 5 minutes to straighten all of my hair, plus it lasted all day and looked great.  My hair is soft and smooth after using it.  This comes exactly as described, and it really does heat up in 30 seconds! I only went up to 360 degrees with mine, but it worked great!  Definitely love this straightener, well worth the money and I wish I had found this sooner.</li>
    <li> I have owned 3 Paul Mitchell straighteners, so when they gave out I tried the CHI.&lt;br /&gt;IT SUCKED. I looked at everything else, with my thick course curly hair, I couldn&#x27;t take ANY risks....&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give this a shot, with the technology I thought I can&#x27;t go wrong. And I was right...&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST TRY THIS! It is probably the best straightener I have ever used on my hair in my life.&lt;br /&gt;With my hair, it is so coarse this Iron does MIRACLES within 30 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;I urge you to buy this product, you will be happy you did! Will work on Coarse hair very well!&lt;br /&gt;I love this Miracle Iron!</li>
    <li> This one pulls out my hair and does not quite straighten the baby hairs near my crown. The Paul Mitchell silver iron with the silicone strips does a better job. This one made my tips very dry.</li>
    <li> it is very easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair.  Heats up immediately.  Everything I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Gave it four stars because it heats up quickly, but the shiny plates were not good for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I do love this. I usually use a HAI flat iron, but I thought it was cool that you can set the temp and that it heats up SUPER fast and SUPER hot. I still also recommend the HAI...</li>
    <li> I ordered my flat iron on Sunday night March 7th and received it on Tuesday March 10th . this flat iron is the best flat iron I have every had I flat iron my hair doing the chase method and my hair comes out super soft and straight with one pass it heats up super fast and works really great I recommended it to my friend and she bought it the next day . Great product</li>
    <li> Best money spent ever !! Love it!</li>
    <li> My friend and I went to New Orleans last month. She had just purchased this. She is a licensed hair dresser. I used it and it worked perfect. Even in the New Orleans heat. I wanted it so bad and could get it wholesale through my friend but my Chi was still working after 10 years. Well one morning I turned on my Chi and nothing. Gave me the perfect excuse to finally buy this. I use it everyday for my hair. Doesn&#x27;t damage it or burn it. If you burned your hair off please turn it down. Thin hair does not need 450 degrees of heat. My hair is extremely thick so it works perfect for me. I only run it through once right behind a comb. It creats shine and no frizz. A must get for everyday straightners. Its alot of money (i got my discounted Sorry) but its weill worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this iron.  Heats up fast.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it straightens here twice as fast as her previous straightener</li>
