      <li>You can use it to cure base coat, top coat, gel nails, acrylic nails, nail art, and more</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re not sure how much use you will get out of it and not expecting it to last forever.</li>
      <li>I gave this product a 5 star rating because it is the same type of professional UV lamp used in nail salon&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>so if I am not careful moving the dryer, the bulb will fall out.</li>
      <li>this mean that I haven&#x27;t been lucky with this purchase</li>

    <li> This was my first time using amazon and i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try it again, the uv lamp i order had different outlets that we don&#x27;t have in the US..</li>
    <li> Way better than getting ripped off at sally&#x27;s and buying the same thing for 60$. id recomend this to anyone who wants to do their nails at home</li>
    <li> Dries shellac manicures perfectly! Very happy with this purchase. Would recommend to anyone looking to do their nails at home and save some money</li>
    <li> Works as expected and a great price</li>
    <li> When I finally was able to the device because it has a European plug which was not in the description, two of the four bulbs did not work. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> The light bulbs are very sensitive to the touch .  You have to keep checking to make sure the bulbs are pushed in each time you use it.</li>
    <li> Got here sooner then expected does the Job got what i paid for wasnt as fantástic as i thought it would be .</li>
    <li> the light bulbs dont always work and i do not know what is going on but i used this product for school only</li>
    <li> I love this nail lamp. It is a great investment to save money on going to the nail salon and paying $25 for a gel manicure every two weeks. The only negative I have is that when I received it, one of the bulbs was broken. They are cheap to replace though.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 5 star rating because it is the same type of professional UV lamp used in nail salon&#x27;s. It is a great value for the money. Most of these lamps cost under $30.00 an pays for itself after using it two or three times. It&#x27;s worth it! You can use it to cure base coat, top coat, gel nails, acrylic nails, nail art, and more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;D.Woods</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy &amp; says it works great!</li>
    <li> Product did not work. Requested return,</li>
    <li> finally!! i got my own uv gel lamp. it works perfectly... just a ordinary uv gel lamp. nothing special to look for.. it works and im satisfied</li>
    <li> Product works well, I have done several gel mani&#x27;s since purchasing and have only noticed one thing that might be an issue in the future. When you are inserting the bulbs, you have to be super super careful and it took me a few times. One of the plastic clips that helps hold the bulb in broke so if I am not careful moving the dryer, the bulb will fall out. As long as you don&#x27;t make my mistake, this product will be perfectly fine. It&#x27;s just a little flimsier than one of the more expensive authentic curing lamps. But it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re not sure how much use you will get out of it and not expecting it to last forever. I will probably buy a nicer one once this one breaks but it seems this one will last for a little bit as long as I&#x27;m not too rough. Already got my money&#x27;s worth saving on going to the nail salon though!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot bulkier than I thought. I didnt realize it was for gel polish. It definitely doesnt work on regular  polish as I tried twice. Will he giving it away.</li>
    <li> Only two of  lights came on without a problem. I  not happy about this.</li>
    <li> This  nail dryer sucks does not heat up at all!</li>
    <li> This does not harden the gel as it should. Its flimsy and not well built, the fan cuts off and on when it wants to not when it should. Have to order another one from someone else.</li>
    <li> Bought as a b-day gift. She loved it .</li>
    <li> When my uv lamp  finally arrives for second time, this time just 3 bulbs were working this mean that I haven&#x27;t been lucky with this purchase.. I don&#x27;t understand why this product shows such a damages in its manufacture ... Not happy and again disappointed ...</li>
    <li> I received this and it never worked for me.</li>
