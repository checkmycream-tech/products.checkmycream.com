      <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream which I use mostly on my neck -</li>
      <li>I love No 7 products.</li>
      <li>No 7, I use several of their products this included and it is great!</li>
      <li>Love the Boots products and the fact that they don&#x27;t test on animals</li>

      <li>I love all the No7 creams and make-up.</li>
      <li>I have used Boots for over a year and love the results.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes your skin feel and look.</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>at this point in time, I love the product.  </li>
      <li>Love it just for the feel of it on my skin.  </li>
      <li>May work better in a climate with more humidity.</li>
      <li>Ok great!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>comparing toother products, the results are more notisable</li>
      <li>(This is James&#x27;s wife :)  </li>
      <li>Love this for night time.</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t speak for that part of the cream, but I love the way this makes my skin look.</li>
      <li>Love Boots products.</li>
      <li>I love Boots</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and feels clean.</li>
      <li>This cream is perfect for the VERY DRY skin person.  </li>
      <li>first time I tried it my skin felt good, not greasy, and the fragrance was light.</li>
      <li>and at 65 years old some change is great.</li>
      <li>could not be more excited, ran out and bought the night cream...</li>
      <li>Also, makeup is easy to apply over this product.</li>
      <li>and I can see the reduce of my fine lines.</li>
      <li>It kept my skin hydrated all night and that is important to me.  </li>
      <li>I have been using boots moisturizer for years and am so happy to find it online, especially when Target is out of the ones I want.</li>
      <li>Would have given it 2 stars except that it has a nice smell and is a decent moisturizer if nothing else.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nice affordable cream which would benefit younger women who&#x27;ve just begun to notice very fine lines under a magnified mirror.</li>
      <li>and this certainly moisturizes my skin, but does not sit on top of the skin.</li>
      <li>Nice, helps to keep my skin soft.</li>
      <li>This feels really good and soothing going on, but within a couple days my rosacea was inflamed and the rest of my face was red too.</li>
      <li>I am committed to using this entire jar because what I have seen so far shows me that this stuff is incredible.</li>
      <li>First time I have ever empied the jar of a moisterizer!</li>
      <li>This cream does not get absorbed into the skin, it stays on the surface overnight, clogging pores and getting into eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as good as can be expected.</li>
      <li>Light weight, leaving skin soft and smooth &amp; nourished.</li>
      <li>just right &amp; does the trick</li>
      <li>Not sure about firming, but a nice cream!</li>
      <li>She uses it daily &amp; says she will be ordering more when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
      <li>I got this for my mom &amp; she really likes it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The 2nd - 4th week I noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and my &amp;#34;squint&amp;#34; line in between my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Other than continuing to see my complexion look bright, seeing less of the fine lines, and continuing to feel that my skin felt very soft and silky; there were no other noticeable changes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve wanted to find one that met all my requirements, while having what I&#x27;ve read is the best in skincare for the particular problem I&#x27;m working on, and it can&#x27;t be so expensive</li>
      <li>I love the Very Dry Cleanser as well.  </li>
      <li>This  has NO Retinol which is great because not all of us can use such harsh wrinkle creams.  </li>
      <li>but I really like the feel on my skin.</li>
      <li>Well, this doesn&#x27;t lift and &#x27;luminate&#x27;, which I really didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
      <li>I bought this product after asking an 80 year old woman what she was using to make her skin look so fresh and moist</li>
      <li>The next day my face looked bright and my skin felt soft.&lt;br /&gt;After the first week I had a noticeable difference in some of the dark spots I have on my face</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really have the sagging skin or wrinkles (</li>
      <li>This has not broken me out and has helped with my dryness.</li>
      <li>if you use the foundation and the night cream you don&#x27;t really need a separate day cream...</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the results, My lines are less noticeable and my over all appearance has improved!</li>
      <li>Olay does better for less.</li>
      <li>I love the entire line of Boots No. 7 Lift and Luminate - especially this night cream.  </li>
      <li>but I am older so wishful thinking?</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good ! Firming ? Not sure about firming, but a nice cream!</li>
    <li> Saw this item recommended by a dermatologist  on &amp;#34;The Talk&amp;#34; so I thought I would give it a go.  It didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I wanted. I have very dry skin plus the Arizona climate plays havoc on your skin. May work better in a climate with more humidity.</li>
    <li> I saw this on a talk show, and it was so hyped up. But that&#x27;s basically what it is...hype. No visible signs of any improvement. It does moisturize, but doesn&#x27;t do all it claims. Don&#x27;t fall for the hype.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It was on time and as expected! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent night cream. Light weight, leaving skin soft and smooth &amp; nourished.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do one thing for me even after using it following the instructions.  Would have given it 2 stars except that it has a nice smell and is a decent moisturizer if nothing else.  Don&#x27;t waste the $25.  Olay does better for less.</li>
    <li> best nighttime skin cream really works and I&#x27;ve tried everything from clinque to Loreal to Lancôme this is cream outshines them all and for the price can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> Nice, helps to keep my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed...no change...period...a friend and I split it....thought one of us would come out b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l...NOT...did nuttin&#x27; for her either !</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see any visible difference in my skin but it feels and smells nice.  I need to use it for a longer period of time to evaluate.</li>
    <li> If there&#x27;s a difference, I don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful!  I&#x27;m 70 years old and it has truly helped the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Great been using for months.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect!!</li>
    <li> i love No 7 products.&lt;br /&gt;your skin feels great in the morning&lt;br /&gt;not too greasy...just right &amp; does the trick</li>
    <li> I love the entire line of Boots No. 7 Lift and Luminate - especially this night cream.  In fact, because of my very dry skin, I use the night cream in the morning and at night.  I love the Very Dry Cleanser as well.  I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin since I started using Boots No. 7 (3 months ago).</li>
    <li> This is the best. I love the way it makes your skin feel and look. I love all the No7 creams and make-up.</li>
    <li> OK, So I had been using the foundation for lift and luminate for about 2 months after a long battle with all the other foundations that caused some reaction to my sensitive skin that I almost lost all hope....it changed the texture and smoothed out my face, no reactions to the product... Ok great!!!&lt;br /&gt; I went online and did some research on boots and all the products they offered and had not decided on how to proceed until my Good Housekeeping magazine arrived and gave this product a GOLD WINNER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more excited, ran out and bought the night cream...NOW it has only been 3 days since I started using this night cream and the luminous clarity and smoothness on my face is VERY noticeable and it has only been 3 days!!!I can tell you if you are sensitive to creams and make up YOU wont be disappointed with how quickly you will see results.  This  has NO Retinol which is great because not all of us can use such harsh wrinkle creams.  If you are hesitating go read the Good Housekeeping magazine for Sept. 2013 issue or look for it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you use the foundation and the night cream you don&#x27;t really need a separate day cream...these are enough so that your face wont be greasy or shiny... Good luck beauties:~)</li>
    <li> This cream does not get absorbed into the skin, it stays on the surface overnight, clogging pores and getting into eyes. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love it just for the feel of it on my skin.  A tab bit expensive and i don&#x27;t see a reduction in wrinkles but I am older so wishful thinking?</li>
    <li> i do see improvement in my skin tone&lt;br /&gt;in comparing toother products, the results are more notisable&lt;br /&gt;i will recommend to friends and family</li>
    <li> Love Boots products. I am seeing nice improvements in my skin!</li>
    <li> I started using this night cream 2 months ago, same time I started using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair day cream.  Between the two of them, I am very happy with my results.  My skin is smoother, brighter, and even firmer.  I don&#x27;t find this greasy at all.  No flare ups of rosacea, either.  I&#x27;m 62 and very happy to see such noticeable improvement in my complexion.</li>
    <li> Consumer reports recommend this night cream as one of the best. I have been using boots moisturizer for years and am so happy to find it online, especially when Target is out of the ones I want.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after asking an 80 year old woman what she was using to make her skin look so fresh and moist and I have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner, the cream fills and smells good.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough for me to say if it works, but so far its doing the job.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin.</li>
    <li> Really nice cream.  Breaks me out a little but seems to work very well.</li>
    <li> This cream is like a silk soft and in the morning I still feel the softness and I can see the reduce of my fine lines. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I saw it advertised on a show. It claims to remove deep wrinkles within 2 weeks, but that I have yet to see. But I will say that the product does add moisture to my skin and it is not greasy. Also, makeup is easy to apply over this product.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with the results, My lines are less noticeable and my over all appearance has improved! I will not be without it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> No 7 products always did me justice. They are effective and affordable. I would recommend to my sister and friends who worship the sun just a little too much.</li>
    <li> I use this firming night cream religiously.  I have dry skin and this certainly moisturizes my skin, but does not sit on top of the skin. It penetrates.  I know because in the morning when I rinse my face before cleaning it  there is a soft protective film I can feel.  Which to me is a sign it has penetrated during sleep.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream which I use mostly on my neck - I don&#x27;t notice any difference at all in lifting or firming though.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, and does the job at a fraction of the cost of those other creams.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect and just what I needed for my skin. Awesome night creme. I highly recommend Boots No 7 Night Cream. It will give your skin a nice glow and even tone. Get a jar tonight and see what a great difference it can make for you.</li>
    <li> Remarkable product. I understand now why people everywhere are raving about No. 7. I&#x27;m going to purchase the entire line.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  It is thick and so moisturizing!  I received the product in a timely manner and it was well packed and it great condition!</li>
    <li> The BEST product ever and fair price</li>
    <li> Love this for night time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!!  (This is James&#x27;s wife :)  This was a Christmas gift and I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I love No 7 products. The packaging was however very difficult to be opened.</li>
    <li> This feels really good and soothing going on, but within a couple days my rosacea was inflamed and the rest of my face was red too. Back to Say Yes for me.</li>
    <li> I could see results from this moisturizer after only a week or two of use.  I bought this to help firm my neck, and it really works.  As do all of the No. 7 products.</li>
    <li> I am 58 with very dry skin that is also sagging around my jaw line and noticing some hollowness on my cheek lines along with some deep wrinkles on my chin. I am on day 3 of this cream and what a difference. Can&#x27;t wait to see myself at 2 weeks. My skin radiates and the tightening has already started and the deep wrinkles are softening.&lt;br /&gt;The difference is quite noticeable after just 3 days. I have used every cream on the market. I am committed to using this entire jar because what I have seen so far shows me that this stuff is incredible. My skin deserves the best. Good ingredients at an affordable price. I have found out the hard way that expensive does not mean the best by  any means. Expensive means they gotcha!</li>
    <li> Another of my favorites....wouldn&#x27;t be without Boots No 7</li>
    <li> Only a few days into using this cream but I really like the feel on my skin. Smells nice and feels clean.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in perfect condition.  After two weeks, I&#x27;m not beautiful but I think I can see some improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been playing around with anti-aging creams ever since I turned 40. I&#x27;ve wanted to find one that met all my requirements, while having what I&#x27;ve read is the best in skincare for the particular problem I&#x27;m working on, and it can&#x27;t be so expensive I can&#x27;t continue to use it if it&#x27;s one I like. So... to that end I tried Boots #7 Lifting and Firming Night Cream every night for 6 weeks, and this is what I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it my skin felt good, not greasy, and the fragrance was light. The next day my face looked bright and my skin felt soft.&lt;br /&gt;After the first week I had a noticeable difference in some of the dark spots I have on my face - I guess I got them at some point after having our 4th child - they crept up on me! I still have some - which I will continue to target.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd - 4th week I noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and my &amp;#34;squint&amp;#34; line in between my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Other than continuing to see my complexion look bright, seeing less of the fine lines, and continuing to feel that my skin felt very soft and silky; there were no other noticeable changes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice affordable cream which would benefit younger women who&#x27;ve just begun to notice very fine lines under a magnified mirror. Use with a daily sunscreen would probably keep those nastier lines at bay!</li>
    <li> at this point in time, I love the product.  The softness and coverage stays with you all day.  As far as did it help the wrinkles, yes better than any other product I have used. and at 65 years old some change is great. Use it with the serums</li>
    <li> I have used Boots for over a year and love the results. Smoother, younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> So strong smelling!! Absolutely no change on skin texture/firmness/etc after using the entire jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a pass on this cream.</li>
    <li> First time I have ever empied the jar of a moisterizer!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this product as it contains ingredients that are not healthy for you.</li>
    <li> Love the Boots products and the fact that they don&#x27;t test on animals</li>
    <li> I believed the reviews and have been happy with the results. I&#x27;m 71 and I&#x27;ve used lots of products over the years!  This one is a quality item. Nothing works miracles. It&#x27;s as good as can be expected.</li>
    <li> I love Boots No 7, I use several of their products this included and it is great! I&#x27;m 31 so I don&#x27;t really have the sagging skin or wrinkles (yet) So I can&#x27;t speak for that part of the cream, but I love the way this makes my skin look. Dewy, Radiant and Glowing, My pores have shrinked as well. I have combo skin, Dry and oily in T-Zone (Mostly Dry) and I get hormonal acne as well. This has not broken me out and has helped with my dryness. Love it will continue to use Boots No 7....And you can&#x27;t beat the price either, I paid $20 at Drugstore.com.....love this!</li>
    <li> Best skin cream ever. I have sun damaged skin and this cream has lightened my age spots not to mention how soft your skin feels</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect for the VERY DRY skin person.  Do not give up on it I have been using this cream over 1 year and have taken 10 years off my looks. Skin is looking moisturize and makeup looks great.</li>
    <li> It kept my skin hydrated all night and that is important to me.  When I wake up I feel refreshed and renewed.</li>
    <li> Use this nightly and my neck and under eye area have shown great improvements.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom &amp; she really likes it! She uses it daily &amp; says she will be ordering more when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Well, this doesn&#x27;t lift and &#x27;luminate&#x27;, which I really didn&#x27;t expect. I am too far gone for that anyway. It is, however, a great product. It goes on silky, makes my skin feel great and isn&#x27;t oily at all. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
