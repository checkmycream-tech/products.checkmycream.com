<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this a while ago but didn&#x27;t have an occasion to use it until now.  I have to say, the colors and the product far exceeded my expectation.  It went on easily and the colors are very bright and vibrant.  It stayed on all night - looked exactly the same when I cam home as when I walked out the door!  And it comes off with a quick swipe, so an added bonus!  If you are looking for bright colored eyeshadow that is true to color and lasts, look no further!</li>
    <li> The containers are small but the shadow is packed in there and will last forever. You don&#x27;t need much when your putting it on and the colors are beautiful and bright. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> makes beautiful shades of everything you can think of. love them in the black light too :) great buy. would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is really pigmented. I love it. Truly neon but there is a lot of fall out. Use with a good sticky base and apply before founation and you&#x27;re set. I really do recommend this</li>
    <li> This product came very quick. I absolutely love the colors! Very bright! As long as you put something on your eyelid to make it stick it will be as bright as its supposed to be.</li>
    <li> I love how bright the colors are and the variety you get for such a low price! My only complaint is that the red is not really red. It&#x27;s more of an red-orange color. But otherwise, great shadows.</li>
    <li> it doesnt stick really</li>
    <li> I received this item in time for the 80s party and the colors were really bold and looked awesome.</li>
    <li> all in good condition , thanks</li>
    <li> colors are vivid as shown but dont war well-not even using petroleum jelly underneath.</li>
    <li> I boight these not expecting to much. But these are amazing! the colors are so bright! looks just like the pictures. I plan on buying all the colors!!</li>
    <li> the bright colours are amazing however the lighter shades are just irrelevant... like the lilac and the dark green are somewhat yucky ...but I am very pleased because I purchased this for the fluorescent colours...and they are what I was hoping for and more!!!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t go on as bright as pictured....even with primer.</li>
    <li> In the images on line ,this product appears like a press powder. But in reality it&#x27;s a very loose powder. Could be very messy or a total loss if dropped while it&#x27;s open. But the color is poppin, but needs a base to achieve that look.</li>
    <li> I got this way faster than expected colors are bright and fun. Containers are smaller than I thought but still everyone loved my makeup for Halloween and a themed 5k run.</li>
    <li> They worked great on Halloween! Make sure you already have or that you order a primer with these. You only have to use a little so it will last forever.</li>
    <li> The colors are as vibrant as the pictures....I love them!!!  And they got to me before they were promised.  I am THRILLED with them!!!!</li>
    <li> If you want some wild and bright colors this stuff is great. It is as bright as the pictures say. The pink is a hot pink and the other colors are that vibrant. It is a powder which I don&#x27;t love powders but I was surprised that the powder went on so bright. I always have issues with powder because it is always so shear. I used a makeup q-tip to put it on because I think you would lose more product with a brush and there is a lot of colors. The containers are really small. It&#x27;s worth it, especially if your going to a club and want a wild look. It&#x27;s a good price for the amount. I love the pink, the orange and that dark blue the best! The yellow is a little shear, you have to pile it on more. I&#x27;m a very pale, Irish girl so it may be brighter on a darker skin tone but on mine it&#x27;s hard to see, plus I wear glasses too</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadow.it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I loved these eye shadows but when I realized that the makeup artist who creates the works names were blurred out, I was very disappointed. I will search to find the MUA and make sure they know that somebody is profiting off their work. So unfair. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t with a good conscious buy again. Too bad.</li>
    <li> These colors are amazing.  Absolutely impossible not to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO buy eyeshadow primer as recommended for the best pops of color.</li>
    <li> I love the neon colors/pigment! Need to make sure you put a base on your eye before you apply these, though (NYX Jumbo pencil in Milk is perfect).</li>
    <li> When I ordered this item I realize I really wasn&#x27;t putting my makeup on the right way and this product I love it now I&#x27;m putting it on the right way it brings out the brightness of these sweet colors so yes love love this product thank you for selling something to women so awsome!</li>
    <li> I could rave ALL DAY about how amazing these pigments are! When they say &amp;#34;ultra bright color,&amp;#34; they mean ULTRA BRIGHT COLOR!!!! Some of the colors glow in the black light (UV light) which is just icing on the cake! Great shipping as well! THANK YOU SO MUCH SELLER!!!</li>
    <li> These pigments are so adorable and bright. They are highly pigmented and true to color. They work best with shadow base or primer (for eyes) and a clear gloss (for lips). They even sent a business card directing me to their website where they have even MORE pigments that come individually or in set for a great price AND FREE shipping. Again,  it&#x27;s a wonderful that made a great addition to my makeup kit. I WILL be ordering from them again</li>
    <li> I recently made a purchase from myomake, that I inquired about with an email asking if I should take it up with PayPal. I wasn&#x27;t sure if possibly I made a mistake with the order. When I got the email back, they were incredibly unhelpful stating: \\&quot;do what you need to do you fool.\\&quot; Wow I have never received an email from a business like that in my life. Where is this excellent customer service? I would never treat a customer who just purchased something from my business like that. Very sad. I will not be a returning customer due to their sheer lack of respect.</li>
    <li> I ordered these pigments with some doubt that they would be quality--- they absolutely are!! The colors are bright and vibrant! Some of them brighter than a highlighter:) I would recommend any and all that love bright colors to get these!</li>
    <li> Needs a primer, but after that these colors are perfect. More than worth the money for them. I&#x27;d buy them again and again.</li>
    <li> Colors are amazing! Use a primer under to hold the color for longer and keep it bright. Glows in black lights.</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow the colors are bright and beautiful. I love how long it last. I can&#x27;t wait to get some my friends</li>
    <li> Very high pigmentation! Would recommend this for anyone&#x27;s makeup kit!</li>
    <li> Hard to work with since this is a powder form. I used Urban Decay&#x27;s primer. The color didn&#x27;t really want to stay on, especially when I started to try to blend it. Worked great to create colored lip gloss. Works good as eyeliner if you use water with it. You could probably use the shadow like that, but I can&#x27;t imagine trying to blend that. Not nearly as good as urban decay&#x27;s or Mac colors.</li>
    <li> Apply carefully. A little bit goes a long way, and I always need to clean the counter afterwards. Color is vivid and bright. Very fine powder.</li>
    <li> Happy with the colors, however it was supposed to be mostly powders not glitters so disappointed overall can&#x27;t use them</li>
    <li> There are no neon colors approved by the fda to be used near or around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;These have no added adhesion so use a sticky base, and use a thick sticky base because these will turn your eyelids colors.&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown mine away because they smell like tempera paint from grade school and when mixed with water the pigments just melt down... again makes me think of soap dyes or tempera paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would rather use makeup that has ingrients listed so I know what I am sticking near my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have these mixed into nail polishes.</li>
    <li> These are crazy small and expensive for what you get. They are VERY pigmented, however no labels to even know which color you like if you actually wanted to reorder singles. I ordered via the website since it was cheaper with free shipping and it took FOREVER! I ordered Mar 2 11 AM EST and did not even receive a shipping confirmation until 13 Mar. I finally received them on 19 Mar... and they supposedly came from Texas. I have collect ton of pigments but I would not order these again.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, hate the smell, hate the small containers but I was able to change them into larger round pill bottles. can get very messy</li>
    <li> Product is not as rich once applied... maybe I am not doing something right though... I will try this stuff out later and give an update</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, colors are extremely pigmented and blend well.  They are really nice eyeshadows. I would totally purchase this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> These colors are awesome, super bright and with the prefect eye shadow primer it will last all day. It you love eye shadows, you gotta try these.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!&lt;br /&gt;The colors are so bright and vibrant!!</li>
    <li> All the colors are GREAT! I love them all! These eyeshadows have some amazing pigments and are great for the price. It stays on all day without it looking like its running or fading or falling off your face. If you want the colors to POP use a primer. Overall this is a good eyeshadow. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase :) I&#x27;ll be back to buy more in the future!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of these shadows when I first purchased them, mostly because I didn&#x27;t believe they were as bright as they appear in photos.  But I am happy to admit that I was completely wrong!  These colors are super bright, and you barely have to use any to get a decent level of color and coverage.  Also, blending with theses shadows is incredibly easy.  As someone who uses MAC, Urban Decay, and other &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brands of cosmetics, I would say that these pigments are comparable in quality to the more expensive, top shelf brands of makeup.  The only difference is the packaging.  These come in small, clear plastic pots and are shipped together in a plastic bag.  So the packaging is not as appealing, but it isn&#x27;t really about the packaging, is it?  For the price, this is an AMAZING deal, and I will definitely be purchasing more MYO pigments in the future.</li>
    <li> I love love love love love this eye shadow!  the first time I wore it I received many compliments! I would buy it again and recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like these loose pigment shadows. A little goes a long way. When used with a white shadow base the colors come out truer and brighter. They are easy to blend.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to wear the colors on my face yet. Once they arrived, I tested them on my hand. They were very colorful and bright, so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll pop and look great on my face on top of eyelid primer. Can&#x27;t wait to actually wear them! Order came in the time expected. Item was neatly and properly packed for shipping.</li>
    <li> My package came on time,it was love at first sight..every colors are so bright no messy spills wrapped great! You can use these colors with or without eyeshadow base their just so bright thank you I will be ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and nicely pigmented.</li>
    <li> DO NOT SPILL THESE!&lt;br /&gt;The green spill in a beige-interior car before a show a year ago and we have yet to make the stain less bright AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need a nice contoured brush to keep them separate because if you even spill a little bit out of place, you&#x27;re stained there and have to start over.&lt;br /&gt;Use a white primer on your eyes and spray a little hair spray over it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve fallen asleep and still had this s*** on perfect in the morning. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, all the neons are actually UV reactive.</li>
    <li> Love the high pigment long lasting colors !  Girls best friend the only down fall is they are tiny n look so much bigger on the pic. But fast shipping n works great</li>
    <li> I love this makeup. The colors are awesome and the application stick easily to my skin with Paint Pot. These colors are so bold and fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only just received the eye shadow. At this point, I used the very light blue... Its sooooo pretty! It has a glittery shine! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> WORDS CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW WONDERFUL THIS PRODUCT IS!! The colors are SO vibrant and last all day and night!!! I have never had colors like this!! WORTH THE BUY AND THE PRICE!</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant, just a little &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, and the packaging was terrible.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE theses eyeshadows! True to what&#x27;s pictured!! Will order again! I literally where the gold daily!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and I am not kidding.  The jars come packed to the top and the colors pop so much.  Of course you need a base/primer.  The makeup is also not irritating to the skin, I have already purchased more from this company lol.</li>
    <li> The colors stay on so well and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it on. My favourite is the white because it&#x27;s great for every day.</li>
    <li> Perfectly pigmented with a medium.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just in love with these. There very vibrant and beautiful, I think ill use pigments more .</li>
    <li> I really love this makeup! Just like it said in the info you have to use a primer first for the best results. The only thing I was no happy with the way it smells. Yucky. Other than that it&#x27;s all beautifully high pigmented colors !</li>
    <li> I have not tried them yet, but am very excited. They look great! I am waiting on a primer before I try them first. I will try and post again after I use them. The shipping was very fast. So far, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>

    <li> I bought these eye shadow pots on a whim, and I was shocked at how awesome the colours were. They are ultra neon, which was exactly what I wanted, being that I was using them for a rave.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes glowed brightly under the blacklights, and I got a lot of compliments from the cool designs it created on my. My main suggestion is: make sure you have a primer for this product, if you don&#x27;t you will lose a lot of the pigment (I didn&#x27;t have this problem, but I use a great primer) (I recommend Urban Decay!). The colors are bright, and they are even more gorgeous in person. I highly recommend this product for a cool look!</li>
    <li> Bright colors really happy overall with this product can&#x27;t complain you need a base do so the pigments last longer</li>
    <li> I found the pigmentation strong and holding( (with the help of some LASplash eyeshadow sealer) !!! I now have to buy a set for my oldest daughter! Just to keep her from, five finger discounting mines!!!</li>
    <li> Love these shadows! They are vibrant and when used with a shadow primer they stand out even more. They almost seem to glow in the dark, react very well with black lights. Looks awesome with any eye color. Be careful with fall out though, the darker shades can cause a lot of fall out.</li>
    <li> OMG I&#x27;m soooooooo in love with these pigments they r truly amazing, lasts all day ( if u apply the primer as told of course ), and the colors r beautiful.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift, and it was a hit! My only issue was that the pink container was open and had gotten everywhere. Maybe a little tape on each would help in shipping.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very messy, not as bright as pictured but thats probably because I have an olive undertone instead of being Caucasian? Still beautiful, the colors arent exactly as pictured, there are 3 kinda powdery silvery colors.</li>
    <li> Pretty love them . .  Jus wish the jar was bigger with more product.</li>
    <li> These colors are bold and bright, of course you have to use a primer to get the full effect of them. At first I taught they were all matte colors but some have shimmer in them either they are still great for the price. I plan on buying more. :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these eyeshadows! To make the color really stick out, I put a little white eyeshadow (cream) on my eyelids. They looked amazing and I got compliments on them all day. I wish I could wear this stuff every day. Unfortunately, not very work appropriate</li>
    <li> its pretty good except a couple of colors don&#x27;t work as well as the others. (white, etc)  would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great bright colors that pop...</li>
    <li> These colors show up wonderfully. I dip my brush in water and then apply. It is beautiful. Everyone that loves fantasy colors should get these.</li>
    <li> When they arrived they were smaller than I expected. The packaging was okay. Very pigmented color a little goes a long way. In this set the teen really liked the bright colors. Very versatile pigments! Use them for polish and lipgloss as well as eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I do love this product..especially how potent all the colors are.  The only thing that uset me was that the Red isnt actually Red.. Its more orange red.  Considering that was the color I was buying them all for I was upset to waste my money. However, it is a great product so im sure ill find some use for it.</li>
    <li> Bright, brilliant colors.  Long-lasting!  A little bit goes a long ways.  I would highly recommend product and seller!  It was recommended to me by a friend.</li>
    <li> Shipping was perfect, as for the makeup maybe I am an amateur but it doesn&#x27;t spread well, it stains quickly. I will try it with a professional and see. Other than that it lasts!!!!!</li>
    <li> If your looking for bright colors order this product .&lt;br /&gt;But make sure if you dont want it super bright to mix it within lighter shades .&lt;br /&gt;5 stars .</li>
    <li> They are very beautiful thank you will order from here again the colors are very very good and they can also be used as lipstick ...</li>
    <li> Perfect just you get so little for the amount you pay the containers are so small. But all in all</li>
    <li> Love these little pigment pots! The colors are fabulous and the price is right. The packaging is a little pathetic (comes in pretty cheap pots and they are packaged in a ziploc bag) but regardless, I would definitely recommend to anyone who loves during fun and offbeat makeup!</li>
    <li> This goes on well, and looks very much like the picture. It doesn&#x27;t have to be name brand ladies. This issshhh rocks your world!!! Don&#x27;t be scared to be VIBRANT!!!</li>
    <li> i want more colors to match my work uniforms...pigment is really intense and easy to apply over a thin layer of hair gel mixed with a lil water</li>
    <li> The pigments are very bright and highly pigmented I can&#x27;t wait to use them. There&#x27;s only 3 shimmer colors, but that&#x27;s fine. I wanted to start using more matte shades anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing was ruined in the shipping. And it came with a card that is beautiful. Will be buying more in the future</li>
    <li> I bought these 10 Myo Brights Pigmented Eyeshadows first because of the reviews and second to fulfill my makeup kit and have pigment colors to experiment with I had never heard of this label until Amazon I was skeptical about them but LORD these eyeshadows are also underrated. First of all the packaging was Excellent and the shipping was sooooo fast. When I got them and seen them these colora look exactly the way they are displayed so bright. And lovely! And if you use contact solution they turn into eyeliners and are very very bright and intensed used with a lil water or fix plus. I absolutely love them so I ordered the other 3 color sets also. LUV LUV LUV This!</li>
    <li> Pigments can be skin safe without being eye safe - the eye is a different organ and has a mucus membrane that skin does not. Many neon pigments can cause irritation or permanent damage to vision. What if a bunch of fallout lands in my eye?</li>
    <li> These are so much lovelier in person than they are in the photo. Definitely need to buy a primer (preferably a white one) if you want them to pop, but even with a clear primer a few layers looks great. These are exactly what I wanted, and I will probably buy some of their other sets in the future.</li>
    <li> I received the products around 5 days after ordering which I found great.  used them today for the first time and found them amazing! I pack them on the lids for a pop of color when I wish to use them.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to mix with a mixing medium to use as eye liner or to use on your lids then i&#x27;d definitely recommend!  The color variety is impeccable as well. Only thing I foud weird is the small size of product. I was expecting something a bit larger. But they are amazing either way.</li>
    <li> Even with a MAC primer - the color didn&#x27;t transfer well. This was a powdery, weak, MESS. I also tried to apply it with a wet brush... still didn&#x27;t transfer well. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money. I&#x27;ll pay more for MAC products because they actually work, the color is TRUE, and it&#x27;s easier and quicker to apply.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for neon colors for a long time but never came close to finding anything as pigmented as these are.</li>
    <li> love it well pigmented its just all you need for bight colours came in a neat lil package and it was good to go i even found there personal website and they have lots of other items which i will be buyin in the futher love it all</li>
    <li> These shadows have some of the most pigmentation I&#x27;ve came across. They are messy and a bit difficult to keep up with but as far as results use a decent primer and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> this shadows are great and the colors are really true...for makeup artist or ppl that just want to experiment a new color</li>
    <li> These colors are for summer or spring. Very bright I love them. I wore it with glitter and I really rock the house!! Gotta love this..</li>
    <li> I was very shocked when i put this eye shadow on for the first time..I highly recommend this product..it was easy on my skin..Fabulous buy..</li>
    <li> i normally buy \\&quot;label\\&quot; cosmetics (urban decay, two-faced, ext.) but have been short on cash so i originally purchased these because of the price. but i will be purchasing them again because i fell in love with them the first time i used them. i bought the ultra bright, burning hearts, magical elixir and soul eyeshadow sets on monday (7/23) and they were here by wednesday (7/25)! i emailed the seller with a question and got a reply less than 5 minutes later, which in my experience is unheard of. the only downfall to these is that eye primer/base is a must in order for the brighter/lighter colors to show up. other than that, these are every bit as good as \\&quot;label\\&quot; cosmetics without the strain on my budget. i am in love!</li>
    <li> very pleased with each color being filled all the way up, If no primer used these colors will be very very light and hard to see, with a prime, yes they will have a some what of a pop, but you will need to apply several layers, and even doing this it was still not like I would have liked it, but when applied with a wet brush it goes on much better and shows off the pop more. Applying wet will give you more control over the amount of what I call powder fall out ( this is the power makeup that falls off the brush as u try and apply it. These seem to have a lot of fall out. I will try and press them to see if it helps with the fall out. Over all please and it was fun playing dress up with my girls, they loved the colors.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors. Did not have trouble blending them. If you are looking for glitter this product isnt for you because they are pretty much matte.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sis and she likes it very much. She has been using it on her clients and the effect is just like illustrated.</li>
    <li> These colors look amazing over a white base. They looked perfect for my photo shoot. I will buy again. Thanks</li>
    <li> These shadows are awesome! You definitely need a primer to use them or use them wet. The colors are rich and bright and fun! Because they are loose powder you do have to be careful or it gets everywhere but it&#x27;s worth it. They are so much brighter than any packed powder shadow I&#x27;ve used. If you are into bright colors, these are a must-have.</li>
    <li> I have never bought makeup from this company before, or that is not a department store brand.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the colors are indeed potent, however you do need a good primer before applying the shadows.  The packaging on the other hand was lacking.  It smelled like cigarettes, which is gross. I would return the product just for that reason alone, but don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money to ship it back. This is why I gave a rating of 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how messy it is but I like it being a powder. Powder is messy so its not the company&#x27;s fault. I love how bright the colors are, and you can mix them! They take practice to use but they are great colors and as bright as the picture shows them. This product is great.</li>
    <li> I bought these pigments to make different colors of nail polish.  They worked amazingly well.  The color is pure and vibrant.  You can&#x27;t beat the price. These are high quality pigments.</li>
    <li> While some of the colors are chalky, some of the others redeemed that one. I wore some of these for Halloween with my costume. With the flash of a camera you look like a clown.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter.  All I can say is, WOW.  They really are that bright.  She loves them.  You can see her coming a mile away.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it more ...but I&#x27;m in love with these pigments.. Bright, Bold, radiant.. I love love love love Love them.. I used the Orange and Blues in this carnival look.. I really wish that the seller can use Amazon Prime.. As they do take a long time to arrived,, also what I didn&#x27;t like, is the way some where stacked together, as they where a bit difficult to open,,,.. I preferred the single ones......must use an eye Primer NYX milk jumbo Pencil works well...and I jus placed another Oder to get ALL the other shades/colors...Get them guys.. As a professional mua.. I love them love love.. And do recommended them... AWESOME!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfull make up..Especially for belly dancers!</li>
    <li> im new to pigments but i must say i love myo pigments there true to the colors. nice and bright dont forget to use all forms of primer u can use these pigments for nail polish eye shadow and lip color</li>
    <li> All the colors are very beautiful!!! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the jars are too tiny they should be bigger to hold the eyeshadow better it kept spilling out as I was trying to put it on I bought bigger makeup jar containers instead and poured the eyeshadows in there that fixed the problem.</li>
    <li> These colors are a lot of fun, especially when you mix together colors you wouldn&#x27;t use and get colors you would.  Extra fine, don&#x27;t really like the chunky ones.  Love to wear the pinks and oranges over lipstick and it keeps the lipstick on your lips and not drinking rims.</li>
    <li> VERY BRIGHT COLORS. VIBRANT. LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> Very very pigmented even on African American skin. Soft, blendable, and fabulous. Just wish they were a bit larger. Good product, good seller.</li>
    <li> I was really suprised at the quality of this makeup. I do freelance makeup artistry and wanted some eyeshadows that were bright and neon for a photo shoot and they didn&#x27;t disappoint. You do need a lid primer for the colors to really pop, but the same can be said for any shadow really. You should always use a primer. I had never heard of this brand before and was a little skeptical, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I heard some of the reviewers complain that the jars were tiny...yes they are small....but the colors are so pigmented that you don&#x27;t need to use that much product for it to show up...so they should last a long long time. I&#x27;d definitely buy again. I went to the MYO website and they said they&#x27;d be doing contests and free giveaways which is cool. Definitely going to check that out.</li>
    <li> Colors are awesome and they glow in black light! Several of my friends have bought the product as well after seeing the eyeshadow on!</li>
    <li> very vibrant definitely needs primer but amazing colors</li>
    <li> truely bright,soooooooo happy i ordered this, i had been searching for that perfectly bright green, orange, and red. Finally my search is over. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who loves makeup. Truely impressive product</li>
    <li> The colors are great. Staying power is great. Color is buildable as well. I am Very happy I purchased this product!</li>
    <li> so bright hot colors.Jars are filled packed will last a long time.Very good price.i already told my coworkers now they are gonna order. thanks</li>
    <li> These are super bright and intense. I can&#x27;t wait to wear this to a rave with all my neon colored gear ^_^ You don&#x27;t need too much either, I dipped my brush in the lid and still got great color just from that! I really want my niece to try this :)</li>
    <li> The colors come on your face just as they look in the pots and I have a dark skin tone(african american). I used another brand base and it worked just fine. Definitely will be purchasing more colors. They last all day.</li>
    <li> These pigments are some of the best I&#x27;ve seen of their color and brightness, used over a base, they work perfect and come out true to the colors you see. I got these in hope that they would help me create bright neon color looks for rave makeup for my customers and it turned out better than I&#x27;d hoped for. Love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. People always think it&#x27;s sugar pill! Only problem is sometimes it does not adhere super evenly, and it is certainly very messy. But this level of pigmentation this price? YES.</li>
    <li> Very bright and great for costumes.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.These eyeshadows have great pigments. I loved the all the colors especially the yellow and blue. I am so happy with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> I Love all the colors and it looks really nice on, the only thing you must use a primer if you really want your color to POP! Overall this is a good eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Holy bright! im in love with these!!!!</li>
    <li> This was actually not for me. It was for my wife. I asked her and she said it was ok, but nothing great</li>
    <li> Amazing! They shipped super fast and they colors are spot on. Super bright and the neon colors seem to glow in the dark. Major plus!</li>
    <li> Not the best but not the worst. Fast shipping...expensive for what you get</li>
    <li> the colors are even brighter than they look online but that is what they wanted for there animakeup  so way to go.</li>
    <li> the colors are SO VIBRANT like even more then in the pictures. I wear my makeup crazy but this is a little extreme. its very hard to down play this &amp; it is very loose powder so much fall out &amp; the kicker is you have to cake it on &amp; if you dont your basically taking it all the way off just to try to get it on light &amp; it like is so powdery you you cant take off a lif without exploding on your hands counter clothes whatever. I really wish I liked this the colors are different unique &amp; i feel like they could be pretty its just way to difficult to apply &amp; when you can get it to look decent its still way to bright. not the sellers fault. shipping &amp; price were good</li>
    <li> these are sooooo pigmented and bright!  And not alone the price is outstanding for 10 of them!  I love them for the summer time also the fall but really the summer. I highly recommend these pigment eye shadows ....</li>
