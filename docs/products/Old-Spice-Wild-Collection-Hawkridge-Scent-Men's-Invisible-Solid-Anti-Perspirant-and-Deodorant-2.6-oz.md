      <li>and this smell does not fade away in a couple of hours like most.</li>
      <li>I love sniffing my husband&#x27;s pits when he wears this.</li>
      <li>On a side note my female cousin uses Wolfthorn which has more of berry smell but again not girly just awesome!</li>
      <li>Out of all of them my girlfriend likes this the most.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of FIJI, then you&#x27;ll def love this.</li>
      <li>really don&#x27;t understand how are there so many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>far as how it performs—they work great.  </li>
      <li>and I would imagine any guy who wants to smell good and not BO.</li>
      <li>Ok so I bought this thinking it would be as good as the old spice Fiji and wolfhorn</li>
      <li>Guys, if you&#x27;re looking for a great way to smell great and get a lot of attention, then look no further than this Old Spice Hawkridge deodorant.</li>
      <li>it does stay on all day, and I do like the texture, its really smooth</li>
      <li>I would enjoy smelling this on a man, too.</li>
      <li>This old spice smells good and shipped on time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very warm and slightly spicy (might be more of a winter scent), and it makes me want to eat my armpits.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably going to purchase the spray as well; I&#x27;ve never bought any of their sprays before, but this one is special.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not sickly</li>
      <li>Not to strong, Very masculine YET has some kind of note in it that complements the main smell &amp; cancels out the strong &amp;#34;Stick in your nose all day&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Best scented stuff I have ever used and lasts at least 24 hours against sweat and odor.  </li>
      <li>cloying sweet.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking to get this from a store (which most people would probably do for deodorant anyways), be sure to pounce fast, because these can go quick with how much people like these scents.  </li>
      <li>Just like clean fresh sweet and the smell lasts all freaking day and night.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as the gel old spices but still good</li>
      <li>Almost a spicy musky scent, but still mild.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to exactly describe the smell, but I would say I feel as free as a bird when I put it on.  </li>
      <li>sweet and spicy but not overly powerful.</li>
      <li>so once you find the kind you like, sit back and let Amazon deliver man-smelling-stuff right to your front door!</li>
      <li>I knew Old Spice has always made good smelling deodorant and other men&#x27;s health products, but this new wild collection of theirs has impressed me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Works great as an AP, I trim my pit hair so I can use less of it and helps with smell/sweating too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There was a Degree teen deodorant called sweet revolution that smelled amazing</li>
      <li>It also does a good job of keeping me dry.  </li>
      <li>I thought that smelled pretty good, so my next move was to get myself some of that in antiperspirant/deodorant as well as body spray.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed the deodorant-only type doesn’t have quite the same smell (and doesn’t smell as nice) as the antiperspirant/deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Hawkridge is masculine in a very sweet, mellow way.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that they are not always available where I normally shop</li>
      <li>I have noticed that they are not always available where I normally shop</li>
      <li>It is: mild, sweet, ginseng, candy yet masculine.  </li>
      <li>Belize, Matterhorn, classic, etc are better Old Spice scents than this one</li>
      <li>When he first started, I&#x27;d get a whif of it and be like</li>
      <li>that no mere mortal woman can resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very pleasing!</li>
      <li>When I first saw that my brother got the Hawkridge scent in a body wash, I knew I had to try it out.  </li>
      <li>I WILL eventually work through all these scents or perhaps find them in a store to smell first.</li>
      <li>When I’m getting ready in the morning, I find myself asking myself (err, Austin Powers!), “What do I feel like today?  </li>
      <li>I love the new line of Old Spice antiperspirant/deodorants, and Hawkridge, Bearglove, and Wolfthorn are some of my favorites.  </li>
      <li>Definitely my favorite of the new Old Spice lines.</li>
      <li>Hawkridge is a refreshing blast of manly freedom that inhabits your very being with a sheer visage of power</li>
      <li>It smells good when mixed with the body spray and lasts pretty long.</li>
      <li>The aroma is slightly sweet, yet masculine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what about it that gives me good luck on things</li>
      <li>The anti-antiperspirant lasts throughout an intense two hour workout and left my armpits both dry and still smelling surprisingly pleasant.</li>
      <li>I started wearing the deodorant-only version, which is different, but also a new favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very unisex to me...</li>
      <li>If you’re a dude like me, you probably never gave much thought to what you were smearing on your armpit—</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve smelled the other products in this scent and they smell more like the deordorant than this AP.</li>
      <li>People are always blown away that the smell is Old Spice, I have even had people ask me for the exact name of the smell so they can pick some up.</li>
      <li>however im sure there arent too many girls that want their man smelling like a baby, but I could be wrong.</li>
      <li>The last Dove deodorant I used smelled okay, but it didn&#x27;t work well enough</li>
      <li>I love the fact that the smell lasts all day unlike some of the other old spices scents I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>My favorite, I get complements everyday about how I smell.</li>
      <li>They all have a distinct enough aroma that’ll make you pause and give thought to what sort of man-animal you want to smell like for the day.  </li>
      <li>Looks like I found a new deodorant.</li>
      <li>(OK, I’m joking—I have socks on, too) and this Old Spice stuff keeps me dry and smelling un-offensive all day long.  </li>
      <li>With how much I have enjoyed the Hawkridge scent, I may just have to spring for some of their other scents in the wild collection like Foxcrest, and these other new ones that I just saw for the first time recently, Lionpride and Bearglove, just to try them out sometime.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it was the Old Spice commercials, maybe it was the Old Spice packaging, or maybe it was just the fact that these were stocked on the shelves at my eye-level</li>
      <li>Getting X-Mas knocked out early, Bought deodorant as Hubby&#x27;s stalking stuffer things.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> it smells like baby powder, so if you like that smell then great, but i&#x27;m not a fan. it does stay on all day, and I do like the texture, its really smooth, thats what earned the 4 stars. i was pretty disappointed by the smell though. I read somewhere that girl usually associate the smell of baby powder as a clean smell while men associate it with dirty, like a dirty diaper. however im sure there arent too many girls that want their man smelling like a baby, but I could be wrong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl and usually wear cologne instead of perfume because they are way too flowery and stripper coconut cherry like (thank you Victorias Secret for that). There was a Degree teen deodorant called sweet revolution that smelled amazing and this is the guy version of that! It&#x27;s sweet but not sickly cloying sweet. Just like clean fresh sweet and the smell lasts all freaking day and night. I&#x27;ve smelled the other products in this scent and they smell more like the deordorant than this AP. This smells great on me and I would imagine any guy who wants to smell good and not BO. On a side note my female cousin uses Wolfthorn which has more of berry smell but again not girly just awesome!</li>
    <li> I love the new line of Old Spice antiperspirant/deodorants, and Hawkridge, Bearglove, and Wolfthorn are some of my favorites.  If you’re a dude like me, you probably never gave much thought to what you were smearing on your armpit—you’d just stroll down the men’s care aisle and look for the antiperspirant/deodorant that had the coolest packaging with some sort of name like “SPORT EXTREME XXL MAGNUM BLASTER”.  Maybe it was the Old Spice commercials, maybe it was the Old Spice packaging, or maybe it was just the fact that these were stocked on the shelves at my eye-level and I didn’t have to bend over to read the label, but I picked up one of these and gave it a smell—wow.  I’m not going to even try to explain what it smells like, because I would do a horrible job at it, but suffice to say it just smells good.  It’s one of those things that you just have to smell for yourself.  I will say that my girlfriend has complimented on how good I smell, and since I don’t wear cologne, I owe it all to the sweet aroma being exuded from my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy yourself one of each.  When I’m getting ready in the morning, I find myself asking myself (err, Austin Powers!), “What do I feel like today?  Bearglove?  Wolfthorn? Hawkridge?”  They all have a distinct enough aroma that’ll make you pause and give thought to what sort of man-animal you want to smell like for the day.  Although, I imagine if I bumped into a bear in the woods he probably wouldn’t smell anything like my deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it performs—they work great.  I “perspire” a lot.  Heck, I’m sitting at Everest base camp right now wearing nothing but boxers in a chair made of snowballs and I have a little sweat on my forehead (OK, I’m joking—I have socks on, too) and this Old Spice stuff keeps me dry and smelling un-offensive all day long.  I always use the antiperspirant/deodorant combo, the ones with the silver-colored caps—the red colored caps are just deodorant.  I have noticed the deodorant-only type doesn’t have quite the same smell (and doesn’t smell as nice) as the antiperspirant/deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you’re shopping, give these a try.  I have noticed that they are not always available where I normally shop so once you find the kind you like, sit back and let Amazon deliver man-smelling-stuff right to your front door!t deodorant.

    <li> Everyone in my household wears this scent--male and female. It is the best OS antiperspirant/deodorant ever made. I love sniffing my husband&#x27;s pits when he wears this. When he first started, I&#x27;d get a whif of it and be like, what is that? You smell so good! I started wearing the deodorant-only version, which is different, but also a new favorite.</li>
    <li> Getting X-Mas knocked out early, Bought deodorant as Hubby&#x27;s stalking stuffer things. GREAT SMELL! Never tried before, went off of reviews everywhere to decide on a scent &amp; i read where a guy said his girlfriend liked it, so...i got it &amp; yes....IT is a nice scent! Not to strong, Very masculine YET has some kind of note in it that complements the main smell &amp; cancels out the strong &amp;#34;Stick in your nose all day&amp;#34; smell! Very pleasing! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is NOT a faint smell...It is the same strength as ANY body spray but it don&#x27;t burn. Something i would expect from a more expensive cologne! RECOMMEND! I WILL eventually work through all these scents or perhaps find them in a store to smell first. BUT THESE ARE NOT EASY to find in stores. Sell out VERY QUICKLY so buy here! Cheaper anyways!</li>
    <li> Leaning towards fruity. Belize, Matterhorn, classic, etc are better Old Spice scents than this one</li>
    <li> The scent contains hints of licorice and maybe even a dash of ginger. The aroma is slightly sweet, yet masculine. The anti-antiperspirant lasts throughout an intense two hour workout and left my armpits both dry and still smelling surprisingly pleasant. Definitely my favorite of the new Old Spice lines. It&#x27;s also received compliments from the lady friends.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a girl, but pretty much all women&#x27;s deodorant smells AWFUL. And sometimes I want to smell manly. Ya know, when I have to split firewood or whatever.    For the past couple years I&#x27;ve been using Ban&#x27;s Vanilla Twist and I was all about that s***. I didn&#x27;t smell like a man, but I didn&#x27;t smell like your grandma&#x27;s face cream either. When it was discontinued, I made it my mission to find something that I didn&#x27;t mind smelling all day every day. I think this is it.    Hawkridge is masculine in a very sweet, mellow way. I wouldn&#x27;t call it unisex, but I think it works for girls who don&#x27;t want to smell like flowers. It&#x27;s very warm and slightly spicy (might be more of a winter scent), and it makes me want to eat my armpits.    If I met a guy who was wearing this deodorant, I would high five him for wearing the same deodorant (obviously) but I would also consider making out with him because it&#x27;s a very sexy scent.</li>
    <li> My son loves it - it smells good, seems to work well (no body odor), and he uses it with the body spray to layer the scent - very nice!</li>
    <li> Nice and refreshing for men and remind me of men going to sea and my Dad used it all the time.</li>
    <li> I like a good smelling AP. I don&#x27;t smell BAD, but I don&#x27;t ever want to smell bad as I sit around good looking women all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is almost like a cologne/AP. I have gotten a ton of complements on it. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite and much less common than other old spice scents and axe/tag/whatever. I can never find it in stores though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great as an AP, I trim my pit hair so I can use less of it and helps with smell/sweating too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prevent pit stains, always add a small amount of oxyclean to all your shirt laundry. If you don&#x27;t it will build up and ruin your shirts.</li>
    <li> Hawkridge is a refreshing blast of manly freedom that inhabits your very being with a sheer visage of power that no mere mortal woman can resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it has an agreeable aroma that will last all day while doing varied and interesting manly adventures in this wild and dangerous plane of existence that we call the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use the power wisely.</li>
    <li> As a soldier serving overseas it&#x27;s not as easy to find the little things I&#x27;m accustomed to when I&#x27;m back home. Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save Store gives me access and helps me save money on the products that help me feel at home even when I&#x27;m halfway across the globe. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This old spice smells good and shipped on time I don&#x27;t like it as much as the gel old spices but still good</li>
    <li> Ok so I bought this thinking it would be as good as the old spice Fiji and wolfhorn but I was wrong. I almost never leave bad reviews but the scent is horrible. It smells like very strong moth repellent.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t understand how are there so many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying that old spice is horrible, what I am saying the scent is.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to old spice Fiji and wolfhorn.</li>
    <li> This is more of my evening smell. It smells good when mixed with the body spray and lasts pretty long. Love it!.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible. It does its job as an antiperspirant pretty damn well, but that&#x27;s not the best part. This stuff smells amazing and the smell stays around all day. I apply it to my underarms​ and maybe a little on my chest if it&#x27;s going to be an exceptionally hot day. People are always blown away that the smell is Old Spice, I have even had people ask me for the exact name of the smell so they can pick some up.</li>
    <li> Great price and smell, now the bitches are all over me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a gal who&#x27;s picky about scents. I just don&#x27;t like a lot of commonly available women&#x27;s products because they either smell like obnoxious fruit, fake flowers, or cheap hookers (and sometimes even cheap hookers eating obnoxious fruit and carrying fake flowers). The last Dove deodorant I used smelled okay, but it didn&#x27;t work well enough and I was sweaty by the end of the day. I decided to go through all the available Old Spice scents to see if anything was appealing, and this is perfect. It&#x27;s very unisex to me...sweet and spicy but not overly powerful. I would enjoy smelling this on a man, too. Works well. Looks like I found a new deodorant.</li>
    <li> I kid you not, this is some of the best deodorant I have ever used.  I knew Old Spice has always made good smelling deodorant and other men&#x27;s health products, but this new wild collection of theirs has impressed me.  When I first saw that my brother got the Hawkridge scent in a body wash, I knew I had to try it out.  I thought that smelled pretty good, so my next move was to get myself some of that in antiperspirant/deodorant as well as body spray.  Best decision I&#x27;ve ever made.  I don&#x27;t know how to exactly describe the smell, but I would say I feel as free as a bird when I put it on.  If you&#x27;re looking to get this from a store (which most people would probably do for deodorant anyways), be sure to pounce fast, because these can go quick with how much people like these scents.  With how much I have enjoyed the Hawkridge scent, I may just have to spring for some of their other scents in the wild collection like Foxcrest, and these other new ones that I just saw for the first time recently, Lionpride and Bearglove, just to try them out sometime.  Don&#x27;t just take it from me though.  Guys, if you&#x27;re looking for a great way to smell great and get a lot of attention, then look no further than this Old Spice Hawkridge deodorant.</li>
    <li> I chose it because Its very good and durable. Fragrancy is a little bit sweet , realy good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, good size to take with you to places,overall a good product and shipped within the standard time limit</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff (smell is very opinionated) if women use it all the power to you but i have work days i have to sweat through and this smell does not fade away in a couple of hours like most. (if guys are looking at you weird just wink they&#x27;ll have no idea what to do). honestly i think this fragrance could work for either sex all depends on your attitude.</li>
    <li> Best scented stuff I have ever used and lasts at least 24 hours against sweat and odor.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like a bar or basketball player.  It is: mild, sweet, ginseng, candy yet masculine.  Had multiple compliments from..classmates.</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell.  Almost a spicy musky scent, but still mild.  It also does a good job of keeping me dry.  I am a sweater and this deodorant is up to the task.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used after hours, swagger, champion and here&#x27;s another one! Out of all of them my girlfriend likes this the most. They better keep this scent! I&#x27;m actually thinking about getting the spray too (never thought about any of the other scents)</li>
    <li> My favorite, I get complements everyday about how I smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what about it that gives me good luck on things but this scent gives me good luck every time I wear it!! I love the fact that the smell lasts all day unlike some of the other old spices scents I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is some seriously good stuff! If you&#x27;re a fan of FIJI, then you&#x27;ll def love this. It&#x27;s a bit sweeter and stronger than FIJI. I&#x27;m probably going to purchase the spray as well; I&#x27;ve never bought any of their sprays before, but this one is special. (Note): Make sure you don&#x27;t accidentally get the one without anti-perspirant; don&#x27;t get the red-topped one.</li>
