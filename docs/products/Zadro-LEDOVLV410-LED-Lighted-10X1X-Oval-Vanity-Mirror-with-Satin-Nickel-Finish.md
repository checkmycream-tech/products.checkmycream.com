      <li>I LOVE MY MIRROR, IT LOOKS GOOD AND</li>
      <li>AC adaptor is a nice feature.  </li>
      <li>It can be located anywhere and is very easy to install since it can work on batteries alone or with the included AC adapter if an outlet is within about two or three feet.      </li>
      <li>I told the company and they provided quick and very kind service sent another unit.</li>
      <li>The light is sufficient for close inspections, yet not too bright as to create glare</li>

      <li>and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
      <li>It is a fantastic mirror!  </li>
      <li>WOULD LOVE</li>
      <li>I found a mirror for $8 at Ross that was better quality (</li>
      <li>Service is top notch</li>
      <li>I read many of the reviews.  </li>
      <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t totally pleased.  </li>
      <li>Love the 10X magnification.</li>
      <li>I love the strong magnifier.</li>
      <li>A nice plus is that the light switch is also dimmer so you can adjust the light intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both mirrors are clear and distortion free and the cool LED lighting is perfect for close-up work, which is a good thing, because the 10X side will bring you very close indeed to the mirror.  </li>
      <li>The light was nice and bright and the 1X side was very clear however...</li>
      <li>light around this mirror is very good and continuous - you can&#x27;t discern any individual lights.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Luckily I was able to return to the seller for a full refund.  </li>
      <li>The light is not as bright as I would like and not as bright as other Zadro lights.</li>
      <li>I replaced the switch and soldered all wires, all is working fine now.  </li>
      <li>I had wanted a lighted mirror and this seemed to fit the bill</li>
      <li>It is larger than I thought it would be and of great quality.</li>
      <li>The battery housing (4 C batteries, not included) doesn&#x27;t fit together well, and wires the connect</li>
      <li>This is the clearest mirror with the brightest light  </li>
      <li>The magnified mirror is great and took a minor eye adjustment.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying that I love the look of this mirror; the size and finish is exactly what I was looking for.     </li>
      <li>Two features of this mirror stood out during my research - light brightness and mirror magnification - and those proved true.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never had a lighted one before, but thought it&#x27;d be nice to have it lighted since I was getting a new one.  </li>
      <li>Very streamlined and elegant.</li>
      <li>The cordless feature is perfect for taking into other rooms for natural light.</li>
      <li>Would return it, but honestly it&#x27;s too much of a hassle with their return policy, aside from the fact that I can&#x27;t lug around the large box</li>
      <li>The switch that turns the light on and off is completely severed from the wires inside, meaning that the light is no longer functional.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s taller than my last one, which is nice.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly as picture and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This mirror has made simple and far more effective this very laborious effort.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find that the light really helps me much.  </li>
      <li>Purchase this mirror for the exterior quality and features, but be ready to fix wires on the inside!</li>
      <li>they are not as interested in the quality of their product as they were before.</li>
      <li>The first unit I received was not acceptable.</li>
      <li>Better yet, unlike mirrors that use incandescent lamps or flourescent tubes, this one doesn&#x27;t get hot when it has been left on for a while.</li>
      <li>For what I paid, I wish the overall quality was more consistent.</li>
      <li>I called customer service and was told that only Duracell batteries give full light.  </li>
      <li>The light did not work on the first one I ordered, so I exchanged it in the second one works.</li>
      <li>I loved this mirror when I first got it, but the swivel feature was VERY stiff, and it eventually caused something to break within the housing which then caused the mirror to crack and finally caused the light itself to stop working.</li>
      <li>The light color is almost identical to those mirrors that use a fluorescent tube - daylight quality - not dingy yellow.</li>
      <li>After much research, I purchased this as a Christmas gift.  </li>
      <li>This mirror is everything I expected and more.</li>
      <li>The mirror is lighted, and I find I really want my face lighted.     </li>
      <li>Too much magnification.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this mirror!  </li>
      <li>Attempts to turn the light on caused all internal wires to break.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much for the product.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to use this mirror and wanted to keep it.  </li>
      <li>The arms are nice and stiff, not flimsy.</li>
      <li>Item arrived intact, but the light switch was loose.  </li>
      <li>In the end, I compromised a little bit of brightness for the height and cordless features, and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>I live it💝💝💝💝💝</li>
      <li>This sounded ridiculous, but sure enough, they were right!  </li>
      <li>The light is not nature, the mirror itself is not anywhere near the quality of the Simple Human mirror motion cordless mirror.  </li>
      <li>My wife has wanted a lighted mirror on the wall near her sink in our bathroom for quite some time.</li>
      <li>Even the outside areas of my eyebrows are a real stretch for the magnified side.  </li>
      <li>I really should have sent it back.    </li>
      <li>The LEDs are dim</li>
      <li>The 1X side was perfectly flat but the 10X side was convex..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, here is the product to score me some major points -</li>
      <li>Obviously this mirror does not withstand even a year of normal use (using it once daily).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nice mirror. Perfect height</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I love the look of this mirror; the size and finish is exactly what I was looking for.     The problem is that the workmanship is questionable. 1) The arm does not swing freely and is VERY stiff; it takes both hands to move it, and 2) every time I flip the mirror from one side to the other, a little piece of plastic/silicone rattles around loose. Clearly, no one tested this unit before it was packaged for sale. For what I paid, I wish the overall quality was more consistent. Would return it, but honestly it&#x27;s too much of a hassle with their return policy, aside from the fact that I can&#x27;t lug around the large box it came in.     This may have been fluke, but it was my experience.</li>
    <li> My wife has wanted a lighted mirror on the wall near her sink in our bathroom for quite some time. Unfortunately there is no AC power plug anywhere close to where she wants it mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, here is the product to score me some major points - a battery operated LED lit wall mounted mirror! Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light around this mirror is very good and continuous - you can&#x27;t discern any individual lights. You would think that there is a fluorescent tube in it. The light color is almost identical to those mirrors that use a fluorescent tube - daylight quality - not dingy yellow. Better yet, unlike mirrors that use incandescent lamps or flourescent tubes, this one doesn&#x27;t get hot when it has been left on for a while. A nice plus is that the light switch is also dimmer so you can adjust the light intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit requires 4 &#x27;C&#x27; batteries and also comes with an AC power adapter in case you have a plug nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was very simple - it has a well designed mounting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all - my wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Item arrived intact, but the light switch was loose.  Attempts to turn the light on caused all internal wires to break.  I attempted to tighten it to no avail.  I replaced the switch and soldered all wires, all is working fine now.  QA on switch was not up to standard.  Overall, wife likes mirror.</li>
    <li> I needed a wireless mirror and was disappointed when the lighting was very dim.  I called customer service and was told that only Duracell batteries give full light.  This sounded ridiculous, but sure enough, they were right!  With the Duracells it is terrific.</li>
    <li> It is fabulous, cordless and arrived perfectly packaged! I live it💝💝💝💝💝</li>
    <li> This mirror is everything I expected and more. It is larger than I thought it would be and of great quality. The arms are nice and stiff, not flimsy. I can now apply my make-up and have perfect eyes! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had this installed in October of 2010.  I find that the magnified side has a very narrow focus.  Basically I can look at my nose, forehead, chin, and maybe an inch on either side of these. Trying to focus on the side of the face or the ear just doesn&#x27;t work.  Even the outside areas of my eyebrows are a real stretch for the magnified side.  It could be that the 10x does that.  The ones I&#x27;ve had before were 7x and 5x.    I had wanted a lighted mirror and this seemed to fit the bill well. I&#x27;d never had a lighted one before, but thought it&#x27;d be nice to have it lighted since I was getting a new one.  I don&#x27;t find that the light really helps me much.  The mirror is lighted, and I find I really want my face lighted.     I agree with the previous reviewer that the arms are very stiff.  I don&#x27;t have the problem with something rattling when I flip the mirror.  However, the mirror casing is quite thick - about an inch compared with my previous ones that that had been 3/8 in. and 1/2 in. wide.  I suspect the extra width is to house the led lights.    So I&#x27;ve not been happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The first unit I received was not acceptable. I told the company and they provided quick and very kind service sent another unit. it works great.. Service is top notch</li>
    <li> After much research, I purchased this as a Christmas gift.  Two features of this mirror stood out during my research - light brightness and mirror magnification - and those proved true.  Reviewers for other lighted mirrors complained of dim lighting and questionable build quality.  Not for this one!  The LED lighting is more than sufficient (too bad it&#x27;s not dimmable), the mirrors are of high quality, and the long arms are well made (if a little too stiff).  And the ability to run this using batteries or with an (included) AC adaptor is a nice feature.  However, I wasn&#x27;t totally pleased.  Inside the base is the electronic guts, and the manufacturer really built this thing on the cheap.  The battery housing (4 C batteries, not included) doesn&#x27;t fit together well, and wires the connect everything together are fragile (I&#x27;m being very nice here).  Three of the wires broke while I was installing the battery pack in the base.  I should have replaced them all while I was resoldering them, but I chose not to.  Hopefully, I won&#x27;t regret that decision...  I really should have sent it back.    To summarize: Purchase this mirror for the exterior quality and features, but be ready to fix wires on the inside!</li>
    <li> I suffer from pseudofolliculitis barbae or ingrown facial hair.  This requires having to pluck individual hairs from my face on a regular basis.  This mirror has made simple and far more effective this very laborious effort.  Thank you so much for the product.  It is a fantastic mirror!  Great shipping too.</li>
    <li> The mirror is well designed but I found the focus depth of the magnifying side requires you to be way too close to the mirror for things like shaving (men). My fiancée us very happy with it for makeup, etc. but I would have preferred a loner focus length to allow me to be a bit further back.</li>
    <li> This mirror was everything I expected! Perfect magnification and love the option of battery power or the use on an outlet!!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. She says perfect height on dresser and light works good.</li>
    <li> The light was nice and bright and the 1X side was very clear however...the 10X side was distorted. You couldn&#x27;t actually make out facial features until you were within 3-4&amp;#34; which defeats the purpose of magnification. A woman wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply makeup that close up. The 1X side was perfectly flat but the 10X side was convex..not sure if that is normal but it seemed strange. The construction seemed durable but battery compartment was a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with mirror. The light is not nature, the mirror itself is not anywhere near the quality of the Simple Human mirror motion cordless mirror.  The only reason I purchased was that this mirror was x10 and theSimple Human mirror is x5.  The Simple Human mirror x5 is twice the price of this mirror but don&#x27;t waste the money on this mirror, wait for the Simple Human company to pay attn to what people want and makes a x10 cordless make up mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great magnifying mirror.  Bought it for my wife to do her make-up and she loves it.  It can be located anywhere and is very easy to install since it can work on batteries alone or with the included AC adapter if an outlet is within about two or three feet.      Both mirrors are clear and distortion free and the cool LED lighting is perfect for close-up work, which is a good thing, because the 10X side will bring you very close indeed to the mirror.  At this magnification your nose and a small amount of surrounding tissue will fill the entire view!</li>
    <li> This mirror is a quality mirror, however I returned it because I did not like the 10x magnification.  I need an 8x magnification, so I&#x27;m shopping for another.</li>
    <li> This is the clearest mirror with the brightest light  It provides close to daylight lighting at nighttime.  My mirror did fall out. I contacted Zadro and they immediately provided a replacement mirror.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lighted make up mirror.  Lightweight and looks very nice on a dresser or vanity.  I did know that it was oval shaped and my only wish is that it was a bit wider by an inch or so.  It came on time as promised, and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Zooms in well, can find a needle in a hay stack.  The light is sufficient for close inspections, yet not too bright as to create glare</li>
    <li> When I picked this out I read many of the reviews.  I was hesitant based on some of the feedback and I should have listened to my gut.  This mirror is very cheaply designed.  Mine broke after one day, so it is going back.  Poor quality.  If there were a \\&quot;zero\\&quot; star rating, I would have given it that.  Especially for how expensive it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Zadro&#x27;s over the years. Sadly, their quality has declined. The plastic battery cover falls out of this one even without batteries installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oval ones are now engraved with their logo and although it&#x27;s in front, it does not even align with the mirror. Not a big deal but it&#x27;s noticeable and a sign to me they are not as interested in the quality of their product as they were before. It&#x27;s those little things that should not be an issue at the price.</li>
    <li> I just received this last week and I absolutely LOVE it. The cordless feature is perfect for taking into other rooms for natural light. It&#x27;s taller than my last one, which is nice. Very streamlined and elegant.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  The mirror is such poor quality you can&#x27;t focus on anything.  The LEDs are dim so it&#x27;s hard to see yourself.  The field of vision is very narrow so you can only use one eye to view your face.  Then to top things off, when I returned it I had to pay for postage, which in this case was $18.00.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MIRROR.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great height, and I love that it&#x27;s cordless. The light did not work on the first one I ordered, so I exchanged it in the second one works. The light is not as bright as I would like and not as bright as other Zadro lights. It is, however, brighter than some other brand lighted mirrors that I have tried. In the end, I compromised a little bit of brightness for the height and cordless features, and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror a year ago, at Christmas 2012. Within 10 months it is broken. The switch that turns the light on and off is completely severed from the wires inside, meaning that the light is no longer functional. Obviously this mirror does not withstand even a year of normal use (using it once daily). Absolutely do not buy!</li>
    <li> a little difficult to mount. joints should have been lubricated,very hard to move with out. some people would not know to oil</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY MIRROR, IT LOOKS GOOD AND ANYONE THAT HAS POOR VISION WOULD LOVE USING THIS PRODUCT, GETS YOU UP CLOSE.</li>
    <li> I loved this mirror when I first got it, but the swivel feature was VERY stiff, and it eventually caused something to break within the housing which then caused the mirror to crack and finally caused the light itself to stop working. Very poor quality construction for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the height and finish.  I wish the mirror was round.  The oval shape makes it more difficult to see.  I have to close one eye to use it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife.  She likes it.  It provided two magnifications and very good led lighting.</li>
    <li> Too much magnification.  Ordered the 5X Mag to replace this one.</li>
    <li> Best makeup mirror ever.  Love the 10X magnification.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this mirror!  I mean, it was NOT cheap.  And Zadro seemed to be a good brand.  I was disappointed when my mirror arrived broken.  The plastic base was EXTREMELY cheap!  Thin plastic that was prone to breaking.  The rest of the mirror seemed to be good quality so I don&#x27;t know why they skimped out on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I was able to return to the seller for a full refund.  It did take a while to get my shipping label and money back.  They offered to replace it but I felt it was poor construction.  I really wanted to use this mirror and wanted to keep it.  But Zadro needs to fix that feature.  I found a mirror for $8 at Ross that was better quality (sans light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still on the search for the perfect lighted mirror!</li>
    <li> Mirror runs on batteries as well as electricity.  It has a nice brushed polish finish and is the perfect size.  The magnified mirror is great and took a minor eye adjustment. The item was exactly as picture and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This was on her Christmas list and she liked everything about it; size, looks, and function.</li>
    <li> Only had it for a week. Looked beautiful, light was perfect, returned because I realized I didn&#x27;t want an oval mirror.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!  Lighting works great with or without the plug. So convenient. Beautiful shape. Not too heavy to lift. I love the strong magnifier. Helps immensely with makeup application.</li>
