      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The powder is light,  but has great coverage for freckles, blemishes, sunspots, etc.  </li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how I managed before discovering this brand of makeup.</li>
      <li>But a really good powder,  best I have found so far.  </li>
      <li>I am so thrilled to see that it was here.</li>
      <li>It is light, but covers my fair skin well.</li>

      <li>I am ordering more today.</li>
      <li>I love this powder.</li>
      <li>my favorite powder...</li>
      <li>Now I feel confident throughout the day.</li>
      <li>for this pressed powder it works okay for me , by itself or even over my foundation .</li>
      <li>I love this makeup</li>
      <li>:) This tone was perfect for me, I have olive skin tone, so Natural Beige was the right one.</li>
      <li>I got this today and was so excited to try it out!</li>
      <li>This is such a great powder.</li>
      <li>because the sponge goes in the mirror side, not the makeup side, this is a fabulous product.  </li>
      <li>and that is almost too light if I have been out in the sun a bit.  </li>
      <li>I am very picky when it comes to powder foundation and when I found this one I thought I hit jackpot!!!</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Would be great if this came in a loose powder.</li>
      <li>Thanks for selling such an amazing product at such a great price:-)</li>
      <li>I just love this product, I really wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it.  </li>
      <li>Works nicely &amp; is pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>It still looks fine on my face, but it doesn&#x27;t really match my skin tone.</li>
      <li>It coves age spot pretty well.</li>
      <li>I also use Infallible never fail makeup foundation ( liquid ).</li>
      <li>iI recommend this one for sensitive skin look like me,the price is cheap ....</li>
      <li>This powder truly never fails.</li>
      <li>When it first arrived I was a bit concerned.</li>
      <li>I love this formula and I cannot find it in local stores any longer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had several of these and the case always separates from top and bottom.  </li>
      <li>It looks natural and feels smooth on face.</li>
      <li>To compare with all other same products this one is the best for me so far.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s really my fault for ordering this one.</li>
      <li>The container was very beat up, much of the writing rubbed off.</li>
      <li>Flawless without being heavy and the price is much better than the more expensive powder foundations I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
      <li>I literally have little to no time to freshen up, and L&#x27;Oreal Infallible has been the solution to my years-long dilemma of hoping/worrying if I look &#x27;okay&#x27;</li>
      <li>And if you get the included sponge a little damp it gives even more coverage.  </li>
      <li>This is a new must have for me.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have with it is that the product lasts much longer than the case itself.  </li>
      <li>I like a natural, but somewhat polished look</li>
      <li>And it really does last for hours and hours.  </li>
      <li>It goes on like powder but gives you almost as much coverage as regular foundation.  </li>
      <li>I was concerned that it was old product.</li>
      <li>Loreal Infallible Powder is lasting, makes your skin look very natural</li>
      <li>On the other hand, this stayed on for a long nap, so at least it stays on for a good 4 hours while being smudged a smeared around.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty white, so this powder was just a bit too dark.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m pretty white, so this powder was just a bit too dark.</li>
<li> So far it has never really caused much of a problem as far as a mess in my purse or anything, but it is kind of annoying.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s  SPF 20, but I don&#x27;t really pack on the powder very heavily</li>
<li> Complete coverage and long lasting without feeling heavy or caked on.</li>
<li> Stays on a long time but not 16 or 18 hours.</li>
<li> But besides that, and a little bit of getting used to the way you have to apply powder, flip back to mirror, flip back to powder etc.</li>
<li> Does last longer than other foundations or lipstick.</li>
<li> I have been using the brand for a year and even though I try other brands, I continue to come back to this one.</li>
<li> Makes my skin feel too dry.  </li>
<li> the power is dry but still applies like cream.  </li>
<li> I consider myself a low-fuss sort of person, and the nature of my slightly chaotic job has me zipping from meeting room to meeting room, presenting in front of multiple groups of people throuout the day.</li>
<li> I suffer from Rosacea and it is one of the few products that actually works for me.</li>
<li> ,The product is like i expected, thank&#x27;s</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different powders and this one is alright, but I don&#x27;t think that I would buy this again when I use it up.  </li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t make you look extremely powdery or cakey.</li>
<li> Sometimes the compact is hard to open though</li>
<li> Lasts all day and even in the morning it&#x27;s still on and just needs a slight touch up.</li>
<li> but I find it a bit hard to get some of it on the round sponge it comes with .</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t carry it around due to the broken plastic piece that won&#x27;t allow the cover to stay shut, but I can use it before I go out...</li>
<li> Getting the correct color tones is a bit hard of course</li>
<li> but I have a bad case of Rosacea and do like to be presentable when in public .</li>
<li> I was so disappointed to see that the stores discontinued</li>

    <li> I love this powder. It&#x27;s great over moisturizer alone without foundation. Keeps the shine away for hours! I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Yes, I am a guy but I have a bad case of Rosacea and do like to be presentable when in public . I also use Infallible never fail makeup foundation ( liquid ). Getting the correct color tones is a bit hard of course as I see a lot of you ladies have the same problem too .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this pressed powder it works okay for me , by itself or even over my foundation . Lasts all day and even in the morning it&#x27;s still on and just needs a slight touch up. I know it&#x27;s pressed powder but I find it a bit hard to get some of it on the round sponge it comes with . Would be great if this came in a loose powder.</li>
    <li> When it first arrived I was a bit concerned. The container was very beat up, much of the writing rubbed off. I was concerned that it was old product. For the price I said what the heck, I will try it. I was not disappointed. This stuff is great. Complete coverage and long lasting without feeling heavy or caked on. I suffer from Rosacea and it is one of the few products that actually works for me. I am ordering more today.</li>
    <li> I just love this product, I really wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it.  Thankfully, I can always find it on Amazon.  It goes on like powder but gives you almost as much coverage as regular foundation.  And if you get the included sponge a little damp it gives even more coverage.  I&#x27;ve almost stopped wearing foundation all together.  This stuff is that good.  The only problem I have with it is that the product lasts much longer than the case itself.  I&#x27;ve had several of these and the case always separates from top and bottom.  The clasp to open and shut the compact just cracks and gives way.  So far it has never really caused much of a problem as far as a mess in my purse or anything, but it is kind of annoying.  Maybe that&#x27;s why they discontinued it.  But besides that, and a little bit of getting used to the way you have to apply powder, flip back to mirror, flip back to powder etc. because the sponge goes in the mirror side, not the makeup side, this is a fabulous product.  And it really does last for hours and hours.  I will definitely keep buying.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup and I can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.  It is light, but covers my fair skin well. I like a natural, but somewhat polished look and this delivers the job every time. I&#x27;m so happy that Amazon carries it and I don&#x27;t have to go searching and trying again to find my perfect foundation.</li>
    <li> The packaging is cheap (outer plastic clamp came broken) but the product seems to work as advertised.  I can&#x27;t carry it around due to the broken plastic piece that won&#x27;t allow the cover to stay shut, but I can use it before I go out...</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use this along with the lipstick line!  Does last longer than other foundations or lipstick. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> the power is dry but still applies like cream.  Blends nicely and covers perfectly.  Love it and will use it until my skin changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different powders and this one is alright, but I don&#x27;t think that I would buy this again when I use it up.  I like that it&#x27;s  SPF 20, but I don&#x27;t really pack on the powder very heavily so I still use sunscreen when I use the powder.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed to see that the stores discontinued this make up. I am very picky when it comes to powder foundation and when I found this one I thought I hit jackpot!!! I am so glad I can get it from this site.</li>
    <li> To compare with all other same products this one is the best for me so far. It coves age spot pretty well.</li>
    <li> I like this product,I can not find in my town,it work very good ,iI recommend this one for sensitive skin look like me,the price is cheap .... I will buy again</li>
    <li> I use another brand, but i wanted try world loreal and i am happy ,The product is like i expected, thank&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This powder is the only thing I&#x27;ve used for years and I can&#x27;t find it in any stores so I have to order it online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty white, so this powder was just a bit too dark. I ordered 668. It still looks fine on my face, but it doesn&#x27;t really match my skin tone. I guess it&#x27;s really my fault for ordering this one. Oh, well. On the other hand, this stayed on for a long nap, so at least it stays on for a good 4 hours while being smudged a smeared around.</li>
    <li> I consider myself a low-fuss sort of person, and the nature of my slightly chaotic job has me zipping from meeting room to meeting room, presenting in front of multiple groups of people throuout the day. I literally have little to no time to freshen up, and L&#x27;Oreal Infallible has been the solution to my years-long dilemma of hoping/worrying if I look &#x27;okay&#x27; as I go through my day. I honestly don&#x27;t know how I managed before discovering this brand of makeup. Now I feel confident throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over in the stores for this. I am so thrilled to see that it was here. This is such a great powder. It goes on very smooth and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel too dry.  Covers well though.</li>
    <li> Loreal Infallible Powder is lasting, makes your skin look very natural and it doesn&#x27;t make you look extremely powdery or cakey. :) This tone was perfect for me, I have olive skin tone, so Natural Beige was the right one. I recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Karla Ferrero</li>
    <li> I love this formula and I cannot find it in local stores any longer. It looks natural and feels smooth on face. Love it!</li>
    <li> L&#x27;oreal infallable Never Fail is great.  The powder is light,  but has great coverage for freckles, blemishes, sunspots, etc.  Stays on a long time but not 16 or 18 hours. Sometimes the compact is hard to open though but like the applicator sponge.  I like the sunblock too since I am outside allot.  I just wish it came in deeper colors for tanner skin.  I think the darkest is sun beige and that is almost too light if I have been out in the sun a bit.  But a really good powder,  best I have found so far.  Hope they keep it around for awhile!</li>
    <li> Works nicely &amp; is pretty cheap. Smooths/evens out the look of your skin. I use in combo with rimmel bb cream (cream, then power). If I was doing one of those under $20 makeup challanges or whatever I&#x27;d prob use this.</li>
    <li> This brand Infallible seems to last longer throughout the day. I have been using the brand for a year and even though I try other brands, I continue to come back to this one.</li>
    <li> I got this today and was so excited to try it out! I did and i absolutely love it!!! This is a new must have for me. It doesn&#x27;t feel cakey like some makeups tend to make your skin feel. This powder truly never fails. Thanks for selling such an amazing product at such a great price:-)</li>
    <li> excelente coverup... my favorite powder... i recommend it.. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Was looking for an inexpensive option to my Lancome and this is great! Will definitely buy it again. Love it!</li>
    <li> Flawless without being heavy and the price is much better than the more expensive powder foundations I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
