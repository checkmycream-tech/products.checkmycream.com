      <li>I am so glad I did!!</li>
      <li>I use this with refectocil blue-black lash tin; grande lash serum; and a lash conditioner, and I have beautiful feathered lashes that look just as good as lash extensions.</li>
      <li>AMAZING!</li>
      <li>My best friend even asked me to do hers....and hers are super curly and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good quality and</li>
      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Was going on a tropical vacation and wanted my lashes to look nice.</li>
      <li>But this stuff is super easy and great!</li>
      <li>It was super easy to do and my lashes look AMAZING!!</li>
      <li>That is my best advice hope you enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
      <li>So easy to use!</li>
      <li>Everything was perfect, the only one &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; is  the kind of pads.</li>
      <li>I would say, watch a video to get a better idea of what you&#x27;re doing, but I did mine on my own and it was easy.</li>
      <li>the end result was lovely.</li>
      <li>I would love to see a kit that includes the Lash Tint and the bottom eye strip to protect the bottom eyelid/lashes like the professionals use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>but it was actually more.</li>
      <li>They turned out better than I had hoped.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would prefer a slightly more relaxed curl, but will try using this again and would buy this product again.</li>
      <li>The pads were better than others I have tried</li>
      <li>It loosen up even more after put the lotions.</li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>Loving the new Lash Lift!</li>
      <li>It was pretty easy and directions were easy to follow, except for it</li>
      <li>It shipped right away and arrived in two days in the mail.</li>
      <li>Everything works great, the only thing is that the curling pads are for a more natural look, which would only curl and lift your lashes about the middle , this would a be great thing for somebody with longer lashes and not so face down like mines.</li>
      <li>It could be user error since it was my first time trying a perm</li>
      <li>Works really well!</li>
      <li>and I used the large size.</li>
      <li>It really opens up my eyes.</li>
      <li>I still use an eyelash curler to try to get the straight lashes to curl with the rest of them.</li>
      <li>The application was a bit tricky as it seems the instructions are missing just a tad more detail, like how you are meant to remove the chemicals between each coating, put I fumbled my way through it and</li>
      <li>I have used one other eyelash perm kit by a different manufacturer and this kit is MUCH better than that one and didn&#x27;t irritate or burn my eyes at all.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Then I went to a salon to get them professionally permed and the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; made a huge mess.</li>
      <li>This is directly effect the result.</li>
      <li>So looks like that bottle can not last much longer.</li>
      <li>My lashes are long, straight, and crisscross.</li>
      <li>I used the large thinking it would be less of a curl</li>
      <li>I had a couple of stray lashes per eye that just wouldn&#x27;t stay put on roller and ended up staying straight down.</li>
      <li>I left the salon with some lashes curled too tightly, some sticky straight up, and others crisscrossed-</li>

    <li> Worked well however the vp curling rods were difficult to use.</li>
    <li> One of the best I used.Will buy again!!Wish there was a bigger glue,Other than this,is fantastic!I use lash curling produtcs for 30 years now,and this one is different,the curling pads work like a charm,quick aplication,</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect, the only one &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; is  the kind of pads. I would prefer to replace it for a roller to get curly lashes</li>
    <li> Works really well! However I&#x27;m not sure why the glue does not stick well, any pointers?</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect for the price. It&#x27;s good quality and the lash pads are great. I totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have long, extremely straight/downward lashes and a double fold Asian eye. The pads were better than others I have tried and I used the large size. It was pretty easy and directions were easy to follow, except for it just said to remove the solution from eye before going to next step, but didn&#x27;t say how thoroughly that had to be removed. I just wiped it off with a q-tip and paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the trickiest part is that the glue is a little bit stringy and hard to get every eyelash to stick to the roller pad. I also had a hard time placing the silicone roller pad onto my eyelid and then securing it so it wouldn&#x27;t move. I had a couple of stray lashes per eye that just wouldn&#x27;t stay put on roller and ended up staying straight down. I like the curl it provided, but it was a little bit too curly on one eye at the tips of the eyelashes. It could be user error since it was my first time trying a perm and I did it myself. I still use an eyelash curler to try to get the straight lashes to curl with the rest of them. I have used one other eyelash perm kit by a different manufacturer and this kit is MUCH better than that one and didn&#x27;t irritate or burn my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would prefer a slightly more relaxed curl, but will try using this again and would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It works great except the glue. It didn&#x27;t hold the eye lash. It loosen up even more after put the lotions. So I need to use a lot to reapply the glue. So looks like that bottle can not last much longer. This is directly effect the result.</li>
    <li> It works, lifts my straight boring eyelashes. Only problem I have is the smell of the product. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a 5 star product</li>
    <li> Was going on a tropical vacation and wanted my lashes to look nice. They turned out better than I had hoped. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I did it and they still look fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and I&#x27;ve used this product in the salon. It is a perm for your lashes that makes them look longer and fuller for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this! I didn&#x27;t know if I wanted to get this and use it on other people, I was afraid it might burn off lashes or not work or anything bad that could happen but I have used several times since I have gotten it and it works great.. DEFINABLY DO NOT TRY TO DO TO YOUR SELF YOU COULD GET IT INTO YOUR EYE THEN IT WOULD BE BAD HAVE SOMEONE DO IT FOR YOU AND READ INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM!! That is my best advice hope you enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> Wonderful service. Great product.</li>
    <li> great product will order again</li>
    <li> Loving the new Lash Lift! It&#x27;s replacing the Lash Perm in our Spa!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted my lashes permed but had no one in rural WV who provides this service. I was feeling brave and bought this kit......I am so glad I did!! It was super easy to do and my lashes look AMAZING!! My best friend even asked me to do hers....and hers are super curly and beautiful. This is definitely idiot proof! LOVE this kit!!</li>
    <li> Easy and it works great. I would say, watch a video to get a better idea of what you&#x27;re doing, but I did mine on my own and it was easy.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! So easy to use! For me, it lasts about 2-3 weeks, before my new lashes start growing in straight again, then my lashes get all crazy when I try to curl them with a lash curler, but it has nothing to do with the product -- it&#x27;s just what happens with any lash perm, even if you were to get them done. But this stuff is super easy and great! I do it on my lower lashes too sometimes! It really opens up my eyes.</li>
    <li> I tried the Lomansa kit a few years ago and it was useless. Then I went to a salon to get them professionally permed and the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; made a huge mess. My lashes are long, straight, and crisscross. I left the salon with some lashes curled too tightly, some sticky straight up, and others crisscrossed- this is the reason why I like to do things myself. So I started researching and thought I&#x27;d try Dolly Lash. Wow! I love this stuff! The glue is great, the silicon pads are great, and my lashes look great! I use this with refectocil blue-black lash tin; grande lash serum; and a lash conditioner, and I have beautiful feathered lashes that look just as good as lash extensions.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit! Everything works great, the only thing is that the curling pads are for a more natural look, which would only curl and lift your lashes about the middle , this would a be great thing for somebody with longer lashes and not so face down like mines. I used the medium size. I will still continue to use it but I probably buy the roads and use with the glue.</li>
    <li> Loved it. It shipped right away and arrived in two days in the mail. The application was a bit tricky as it seems the instructions are missing just a tad more detail, like how you are meant to remove the chemicals between each coating, put I fumbled my way through it and the end result was lovely. Also, would help to explain what the different sizes mean. I used the large thinking it would be less of a curl but it was actually more. Next time I will use the medium. I would love to see a kit that includes the Lash Tint and the bottom eye strip to protect the bottom eyelid/lashes like the professionals use.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, wonderful results and I have recommended this to all my friends. No need for extentions or even mascara. I have bambi eyes and it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
