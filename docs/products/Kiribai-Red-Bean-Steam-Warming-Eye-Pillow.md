<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The heat lasts about 10 minutes. And my eyes feel relaxed after using it. But, the design of the pillow is a little strange to me. It seems to warm the areas surrounding eyes while avoiding warming the eye areas directly.</li>
    <li> Very novel product. Just put in the Microwave for about 23s. (That&#x27;s what I do) my eyes are so relieved.</li>
    <li> i like it because it&#x27;s re-usable.</li>
    <li> Love the sweat smell it gives off after nuking it. and it holds the heat for a good amount of time</li>
    <li> The product is called &amp;#34;natural steam&amp;#34; eye mask. However, there is no steam, since there is no moisture to create it. For that I take off 1-star. I&#x27;d make a counter argument that maybe the Japanese kanji for &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; could mean something different in Japan, but the picture on the box of the eye mask steaming kind of says otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I like this product and do not regret purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it is: This is basically a cloth eye mask with a mix of green/red beans sewn inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works: You heat it in the microwave for 30-40 seconds, which heats up the beans. You then put the mask over your eyes. The beans retain the heat and work to warm up your eyes and the muscle around them. It is warm for at least 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result: I find this to be very soothing for the eye and face in general. My eyes feel good and well rested after using it. I use it in the middle of the day to rest my eyes, and also before sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;- All natural (uses beans instead of plastic and electronics or chemicals)&lt;br /&gt;- Good Value (eye steam strips cost about $1 per one-time-use-strip, this mask promises at least 200 times use, which comes to about $0.06 per use, is much better for the environment and your wallet)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy and quick to prepare - just put it in microwave&lt;br /&gt;- Feels good for the eye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wish: if there was actual steam to help moist eyes, which would help with dry eyes and irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU SHOULD NOT be wetting this eye mask. Beans may sprout (not sure if they would after being microwaved, but there is a chance they may turn mushy by being wetted and then heated)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; in the title and picture is kind of misleading, I am still glad I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> cute tingling feeling after apply.  very relaxing~!!!  It makes my mouth go watery when the smell of the red bean are in the air.  heating up the eye area and am sure it helps with the circulation.</li>
    <li> This is very helpful to those who suffer from sinus pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This warms in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;This is a cloth eye pillow.&lt;br /&gt;The pillow feels like it&#x27;s full of beans and feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MIGRAINES (how to save your day/evening if you think you&#x27;ve missed your window to take your meds):&lt;br /&gt;1) Immediately take your meds as you would at the aura-stage of your migraine.&lt;br /&gt;2) Wrap your neck with a scarf (be sure to wrap as many times as you can around your neck so your neck is toasty).&lt;br /&gt;3) Sip very warm water/tea (not so hot that it&#x27;ll burn you, but as warm as you can handle without any discomfort).&lt;br /&gt;4) Heat your eye pillow and alternate between placing on your eyes and your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;5) If you are prone to pain induced vomiting, you may want to eat some oyster crackers and/or suck on some hard candies (ginger if you can find them you should have them on hand).&lt;br /&gt;6) Keep you sipping liquids warm, keep your neck covered, and keep your eye pillow very warm until your migraine melts away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONG TERM MIGRAINE FIX:&lt;br /&gt;You may also look into taking Trader Joe&#x27;s brand chewable melatonin supplements each night before bed (or 9 hours before you will wake up); do this for a few months may significantly reduce or completely get rid of your migraines.  When you&#x27;ve had three months of taking one capsule nightly if you&#x27;ve been migraine-free for 3 weeks then you can stop taking these and the effect should last as your system should be reset.  If you&#x27;re still getting migraines at the end of the three months then continue another month until you&#x27;ve been migraine-free for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> easy to use and smell really good and comfortable!!</li>
    <li> works great! Feel comfortable</li>
    <li> They are just average nothing exceptional.</li>
    <li> Sent two to my daughter for birthday.....this one is her favorite</li>
    <li> Really makes your eyes rest.</li>
    <li> worth buying. It&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good as an eye mask but it kind of smells weird and I didn&#x27;t notice any steam...</li>
    <li> feel so comfortable warming my eye area. use it everyday</li>
    <li> very good for eye and can use many times</li>
    <li> Smells good after heating.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is 8 months pregnant, she felt hard to get sleep.&lt;br /&gt;After using it, her sleep quality is now much better.</li>
    <li> It shouldn&#x27;t be called &#x27;steam&#x27; warming. It&#x27;s just a microwave warming eye pillow. Cheep stuff but selling for a price which is not match it. Since it is from Japan, returning might cost too much so have to keep it. Only used once.</li>
    <li> The best eye pillow I&#x27;ve ever had. Use this after eye cream can make eye cream functions much more than you thought. I tried microwave 35sec. The temperature is just right for me.</li>
    <li> shipped really fast. it arrived much faster then I expected (in 12 days not 1 month). there are notes and litter gift come together with the product. very sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very easy to use. feels good for my computer-hard-working eyes.</li>
    <li> Very useful and easy to use. After applying it on my eyes, I felt comfortable !</li>
    <li> I love the package &amp; the hand written note:)! The heat from the eye pillow really helps to relax the muscles around the eyes. Love it!</li>
    <li> Does its job. I don&#x27;t know how sturdy it will be. The beans have good fragrant after heating so it is very good. I did not see any steam though - maybe you need to moist it before use? In terms of effectiveness, I have not seen dramatic improvement on my eye but I will keep using it and see any updates.</li>
    <li> Cute, simple to use, the use of the goods after the eyes are not dry, no pain</li>
    <li> i put it aside after first using. using warm towel is even better than this product, it is useless for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me very well .i only use it twice.i do not think I will  buy it again !</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and product looks OK. However the Amazon product description is misleading. It is green bean not RED bean (from the packing box). Also the the product is made in China rather than in Japan. It didn&#x27;t mentioned any where on the online description until I got the product (printed on the packing box). Since Japan&#x27;s food and personal hygiene product has much better safety record, this is only reason I paid the higher price for. Hate to be fooled by the sneaky product description again!</li>
    <li> there is no steam, but easy to use and comfortable. I like it, very good relax tool for eyes. service is good also.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your candy! It tastes really good!&lt;br /&gt;And this product is good as well!&lt;br /&gt;I also want to know where can I buy this candy  lol</li>
    <li> This thing works better than peer products.  It holds heat longer and seems to distribute it better.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Natural and soothing. Good for everyday use as a relaxation for the eyes. My eyes feel very dry when I&#x27;ve been staring at the computer screen for a long time. This eye mask is a life saver at that time.</li>
    <li> Great for my sinus headaches since it seems to release the pressure build up in my head and I&#x27;m a heat not cold kind of girl. Cold always just seems to make it worse for me as I&#x27;ve tried those options too. This is nice and warm and can be moved up just over the eyes too so it can help even more. I know that is not what its suggested use is but I adore mine.</li>
    <li> OK, not what I thought</li>
    <li> Really like this because you can reuse it many times and it&#x27;s easy to use. Great value.</li>
    <li> I  love this eye pillow!!! It really helpful for my sleep.</li>
    <li> I used it twice a day for about four weeks, and it works for me! My friend said my belly is reduced obviously!</li>
    <li> Works well, soothing and pleasant.  Though I wish the heat could last a bit longer.  Cost is a bit high.</li>
    <li> Very very cozy, comvenient and will relax you in only a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging, Great product!! It make my eyes feel really relaxed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh by the way,,,I love the little Japanese Candy present xD</li>
    <li> That is a good product!you should have it!</li>
    <li> Great great great product! All of my relatives love it! Relieve your eyes immediately and can be heated easily. Only one shortcoming: no headband. You have to lay flat till the product cools down.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t worth that much, just a bag of red bean, but feels good when warm my eyes.</li>
    <li> although it made in China, I think it is totally fine. Because it is not for eating, just use the steam of beans. very comfortable, and relaxing!! u also will smell the beans when you heat it, if overheat, it will show &amp;#34;dangerous&amp;#34; in Japanese. so, just wait for a little bit until the characters disappear, very safe, dont be afraid it is too hot for your eyes~!  it is perfect for using in winter time, really love it!!!</li>
    <li> it reaaaaaally worth to buy. good service good product and i love it . girls and ladies, please protect ur eyes</li>
    <li> Eyes feel good. Smells like food. Do not over heat! Good for backpain too.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma of red beans, which doesn&#x27;t dry your eyes like Kao Steam Hot Eye Mask (I also love Kao Steam Eye Mask very much, but I have dry eyes problem and it really dries my eyes).  Don’t expect “steam” coming out from the eye mask like the cover picture.  It retains the heat very well, so be very careful not to overheat the pad.</li>
    <li> when i ordered it on Dec.31, it said I would get it in Feb since it was mailed from Japan. But I got it YESTERDAY, and it looked like it had been in my mail box for days!!! I didn&#x27;t expect it could be so fast!!! I tried it last night. my eyes felt so comfortable after using it and it smelled so good. Really love this little cute thing!! the only problem is it&#x27;s all Japanese on it. Even though I have learned Japanese for several months, I really had a hard time following the instructions. However, it&#x27;s not too bad or too complicated. Very easy to use it ~~Anyway, LOVE IT！！！</li>
    <li> if you use your eyes a lot, and always feel tired, please try this item, you won&#x27;t be disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> Broken within 1 week of use. My wife warmed it up to 40 seconds as instructed and some of the beans melted I think. Now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> Now I can&#x27;t sleep without it. Not like other heating stuff it smells great when you heat it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s because they used bean(it won&#x27;t sprout because it&#x27;s fried). Also they used right material (I guess cotton not sure) for eye pillow.&lt;br /&gt;After using this eye pillow you can feel your eyes are way more relaxing and clear. After getting LASEK surgery my eye easily get tired and dried. I feel this eye pillow became treatment for me. If you have dry eyes, GET THIS.</li>
    <li> I do not find the smell to pleasing but nothing special about this product. I was looking for it to soothe the swelling but I wasn&#x27;t very pleased.</li>
    <li> so far so good....It makes me sleep better...i like it...and i like the smell...</li>
    <li> Last long, right weigjt on my eyes.</li>
    <li> First, you need a microwave. Well, it smells very good and relish your eyes perfectly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I cannot open my eyes with this!</li>
    <li> good product. works fine.</li>
