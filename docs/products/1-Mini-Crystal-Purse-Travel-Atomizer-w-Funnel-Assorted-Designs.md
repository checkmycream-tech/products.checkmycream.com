      <li>I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN  ESSENTIAL OILS</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use the tiny plastic funnel because I already had one, but it was nice that it was included.</li>
      <li>They are probably great in a desk or some stationary place when you need a small amount of fragrance.  </li>

      <li>Which was my biggest fear, but it has outdone itself in performance so far.</li>
      <li>I was concerned about leaking, because of some previous reviews, but this is just not the case at all if you twist the top down evenly.</li>
      <li>I was able to pour the contents from the broken bottle into the mini purse atomizer.</li>
      <li>They spray a nice fine mist, they don&#x27;t leak in my handbag, and I don&#x27;t find them especially difficult to fill.</li>
      <li>The funnel didn&#x27;t fit properly and you had to pour very slowly.  </li>

<li> Luckily the were in a plastic bag, but it was not a good situation.</li>
<li> I do not use the tiny little funnels, though, I just carefully pour my colognes into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The opening to the glass part is 3/8\\&quot; wide.</li>
<li> Not sure what material it is, but looks like it might chip or rub off in the future with wear and tear.</li>
<li> The only thing I would warn people about is that the funnel it comes with has a very small hole and which in case makes it harder to transfer perfumes....</li>
<li> No problems with filling, no leaks (not sure why other reviewers had problems?).  </li>
<li> Just a little messy as the spray is generous.</li>
<li> it arrived a few days before the given timeline.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now, and haven&#x27;t had any problems with them.</li>
<li> When I got the bottle and filled it the sprayer didnt work and all the liquid inside the bottle squirted out of the base of the sprayer.</li>
<li> Even going slow perfume ran down the sides of the bottle.  </li>
<li> but alas, one of my cats knocked it to the floor.</li>
<li> but I found it very difficult to get the perfume into the bottle with the little funnel.  </li>
<li> Do have to admit the funnel is small, reminds me of the tin man&#x27;s hat!!!  </li>
<li> It can be extremely difficult to find purse sized bottles of the perfume you want.  </li>
<li> Duh!!!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t look bad on the bureau.</li>

    <li> Pretty, compact and nice for gifts -- i used DIY rosewater in mine-- but cheap.  The spray head pops off regularly, but does pop back on.  So, you know; you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> for the price these little atomizers are really nice and they shipped in great time.  They are just the size you need to not clutter up your hand bag. can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with them. They arrived promptly, and work just fine. I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now, and haven&#x27;t had any problems with them. They spray a nice fine mist, they don&#x27;t leak in my handbag, and I don&#x27;t find them especially difficult to fill. I do not use the tiny little funnels, though, I just carefully pour my colognes into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire container is about 3 1/4\\&quot; tall, and the glass part, which contains the liquid you add, is only 1 1/2\\&quot; tall. The opening to the glass part is 3/8\\&quot; wide. These are perfect for carrying a bit of your favorite perfume or cologne in your handbag to use as a refresher while at work or out for the evening. I find them quite attractive, and they&#x27;re exactly what I was searching for. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>

    <li> It can be extremely difficult to find purse sized bottles of the perfume you want.  These bottle are not only the perfect size but they&#x27;re aesthetically pleasing.  They&#x27;d be great for anyone who makes their own fragrances as well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN  ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE PERFECT FOR WHAT I DO.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS NATURAL COSMETICS</li>

    <li> These have been perfect for our own homemade perfumes.  Comes with its own funnel and the spray has been working just fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered a huge bottle of a new perfume from Nordies and thought, \\&quot;I need a mini atomizer to carry some of it with me when I am out and about\\&quot;. I received the one in the middle. I love this style. It reminds me of something old school Dior, in design. I love that it is glass and not plastic, therefore the plastic will not leach into the perfume. It comes with a mini funnel. You just spray your FAV perfume into the funnel until the adorable glass bottle is filled up. I was concerned about leaking, because of some previous reviews, but this is just not the case at all if you twist the top down evenly. Duh!!! No leakage and I throw it in my purse! The only concern is the cap. It is coated in a cheap looking coppery gold dip. Not sure what material it is, but looks like it might chip or rub off in the future with wear and tear. Just a guess from life experience, but nothing that has actually happened. Very happy with purchase! Great price and super speedy shipping. Highly recommend.</li>

    <li> These leak.  They are probably great in a desk or some stationary place when you need a small amount of fragrance.  I used them for traveling and they leaked.  Luckily the were in a plastic bag, but it was not a good situation.</li>

    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, I like these when I travel instead of carrying the bottle.  Do have to admit the funnel is small, reminds me of the tin man&#x27;s hat!!!  All in all, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Nice little funnel included. Just used it again this evening to reload. Just a little messy as the spray is generous. Value for the $</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this little atomizer it is so cute and does not leak. Which was my biggest fear, but it has outdone itself in performance so far. Great product all around. The only thing I would warn people about is that the funnel it comes with has a very small hole and which in case makes it harder to transfer perfumes....but it still works. I would more than likely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of perfume that I really liked but alas, one of my cats knocked it to the floor. Bottle didn&#x27;t break, just one corner broke off so I was able to save most of the perfume inside...voila! I bought a mini crystal purse atomizer. I was able to pour the contents from the broken bottle into the mini purse atomizer. No problems with filling, no leaks (not sure why other reviewers had problems?).  And YAY, I got a new bottle of perfume for Valentine&#x27;s Day, so now I have it at home and with me for a refresher! :-)</li>
    <li> This bottle is over priced and it looks very cheap. When I got the bottle and filled it the sprayer didnt work and all the liquid inside the bottle squirted out of the base of the sprayer. I contacted the seller several days ago and never heard from them.</li>
    <li> Did the trick.  I didn&#x27;t travel with them, so don&#x27;t know if they leak or not.  Easy to fill.  Don&#x27;t look bad on the bureau.</li>
