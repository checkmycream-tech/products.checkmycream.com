      <li>Its not quite as shiny as the picture, but I love it anyway.  </li>
      <li>THANK YOU MANIC PANIC FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I purchased this lipstick for my Vriska Serket cosplay, and I&#x27;m not 100% in love with this.</li>
      <li>Seems to be more wax/base than pigment</li>
      <li>I got many compliments.</li>
      <li>Yessssssss I love this color on me.</li>
      <li>Love wearing it out on weekends</li>
      <li>How many TRULY do?</li>
      <li>IT STAYS ON VERY WELL AND LOOKS GREAT.</li>
      <li>This color is lovely. ..</li>
      <li>they love it and think it rocks</li>
      <li>The denser u apply it, the better the color pop.</li>
      <li>U have to put many layers (rubs) on upon applying to obtain the tube color.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more colors from this brand.</li>
      <li>If you rub the lipstick across your lip more than once, it makes lines as if some came of.</li>
      <li>With a similar lip liner its perfect!</li>
      <li>The pigmentation is love.</li>
      <li>High drama with great affect</li>
      <li>the color is beautiful however it takes a little more lipstick to get that full cover of the color on the lip, its a good product!</li>
      <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>Very nice shade and high quality lipstick.</li>
      <li>It went on great, looks great and is just plain awesome.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Very cool colour</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go  on too smoothly and has to be layered to get a nice full coverage look.</li>
      <li>Lipstick is soft, color is more darker than image, also, you need plaster more for good result.</li>
      <li>But comes off fairly easy</li>
      <li>Easy to remove with the addition of an oil based remover.</li>
      <li>Overall I love the color it has and its a great piece.</li>
      <li>Needs frequent reapplication, kind of gets everywhere, but it is a nice saturated color and not too drying.</li>
      <li>A beautiful royal blue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color after you apply a couple coats but even after applying eyeshadow to try and make it stay it still came off 30 seconds later.</li>
      <li>This lipstick glides on so smooth and full of color!</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>Smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>It comes off on absolutely everything [including your own lips] and needs to applied persistently if you even want to keep your lips semi-blue throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I thought this lipstick was going to be darker, but when I applied it to my lips, it was light and didn&#x27;t go with my complexion.</li>
      <li>The color is fairly nice, but you have to put a ton of it on for it to look as intense as it should.  </li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>I would really buy in bulk, its just that great and used that much.</li>
      <li>But overall, the colour is very nice and metallic, and it suits me well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much darker, and takes many MANY coats of application in order to get full coverage.</li>
      <li>It looks amazing on, not too dark but not too bright either.</li>
      <li>this is not for you because It stayed nice and moist on my mouth for a long time and has a nice bit of sheen to it</li>
      <li>Pigment is rich and it does apply metallic.</li>
      <li>I was able to make my own blue lipstick and eeeveryone loves it :0)</li>
      <li>I purchased this for a special beauty project and it worked well.</li>
      <li>That being said this color is wonderful and stayed on nicely with only a few applications as I ate or sweated throughout the day</li>
      <li>True to it&#x27;s color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this in a rush because I couldn&#x27;t find blue lipstick anywhere in my local area to complete my Halloween costume look. This lasted all night. I only had to touch it up after dinner, aside from that my look never faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much I&#x27;m ordering different colors!!!</li>
    <li> This color is lovely. ..But only after you&#x27;ve layered it on as thick as absolutely possible and reapplied it persistently throughout the day just to keep it alive. It doesn&#x27;t last. It doesn&#x27;t last at all. It&#x27;s ridiculous to apply because it&#x27;s hardly pigmented whatsoever, and once you finally do get some of the pigment off of the stick and onto your lips, trying to reapply it more only shifts around what&#x27;s already been applied instead of actually adding to it. It comes off on absolutely everything [including your own lips] and needs to applied persistently if you even want to keep your lips semi-blue throughout the day. Cheap. Very cheap quality. I&#x27;ll likely shy away from Manic Panic&#x27;s lipsticks in the future.</li>
    <li> With a similar lip liner its perfect!</li>
    <li> It takes a lot of swipes to get full coverage and good color pay off. The formula is a little waxy and strange but the color is great once you get enough on. A beautiful royal blue.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff. Needs frequent reapplication, kind of gets everywhere, but it is a nice saturated color and not too drying.</li>
    <li> Slightly darker than shown in the picture. I first had to apply a nude lipstick then the blue to achieve the color that&#x27;s in the photo. But nice, nonetheless.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU MANIC PANIC FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. IT STAYS ON VERY WELL AND LOOKS GREAT. I WILL BE BUYING FROM YOU AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviews, you need to layer on the lipstick for the rich, blue color. Awesome try, but would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It looks good on my lips💋</li>
    <li> I am sticking with this brand. The quality is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> True to it&#x27;s color. Nice lip stick!</li>
    <li> I wish it had a little more moisture. Other than that.... pretty much amazing.</li>
    <li> I got the scream of thrill from my 19 year old daughter with the color. So it&#x27;s been a good buying decision and she has had no issues with using the product.</li>
    <li> The color is a little thin. I couldn&#x27;t put it on over chap stick. I had to have dry clean lips. Other then that great.</li>
    <li> I just got this today tried it on and love how dark it is.</li>
    <li> Great color!! Super fast delivery! I was going for more of s cobalt blue but it&#x27;s a bit darker more on the side of navy but I absolut love it! So I&#x27;m not bothered by the difference</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I got this product for an anime con that was coming up and all I can say is its AMAZING. It went on great, looks great and is just plain awesome.\\&quot; Quote from my daughter who used this product.</li>
    <li> Takes a few swipes to get the color right but once you do it&#x27;s amazing! I would really buy in bulk, its just that great and used that much. I get many compliments on the color. Its nice if you&#x27;re emo, goth or scene and even just if you feel adventurous in your daily routine and want to spice it up with a new out of the box color. I am one happy customer!</li>
    <li> This product really sucked, it is made cheaply &amp; didn&#x27;t have much color.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t go  on too smoothly and has to be layered to get a nice full coverage look. I used a blue lip liner to as a base which made the color a little better</li>
    <li> The color is fairly nice, but you have to put a ton of it on for it to look as intense as it should.  It goes on an indigo purple and seems to fade to a pale pastel blue very quickly.  When you apply it thickly, though, it&#x27;s very nice.  I recommend it for taking photos, but not for wearing out because it requires reapplication at least every hour.  If you do purchase it, I recommend setting it with a similarly colored eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lipstick for a while and have only used it once.  While I love the color, there&#x27;s not enough pigmentation. Seems to be more wax/base than pigment and it comes out very streaky.  I was able to make my own blue lipstick and eeeveryone loves it :0)</li>
    <li> Great pigmentation at an affordable price</li>
    <li> The color wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as I expected,  but I still loved it.</li>
    <li> Great item as describe AAA+++</li>
    <li> I thought this lipstick was going to be darker, but when I applied it to my lips, it was light and didn&#x27;t go with my complexion. I only used it once and threw it away. I deem this product a waste of my time and money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely a fan of really fun lipstick colors so when I saw this I just had to have it!&lt;br /&gt;Only issue i&#x27;d say is that the color isn&#x27;t as dark as I would have liked it to be and once it dries it tends to set in creases and you need to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I will probably be purchasing more of the other shades they have!</li>
    <li> High drama with great affect</li>
    <li> Love the color ...love the quality ...happy to have found such a wonderful treasure for a great price ...I&#x27;m definitely gonna buy several more...don&#x27;t want to ever run out of this color!</li>
    <li> I love the color, my issue with it is that it is very sheer and as it&#x27;s blue it is reminiscent of what I look like half froze to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The color is buildable so you can achieve a good blue coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not stay put! It blots itself off of one lip onto the other and smears easily; and eating or drinking are out of the question.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a special beauty project and it worked well. Applies and wears well. Easy to remove with the addition of an oil based remover.</li>
    <li> Rocking this lip color with Hard Candy&#x27;s light blue gloss in a tube top was great fun on girls&#x27; night out!</li>
    <li> As with all cool tones, this blue takes a few more swipes for people with red lips to get the coverage they desire. That being said this color is wonderful and stayed on nicely with only a few applications as I ate or sweated throughout the day (no Judgement please). It feel really nice on my lips and reminded me of a Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s chap-stick. If you like matte lipsticks this is not for you because It stayed nice and moist on my mouth for a long time and has a nice bit of sheen to it</li>
    <li> Not as dark as I expected, and a bit waxy. But overall, the colour is very nice and metallic, and it suits me well.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is equivalent to a Crayola crayon. Very waxy and very little pigment. It&#x27;s a cheap product and very disappointing.</li>
    <li> A very vibrant and somewhat deep blue. It really stands out, especially with a contrasting hair color. Goes great with other Manic Panic makeup.</li>
    <li> I really like these lipsticks. They render gr8 color. U have to put many layers (rubs) on upon applying to obtain the tube color. The denser u apply it, the better the color pop. The pigmentation is love. They are surprisingly moist enough for colors like these. They&#x27;re very funky &amp; fun to wear. Even ppl who have inhibitions with venturing off into colorful land will enjoy these. They don&#x27;t last through kissing, drinking &amp; eating. How many TRULY do? Know wut I mean? They have enough lasting power with a few touch ups throughout the day. Lastly, the price point is pretty good. So, get out &amp; get u some color. ;-)</li>
    <li> I purchased this lipstick for my Vriska Serket cosplay, and I&#x27;m not 100% in love with this. However, it does get the job done. It takes a few layers to get the color opaque, but as I usually do this while applying lipstick anyway, that didn&#x27;t bother me as much. The color is darker than I expected, which may have been affected by my skin tone, although I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned. The lipstick is also not very soft, for lack of a better word; it&#x27;s not very creamy and can be difficult to put on. All that to say, I do like the color and am happy with the quality. Not what I expected for the price, but it&#x27;s enough. I&#x27;d recommend this to someone who&#x27;s willing to spend a little extra time and money for blue lips.</li>
    <li> Its not quite as shiny as the picture, but I love it anyway.  I love it for the days I am feeling blue.</li>
    <li> You kinda have to use alot of it but it was the right color, and didnt dry out my lips.</li>
    <li> this isn&#x27;t as pigmented as i would have liked but i  guess it isn&#x27;t bad</li>
    <li> When I first opened it, I was pretty psyched, because sometimes when you buy makeup from on line, the color isn&#x27;t quite the same. While I was very happy that the color was almost spot on with the picture, my happiness evaporated when I saw the coverage of the lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was hoping that maybe it was the type that you have to apply 2 times for full coverage. Instead, even after 3 applications, I had coverage towards the outside, but could still clearly see the color suspended in the lipstick that chose to settle into the crevaces of my lips and my natural lipcolor towards the center. As can be expected, it&#x27;s lasting ability was also poor. While it was somewhat moisturizing, the coverage and quality of this lipstick is about the same quality you would find in those cheap black lipsticks that everyone wants to sell around Halloween. However, considering the fact that this is not some cheap $1 no-name lipstick, it&#x27;s easily subpar and the reason behind my lower rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with my purchase- the only reason I did not give it one star was because of the good color and moisture. But lacking the other crucial components of a good lipstick, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this purchase to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that Lime Crime had a blue version of their Serpentina. However, as they don&#x27;t, I may try Secret Kisses or Ka&#x27;oir for my shimmering deep blue lipstick</li>
    <li> Takes a few coats to get a solid color.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Applies streaky/uneven on the lips, appearing too sheer at first, then caking and looking patchy if you try to build up the color.  Tried a number of times since I bought it, and it just won&#x27;t work.  Can not be applied/built up with a lip brush, unless you want hardly any color at all on your lips.  Wipes off very easily.  Right after getting this, I found out Nyx Cosmetics had come out with some blue lipsticks of similar shade...had I known I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted money on this.</li>
    <li> Lipstick is soft, color is more darker than image, also, you need plaster more for good result.</li>
    <li> Different. Very cool colour</li>
    <li> This lipstick was for a halloween costume. It is quite waxy which helped me as I wanted to put it on thickly. It stayed on well for hours into the night. It is a deep dark blue.</li>
    <li> Not their best, but the color is quite forgiving. Nosferatu is a ton better, but the color is too beautiful for me to hate it. I got this in midnight blue and would need a primer or a quality base lipstick to mix it with.</li>
    <li> You need to use a blue eyeliner to line your lips, but over all the color is beautiful and looks great! Five star in cosmetics!</li>
    <li> Love the color and the feel</li>
    <li> I like it but it have a purple tint ,not completed a dark blue as shown</li>
    <li> This blue looks great on a dark or pale skin tone.  It&#x27;s great if you have a blue velvet or black velvet dress.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and easy. A bit of a grayish purplish under-tone to it. Does need to be reapplied after eating. Overall a great product. Really leaves your lips smooth! :D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but it&#x27;s just not bold enough for me. It works it you have small lips and don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage. I like a lot of coverage on my lips. I don&#x27;t like creases in my lipstick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice color but it applies very thing and even with multiple coats it&#x27;s not the color it appears to be.</li>
    <li> It comes on a little opaque, but if you put some layers it really looks fabulous!</li>
    <li> Color is very &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; looking and product is very hard to apply-feels like hard wax.</li>
    <li> I put it on and loved it, but then I grew less fond of it when it stared to wear off. It meet y color expectations.</li>
    <li> The image depicts one colour and the actual product shows another. Over all this was a great product. It sticks well ;D</li>
    <li> My daughter and her friends wear this a lot. they love it and think it rocks</li>
    <li> Be prepared to put multiple layers of the lipstick on. Once you do that, the color is very pretty.</li>
    <li> Very nice shade and high quality lipstick.Very easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; it on.The lipstick didn&#x27;t have that fake waxy taste either.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is kind of waxy. If you rub the lipstick across your lip more than once, it makes lines as if some came of. Not really what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Those who love blue lipstick.  I would recommend this product to people who would like their lips blue&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice color and if you are trying to dress up like the people in Avatar this is the color that you would like&lt;br /&gt;your lips to be</li>
    <li> I love manic panic products! This lipstick glides on so smooth and full of color! It even comes stays on and doesnt fade like others do</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who was looking for blue lipstick, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and she absolutely loved it.  Was dark enough to be seen and has a nice metallic color to it.  Not exactly sure why you would want blue lipstick, but if you are looking for some I would definitely recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> the lipstick arrived on time  with no problems. (  even after sitting in a hot mailbox in Arizona)  the color is exactly as pictured,  and not sheer  at all.  my only complaint is you have to use several applications to get the true blue color,  and it only lasts a  couple of hours.  my natural lip color is a  medium/dark pink,  and I  had to I apply it three times  to get that  true, midnight blue color,  that&#x27;s opaque.  After 1  meal,  it needed to be reapplied a  couple of hours later.  it&#x27;s good for a  fun,  bold  look,  but that&#x27;s it.  it feels good on the lips ( moisturizing),  but it&#x27;s definitely not a  designer lipstick that I  would pay a  lot of money for.</li>
    <li> It was okay. At first I was a little disappointed because it didn&#x27;t look that dark. You have to add a few coats to get it to a desirable shade. I mean, I wanted DARK BLUE lipstick. And this was more of... A lighter, more purply blue. It also wipes off easily, but I guess if you&#x27;re looking for something crazy but not too crazy, this is the stuff for you. I&#x27;ll probably wear it, just not as often as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
    <li> The color isn&#x27;t anything like the picture. It&#x27;s much darker, and takes many MANY coats of application in order to get full coverage. The metallic finish is off-putting, too. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, and it makes me concerned about the quality of other Manic Panic cosmetic products, especially considering the higher price point than NYX or ELF.</li>
    <li> Good color. But comes off fairly easy but I kinda expected it considering its a creamy lipstick. Overall I love the color it has and its a great piece.</li>
    <li> Looks pretty good, true to color although multiple applications are required for the real color you are looking for. Not a big deal, just apply, blot, reapply, done. Love wearing it out on weekends and it doesn&#x27;t get on my teeth.</li>
    <li> It is the color portrayed and looks good when I wear it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s translucent. I need to color in my lips before I apply this or the color is weird and hollow, like a blue lip tint rather than a lipstick. Also more metallic than I expected.</li>
    <li> I really love this color. Like the other Manic Panic lipsticks I bought, you have to put it on a few times since it goes on really uneven and thin. However, the color makes up for it. The blue is a really nice shade and is about the color that I had expected it to be. I get comments on it when I wear it out and all of them are positive. I would repurchase this should I happen to run out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Manic Panic for a costume and it is absolutely wonderful! The color goes on well and the blue comes out as something of a dark cerulean/cobalt mix. It&#x27;s absolutely lovely and is so nice I wear it regularly now! May try to order it from amazon some time in the future</li>
    <li> Im so glad I bought this, completely on a whim. It looks amazing on, not too dark but not too bright either. What you see is what you get.</li>
    <li> Great! Came just as it looked online. The lipstick is a good quality. Pigment is rich and it does apply metallic. All my friends love it on me.</li>
    <li> Does the job I bought it to do, but it&#x27;s waxy and requires multiple layers to get any kind of real color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sad that this lipstick doesn&#x27;t stay whatsoever. It&#x27;s a beautiful color after you apply a couple coats but even after applying eyeshadow to try and make it stay it still came off 30 seconds later.</li>
    <li> Pretty color but don&#x27;t last long at all. I have to reapply every 30 min or so</li>
    <li> Ive been looking for blue lipstick for a long time, and I finally found some. When it came in I tried it and it looked exactly as I wanted it too. I got many compliments. I definitely recommend Manic panics After Midnight lipstick.</li>
    <li> Yessssssss I love this color on me. You&#x27;ll have to put on about 3 coats to get full coverage but so what, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I&#x27;m writing the review from my phone so I can&#x27;t post a pic :( I will be ordering more colors from this brand. I&#x27;m a brown skin black girl and it looks amazing on me</li>
    <li> the color is beautiful however it takes a little more lipstick to get that full cover of the color on the lip, its a good product! and worth the price!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Smooth and creamy. Beautiful almost metallic look. Shimmery, like lipstick made of nebula.</li>
    <li> Okay but not as high quality as I would expect. Thick.</li>
    <li> Beautiful dark royal blue color, this was exactly what I was looking for for Halloween! High quality lipstick, I will definitely buy more products from manic panic in the future!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Halloween costume and LOVED it!</li>
