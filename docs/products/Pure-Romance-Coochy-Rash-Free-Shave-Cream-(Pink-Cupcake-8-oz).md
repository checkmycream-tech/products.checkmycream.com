      <li>Completely worth ever cent!</li>
      <li>But not at all worth the money!</li>
      <li>Thanks for stocking this! :)</li>
      <li>I love it so much and the pink cupcake smells so so good!</li>
      <li>This may be more hydrating or whatever, but I would much rather put on lotion after my shower than use this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, but not the same.</li>
      <li>It works just like the reviews I&#x27;ve read online, and it shipped rather quickly.</li>
      <li>Sure it smells nice, but it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
      <li>I liked body boudoir a little bit better but wouldn&#x27;t repurchase either.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth haven&#x27;t seen any real results yet.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells great and works about as decent as other shaving gels which is why I gave it three stars.</li>
      <li>the scent is just a plus;)</li>
      <li>Fast shipping !</li>
      <li>I love this product and it lasts a long time</li>
      <li>It makes your hair super soft.</li>
      <li>One of the Pure Romance Representatives ripped off a Cancer Benefit she was working at in Tampa Bay.</li>
      <li>I swear by Pure Romance Coochy.</li>
      <li>I have tried pure romance coochy and body boudoir.</li>
      <li>I am baffled so many people like this overpriced product with common, cheap, ingredients.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It smells like fruity cake and is very nourishing to your hair and skin.</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t have been any better ordered it and it showed up faster than I  expected</li>
      <li>I have course hair and this stuff really makes a difference.</li>

      <li>It is the ONLY product that have been true to the &amp;#34;rash-free&amp;#34; quote.</li>
      <li>I still not rashes when shaving my vagina, in other areas it was fine.</li>
      <li>But, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin as smooth as other products I have used before.</li>
      <li>Back in the day I would go to Pure Romance parties which is where I found this product!</li>
      <li>A friend introduced me to it a while back and after the first use I was hooked.</li>

      <li>However, on a positive note it did make my buddy smell of Pink Cupcakes which was quite lovely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything different than other shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s hard to make a Coochy shaving gel exciting.</li>

<li> Remember - always go &amp;#34;with the grain&amp;#34; when shaving the bikini line, to avoid those nasty bumps!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works just like the reviews I&#x27;ve read online, and it shipped rather quickly. I&#x27;m definitely happy with my product.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. I use this for my legs and I have no problems with razor rash anymore. Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Great cost, quick ship!</li>
    <li> I use to wax because it just looked cleaner. Finally I began shaving and had the redness problem. Just a little bit of coochy and it makes shaving look like a babies but. I love this product and it lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I love this product; however, I did receive the scent listed. Instead of Pink Cupcake, I was sent Vanilla Icing. It&#x27;s good, but not the same.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shave cream!!! A friend introduced me to it a while back and after the first use I was hooked. I never get razor burn or rashes anymore (Thank God!) This works great for the bikini area:) I would recommend this shave cream to everybody!  P.s. the scent is just a plus;)</li>
    <li> I have course hair and this stuff really makes a difference. I love it so much and the pink cupcake smells so so good!</li>
    <li> Too expensive. I don&#x27;t think this is worth it. Sure it smells nice, but it&#x27;s not worth the money. I still not rashes when shaving my vagina, in other areas it was fine. But not at all worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff will never use anything else! This smell is AMAZING!!! Will buy again</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t have been any better ordered it and it showed up faster than I  expected</li>
    <li> This product does not prevent razor burn, but it gives a very nice close smooth clean shave and it smells so good! I will continue using this product because of those two reasons.</li>
    <li> This product is utter garbage. Since I switched from this brand from my $3 grocery store shaving cream I&#x27;ve gotten more razor bumps and not as close as of a shave. Ironically the worst area shaving with this product is the bikini area. It&#x27;s difficult to see where I have already shaved on my leg because it doesn&#x27;t foam. This may be more hydrating or whatever, but I would much rather put on lotion after my shower than use this. Also I tried this as a conditioner for hair twice and it actually made my hair drier, I have no idea how that is even possible. I have tried pure romance coochy and body boudoir. I liked body boudoir a little bit better but wouldn&#x27;t repurchase either. I am baffled so many people like this overpriced product with common, cheap, ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love this product makes shaving a breeze no razor burn ever!!  And the smell is amazing if you love sweets :)</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to buy from. Smells great and feels good. Less bumps when I shave and legs and bikini area feel smooth</li>
    <li> The size and quantity are great. The smell of it is accurate. But, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin as smooth as other products I have used before. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Why I bought it:&lt;br /&gt;-Wanted to shave my man parts without getting severe razor burn and bumpage through the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it performed:&lt;br /&gt;- It really didn&#x27;t do anything different than other shaving cream I&#x27;ve used. Afterwards, there was still quite a bit of razor burn. However, on a positive note it did make my buddy smell of Pink Cupcakes which was quite lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and works about as decent as other shaving gels which is why I gave it three stars. However, for it&#x27;s intended purpose of comforting my manly area from turning into bumpity bump central, it failed. Sorry for the terrible wording of that but it&#x27;s hard to make a Coochy shaving gel exciting. Anyway, it is not \\&quot;Rash-Free\\&quot; as stated. I would recommend trying something else unless you love the smell of pink cupcakes. Actually no, even if you like the smell I&#x27;d still try something else.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Goes on smooth haven&#x27;t seen any real results yet. Going to give it a couple more weeks. Y</li>
    <li> Love this product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great Stuff! Shave bumps and rash gone! Smells Awesome and great moisturizer for legs and face..Love it! This is my third order! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Nice for bikini area shaving.  Remember - always go &amp;#34;with the grain&amp;#34; when shaving the bikini line, to avoid those nasty bumps!</li>
    <li> I used it as hair conditioner.. it smells really good</li>
    <li> my gf loves this stuff</li>
    <li> I love Coochy Shave Cream.  I will never shave with regular shave cream again.  I never get razor bumps anymore which is great!!!</li>
    <li> Pure Romance is pure crap. Coochy Rash-Free is a total lie. My little bits were on FIRE for days. And more like liar, liar, panties on fire. One of the Pure Romance Representatives ripped off a Cancer Benefit she was working at in Tampa Bay. I will NEVER buy from them. Negative ten stars.</li>
    <li> Completely worth ever cent!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ! Love that ! I can&#x27;t wait to try it Ive hered awesome reviews on this !</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have tried all the scents they make. I have been happy with all of them. I really like the cupcake scent the best.</li>
    <li> I swear by Pure Romance Coochy. I use it as shave cream and conditioner. It is the ONLY product that have been true to the &amp;#34;rash-free&amp;#34; quote. It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have Extremely sensitive skin and I never have a rash or any other issues using this as shaving gel.</li>
    <li> Back in the day I would go to Pure Romance parties which is where I found this product! I haven&#x27;t had any luck over the years finding something that would do such a great job with leaving my bikini area rash free. Thanks for stocking this! :)</li>
    <li> This product is a must have. It smells like fruity cake and is very nourishing to your hair and skin. It makes your hair super soft. If you have sensitive skin I suggest you use this product.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product. Just one word describes the results, perfect.</li>
