    <li> I have been using the DHC Mild Soap for several years.  I use it daily with the face brush.  I keep it in the shower in the large plastic case.&lt;br /&gt;The bar I bought before this one, I put the date I started using it.  It lasted me one year and 3 months!  That&#x27;s with everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels great.  I highly recommended this soap and will continue making it a part of my daily routine.</li>

It comes in a hardboard paper box packaging that i just use as a soap container, and it works perfect. Definitely a product that i would recommend to everyone (actually a lot of my friends already uses this).</li>

    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year for smooth face!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, been using it for years!</li>
    <li> Have used this soap for a decade.</li>
    <li> DHC is the best skin care line you will find. It is a bit pricey but they offer generous samples and travel size. Velvet skin coat, Pacific Salt Scrub (which i think is now discontinued), etc. are a luxury you should afford yourself.  They are the only product I buy when i splurge on expensive top of the line skincare!</li>
    <li> I tried this soap to see if it would help my skin stop looking so red and irritated.  I have hypothyroidism, so my skin tends to get really dry.  I had been using Dove Sensitive facial soap prior to this, and my skin would be so dry that it actually would pull on my mouth when I turned my head after using it.  This soap has helped.  It rinses off really well and clean, and my skin is not near as flaky or dry after using it.  My skin still has some breakout and redness, but perhaps I need to ask a dermatologist about that (may be rosacea?)...</li>
    <li> This is a light but effective cleansing product for the face.  It&#x27;s easy to travel with and doesn&#x27;t melt like so many soaps. Also easy to fly with since it isn&#x27;t liquid.

    <li> I love this as a face soap I have very sensitive skin many products irritate my face, this soap is gentle and deep cleans even when I forget to remove my makeup first  I bought one for my daughter</li>
    <li> Best glycerin soap ever. Love DHC</li>
    <li> My cousin sent me this in my Christmas care package. I&#x27;m so glad I saved the box, because seven months later, I am ordering another. The first bar is not used up yet. I have several autoimmune diseases and many skin sensitivities. I love the mild fragrance, &#x27;rinsability&#x27;, and silky feel it leaves behind.</li>
    <li> it great. it helps me clean my face so good. I will buy it again.</li>
