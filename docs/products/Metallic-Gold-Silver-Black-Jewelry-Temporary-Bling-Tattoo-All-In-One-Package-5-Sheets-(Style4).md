<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Daughter loved these!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. I bought them for a beach vacation I will going on.  I hope they stay on as long as they did when I tested them.</li>
    <li> Lasted a really long time and a good price for the amount. Wasn&#x27;t in love with all the styles but they are still fun!</li>
    <li> These were super easy to apply and very cute!!</li>
    <li> Love the designs and how they show up on my skin, but I was abnoyed they weren&#x27;t long enough to go around my entire arm! (And I&#x27;m a pretty thin woman). These are good for bracelet or anklet size.</li>
    <li> This particular brand does not last as long as another brand I have bought on Amazon (can&#x27;t remember which, though). The black designs last the longest, while the gold and silver start wearing off the same day you put them on. The other brand lasted at least 3 days before wearing off. The designs are nice, but look for another brand if you are wanting it to last more than a day.</li>
    <li> I received this product free to try and leave an honest review . The hot jewels Metallic Temp. Tattoos was easy to apply just followed the simple instruction that came with it . It lasted about 6 to 7 days  and even than there was little peeling or flaking . I would recommend this product .</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Great quality, waterproof, and long lasting.</li>
    <li> The designs are absolutely fantastic and the look/texture is amazing as well. However, they last only up to 1-2 days, 3 days and it&#x27;ll probably almost be all gone. If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting flash tattoos, these are not it. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re looking for a flash tattoo for a special occasion or to do with your friends, this will be perfect!</li>
    <li> I used these for a party last night and everyone was happy.  The shipping was fast and the quality was good.</li>
    <li> The set of five sheets come individually wrapped. This was a bonus for me because I plan to give them out to different kids as Christmas gifts. I also received these before the expected arrival date!</li>
    <li> I ordered these just for fun, planning on using the majority of them for a trip to Vegas this summer.  I was hesitant to purchase these after reading that so many people recieved them free for reviewing (I did not), but since they were under $10 I decided to bite the bullet and purchase them.  They work about as well as I expected them to. The ring tatoos will rub off pretty quickly (within an hour for the part rubbing against your palm or another finger, and a few hours for the top of your hand).  I tried one on the inside of my wrist, which actually lasted a couple days.  It all depends on how much friction the tatoos are going to encounter.  For a night out, or an event that lasts a few hours, these tatoos are great.  The silver and gold colors are very bright, and I love the fun look of them. I would definitely purchase again, but it came with so many tatoos I don&#x27;t think I need to order more for a while.</li>
    <li> Awesome designs! Evrybody loves them and great price</li>
    <li> Recieved exactly what was pictured and am very happy with my purchase. The tattoos are easy to apply and look great! I&#x27;ll know more about how long they last after I go to Bonnaroo (the reason I bought them!) Hoping they hold up to the sun &amp; craziness of festival season! I plan to share them with those I&#x27;m camping with, since they are super cute!</li>
    <li> So many tattoos, and they&#x27;re really cute! Not super long-lasting, but what do you expect? Love the different styles!</li>
    <li> Oh my!  I tried going got Ulta and Sephora both and no one there knew what I was talking about when I asked if they had any of the metallic tattoos.  What&#x27;s up with that?  Anyway, I bought one pack of these and was able to split the whole pack between for both my nieces for part of their Christmas gift.  There are so many in this set that one for each would have been too many.  On some of the pages, I cut down the middle depending on what was on the page.  I was able to give each of them a complete set of necklaces, bracelets, along with all the other feathers and other miscellaneous.  I must say that their mothers were a little jealous over them!  The girls were ecstatic!  While only 8, I can see that they are quickly getting out of the age of cutesy type of things like most of the tattoos for girls were.  One of my nieces was wearing one the other day and it looked great.  Not a lot of wrinkling but that may be due to the youth of their skin:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the company emailed me on their own to make sure I&#x27;d gotten the product as they were taking a week off for Christmas.</li>
    <li> these are so cool and chic, they look so pretty and they are so easy to apply. I defiantly will be buying these again!! they even lasted while I went swimming!</li>
    <li> I am impressed with these flash tattoos. I&#x27;ve worn several pieces and I love them. They stay on well. I love the colors, the mixes of gold and silver.  I think they will look nice on any skin tone. My skin is usually a medium to dark tan in the summer and they show up nicely on my skin tone. I get a ton of compliments when I wear then. They&#x27;re a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product for concerts and festivals this summer.</li>
    <li> These are cute but don&#x27;t stay on longer than a day and was sticky once it started coming off.  I have some that stay on for 8 days and not messy. I don&#x27;t recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> fashionable good quality and great verity</li>
    <li> Some of the sheets are nice. Some of them aren&#x27;t so nice. There are areas that are missing due to a manufacturer defect. Just ok. I wouldn&#x27;t order them again!</li>
    <li> Cons: Don&#x27;t last as long as others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I put them on for a night bartending and next morning I noticed when I woke up that they were faded. After showering they were completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: great price and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they are great if just for a night. If you want a few days out of it, then these will disappoint.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s sister, she is a 25 year old yogi and I know she is going to love these!</li>
    <li> They are easy to apply and last for a while.  There is a lot to choose from</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t order again.  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> They stayed on really well! The color payoff was incredible. Would purchase again, especially for the price! Shipping was quick too</li>
    <li> Love them! I get so many compliments... Will totally reorder :)</li>
    <li> They last awhile. And I always get compliments!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and easy to use!</li>
    <li> My 7 yr old grand-daughter loves jewelry, but can&#x27;t help but loose it.  These tatoos were the answer.  She loves them.  They were the hit of her birthday party.  Everyone was a little shinier.</li>
    <li> Got these for my sister for Christmas to wear at music festivals. They are very good quality and do not rub off easily! She loves them!</li>
    <li> The sheet with my favorite design the feathers came wrinkled and humid. The tattoos are stuck to the clear plastic so they are unusable : (</li>
    <li> Great quality and my 11yo LOVES them!!</li>
    <li> Got them today unfortunately some of them would not come off I think they were already wet but stuck to the paper. Wasn&#x27;t very happy</li>
    <li> Great product would order again</li>
    <li> says lasts up to two weeks, definitely does not. Cute for the night of, but design does not last. Also, gold rubs off very quickly, and gold tattoos fade to silver very quick. Fun for the price, but I would probably invest in the nicer brand next time so it stays longer than two days</li>
    <li> These came out much cuter than I had expected! Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> looks nice but washes really easily...</li>
    <li> These were a major hit for our party. They do not come off even when you want them to.</li>
    <li> I got these as stocking stuffers for Xmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn them on regular occasions but also camping, when you really wouldn&#x27;t want regular jewelry. They do look good combined with regular jewelry though and I always get compliments on them. Mine seem to last a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put them on be sure to do a few seconds of planning. Check where the piece will line up (on your wrist, ankle or neck) so you can get the placement right. I had to trim them to get the right length, but then used the extra as a matching ring. If you can have someone help you that would be a good idea, they are a little trickier than a simple round tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would be great party favors for girls that are too old for cutesy stuff but young enough to expect party favors (pre-tweens and tweens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again, they&#x27;re just really fun.</li>
    <li> This set has a LOT of options! Though the jewelry looks very cute when applied, it is VERY water-sensitive, and only lasts about half a day- 1 day MAX. The good and bad aspect is it washes out very easily. Fun novelty to stay on trend, but would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Flash Tattoos, they rub off looking like rust. Not attractive.</li>
    <li> These are gorgeous! I saw these recently in a magazine ad and just had to have them. Great price for such pretty tattoo. The necklace ones are not my favorite but 4 out of 5 sheets are. I will probably use the necklaces on my daughter. So fun for summer you can&#x27;t go wrong and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Super cute and fun. The first day they look great but then they fade pretty quick.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and so much fun!</li>
    <li> clear, crisp designs and easily transfers to skin</li>
    <li> They are beautiful and exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> Love these metallic &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tattoos! The perfect accessory for summer. My arm band lasted for over a week and a half. Shiny in the sunlight! Overall a fun product.</li>
    <li> The instant bling made my foot stand out! It lasted for about 2 days. Looked like Henna.</li>
    <li> I loved the versatility of these designs.  They wear well, and arrived fast and in great shape.</li>
    <li> HUGE hit for a bachorlette party!!!</li>
    <li> These were great! I ordered them for my younger cousins and they loved them! I loved them so much I took a sheet for myself ;) Very easy to put on and they can last 2-3 (maybe longer)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-tons of options&lt;br /&gt;-tons of sizes&lt;br /&gt;-both gold and silver options&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I would love to see more designs besides imitation jewelry (ie: dream catchers)</li>
    <li> Too much gold for girl with light skin tone.  Black and turquoise ones are great.</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled when I surprised her with the jewelry tattoo&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for such a lovely and cool product!!</li>
    <li> I am having so much fun with these, sticking them all over! And they last a white too, been 3 days and only faded a little (and that is after thorough showers too)!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she loved it :)</li>
    <li> I received the order very rapidoe liked the request.</li>
    <li> Really quick and easy to apply! It doesn&#x27;t last very long until it starts &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; the glitter. Probably a day tops. Be careful wearing black, the glitter will rub off and be pretty visible. Otherwise, I really like the tattoos.</li>
    <li> These are the coolest! My granddaughter thinks I&#x27;m the best Grammy ever !😍</li>
    <li> i love them , easy to use and great shapes</li>
    <li> These tattoos lasted through the sweat from Hardfest! Wow, although it&#x27;s been hard to scrub off ... At least it stayed. Lol</li>
    <li> Love this so fun for the summer and it lasted 4 days !!</li>
    <li> good quality. cute designs. held up for a week +, cute to wear for many occasions</li>
    <li> Love these tattoos! Nice designs &amp; very simple to use.</li>
    <li> These tattoos didn&#x27;t last long only a day maybe but they are cute for the day. They do make better ones that last somewhere from 4-9 days depending on where you put them the hot jewls are only $9 and last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Great Quality, really do last a couple of days. They also arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love love love!</li>
    <li> The tattoos are easy to apply, and they look great!</li>
    <li> my daughter liked them . and she &#x27;ll ask another package</li>
    <li> I wore these to Carnival and they stayed pretty well until I got wet or sweat them off.</li>
    <li> These temporary pieces are perfect for summer outings, especially by the beach or poolside. I enjoyed the variety included.</li>
    <li> Loved these so much perfect for the summer!</li>
    <li> Very cool tattoos that last!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, great value.  Fun designs that last through a few washes.</li>
    <li> Stayed on better than the name brand and much cheaper too</li>
    <li> These are so much fun! Excellent product, wide variety of tattoos in the pack, easy to apply, and they lasted a few days. They arrived promptly and in great condition - no issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> So much fun! Loved the variety.</li>
    <li> These tattoos worked great for me, they were metallic, easy to adhere and they lasted a whole week if I didn&#x27;t wash over them in the shower. Even lotion didn&#x27;t seem to mess with them. On removal, most areas were easy to scrub off except the neck area. I guess the skin is thinner there and it was painful to scrub off what was left of the necklace. From my arms however, they rubbed right off with a little force and a scrub sponge. I have a lot of fun with these and everyone at the gym loved them.</li>
    <li> Such s good low cost for this popular great item</li>
    <li> loveeeeeeeeeeeee it.. received alot of compliments.. stays on for over 1 week but by the 3rd day it starts fading away. but thats why the package brings alot so that we can continue to add more metallic tats... im seriously addicted and im planning to buy more.. my co workers and friends already purchased them and the delivery was fast and amazing.</li>
    <li> My 12 and 17 year old daughters love them.  Easy to apply and stay on a long time.</li>
    <li> Worked great. They are still on perfectly after 3 days. Pretty and easy to put on</li>
    <li> so fun and last a long time!!!</li>
    <li> soo awesome! I took them to a music festival and everyone got a huge kick out of them :) a good buy for sure!</li>
    <li> Love it! Long lasting, easy to put on and stays on until you remove it with a little oil or alcohol based product. Remember not to avoid lotion or sunscreen on the part you will place the temporary tattoo as it will shorten it&#x27;s durability on the skin. It flashes in the sunlight and I was immediately stopped and asked what was it I was &amp;#34;wearing.&amp;#34;  The &amp;#34;bracelet chains&amp;#34; were subtle enough to wear in a casual business work environment. Reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted and she used her own money to buy it.  A better buy than the local store.</li>
    <li> I loved these! So glad they came a day after I ordered them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to put on and it really stay like 3 to 5 days. Awesome buy !</li>
    <li> Comes with so many different tattoos, it&#x27;s such a good deal. However, they did flake off my skin sort of easily, but did not on one of my friends, so maybe it&#x27;s just me? I did like them though.</li>
    <li> fun to use  fast easy apply.  good quality</li>
    <li> My 12 year old granddaughter put a tattoo bracelet on me. It was fun, got lots of compliments. Flying home on the plane the stewards said her 19 year old loves them too. I bought these for my 13 year old grand daughter&#x27;s b-day. They last about a week. Fun stuff for some one who would never do a tattoo! Grammy</li>
    <li> Very cute tattoos! Perfect for Coachella or any other music festival. Sent me a nice thank you email for purchasing from them too. I actually bought these twice because I liked them so much. Will be wearing them to EDC too.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter liked it.</li>
    <li> My daughter was eagerly awaiting the delivery of these temporary tattoos, and thankfully they are living up to her expectations! Great designs, and they look really nice after they are applied. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> So much fun putting these tattoos ! I love them !</li>
    <li> These lasted for over a week while on vacation in Jamaica and I got quite a few compliments.</li>
    <li> used while on vacation, stayed on well during the day but showed wear after a long night out and shower.  Some colors (black) stayed longer than the gold.  Regardless I&#x27;ve seen these elsewhere for MUCH MORE and these seem to do the trick for 1/4 the cost.</li>
    <li> Flash tats!!! Me and my friends had the best time with these at a music festival we went to. Four of us each had plenty to put new ones on each day for 4 days!! They come off easily, but not too easily. Stood up against sunblock, sweat, and salty sea water. Very trendy designs and easy to use. I would get them again in a heart beat. : )</li>
    <li> These go on super easy and maintain really clean lines. I noticed a little glitter on other parts of my body that came in contact with the tattoo, but it didn&#x27;t diminish the look of it at all. So far I&#x27;ve only worn these for a 1-day event and was able to get it off with soap and a loofa and some elbow grease at the end of the day with no problem. Looking forward to using more this summer.</li>
    <li> Very pretty temporary tattoos. I will probably order more.</li>
    <li> Love love love. Got them for a music festival and can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> They are sooo easy to apply and they really last! I had one on my wrist for a full week and it didn&#x27;t fade. I put a couple on my arm and they lasted a full 4 days and I removed it myself, it was still intact. Will definitely buy again when I run out! (leaves a cute/funny tan line if you tan with them on but that was expected lol)</li>
    <li> Such amazing tattoos...They arrived 3 days earlier than expected and worked amazingly. These are perfect for the summer sun and look so cute.&lt;br /&gt;They last for about 4 days which is pretty good, I think. Definitely exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> I feel like a kid on Christmas. These completely made my summer.</li>
    <li> These were a fun addition to a bachelorette party. There were a TON of options with multiple sheets in the package and they apply very quick and easily!</li>
    <li> I bought these for a weekend away with a group of late 20s/early 30s friends. They were a HIT! Everyone loved the variety of design, the easy application, and that they looked much nicer than regular temp tattoos. They also stay on and look good for days (good or bad depending on where it was located . . .). Easy to remove with some scrubbing and nail polish remover/rubbing alcohol/exfoliation scrub. Will definitely buy these again when the need arises!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my bachelorette party favors. The girls loved them.</li>
    <li> Very pretty designs and extremely easy to use.  The ones I placed on my fingers wore off quickly, I&#x27;m assuming due to the constant friction.  The ones on other body parts (wrists, ankles, etc) lasted FOREVER!  Very awesome product for the price, and is a steal compared to the ones sold online for $25-30 a pack!</li>
    <li> Lovely tattoos!!! The real test was going to be if it made it out the shower. Two days now and still looks fresh. Great buy for the price. Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> I was not too happy with this product.  It crumbles very easily and does not stay flat as the other flash tattoos.  I tried everything!!</li>
    <li> got this within three days of ordering and gave it a test run prior to a beach trip; the actual purpose I purchased this since I don&#x27;t plan on wearing jewelry while on holiday but wanted to accessorize somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: easy easy easy. so easy to use. they stick on great. this is my second day wearing the three I placed on me; ankle, shoulder and wrist and they look just like they did when I put them on yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, cheap. these are about a third the cost than the overpriced South Moon Under chain has them marked at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: there are none, imo. will definitely be getting more before the Summer&#x27;s through.</li>
    <li> High quality tattoos, really good price to quality ratio.</li>
    <li> Amazing, look great and stayed put through a beach weekend.  A great deal that I would most certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> Totally recommend gotten lots of complements and with proper care they can really last</li>
    <li> Bought these for my toddler who is recently obsessed with tattoos. They are easy to put on and super shiny. They do wear off pretty quick but they are temporary so, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Bought this item with a bit of doubt, would it be great or a big waste of money?  So INCREDIBLY and HAPPILY surprised.  So easy to apply and they look great!  I am so glad that I bought them and will order again!</li>
    <li> Love these tattoos and reordered them.  There is a good quantity and varied designs.  They last almost a week.</li>
    <li> Recently I purchased these Metallic Jewelry inspired temporary Tattoos.  This pack came with 5 sheets of gold, silver and black designs.  The designs were exactly what was shown and expected.  I decided to try a &amp;#34;bracelet&amp;#34; design and got plenty of compliments.  After a few days the design turned from gold to silver. This was ok with me, although I would have liked the gold to stay gold because there are plenty of silver designs included.  Applying the tattoo was easy and convenient. As stated on the directions, you peel the clear covering off the paper, apply where desired, moisten and remove the paper. This process took less than 45 seconds and the design was not chipped.  I purchased this product because I thought this would be cute for the summer when you don&#x27;t have to wear as many layers.</li>
    <li> Love them and they stay on very well usually about a week</li>
    <li> Love these! Just what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Great job! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Cute for summer days and sleepovers. The tattoos go on great and look great until they start to wear off. Unfortunately, they start to wear off a little too fast. I bought a different brand set from a craft store and those lasted a long time without flaking off. While these ones are adorable and just as shiny, they&#x27;re overall lifespan on the skin while maintaining form isn&#x27;t more than a day</li>
    <li> Perfect for all of your festival fashion needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Don&#x27;t put sunscreen over these, they will rub off. Also, don&#x27;t forget to take the plastic cover off....</li>
    <li> It comes off after about an hour .</li>
    <li> They were great for our event!</li>
    <li> These are awesome, took awhile to get off my skin :)</li>
    <li> These are really great and tumblr. They are really easy to put on and take off. Plus, the low price is something you can&#x27;t beat! I will definetky order again!</li>
    <li> Perfect! All of them look gorgeous! Easy to apply and stay on for a few days!</li>
    <li> Works great! Easy to use! Got a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> Easy to applied and remove</li>
    <li> Great price for metallic temporary tattoos.  Lasts a long time (too long actually; to remove, need oil and scrub brush or for super fast removal, nail polish remover if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!).  A lot of fun.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tattoos and good transaction.</li>
    <li> very nice product and timely delivery...thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent - the girls (16 - 22 years) loved them!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these tattoos!</li>
    <li> Love these! easy to applied and they last really well! Good buy</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for my niece, Kimberly (14 years old). She picked it out. I would never buy something like this for myself! I like real jewelry!</li>
    <li> I love the idea and they look amazing when you first put them on but they rub off a little too easily. Don&#x27;t put them on areas that will be rubbed a lot or they&#x27;ll fade. Other than that they&#x27;re fun, easy and very stylish.</li>
    <li> Great product! Quick ship.</li>
    <li> ahh i&#x27;m obsessed with these!! totally recommend buying!</li>
    <li> It was great except,  for some reason one of the sheets didn&#x27;t have that plastic part you have peel off b4 applying and the tattoos on that sheet would not adhere to my skin. Unfortunately that sheet included a tattoo I wanted to wear to a concert next week bc it looks like one that my favorite member in that band has. That was the reason I bought these and now I won&#x27;t be able wear it. So I&#x27;m disappointed about that. All of the other sheets in the pack worked great though, they look amazing.</li>
    <li> Cute temporary tattoo.  A more mature look that my pre-teen really loved.</li>
    <li> My daughter and her friends love these tattoos! They look great on too.</li>
    <li> Very happy with speedy delivery and product was exactly as listed. Thank you !!!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality! I ordered these when I was away on christmas and they were waiting for me when I arrived back home. Great product and the price is right.</li>
    <li> These temporary tattoos and fun to use, look really cool and last surprisingly long. You get 5 assorted sheets for a great price. This set costs more than double on other websites.</li>
    <li> Love them! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Fun and easy to use. The one I put on my ankle lasted far longer than the one on my wrist.</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast and they look great! Can&#x27;t wait to wear them this weekend for a bachelorette party!</li>
    <li> These worked great for a party, lasted multiple days and everyone loved them!</li>
    <li> I love these. They&#x27;re really fashionable and last a few days on my skin. Everyone comments on them when I wear them. Fun!</li>
    <li> These things are way cool. I took them to Firefly and shared them with fellow campers and festival-goers, and they were a hit! They look gorgeous and last for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, though: because they are metallic and reflective, you&#x27;ll have some pretty funky tan lines if you&#x27;re at a festival or outside for an extended period of time with them on. Not the worst side effect, though!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved them! so many to chose from!</li>
    <li> Very cute designs included.  The quality of these tattoos are sub par.  The gold ones quickly lose their color, turning silver in less than a day.  Some of them rubbed off completely in less than 24 hours, this is even while avoiding soap and lotion and applying on clean skin.  Others were difficult to remove.  Product is not consistent.  I would not recommend these if you want them to last a few days.</li>
    <li> There is a great variety in this package. I&#x27;ll be wearing them this summer to festivals, etc. Tried one out &amp; they go on really easily. I tend to hyper moisturize my skin so it lasted a day, which was fine.</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time. Fun present for friend.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, take literally seconds to put on, last pretty long and you can take them off whenever with rubbing alcohol or just soap and water too actually and they looked GORGEOUS. Got a ton of compliments. Stock up for your next music festival!</li>
    <li> I love them. it is a cute and stylish way to were &amp;#34;jewelry&amp;#34; with out the hassle of putting it on and taking off jewelry.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tattoos! They are easy to apply and wonderfully accessorize any outfit. The turnaround time between order and delivery was quick. Thank you.</li>
    <li> fast and just the same as its on the picture!</li>
    <li> I received my Metallic Gold Silver Temporary Tattoo order on Christmas Eve, and was very happy.  I had to immediately try one of the tattoo&#x27;s.  It looked so REAL, and went on so easy.  Friends commented on my attractive bracelet, and wanted to know where I got it, of course I gave them your information.  Also, I couldn&#x27;t believe how long the tattoo stayed on, through showers, hand washing, and even doing dishes!!!!  I&#x27;m so glad I found your site, I will recommend you to others...Thanks, Roseanna Goebel</li>
    <li> Wear off faster than real flash tattoos</li>
    <li> These were a hit at our beach party!  Easy to come off with nail polish remover too.</li>
    <li> Just as described! Love them. Last at least 4 days.</li>
    <li> these are addicting.  in an oddly perfect twist, they stay on as long as you leave them alone and they come off as quick as you scrub them off.  tons of options, i looked at several packs of these before i bought these and this one was by far the most bang for you buck.  what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> My daughters love these!!!</li>
    <li> The duration is very poor</li>
    <li> These tatoos seem to last the longest out of all the brands I have purchased.  They withstood being worn in a pool for an extended period of time.</li>
    <li> Great quantity for the price, but they do not stay on much longer than one day.</li>
    <li> So much fun...  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the ones we bought at JUSTICE FOR,GIRLS... But, it&#x27;s fun.</li>
    <li> These are so cute! I bought them for 24th beach birthday trip. All of my friends loved them! Great quality and great price.</li>
    <li> they are adorable and last really long. i just wish they had more colors and variety.</li>
    <li> These were terrible. Me and my daughter put one on and by the next day it had already lost its metallic finish. It looked very dull and began to rub off as well. I purchased the actual flash tattoos and they lasted for nearly 2 weeks! Very disappointed with these ones. Spend the extra $10 and get the flash tattoos if you want them to last.</li>
    <li> Great and great price</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter dance party and they were huge hit....all the girls and moms loved them.  Really easy to apply, look great and they last!</li>
    <li> Perfect, love them...</li>
    <li> Great designs, easy instructions,  and really pretty!  I love them and the delivery time was great.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great product</li>
    <li> very beautiful designs and the variety &#x27;, excellent product quality&#x27; / price</li>
    <li> LOVE it!!! just got this yesterday :DD and everything is beautiful! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love! This was also the best deal on this type of temp. tattoo! They go on super easy and quick! I&#x27;m using these to see if I like certain placements of tattoos and I&#x27;d definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love them they&#x27;re so cute and fashionable and they stay on really well I also received my order quite quickly</li>
    <li> Dope I tired one on my wrist and it lasted about 4 days and I wash my hands about a gazillion times a day. (Medical field ) love them</li>
    <li> 4 pages of fun flash tattoos, they lasted a very long time, wore them in mexico in the ociean and on the beach and they still stayed on! Very cool!</li>
    <li> these were okay.. Kinda cute. Didn&#x27;t last like real flash tats do, they came off after a day or 2.</li>
    <li> Love these metallic tattoos!! So fun for the summer! I&#x27;m so used to putting cheap tattoos on the kids that I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these!!! They adhere to your skin quickly and completely! Will def buy more when we run out;)</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  They look so pretty and last 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, hard to take off. Love the styles.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good product</li>
    <li> Top fits great but bottoms are small</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was wanting- great value and fun variety: you can cut any of these to make design smaller or to mix different designs in 1 tattoo. Only lasts about 2 days, but very worth it for the price :)</li>
    <li> my daughter tried, she love it, last for a week. It looks very shiny and cool. she keep changing designs and create her own combination.  best of all, the price is right.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, product as expected, fun.</li>
    <li> Got these for my niece. She&#x27;s 11 and loves them! But these are stylish for any age.</li>
    <li> I am having so much fun with my friends &amp; family putting on these fun and pretty temp tattoos!</li>
    <li> Loved the designs included, the bracelets are particularly fun especially for summertime wear. The higher end brands are usually $20+ or more. This was great price a fraction of what you would pay at the store and also prime shipping was available major plus! The designs were easy to cut and apply. It lasted fully intact for about a day and half. Now I just have to learn to be creative with the placement</li>
    <li> Awesome. Icebreaker for the ladies.</li>
    <li> These are so much fun. Ordered them for the second time.  Stays on your ankle for almost 7 days - not bad at all. Got a lot of complements on them, mostly from men :)</li>
    <li> A quick bling fux that isxeasy to apply and stays put for a day or two.</li>
    <li> Got &#x27;em fast! Love &#x27;em! Wear them out but also every day! Best ones out there! Thanks!</li>
    <li> They look really nice when you put them on and they go on really easy. I like the number of designs you get because there&#x27;s a lot of variety. the only down side is that they don&#x27;t exactly last long; I put one on my ankle and it only stayed on for 2 days. Guess that&#x27;s why they come with so many.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed by these adorable mettalic gold silver . they are affordable and they last for few days . I used it on my trip to LA and received so many compliment . It is amazing how little design can change your whole look . Love them I would buy from them again</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really pretty and I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so vibrant! Love the designs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the items I received. Shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> Fashionable, cute and easy to use. My daughter loves them and can apply them with ease (she&#x27;s 5!) The color of the tattoo remains brilliant on for roughly 5 baths, so has great durability.</li>
    <li> Just a fun product well packaged and received very quickly.  Also very reasonably priced compared to other similar type products that I&#x27;ve actually ordered.  Lots of sheets you can play with.</li>
    <li> Adorable and super easy to put on! Best temporary fashion tattoos for the price!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter in lieu of her getting more permanent tats.  Boy, what a smile on her face.  And what a great result after application.  She loved the look and got many, many compliments.  So now, me, the Grandmother, is going for the bling too.  Not over the top just on the wrist or ankle.  Great look, great product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I would order the larger package next time.</li>
    <li> Very good product and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful; however the quality isn’t the best. Some of the tattoos began to rub off after only a few hours! The shine also began to rub off after a couple days. The majority were ok and they were still fun to use so I am not too bummed out about it.</li>
    <li> Love it , it has so many nice designs and 5 sheets for a really good price</li>
    <li> As expected...cute and fun.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and look great!! Tip: Use makeup remover for easy removal.</li>
    <li> great accent for our solstice parade costumes and super easy to apply.</li>
    <li> They are good but they don&#x27;t stay on for long. To make them stay on longer spray hair spray directly on the tattoo. Otherwise good product!</li>
    <li> Stay on for days ! My girlfriend is obsessed. These are just as good as any other flash tats, they are all the same. Trust me save your money and order these.</li>
    <li> Great for party favors! I used this for New Years Eve and it was a big hit! Would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Buying more for sure. What you see is what you get and more!! I love these tattoos!! the pictures are just a few tattoos I tried out before going on a cruise next week! I LOVE THEM! I used one as a knuckle ring and also put them on my nails! My favorite Amazon purchase so far. I highly recommend! Easy directions and also ever sheet that is shown is what you get in the mail.</li>
    <li> Love these! They stay on for a solid 3 days before peeling (depending on where it is placed). Wish it stayed on for longer!</li>
    <li> Cute tattoos. Easy to apply and last a couple of days.  The selections are nice too. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful.  Even prettier ON person.</li>
    <li> Great product! I will buy again and recommend to friends. I want to also say that I especially love when orders have tracking for the shipment!</li>
    <li> These are surprisingly resilient against wear and tear. Had to physically scratch off most of it when I was finished wearing these temp tattoos. The metallic shines/holds up well too.</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Very cute! Shows up well on dark skin.</li>
    <li> One of the best items I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I love it. It&#x27;s fun and exciting to et creative with flash tattoos.</li>
    <li> Loved the designs but was kind of disappointing when the tattoos didn&#x27;t last for more than a day.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Arrived as described</li>
    <li> Really fun and great quality!</li>
    <li> They look great but they only last a day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had cheaper ones from Marshall&#x27;s stay on longer but for the price and delivery it&#x27;s ok. Decent variety in design.  If you want something fun and don&#x27;t want it to stay on longer than 2 days then this should be fine for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be fun for girls party of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get a few compliments on the bracelets.</li>
    <li> Great tattoos. My daughter loved them all</li>
    <li> Awesome and easy to use, great variety.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of tats - I still think a lot of people are going to be very sorry when they get way down the road of life - but I will admit these are not just cute (and wonderfully temporary), they are CLASSY. My teenage daughter looks like she&#x27;s wearing an eye-catching bracelet. Very attractive. We&#x27;ve hit a great compromise with these.</li>
    <li> They work great, they don&#x27;t last as long as I hoped, but everyone comments on them, and they are a fun must have for the summer!</li>
    <li> I sent these to my 11 and 14 year old daughters, while they were at summer camp. They loved it! They said the designs lasted and they had plenty to share with their new friends. Very pleased  would order again.</li>
    <li> I have recently been really into metallic tattoos and this product by far has been the very best purchase. There is such a large variety of designs in the packet to be creative with. My only complaint is I wished they lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Tattoos are beautiful, easy to apply, and will last your entire vacation!</li>
    <li> Great lasting fun.  Everyone was impressed and got lotsa compliments.</li>
    <li> I bought these exact metallic tattoos twice. The first time, I absolutely loved them! And they lasted several days. But for the second set I received, the gold was more yellow colored (not as pretty) and they wore off within a day. All in all, it&#x27;s a great accessory for an evening out!</li>
    <li> Really glittery, but after 3 days at the water park it started to fade a little. I had one on my wrist and after 1 week of after intense scrubbing it fuller came off. Overall I got a lot of compliments and everyone thought it was super cute and I payed a fraction of the price that I would&#x27;ve payed.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  It seemed to work best on hair free areas that were clean and dry.  Most didn&#x27;t last great through a few hours at the pool, but overall they were great with sharp color.  I was impressed with how easily they tatoos slid right off of the paper, but had to be careful not to start taking it off the wrong direction.  I loved the silver and gold in particular.  I only used them on my kids and niece and nephew, but look forward to using them myself!</li>
    <li> Great product and easy transaction. They are exactly what I wanted. At first, I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t be metallic enough, but they definitely are. Love them.</li>
    <li> Grandaughters loved them.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> love love love these... They hold up well on, some have even lasted beyond the 5 days they state.</li>
    <li> Its really good, but it only lasted for less than 12hrs</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as expected!! I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Beware of water if u want to look amazing with this beautiful tattoos!</li>
</ol>
