      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good clip for this price range.</li>
      <li>I loved it for the 2 months that it lasted.  </li>
      <li>For the price, they should make it with better &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>When I have moved it from my desk or my chair or my dresser to its correct storage location, I found it to be stylish and of good quality.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>And although the clamp looks durable, I&#x27;ll be ordering more for backups.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>

      <li>This clip is pretty, and of a good quality.</li>
      <li>Holds long hair great!!</li>
      <li>Excellent--holds my mid-back medium thickness hair very well and surprising light for its size.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that I twist up then clip and does hold my hair</li>
      <li>This clip is strong, well-made, and holds my unruly hair quite securely.  </li>
      <li>DO WORK GREAT to hold up my massive amount of hair.</li>
      <li>Well made and comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>Good quality, I will be buying more if they last.</li>
      <li>I am very glad I was able to find this BIG clip on Amazon because there are zero in the stores.  </li>
      <li>but so far, she has been very pleased with the hair clip.</li>
      <li>Not a bad hair clip.</li>
      <li>the  springs quickly broke in both  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find a nice big clip like this in the stores.  </li>
      <li>I bought the first clip and a second one later because I liked the strong hold.   </li>
      <li>My mother absolutely loves this hair clip.</li>
      <li>I have found cheaper, shorter clips at walmart that can handle it, although less elegantly than I would like.</li>

      <li>High quality.  </li>
      <li>So I decided to spend a little more money and buy her this hair clip.</li>

      <li>Looks nice and is the size and style I&#x27;ve been looking for, but for the higher price of this clip, I was surprised at how thin and rough the teeth are :</li>
      <li>High quality and extra large-just what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>For the price I wish they would reinforce that plastic piece with metal or something because it&#x27;s the same exact break point with every single one (</li>
      <li>I thought it was a little pricey, but worth it once I got it.  </li>
      <li>These are nice thick plastic and springs tend to last longer than some of the other jaw clips.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to use holding lots of long hair up on on back of head.</li>
      <li>Even though it is a little expensive, the quality is better and well worth the price.</li>
      <li>It is not wide enough to hold all my hair in a twist.</li>

<li> Decent spring to hold my hair tight.</li>
<li> thus can&#x27;t say how long lasting it is.  </li>
<li> Much larger lengthwise with bigger &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; and heavier plastic than other clips.</li>
<li> Perhaps if you have long fine/thin hair, it will work well for you.</li>
<li> It holds her long hair and has not showed any signs of wear since she started wearing the clip.</li>
<li> It broke in half after only 2 uses.</li>
<li> My only criticism is that the ends of the teeth on the comb are a little sratchy/prickly against my scalp.</li>
<li> Will definitely buy them again because they&#x27;re so hard to find in any stores, especially quality jumbo clips</li>
<li> I have this clip hold thin hair very well</li>
<li> It broke the other day while holding my hair up while I was taking a walk.  </li>
<li> Too big for my thin, 1.5 foot long hair.</li>
<li> The ends of the teeth are very scratchy when putting in my hair (not nice and smooth as expected), and becomes quite uncomfortable when wearing for any length of time because of rough teeth :(.  </li>
<li> I do have very thick hair down to the lower part of my back, so maybe my hair was just too heavy.  </li>
<li> :  When the seller read my feedback he/she was not happy that the 2 clips I bought broke (almost instantly) and, out if the goodness of his/her heart,  offered to send me 2 replacements because I may have gotten 2 duds</li>
<li> Because of this I have to redo it every few hours when it starts to fall.</li>
<li> I have long very thick hair and this clip doesn&#x27;t even graze my scalp.</li>
<li> but soon loses its spring hold.</li>
<li> update:  went back to wearing my cheaper clips because this one is so uncomfortable!,</li>
<li> After about a month or 2 of using them the little piece of plastic surrounding the spring breaks off and goes flying then the clip is useless as the spring won&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
<li> Holds my thin hair..</li>
<li> , I guess you can tell I am not a happy</li>
<li> &amp; i&#x27;m serious when I say 50!)</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>

    <li> High quality and extra large-just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Looks nice and is the size and style I&#x27;ve been looking for, but for the higher price of this clip, I was surprised at how thin and rough the teeth are :-/.  The ends of the teeth are very scratchy when putting in my hair (not nice and smooth as expected), and becomes quite uncomfortable when wearing for any length of time because of rough teeth :(.  I have fine hair that I twist up then clip and does hold my hair okay.  I have just received this so can&#x27;t say yet how sturdy/long lasting it is.   update:  went back to wearing my cheaper clips because this one is so uncomfortable!, thus can&#x27;t say how long lasting it is.  For the price, they should make it with better &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I loved it for the 2 months that it lasted.  It broke the other day while holding my hair up while I was taking a walk.  I do have very thick hair down to the lower part of my back, so maybe my hair was just too heavy.  If that&#x27;s the case, I guess I need to find a sturdier clip.</li>
    <li> Not a bad hair clip. Decent spring to hold my hair tight. My only criticism is that the ends of the teeth on the comb are a little sratchy/prickly against my scalp. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good clip for this price range.</li>
    <li> This clip is pretty, and of a good quality. Perhaps if you have long fine/thin hair, it will work well for you. I have long very thick hair and this clip doesn&#x27;t even graze my scalp.

    <li> Perfect for holding long hair.  High quality.  Will definitely buy them again because they&#x27;re so hard to find in any stores, especially quality jumbo clips</li>
    <li> Starts out okay but soon loses its spring hold. It doesn&#x27;t clasp all the way when it&#x27;s not holding anything. When you&#x27;re clipping your hair up you have to &#x27;squeeze&#x27; it together for it to catch and hold. Because of this I have to redo it every few hours when it starts to fall.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend to use holding lots of long hair up on on back of head. Much larger lengthwise with bigger &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; and heavier plastic than other clips. Well made and comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> It was a lot bigger than I thought!  My hair will have to grow longer before I can use it, but its quality is great.</li>
    <li> It broke in half after only 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Great clip. Sturdy enough to hold my waist length hair in a bun.</li>
    <li> I bought the first clip and a second one later because I liked the strong hold.   Good quality, I will be buying more if they last.</li>
    <li> Excellent--holds my mid-back medium thickness hair very well and surprising light for its size. And although the clamp looks durable, I&#x27;ll be ordering more for backups. Don&#x27;t want to be without one.</li>
    <li> This clip is strong, well-made, and holds my unruly hair quite securely.  I am very glad I was able to find this BIG clip on Amazon because there are zero in the stores.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have this clip hold thin hair very well&lt;br /&gt;easy and all you do is twist your hair&lt;br /&gt;in bun and clip it over, stays put&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;better then all the bobby pins,</li>
    <li> Soft plyable plastic, so it doesn&#x27;t shatter if dropped. Holds long hair great!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a sturdy hair clip to buy for my mother. She has long waist length hair and the hair clips that most stores carry today just do not last or hold your hair up for long. So I decided to spend a little more money and buy her this hair clip. My mother absolutely loves this hair clip. It holds her long hair and has not showed any signs of wear since she started wearing the clip. Time will tell if it continues to hold up but so far, she has been very pleased with the hair clip. Even though it is a little expensive, the quality is better and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS BECAUSE THE SPRING WILL SNAP WHEN YOU TRY TO FULLY OPEN IT.  I bought 2 of these (paid $10.oo for each one) and the  springs quickly broke in both  They are nothing but junk so save your $$$ and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  (so many caps, I guess you can tell I am not a happy customer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  When the seller read my feedback he/she was not happy that the 2 clips I bought broke (almost instantly) and, out if the goodness of his/her heart,  offered to send me 2 replacements because I may have gotten 2 duds or maybe they were &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34; in shipping (don&#x27;t know.).  I would rate the seller at 10+ stars but I will leave the 1 star for the clips.</li>
    <li> These are nice thick plastic and springs tend to last longer than some of the other jaw clips.</li>
    <li> Too big for my thin, 1.5 foot long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased about 50 of these things. I have butt length hair and these clips DO WORK GREAT to hold up my massive amount of hair. The problem is they break! After about a month or 2 of using them the little piece of plastic surrounding the spring breaks off and goes flying then the clip is useless as the spring won&#x27;t work anymore. For the price I wish they would reinforce that plastic piece with metal or something because it&#x27;s the same exact break point with every single one (&amp; i&#x27;m serious when I say 50!)</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find a nice big clip like this in the stores.  I thought it was a little pricey, but worth it once I got it.  Holds my thin hair.. and I think it would be good for thick hair too!</li>
    <li> A member of the household bought this.  When I have moved it from my desk or my chair or my dresser to its correct storage location, I found it to be stylish and of good quality.  I would rate it 5 stars if it came with an elastic loop to attach it to some part of the wearer so that it does not get left around the house.</li>
