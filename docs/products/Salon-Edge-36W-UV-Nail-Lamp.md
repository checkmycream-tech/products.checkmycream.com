<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome and it was a great price. So far I have had it over 2 years and it still works great.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift, so I can&#x27;t say much abou it.</li>
    <li> I used to have a smaller unit that I had to wait forever for my nails to cure. This cures them in no time at all. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product came before the Arrival time, came in perfect condition, same conditions as advertised, love te color!! Easy to work with and am super happy with results!! I will defiantly recommend this to other nail techs</li>
    <li> I bought this in 2014, and it still works to this day! Does the job, has a timer for 1 minute and then shuts off. So convenient since I never look at a timer. Between the years of having it, I have had to buy replacement bulbs, once.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! I am a cosmetology instructor and use this for both personal use and instruction. I use is primarily with Gelish brand products and it&#x27; excellent! I recommended students purchase it to get started in the industry if they can&#x27;t afford the LED lamps. I&#x27;ve been using since 2013 (currently 2015) and haven&#x27;t had to replace the bulbs yet!</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to put together and use</li>
    <li> I gave this product only one star because it does not work. I had my gel painted real nails (not acrylic or glued on) under the light for almost ten minutes with no change from when I had painted them. The lightbulbs where difficult to put in and one of them did not even work. This is a poor product and was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Easy to use.  Dries my nails in 120 seconds.  Have seen many more expensive units out there.  This one is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> I do nails A LOT. I love this lamp however, nail chemicals will destroy the top of this device. I tend to do my clients nails I top of the lamp and even the slightest spill will stay forever. Other than that, the lamp works great!!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it should. More economical than going to the salon. In fact, looks just like the one at the salon I used to go to!</li>
    <li> Works great. I cant tell the difference from what the nail salon do and what i do to my nails. I love it. Great product.</li>
    <li> came packaged great! so far I haven&#x27;t tried it but i did plug it in and seems to work. so buy if you are in need of one.</li>
    <li> works great! bought this for my 15 yr old who has acquired a knack for creating some pretty fabulous nail art. She absolutely loves this light.</li>
    <li> The unit did not work.  The bulbs were in securely but it would not turn on. My husband checked it out and it still wouldn&#x27;t work. Returned the product. However, the shipping was quick as was the refund.</li>
    <li> No problems whatsoever, I don&#x27;t know how long the bulbs will last, but it&#x27;s working perfectly months later! I would order again as a gift.</li>
    <li> I use this with ibd gel polish and it works fantastic! The cute pink color is also a plus :)</li>
    <li> This lamp works great and dries my gel nails like it should.  I don&#x27;t spend so much time and money getting my nails done some place else.  I can backfill what&#x27;s already been done and make my nail job last longer.</li>
    <li> Received this product extremly fast. Everything works properly, overwell I am sastified with this product! I would recommed it to new beginners because it is extremely easy and fun to use.</li>
    <li> UV Lamp works great--no issues to date.  I choose this one due to free shipping and I found where I can get replacement bulbs, when needed.  The lamp was larger than I expected and the box indicated dark pink not purple as shown on Salon Supply Store (seller) advertisement; minor issues.  I use the lamp for curing Shellac topcoat, I also wear UV blocking gloves, a personal choice for peace of mind.</li>
    <li> Works great so far. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now I believe and it works great everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> i bought this because it is pink and 36W. I placed the order on 17th and it arrived at 29th. it takes too long for me. Its easy to put the bulbs in and it does a great job on nails. Dry fast!</li>
    <li> I would rather go to the salon to get them done...this item does not work like one would think... hello</li>
    <li> This purchase made my day!! I have done 2 sets of gel nails so far and it works great :)&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it to dry nail polish faster. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Had to get this because I accidentally purchased UV gel polish instead of LED polish. I wanted a good quality 36W lamp for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back metal insides bent a little while I was putting the lamp bulbs in, so I&#x27;d have to say that the set up was a bit awkward. They did snap in ok after a few tries. The bottom sliding shelf comes out completely which is nice for when you change the bulbs or have to clean up any smudges. The shiny blue liner wasn&#x27;t glued down well to the shelf so whenever I put my hands in, I wound up getting caught on the edges and pulling it up more. I&#x27;ll have to either take it off or re-glue it down with crazy glue or something. The size of this thing is HUGE compared to my little LED lamp. You can actually put your hand right up to your wrist into this thing! ( I have the Sensationail pro 3060 LED lamp, it&#x27;s only a few inches deep so only your fingertips go in ) Not sure if that&#x27;s a good or bad point, just I wasn&#x27;t expecting the huge size. The pink color looked exactly like the pictures; a nice dark raspberry color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual performance, it work just fine. There is a switch on the back that lets you either time 120 seconds or let the light run non-stop. I always leave it on timer because I&#x27;m terrible with time and don&#x27;t want to under or over-cure my nails. I&#x27;ve used a few gel types in here and they all cured well: I&#x27;ve used both UV and LED polishes like Gelish, EZ Flow, Canni, and another &amp;#34;unmarked&amp;#34; brand UV polish. You need about 2 times at the 120 second interval to cure darker polishes. I&#x27;ve been fine with 1 interval for very light or clear coats. It depends on the polish, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not perfect, but good price with fast shipping, so I&#x27;m pretty happy!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect lamp for my shellac nail polishes!  I love it!  Works exactly how it should.  I thought about buying a more reasonably priced UV lamp, but the wattage was less and I was afraid it would not cure my nails in the correct amount of time.  I am very happy I purchased this!</li>
    <li> Super cute. Perfect light</li>
