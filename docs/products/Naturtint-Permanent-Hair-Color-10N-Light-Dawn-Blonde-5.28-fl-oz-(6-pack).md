      <li>Price and how fast it arrived.</li>
      <li>I just love this product and bought if for such a low price here that I recommended it to all my family who use grocery store dyes.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product to those wanting to get the results they expect when reading color chart.</li>
      <li>it smells like wet cardboard and a mild cat piss order (but that is my opinion)....</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for every person who is looking for natural hair color.</li>
      <li>I am a naturally &amp;#34;dishwater&amp;#34</li>
      <li>when mixed, it looks like clear, tan jelly.</li>
