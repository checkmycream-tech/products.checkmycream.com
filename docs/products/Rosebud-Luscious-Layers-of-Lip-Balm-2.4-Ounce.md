### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I never thought I would say this, but - this is the best lip balm I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The brambleberry is the best of the three, fruity without being overly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
      <li>Wonderful product!</li>
      <li>Great value, excellent products.</li>
      <li>It feels great, but the smell isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
      <li>It has a great scent.</li>
      <li>The mocha rose smells wonderful, like a blend of chocolate</li>
      <li>great value--I buy as gifts for all my daughter&#x27;s friends.</li>
      <li>I love this set!!</li>
      <li>:) Very happy with my purchase!</li>
      <li>Loving it!</li>
      <li>Mocha Rose is the yummiest flavor of milk chocolate, I just keep piling it on!</li>
      <li>I just love Rosebud Salve, that&#x27;s why I bought three of them!</li>
      <li>I prefer strawberry as it&#x27;s my favorite, but these scents are nice too!</li>
      <li>Cute package but the original rosebud flavor is the best!  </li>
      <li>you receive is a mocha rose balm, a brambleberry rose balm and a menthol eucalyptus balm.</li>
      <li>and I think it really is the best care product for the lips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It actually kind of gave me a headache</li>
      <li>but the brumbleberry rose</li>
      <li>I love Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve, so I bought this three-pack thinking it was as pictured in the product photo (i.e., Rosebud Salve, Strawberry, and Minted Rose).  </li>
      <li>also noticed that the quality of the tins weren&#x27;t as good athe tins in the original trio.</li>
      <li>He liked the original Rosebud Balm I had, but didn&#x27;t want any of that sweet flowery flavor, so he is happy with it as well.</li>
      <li>the trio with the original flavors (strawberry, minted rose, and rose).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and very light, not sticky at all.</li>
      <li>am giving the product four stars, because they have that same great texture with just the right amount of petroleum jelly and emollient oils, and because I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re perfect if you&#x27;re looking for a sweeter (think candied) version of Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve.  </li>
      <li>I so wanted to love this product -</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the &amp;#34;brambleberry rose&amp;#34; scent, once I sniffed it</li>
      <li>I went for this lip balm trio after purchasing (and falling in love with)</li>
      <li>It has a light, pleasant smell, pretty color, it goes on very smoothly, and the retro-tins are just cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they are more easily malleable.</li>
      <li>There were three lip balm tins inside, the menthol is my favorite to use first thing in the morning, very refreshing.</li>
      <li>My 83 year old aunt sold it and got a 22 rifle lol.</li>
      <li>the menthol and eucalyptus is also very good however you do not feel the menthol for too long.</li>
      <li>I ended up getting sickly sweet smelling lip balms instead of the lovely advertised ones.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t finish my first \\&quot;can\\&quot; of product when I ordered this amazing kit full of flavors on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the Menthol Eucalyptus so much, but it has kind of a Vicks VapoRub Lite sort of vibe to</li>
      <li>You can get 4 for 20 buck&#x27;s at amazon.com free shipping,but I have a prime membership.</li>
      <li>three-pack that&#x27;s pictured in the product photo is available elsewhere on Amazon:</li>
      <li>It contains three different types of lip balm Mocha rose, brumbleberry rose and menthol and eucalyptus.</li>
      <li>Like the brambleberry rose, I felt like the scent on this mocha one was also much stronger than any of the rose/strawberry ones in the original trio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But one of these has too strong and sweet smell.</li>
      <li>nice large package, and leave my lips super</li>
      <li>but also of course to help anyone who loves the original trio and is thinking about trying this one out.</li>
      <li>It smells unique like roses.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best lip balms i have ever used.i will definitely come back for more..</li>
      <li>I wanted the three lip balms and tin that was shown in the picture (with the original formula).  </li>
      <li>What I received was three-pack which includes three other Smith&#x27;s balms, namely Mocha Rose, Brambleberry Rose, and Menthol Eucalyptus.  </li>
      <li>these balms are good for the price you buy them for as in other stores they would be sold for more</li>
      <li>There were really no notes of rose, and the berry scent was also quite strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, personally, I&#x27;m really not crazy about the scents.  </li>
      <li>Brambleberry Rose is now a close second!</li>
      <li>The larger tin is attractive enough to be left out in my bathroom, it&#x27;s good for storage.</li>
      <li>The original scent/flavor is my personal favorite.</li>
      <li>The Mocha Rose and Brambleberry are both sickly sweet for my tastes, and slightly stickier.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy their other tin more.</li>
      <li>Even then, the corners of my mouth still feel dry after application, and the tin is so smooth it easily slips to the floor.</li>
      <li>me tell you that I bought my first product on Sephora and it was in the rose-mint flavor.</li>
      <li>This keeps my lips soft, smooth and moisturized for hours on end.</li>
      <li>It came in the cute tin as pictured with three different balms as described.  </li>
      <li>have ever worked for me at keeping my lips soft for more then 30 minutes so far.</li>
      <li>:) I think I will order the Minted Rose next, it&#x27;s not easy to find in a store here.</li>
      <li>It may be for you if strong scents are not a big deal!</li>
      <li>The tins are quite large.</li>
      <li>I did not get the Mocha Rose and other flavors in picture on main page when you order.  </li>
      <li>reason for three stars is that if used only at night it does a fine job.</li>
      <li>has a very strong almost sour odor that i guess some people would like</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>Much to my dismay, this trio of flavors just didn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>its &amp;#34;with vanilla,&amp;#34; but I really didn&#x27;t get any of that.</li>
      <li>Also, the tins are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I think anyone who likes that will really like this.</li>
      <li>The mocha rose looked blotchy and appeared to have tiny crystallized residues on the balm surface, and similarly the eucalyptus also appeared to be discolored and patchy on the surface.</li>
      <li>mocha rose was less pungent of a sweetness, but the chocolate scent was clear</li>
      <li>if left out in the sun or heat too long, it melts very easily and can ruin your purse, carpet etc.</li>
      <li>The item came in a cute little tin can which makes it very easy to use as a small gift.</li>
      <li>You get 3 round tins inside this cute tin box.</li>
      <li>I will say though that another big reason I ended up returning them and not even trying to give them away was because something about the balms just didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
      <li>I expected the mocha, eucalyptus etc and got the strawberry, original and mint</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive lips and have found that these Smith lip balms are all I can use aside from petroleum jelly.  </li>
      <li>eucalyptus one was probably the one whose scent was least irksome to me, and again it was pretty strong.</li>
      <li>use this product before I get to sleep, so my lips look soft and moistured in the morning.</li>
      <li>The above email address is where I sent the hundred or so dollars worth of lip and hand and foot cremes for Female Marines in Afghanistan.</li>
      <li>but i do not think that i would buy this item again as i have tried other products that were far better for less.</li>
      <li>It was actually really overpowering for me, and as much as I hate to describe something as &amp;#34;sickly&amp;#34;, for me the brambleberry rose was a distinctly &amp;#34;sickly sweet&amp;#34; scent.</li>
      <li>We only pay to ship them to either San Francisco or to New York.</li>

<li> The mocha rose is odd, reminds me of a stale tootsie roll.</li>
<li> I am a lip balm junkie and have tried alot of different lip products and only the rosebud perfume co balms &amp; one other brand</li>
<li> I got a completely different tin with three different kinds that are really strong and have an unpleasant smell.  </li>
<li> Lastly, my husband won&#x27;t kiss me while I&#x27;m wearing it due to the \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; factor.&lt;br</li>
<li> May cause lips to dry out</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a result of &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34; or too old balms but either way I wasn&#x27;t looking to take a risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> My lips are not specially conditioned because they call for lip treatment of some sort in short order.</li>
<li> The menthol &amp; eucalyptus is severely lacking, not &amp;#34;aromatic and exhilarating&amp;#34; as promised on the Rosebud Perfume website, but did ok using them on a bad case of chapped hands.</li>
<li> Not much else to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t end up trying any of them on because I knew I was going to return them from the scents, so</li>
<li> I usually purchase the strawberry balm from Sephora for ten dollars a tin!</li>
<li> I am a little disappointed with this trio as I feel the scent &amp; flavor of all three aren&#x27;t as strong as the lavish layers, and fear they have been sitting on a shelf somewhere a bit too long before being sold to me.</li>
<li> Its just the caps on them it very sharp when i take it off.</li>
<li> usually don&#x27;t post reviews, but I had been so looking forward to this trio and so disappointed after getting it that I decided I&#x27;d do a review, mostly to keep myself from buying it again</li>
<li> Yes I do have to reapply a little after eating or drinking</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wanted the three lip balms and tin that was shown in the picture (with the original formula).  I got a completely different tin with three different kinds that are really strong and have an unpleasant smell.  A little bit disappointed that it was not the same as the picture that was advertised.  I notice now that the picture has been updated.</li>
    <li> Cute package but the original rosebud flavor is the best!  Not really a big fan for any of these favors...</li>
    <li> The item came in a cute little tin can which makes it very easy to use as a small gift. It contains three different types of lip balm Mocha rose, brumbleberry rose and menthol and eucalyptus. The mocha rose smells wonderful, like a blend of chocolate but the brumbleberry rose has a very strong almost sour odor that i guess some people would like but personally i did not like at all. the menthol and eucalyptus is also very good however you do not feel the menthol for too long. Overall, these products are a hyped up version of vaseline with some scent added to them. if left out in the sun or heat too long, it melts very easily and can ruin your purse, carpet etc. The picture online makes it seem as if they are selling you the strawberry scented version instead of the menthol eucalyptus as well which i found to be a bit misleading....these balms are good for the price you buy them for as in other stores they would be sold for more but i do not think that i would buy this item again as i have tried other products that were far better for less.</li>
    <li> It feels great, but the smell isn&#x27;t the best. I enjoy their other tin more.</li>
    <li> I saw this product in various magazines, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you that I bought my first product on Sephora and it was in the rose-mint flavor. I tried it and I think it really is the best care product for the lips.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t finish my first \\&quot;can\\&quot; of product when I ordered this amazing kit full of flavors on Amazon. All the flavors are exquisit.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product before I get to sleep, so my lips look soft and moistured in the morning.</li>
    <li> I did not get the Mocha Rose and other flavors in picture on main page when you order.  Very disappointing, I would like to return or get the right product shipped to me ASAP.  SOS?</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed to see that what I thought I bought wasn&#x27;t what I got. The picture is incorrect. I ended up getting sickly sweet smelling lip balms instead of the lovely advertised ones. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The above email address is where I sent the hundred or so dollars worth of lip and hand and foot cremes for Female Marines in Afghanistan. Yes, our Prez has sent women to a place where there is shooting, but the women are not allowed to shoot until 2016. So, what are they doing? Baking cookies? They need the lip blams and the tampons and the pads and the Blistex and any personal hygeine items we would buy for ourselves. We only pay to ship them to either San Francisco or to New York. Now, who has a few bucks to send some things women need in Afghanistan? My Dad was a Marine, he was a POW as well, and I think the least I can do is help out some soldiers now and again. Anysoldier.com will give you the info for what the women (they give you their names so you can write!)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and very light, not sticky at all. It had the Menthol and Eucalyptus one included, which I got for my husband. He liked the original Rosebud Balm I had, but didn&#x27;t want any of that sweet flowery flavor, so he is happy with it as well. Brambleberry is a bit hard candy like, but not too bad. Mocha Rose is the yummiest flavor of milk chocolate, I just keep piling it on! :) I think I will order the Minted Rose next, it&#x27;s not easy to find in a store here.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have very sensitive lips and have found that these Smith lip balms are all I can use aside from petroleum jelly.  I love this set!! It came in the cute tin as pictured with three different balms as described.  The value is unbeatable!  I usually purchase the strawberry balm from Sephora for ten dollars a tin! In this set you are getting three for a little over sixteen!  I prefer strawberry as it&#x27;s my favorite, but these scents are nice too! Brambleberry Rose is now a close second! :) Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve, so I bought this three-pack thinking it was as pictured in the product photo (i.e., Rosebud Salve, Strawberry, and Minted Rose).  What I received was three-pack which includes three other Smith&#x27;s balms, namely Mocha Rose, Brambleberry Rose, and Menthol Eucalyptus.  I checked the product page again, and realized that the Product Description is correct, even though the image isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the product four stars, because they have that same great texture with just the right amount of petroleum jelly and emollient oils, and because I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re perfect if you&#x27;re looking for a sweeter (think candied) version of Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve.  Also, the tins are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, personally, I&#x27;m really not crazy about the scents.  The Mocha Rose and Brambleberry are both sickly sweet for my tastes, and slightly stickier.  I don&#x27;t mind the Menthol Eucalyptus so much, but it has kind of a Vicks VapoRub Lite sort of vibe to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three-pack that&#x27;s pictured in the product photo is available elsewhere on Amazon: [[ASIN:B002HTREHE Rosebud StackLavish Layers (Salve, Mint &amp; Strawberry in .8oz Tin each)]].</li>
    <li> I just love Rosebud Salve, that&#x27;s why I bought three of them! But one of these has too strong and sweet smell. I prefer the traditional/original one and would rather have bought three of them.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed with this trio as I feel the scent &amp; flavor of all three aren&#x27;t as strong as the lavish layers, and fear they have been sitting on a shelf somewhere a bit too long before being sold to me. The mocha rose is odd, reminds me of a stale tootsie roll. The menthol &amp; eucalyptus is severely lacking, not &amp;#34;aromatic and exhilarating&amp;#34; as promised on the Rosebud Perfume website, but did ok using them on a bad case of chapped hands. The brambleberry is the best of the three, fruity without being overly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Got these to try, but definitely won&#x27;t be buying again (or anything from the seller I purchased from).</li>
    <li> great value--I buy as gifts for all my daughter&#x27;s friends.</li>
    <li> You can get 4 for 20 buck&#x27;s at amazon.com free shipping,but I have a prime membership.Same tin can and salve since it was started 100 year&#x27;s ago. Made from cotton seed oil plus secret recipe.My 83 year old aunt sold it and got a 22 rifle lol.</li>
    <li> nice large package, and leave my lips super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it a 4 because the mint one I got smells like vicks vapo rub.</li>
    <li> I went for this lip balm trio after purchasing (and falling in love with) the trio with the original flavors (strawberry, minted rose, and rose). Much to my dismay, this trio of flavors just didn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the &amp;#34;brambleberry rose&amp;#34; scent, once I sniffed it I knew this was definitely BERRY. There were really no notes of rose, and the berry scent was also quite strong. It was actually really overpowering for me, and as much as I hate to describe something as &amp;#34;sickly&amp;#34;, for me the brambleberry rose was a distinctly &amp;#34;sickly sweet&amp;#34; scent. It actually kind of gave me a headache so there wasn&#x27;t any way for me to just ignore the scent and use it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mocha rose was less pungent of a sweetness, but the chocolate scent was clear and I think anyone who likes that will really like this. Unfortunately, that wasn&#x27;t me! I think they mentioned that its &amp;#34;with vanilla,&amp;#34; but I really didn&#x27;t get any of that. Like the brambleberry rose, I felt like the scent on this mocha one was also much stronger than any of the rose/strawberry ones in the original trio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eucalyptus one was probably the one whose scent was least irksome to me, and again it was pretty strong. Not much else to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t end up trying any of them on because I knew I was going to return them from the scents, so I can&#x27;t say anything about the consistencies-- I will say though that another big reason I ended up returning them and not even trying to give them away was because something about the balms just didn&#x27;t seem right. The mocha rose looked blotchy and appeared to have tiny crystallized residues on the balm surface, and similarly the eucalyptus also appeared to be discolored and patchy on the surface. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a result of &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34; or too old balms but either way I wasn&#x27;t looking to take a risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the quality of the tins weren&#x27;t as good athe tins in the original trio. The tins in this trio seem thinner and are more difficult to place back on or take off because of they are more easily malleable. (Hard to explain--but if you do the comparison I think you&#x27;d know what I&#x27;m talking about!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t post reviews, but I had been so looking forward to this trio and so disappointed after getting it that I decided I&#x27;d do a review, mostly to keep myself from buying it again haha but also of course to help anyone who loves the original trio and is thinking about trying this one out. It may be for you if strong scents are not a big deal!</li>
    <li> It is an all in one lip balm that can be used not only for your lips.  You can use it on your elbows or your hands for patchy skin. You can use it to moisturize your cuticles. It has a great scent.</li>
    <li> WARNING:  the product in the picture listed is not accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I had read thru the reviews and knew this prior to purchase)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you receive is a mocha rose balm, a brambleberry rose balm and a menthol eucalyptus balm. I absolutely love this stuff. I am a lip balm junkie and have tried alot of different lip products and only the rosebud perfume co balms &amp; one other brand have ever worked for me at keeping my lips soft for more then 30 minutes so far. This keeps my lips soft, smooth and moisturized for hours on end. Yes I do have to reapply a little after eating or drinking but I haven&#x27;t come across a product that stays on 100% after eating or drinking. However it doesn&#x27;t go away to entirely after eating but enough that I feel I need another application. I would definately recommend this to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post pictures so consumers can see what they are actually buying</li>
    <li> May cause lips to dry out</li>
    <li> This product does not disappoint! Just one tin provides a lot of gloss and has lasted me a few months. The original scent/flavor is my personal favorite.</li>
    <li> Great value, excellent products.You get 3 round tins inside this cute tin box.</li>
    <li> I so wanted to love this product - It has a light, pleasant smell, pretty color, it goes on very smoothly, and the retro-tins are just cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me this product does not last. I find myself re-applying it over and over. Even then, the corners of my mouth still feel dry after application, and the tin is so smooth it easily slips to the floor. Lastly, my husband won&#x27;t kiss me while I&#x27;m wearing it due to the \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for three stars is that if used only at night it does a fine job. I can kiss my husband, goop up, and it lasts the night through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the next morning everything starts over again. My lips are not specially conditioned because they call for lip treatment of some sort in short order. If using this product, the application, re-application lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Loving it! This is one of the best lip balms i have ever used.i will definitely come back for more..</li>
    <li> I keep this in my purse. It smells unique like roses. I use it for my hands and lips. The tins are quite large.</li>
    <li> I received this today, and I like the look of the tin. There were three lip balm tins inside, the menthol is my favorite to use first thing in the morning, very refreshing. The larger tin is attractive enough to be left out in my bathroom, it&#x27;s good for storage.</li>
    <li> I have no problems with the lip balms i like them all. Its just the caps on them it very sharp when i take it off.</li>
    <li> I expected the mocha, eucalyptus etc and got the strawberry, original and mint</li>
    <li> I never thought I would say this, but - this is the best lip balm I have ever used. I will never give it up!</li>
