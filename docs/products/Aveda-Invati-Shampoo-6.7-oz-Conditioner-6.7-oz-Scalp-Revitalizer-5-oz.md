      <li>It smells great and the shampoo in particular leaves your hair feeling super clean.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length, light brown, fine hair with no volume.</li>
      <li>My hair stoped falling out the smell is amazing and my hair feels so much healthier.</li>
      <li>I have light blond hair, and it has made it darker.  </li>
      <li>I bought two full sets for $116 each on the Aveda site (with free shipping).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and was happy to find it at a lower price than the Salon.</li>
      <li>Thanks to my Aveda hair dresser and these products, my very fine hair is the longest and thickest I&#x27;ve had it in 15-20 years.</li>
      <li>it fades quickly.</li>
      <li>naturally curly but straiten daily (or every other).The smell is great.</li>
      <li>This feels really fresh.</li>
      <li>I did this at first, but decided to concentrate on areas</li>
      <li>First off, BUY ON THE AVEDA WEBSITE or AT AVEDA SALON..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different products; however this product, if you follow the directions DOES work.</li>
      <li>hair growth by the end of the first week.</li>
      <li>I have consistently used their products over the years.</li>
      <li>I can say that the shampoo and conditioner are not bad as it gives me a little volume, but there are many other good volumizing shampoos out there at cheaper price.</li>
      <li>The spray is the most expensive, and will take more than a month to see it&#x27;s true effects.</li>
      <li>It is problably too early to tell how it will perform over the long run, but so far so good..</li>
      <li>It has a nice herbal smell to it, a little bit medicinal, but does not leave that smell upon drying.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product from an Aveda shop in Washington and find that it really works.</li>
      <li>I can really tell the difference since using this product whic I have been using for about a year now.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After spending so much money on this and reading reviews I really thought this product would work.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>DO NOT USE if you have fine, dry or damaged</li>
      <li>I have notice less hairs  in the shower and the counter top after showers and my hair appears fuller, although I believe the product is also designed to add fullness and body to hair.  </li>
      <li>I do not have pattern baldness, but I have always had nice thick hair</li>
      <li>My hair is thicker and after about 3 months from beginning to use the system I saw new, baby hair coming in.  </li>
      <li>I usually run out of the scalp revitalizer and don&#x27;t buy more until I run out of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Wow..</li>
      <li>This really works, literally brought hair back but use all three.</li>
      <li>I bought it because I am an olde middle aged male and my hair has been thinning more noticeably over the last couple of years.  </li>
      <li>After using this system for a year, I wanted to save money and thought I would stop and go back to normal Aveda Shampure.  </li>
      <li>I tried it through the first set and saw absolutely no difference.  </li>
      <li>Def gives you volume, so I really only use it on my roots to \\&quot;thicken\\&quot;, as it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft and silky, so I substitute with another conditioner on the ends.</li>
      <li>At first I saw all the growth and initially was worried that they were broken, shorter, damaged hair, but looked closer, and I was amazed it was all new growth!  </li>

<li> My hair feels healthy and thick and I am also taking biotin everyday.</li>
<li> The only reason I will use it that long is because of the price.</li>
<li> that I can actually leave my hair to air dry without frizz..</li>
<li> My hair feels soft and manageable, and I bought the product hoping my hair would get thicker, hair loss would be less, and the thinning would improve.  </li>
<li> It is extremely expensive, which would be fine if it works.  </li>
<li> I have medium to long hair that is highlighted;</li>
<li> It also sort of makes me feel like my hair is dry.  </li>
<li> It has been 2 weeks now and still the same results..weighed down, greasy hair.</li>
<li> First of all, it really smells bad.  </li>
<li> I was hesitant to buy it because of the price, but I only use a very small amount of the products each application so it should last 2-3 months.  </li>
<li> I am going to try it every other time</li>
<li> It volumizes my hair without me trying to use other volumizing mousse or spray.</li>
<li> I am going to stick with it unless results prove other than I am seeing now.</li>
<li> I also use the Kerastase Specifique Stimuliste Nutri Energising Daily Anti-Hairloss Spray after shampoo to get that full volume effect, you cant go wrong with Kerastase !!</li>
<li> That is my only complaint-</li>
<li> After using this 3 step system, all it did was weigh my hair down with a greasy buildup.</li>
<li> less hair on the comb, brush, floor and shower.</li>
<li> I seem to be losing a little less hair.</li>
<li> Been using the products religiously for 2 months and have not really seen any dramatic results.</li>
<li> My hair looks even thinner now since it is weighed down my this product!</li>
<li> I noticed a difference within just a few weeks of using this product.</li>
<li> For a few months I didn&#x27;t use the system.  </li>
<li> Bottom line, it didn&#x27;t work for me, it is very overpriced and it smells bad.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m still not sure why people buy this product on Amazon.  </li>
<li> I tried applying small amount of it to help, but it still remained greasy and with no volume at all.</li>
<li> and my hair seems healthier - not sure about the thickness yet as my hair has been processed (color and highlights) for years</li>
<li> People please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, very disappointed and especially that the price is not cheap.</li>
<li> or &amp;#34;growing hair&amp;#34; as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I would not wish this upon anyone- to have them spend upwards of $115 just to make your hair look worse than before.</li>
<li> I am 42 and my hair is thinning, although it&#x27;s always been thin.</li>
<li> My hair has begin to thin from age and surgery.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
<li> Even my kids tell me my hair stinks when they hug me.</li>
<li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t say that on the bottle!  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
<li> Extremely disappointed!</li>
<li> Smells AWFUL!  </li>
<li> Just awful!</li>

    <li> Wow..hair growth by the end of the first week. Thicker hair too! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair has begin to thin from age and surgery. I can really tell the difference since using this product whic I have been using for about a year now.</li>
    <li> wife loves the product&lt;br /&gt;arrived on time</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference within just a few weeks of using this product. My hair stopped falling out and is getting noticably thicker. I&#x27;ve used so many different products; however this product, if you follow the directions DOES work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products about 8 months and they are great! Hair is appearing thicker and more healthy!</li>
    <li> I have been going to Aveda salons for about 6 years. I have consistently used their products over the years. Invati is a good product. I have used it for about 1 month now. I have medium to long hair that is highlighted; naturally curly but straiten daily (or every other).The smell is great. The shampoo is fantastic! No issues there. The conditioner is okay. Def gives you volume, so I really only use it on my roots to \\&quot;thicken\\&quot;, as it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft and silky, so I substitute with another conditioner on the ends. The spray is the most expensive, and will take more than a month to see it&#x27;s true effects. I will say it smells wonderful. My stylist told me to spray 8 sprays on each side of my scalp. I did this at first, but decided to concentrate on areas whereI wanted my hair to grow in thicker. Then, you rub it into your scalp. This feels really fresh. Love the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy this again, and plan to ride it out to see where it goes. My hair is not shedding as much, which has been awesome! If you have the $ to invest in your hair, I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
    <li> Been using the products religiously for 2 months and have not really seen any dramatic results. Maybe I just need to give it more time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and so far, I am happy  with the results.  I bought it because I am an olde middle aged male and my hair has been thinning more noticeably over the last couple of years.  I do not have pattern baldness, but I have always had nice thick hair and I was concerned that it was thinning out and my scalp was becoming more visible.&lt;br /&gt;  It is problably too early to tell how it will perform over the long run, but so far so good..

    <li> I used up the invati scalp revitalizer with shampoo and conditioner. People please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, very disappointed and especially that the price is not cheap. My hair started to fall out even more than in the beginning of use with aveda scalp revitalizer. I can say that the shampoo and conditioner are not bad as it gives me a little volume, but there are many other good volumizing shampoos out there at cheaper price. I ended up switching to Kerastase cure intensive antichute for scalp treatment of thinning hair, and what a difference. My hair stoped falling out the smell is amazing and my hair feels so much healthier.I also use the Kerastase Specifique Stimuliste Nutri Energising Daily Anti-Hairloss Spray after shampoo to get that full volume effect, you cant go wrong with Kerastase !!</li>
    <li> Hair has grown and so have my nails.</li>
    <li> I love all things Aveda!</li>
    <li> This really works, literally brought hair back but use all three. Thanks to my Aveda hair dresser and these products, my very fine hair is the longest and thickest I&#x27;ve had it in 15-20 years.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveda Invati Shampoo and conditioners for awhile now. It has restored alot of my hair. My hair dresser says my hair is looking great.  I love all 3 Invati products.</li>
    <li> I have only had a chance to use it for 3 weeks.  My hair feels soft and manageable, and I bought the product hoping my hair would get thicker, hair loss would be less, and the thinning would improve.  I have not noticed an improvement there yet (to the naked eye) but am hoping to see improvement soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not sure why people buy this product on Amazon.  I bought two full sets for $116 each on the Aveda site (with free shipping).  It is extremely expensive, which would be fine if it works.  I tried it through the first set and saw absolutely no difference.  I decided to try another set since I figured it would take some time to start working.  First of all, it really smells bad.  Since you are suppose to use the scalp revitalizer every day, the smell is constantly in your hair.  I have light blond hair, and it has made it darker.  I&#x27;ve been told you should only use the shampoo on your scalp and use a different shampoo on the rest of your hair.  Too bad it doesn&#x27;t say that on the bottle!  Bottom line, it didn&#x27;t work for me, it is very overpriced and it smells bad.  Extremely disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and was happy to find it at a lower price than the Salon.</li>
    <li> have seen a big improvement.  less hair on the comb, brush, floor and shower. A product that does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I am 42 and my hair is thinning, although it&#x27;s always been thin. Anyway I tried this and it&#x27;s awesome! It volumizes my hair without me trying to use other volumizing mousse or spray. This makes my hair feel great&#x27; I love it but it&#x27;s so expensive. I am going to try it every other time so I don&#x27;t use too much. That is my only complaint- the price!! Overall very good results. My hair feels healthy and thick and I am also taking biotin everyday. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! I will say that the spray it comes with makes my hair greasy the second day, but then again I have oily scalp. I like this but I will not be buying too often because of price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from an Aveda shop in Washington and find that it really works. It smells great and the shampoo in particular leaves your hair feeling super clean.</li>
    <li> Smells AWFUL!  It smells just like a dogs flea shampoo.  Just awful! The bottle says that it is a 30 day supply and I will give it that lets hope we see some results.  The only reason I will use it that long is because of the price. Even my kids tell me my hair stinks when they hug me. Will NEVER buy this product again just on smell alone.</li>
    <li> Works well. I seem to be losing a little less hair.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE if you have fine, dry or damaged hair!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending so much money on this and reading reviews I really thought this product would work.&lt;br /&gt; I have shoulder length, light brown, fine hair with no volume. After using this 3 step system, all it did was weigh my hair down with a greasy buildup. I tried applying small amount of it to help, but it still remained greasy and with no volume at all. I tried avoiding the scalp- still greasy.  My hair looks even thinner now since it is weighed down my this product! It has been 2 weeks now and still the same results..weighed down, greasy hair. No shine or luster. No &amp;#34;thicker hair&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;growing hair&amp;#34; as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I would not wish this upon anyone- to have them spend upwards of $115 just to make your hair look worse than before.</li>
    <li> I have used this system for a couple years and it works.  I usually run out of the scalp revitalizer and don&#x27;t buy more until I run out of shampoo and conditioner.  Even just using the shampoo and conditioner, I have results.  My hair is thicker and after about 3 months from beginning to use the system I saw new, baby hair coming in.  At that time the baby hair was noticeable when blow drying my hair.  At first I saw all the growth and initially was worried that they were broken, shorter, damaged hair, but looked closer, and I was amazed it was all new growth!  After using this system for a year, I wanted to save money and thought I would stop and go back to normal Aveda Shampure.  For a few months I didn&#x27;t use the system.  I started noticing hair in my shower drain and hair brush.  I started shedding a lot!  I got back on the system and the shedding stopped.  Now I have more baby hair growing in. This product works for me.  I will stick with it.  To note, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds up big time.  It also sort of makes me feel like my hair is dry.  To combat that, I use conditioning treatments occasionally and leave conditioner on my hair longer.</li>
    <li> First off, BUY ON THE AVEDA WEBSITE or AT AVEDA SALON.. same kit (same size bottles) are only $110.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this kit for about a week now and my hair seems healthier - not sure about the thickness yet as my hair has been processed (color and highlights) for years and I am sure one week it not enough time to see results, but definitely softer and smoother that I can actually leave my hair to air dry without frizz.. a bit of a strong smell but doesnt bother me.. it fades quickly.</li>
