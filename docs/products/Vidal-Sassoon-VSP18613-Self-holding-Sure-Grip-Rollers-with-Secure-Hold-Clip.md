      <li>/&gt;It was worth it though!!</li>
      <li>A great investment as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>

      <li>Not that great, expected more from reviews.</li>
      <li>Great just wish they had more of the bigger rollers vs so many of the smaller rollers.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special at all about these.</li>
      <li>They are well made and if you have thin hair these will probably be perfect for you.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use, do not harm my fine hair, and doesn&#x27;t take long to set.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>At first I thought that having the clips attached to the roller was simply convenient, then I realized it was also keeps the roller in place better if you clip the roller on the opposite side to where the elastic thread is attached.  </li>
      <li>I only wish there were more larger sizes</li>
      <li>Most likely will discard and look for a different style!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
      <li>Bought clips to use in the new velcro rollers and they work like a charm.</li>
      <li>I liked these because they came with a clip the velcrow stuff can kind of make it a little difficult to get out of your hair</li>
      <li>I have short hair, so there was not an issue with entanglement, but I also found that they won&#x27;t hold very well without the clip.  </li>
      <li>Needs more small rollers!  </li>

<li> Needs more small rollers!  </li>
<li> So if your hair is long you may want to purchase bigger rollers separately.</li>
<li> You would get the same results from a roll of Velcro!&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of how little hair you roll in them, it gets caught in the roller.</li>
<li> it did not curl as expected.</li>
<li> These rollers pulled at my hair just like any other brand.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used them alot, due to lack of time</li>
<li> I am having to leave the roller in my hair with the clip hanging down because the clip will not hold.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t really like the clips in the first place as they are difficult to put into the roller at the base, even when one tries it from the opposite side on which the clip is fastened.  </li>
<li> If you have thick long hair like me DONT get these.</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t always want a tight curl.</li>
<li> Took me a little while to figure out which sizes to use on which parts of the hair.</li>
<li> The velcro may be a little softer than usual, but I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase again just for this reason.</li>
<li> usually wash my hair in the night and put this rollers on my damp hair.</li>
<li> but duh.</li>
<li> and I have just cut off broken clips and use metal ones.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sorry this product failed my expectation.  </li>
<li> and I had an awful time unrolling it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> This product was horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to do.. I put them in my damp hair, went to sleep, took them out in the morning and oh man was there volume and curls. I&#x27;m not an expert on curlers at all but they are a very uncomplicated thing to use. I liked these because they came with a clip the velcrow stuff can kind of make it a little difficult to get out of your hair but duh.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great travel set of rollers, this is it! I love that the clips are attached! I only wish there were more larger sizes but I made do. Great volume from this product as well. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely brilliant. Gives great style without any heat. Takes a lot longer though. If you have 6-7 hours before you want to go out this will help you give a perfect style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair in the night and put this rollers on my damp hair. I keep them overnight. gives beautiful bouncy curves. Took me a little while to figure out which sizes to use on which parts of the hair. Direction of rolling is also very important. I would suggest to use a hair mousse before you put the rollers to hold the curls in place. I have tried using hair spray but it takes away the bounce. And the last thing....DO NOT brush your curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product. Great results for that price.</li>
    <li> The concept is awesome and they are good quality, however, they rip your hair out of your head and tangle the hair around the roller as you take them out!</li>
    <li> These work nicely to give my hair style.  They are easy to use, do not harm my fine hair, and doesn&#x27;t take long to set.</li>
    <li> easy to work and I like the attached clips comes handy</li>
    <li> Worked really well on my 2c/3a type hair (see naturallycurly.com for hair types).</li>
    <li> The clips attached to each roller only lasted about a year.  I like the rollers themselves and I have just cut off broken clips and use metal ones.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Self holding rollers are much easier to use than traditional ones, the velcro-type material grabs all of your hair, even if it is different lengths, and doesn&#x27;t allow for any runaways.&lt;br /&gt;The attached clip is very handy, you won&#x27;t ever lose them and you don&#x27;t have to fumble around looking for one when you are putting your hair up.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that there weren&#x27;t enough, so I had to order 2 sets.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth it though!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grand daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Not that great, expected more from reviews. Flimsy and dioesnt give good curls in hair. Very diusatyified with this product.</li>
    <li> I like these rollers. Haven&#x27;t used them alot, due to lack of time but I would recommend them to anyone interested</li>
    <li> Great just wish they had more of the bigger rollers vs so many of the smaller rollers.  So if your hair is long you may want to purchase bigger rollers separately. They do their job but I don&#x27;t always want a tight curl.</li>
    <li> These rollers pulled at my hair just like any other brand. The clips are ok, but I&#x27;d recommend getting a cheaper roller if possible. Nothing special at all about these.</li>
    <li> If you have thick long hair like me DONT get these. They stick to your hair like Velcro. If you don&#x27;t want them to come out well then get these because they don&#x27;t come out! They are well made and if you have thin hair these will probably be perfect for you.</li>
    <li> I like them, the price was good, the only ting is, I wish they had longer clips on them and also more medium or large instead of small.</li>
    <li> These were just what I was hoping for.  The clip helps them stay in my hair and there are plenty of different sized curlers to choose from</li>
    <li> If my 30 day window had not passed, I would return it since the clips are gradually opening up (looks like a pelican with it&#x27;s mouth open!).  I am having to leave the roller in my hair with the clip hanging down because the clip will not hold.  Don&#x27;t really like the clips in the first place as they are difficult to put into the roller at the base, even when one tries it from the opposite side on which the clip is fastened.  I have short hair, so there was not an issue with entanglement, but I also found that they won&#x27;t hold very well without the clip.  Most likely will discard and look for a different style!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 9/22/13 Yup. Had to discard and purchase another brand without clips.  Bought clips to use in the new velcro rollers and they work like a charm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sorry this product failed my expectation.  My hair got caught in the roller and I had an awful time unrolling it.&lt;br /&gt;Also... it did not curl as expected.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need all the sizes in this pack, but the ones that are right for me work very well. At first I thought that having the clips attached to the roller was simply convenient, then I realized it was also keeps the roller in place better if you clip the roller on the opposite side to where the elastic thread is attached.  I ended up buying two packs to get the quantity of the sizes that I wanted. A great investment as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> This product was horrible. You would get the same results from a roll of Velcro!&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of how little hair you roll in them, it gets caught in the roller. Product might work if you remove the velcro like material from the roller. I just recommend not wasting your money on it!</li>
    <li> Needs more small rollers!  The velcro may be a little softer than usual, but I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase again just for this reason.</li>
