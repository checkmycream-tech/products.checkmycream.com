<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In the process of finding ways to remove hair from my skin, I briefly tried epilation. It didn&#x27;t work for me. The machine is way too harsh and hurts the skin when pulling the hair out of it. It&#x27;s also not pleasant as all the moving parts kind of scratch the skin while using it. It&#x27;s kind of like plucking each and every hair slowly from the root. The most painful way of going about removing hair, I think.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Daughter &amp; she loves it</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MACHINE IS ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I HAVE DONE, I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL. AND NEARLY 3 YEARS HAVE PASSED AND IS LIKE NEW. HOLD USE AND ABUSE HAHAHA.</li>
    <li> My personal opinion is that epilators are there to do a job, and this one does it well without the fancy applications (aka cost additions) found on other models.  I wish it came with a little brush to sweep away the little hairs stuck on the epilator after though.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  I don&#x27;t think it hurts.  Drawbacks: My legs aren&#x27;t as smooth as when I shave, and I do have to use a loofah to avoid ingrown hairs, and the hair has to be long enough for the tweezers to grab the hair.  Pros:  Its nice to have the hair gone for days.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting goose bumps and all the hair on my legs popping out like when I shave.  I don&#x27;t have to think, I can&#x27;t put on shorts or a swimsuit because I didn&#x27;t shave today.  I tried it on the bikini line, yes it hurts a little, BUT hair free for over a week so far!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with how fast this works.  I had an epilator back in the late 80&#x27;s that I used twice &amp; finally gave away because of the pain.  This isn&#x27;t anywhere near that kind of pain.  It hurts some but its not bad &amp; if the hair stays gone for awhile then it will definately permantely replace my old electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Never used an epilator before, so I cannot compare this product to others, but I am very pleased with the results I have been getting. Yes, it hurts, and the first time is the worst, but it gets less painful with each use and I love the results, much less stubble and no more daily shavings.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I had really think hair and visible pores on my legs.  I read a review that stated it would thin out the thinkness after several uses so I had to give it a try.  And it did just that! You know the saying for mens beard, \\&quot;Five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot;, well I had that on my legs.  Now I can go without shaving my legs for a week without visible stubble. I usually use this product once a week and then shave afterwards for a smooth finish. Like other reviews mention, this product does not leave your legs silky smooth. But it beats shaving daily!</li>
    <li> I found that shaving the day before I tried epilating really helped.  That way, when I did epilate, it only pulled a few hairs, which wasn&#x27;t painful.  Next day I used the epilator again with the new hair growth.  A little more painful, but still, not all the hairs had grown in so it was tolerable.  I repeated this process for about a week.  I did a follow-up epilation about once a week and after about 2 months, the hairs that grow back are so soft and fine that I don&#x27;t necessarily have to shave right away.  I epilate about every two weeks right now.  Sometimes I do it more often just because it&#x27;s addicting.  I haven&#x27;t tried bikini or underarm areas yet, but those are next on my list.       Oh, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s loud!  Product is great, functionality is great, it&#x27;s just so loud.  Sometimes when I lean over my legs while epilating, it actually hurts my ears!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my epilator for a few weeks now and I like it quite a bit just for the fact that I can do it once and my legs will be virtually hair-free for the next week or so.  This product is great for women like me who HATE to shave their legs and I really didn&#x27;t feel any pain at all from it. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive and after reading some of the reviews on here, I was literally bracing myself when I first tried it, but I hardly felt anything except for a few hard tugs on my skin every once in awhile.  I do feel a little pain around my ankles where the  skin is more sensitive though but I can live with that especially since shaving my legs in the past has caused me a lot more pain and scarring than this thing ever will.  The downsides that I&#x27;ve encountered have been ingrown hairs, which I leave alone to grow out. The ingrown hairs are not as bad as I thought they would be and I don&#x27;t have any redness or swelling, but I do see the hair under the skin and it&#x27;s kind of annoying and unattractive if you&#x27;re looking closely.  The other problem is stubble.  No matter how  many times I go over an area, there always seem to be roughness from the re-growing hair.  I think the best way to get around this is to let my hair grow for awhile so that it&#x27;s all long enough to pull.  That way it will give me more even coverage.  Overall though I think this product is good for women who just don&#x27;t want to deal with shaving their legs and are looking to other alternatives besides laser hair removal and waxing.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  This just wasn&#x27;t as good of an epilator as I was looking for.  It can&#x27;t do bikini or armpit.  You&#x27;re better off getting a different one.</li>
    <li> I do my bikini and my upper lip with this product. Have no ingrown hairs or anything. Takes a bit getting used to but AMAZING, cheap and fast. If you wax, this is nothing. Worth every penny and then some.</li>
    <li> I honestly thought i would have to get something to accompany this to be totally hair free but I am very pleasantly surpised by the results.  I was also pleased that it did not need batteries.  I have been having serious chin hair growth problems since my daughter was born, and even though this product is supposed to be for legs , it worked great on my chin.  It was actually smooth.  ~warning~ if you are not used to plucking this may not be the best product for you,  But it was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the past one month, and it is just amazing. Im used to waxing so this pain is not even close to what i used to experience while i wax. I used it on the underarms for the first time, it was painful, but i feel its worth it as my underarms are so smooth and clean after years of shaving and waxing. I have never felt so smooth in my life till date. This product is indeed addictive but it is worth the money and its a must buy!!! Will highly recommend this product and 5 stars to it :)    Updated after use: Amazing amazing product... i will never ever go back to shaving or waxing again in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Frankly, I regret buying this product. I don&#x27;t know how others (who have given 5 stars) use this but after using this product, it feels more like an electronic razor than an epilator. Here&#x27;s why.  I first used this on my leg.  I believe this epilator pulls out only about 50% of my hair. and the rest? not even touched or just cut so that tiny hairs (ranging from 1mm to 2 mm) are just left on my legs.  Overall, the little gadget looks made quite poorly. it&#x27;s all cheap plastic except the numerous tweezers embedded in the roller.  The manual says that this epilator can pick up hair due to these tiny plastic rollers that are attached at the mouth of the epilator... FAIL it&#x27;s useless.  I only gave it a 1 star because it managed to pull out some hair, but seriously, why bother using this if you have to go over the spots looking for unpulled out hair or do a shave afterward.    Just as another poster said, be prepared to spend at least an hour (literally) if you want a thorough job done.  you have to go over your leg so slowly that the tweezer has time to pull out your hair (if you&#x27;re lucky that is...)    Also another thing... they give you this tiny brush (can&#x27;t even call it a brush cus it&#x27;s so cheap looking - it&#x27;s just strands of coarse/sticky plastic bristles attached to piece of plastic) so you can clean out the epilator after you know... epilating. BUT!!!! it does a very poor job of brushing away your hair because your tiny bits of hair get stuck to the blades and the tweezers and won&#x27;t budge... I ended up using tape but I&#x27;ve only removed about 70% of hair residue after using it for the first time on my legs.      Overall,  if I had just gone and shaved, I would have spend less than 5 minutes on both of my legs and would have had a clean shave. Using this took me literally 30 minutes and I had random strands of hair untouched... Plus cleaning afterward is a pain in the ass.  Just to be specific, I don&#x27;t have super coarse hair, but thick enough that if I didn&#x27;t shave,,,it wouldn&#x27;t go unnoticed.</li>
    <li> I hated razor, tried shaving but it did not work for me. Shaving made the hair grows thicker and faster afterwards, plus the roots are impossible to be getting rid of. After reading the reviews, I ordered it to try, I used it for once and already fall in love with this. I used to use small tweezer to pluck out my leg&#x27;s hair, in order to avoid the razor, it took me a few hours to do that but this super electronic tweezer works wonder! You won&#x27;t see the black roots and I have smooth and silkly legs in 20 mins. It does not hurt at all, if you use it on your legs. But, if you use it at your under arm, it won&#x27;t be a pleasant feeling, of course! I will never use anything else besides this for hair removing anymore! highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now and it works great! It does take time to get used to. The first time took the longest and hurt the most. I used the roller the first time but wanted to speed things up so I took it off. 2 speeds is great if you&#x27;re working with the more sensitive areas you can tone it down. I have used it on my legs, arms, bikini line and underarms. Works wonderful on all. Doing the underarms does hurt. I would recommend a quick wax first just to get most hairs off and then use this, it will help with the pain. (I just used an at home wax kit.) I hate shaving so this product is perfect if you&#x27;re like me.</li>
    <li> All that I can say is OUCH OUCH WTF OUTCH. Are you serious? What women go through is beyond words! I&#x27;m not a hairy person but I wanted to try it out because I too hate having stubbles of hair growing back after 2 days of shaving my arm pits. My 1st and 2nd attempt, I used it on my underarms. It hurt so bad. I did get all the hairs off but it also left me with red blood spots. Not sure how that is more attractive and very sensitive arm pits for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still planning on trying it out for a couple more runs. Like the review said, it will hurt less over time. Hard to believe). Using it on my legs and arms is not a big deal. The skin is tougher there and yet it pinches a little but not a big deal. Do some really use it for their bikini area? Wow. I can&#x27;t even attempt to even think about that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guy roommate tried to use it on his chest and face but after 2 seconds, he screamed like a girl and said no way.</li>
    <li> DONT NOT USE IT ON INNER THIGH!!..I HAVE GOTTEN STRETCH MARKS /SCARS!! (  the area is sensitive there ...it will give you scars) everything else on the body should be fine.</li>
    <li> I used to wax my legs and this product didn&#x27;t cause any extra pain.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, since I use it more often than I did with the wax, it has started to weaken the hair roots and the more I use it the less hair it grows! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all to use it now.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item 14 months ago and still works fine. It is also extremely easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This product is all they say that it is. It is not painful and you are &#x27;hair free&#x27; for weeks. I am so pleased with it I found it to be more than I expected. Nothing else has worked as well. buy it with confidence.</li>
    <li> During the summer I have to shave every day.  I bought this hoping that would solve that problem.  My first use with it was a bit painful.  But, I&#x27;ve been sticking with it and the pain has lessened a lot.  You get used to it with frequent use.  Although, I haven&#x27;t been able to use it at the bikini area yet, but that&#x27;s expected since that area is very sensitive anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair and found that it doesn&#x27;t pull every single hair, but it does do a good job.  I&#x27;m not sorry at all I purchased it.  It&#x27;s really cut down on my shaving, and any woman knows that&#x27;s a blessing!  Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> I have used Satinel from Philips for several years and I must say something , Silk epil from BRAUN hurts less.&lt;BR&gt;Even if it takes me more time to have a perfect skin than with my old Philips, it is more pleasant to use and I was able to use it for my arms too ( i could&#x27;nt do it with my old Epilator)</li>
    <li> I am glad that I opted to replace my epilady with this Braun model. I am fair skinned, my hair is dark grows very quickly so these gadgets are a godsend especially in the summer. Although the Braun is louder than the epilady I had (forgot which model, around the same price) It seems to do a better job at plucking everything off. It is much much sturdier, smaller, and a lot easier to hold/ergonomic. I like the attachment with little spiky rollers although I usually leave it off.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I got one and hated it.  It hurt! I decided to give it a try again. There was NO hair pulling &amp; no breaking out of my skin.  I&#x27;m over 60, so I \\&quot;pulled\\&quot; the skin tight in a few sagging places and shaved with ease.  The legs went so well, I tried under my arms and no problems there either.  I read EVERY instruction, and to really test it I did NOT put any lotion on my skin after use.  No Problems... Honest</li>
    <li> This epilator doesn&#x27;t work.  There were a few hairs pulled out, but despite slow, methodic, and repeated motion of the epilator over my legs, they were still hairier than I expected at the end.  I also dislike that the handle gets hot.  I held it in the middle of the handle so I could better direct the recommended 90* angle and motion, and the side closer to the tweezers got uncomfortably hot.  I also thought there would be a reservoir or something into which any pulled hair would be deposited, but there is no such thing.  I found a few hairs attached to the handle by static electricity, and brushed a very few out of the tweezer assembly; so any other hairs that were pulled must have been deposited on my floor (which is carpeted; I didn&#x27;t look, I just vaccuumed).  This was my first (and last) electric epilator, so perhaps my expectations were unrealistic.  I was looking forward to the end of waxing, but this piece is not as quick or effective.</li>
    <li> I have used an epilator before, and even though it hurt like a son of a -, the results were worth it. So, I bought this one knowing that it was still going to really hurt, and just wanting it to take as many hairs as possible in as few passes as possible. I am very pleased with it. True, it hurts, but you&#x27;re ripping hairs out at the root - duh! This model comes with a funny little head that is supposed to make it hurt less, and it does hurt noticeably less than my last model. The important thing is that it does a really good job of getting a lot of hairs each pass. And you don&#x27;t have to wait forever for your hair to grow long enough for the appliance to be able to grab it. It worked just fine on my legs when I had shaved only two days before.</li>
    <li> My first experiences using this gadget were painful, requiring an iron will to persevere. To do even one leg to my satisfaction took something like an hour, so this isn&#x27;t something that is convenient to do. But the results, I feel, make up for it: I no longer need to shave every day, and my legs stay smooth for days at a time, unlike the results from my old Venus razor (as nice as it was). Moreover, I found that using the Silk-epil on hair just beginning to grow back resulted in dramatically less pain than using on legs that had more hairs long enough to pluck. So my advice is, if you&#x27;ve gone very long since last using Silk-epil, shave a few days before you want to use Silk-epil again so your legs don&#x27;t have so much for it to tug on all at once. Also, I can count on my legs being covered in tiny red bumps for several hours after using Silk-epil, so it&#x27;s best to use the day/night BEFORE you need silky-smooth legs. I frequently experience itchy legs now, and I suspect that they are the symptoms of ingrown hairs (to which I AM susceptible, despite using a loofah/mesh scrubber). At least Silk-epil is less messy and gives more reliable results than Nads&#x27; honey-waxing system. Bottom line: Silk-epil gives me the ability (and flexibility) to enjoy silky-smooth legs without the expense or hassle of professional waxing.  If you&#x27;re willing to push through the initial adjustment period, you&#x27;ll likely find this investment well worth it.</li>
    <li> They said it would have no or little pain. They lied, this product was very painful. I rushed to send it back and get my refund!  I do not recommend this prouduct at all. I didn&#x27;t give it any stars becasuse it didn&#x27;t deserve any but I had to.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00006592X Braun Soft Perfection SE3170 Epilator, Pink]]      This epilator is amazing. It hurts far less than waxing if you do it gently for the first time. Then for a second round to clean perfectly, you can speed up and be harsh on yourself. It doesn&#x27;t hurt even one tenth of what it hurts if you wax. And it cleans as well as waxing. I would say it even takes much lesser time than waxing unless you are too skilled at waxing. I say this because before buying it, I was scared it will hurt a lot and bought it only for rare use, but now I think I will never use wax again.  Ya, hold the skin taut while using it, and I did use it everywhere, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. You can also use it on the back side of the body where you can&#x27;t look and can&#x27;t wax.  And all this comes with no messiness and no fear of burns. I certainly couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it promises &amp; at a price much less than the more expensive epilators, which I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other epilators.  My last one was at least three times the price, cordless, wet/dry... only lasted me a year.  After a few months it slowed down, started getting hot, and then stopped working altogether.  For the price, this epilator is waaayyy  better.  It&#x27;s much much faster, I rather put up with the cord and noise if it gets the work done fast.  It does hurt...  but what can you expect??  --&gt; it is pulling out the hair after all.  The price is unbelieveably awesome!</li>
    <li> After tweezing my underarms since puberty, I decided to finally buy an epilator.  After reading many reviews, I decided on this one and I&#x27;m glad I did!  Although it was my first time epilating and I was terrified of the moving parts and loud noise of the Braun, it actually did not hurt at all but that might be because I&#x27;ve been tweezing for so long and am immune to pain in that area.  This product is really great, it gets the hairs out quickly and easily.  You have to hold the skin taught and like another reviewer here, I had to do some tricky maneuvering.  The reason this rating is only 4 stars instead of 5, is because some hairs are not pulled out at the root and are just pinched off at the surface of the skin.  However, I really recommend buying this product!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this model as a replacement for my trusted 6-years-old Braun Silk Epil SuperSoft plus epilator, which still works fine but cannot handle US power supply outlets (I have just moved here from Europe). This newer version is not up to par with the old one, alas. The noise from the engine makes it utterly unpleasant to use, whereas the old one was tolerable. I also noticed it scratches the skin a little more than the old one did, and I attribute it to the type of plastic used in the casing: the old one had a somewhat soft plastic casing and rollers, this one has very hard plastic parts.  Nevertheless, it does the job I expect it to do: removes most hair long enough to be mechanically removed in minimum time and with acceptable levels of pain (I use it on my legs, underarms and bikini). Wax does as good a job as far as removing, but it is silent and more gentle on the skin. It takes a lot longer and is messy though, so I use both systems: the epilator most of the time or for regular maintenance, and waxing every now and then to start anew.  Since I am lucky enough to still have my old epilator, I will use it with the power cord provided with the new one (it works, I have tried). That&#x27;s a bit pricey for a simple power cord + adapter, hence the 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I shared a Philips ice epilator with my sister before this one (which was really great), but when I moved to U.S. I bought [[ASIN:B00006592X Braun SE3170 Silk-épil SoftPerfection Epilator]]. Initially I was looking for one with ice, but could not find any appropriate offered at the time. This, however, works well for me and I guess price-wise is also a good deal. It is small, light (in case you want to take it for travel), easy to use and works for both 110 and 220 V (might be important to Europeans like me).</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about epilators and was very excited to try this product! Unfortunately, this turned out to be a waste of time, pain, and money. I gave it several tries, first showering and exfoliating, then trying it without showering, etc. Each time I&#x27;d go slow and follow the directions, but the epilator failed to get most of the hairs and I was still left with red bumps everywhere and legs that were far from smooth.</li>
    <li> I HATE to shave.  I have attempted to wax in the past, which provides great results, but is messy and time consuming.  This is the first epilator I have used and I am overall very pleased with it.  It only takes about 20 minutes to do both legs and then they stay stubble free for a couple of weeks.  when the hair grows back it is very fine and not stubbly at all.  As for the pain, I have waxed for the last few years, so the pain of epilating was minimal.  Over time, as with anything, the pain decreases.  It doesn&#x27;t even phase me now.  The product is not the best at getting very fine hairs, but I don&#x27;t mind that.  I think some of my hairs are naturally very fine and I can just shave those after epilating.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This product I bought was same as described. The hair removal was very good and woekrd perfectly.</li>
    <li> The epilator works great.  Please know that the first few times you use it, there will be some pain.  You are pulling the hairs right out of your legs, so please know what to expect.  Once you get used to the pain or it diminishes, you will have smooth skin for days longer than shaving.  I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used. It comes with a 60 day warranty. Mine fell apart on the 60th day, the 4th time I used it (one of the massaging rollers fell off, the screw just came out.) This was on a Sunday, so I could not mail it in til the 61st day. I&#x27;ve been trying to get ahold of an actual person for Braun to ask if I can still mail in my epilator to be repaired (as this is the 61st day), but it appears getting an actual person instead of an automated message is impossible. The motor still works, but it is annoying that the roller came off.  Overall, I would say the epilator is painless. Now, it hurt like crazy the first time I used it - I think I could now handle getting tasered - but after the first time, the pain was far less. It doesn&#x27;t even hurt to use it on the bikini line. (Again though, the first time is AWFUL and I did bleed.)   However, I am unimpressed by the hair removal. It takes a very long time, and despite going over the same spot over and over, there are still a lot of hairs left behind, so I always have to shave afterward anyway. I also get red dots from the epilator that have lasted for almost 24 hours.  I don&#x27;t think the epilator was worth the money, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do its job.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and course hair so this little number makes a big different. I never have epilated before so it does hurt the first few times but after a while you get used to it. This one works really good. It does not get all the hair so you may have to re do your legs the next day. The only reason I did not give it a 5 because it does not make you feel smooth like shaving. So I wait about 3 days and use a regular razor for the little hairs it cannot get for a smooth feeling. Plus adding moisture everyday helps. (Just don&#x27;t moisture on the day you epilate or the day after)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it on bikini or underarms yet.</li>
    <li> excellent product once your pain tolerance goes up and you get the hang of using it. nice smooth underarms for a long time but I have a problem with my legs since my hair is so fine it doesn&#x27;t grab all of the hairs as fast as it does in other areas. still a little too scared to use it on much of my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s willing to put up with some pain for a couple months (couple weeks between uses) while they get used to using an epilator</li>
    <li> This is an excellent quality device, it keeps your legs smooth and hairless, is easy to use and is much cheaper than the amount of money that you will need to spend if you use razors. I have used these for many years, I am used to the feeling and this does not cause any pain. There are 2 plastic \\&quot;protectors\\&quot; that come with the device, they prevent the device from getting too close to your skin. I tried to epilate with the protector in place, but it did not work that well. When I epilated without any protector at all, the epilation was far more successful. It is nice not having to deal with razor blade cuts on my legs. This epilator also epilates the rough skin from your legs and the result is smooth and hairless legs. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I think this product works well, but after using it a few times I began to get painful ingrown hairs on my legs.</li>
    <li> After using the battery-operated EpiLady Traveler for a couple of months, I got fed up with the batteries running down after only a few minutes of use and the slow rate of leg-hair removal.  Ordered the Braun Soft Perfection with AC adapter, and am AMAZED at what a fantastic job it does, with virtually no discomfort.  It seems to remove more hair faster, without the annoyance of having to replace batteries after virtually every use.</li>
    <li> I actually did tons of reviewing and research on different types of epilators before i bought this particular one. That being said i am highly dissapointed with the performance that I&#x27;ve received. Yes the Braun picked up the more visible hairs but my legs never seemed to be \\&quot;soft\\&quot; - I could always feel those little stubbles all over my legs even if i spent 30 minutes going over with the Braun on each of them. Also the Massaging rollers and EfficiencyPro cap didn&#x27;t work at all. Massaging rollers actually were a little ticklish for me and the efficiencypro cap left little lines of scratches all over my legs. All in all the only good thing about this epilator was that i&#x27;ve never gotten any cuts, nicks, or burns. I&#x27;ve gotten alot of ingrown hairs instead.</li>
    <li> Pros:   Fast results, did both legs (ankle to top of thigh) in 30 minutes.  Long lasting, results lasted three weeks before I had to use it again.  Leaves legs feeling smooth, no stubble.  Did underarms in five minutes.   Lasted three weeks before I had to use it again.  Left underarms silky smooth, no stubble.  Different speed settings.  Easy to use.  Cons:  Very loud!  Using accessories does not give same results as using nothing.  Tips: If you have ingrown hairs before you use this, exfoliate first. If not, exfoliate after to prevent ingrown hairs.  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!  You are pulling your hair out by the root! It is going to hurt unless you are use to the feeling from previous epilating or waxing.  Your hair grows in cycles, so you may (like me) have to use it for a week to get all the new-grown hair before you see longer lasting results.  Use a towel under as there is no way for the device to catch/store the hair.</li>
    <li> Update - Here is what I think is the best way to use this type of epilator.  After you&#x27;ve used it for a while your hair grows in softer and softer.  Eventually the hairs are so soft they get broken off instead of pulled out.  If you return to shaving for a few weeks the hairs will grow in stiffer and stiffer.  At that point you can go back to using the epilator because it will grab and pluck out the new stiff growth.  The only downside is that you will experience something close to the original first time use pain when you start up with the epilator again.  But after two or three sessions the pain is not longer an issue.    Original review:  I&#x27;ve owned two Emjoi epilators, one was corded and one was cordless.  Neither lasted more than a couple of years so when my last one quit I thought I&#x27;d try a different brand.  For me this Braun works much better on my legs than the Emjoi models.  I have fine hair and the Emjoi missed most of it so I had to go back over and over an area many times to get all the hairs out.  This Braun gets more hair with each pass and I think it has to do with the guard - it has tiny teeth that must lift the hairs up so the tweezers can grab them.  It comes with two guards - one, for sensitive skin or beginners, has a row of tiny wheels along each edge that supposedly massage the skin making the process more comfortable.  I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removal for years so did not bother trying the wheelie guard on my legs but I did try it for my underarms to see if it might hurt less.  Well just as with the Emjoi I am disappointed with the results I get on my underarm area.  The wheelie guard was of no use at all, it seems to me that it prevents the tweezers from reaching most of the hairs.  With the regular guard it works about the same as the Emjoi but the guard falls off during the process so that&#x27;s a big nuisance.  The looser skin and the concave shape of an armpit makes this type of hair removal very tedious.  I need to find a model just for underarms, something much smaller that would reach up in there better.  Anyway, that&#x27;s the only reason I withhold one star from this Braun epilator - that it didn&#x27;t work great on my underarms.  Otherwise it is much better than the Emjoi for my legs and unless it breaks soon I&#x27;ll stay with this brand from now on.  Noise factor is about the same for both brands.  I always wear soft foam ear plugs when I use anything with a noisy motor.    UPDATE - the guard, the one with the ridges, will not stay in place so I&#x27;ve begun to leave it off.  I can do my legs just fine without a guard but found out the hard way that I can not do my underarms without a guard.  Yeee-ouch!  So for underarms I put the guard on and have to try to hold it with one finger to keep it from coming off.  This makes doing underarms ever more difficult but with patience I do get the job done.    Another update - I have noticed that hair on my legs grows back much faster with this epilator than it did with the Emjoi and I think it&#x27;s because this epilator mostly breaks the hairs off rather than pull them out.  So instead of the hair having to totally grow back in it only has to return to its previous length.</li>
    <li> I received item on time and in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve had my exfoliator for over a month and still works great! I can go a week without exfoliating because it pulls hair to its root. Hair grows back slowly and thinner!! This exfoliator saves time and worry about ingrown hair. WAY better than plucking each hair or shaving every couple days.</li>
    <li> Overall, this epilator works really well. I used to wax my legs, but didnt like letting the hair grow long in between. The epilator is able to work on pretty short hairs- as short as 3-4mm. The pain gets less as the hair gets finer with more use. The only downside is that my legs are not completey smooth like just after waxing and sometimes it breaks off hairs mid shaft rather than getting all of them from the root. You may have to go over an area a few times to get everything...but it does beat having course shaving stubble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for 22 years. I use it even for underarm and bikiniline. I never liked shaving or even waxing.     Epilator is quite convenient, clean (unlike wax that is sticky, messy, and requires hair to be long enough...), and portable. You can take it with you anywhere. I&#x27;m used to it, therefore I don&#x27;t feel any pain, but even if you are new to it, you get used to the little pain.</li>
    <li> Braun Products, good as always.  I had one before this (same brand) that I bought 10 years ago and still works (my sister uses it).  Products for life.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator that I&#x27;ve tried, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Yes, it was painful (and I do have a tattoo-it was kind of similar in a way). I had to take a break when I switched legs! I figured I would get used to it, and even though my legs still felt stubbly I know that hair grows at different rates and figured I would get it next time and that it would be worth it if I had to shave less. My legs were red and kind of angry afterwards, but it went away. I used the epilator again a week later, and same thing-super painful, still felt the stubble. Skip ahead a week, and my entire leg is filled with itchy, painful, ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve been in an exfoliate/bactine/lotion routine for a few days, and it&#x27;s getting better, but my leg looks like it got attacked with needles! The hairs are finally growing out, but it&#x27;s still painful.     Take home message: it&#x27;s not worth it! I NEVER got smooth legs with this product, and I&#x27;m dealing with the painful aftermath weeks after sending it back! I will be so happy when all of my little ingrown hairs grow out that I&#x27;m thinking of embracing the hippie look for a while. ugh.</li>
    <li> This product does all it promises!  At 62 I have more peach fuzz on my face than desired!  Not enough hormones they say.  This shaver gets rid of that fuzz faster and stays gone longer than waxing!  It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable the first time; but no more fuzz!  Remember kissing grandma on the cheek and feeling fur?  I don&#x27;t want to be that grandma!!!  I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Wife said it works great.  She said she likes it a lot and pulls out a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice.... Very fast.... Very serious</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and loved it.  Works great with no pain.  Shipping was so fast and the product quality is excellent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not hard to shave my legs everyday, so why did I think I needed this? I still shave my legs about once every three days. Honestly, I would rather just shave everyday. It would be easier, but I paid a pretty penny for this thing, so I&#x27;m going to use it!    Yes, it will pull the hair out of your legs, but it is a very tedious process that involves going back over the same spot many times, even after exfoliating.     As far as the ouch factor....    legs - not bad  bikini/underarms - bad  anywhere else - moderatly bad to bad.    It&#x27;s not so much that it doesn&#x27;t work, but the money, effort and pain are just not worth it. By the time I get to my second leg, I&#x27;m ready to give up!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ve been epilating a few years now and this epilator fits its description well.</li>
    <li> Ok, granted this is the only epilator I&#x27;ve ever tried - I still maintain it&#x27;s better than shaving, waxing or plucking. It goes incredibly FAST! The pain is not much worse than with waxing, and it really only hurts the first time. If you use this gadget whenever hairs start growing in (to maintain), the subsequent uses don&#x27;t hurt at all. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between the two attachments - one with massaging rollers and the other without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint I saw when reading reviews before I bought this was ingrown hairs, but that problem is not unique to this epilator or even epilators in general. This device was fantastic at pulling hairs out by the root. I could tell when I was cleaning it out. As others have recommended, ingrown hairs can be avoided if you exfoliate and moisturize after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used the Original coil-type Epilady for almost 20 years, when my second one finally burned up I decided to try the Braun SE3170 Silk-epil.  I love this epilator! While the hair on my legs is virtually non-existent anymore I thought I would try my armpits. The first time was a killer - and hurt for almost 24 hours, but after that I have had no problems! In fact the hair barely grows back and is already quite fine. You can see a substantial root being pulled out which makes me feel very satisfied. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I Love it, even tough is a little painful in the beginning its better than bikini wax!  Is fast is convenient i love it !!!!!Save money and time!And just not shaving every other day is great!It last 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I can&#x27;t say that it is pain free but if you were used to waxing you can easily handle the pain. It is very practical and easy to use. I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The good news is this gadget really isn&#x27;t that painful (however I would put up with a moderate amount of pain if I didn&#x27;t have to shave anymore).  The bad news is it misses about 1/2 of the hair on my leg.  I followed the instructions and used the attachements and no attachements but it would not pick up all the hair (I have very fine leg hair).  The hair it did get it was very effective in not growing back for 6 weeks.  I will continue to play around with it but I am still back to razors.</li>
    <li> I was going back and forth with myself on this one, not knowing whether an epilator would be worth the money. I knew that Braun was a good brand, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on the Xpressive model, so I chose this one since the reviews were so good. And I must say I&#x27;m very pleased. It arrived exactly on time a few days ago, and since my leg hairs weren&#x27;t long enough to pluck, (and because I&#x27;m apparently insane) I went straight for my underarms with this baby. On a pain scale of 1 to 10 I&#x27;d say the underarms rated as a 1.5 for me. Yes, I have an almost superhuman tolerance for pain, but this really wasn&#x27;t that bad. The legs are almost a zero for pain.    The only issue I had was epilating the backs of my upper legs, because the hairs are so fine that they would sometimes break instead of coming out in one piece. It took a few swipes to gets all the hairs, but if I had waited for them to grow a little longer, I know I wouldn&#x27;t have had even that little bit of trouble. Yes, the longer hairs do hurt a little more. I take a warm shower and exfoliate to soften the hair and skin before I epilate, and it really helps.    I would describe the pain as more of a prickly sensation. It is a little startling the first time you use it, but after a few minutes I even forget it was pulling hairs out. I found that using the epilator without either of the attachments was just slightly more painful, but I ended up getting far more hairs with each pass. My legs are usually quite sensitive, but I find that I don&#x27;t get the usual rash with this epilator like I do with convential shaving.    Overall, this was well worth the money, considering I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday. No more wasted money with razors and creams that just end up irritating my skin. I actually find myself now searching for more places to use this thing! :D</li>
    <li> I had never tried an epilator, I decided to buy one because my cousins were telling me how they used one for their legs and their legs were hairless for weeks! After they telling me that I should expect to spend around $50 or $60 on one I saw this one for $32 and decided to buy it and I have to say I loved it, it did a great job, I used it over two weeks ago and I still dare to use shorts because the hairs that have grown are very light and not noticeable. But it did hurt the first time, and I am used to waxing everywere. Still will keep using it, I am now in the search for one for facial hairs.</li>
    <li> the product is great. even though it was lost by post when it was sent the first time. but then we got the replacement and are very satisfied by the product. Good job, Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars, but there is a catch to this: I&#x27;m fairly sure that it is the most painful product available on Amazon. I bought it not having ever used an epilator before, and having no other product to compare it to, this is it. It does exactly what it says -- it rips the hair out by the root. This sounds tame when you&#x27;re thinking of tweezing, or even waxing - this is more painful than both, especially on the body. It is, in my opinion, more painful to use on my forearms than the tattoos were that I have on my forearms. However, it gives you very smooth skin, and hairlessness. I have to warn those people who are sensitive to pain that it will not be a \\&quot;fun\\&quot; experience (I nearly passed out the first time!), but in terms of looking and feeling good, it is worth the trouble. If you&#x27;re like me, and are tired of the unwanted hair (and razor stubble), it is the product for you. Additionally, though I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, I&#x27;m pretty sure that the first time  will be the worst pain-wise...like waxing, it should get easier with time, as the hair grows back much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add also that I have pretty dark, coarser hair, and this worked amazingly. It didn&#x27;t break off as some reviewers have complained - I&#x27;m not sure if the texture of the hair has anything to do with it, but I didn&#x27;t experience that issue at all.</li>
    <li> I do not like stubble on my legs at all.  I shave daily.  Unfortuntely, this product only works with longer hair on the legs.  It did not work at all for stubbble.  I was sadly disappointed, but this product will not work for me.</li>
    <li> I used to own a EpiLady and loved using it even though it hurt.  You could really feel it grabbing and ripping each hair out of your skin.  I just received the Braun Soft Perfection epilator product in the mail today and was anxious to use it.  I barely felt a thing!  I wondered if it was even working, but I was left with soft, smooth legs.  I like that it came with an extra long power cord so I don&#x27;t have to contort my body to get it where I need it.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  Braun Soft Perfection Silk Epil works really well for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model based on the reviews. It simply doesn&#x27;t get the hairs. I went up and down and sideways over and over again but this shaver was still not getting all the hairs. It&#x27;s very frustrating. I could have dealt with the pain had this shaver actually worked.</li>
    <li> The product is good. So far i have had no problems with it. Its really makes the skin soft after use and the effect lasts for two to three weeks.</li>
    <li> review: I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years and it hasn&#x27;t died yet.  I use this on my legs as a replacement for shaving.  I still have to use this once a week and it takes a little longer than regular shaving but I find it well worth it. I will never go back to shaving.  After prolonged use of the epilator,  grows back very thin, legs never feel pokey and after a freezing day your legs don&#x27;t get pokey.  It takes a few months to get used to the pulling but after 2 years, I look forward to it, it&#x27;s therapeutic in a weird way.  I can&#x27;t use this anywhere else as it&#x27;s too painful for other areas.  It has 2 tops, one for less feel and the other you can feel more.  I have recommended to others and thinking about gifts for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: legs are never again pokey, hair grows back thinner</li>
    <li> I ordered this after my last one (a battery-charged one) finally crapped out on me. I LOVE THIS ONE in the fact that, because it&#x27;s electric, I don&#x27;t run out of power in the middle of doing my legs and that it does a great job! I&#x27;ve only had to use it once in the past month because it did such a great job! And my boyfriend loves it because I have smooth legs in the morning AND at night! I would recommend this for anyone who has used an epilator because they&#x27;re sick of shaving their legs every day! And it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
    <li> Overall the epilator removed all hairs from the legs and arms. However, when at an angle, sometimes it cannot pull out the hair or you need to run over the angled area many times (ESP the leg). Thin hairs are still present after using the epilator so it does a better job on thicker hair. As for the pain, it&#x27;s not too bad. The first few times will leave your skin feeling tingly, but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> I was really happy to find it online because I was unable to buy it from any store...and it was exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product has received so many good reviews because I bought this and it really sucks.  CONS  It is unbearably painful.  For all the pain you&#x27;ll receive, 4 weeks of \\&quot;no hair\\&quot; is not worth all the pain.  This product skips lots of hairs, which is why I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using braun epilators for 14 years now and this is VERY DISAPPOINTING! I didn&#x27;t believe that this brand can make a bad epilator but here it is ... it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my previous ones.</li>
    <li> I used this epilator exactly 2 times before the head came apart and will not go back together.    The construction is poor.  The plastic piece on top does not fit correctly.    Do not waste your money on this low-end epilator.</li>
    <li> In selecting which epilator would be the best for me I read several reviews. I finally decided on this one because of price, it plugged in, brand recognition, and others&#x27; reviews.    I had shaved my calves a few days before the item arrived. I have used it several times since then on my entire leg and underarms [which also had been shaved a few days before.]  I would recommend this method. It does hurt only a tiny bit because initially you are picking up short or stray hairs.     Another recommendation is that you read the instructions. You are to use the product on dry legs [no lotion], hold the device upright [90 degree angle], and move it in the direction of the on/off switch. I am wondering if reviewers having trouble were moving the device in the wrong direction.    I love being hairless! It is great not to feel stubble in 12 hours. And I love that I don&#x27;t have bloody knees from nicking myself when I was shaving!</li>
    <li> I have only shaved my legs and armpits once in my life and that was when I decided I was not going to do that every day. I have been waxing them for 10 years now, but now I moved and I can&#x27;t get to a salon. That&#x27;s why I researched epilators and chose Braun, which seems like the most reliable epilator manufacturer. I chose the cheapest model because I only intend to do this for the 4 months that I don&#x27;t have access to waxing. I was really scared of pain, but I still tried it out right after it came in the mail. It was almost painless! Now, I have been waxing for 10 years and my hair is really soft and thin, but waxing still hurts. This didn&#x27;t! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I thought it somehow wasn&#x27;t working, but it was. I also did my armpits, which hurt a little, but it was worth it. I&#x27;m going to do my bikini soon too and I&#x27;m not afraid anymore. I can&#x27;t believe that people don&#x27;t do this because it hurts too much. This just confirms that your hair does not grow the same when you shave it and when you wax it.  I only removed hair from the knees down and spent about 30 minutes doing that. Cleaning the epilator is quite simple. I believe this is the perfect epilator for beginners and I only wish I would have bought the more expensive version, because it has more tweezers and probably gets the job done faster.</li>
    <li> Best thing I did for my legs! :) you get use to that kind of pain quickly, but in my opinion the best time to start using epilator is after waxing (when new hair starts to grow)..sometimes you have to be patient when epilating, maybe going over some places twice or even three times but it pays off</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my girlsfriend after watching her waste endless hours plucking out hair from various nether regions of her body. Her friend had recommended it, so I tuned in on her recommendation. Pacakge came fast as it was Amazon direct merchant shipping. She tried it &amp; loved it. Never again with the old tweezer after trying this body &#x27;lawn-mower&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This epilator is much superior to the Norelco. It works very fast and is able to epilate smaller hair from legs and underarms. Regular use makes your hair smaller and lighter. Since its faster and more efficient it is less painful. I own a couple of epilators and would recommend this over Emjoi and Norelco. Would use with caution over bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An update: I have used this epilator now for 5 years. It has been The Best Epilator I have used so far!! I use it every other day, hair is finer and almost non-exsistant. I also use it on the face, better than any other used in the past. If you can withstand the pain, its totally worth it!!</li>
    <li> Up until 02/2011 I&#x27;d always stuck to using a razor to deal with body hair. Then I got the idea in my head that I could tweeze out all the hairs--which I did, and I was pleased with how long it took the hair to grow back when compared to shaving, though this was pretty tedious. Then I got the idea that an epilator does almost the same thing as my hand paired with with tweezers and after reading reviews on several epilators available I settled on getting this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit makes a buzzing noise while operating from the epilation head moving but no one in my household has noticed or brought it up. It&#x27;s probably as loud as a handheld electronic mixer. I wouldn&#x27;t use it around someone trying to sleep, but it&#x27;s not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially the results weren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting. I thought my legs still felt a little rough but once I tried epilating after applying a little aloe gel and vegetable glycerine I was pretty pleased with the results. I don&#x27;t bother with the aloe and VG most of the time since compared to immediate stubble from shaving, I&#x27;d rather slightly rough legs. I find that the hair here pops up pretty quick but thankfully this issue is relegated to my legs only. Used for the bikini area (yes, that&#x27;s a sensitive area and it will not tickle to do) or underarm I&#x27;m left smooth for 2 weeks or so and after a few weeks of regular use the pain was less--if not nonexistent and I could tell it was actually removing the entire hair down to the root on those areas so the hairs started to take a while to grow back. It took me some time to figure out how to get that attachment with the rows of spiked pink gel things off and I much prefer to use it without any of the attachments included. Although I feel like I&#x27;m constantly finding hair on my legs with the Silk-epil, everywhere else stays bare for well over a week unlike shaving where I tend to find stubble the very next day regardless of the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on ingrown hairs: I have very curly hair and am no stranger to this phenomenon. If I do not exfoliate as often as possible after using most forms of hair removal, I fully expect to pay the price for it eventually by finding my hairs growing back in all curled up underneath my skin. This is not the fault of the epilation system but how the hair grows. If you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hairs (and even if you&#x27;re not) it&#x27;s a good idea to exfoliate at least with something as simple as a store-bought scrub. For something a little more abrasive make a scrub with baking soda (or add it to your store-bought scrub)--or skip all of that and scrub down carefully with a pumice bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product and I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a try.anger to this phenomenon.

    <li> I DID NOT THINK THIS THING WAS GOING TO WORK BUT it does i just got it to day the pain is not that bad i dont think so i love this u have to get one!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I currently use a Braun 5270 (which isn&#x27;t even available anymore) and love it.  The problem is that, after 3 years, the tweezy things don&#x27;t work as well as they used to so it&#x27;s time to upgrade.    I&#x27;m not brave enough to even think about using it on my underarms or bikini area, but it works great on the legs.  No, I don&#x27;t have silky smooth legs for weeks and weeks, but I find that if I use it every 3-4 days I can keep my legs smooth enough.  Yes, I get ingrown hairs, but they&#x27;re right on the surface so I just keep a needle nearby and free the hairs as I find them (no biggie).    Here&#x27;s something I never anticipated when I first started using my Braun though...  Before I got my Braun, I had to have emergency hernia surgery.  I had shaved that morning and had surgery that night.  It was 4 days before I was allowed to move enough to shower and attempt to shave my legs again.  The itchy-pokey stubble was driving me crazy!  A year later - and after I had been using my Braun for about 6 months - I had another hernia surgery.  Again, it was 4 days before I could shower and shave, but I noticed that-because the hair on my legs had grown back softer and not as thick-there was no stubble to make me crazy and I actually decided not to worry about removing the hair until I was moving around better.  After 2 weeks, I finally shaved my legs (because there was so much growth by then) and started using my Braun again.  When I had yet another hernia surgery a year later I was in the hospital for 8 days, but itchy-pokey stubble wasn&#x27;t something I had to worry about :)</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product.  My sister had an electric epilator that I tried, and it stung!  The Soft Perfection has these massage rollers that seem to mask a lot of the sting when the hair is pulled out.  I have noticed already that the hair isn&#x27;t growing back nearly as fast as with a traditional razor, and that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Soft Perfection SE3170 for about a month now and while it is not perfect I do think it is a good product.  The first time I used it it hurt like crazy but after that not so much.  I have not been thrilled with how it works on my legs, it seems like I always have the feeling of stubble.  However, it works great on my underarms.  I have very dark hair and nearly transparent skin so shaving really never looked good.  If I only use it for my underarms I think the Braun Soft Perfection SE3170 is worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an older but similar Braun epilator, which had worked well for 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;  For all you newbies to hairpulling, have faith, after the first dozen times you do it, the agony does dissipate. I started with the hot wax routine. Wow, what a stinky mess; a yucky old pot full of wax and hair, plus all that time spent heating, spreading, ripping... and always the constant risk of burning the skin. Well, these epilator devices are so much better than waxing! Or shaving, for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;  The model 3170 is effective, fast, and able to grasp even short hairs remarkably well. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is very loud. So if you are working near the ears, use those drug store foam earplugs.&lt;br /&gt;  I notice that the transformer thing (that plugs into the electric socket) is smaller and lighter than the old one, which is nice. The device is made in Germany and the overall quality seems to be just as good as my old one, so I anticipate another 10 years of use. I&#x27;ve had it now for a couple months, and highly recommend the device.</li>
    <li> GOOD: I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and certain body parts are smooth-errrr :)  BAD: Very painful on legs, underarms and other body parts the first time. I don&#x27;t think it hurts any less after the first time I just got used to the pain, because I knew what to expect.  UGLY: If you&#x27;re not present and aren&#x27;t paying attention you may cut your skin (just small scabs)</li>
    <li> I got this Braun Epliator 3 months ago it&#x27;s overall good, i like the massaging part in it i can feel less pain with it&#x27;s on it  the only thing i didn&#x27;t like: i felt it&#x27;s noise is a bit higher than my old one</li>
    <li> This product breaks off hairs, which may make the hair be gone for a day or two, but then stubble will return,and when you try to remove the stubble, turns out it&#x27;s not long enough for removal.  For the price you&#x27;re paying, proceed at your own risk and most likely dissapointment.</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun Epilator for years, my old one got dropped and broke.  No fault of the product.  The new one works great and I was pleased with the service.</li>
    <li> Great product. Still working after over 3 years.</li>
    <li> I bought it  like a gift to my wife, where I was thinking that maybe she would not like. But it was the opposite, really she loved it because  extracted  the hair whit the root. It is uncomfortable at the beginning but now she is looking for any hair alone to use the machine. The problem now is for me  because  my sisters and sisters-law want that I will  give it to them.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review at least 6 years after I got this because I was scrolling through the list of products I have purchased throughout the years. I just wanted to say that it still works amazingly well and I have never had any issues. Really great quality!</li>
    <li> I bought this product over 4 years ago and it still works. You should note that it does take time to get used to if you have never used an epilator before. Do not try to use it on long hairs as it will hurt A LOT. I have not been brave enough to try this product under my arms or bikini area. It has worked wonders on my stomach and lower back and the hair has grown back thinner and less often. I recently started using it on my legs, where the hair is thicker and darker than on my stomach and this had to be done as a slow process. I would recommend shaving the area first, and use the epilator when the hair is short and do so in sections. I haave loved the results! I have used the epilator in sparse area every couple of days and my the hair on my legs is growing back thinner. I&#x27;d definitely buy again! As I mentioned, I have had the same epilator for over 4 years and it still works fine, so its worth the price.</li>
    <li> This item works very well on my hair. I feel very nice and smooth after.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It really does what it says it will do. It&#x27;s very easy to maintain and I would recommend using the faster speed.</li>
    <li> this is ok but i think if this could only work as well as waxing, I would give it a 5 star</li>
    <li> It works great. Picks even very short hair and the best of all, it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Do not ever buy any of the Epilady epilators, they just don&#x27;t do the job and are painful!</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator, so you can guess..I had a bad start. I had been wanting to buy a good hair removing system for sometime, and after much searching and reviewing, I landed on this product. The very first try turned out to be quiet a challenge. I found it  much more painful than waxing. It takes a long time to get used to the pinching sensation. The pain recedes, but it remains till the next day. But the result was amazing. The skin was smoother than I have had after shaving/hair removing creme, etc. The second time over, I felt less pain, except in areas where I hadn&#x27;t gone over the first time. One has to go through parts of skin many times over, but in the end it was worth it! I also found that taking a shower before epilating helps. It does give rise to ingrown hair as others have mentioned it. &lt;BR&gt;If you are first time epilator user like me, all you need persistence and patience.&lt;BR&gt;Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I have about 10 years shaving, epilating, waxing, using creams... EVERYTHING. And without doubt I can say this is the greatest system ever. Epilady is 10 times more painful than Silk epil. And it is so fast! This is a great product, it is way more effective than wax (especially when you have to do it twice because you didnt remove all the hair) or than shaving (that sand feeling and itchy sensation just the day after), or using creams (just as shaving but it stinks).  &lt;br /&gt;No regrets, it is the best I have tried! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I started epilating instead of shaving about three years ago. This one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. It is fast yet gentle. That&#x27;s the main thing. The other Braun (blue) is nice because of the light, but it doesn&#x27;t grab as well as this pink one so is somewhat slow.</li>
    <li> was worried about excessive pain and ingrown hairs that come with using an epilator but so far neither of the two have happened. succeeded in epilating underarms a few times but find that to be too painful (hurts way more than waxing). read tips to take a hot shower before using epilator so that pores can open up, making the process less painful and reducing risk of ingrowns. this is what i try to do and so far, so good. in other words, it hasn&#x27;t given me MORE ingrowns than waxing (when used on my legs).  i&#x27;m not a long time epilator and this is my first one. i&#x27;m rather happy with it and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay the steep prices for getting your legs waxed OR doesn&#x27;t want to wait till your hair grows out long enough (i think you can get away with removing shorter hair with the epilator). depending on where you live and whether or not you pay for waxing, this product can pay for itself in one use.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t really pluck out my hair...it cut off the hairs and that way i just didn&#x27;t have the smooth feeling. It also takes a long time to get all of the hair removed--I was prepared for that but it just takes tooo long. I am just disappointed with this product-will probably returning it.</li>
    <li> I do like this product. Yes it hurts the first time you are pulling your hair out. lol  Pain is not bad. I have very fine hair though so sometimes instead of ripping the hair out it just breaks it off.  Takes a long time as would any other Epilator. I had to go over and over to get all the hair. Did the armpits too. It worked well for that also.   I gave it three stars for the breakage of my hair instead of pulling it out. I only get maybe 4 days (same as regular shaving) before I have to do it again. Also it does cost more than others.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to be able to quit shaving my legs (I&#x27;m so tired of that!), but it hasn&#x27;t been satisfactory for that use.  Maybe because I have blondish, fine hair on my legs, I don&#x27;t know.  It is VERY sloooow...that is, to get EVERY hair, you have to move it at snail speed across the skin, and it still doesn&#x27;t leave my legs as silky smooth as shaving.  I did find that the hair grew back thinner (than after shaving), but that&#x27;s because hair grows in cycles and you always have follicles that are in a different stages of growth--the good news then is that if you use this little machine regularly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt very much each time (it hurts a lot the first time or if you let a lot of hair grow back in between, but when you&#x27;re using it regularly, it just feels prickly)  The bad news is that the amount of time it takes to keep legs hair-free with this machine is so much greater than shaving that I eventually gave up and went back to shaving.  HOWEVER: It is awesome for underarms and bikini area.  I guess because the individual hairs are thicker and there aren&#x27;t so many of them, I only have to do a touch up in those areas every 4-7 days to keep them hair-free.  For just those two areas, I think it was totally worth the purchase price, and I&#x27;m glad I own it.  I know that plucking, which is what this item does, will eventually damage the follicle enough that the hair won&#x27;t grow back.  This may take some time (forever it seems at times), but my hope is that eventually I won&#x27;t even need to deal with hair in those areas.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Has to be held at a perfect angle before it works underarm.  Since your arm curves, this is virtually impossible making epilating take a much longer time.  I had a Remington that did not do this. The Remington was ancient and finally burned out.  Also, the head is not big enough, making this take even longer.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I read other people&#x27;s reviews and decided to give this little thing a try.  OUCH!  This thing hurts like hell and doesn&#x27;t even really do a great job.  I tried it with my leg hair longer at first and I couldn&#x27;t even stand it.  I then read another person&#x27;s review to start off with your hair pretty short (a few days after shaving), so I did.  It wasn&#x27;t as painful, but it still was horrible for me.  I would have to go over and over the same spot forever to get hair out and yet, stubble and hairs were still left behind.  No way am I going to be doing this all the time.  It may be great for some people, but it just wasn&#x27;t my choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other epilators in the past but had to go over the same area several times to do the job. This model works great &amp; quickly grabbing even the tiniest hairs. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy one. :o)</li>
    <li> I do not have coarse hair, yet it takes MANY (i.e. too many) passes to remove the hair on my lower legs.  Additionally, the tip scratches the skin easily.  Finally, for the noise it makes, this gadget should be 10 times more powerful.  I bought this model because it was not very expensive, but mostly because the Epilady brand had not resurfaced yet.</li>
    <li> Many reviewers are talking about how painful or not painful this epilator is, but the device has nothing to do with how painful it will be for you. This epilator works by rapidly tweezing hairs as you move it along your skin. The pain you experience is determined by how well you tolerate lots of hairs being pulled in rapid succession, which is mostly affected by how often and how recently you have waxed or epilated.  I have rated this epilator 1 star for the simple fact that it does not work. It does not easily grab hairs, which is why it takes so long. You have to let it rest on a single spot for several seconds before it will grab all of the hairs, if it can even manage it! And it never grabs short stubble, even stubble that I have no problem grabbing by hand with a pair of tweezers. I also find that quite often when it does grab a hair, it will break it rather than pull successfully, leaving me with even more stubble. I have only used this epilator a handful of times on my legs, and each time it took well over an hour even when my legs had been waxed a mere week prior! A waste of time only to end up with broken hairs and stubble. I have been absolutely unsatisfied every time I have used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week for two years now.  Works great.  Sure beats shaving your legs every day and feeling the stubble if you skip a day.  I wish I got it sooner.  The longer you use it, the less painful it feels.</li>
    <li> So before I bought this, I read most of the reviews. the good and bad. I also did my research on youtube! This product in particular, is as noisy as any other electronic shavers. It can be a little messy and it is best used in the bathroom, over the sink or bathtub. It is NOT cordless, and DOES NOT operate on batteries. which is probably better. That way, you know you have no chance of shaving half way and running out to buy batteries!  In terms of the pain tolerance, it is probably best if you tried it on your legs where it is not as painful as your underarms. It does not do the greatest job if you&#x27;re comparing this to waxing. you will have to use a tweezer here and there for the smaller hairs. It can be a pain to clean the hairs out. The product comes with a small brush that you can use to brush out the smaller hairs that are stuck in the shaver. it comes off in 3 parts, making it a little easier to clean.   what the epilator actually looks like is a shaver with no blades, but to replace it, is a bunch of small tweezers that pulls your hair from the roots. so is it painful? of course it is. just like waxing! does it gives you the smooth effect if you&#x27;re comparing it to waxing? No.   If you&#x27;re asking for smooth hairless legs and underarms, stick with waxing. But if you just need it to groom yourself for casual outings, this would do the trick.   your skin will get irritated a little after using it so make sure you apply lotion after you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> This machine is not like the previous one, or maybe mine didn&#x27;t come in good condition. It&#x27;s very noisy and annoyning. It didn&#x27;t have the pink case to put it on it either. Try to get a different one.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a month, and I can say that it&#x27;s really great! My first time epilating- I have never waxed, just shaved- and I didn&#x27;t think it hurt, at all! It&#x27;s a little loud but it works great!</li>
    <li> I used Epilator for the first time to shave my legs hair and it worked very well. It was not very painful. I&#x27;m happy that I didn&#x27;t have to shave again for another week and half! The downside is that when I tried to shave my underartms hair and it was very painful, and I bled a little bit. Anyway, I recommend this product for your legs.</li>
    <li> This product works well on some areas of the body but not others. I find this rather curious but nonetheless, rather true. It works well on the stomach and bikini line, but not the legs.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in wonderment and I love it!  I starting on spots on my legs, at first it hurt but that&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t using it right, when I figured it out it ended up more tingling.  It took a few hours to do my legs, armpits and arms, but only because it was the first time doing it.  I upkeep once a week and it takes less than 5 minutes.  Worst part was my bikini line, but ultimately it only hurt during (takes a minute, so worth the pain) and not after at all but instead of having to shave every day, the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for weeks.  When I got goosebumps there was no stubble, it was wonderful. And if you have a tattoo, this is nothing...&lt;br /&gt;08/06/10 UPDATE:  LOVE IT STILL. Easy to clean, very little maintenance.  Hair grows back way thinner and can go a week without having to touch up (i get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs if I shave).  Spend less time in the shower, no money on razors, which is nice because I save money overall.  I still hate doing my bikini line, but I got a numbing cream and that helps, but when I only have to do it once a week and don&#x27;t get annoying stubble, SO WORTH IT.  I was intimidated for years to use a product like this, but if you give it a chance (use it like 6-8 times), you&#x27;ll love it too.  Would recommend for first timers, Shave the area you want to use it on, then the next day use it, and the next day, for about 3-4 days.  This helps ease into the product and doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair at once so you&#x27;re not in a ton of pain, each hair grows at a different pace, so you&#x27;ll get a chance to get them all.  Then go to once or twice a week after that. Easy Peasy.... ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Do not order from The Natural Health Shoppe. They have deceptive and false advertising and beyond poor customer service. My wife ordered a new Braun Silk SoftPerfection epilator. She received a box that was already open with pieces missing. When she contacted the company, she was told that the missing pieces weren&#x27;t specifically listed on the product page, therefore, she wouldn&#x27;t receive them. They neglected to comment on the fact that they sent a product that wasn&#x27;t new even though she ordered a new product. Had the product been new and unopened as ordered, the missing pieces would have been present. According to their return policy, the product cannot be returned since it has been opened, so they succeeded in pawning off a used and incomplete item. I hope Amazon will not associate with this vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> This epilator is the best I have ever used.  Much less painful than the original Epilady and more powerful than the cordless ones I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s fast and it really does work on the underarms!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product, it is working for me better than any other product I used.  just one thing I feel that is missing with the product which is a bag to keep the product or carry it.</li>
    <li> it effectively remove the hair on arm and underarm, with no pain at all (at least for me).</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have tried for hair removal in a long time.  I had purchased an Epilady and used it till its recent demise and never thought anything could replace it.  Although it was VERY painful to use, the hair grew back very fine and scarce, the longer you used it, improving the hair texture over time.  I then used shavers, cremes, lotions, epil-stop and all were worthless products.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have the Braun, I am ecstatic with the results, it is much quicker and virtually painless compared to the original Epilady.  I highly recommend to women who do not want to become a slave to daily razor shaving!</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit after having read many conflicting reviews, some stating it was very painful, to little or no pain.    It seemed from this site and several others that the consensus was that there is pain associated with it, but tolerable depending on your pain threshold.&lt;br /&gt;Boy was that wrong!  I have a very high pain threshold and found using this to be so painful that I had to stop after a 1/2 hour.  During that time, I was able to remove hair from an area the size of 2 sq inches.  Every comment about the process being slow is true.  Because it still had not removed all the hair in that area.&lt;br /&gt;I tried going slow, fast, adjusting the angle, using both speeds, and none of those things made it any better.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, and don&#x27;t torture yourself like I did!</li>
    <li> if you think a tattoo doesn&#x27;t hurt, then you&#x27;ll be fine with the level of \\&quot;discomfort\\&quot; from this. i have 2 tattoos, and honestly, the sensation is very similar, though it is true that it hurts less and less as you use it. the pain is not my biggest problem, however; it takes FAR TOO LONG! it is impossible to epi your legs in under an hour. it is necessary to go over and over (and OVER!) an area to remove all unwanted hair. moreover, i got tons of ingrown hairs- not exactly the smooth look i was expecting.&lt;BR&gt;you&#x27;re better off shaving with a mach 3 disposable razor, even if you have to do it every day.</li>
    <li> It was difficult to get used to at first. But after a while your skin gets used to it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Do not let the hair get too long!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a tip for first timers: grow the hair out, get it waxed at a salon and only start using this when the hair starts growing back. Or shave and only use this as the stubble grows in. Do not let the hair get too long - that&#x27;s when it is uncomfortable. This get&#x27;s teeny tiny hairs and lasts for as long as waxing -- my legs are so smooth and pretty now.&lt;br /&gt;Caution -- you can&#x27;t go back to shaving or you&#x27;ll get ingrown hairs. Exfoliate regularly, too.</li>
    <li> After my old faithful 10 year old Phillips Satinelle broke, I did a lot of research before buying this baby from Amazon. No shaver for me, thanks, just the epilator. When you have dark and somewhat coarse hair on your legs, shaving is the last thing to do- you get itchy stubble and have to shave daily. I must say the Silk-epil has been working admirably. The roller/massager gizmo does work to deaden the pain. My old Satinelle hurt like crazy but I kept thinking you have to suffer for beauty, right? Well, there is a LOT less suffering with the Silk-epil. But beware, if your skin is dry the massager beads will leave faint scratch marks. Exfoliating and moisturizing is important when you epilate, but it&#x27;s good practice to do it anyway. &lt;br /&gt;Since the epilator removes hair from the roots, even the hairiest among you should be able to go for at least 3 weeks between sessions. It takes significantly longer than shaving, but trust me that it is well worth it. &lt;br /&gt;The epilator comes with a carrying case and cleaning brush. Clean everything scrupulously to protect yourself from any infections. It should last for years with good care.</li>
    <li> Basically, what this product does is it pulls your hair out one by one (or maybe 4-5 at a time).  And you can look forward to more in-grown hair than you thought was possible.&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Oh yeah it works alright.  It really &amp;quot;works&amp;quot; and regardless of the lenght of hair it will pull it out from the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt?  More than you can imagine!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re hairy, you&#x27;re in for a painful ride.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a few weeks. During this time I have used it on my underarms, legs, and bikini area. I was pretty impressed with the unit&#x27;s performance on my underarm area. It got almost all of the hair; it could not remove hair in areas where I could not stretch the skin to make it completely flat. The smoothness lasted about one week and when the hair grew back it was noticably lighter.&lt;br /&gt;On my legs, I was very disappointed. I would run the product slowly over both of my legs, only to realize hours later that large areas of hair had been missed. I went over my legs with the device several more times, and was still never satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;With regards to the bikini areas, again I was less-than-satisfied. My hair there does not stick straight up, as it does on my underarms and legs, so the unit could not grab any of the hair. It was definitely long enough, but I found that I had to pluck a lot of the left over hair. The product is better than shaving, certainly, but I think I will stick with waxing until an improved version of this product comes out.&lt;br /&gt;Since it removed *almost* all of my underarm hair, I gave it three stars despite its other deficiencies. Smooth underarms are a must during the summer months and I would have paid almost this much ($30) for one waxing!</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I expected there to be some pain, as I have waxed before and I also pluck my eyebrows so I know what it feels like to have all your hair ripped out all at once. But I was quite surprised after I did it for the first time, it hurt but it wasn&#x27;t terrible, just felt like well having each hair ripped out which is what it does. After that it has gotten much better, hurts alot less and the hair grows back slowly and much softer and less noticeable. Though only once an awhile my legs will be really soft but for the most part they never really feel soft. Maybe lotion would helpt after epilating, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet and I&#x27;ve had this product since January, but with the warm weather just starting I might try some lotion to see if it helps. But all in all it works great, I go over my legs maybe once a week to get the hair that wasn&#x27;t long enough the first time, the results for me last a couple of weeks then I have to do it again. My hair has always grown back very fast though, so results may be different for everyone. But this is a great product for the money spent, my mother is thinking of buying one as well! Hope this review helps. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this Braun epilator a few months ago, and it was probably the best money I have ever spent, hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it was a little difficult to use pain-wise, but that factor quickly becomes irrelevant once you see your legs/underarm/bikini line smooth and hair free for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I did it, I cringed (A LOT) but got over it relatively quickly.  Honestly, there is no need for the \\&quot;pre-epilating wipes\\&quot; or anything like that at all.  Just simply exfoliate all over and don&#x27;t put lotion on, the tweezers won&#x27;t be able to grab it if the hair is that smooth.  Second-make sure your hair is long enough to grab...but keep in mind that the longer the hair it, the more it seems to hurt as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another hint:  make yourself a nice glass of wine or have a cocktial or two prior to doing any of this (if you are of age, of course!)  It definitely helps take the edge off, but I didn&#x27;t tell you that!  Also, avoid epilating for the first time if it is \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot; if possible.  You will be a lot more \\&quot;aware\\&quot; of the pain, and it definitely isn&#x27;t a pleasant experience.  I ordered numbing lotion, which has worked WONDERS, and really makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, I use a cotton ball to put the numbing lotion on so my hands don&#x27;t go all numb as well.  This is especially helpful when doing the bikini/underarm area.  Keep in mind that the first time you do under your arms, it WILL hurt.  There is simply no way of getting around this.  Also, it is a good reminder to not use any deodorant for the next few days that will irritate your skin.  You might notice small red bumps the first time you do it, and those will go away very soon, by the next day or so at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning on epilating for a special event, or something as such, I DO NOT recommend epilating the day before for the first time.  Your skin WILL need time to adjust to this, and you need to get used to it as well.  I can assure you that once you become accustomed to the feeling, it will go away rather soon, and even (dare I say) become a LOT less painful with each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can proudly say that I have not used a single razor or shaving cream (or any other of those products for that matter) in roughly 6 months now.  I notice that my entire body is a lot smoother, and I have to epilate less and less...&lt;br /&gt;Legs:  Approximately every 1.5-2 months&lt;br /&gt;Under Arms: 2 months&lt;br /&gt;Bikini:  About once a month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will also notice that the hair will start growing in finer and finer with each use.  The reasoning is that when you shave, you are cutting the hair off at the top, as opposed to pulling it out at the root (like you do with epilating.)  So basically when you epilate, the hair has to completely fill back in the follicle and that takes time.  It grows in just like it is growing in for the first time, not \\&quot;cut off\\&quot; at the ends, as you do with shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After epilating, I prefer to use a gel that prevents ingrown hairs from epilating, although I haven&#x27;t had any real issues with this; it is pretty much a preventative step in which I am being overly-cautious.  You can use any ingrown hair prevention step of your choice, although this is not necessary at all if you do not typically have a problem with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep the area clean (this should go without saying) and enjoy your long-lasting smooth legs/bikini/under arm area as long as you like!  I know this product has flat out been amazing for me, and I&#x27;m MORE than happy I found it!  I am currently in Iraq, and there aren&#x27;t exactly a lot of \\&quot;beauty options\\&quot; of being out here, and it really makes a huge difference to feel like a girl again, and this gives you a lot less to worry about, and saves you a lot of time and money in the long run-much more than you would ever save on shaving, shaving creams, replacement razors, etc.  Plus, even though it takes a little less time to shave, keep in mind that the little extra time you spend epilating will save you a lot of time from having to shave for quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the hair grow out a bit prior to epilating, so the tweezers have enough to grab onto (a little less than you would for a waxing.)  Here are some extra tips as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs:  Brace yourself for some spots that are a little more sensitive than others (such as around the ankles, behind the knees, thighs, etc.)  Some areas you may need to go over a few times, but be patient-it is completely worth it in the end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under Arms:  This may seem a little strange, but bear with me: when epilating this part, do not go in just one direction.  It has been my experience that the hair in this area DOES NOT grow in just one direction, so try running the epilator vertically both ways, as well as horizontally both ways to ensure you cover all angles.  You might be surprised at the amount of hair you pick up while doing this that you didn&#x27;t even know was there.  This area will be sensitive, so take care when putting on deodorant.  Do not use anything that is not to be used on \\&quot;broken skin\\&quot; as this is pretty much what your skin is considered right after you do this.  You are literally ripping the hair from the follicle, (no matter how morbid that sounds!) so be careful.  I made the mistake of using Certain Dri right after I epilated one time, and it was not a pleasant feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini:  NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!  First of all, this was not an easy talk to complete; it takes patience, a threshold for pain that would rival any superhero, and a lot of practice.  I recommend trimming the area prior to epilating to reduce pain, as well as taking a painkiller (aspirin, ibuprofen,etc) about an hour or two prior to ensure that the pain/swelling isn&#x27;t as much as it would normally be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator comes with two settings, along with a detachable \\&quot;head\\&quot; that I have since thrown away due to never using it.  They say that it helps \\&quot;prepare\\&quot; the hairs for epilation, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference whatsoever and quite frankly-don&#x27;t need it.  I typically use the fasters setting to epilate, as I have gotten used to it by now, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I do recommend that you start out on the first setting though, and gradually work your way up, keeping in mind the \\&quot;no pain, no gain\\&quot; phrase.  I just like prefer the faster setting because it hurts a lot less now that I&#x27;m used to it, as well as makes the process go a lot faster as it grabs a lot more hairs that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer stated that you can&#x27;t shave again after using this or you will get ingrown hairs: I can not comment on that, as I have not tried to shave after epilating-because I don&#x27;t feel the need to.  The epilator takes care of everything I need, therefore the need to shave anything is eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a little &#x27;cleaning brush&#x27; which I use quite a bit.  You will notice after epilating an area with a lot of hairs that it \\&quot;fills up\\&quot; the inside-this is definitely good to keep clean, especially for sanitary reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and enjoy your new hair free days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hannahe extra time you spend epilating will save you a lot of time from having to shave for quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the hair grow out a bit prior to epilating, so the tweezers have enough to grab onto (a little less than you would for a waxing.)

    <li> I remember trying out my mom&#x27;s old epilator when I was younger- you know, the kind with the vibrating springs. It was so painful, I only lasted a few seconds. Fast forward, and I&#x27;m tired of spending ungodly amounts of money on wax, so I decide to give this guy a try. I have PCOS, so am generally very embarrassed by my body hair.     Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, the first time you use this, it will hurt like hell. More than waxing hurts, because it&#x27;s slower. The first time, shave a few days beforehand, then go slowly over your skin. After a couple of weeks, the hair starts to grow back, finer than before. Epilating doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly so much after that, and it takes a lot less time. I like the attachments for doing more sensitive areas, where you might get scared of putting the machine right against your skin, but for most areas, I don&#x27;t use them.     The first time I used it, I broke out all over my body. Between that and the pain, I was ready to give up. Since then, I haven&#x27;t broken out, it hurts a lot less, and I can get rid of hair much more quickly.    I love this epilator so much that when I found myself on business in the Middle East, I ended up buying myself another one just for the three months that I&#x27;m here.</li>
    <li> Unlike other models I tried, this Silk-epil epilator is not a good product. It is not suitable for sensitive zones (although the box speaks to the contrary) and it is extremely noisy. When using it is impossible to do anything else, because the noise is so high that it even gives you a head-ache. I would definitely not recommend this product, because is not even cheap.</li>
    <li> For any women struggling with too much unwanted hair on their legs, there is no better product. I won&#x27;t lie, it hurts a bit but after the first time it gets better. The tips are to do it right after you take a shower and when your hair is not too long. It&#x27;s better than messy at-home waxing and shaving every day, you avoid the stubble and it feels as smooth as a professional wax, without the cost. I lived in Europe for a number of years, most women there use it and I was always disappointed that the US didn&#x27;t have an equivalent product. I am so happy to find an epillator here at last!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product and I have been using this for 2 years now. Even though it takes time it gives a nice smooth finish like that of waxing. But for people with thick hair and ingrowth have to take caution as it will hurt a lot, it wont be able to remove the ingrowth and it leaves temporary red marks. It is for people with thin and less hair growth.Do it for an hour for every week for best results.</li>
    <li> This product is great and money saving. I used to wax and use creams but thanks to this epilator I am hair free for almost three weeks at a time. If I need to fix a spot, its just a quick two minute thing. Really mess free and smell free. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great. I&#x27;ve used a Braun epilator for a couple of years now and purchased this model for my 13 yr old daughter. It&#x27;s been comfortable for her right from the first use. (Hint: Shave with a razor before the first use, then use the epilator on new growth. Long hair hurts!) I use this epilator on my legs, underarms, and on the bikini area. The bikini area is most tender and will take getting used to. It&#x27;s worth it, though, because there will be no rash nor ingrown hairs. After repeated use, hair grows back thinner each time and now, after 2 years, I hardly have to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; at all. With the few hairs that do grow back, I can literally pull them out with my fingers because the follicles are so loose. Initially, you&#x27;ll feel the action and some discomfort, but after a few uses, there is zero pain and now I actually have to look to verify that I even \\&quot;shaved\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/20/12: This is still the best product! Both of my Braun epilators have been been working in perfect condition for YEARS! The hair on my body is barely visible now. I won&#x27;t even realize that I haven&#x27;t used it in a while unless I catch my legs in just the right light to see the wispy hairs. It&#x27;s so soft on my legs that I have to take the guard off to get close enough to the skin to grab the fine hairs. I don&#x27;t even have to bring it with me on vacations because I won&#x27;t need it for at least 2 weeks. Even then, it&#x27;s mostly just under my arms where the hair is still courser than on my legs. I do a Brazilian wax-style on my bikini line, and as long as I keep up with that 2x-4x per month, the pain is minimal. It&#x27;s still sensitive if I let it go a month, though. I&#x27;ll have to brace myself for the first few minutes, but then the pain subsides as the hair is removed. By the way, it doesn&#x27;t take any longer than using a razor for me. Less, actually, because I don&#x27;t need water and shaving cream, and all the clean-up time/mess.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator hoping it would last longer than shaving.  It is comfortable, easy to use, and otherwise a good product.  However, my leg hairs, while dark, are pretty fine.  They mostly broke off instead of being pulled off, so I got stubbly again quickly.  It&#x27;d be better for someone with coarser hair.  Exfoliate before, and moisturize after, and you should be fine.    One last tip:  the pain is noticeable, but not unbearable.  However, the pain is worse if you focus on it.  This will sound crazy, but play your favorite obnoxious pop song and sing along loudly to it as you epilate.  It helps mitigate the pain :)</li>
    <li> The shaver is wonderful and practically painless unlike my previous Remington.  A great value for the money, and much smoother.</li>
    <li> I love the epilator! I&#x27;ve never used another brand, so I couldn&#x27;t compare. Using it on the under arms weren&#x27;t bad at all, as I read previously from reviewers. The only gripe I had, was the actual Braun package seemed open and it appears I may be missing the little brush (not so sure if it comes with it, but looks like it should from the manual). using this fancy device has become an addiction!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try it out and loved it.  I love that it saves on razors and shaving cream. Wherever we use it, our skin feels so soft bec there are no hairs, they were pulled out of the root. My daughter uses it and I recently purchased two more for my sisters who love it. It&#x27;s a great gift idea for any female who shaves.  I am going to purchase 3 more to give as gifts as suggested my sister bec she loves the product.</li>
    <li> This new Braun is not as good as my last one.  Besides being much louder, the rotating heads don&#x27;t take out some of the roots as did the old one; it merely chops off hairs instead of yanking the hairs by the roots.  I get more bumps under my skin as a result.  It&#x27;s new but not improved!</li>
    <li> I do not like shaving, and this epilator is great for the price, 15 days without having to epilate again, very soft legs. Do not use it for the bikini line, too hard on it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to replace her old elilady that was worn out. She says the Braun Epilator works better (faster) runs smother and is better than the epilady was, when it was new. She is very happy with the purchase she was even kicking herself for not buying something new sooner. I wont say how I came to be aware the old epilady was warn out but I got brownie points for making the purchase.   A happy wife is not the only benefit ;-)</li>
    <li> This epilator is small and easy to use. It&#x27;s not very efficient though, because your hair grows back in a few days, it&#x27;s not picking up the hairs from the roots well. Otherwise it&#x27;s pain free and cute.</li>
    <li> I had similar model for 25 years, the best. The new one is good. And anybody new to this product will find it very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> i got this after having an emjoi for 10 yrs that finally broke. it&#x27;s honestly not bad, especially considering that it&#x27;s half the price. sometimes it only manages to cut the hairs, not yank them out, but i found that with the emjoi, that happened too. so far, no real complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using various models for the past 7 years and cannot live without it.  I hate waxing and hardly have the time and patience for it.  The silk epil saves me a lot of time.  If you use it on hair that is not too long, it doesn&#x27;t hurt very much.  The only thing it doesn&#x27;t prevent is in-grown hairs.</li>
    <li> I have waxed my legs for the past ten years, so needless to say- pain is not an issue. That said, I was very happy with the epil because it takes at least half the time compared to waxing...that&#x27;s like two legs for the time of one! It&#x27;s also much easier than waxing- just plug her in and go. The negative difference I saw was that I needed to exfoliate more in the shower to prep for the next round of epilating. It seems that waxing removes more dead skin while the epil solely removes the hairs. Also, it seemed like some of the hairs broke off at the skin, making them grow back in at a faster rate than the hairs that were fully pulled by the roots. This resulted in a light but early crop of hair succeeded by another later harvest. Nonetheless, my goal is as little maintenance as possible and this seems to trump both razors and waxes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 3 years ago, my cousin had gotten one and I decided to try it out. I am completely compulsive when it comes to hair, I hate anything that has to do it. I have EVERYTHING you can think of in my house for hair removal, and when I bought this product, it was the one with the best result. Sure, it is a little painful, but, bikini waxes are far more painful and expensive. It also lasts for about a week, and my hairs have gotten thinner. Overall, don&#x27;t think about getting this product, JUST DO IT! It&#x27;s effective, quick, and super easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun Epilator before and meant to purchase this one before but was given the wrong one as a gift. This one totally kicks arse over my previous one I had to leave in Australia when I moved to the US.  My legs are really sensitive and the little prongs on this one take away the pain where as the previous prongs were more for show - well detract from the pain as I haven&#x27;t used an epilator in 6 months - double ouch! I have no problem with bikini but getting back into the underarm groove is a bit painful - OUCH!!    My only whinge is this one didn&#x27;t come with a little pouch to put everything away in which I thought was standard.      I LOVE this epilator and if you can stand the pain for a wee while you do get used to it... Deep breathing helps at times!!!</li>
    <li> I found this epilator to be as effective as promised. Sure it was painful at first, but I think I&#x27;ve gotten more accustomed to it the more I use it. Sometimes the hairs break instead of being pulled out. Overall though, I&#x27;m nice and smooth for about 4 weeks and the hair that grows back is much lighter and more fine. I have used it on my legs and armpits and I would recommend it for anyone who really wants less hassle in those areas. It&#x27;s fast, easy, and a friend who is used to waxing found it completely painless. I&#x27;m a bit of a wuss, but even so, I am glad I decided to get this product.</li>
    <li> I had before the old model, very similar to this one, which was very noisy. This new redesign is less noisy and the adaptor is a lot more lighter and smaller. Some people say that it causes a lot of pain. Maybe at the very begining, but after the third use it is fine. Just do not let the hairs to grow so long if you don&#x27;t want to get watery eyes (^-^). The only disadvantage is that it didn&#x27;t come with a pouch, not a big deal though. Overall I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before - frankly, I thought it sounded like a whole lot of pain. But as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;m finding that I shave more frequently and that I&#x27;m getting darker hair in places that used to be blonde.    I used it for the first time last night on my legs and face.    Before I started, I washed, exfoliated and dried off the areas to epilate.    I started on my legs, with the massaging clip in place. It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected, but it took a LOT of passes to get the hair, and I ended up with a LOT of raised bumps where it took multiple tugs to finally pull the hair loose. Once I removed the massaging clip and replaced it with the speed clip, it was a totally different experience - it was a little more painful, but a LOT faster, and much more hair came out on the first pass. That area had much fewer bumps.    After that, I used it (with the speed clip) along my jawline to remove some darker hair that has recently appeared there. Ugh. It was painful, but not enough to bring tears to my eyes. The skin left behind was a little red, but no raised bumps, and baby smooth.     Once I was done, I smoothed on some witch hazel and salicylic acid to prevent breakouts and some soothing lotion with aloe to help with the redness. This morning, I still have some red spots on my legs, but my face looks totally normal.    It&#x27;s painful, but not terribly so, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it as I use it more. The biggest downside is that it&#x27;s LOUD... so loud, in fact, that even with the doors closed, it woke my daughter sleeping 2 rooms away.     Next time I&#x27;ll use the downstairs bathroom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington epilator for years, but then I decided to give Braun a try. It was very slow, I had to go over and over each spot, as it was leaving a lot of hair behind - I tried it with the Efficiency Pro clip which did not help. It did not hurt much, but then I am used to epilating. Can be used on bikini line as well as legs, I didn&#x27;t try it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I received in the mail today, ordered on Sat PM, and quickly, I tried it out. I was disappointed that there are no instructions on how to attach the...other piece. I forgot the name. I wanted to see how that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first epilator and it STUNG like a MOFO but I got used to it after a while. I still have tiny strands of hair, which I will shave off, after my epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I guess nothing is out for HAIRY BEASTS, like myself!! I am afraid to use it under my arms! Bikini line wasn&#x27;t that bad - but then again, I recently had a wax, so there wasn&#x27;t much going on down there!</li>
    <li> This epilator works as described- I used it on my legs and the hair took almost three weeks to grow back, and even then it was finer. It does sting, and is a little time consuming. I also experienced some ingrown hairs, but I probably didn&#x27;t exfoliate enough. I will use this before vacations or other times when I don&#x27;t want to be bothered with shaving every other day.</li>
    <li> This is just like using an electric razor.  It is a wonderful product!! It&#x27;s NOT, repeat, NOT painful.  It really does leave you hair free for weeks. I have used it on my chin, legs and underarms and had NO PROBLEM. I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. I know the first editions of this were a nightmere and were very painful AND didn&#x27;t really get all the hair..this, again, is not painful and does a very good just..just like shaving but last longer and closer!  Buy it today!!!</li>
    <li> I used to wax my legs and this was messy and painful. I love using this braun it&#x27;s like an electric razor but better. With the results of waxing and no mess! I give it an A+.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other brands of epilators and this by far was the least painful one.  I think it is because of the massaging rollers.  I was able to do a whole leg in one sitting on the first try which I couldn&#x27;t even think about with other devices.&lt;br /&gt;It does hurt some, mostly around the ankles.  I would recommend waxing most of the hair once before you use this.  Even an at home wax kit is fine, it doesn&#x27;t have to me perfect.  Also, the instructions recommend that you start at the bottom of the leg and work your way up but the opposite is less painful for me.  By the time I get to the very sensitive ankle area, my legs are more used to the sensation.  Works great on your pits but again, you should wax first.</li>
    <li> This is a great epilator. I used another elpilator brand before this one, but I think this is better. And its not too expensive. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I use to go through razors a lot. I bought battery powered shavers and it became a bit pricey. I like the Braun Soft Perfection Epilator even though I have to shave a little longer. It is worth not having to shave as often as I did before.</li>
    <li> i received it two days before the assigned day which was great!  the product itself works wonders :)  looking at the same product up on some other online stores, i couldn&#x27;t believe how much money i saved.  it does hurt very much on your first three trials but later, you get used to it so it isn&#x27;t as painful.  the hair won&#x27;t grow back for at least two or three weeks which saves me alot of time! i would definitely recommend this to others and believe me, try it once and you will love it forever!</li>
    <li> I would say that the epilator definitely works for the thicker hairs on my legs and body, but not well for finer hairs, such as on my thighs, etc. It never gets all of the hairs unless I spend a LONG time on it, but I use it regularly for my legs (about every week), and then shave in between if I need a smooth day for some special occasion. The epilator does get a little warm if I run it for a long time, but it hasn&#x27;t been much of a problem. I definitely like it and would recommend it, even though it isn&#x27;t perfect to keep you perfectly smooth.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit painful at the beginning, the pain nulls down - just like waxing I guess.  It&#x27;s a great product.  After the first time I used it on my legs, it caught all my hair, although I still felt some little fine hairs that were left behind.  It also didn&#x27;t do a very good job at getting the thigh area because the hair doesn&#x27;t grow as thick there.  I did shave after and then my legs were actually smooth for about 2 weeks.  I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it because it&#x27;s so much more convenient than shaving and cheaper than waxing.  The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it does not catch the hair as it pulls them out.  I was doing this in my room and all the hair ended up on my floor.  Next time it will be done in the bathroom!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the epilator for about 1 month, the good part was in my legs, they feel really smooth and don&#x27;t have any in-growth like I used to when I shaved. The bad part were my underarms, apparently they are kind of sensible so they were red for about a week and in one I even got small cuts from the tweezers pulling my skin...seen that I wasn&#x27;t sure about the bikini area, so I tried in a small zone and wasn&#x27;t bad. At least I got 2 out of 3 zones, and the pain is not that bad (a lot of the reviews had me prepare for the most painful experience of my life), kind of a prickling feeling even in the underarms.  I guess you&#x27;ll be better by first testing how your skin reacts to the massive pulling of the hairs and then go for the whole zone!</li>
    <li> It is painful... iam not going to lie... but it gets the job done!!!! and takes for ever to the hair grow back.  When the hair comes is thinner and weaker!!!!  LOVE the product.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  At first I used it every day or two, and now I use it once or twice a week.  It does not make my legs completely smooth, but I have noticed MUCH less hair growing now (at least half the hair!), so it&#x27;s permanently removing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really important to exfoliate when using this, to avoid ingrown hairs.  I have gotten a few, but once I started exfoliating regularly, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/23/2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this and have continued to notice much less leg hair.  When my leg hair does grow out after several days, I can&#x27;t even see much hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a huge difference - I used to get stubble in the afternoon after shaving in the morning!  and I could see lots of black dots.  I had to shave at least once a day, and now I can go days without shaving or using the epilator.  I use it about 1-2 times a week still.  I am so glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> I used this for 2 years, when I first started epilating.  First, throw away the \\&quot;massage\\&quot; attachment - it just prevents you from getting at all the hairs.  Second, it will hurt some the first few times, but after a while the hair grows softer and sparser and then it doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  I&#x27;ve used this on my legs (very limited discomfort), my underarms (mild discomfort but SMOOTH and no stubble) and my upper lip (zowie!), but it&#x27;s still completely worth it.  I used to shave my legs a couple of times a week and quickly regrow coarse stubble.  In the beginning with this epilator my legs would be quite red and itchy after (there was a lot to coarse hair to remove), but now I only epilate once a week and get very few marks and almost no discomfort.  The reason I give this only 3 stars is that I would often have to go over the same area a few times to get all the hair, and that seemed to be more of an issue after 2 years of use.  I recently upgraded to a more expensive model here on Amazon ([[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]]), and it works faster and is even more comfortable than this one, so if you can swing it, go for the pricier one.  If you just want to try it without the financial committment, this one is fine.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product for a month now I didn&#x27;t want to knock it before I gave it a chance. Here it goes #1 time consuming you really have to have so much time on your hands to remove the unwanted hair, #2 ingrown hair like crazy even if you exfoliate during warm showers, #3 skin is never ever smooth feels prickly like when hair grows back after a few days after shaving, #4 you have to repeatedly go over one spot to get rid of most of the hair, #5 the protective cover always I mean always falls off, #6 OMG the bikini area and upper thighs hurts like crazzzzy it feels like bees stinging you over and over I can bare pain but not that kind of pain, and I have waxed my bikini area before. Over all this product is a waste of time and money I wonder if I can return it and get my money back after a month well I need to check up on that.</li>
    <li> My 35 year old + epilady died a few weeks ago. I suggested to my husband that a replacement would be nice for Mother&#x27;s Day (and I even did the research and comparison) and he got me this Braun wonderful replacement.  Yes it is quiet, effective and compared to my old one, NO pain at all. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked, how soft my legs are (could not find any left over hairs even with a magnifying glass as these 65 year old eyes need some help once in a while) and how easy it was to clean.  Can&#x27;t find anything but good to say about this.  But to be fair, at my age, I have less leg hair and it is much less coarse than when I was young so I can only review based on my current status.  But I am guessing that it would work well under any condition.   I am 100% pleased!</li>
    <li> Simply put, don&#x27;t buy this.  I have tried over 15 epilators and this one is at the bottom of my list. It does not grasp very well nor pull the hair very well.  I am not very hairy and I would say my hair is fine to medium.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product as far as epilators go.  It hurts about as much as the others and is just as loud, but it works well (and that&#x27;s the point, isn&#x27;t it?)</li>
    <li> I have used many epilators for many years, this is the worst ever. I have to use it every other day because is just like shaving. Dont&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Braun Soft Perfection SE3170 Epilator, Pink is an excellent performance, cute and easy to handle.  The best hair remover for ever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a common epilator. You can&#x27;t expect of it to do too much (hint: its price). I don&#x27;t have much to say. As long as it does its job, it&#x27;s okay. Buy it as a basic staple.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using an epilator.  I read in reviews for this and other epilators that they sometimes break hair off just below the surface of the skin, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyway.  That is exactly what happened.  It probably only pulls out about 50% of my leg hair at the root and the rest just breaks off.         The good thing is that if you continue to epilate the hair that grows back, more gets pulled out at the root each time, and it&#x27;s less painful because there is less hair.  I have to repeat at least once a week though to maintain smooth legs.  I&#x27;ve also found that if shave in addition to epilating, my legs are really smooth and they stay that way for about a week.      I tried a little patch on my armpit and it actually seemed to work better there than on leg hair.  You have to be really careful to keep your skin as taught as possible though, or you can really hurt yourself.        Since this was my first epilator, I&#x27;m not sure if it dosen&#x27;t work as well as it should or if I just have really fragile leg hair.  I will probably try another brand to see if it works better.      I would definitely recommend epilating to waxing, it hurts a lot less.  And if you combine it with shaving, it helps your legs stay smoother for longer.</li>
    <li> I like the older model of the Braun Silk epil.  I don&#x27;t like the new style head of this model.  It is more painful to use.</li>
    <li> For as cheap as this was I believe around 60 bucks. It does the job and it gets to the point. There is no need to go and purchase the 100+ epilators they all end up doing the same thing just some are advertised fanicer than ever. If you just want a a epilator to pull your hairs out in unwanted places and for a reasonable price. go with this!</li>
    <li> At first, it hurts.  Then, it starts to feel good.  But most importantly, my legs don&#x27;t have to be shaved every day anymore.  They aren&#x27;t as silky as when I used a razor, but they also don&#x27;t get such super sharp stubble.</li>
    <li> Great Tool!!! It does not hurt almost. I love it. I bought this Silk Epil3 Soft perfection and I am so impressed with the quality and price. The delivery was fast. I am a super happy customer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this a gift for my wife and she is very satisfied and happy with this.It works as expected and the delivery was on time.My wife Will recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for ages and I have to say this one is extremely easy to use with very little pain. If you have extremely thick and dense hair, then you&#x27;d certainly want to do small areas at a time, giving your skin some relief. Having said that, you&#x27;d have to have really sensitive skin or a very low pain threshold to find this uncomfortable. I think the average person would not find it uncomfortable at all.</li>
    <li> This product has left my legs completely scarred. It is horrible! I exfoliated regularly to prevent ingrowns but had a problem anyway, then they started getting infected and left horrible scars all over even months after I stopped epilating. You may think you will save time by not having shave everyday, but its not worth it and the epilator never even worked that well anyway. It looked like my skin was smooth when i used it, but to the touch i was still very spikey! Don&#x27;t waste your money, spare your skin and stick to shaving. You will be happy you did!!!</li>
    <li> Does the job, not hearts too much, efficient, fast, or in one word - wonderful!!!    To make thing clear - I use it everywhere...!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! For anyone who remembers the torture device from the &#x27;80 called Epilady, this couldn&#x27;t be more different. No pain (it like using and electric shaver)and the hair is gone for weeks. That being said, I haven&#x27;t tried it on my under arms yet, where most women felt pain.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This may be an amazing product- but it hurts like crazy. Basically an epilator is a machine with multiple rotating tweezers. You run the machine over your legs (or wherever) and the tweezer claws grab the hairs and pull  them out. Some people may not be bothered by this, but I found it almost unbearable. I tried taking pain medication before using this and it didn&#x27;t help much. It really hurts.     Also, this machine is very noisy and makes a loud buzzing/grinding noise. I think that makes it even more intimidating.     However the effects were GREAT on the parts I did complete. It lasts at least twice as long as shaving and is much less messy than waxing. Also, I think this Epilator is very well designed. I love the color and it is quite easy to clean.     You have to have quite a bit of courage to use this, but if you do the results are great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does the job... bought it for my wife and she&#x27;s very happy with it.... don&#x27;t buy the upgraded models as having a light in the machine is not worth to pay an additional $40. all braun brands does the same great job. so u might as well save money by buying this basic model which works like a champ (German Engineering) don&#x27;t buy the panasonic or any other kinds. paid $27 for it and at this price it&#x27;s not a deal it&#x27;s a STEAL.</li>
    <li> Efficient, effective - have owned 2 of these by Braun - the first one ever created (5+years old) and this, which I bought for my niece as a gift. It take some getting used to, but works great.</li>
    <li> Just to let you guys know, I bought this at a walgreens on sale for like 20 bucks. Granted, this was a few years ago, and I haven&#x27;t really used it because it hurts, but still its a little too expensive here.</li>
    <li> Honestly I was expecting it to be so much more painful than the earlier reviews made it seem. Does it hurt? yes. But I would classify it more as a painful prickle that can be dealt with at mind over matter. With that being said.. let&#x27;s just say that the thicker the hair is, the more it hurts. At this point I can only use it on my legs. And it never leaves them quite as smooth as shaving but the results last so much longer. Braun has an equal to this product that&#x27;s $20 more because it has an attached light. Originally I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be worth $20 extra for a light but I tried my friend&#x27;s and it helps me find missed hairs sooo much easier. Either way, if you&#x27;re someone who has a fairly normal pain tolerance I think this product will be worth your money.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hurt, It&#x27;s very effective and convenient way of getting rid of the hair on arms and legs. It&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and think more than me. She likes the way takes out the hair, its painless and she is very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I use this product primarily on my underarms (though I use it on my legs sometimes too) and I&#x27;m so happy with the results! Before, I had to shave my underarms everyday and even when I did, it never looked completely clean. Now that I use this epilator, my underarms stay bare for longer and I only have to worry about them once every few weeks.  I will warn people that the first time you use it, it&#x27;s a little more painful than you expect. (Only on my underarms, though, I could barely feel it on my legs) Also, I had slight bleeding the first time I used it, but it all went away very quickly. (Make sure you rub the area down with alcohol afterward!) The more you use it, the less painful it becomes and the nicer the area will look. (The redness goes away faster and faster each time) Just make sure you use this either over a sink or a garbage can or in the tub, because the hair goes pretty much everywhere.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this because now my razor is pretty much obsolete and I don&#x27;t feel so embarrassed lifting up my arms anymore. My only complaint is that I wish it removed more hair at one time because sometimes I have to run the epilator over the area many times before it removes all the hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have tried for hair removal in a long time.  I had purchased an Epilady and used it till its recent demise and never thought anything could replace it.  Although it was VERY painful to use, the hair grew back very fine and scarce, the longer you used it, improving the hair texture over time.  I then used shavers, cremes, lotions, epil-stop and all were worthless products.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have the Braun, I am ecstatic with the results, it is much quicker and virtually painless compared to the original Epilady.  I highly recommend to women who do not want to become a slave to daily razor shaving!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have this item...now is the time to ask for it in your socking.  It was the best purchase I have ever made.  A little painful using it the first time, from that point on, its easy, fast, and painless.  The highlight of this hair removal item is that you don&#x27;t have to shave for weeks.  Hair grows finer and finer with time.  BUY IT NOW!!! ITS GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> great product, if you have 2 hrs...&lt;br /&gt;i excitedly opened this gadget the first few minutes after it arrived. i had read all the reviews on amazon and being that i have been a life-long sufferer of unwanted hair, needless to say, i was excited to start yanking those suckers out.&lt;br /&gt;i had about 3 or 4 days growth on my legs and all the areas i epilated had the same. my hair is thick, dark and coarse. i did my legs, underarms, bikini line and face. keep in mind, this is only day one, and i have never epilated before and have never waxed either. my legs were dry and flaky and i have not showered in the three hours since i did this.&lt;br /&gt;this does seem to take out most of the hairs. i saw it all over the place - on my legs and in the device. it does seem to take it out by the root, too. however, my legs still felt stubbly after using this product for nearly TWO HOURS (on all areas). you need to go over most areas numerous times. the bikini area was impossible to get to, probably because of the angle or something. the underarms hurt like HELL (and even ripped a mole i had there - gross, but true), but i have to say, the results were impressive on my pits. i am leary of going there again due to the mole, but i was most impressed with the results in this area.&lt;br /&gt;areas that were more painful: knees, ankles, underarms (the worst, but had the best results!) and bikini area. least painful: the face and the tops of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;i did my legs all the way up to the underwear line and that took FOREVER. it does take some time to get used to the plucking sensation and whether or not you can tolerate this product really depends on your pain threshold, how coarse your hair is and how badly you want to not shave. when i got done with my legs there were little red bumps all over the place and many areas around my bikini line were bleeding (only a little). i have yet to know what the results will be like in a few days, but for right now, i can&#x27;t say i&#x27;m overly impressed. shaving takes a lot less time and my legs are far smoother with a gillette sensor. the process DID hurt at first, but seems to lessen a tad once you get used to it. it&#x27;s NOT painless and i consider myself to have a high tolerance for pain. i have plucked hair on my face for years and never has it hurt a bit. this HURT (not on the face though), but maybe i&#x27;ll get used to it with more use.&lt;br /&gt;overall, i don&#x27;t know whether or not i am going to keep this product. i don&#x27;t know if amazon would take something like this back anyhow. i do like the results on my underarms, and some of the parts i did on my face (feels like i am a man shaving though!), but the legs are far more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. shaving is quicker, your legs are smoother and i don&#x27;t get little red bumps all over the place. this is definitely an activity you do at night, not something you do right before you slip on a tank top and go outside.&lt;br /&gt;i am conflicted. i&#x27;ll report back in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;ok, it&#x27;s been sold on ebay! on to the next product...takes a lot less time and my legs are far smoother with a gillette sensor. the process DID hurt at first, but seems to lessen a tad once you get used to it. it&#x27;s NOT painless and i consider myself to have a high tolerance for pain. i have plucked hair on my face for years and never has it hurt a bit. this HURT (not on the face though), but maybe i&#x27;ll get used to it with more use.&lt;br /&gt;overall, i don&#x27;t know whether or not i am going to keep this product. i don&#x27;t know if amazon would take something like this back anyhow. i do like the results on my underarms, and some of the parts i did on my face (feels like i am a man shaving though!), but the legs are far more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. shaving is quicker, your legs are smoother and i don&#x27;t get little red bumps all over the place. this is definitely an activity you do at night, not something you do right before you slip on a tank top and go outside.&lt;br /&gt;i am conflicted. i&#x27;ll report back in a few days. &lt;br /&gt;ok, it&#x27;s been sold on ebay! on to the next product...</li>
    <li> This is really a great product! It removes hairs so quickly and efficiently that you&#x27;ll give up shaving in seconds. It hurts only the first time. After that you&#x27;ll even start epilating your underarms or more gentle areas.&lt;BR&gt;Also, AMAZON.COM Customer Service is awesome! You get what you asked for. No problem for replacement if anything goes wrong. &lt;br /&gt;Recommended product&amp;amp;website!</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s Silk-Epil Eversoft happens to be my first epilator and I had to say the thought of using it the first time scares me at first because the notion of pulling hair in an amount in the same time would be quite painful. But I was wrong! This has been one hell of an experience! I could hardly feel any pain except for the tingly feel of ticklish while it does it job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more shaving for me! This epilator has got the best of me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be warn, if you would like to have a battery-runned epilator, this wouldn&#x27;t be your cup of tea, because we have to plug in the adaptor for usage.</li>
    <li> I have a low threshold for pain and was able to tolerate this OK from the very first time.  It gets easier the more you do it, though.  The issues I found with this product is that you may have to do this many times in the same area to completely remove hair and also the number of ingrown hairs that result after using it. Also, I was only able to use it on my legs as other areas prooved to be very painful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item three years ago and have had no problems with it.  I use it often, usually 5-10 minutes per day as quick hair removal, and have had no problems with it.  I was expecting it to break down once the warranty went out, which is common with small appliances, but it&#x27;s lasted.    I have noticed an increase in ingrown hairs, but it hasn&#x27;t been that severe and I love how smooth my legs stay after using this product.  Once you get used to the hairs being pulled out, it&#x27;s not that painful, even in the underarm and bikini areas.    *******    The above review is what I wrote back in 2007.    It&#x27;s now 2011 and I&#x27;m still using this same item. I agree with everything I said about it earlier, but now even more so.    I still use it regularly, except not so often. This isn&#x27;t due to the product breaking, it&#x27;s because my hair doesn&#x27;t grow as much as it used to. I can go at least a week now and not notice a huge difference in how hairly my legs are. I even recently went on vacation at a resort and hadn&#x27;t \\&quot;plucked\\&quot; in over a week and didn&#x27;t feel self-conscious about it at all.    If this one ever breaks, I&#x27;ll get another one just like it (if they still make it by then.....)</li>
    <li> I thought a review from a male user might prove useful, as if this thing can manage male leg hairs, it could probably handle anything. I tried it with some consternation regarding the pain levels, (having heard of earlier products that apparently felt like having hot pokers jabbed into your legs). Fears were unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about the relative comfort of the machine, but I found the experience relatively low in pain. I found that starting at the edge of the area to be removed helped a lot, and just gradually moving deeper and deeper into the area as the hair comes out. It worked for me rather well. Even areas that are quite sensitive were little problem once I worked this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were very good, actually. The was no hair left over, except bits about the knees, (but I got them as well once I worked out how). I found moving the thing too fast over the skin or pressing too hard reduced its effectiveness, as well. Something to watch for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, as a guy, I found this thing to be very good. I was very pleased and thought it was a fantastic alternative to getting into the razor every other day.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Remington for years and I switched to the Braun because I really like its kitchen appliances.  This epilator is great, and you won&#x27;t even feel the hairs being pulled with the gentle setting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Silk Epil 3 before, but needed a second one for travel.  i tried the less expensive version with 20 razors and no light.  It was very disappointing.  I love the Silk Epil 3 with 40 razors and a light.  The light is essential for seeing all those tiny hairs. Don&#x27;t waste your time with the less expensive model - do yourself a favor and go for the upgraded Braun SE3170.  You&#x27;re worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun SE3170 Silk-epil SoftPerfection Epilator and had it delivered within 4 days, even though at the time of purchase, I filled it out to be sent using just regular shipping.  It works great for me and I am really happy with it, since I have facial hair that must be taken care of about every other day.  This product is easy to operate and clean.  Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> This product is all they say that it is. It is not painful and you are &#x27;hair free&#x27; for weeks. I am so pleased with it I found it to be more than I expected. Nothing else has worked as well. buy it with confidence.</li>
    <li> Although it took a while to arrive, I love this epilator none the less. I love the different head pieces it comes with and the length of the electric cord is perfect. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recieved my epilator today and though I only used it on a small area of my leg I was pleasantly suprised at how gentle it was on the low setting although I am going to wait for the numbing spray to arrive before I go above the knee.  I am a chicken and do not like pain but I enjoy shaving even less so this would be a moderatly price epilator to start with and I have been told that the more you use it the pain lessens.  I do want to say though it does hurt and your experience will depend mostly on your pain tolerance if you can&#x27;t stand to tweeze your eyebrows this is proably not something you would want to purchase.  I would caution though do not use on dry skin which is what i did today.  Even though the pain was bearable I feel that if you exfoliate before using it will make the experience more tolerable. I have a cheap electric shaver and it actually hurst worse than this did simply because after the first time or two of using it dulling began and all it basically does now is pull the hair haphazardly out instead of shaving it off. This hurts Way less than waxing and there is no messy clean up afterward. The only fault as far as the design goes is that it is corded and is not water proof but if all goes well I intend to purchase one down the road that has these features.  Plus Braun has a 60 day money back guarantee which means if you purchase it (in theory which I have no reason to believe that this will not be the case) and you are not satisfied with the product you can return it. So there you have it in a nut shell.  Decent price, Great name, and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> It does a decent job and is not that painful to use but is not quite as good as the Epilady. Considering the difference in cost I am quite satisfied with the value of the product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> First off this review coming from a male  I don&#x27;t know where most female uses this but for me, i use this on my pubic area and my chest/stomach.    It does a great job on removing hair in the pubic area and stomach area mainly because its on a flat surface so not that bumpy but as for the chest area this area is a little more bumpy because we have muscles around this area so its a lot hard to remove the hair but it does a average job.   Now i did try this on my leg one time to see how well it works and i can say this does a very poor job on the leg area.   As for armpit, i dont know because i never tried on armpit because i dont mind having hair there    The only cons i can say about this product is, its very loud. Most girls probably dont mind about shaving or letting other know your shaving but as a male i find it uncomfortable to let others know i shave even though my roommate probably knows what im doing already and just isnt saying anything for my sake.   The other thing is this epilator pretty time consuming, i think i spend around half n hour doing my chest and pubic area because i know my shower takes 15min - 30min and i normally come out of the bathroom 1 hour later.    As for the pain  THIS WILL HURT FOR THE FIRST TIME   but as you get use to it, you dont really feel it anymore and it just becomes more of a tiny pinch    been using for about 3 years already, still hasnt broke down</li>
    <li> I love this product because it gives you a clean underarm or nice legs, but it can be painful if you use it on your underarms. I bought this pink one because it was supposed to be a started epilator instead of going straight to the hi-tech 40 tweezers for each swipe. It is painful in the beginning but you will get used to the feeling. Sometimes I feel like the underarm stings because there is a small cut from a mistake. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me being no careful but you should buy this product!</li>
    <li> I just got mine and love it so far...I immediatly did my stubble covered legs with no prep work...even the tops of my feet and toes.  The sensation of hair being pulled out feels like something sticky being peeled off your legs. It does hurt at ankles and knees but so does everything else.  Great little gadget.</li>
    <li> Removes the hair efficiently so it&#x27;s quicker than waxing and not as messy!</li>
    <li> I really like this epilator.  It did hurt more than I expected the first time I used it, but I was very impressed with the results.  Very smooth legs, much smoother than with a razor.  I will definitely continue to use this product</li>
    <li> very useful one . i liked it very much. the hair growth visibly decreased and also the quality of hair improved in comparision to the hair u get if u shave or use hair removing cream.    its a little painful but for sure worth a try and then u will like it use it regularly.</li>
    <li> this is a good product.  i have fine hair and i wish that this pulled the hair out stronger.  i use it without the attachments for faster hair removal.</li>
    <li> This epilator works like a champ, no problems with order, delivery or function.  Only wish it did not hurt!</li>
    <li> I used the ordinary waxing all my life, and this is my first experience with the epilator, a real good experience.   The epilator is fast, not painful if you get used to it and know how to use it, very easy to shave all your body, little bit hard in soft areas, but in general Excellent.   The main problems are: You may discover that you didnt remove all hair and there are v small few once scattered if you don&#x27;t clean your body well while you are using it to see which areas are clean and which are not.   And, using it for the bikini area is very painful .. at least for me..   But in large, Excellent innovation, i just loved it!</li>
    <li> Since I am expecting my first baby in June, I wanted a product that would cut down my time in the shower. The Braun Silk-epil allows me to shave anywhere at anytime. And because it removes hair from the root, I&#x27;ve been able to go hair-free for days. With a razor, shaving every day was a must. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to save time and enjoy smooth, soft skin with painless effort.</li>
    <li> I have found this gadget to remove hair fast with little irritation.  The product is not pain free but if you can endure the discomfort its a great way to reduce hair growth.</li>
    <li> (3/04) Now, I am not some weirdo who lives for pain or anything, but I admit, I find myself looking for places other than my legs to use this thing.  Legs, armpits, bikini line, big toes... It&#x27;s just so satisfying to use, knowing that the two hours you may have to put into the process (as one reviewer claimed) is worth it for not having to worry about nicks and cuts at ALL or stubble for at least another two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things from my own experience for those of you considering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this intending to use it on my legs and bikini line only.  I was thrilled that it is AC powered, because I feared batteries would become a real budget-killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, I did use the attachment thing with the rolling beads the first time I used it. I also used the slowest speed.  Decided it wasn&#x27;t so bad, so I sped it up, then removed the attachment. No problem.  I may have even thrown the attachment away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, you should exfoliate your skin before use.  The directions tell you it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to take a hot shower and exfoliate, then when dry, use the gizmo.  Your pores are open, your skin fresh, and the little hairs should be more willing to let go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, it DOES hurt to use on your underarm.  Doing so took a bit of acrobatics, because I found I had to try to pull my skin taught while using it.  I also found I got a few ingrown hairs there from use.  Decided that using a razor on this area isn&#x27;t that bad after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO, it is NOT impossible to use on your bikini area.  Just be prepared to sit in some funny, yoga-like positions to get to the areas you want.  Also, make sure you keep up on exfoliating here: I find I have the worst problems with ingrowns in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, you can get stubble.  If this becomes a problem, wait a few days for the stubble to grow long enough to grab.  Before you use it again, shower, exfoliate, dry and try again.  I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll end up with less stubble that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, it CAN take a while.  I even found that if I don&#x27;t soak and scrub before using, I&#x27;ll miss a few hairs and have to go over an area again days later.  No big deal if you have the time to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pain level:  If you have a tattoo, then why are you even bothering worrying about pain?  You should be able to handle this baby toy.  If you, like the average person, can handle things like paper cuts, needles, and insect stings, you can probably handle the pain level of this thing.  Or, if you&#x27;ve had professional waxings done before, you probably won&#x27;t have a problem.  If you can&#x27;t stand pulling an adhesive bandage off of an area with hair on it, then perhaps this isn&#x27;t the choice for you.  Note:  I&#x27;ve never had a professional waxing done, just those messy at-home kits.  To me, the kits hurt more than this thing!  Probably my fault, though -- can&#x27;t ever get the mix at the right temp or work quickly enough before the stuff cools again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooo... if you&#x27;re fed up with the blade and want an alternative to wax, smelly hair dissolvers, or sanding disks, try this.  I felt it was definitely worth the money! (Bought &amp; have used since September, 2003)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(UPDATE 10/04)  STILL use and love this thing!  I&#x27;m even considering buying another to have on hand for when the inevitable happens and the first one dies on me.  Couldn&#x27;t even guess how much I&#x27;ve saved on replacement blades &amp; shave gels... this thing has definitely paid for itself many times over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(UPDATE 11/07) Mine (the original one) is still running great, and I still love it. Bought one for my sister, but she doesn&#x27;t like it because she&#x27;s apparently more of a wimp than I thought, even though she&#x27;s got 2 tattoos! I may just steal hers back to keep in reserve for when mine DOES decide to die on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(UPDATE 6/10) Original Silk-epil still running perfectly. It sure did come in handy while pregnant last year! Still love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(UPDATE 5/12) STILL use my original Silk-epil. STILL runs perfectly! To add to the record, I now have three tattoos (ring finger, shoulder and foot - OUCHIE!!!) and I can honestly say using this device does NOT, in ANY way, hurt even a FIFTH as much as getting a tattoo does!&lt;br /&gt;(I realize that this review is for a very old version, but I believe they couldn&#x27;t have changed and evolved this technology very much to make this review invalid.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now. I purchased it because I have light skin but dark, coarse, quick growing hair so my legs look and feel stubbly 12 hours after I shave them. I tried creams but they were a mess and home waxing took forever and forced me to wait a long time between sessions so that all the hairs were long enough to pull out. &lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use like an electric razor,and works on much shorter hair than home waxing so no monster legs. I had been shaving before the first use, so had dense hair growth and the first couple uses hurt a bit. After that its not painful because hair growth is thinner for each use.  I&#x27;d recommend waxing once before the first use if you&#x27;re worried about it hurting. &lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get legs perfectly hair free like shaving, very short or very fine hair is left behind, I had this with waxing as well so was not disappointed. My legs in a week still look and feel better than they used to a day after shaving. If its important to me, I run a razor over what&#x27;s left and then have super smooth legs for days. I&#x27;ve only felt the need to do this twice for special occasions. Usually I use it every two weeks, but sometimes once a week if I want smoother legs. I often let it go for 2 weeks because the hair is so fine and soft that I don&#x27;t have scratchy legs to bug me or my husband. ;) Would have given 5 stars if legs were perfectly hairless after use, or if I could go a month between uses. &lt;br /&gt;If this broke or was lost, I&#x27;d purchase another one immediatly.</li>
    <li> So I suppose I should preface this by saying that I have very dark, coarse hair and very (very!) pale skin.  This product, though painful, is the single most amazing beauty product I have ever bought.    I must admit that the pain was shocking at first, but so long as I have a hot shower, dry off well, and coat the area in talcum powder (to dry the skin completely and to lift the hairs) it isn&#x27;t too bad... it&#x27;s not pleasant by any means, but it&#x27;s bearable.  The result is... amazing.  Wax has been messy and expensive and, at times, ineffective on my stubborn roots.  Shaving is not an option for me; my legs look hairy even after shaving because the dark root shows through my pale skin.  This product was fast (about 20 mins per full leg), effective, and just... amazing.  I am beyond happy.  BUT do not buy this product if you have a low threshold for pain.  It&#x27;s not pleasant.  But, in my opinion, it&#x27;s no worse than waxing.</li>
    <li> pros: works great and really does keep your legs hair free for a lot longer than shaving and waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:  extreamly painful to use (this product does not shave your legs it plucks the hair form your legs). The first time I used this product it kept my legs hair free for 3 weeks but was so painful to use I did not every want to try it on my under arms. A little bit of a hassle to clean also.</li>
    <li> This thing really hurts but once I make it through the pain I am able to stand it! I bought this a few years ago, tried it, and put it RIGHT BACK in the box because the pain was too much. I just reopened it and did both my legs AND my under arms. There is a slow and fast setting. The slow setting doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad. The fast setting hurts but gets the job done more effectively (you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot).The hair on my leg was GONE for about 2 weeks. Like, i was as bare as a baby&#x27;s behind! Now that it&#x27;s growing back it&#x27;s so fine as if i have never shaved before. Very good! But i used this device under my chin (since it can catch even the thinnest of hairs) and i feel like that hair grew back thicker! :( Anyway, I would recommend this product only for people who aren&#x27;t wimps- or should i say- have a high pain tolerance! :)</li>
    <li> This product works very well for removing hair everywhere I have tried, but it does take some getting used. The pain I experienced when I first started using this was bad enough that I did not want to try again. A few weeks later I did, and it was not nearly as painful. I do not think my hair is growing back slower-but it is growing back thinner and some follicles are not growing back at all.   It is also not a quick process. The first time I used it-it took about an hour to do my legs, arms, and bikini area. On my second try, it took about half as much time. It can be difficult to get some of the smaller hairs-but I take off the safe guard/massage guard and am able to get a few more.   My best advice is to tough out the pain and do a little bit at a time.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator and I love this one much more than my last one (Panasonic with spinning heads) which lasted me 3 - 4 years.  This one gets the hair out without having to go over the same spot over an over.  The light, which I thought was a silly option, is actually very helpful.  I just got it yesterday and I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and my underarms.  Yes, it hurt doing my underarms but only a little but I have a fairly high tolerance for pain.  I barely feel it when using it on my legs but that might be because I&#x27;ve used one before and I&#x27;m used to it.  Some down sides are that it doesn&#x27;t come with other/smaller heads for trimming or doing your bikini area and it is kinda loud.  It scared the heck out of my dogs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I use this mainly on my upper arms and feet, cause I&#x27;m a hobbit. You must raze the hairs to a short length before using it! I have semi-course hair, and yes, this hurts, but it works. But pain threshold is subjective, so it might hurt less on you, maybe more. Take a tweezer and pull a hair, then imagine the same for all your hairs in an area, all at once. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s going to feel like. No, it&#x27;s not going to feel better than that, it&#x27;s really going to feel like all your hairs are being pulled out. Yes, it&#x27;s going to hurt. I would recommend getting moderately intoxicated beforehand - that really helps!     The first time I used this, it pulled all the hairs from the root. The second time, it broke a lot of hairs and caused stubble. The third time, it didn&#x27;t break any hairs and pulled them all from the root. So there must be a sweet spot somewhere.     Yes, exfolioating as the hairs grow is good. I use St. Ives Apricot Scrub and that seems to do the trick. But you&#x27;ll still get stubble as the hairs are growing in. But it&#x27;s completely different than if you shaved. And yes, the hairs are fewer and less course.    But everyone&#x27;s body is different. I can only say that this works for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying it on your nipples or other sensitive parts, but maybe I&#x27;m chicken.</li>
    <li> I have used Egyptian \\&quot;halwa,\\&quot; hot and cold wax and \\&quot;threading\\&quot; for depilation or removing hair by the roots.  This is because of Middle Eastern common belief that women should always remove hair and only men should shave.  Never shave, say women in Middle Eastern beauty saloons because it causes the hair to grow back more thickly.  Additionally, hair removed from the root gives most almost one month of smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that all other options are expensive (if done as a service in saloons) and time consuming.  I often do halwa myself, but I must set aside as much as an hour for a self-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this small, relatively inexpensive device because it removes the hair instead of cutting it off and because I can completely finish my legs in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all forms of removing hair by the root -- halwa, threading, waxing, etc., require some pain tolerance, and I handle them all quite well, this device made me conscious of the discomfort.  I hadn&#x27;t expected to feel it.  I expected that waxing, halwa and threading would be more painful, but in fact, they are about equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing is to go slowly over the surface.  This helps to ensure the device is getting all the hair and provides for more complete pulling.  If you can avoid breakage of the hair, you&#x27;ll be hairfree for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It is noisy but it does get the job done. The two types of head allows for easy adjustment to epilating!</li>
    <li> This is NOT an expensive epilator, yet I&#x27;m simply delighted with it!    For dark-haired women like myself this thing is like a dream come true.      I use it on my legs only (at this point), and keep waiting for that ugly dark stubble to show up, esp on my lower legs, and it does NOT!    This hurt a lot more the first time than any subsequent uses.  If you can stand that first use, when you&#x27;re plucking virtually every hair, the 2nd, 3rd, etc use will be much, much easier.    I started with my lower legs, and every week went up a bit further.  Now there&#x27;s almost no pain and frankly my legs look better than they ever have in my life!    My only regret is that this product did not exist 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an epilator, and I was really pleased with the product!  Easy to use and great results.  I actually look forward to using it!</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at an epilator. It&#x27;s easy to use, but a bit scary initially. I think I&#x27;d go for one with more tweezers in the heads next time.</li>
    <li> Ever since I bought this product and started using it I get so many compliments on how smooth my legs look and feel.  Any guy lucky enough to get a feel of my legs just can&#x27;t stop commenting on how smooth they feel.  And it&#x27;s nice because it lasts.  This is not like the epilators of yesteryear.  It&#x27;s fast, efficient and doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as those old ones.  In fact, I kind of like the way it feels.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong when I say that.  You can definitely feel the hairs being yanked out by their roots.  But it&#x27;s so quick that it&#x27;s really just like a sting more than anything.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 years now. It still works marvelously.</li>
    <li> this is my first time using an epilator and i never waxed in my life but had used the cream for painless hair removal. suprisingly, i felt no pain at all while using the epilator, maybe its because i have relatively little leg hair but i had to roll over certain spots so many times since it doesn&#x27;t get everything and it doesn&#x27;t get everything by the roots. some of the hair get chipped off; so i guess its an ok product but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female with hirituism (due to PCOS) and I have had a problem with male-like beard growth since I was 13 years old. Ever since that age I have been shaving the hair on my chin and cheeks, and the hair just got fuller and more coarse over the years. On top of that, I have developed razor bumps and hyperpigmentation from shaving so often (every other day). My chin area just looks disgusting and has often prevented me from feeling feminine/attractive or getting close to others for fear of them seeing it.    I recieved my Braun 3170 today along with another product that I had ordered, called Bump Stopper 2 (to treat my razor bumps). I have never waxed or tweezed, so I was a little scared of what the pain of epilating might be like. I started with Speed 1 on my cheeks. It did hurt, but I could deal with it. It took me about 20 minutes to do the right side of my face.     Once I started getting used to the pain, I moved on to my chin area, which has a LOT of hair, very similar to a man&#x27;s beard but a tad more sparse. It hurt like hell and I actually turned the epilator off for a minute so that I could compose myself. But I knew it was going to hurt because of the large amount of hair that was there, so I sucked it up and started again, staying motivated by reminding myself of how much better my face will look with all of this hair gone.    After another 20 minutes or so of doing my chin, I got tired of it taking so long, so I turned it up to Speed 2. The faster speed actually hurt less and the process started going much faster. And since I wasnt in as much pain anymore, I switched to the Efficiency Pro Clip Adapter and that got the hairs out even faster. I was delighted to watch the hairs fall into the sink! Thats what kept me going despite the pain that I was still feeling.     The pain also lessened as more hair was removed, since less hairs were being ripped out at a time...so the less hair you have, the less it hurts.    It took me another 30 minutes or so to finish my face completely. I washed my face off with antibacterial soap, dried it off, and applied the Bump Stopper 2. My face is now smooth(despite a few swollen places) and hair free. The swelling is minimal and is going away quickly. I am so glad I got the Braun 3170 epilator. My only regret is that I didnt start epilating sooner.    If you want the hair gone badly enough, you can and WILL endure the pain to get the great results!</li>
    <li> I got this product after my best friend raved about her epilator.  This is the first epilator I have tried -- and previously shaved my legs and waxed my arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little intimidating to use at first, but once you&#x27;re used to it -- it&#x27;s no big deal.  I found the roller-head attachment unnecessary and use it without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my epilator for about two years now -- coupled with a hair inhibiting moisturizer (I use \\&quot;Get Out of Hair\\&quot; by Bliss) -- and my leg and underarm hair have proceeded to get thinner and scantier since I first started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my epilator!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used the epilator I did feel the pain, but it isn&#x27;t unbearable or anything. The advantage was that I didn&#x27;t feel any hair for over two weeks afterwards. The only other downside is I really have to plan for ingrown hairs. The product manual says to watch out for this and talks about ways to prevent them. I just use a exfoliating scrub in the shower now and moisturize as usual (I moisturize a lot anyway). It&#x27;s really a great product! Try it if you can.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, does the job very well. It is a very fast way to get your legs smooth and nice. Best if used just after a shower as the pain will be reduced a bit.</li>
    <li> First of all, the shipping was amazingly fast. I got it three days after I placed the order.    And the product. I was pleasantly surprised when I used it. IT DIDN&#x27;T HURT! I&#x27;ve used two other epilators before: One worked well but hurt like a bi*ch and the other one did not hurt but merely pulled at my hair and didn&#x27;t do anything else. BUT this one works AND doesn&#x27;t hurt!   I am extremely satisfied. :)</li>
    <li> I recommend any body to use it is so easy to use and it remove the hair with less pain than the other machines.</li>
    <li> This model is much less effective than my old Silk Epil that I used happily for eight years.  I don&#x27;t know why, but it doesn&#x27;t get the hairs out.  You have to go over the same area forever.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have tried for hair removal in a long time.  I had purchased an Epilady and used it till its recent demise and never thought anything could replace it.  Although it was VERY painful to use, the hair grew back very fine and scarce, the longer you used it, improving the hair texture over time.  I then used shavers, cremes, lotions, epil-stop and all were worthless products.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have the Braun, I am ecstatic with the results, it is much quicker and virtually painless compared to the original Epilady.  I highly recommend to women who do not want to become a slave to daily razor shaving!</li>
    <li> I got this thing in the mail yesterday, and I&#x27;m delighted! It works WONDERFULLY. It does take a few passes to really clear an area.. but given some patience it&#x27;s magic. &lt;br /&gt;The pain is the biggest concern of a lot of folks with these things. As I and some friends discovered, this is one of Life&#x27;s Unfair Moments -- the worse you feel you need an epilator, the harder it will be to use. &lt;br /&gt;Deep heavy hair hurts like heck coming out.. soft peach fuzz you can hardly feel leaving -- it&#x27;s just a little prickly sensation. I&#x27;d suggest testing the area you want to clear with some tweezers first. If you can clear say a square inch of it without hurting too bad, the epilator should work just fine for you. &lt;br /&gt;If the tweezers hurt too much, I&#x27;d suggest passing up epilators. However, if you&#x27;re desperate there are some topical anesthetics on the market you might consider. The prescription brand is EMLA.. there&#x27;s also an OTC version, &amp;quot;elemax&amp;quot; I think. I&#x27;ve never had occasion to try either with an epilator, but I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work. &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it does, but it hurts, and unlike waxing, the pain is long and drawn out as you rub this thing over your skin.  I had a LOT of really thick hair that I wanted to get rid of, I&#x27;m talking about the kind that bleeds when you pull it out, and this thing DOES gets rid of it.  The first time I tried it though, the pain was unbearable.  I suggest waxing, then letting a few of the hairs grow back in and using this device to keep the hair at bay.  Waxing was better to get rid of the hair the first time, but this is infinitely better for keeping it gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with Braun&#x27;s SoftPerfection Epilator (which is my first one ever). After reading other reviews on this product, I find that it does help to use it right after showering and drying off when the pores are more open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on more that just my bikini line (if you know what I mean). I found that it stung pretty bad (I&#x27;ve used Nads before there and it was just as painful). What I ended up doing is working on a bit each day, stopping when the pain was too intense. But after the initial all over removal, the hair is growing back at different rates, so maintenance (and more importantly pain!) is pretty minimal if I use it after each shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very please with this product and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending it to others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************************************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/8/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this 2-3 times every week and it has held up quite well! As long as you use it at least every other day, there isn&#x27;t any pain. I also removed the detachable coil plate that&#x27;s there to prevent the tweezers from getting too close to your skin. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it being gone.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver more than anyone i bought. I had the panasonic one but that one is cordless and drove me nuts when it ra out of power. I like the corded feature on this one and it gave me less ingrown hairs ( not perfect but less)</li>
    <li> After my last epil-lady died in Europe, as soon as I came back to the states I knew I had to order another.&lt;br /&gt;They are efficient, less painful than waxing, and have longer results.&lt;br /&gt;When the Braun SE3170 came in the mail I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. Not only did I receive the product much quicker than Amazon anticipated, but it&#x27;s nifty light on the power switch was a good surprise as well.</li>
    <li> the only reason i don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because of the PAIN. epilating is pain, i don&#x27;t care what brand you use. if you keep up with it and use it often, it is a little less painful, but it still hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t use the shaver part, it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love to use this for my armpits, it leaves them smooth and hair free for a few days or more. i find it hurts less if i take off the spike wheel attachement, but that&#x27;s just me. it&#x27;s small and easy to take with you.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I had been using another company&#x27;s \\&quot;Epilady\\&quot; for last 15+ years and this was definitely a fantastic change.  It takes 1/2 the time to do a more thorough removal.  Best value, best option!!!</li>
    <li> After all the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I decided to go for the Braun epilator. I&#x27;ve never had an epilator therefore all the idea i had was from the reviews. I got this today and was excited to try it out but the moment i turned it on, I was kind of intimidated by the loud noise, it was scary to me.. After an hour, I got over it and tried it on my legs. It wasn&#x27;t that bad, I think the pain factor was exagerrated in the reviews.. So I decided to try it on my underarms (which a lot of people claim is more painful than the legs), it was not bad at all.. Pain was minimal to me...     This is not a miracle machine though, hair doesn&#x27;t diasappear just like that, you have to go over the same area a couple of times and might have to try different strokes to get rid of unwanted hair... But overall, I still like it though coz it sure beats the time i would have spent on waxing or tweezing!     The shape and the weight of the product is perfect especially for the knee area, which is slightly curved...       I used to wax my underarms and legs so i guess the roots are weaker... I&#x27;m thinking that might be it.. plus my high tolerance for pain...</li>
    <li> Easy to use, not the most painful epilator I&#x27;ve ever used. I like that it has two different speeds. Overall a good hair removal system.</li>
    <li> This is the first time after years that I have purchased an epilator again, and I was expecting the same painful loud machines that I used to use in the 90s. I must say I am very positively surprised, it was almost pain free (I must add I am not very sensitive and used to the old torturing machienes)  but if you can deal with the pain of waxing you can for sure deal with this.     It&#x27;s very light, does not heat up too fast and is not annoyingly loud. The massage head is a nice add but I prefer the normal head because it does not miss so many hairs. If you like the epilator hair removal technique this is a great product for a great price. I had to spend about 30-40 minutes because it does miss some very fine short hairs, but I think that&#x27;s the case with all of these products, and I prefer spending a little bit more time but know that I will be hair free for at least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am really glad I got this item. It does hurt the first time. (In fact, the friends who I let try it couldn&#x27;t finish epilating their legs.) I recommend drinking a bottle of wine first and having your partner epilate you while you close your eyes and grit your teeth. But after the first time, it&#x27;s not a problem. The hairs grow at different speeds so you might want to do touch ups about every week or so (if you&#x27;re going to the beach), but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it&#x27;s quick. No regrets; a great value.</li>
    <li> Perfect,     I had my other Braun for last 7 years, but I lost it in one of my trip,   So I baught the new one, because I trust only Braun Silk epil     Love it!!!     You don&#x27;t need a lot of the fancy stuff from very pricy one. All you need is classic. This is what you get for great price</li>
    <li> is so nice!! I&#x27;m happy to have this; I used the old model (15 year ago) and Im amazed with the improvements. this is a cheap and great product, a very low pain, very effect product</li>
    <li> After having my hysterectomy I sprouted hair in places even men don&#x27;t have hair.  I LOVE this device for its results on face, neck, etc.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t try it sooner.</li>
    <li> There are more comfortable units like emjoi. This one is made to last, in it&#x27;s favor. It grabs skin if it&#x27;s not really taut.</li>
    <li> I use this every week, my skin is softer and it help me to maintain my legs hair from coming out. The only thing is that you have to exfoliate your skin at least once a week because it can get dry from the use of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my legs, under arm and bikini line, and it works perfectly for this areas. Totally recomended.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I could buy this item. It was not expensive, and the product is so easy to handle. I can use it anywhere, so I can travel with it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried waxing or tweezing, and this is my first epilator. I bought this after extensive research and comparison of all the epilators out there. I chose this one because of the price and all the great reviews. This epilator is great; I was very apprehensive of the pain, but I barely felt it on my arms and legs (I tired using the massaging attachment but it was annoying so I ended up using it with neither of the attachments). It was painful on the armpits but it was bearable and I ended up getting used to it. The bikini line was a whole different story, I found it totally unbearable and gave up. I&#x27;m trying to build up the courage to try again. Anyways, the places that I did use it, the hair didn&#x27;t come back for over two weeks, which is great. And when it did come back, it was very light and I could barely see it. Most reviews mentioned was the problem with ingrown hairs, I haven&#x27;t gotten any so that isn&#x27;t a problem for me. It&#x27;s recommended that you take a hot shower before using the epilator, but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference for me. I generally shower after I use it; I feel cleaner that way.    Overall, this product is great and I would totally recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try an epilator for awhile now and finally bought one after my waxing place stopped giving a 20% discount on return visits. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all on the legs (maybe it would if you have never waxed before), but it also doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as well as I would want. I did try it briefly on the bikini area which hurt A LOT.</li>
    <li> probably better to get the more recent version. this one works but could work better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and especially the price. I couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore, and your a blessing in disguise for still selling it. I think its the best made, easy to use model. And the package was here in just a few days. I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product 2 times and it does a great job but it is a bit painful!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried an epilator before, but I wanted a hair removal method that wouldn&#x27;t compromise the tan that I spent so much time and money developing.  This product had great reviews, so I tried it.  And it was great!  It is simple to use, and not very painful.  My underarms and legs stay smooth for many days, and I even use it on my bikini area.  (But beware, the bikini area hurts very much!!!)  The results are totally smooth, and my tan legs remain tan after epilating.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Hello,    I have been using this product for over a year and love it!  It&#x27;s not perfect, but I am very happy with the results.  After reading a few of the other reviews, I&#x27;d like to share some things I learned along the way (and wish someone had told me about when I just started using this product).    - When you just start using this product you will have stubble for the first 1-3 months.  This is because hair grows in cycles you need to wait for all the hairs you ever shaved to get long enough for the epilator to pull out.  But stick with it and eventually you will have lovely smooth skin.    - Hair growth becomes very sparse/thinner with time.  This means it is not as painful to remove the hair and you won&#x27;t need to use the product as often.     - Ingrown Hairs - I&#x27;ve read that some people experience ingrown hair with this product even though they exfoliate.  I too experienced this in the beginning, but after some research and trial and error, I discovered that moisturizing is the key to preventing this!  Applying regular lotion is NOT sufficient at keeping your skin and hair soft enough to prevent ingrown hairs.  I recommend heavy duty moisturizing with petroleum jelly, baby oil, coco butter, or something similar.  I usually apply a heavy duty moisturizer to myself (everywhere I use the epilator) at bedtime a few times a week. You should apply just enough for it to be effective, no need to turn yourself into a greasy mess.  For areas that are particularly susceptible to ingrown hairs (i.e. bikini area) I also apply a heavy moisturizer after every shower (right after I apply a salicylic acid product like Clinique Clarifying Lotion solution - link below) .  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with ingrown hairs since I started doing this and my skin is super soft!  And when I did get an ingrown hair (very very rare), it was very easy to remove and there was only minimal bruising which healed in about a day or two.    - Using this in the underarm area is still very painful, but there are ways of reducing the discomfort.  Initially, I recommend following the advice of other reviewers who suggested shaving your armpits and then epilating everyday for the first 2 weeks.  You&#x27;ll need to do some creative yoga-like poses in order to pull the skin tight, but this extra effort will reduce discomfort.  This will also prevent the skin from getting caught in the tweezer things.  I usually do two runs when with the epilator when I&#x27;m removing underarm hair...the first with the roller attachment and the second without.  After the first two weeks, keep an eye on the underarm hair and epilate as soon as you notice any growth. This maintenance is quick, results in minimal to no pain, and the results are great.      - I also recommend the above approach for your bikini area.  Except I always use the roller attachment, otherwise my skin gets caught in the tweezers and that hurts/bruises.  Be prepared to get into some strange positions in order to reach everywhere you want to get to.  Similar to the underarm area, epilate as soon as you notice hair growth to reduce discomfort.    - Apply a salicylic acid product like Clinique Clarifying Lotion solution to effected areas after you epilate. This stimulates cell turnover and prevents blocked pores which helps reduce ingrown hairs.   http://www.amazon.com/Clinique-Clarifying-Lotion-3-6oz/dp/B000R8KEIS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1273444100&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3    - Be patient and stick with it.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have used this epilator for about a year and find it quite useful for on my legs and underarm. It is sturdy; the performance has not changed after regular use for one year. Braun is a trustworthy brand.    Pros:  - Does a decent job removing hair. It pulls rather fast to help to reduce pain, but often it breaks hair from just above the skin instead of uprooting it. This could be just me - my hair tends to be thicker, and I rarely exfoliate. Personally this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and I am happy with how my skin feels after using the epilator. Overtime, I do notice a significant reduction in number and thickness of hair after switching from shaving. It also gets much easier and painless to epilate as the hair gets thinner.    - Looks nice and feels comfortable in hand when using it. It does produce some noise but not loud.    - Easy to clean with the supplied brush. In addition, I often detach the rolling tweezer part from the electrical body in order to rinse the tweezers thoroughly and then air dry. So far there is not a bit of rust on any of the metal components at all. With proper care, it still looks and works like a brand new one. Very good build quality.    - No batteries required and comes with a built-in voltage converter so that you can epilate anywhere in the world as long as there is an electric outlet!      Cons:  - I find the two massage rollers scratching and irritating my skin. Hence I only use the other plastic cover that exposes half of the tweezer part.    - It&#x27;s great for legs. For underarms, be prepared for some small skin damage in your first several trials. It can take a while to figure out how much pressure to apply to the armpit contours. Right amount of pressure + right angle &#x3D; maximal contact between the tweezers and your hair without pulling the skin. Frankly, this epilator isn&#x27;t great for contours and small areas. It doesn&#x27;t work well in the bikini area. I also don&#x27;t recommend using it on the face.    - Doesn&#x27;t work well if your skinand hair are not dry, at least not for me.    - No carrying pouch/case included for organization and travel.      For prospective buyers who have only shaved and never used waxing or epilating, chances are you&#x27;ll find it quite painful if you start epilating right away. There are several options to ease into less painful epilating, such as go waxing by a professional, slower manual removal of hair with a tweezer, or applying topical anesthesia to mildly numb the skin prior to eplicating. After a hair has been completely pulled out by its root once or twice, it becomes thinner and much less painful to remove again. Thus you can sufficiently prepare yourself to overcome the initial hurdle/pain and enjoy routine epilating soon afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have an 15 year old Braurn Epilator, that works better than this new one and less painfull and this new Eplitar tend to scratch your skin as well.</li>
    <li> Alright, so I figured I&#x27;d write a review for this product, even though I don&#x27;t normally. Firstly, i think it&#x27;s relevant that I have very coarse hair where i&#x27;ve been shaving for years, and very light skin. it sucks because my skin is also somewhat translucent, therefore i tend to be able to see the black hairs before they&#x27;ve even grown back. even after shaving, although my legs would feel smooth, i could still see the shadow of hair. i was terrified after reading some of these reviews that the thing was going to hurt a lot. it didn&#x27;t. it only hurt a little, and that was the first time I did each body part, because the hair was there in full force, though not very long. legs weren&#x27;t bad even so. underarms- yeah. that stung quite a bit. i just got done doing my bikini line and that was just plain horrible, although the hair was much longer than suggested so i&#x27;m assuming that added to the pain factor. i have a very high pain threshold, to give you an idea. the product doesn&#x27;t get every hair, something that i wasn&#x27;t too pleased with- in fact, it seems to work much better on coarser hairs. i had problems with getting most of the hair on the back of my thighs where its pretty light. did a pretty good job with visible hairs, but my legs don&#x27;t feel smooth. they look it, just don&#x27;t feel it. i was overjoyed with the job that it did with my underarms (after the redness faded in about a day) until right around now, when im getting all these ingrown hairs. i&#x27;ve been exfoliating, but it hasn&#x27;t seemed to work there. I guess i&#x27;ll have to use tend skin more often in that spot. i do like this product cuz it keeps the hair away for a while (like a week it seems with me) but i have to do constant touch ups. that and i cant see it through my skin. oh and it also eliminated the problem of razor bumps that i had pretty bad after shaving everytime. ok done rambling, hope this has helped</li>
    <li> when we use it for the first time it feels great even though it misses out a few hairs in between, but then when the hair starts growing back, it looks awful coz of all the ingrown hair. Have been using ConAir Trimmer, that gives me better results than this. I seriously do not recommend this product. I do not have the receipt for this, else by now I would have returned it. A serious waste of $40.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ll admit it took a few uses to really get the hang of it, as I had never used an epilator before. But now I can&#x27;t imagine living without it.    It gets the job done way better than shaving, and leaves my skin looking &amp; feeling good.    It has a \\&quot;I&#x27;ll be working for a long time\\&quot; sturdy feel, and the instructions for both use &amp; maintenance are simple &amp; non-intimidating.</li>
    <li> This product was not gentle on my legs. It hurt, even with the massaging attachment. Plus, it did not get all of the hairs on the first pass, and seemed to cause me to get more ingrown hairs. I gave it three stars because when it finally gets the hairs, they do not come back for a while. If you are sensitive to pain, though, this is not the epilator for you.</li>
    <li> The original Epilady sold me on epilators over shaving, and I&#x27;ve been epilating ever since.  This unit is by far the best epilator I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s fast, but somehow is relatively painless.  Much faster and more thorough than my old Emjoi epilator.  Because it&#x27;s not cordless, it&#x27;s very light, which I like.  The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little noisy.</li>
    <li> I may have read this in another review, but this item just broke off my hair and did not pull it out.  I have fine blond hair, so maybe that is why it did not work.  I think the makers could make recommendations regarding the kinds of hair it works on best.</li>
    <li> BUY ONE OF THESE!!! THE BEST $40 I HAVE SPENT IN YEARS!!!  I have owned 2 other epilators in the past incl the old epilady int he early 1990&#x27;s. This epilator is amazing! I have large areas of my legs where no hair grows from the old style epilady I owed. It took me hours back then and it was painful. This new Braun is so good the pain is only slight, and diminishes in just a few minutes after starting to use it. I even used it on my bikini line and was very impressed that there was no pain AND it worked on short stubble.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did without this little baby.  You&#x27;re always hesitant about an epilator, but I didn&#x27;t find this one to be a problem at all.  It&#x27;s quick and relatively painless even on the first try.  After subsequent shaves it gets much easier.  Easy to clean and the two speeds let you decide what level you need/want to shave (I believe that&#x27;s based on your pain tolerance and what stage your hair growth is in).  It&#x27;s a great answer if you have ingrown hairs or shaving stubble on your legs - with the shaver I found those issues have become less of a problem.</li>
    <li> I chose this product for my first epilator because of its decent price and customer reviews. I found it pleasantly easy to use, which is saying a lot because I&#x27;m usually not very good with techie things.     I thought it would take all the hair off in one go, but you kind of have to keep going over and over the same strip of skin until it&#x27;s bare. I don&#x27;t know if any epilator can do this.     Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good beginner&#x27;s product. It&#x27;s quick, easy, and relatively painless (especially compared to Nair).     My only complaint is that there is no really good way to clean it out. I just blow on it, then brush it off with the mini brush (included), but I feel like that doesn&#x27;t clean it all the way.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m not very impressed with it. It works okay but some of the hairs seem to break off instead of being plucked out.  The attachments are good for getting used to the feeling by only allowing a few hairs to be plucked at a time. Also they&#x27;re good if your scared to touch this loud machine to your skin. It does sound a little scary but it doesn&#x27;t hurt very much, just don&#x27;t let the hair grow too long.    I&#x27;ve owned this epilator for about a month and I still use it but plan on buying a better one.</li>
    <li> great, came right away and it works great.................i had an older model, this one is great</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator because I&#x27;m tired of shaving my legs and waxing is too much money. I can only recommend this Braun epilator. It doesn&#x27;t even hurt a lot, just a little uncomfortable. So get it!! It&#x27;s easy to handle, easy to clean and a good price. Don&#x27;t try to use it for your arm pits though...it hurts like CRAZY!!! For your legs, tip top!!</li>
    <li> I hesitated for months before buying this product because I was afraid of the pain.  However, I became frustrated with the expense and inconvenience of waxing, so I finally took the plunge.  I am so glad I did!      I use this epilator every day or so, usually right after I shower. This approach gets rid of the hair as it grows in, so there&#x27;s never too much--which is great for keep my appearance high and the discomfort level low.  I&#x27;ve used it on my legs, bikini line, underarms--and my face!--with great results.      I haven&#x27;t been to the salon for waxing since I bought this great little gadget--a savings of close to $300, so it&#x27;s more than paid for itself.  Plus it&#x27;s saved me time and annoyance.  I wish I had purchased it sooner!    Thank you to all of you who posted reviews with tips on how to use this epilator.  They were very helpful!</li>
    <li> very easy to use and efficient.  I enjoy using it every 2 weeks , it will take me 10 mn to finish my legs wich is perfect.  the first minute, I would feel some pain, then it turns very smooth ...</li>
    <li> I read some complaints of painful use but I have not experienced that.  If there were a smaller trimmer attachment this would be 6 stars product!</li>
    <li> Works beutifully, has the roller for wimps and once you get used to it, makes life oh so easy. I actually bought this for my younger daughter, the eldest has already been using one sporadically for a couple of years. I have been using one for twenty years and as a result the hair on my legs is barely visible even when I skip a month(!) - and I&#x27;m a brunette so the hair is black, just grows reeeeaally thin now. I&#x27;ve stuck with the Braun as they seem to last forever. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I hate shaving, little pain worth the smoothness.</li>
    <li> Used it a few times.  It&#x27;s painful and time consuming.  Switched to waxing.</li>
    <li> And it nips at the skin more often than my first Braun epilator. using the cover helps but I use it under my arms where it&#x27;s a little trickier to keep the skin stretched. The little engine is very loud, especially in a tiled bathroom. Good for the price I payed but I really wished the wheels on my old one hadn&#x27;t worn out.</li>
    <li> I had this epilator for years and I loved it. It fits in your hand great, with its unique design. It has an nice solid color, and removes the hair nicely. when it recently gave out on me I went looking for a new one. I can&#x27;t find this model anywhere, everytime I buy it from sellers off of eBay or Amazon they send me the newer model with the front light instead because they no longer have this one. The newer model is ok but just doesn&#x27;t have as solid of a feel as the older model.</li>
    <li> I bought it from Bed bath and beyond 5 years ago. I take it whenever I travel. I absolutely love it.  I actually use it everywhere on my body except over my lip; it hurts over there more than waxing.  But I love the fact that it removes even the shortest hair efficiently. When I started using it, I found it hurtful, but after using it regularly, I got used to it and it hurts less now as the hair grew thinner with continuous use. Here is an advice: even though it is great if you can wait till all your hair grows out before removing it, so you wait a longer period of time before removing again, but for me, I find it better to remove hair as they start coming out, in which case, I have to remove hair twice a month. And that is fine with me since it hurts less having less hair. I recommended it to a friend and she bought it the same day and raves about it.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun epilator I have owned and I&#x27;ve had the same thing go wrong with both units. The cord/connection goes bad. If you jiggle the cord at the connecting point you can get it to keep going but as soon as you let go, it goes off again. So, good product but it only lasts about 1-2 years.</li>
    <li> I had a Phillips epilator that lasted long and had a massage head to ease the pain. This Braun epilator does not have one, plus it bruises my skin. This makes it impossible to cover the bikini area because it is very painful. I have to go over the leg area more than three times to get all the hair out. It does not come with a pouch, it is not rechargeable. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> This Silk-epil is really great! U don&#x27;t feel that much of a pain and comparing to wax, I think it&#x27;s way better! I have coarse and black hair but with this porduct, my hair is minimum for like 1 week!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in 2009. It has suddenly stopped working. Long before this it became less effective. I am not sure what has happened, but this is very disappointing for a product that is not low in cost. I will write to the manufacturer and see if they will provide a replacement or repair this one.    When I called BRAUN they refused to take back the item. Instead they want me to pay for it to be repaired. Please avoid this product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased and worn out 3 of the Epilady brand hair removers and will never go back to that brand again.  It is poorly designed and they all quit working because the cogs wore out and would come off.  I purchased the Braun hoping it had a better design and so far am thrilled with not only how fast it is, but how it removes the hair much better.  I think I will love using this product.  I purchased one for my daughter as well.</li>
    <li> i was sceptical, but the product really works great. it doesnt cut the hair, they are actually uprooted as you can see the root head on the hair that has been removed. it hurts first time but the third time i dont feel a thing. i have tried my armpits and its painful but im hoping to have similar results as my leg, less pain with each use. I love the convenience of having hair removed for a while. legs feel smooth and soft. I used to use a razor and my legs would look like chicken legs with bumps all over the place. this is slowly going away. i never knew how others achieved this. braun is a good brand as well. the epilator is not expensive yet does the job. buy it and buy a scrubbing sponge to exfoliate so you dont get ingrown hairs. first time do it before you go to bed. in the morning you&#x27;ll love the results</li>
    <li> It hurts a little bit, but, with the years de hair growth stop. I have 7 years with this epilator.</li>
    <li> Well, it works great when you&#x27;re prepared for PAIN :) Yes, it&#x27;ll be painful and once you know it, this item doesn&#x27;t seem like a bad one. In fact, it saves you a lot of time. Of course, wax is faster, but, hey...a whole-body wax procedure is gonna be more expensive than this item. So, if you can stand pain (it&#x27;s not more painful, than waxing), and you want to save money, then this item is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.  I ordered a new one because the old one didn&#x27;t work in the US (I&#x27;m from Europe) and it didn&#x27;t disappoint me, of course.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt and you can see that hair start growing less frequently and way more thin than before, right after the first time you use it.  I highly recommend it!    I would avoid using it for underarms, I think it&#x27;s perfect for legs and good for bikini (though I prefer to wax that part).</li>
    <li> Back in the 90&#x27;s I used the EPILADY, but it has since been d/c&#x27;d.  I have no, and I mean NO, problem with hair extraction on my legs.  Underarms, I&#x27;ll use a razor, but I experience no pain on my legs.  I have been waxing for years so my hair now is rather fine and sparse.  With the cost of salon waxings, this product has paid for itself many times over.  If you are a staunch waxer, save yourself some money and purchase this little dandy. Everytime I would go in for a wax, the girls would inevitably miss some hair and they were all bent out of shape when I asked them to go over my legs with tweezers.  And sometimes they would change from tea tree to honey waxes, which never worked on my legs.  I am sold for life on epilators.  I purchased this on Amazon after reading great reviews plus I liked the pink color.  I gave this product 5 stars, I do love it, however, the loud, almost chainsaw sound when you turn it on is a little off-setting.  The beaded attachment has done me no good whatsoever, I use the tweezers smack dab right on my leg.  And I wish it were a re-chargeable item.  The only way this will work is with an electrical plug, which isn&#x27;t very long.  Overall I love the product.  It&#x27;s a must for someone who isn&#x27;t squeamish about hair extraction, and I know lot of women are.</li>
    <li> Ok. It took a while but it works! Make sure to exfoliate and open your pores up with warm water. I did not see the best of results the first time. But from the second and third time I was seeing less hair growth! It does not get all the hairs but gets most! It works for my legs but definitely not on my arms...and yes you need patience with this machine it takes a while, but I would definitely not go back to shaving my legs!!</li>
    <li> I just got this a few days ago. I&#x27;ve never epilated, but I have waxed (paid for pros as well as done it myself). Like everyone else reviewing this, I was tired of the cost of the pros, the messiness of doing it myself, and the need to let hair grow longer than desired in order to wax. I was also tired of the razor routine. The creams by Nair and other companies don&#x27;t work for me; I always have a horrible reaction, so I must be allergic to an ingredient. So I figured I&#x27;d try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for the first time yesterday, on my legs. I had waited two days since last shaving as per the advice of other reviewers (and by the way, a big thanks to all the other reviewers here who gave such good tips and info!). Did both legs in one go, without any numbing creams and going right to the highest setting. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve figured out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Pain - well, there is a sensation. Whether you&#x27;ll label it \\&quot;pain\\&quot; or not depends on your pain threshold. I have tatoos, and as mentioned, I&#x27;ve done the wax routine. This \\&quot;hurt\\&quot;, as in, it felt like small rubber bands snapping against my skin, at first, but the longer I used it - even though I was covering \\&quot;new territory\\&quot; as I worked up and around my legs - the sensation reduced until it started feeling almost like being scratched vigorously by fingernails. I&#x27;m assuming that some hormone or other was released by my body once it figured out that the sensation was going to continue for a while, and that hormone or other chemical worked to decrease the sensitivity of my nerve endings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I had no red bumps or such after I was done. What I DID have was a short period of intense itchiness on my legs. I resisted scratching, and I did not use anything (ice packs or whatever). I just waited it out. After about an hour (give or take - I didn&#x27;t time it), the itchiness stopped. This morning, my legs are fine - no redness or any other signs of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There are two \\&quot;heads\\&quot;, one white, one pink. I&#x27;m not sure what either do, as I didn&#x27;t read the manual very closely (this is a pretty simple thing to figure out how to operate, after all). I tried both, and didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in sensation between the two. This might be just ME - others may have different experiences. I tried the low and high settings with both heads, and again, didn&#x27;t notice much of any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and took a shower and used a loofah right before using this. Dunno if that really helped in the overall process, but I do plan to keep doing it, as getting dead skin cells out of the way of this machine seems like it&#x27;ll help it do it&#x27;s job better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It got off a fair amount of hair, but not all. I had to go over some areas more than once, and I had to change the angle of \\&quot;attack\\&quot; at different places along my legs. I understand that this is an iterative process, that some new hair growth simply may not be long enough for the machine to yank, and thus the need to repeat multiple times over the first few weeks until you&#x27;ve \\&quot;laid down a base\\&quot; (as it were) and gotten every hair follicle at least once. After that, it&#x27;s my understanding that over time, as new hair grows in, it&#x27;ll be finer, softer, easier to yank, and will grow back more slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I can see how, over a long enough time span, this will lead to being more and more hair free, as more and more hair follicles are ripped out at the roots and the growth is slowed down across more and more of a \\&quot;span\\&quot; on one&#x27;s legs. In the meantime, this will probably require as much frequency of use as a normal razor, meaning every two or three days. But I am aware from the reviews that once epilation has been done for a longer time (say six months or so), the time in between uses can be increased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. I can already see how this will save me money from no longer needing to replace razor blades and shaving cream. I also can see how over time, as less hair grows back and one only needs to do touchups in spots, the overall time spent on this will decrease as well (compared to shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. I have not yet used it on underarms or bikini area, but will do so in the next few days. I expect that both of those areas will be more sensitive than my legs, and I&#x27;m not exactly looking forward to it....but there are always tradeoffs. Waxing in the bikini area isn&#x27;t exactly painless after all, and it requires multiple things - wax, spatula, fabric strips, keeping the wax at the proper heat, and so on - just to get the job done. I&#x27;ll gladly endure a higher pain level in trade for something faster and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re looking for total smoothness right off the bat, you&#x27;re probably not going to get it, simply due to the nature of epilation. It WILL take some time to eventually yank every single hair out at the roots as each hair is in a different stage of growth on any given day. But once you have achieved that at least once, or a couple of times, I can see how over time, you&#x27;ll get the desired stubble free smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can shrug off paper cuts and other minor pains (I can), then you&#x27;ll probably be able to tolerate the sensation of this thing. If you don&#x27;t handle such sensations well, you may wish to forego this method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the noise, yes, it is noisy, but not overly so. Close your bathroom door and you&#x27;ll keep most of the sound in the room with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the corded version as it allows you to get the job done in one sitting without having to recharge or blow through batteries. The cord is plenty long for me, but I have an outlet right above the toiilet, and I just sat on top of the toilet to use this and extended my legs over the tub in case any hairs dropped down (a very few did - the showerhead washed it all away in seconds). If you don&#x27;t have an outlet convenient to a toilet or stool that you can sit on, use an extension cord and you should be able to work something out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I had tried an Epilady back in the 90&#x27;s, and what I remember was excruciating pain. It was so painful that I used the Epilady exactly once and never again. It&#x27;s taken me all this time to give epilation a try again. I don&#x27;t know if my pain tolerance has gone up or not, but from the comments in the other reviews, it seems that the epilation technology has been improved to cause less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is my new method for hair removal, probably for the rest of my life. If that changes for any reason attributable to this device, I&#x27;ll come back and update this review. If I don&#x27;t update, you&#x27;ll know that my comments here stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps others in one way or another, as the prior reviews helped me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only four stars because the manual isn&#x27;t very helpful on how to clean this device and what the different heads (white and pink) are for. I prefer written instructions to little drawings, and the manual for this thing seems to depend heavily on diagrams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the device itself - five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE July 1, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did my armpits yesterday after showering. Again, there was a sensation; whether you&#x27;d identify it as \\&quot;pain\\&quot; or not will be individual. I was able to shrug it off. It causes more of a sensation than dragging a razor across, but definitely well within my tolerance level. I&#x27;ll continue to use this for my armpits as well as my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the legs a second time as well (touch up - first one needed since my first-ever use of this device on 6.23.11). Worked well, and this time the sensation I felt was less than previously. Also no itchiness afterwards (yay!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve most definitely found my hair removal method for the rest of my life for legs and armpits. Bikini area still to be tested; I&#x27;ll update again once I give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AUGUST 4, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just used this again for leg touchups. I&#x27;ve been using it reasonably consistently, every few days, and one use of the old razor and shaving cream for a time when I wanted super smooth legs. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this device since the shave, and the itchiness is back - though it&#x27;s considerably less than the very first time I ever used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this might be something to be aware of: if you use this, and only this, the itchiness doesn&#x27;t even show up. If you use a razor at one point, apparently the next time you use epilate, you&#x27;ll have itchiness again, though again, to a much lesser degree than the initial time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why this is. I have no idea if anyone else has experienced, or will experience, the itchiness that I have. I&#x27;m just reporting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is JUST a report/update. The itchiness I am feeling now is very minor, easily ignored, and per how things went the very first time I felt the itchiness, I expect this current itchiness to go away fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> It does an amazing job. I purchased it after my epilady wasn&#x27;t charging anymore and I more than glad that I got it. It gets the job done much faster.</li>
    <li> In use the product was great. If you are used to shaving and have thick hair it can be very painful your first few tries. After that your hair comes back thinner and it becomes a lot easier to use, assuming you don&#x27;t wait for all of your hair to grow back thick and long again (usually takes a couple weeks to grow out little thin ones that you can barely feel when epilating). Some of the thinner hairs, like I experienced on my upper thighs, were surprisingly painful though, and it felt like a small burning sensation. I had a lot of trouble with ingrown hairs as well, and I only used it on my legs. If you can deal with the pain, I highly recommend an epilator.  The problem I have with this particular one is that it just stopped working out of the blue after a year. That&#x27;s only about 12-15 uses. I don&#x27;t know if it is the cable or actual device, but it won&#x27;t turn on. That was disappointing, but when it was working it was great though.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is very good and tough. I have mine since 2009 and he fell from everywhere and nothing has changed, it is very good and I do not regret having bought.</li>
    <li> The worst epliator ever! Do not buy! Mine was defective and neither Amazon or the seller will refund my money because I opened it and used it. Duh! How was I supposed to know that it didn&#x27;t work when I opened it.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 years ago and has been my main hair removal &#x27;technique&#x27; ever since. When you read this keep in mind I never used any other epilator and had been waxing for about 20 years so I&#x27;m used to the pain when it comes to this stuff. That being said, when you use this machine on your legs is only a minor discomfort and sometimes you have to pass again the same area, but so do you have to when you wax or use other razors, not all hair comes at once. I also use it in my armpit area and it is a bit painful there, but nothing unbearable and does it fast so is very convenient. Compared to melting wax and pulling it out is less painful and more convenient. I&#x27;ve also used it in the bikini area a couple of times, again, more painful there but if the hair is not long and I don&#x27;t have too many, i can take it and be pool ready in 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I think is important the hair is the right length, not too long or it&#x27;d hurt when pulling it and if is too short it won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend to other people and have recommended to a friend that asked me what kind of hair removal product I used and I think she got it too.</li>
    <li> This was awful, didn&#x27;t do anything! I returned it within a few days for a full refund, do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> The thing that caught my attention about this product was that it&#x27;s supposed to work on hair as short as 0.5 millimeters.  Well guess what?  It does work.  I found that hair removal is easiest right after a shower.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun Epilator for several months, and once I figured out some of the major do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s I couldn&#x27;t be happier. After all this time it still takes slightly more time to use than shaving, but I only use it every week or two. There is a great deal of freedom in being able to put on a sleeveless top and shorts in the morning when I haven&#x27;t even showered.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things to keep in mind: &lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t shaved in the last few days or epilated in the last few weeks, then the hair may be fairly thick and long. The epilator is a little more uncomfortable when the hair is long (because it tends to grab it from the end instead of the base). If the hair is long but thin it isn&#x27;t much of a problem, but if you&#x27;ve grown a thick crop then it can get painful. Instead, shave the area and wait until the hair is just long enough for the epilator to grab it easily. On me this is usually a couple days&#x27; growth. This will be much more comfortable. When the hair grows back in it will be thinner and the process should not need repeating.&lt;br /&gt;Also, exfoliate. Get a good non-facial oil-based exfoliating scrub. (Mine is a sugar scrub from Bath and Body Works.) I epilate on the weekend every week or two. I start my process by washing and exfoliating my legs. This is a quick process. Then I epilate. This helps in a few ways:&lt;br /&gt;First, I sometimes get a few hairs growing under a thin layer of skin. This is most likely to happen around the knees. The exfoliating gets many of these uncovered so that the epilator can grab them.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the oil residue on my legs helps keep the skin healthy through the process. Tearing out the hair follicle causes a slight irritation and that helps.&lt;br /&gt;Third, I found that once I switched from shaving I was missing the slight exfoliation that a daily scrape with a razor provides. Using the scrub every week or two is enough to keep my legs from looking dry.</li>
    <li> I just received this as a Christmas gift, but I\\&quot;ve used it already!&lt;BR&gt;The first time I used it was on the bikini line.  I had read some reviews before asking for this for Christmas.  Some folks said it was terribly painful.  I did not find that to be the case at all on my bikini line.  Of course I have been waxing for a number of years.  In fact, this was no where near as bad as waxing.&lt;BR&gt;I used it the next day on my underarms and must admit that this was somewhat uncomfortable.  Probably because I have never waxed here, only shaved.&lt;BR&gt;I love the smooth finish, and the lack of bumps!&lt;BR&gt;I will never go back to shaving or waxing!&lt;BR&gt;Great, easy to use product!</li>
    <li> This product is surprisingly lightweight and easy to use. It efficiently removes a majority of hair from the root. It&#x27;s time consuming and requires you to go over the same area several times before all the hair is removed. I recommend going over a small area at a time and making sure all the hair is removed before moving to a new area, otherwise, you will just have to end up going back. My skin is somewhat sensitive yet, to my surprise, I did not experience any red bumps.  &lt;br /&gt;The removal of the hair is uncomfortable but not painful. The more you use the product, the more the skin gets accustomed to the discomfort. If you don&#x27;t like the mess and expense of waxing, this product will serve as a great replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product to anyone who has purchased epilators in the past and to those who are trying it for the first time. This was my first epilator. Those of you who are first-timers, I recommend you give this product a try and put your scepticism aside. I think that after you get used to using it, you will be sold on it and even recommend it to your friends and family as I have done already.</li>
    <li> Hated waxing, shaving and Nair. LOVE this. Hurts less than waxing or razor burn. It&#x27;s a bit louder than an electric toothbrush, but not horrible. Although it did break off some hairs, going back over them took care of those, so no stubble. Easy to clean, too. I suppose the amount of time required depends on the amount of hair, but I found this to be less messy, smelly and time-consuming than Nair or do-it-yourself-wax. I also found it to be a little addicting, because it&#x27;s just too easy.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 8 months. The pain became quickly tolerable, but did leave my pores red and inflammed for about 24hrs after each time used. Not good if you want to go bare-legged the day after use. I liked that the regrowth was not nearly as dense (visible) and scratchy as after shaving; however, this doesn&#x27;t come remotely close to the silky smooth feeling of shaving. I found that I used the gadget fairly often because I didn&#x27;t like all the &amp;quot;missed&amp;quot; hairs and regrowth. Thus, for me, this became very labor intensive--much more so than shaving. I really missed the silky smoothness from shaving. The biggest downfall for sure was the ingrown hairs-horrible. I use a buff on my body with every daily shower, but this did not seem to help. The bikini area was the worst for ingrown hairs-and they take weeks to work themselves out! Red, swollen, terribly unsightly bumps-NOT attractive! After about 5 months I began getting ingrown hairs on my legs-more than a dozen on each leg. I look like I&#x27;ve been truly eaten alive by bugs! Nasty, nasty, nasty! Unlike bug bites, these are taking WEEKS to resolve. If it weren&#x27;t for the terrible ingrown hairs, I might have continued to use this product intermittently. So, if you are not prone to getting ingrown hairs then you may like this device. I had no prior history with skin problems (sensitivty, breakouts, ingrown hairs, or razor burn) before using an epilator. I can&#x27;t wait for all these terrible blemishes to clear up. PS Try this in the Winter!</li>
    <li> Compared to the epilady of the 90&#x27;s (?) this thing works so much better. The pain is no where near the epilady. Mainly because the epilady&#x27;s motor slowed down when it would grab the hair tugging on it before yanking it out. This Braun yanks the hair out FAST! It stilln hurts but definitely not as bad as that old torture device that gave epilators a bad name. &lt;br /&gt;The hair grows in finer and much much less noticeable. Being the hair is essentially plucked it doesn&#x27;t grow back in as quickly as shaved does. It also grows back in stages so  you look like you have less growth. I love this thing. I use it about 1x a week to get any stray hairs. Plus I don&#x27;t have to let my legs get hairy like an ape like you do when you go waxing. So I definitely recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Worked ok.  Painful.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, would rather wax or shave.  Ah well, at least we tried.  Only seems to work with very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to get all the hairs since it&#x27;s pretty much a random plucking device but for what it does, it works pretty darn well. My only problem is THE NOISE. Holy heck, the noise is amazing! It&#x27;s really too much for my ears after a few minutes. Too be honest, it&#x27;s enough to make me want to find something else, which is really too bad as it works great. So I&#x27;m only taking off 1 star because it works but the sound may be a deterrent for some.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to purchase this product after the disaster I had with the first Epi-Lady that came out.  Talk about painful.  Being a brunette, the hair on my face, arms and legs are not light.  I tried it on my arm first and the hair came right off.  The first use was not really painful but it had a warm tingling sensation - kind of like getting a tattoo.  I then used it on my face where I am plagued with chin whiskers.  I took them right out and I didn&#x27;t feel a thing.  It was wonderful.  What took me an hour to pluck before was done in less than 3 minutes.  It didn&#x27;t get every hair but I&#x27;d say it got 90% of them and I just waited another day, went over the area again and got the rest.  I did try it on my underarm and again, it worked like a charm.  I&#x27;m not interested in using in on my legs as it&#x27;s just easier to shave them but for those of you who have the chin/mustache hair that won&#x27;t go away, GET THIS PRODUCT.  It works better than tweezing, waxing, Nair etc.  I&#x27;ve already recomended it to many of my friends and they are anxious to get theres.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great and it lasts a lot longer than shaving! The product is not very painful and definately worth a try.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00006592X Braun Soft Perfection SE3170 Epilator, Pink]]  This Braun epilator is fantastic.  It gets rid of coarse, fast-growing hair without effort and stays that way for days.  Easy to use.  No more worries about day-2 stubble.</li>
    <li> I had an older version of this product; it is a neat little apparatus; it is the next best thing to waxing!    Product arrived in perfect condition and on time; thanks.</li>
    <li> Very good product. The header does help exfoliate your skin before you remove your hair, but you may want to do a last pass without it for better results.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing my legs for the last 7 years and am so ecstatic to find an alternative!  I don&#x27;t have any experience with other epilators, but this one is great!  Feels a little funny at first, but not nearly as painful as some of the other reviews make it sound.  If you&#x27;re used to waxing, it won&#x27;t hurt.  And even if you&#x27;re not used to waxing, after the first few times it gets easier.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;m a fan of waxing (no shaving and growing a beard on my legs, thank you) but the problem with waxing is that it takes some \\&quot;setup\\&quot; time and it never seems to fit in my schedule. Also, it&#x27;ll rip off the little bit of tan I manage to obtain...  This little machine regularly saves me from embarrassing legs - or from wearing long pants in 100 degree weather.  Cons:  We&#x27;ve heard it, yes it hurts some. Less than waxing, but still. Tip #1: Don&#x27;t use it the few days before your period, skin is too sensitive. Tip #2: the first time is the most painful. After that, if you keep it up every week or two, there won&#x27;t be near as much hair to pull out. Armpits are painful too. But how nice it is not to have to shave them everyday!  Also, it doesn&#x27;t always get everything out evenly, sometimes leaves stubble or ingrown hair. Solution: once in a while, take a good 10 minutes to work \\&quot;up close\\&quot; and get all the hair. And do a good scrub with a loofah when you shower.  Pros:  Quick, simple, no set up: you can grab the epilator 2 minutes before you walk out of the door. Fewer hair grows back every time, so after a while, even if I forget to use it for a week, there aren&#x27;t enough hair growing for people to notice. It definitely pays for itself: I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years now. It&#x27;s quick and compact, travelling with it is easy and TSA will let you carry it (as opposed to razors). The cord is very long, so no need to play Twister while using it. All in all, just a very good and useful product. Try it!</li>
    <li> I bought this it for use when I&#x27;m in the US. It was certainly useful during my last visit there.</li>
    <li> i dread using this thing, but it is the only way i can handle my south asian hairy monster legs. when i am too afraid to use it, i pay the price (and so does my boyfriend) for the next month or so. beware, you worst best friend</li>
    <li> I have ch-used this product because I always been satisfied with Braun company! This product works very well too! No pain.</li>
    <li> It hurts a lot and some times it scratches my skin.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and followed what most people said to do (use after showering, exfoliate, make sure the hair isn&#x27;t too long or short, etc), but it just wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It would never pull all the hairs out; it always left stubble, which I then would go back over with my razor.  I just didn&#x27;t see the point of using it when I had to use my razor anyways.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because of the hairs it did get they seemed to not grow back as fast.</li>
    <li> And so am I. Her legs and bikini line are now smooth, and hair lasts longer to grow. It does exactly what it says. We are now getting some lidocaine to avoid the pain, that never went away.</li>
    <li> Five stars because is been over a year since i got it and still is working great. You have pass it over the area a couple of times in order to get clean results but at the end you will live it. Easy to take with you on vacations, easy to clean and let me tell you is saving me a lots of money since I don&#x27;t go to get my wax done anymore.&lt;br /&gt;And more thing at the beginning is painful in your bikini area but hey so is wax!</li>
    <li> My mom was the one who introduced me to Braun Epilators. When I was shopping for one, I came across Epilady. I thought I&#x27;d give EpiGirl a try. What a mistake! It was so low quality. I returned it immediately and purchased the Braun on Amazon. It&#x27;s fab! I love not having to shave for weeks. The initial times, it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable. But you seem to become numb to the pain. After a few times, its doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year; my mom for seven. Highly recommend this to anyone... and I realized that mom&#x27;s are always right!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the claims of seriously-reduced or no pain and expected to return the epilator the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong!!  I felt only a slight pinching-type sensation (not *really* pinching the skin, mind you) the first time I used it.  I cannot call the sensation &amp;quot;pain&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;discomfort&amp;quot; is closer to the mark.  The second time I used it was after a hot shower, and I had no discomfort whatsoever.  The third try was the charm: no hot shower first, and no discomfort, either.&lt;br /&gt;Then again, I&#x27;ve been known to have a high pain threshold, just like my parents.  Maybe this has something to do with the lack of discomfort shortly after beginning use of the epilator.  Note that I am someone who has never been pained by salon leg waxing (unless, of course, the wax was too hot! LOL).  The heat in the wax in a salon and the heat of a hot shower/bath are, in my mind comparable, and this is probably why my second use of the epilator was pain-free.&lt;br /&gt;So, in my mind, never try ANY epilator for the first time without a hot shower/bath first. &lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, my final comment/observation/advice is this: If you are a baby when it comes to salon waxing, mild sunburns, or cat scratches, stay away from ALL epilators because you&#x27;ll probably start complaining the first time (or few times) you use ANY epilator.  If, however, you are the type of person that says, &amp;quot;Bah, that didn&#x27;t really hurt!&amp;quot; when others wince at what you consider minor and silly things, then epilators ARE for you, and this one in particular is the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;PS: I find myself epilating only slightly less often than I used to shave because I am VERY light-skinned but my leg/armpit hair is almost black.  This means that it&#x27;s VISIBLE long before it is FEEL-ABLE.  (The 1/2-mm claim is also accurate.) I don&#x27;t mind epilating twice a week, though, because the INCREDIBLY tough and dry skin on my shins has vanished and I don&#x27;t have to look for scabs anymore when I want to wear a skirt and stockings!  :-)</li>
    <li> Granted, I am no wimp when it comes to waxing and plucking. I just hate the process of waxing and then plucking to get rid of the strays that waxing missed. I also hate it when you inadvertently get wax stuck to a patch of hair that isn&#x27;t meant to come out. Having said all that, this epilator works very well. It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than waxing (I think much less) and it&#x27;s a very quick process. The only complaint I have is that it occasionally misses a hair or two, no matter what angle you go at it. But there&#x27;s no cleanup (except for the quick brushing of the tweezer part) and it all stores away in a cute little pouch. I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to finally buy one of these!</li>
    <li> I love my Braun Silk-epil!  I have been using it for about 12 weeks now and can only say that it&#x27;s great!  I only had pain the first time I used it and that was around my ankles, knees, and underarms.  Now I use it to touch up and don&#x27;t wait for the hair to get too long and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  If anything, I&#x27;d call it a tingling sensation.  It really does last longer than shaving.  I only use the EverSoft attachment on my face now, although the first time I used the Silk-epil I did use the attachment all the time.  I use the Silk-epil on my legs, arms, underarms, and even on my face.  The only place where I can say I have some pain in on my upper lip, but it&#x27;s manageable.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I use it while watching television so don&#x27;t mind the time.  It&#x27;s a lot like an electric razor in that you do need to go over an area more than once to pick up all the hairs.  My sister has used one for awhile and warned me that it was real painful the first time.  I didn&#x27;t feel that way but everyone&#x27;s pain threshold is different.  But for me it was a great purchase and I&#x27;d do it again in a minute.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a bit loud, but does its job perfectly; pulls out even the smallest and finest hair; would recommend!</li>
    <li> This was money well spent and the beauty of it is that it works. shave once and hair&#x27;s gone. It stings at first but once you get going it feels great. Awesome for underarm hair removal. Easy maintenance. I recommend this product who&#x27;s looking for something other than the razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and it&#x27;s great. I read a lot of reviews of the top selling products in amazon and I decided to get this one, right price for good quality brand [I wish this one is blue though].     My only shaving area was my underarm and everybody complain about the pain of epilating underarm, so I was prepared. Turnout, it was ok, I didn&#x27;t feel much pain. I guess I was one of the lucky one that have not much hair to deal with in the first place and I think that the massage rollers head did help a little. Now I&#x27;m glad that I could say goodbye to \\&quot;everyday shaving\\&quot; forever. Get it now!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not that i have a defective one or anything, i just hate this epilator. i&#x27;d never tried epilating before, and after researching it, bought this one. i was really excited to use it, but it sucks! i could only ever stand the pain AT ALL using on my underarms, and there it only removes about 1/2 the hairs, even if you spend a long time doing it.    DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> This is the best one I have tried so far. I actually bought it for my Mom, first, then got to try it and it&#x27;s great. Now I just got one for myself. You do have to get a new epilator after a while. I can go with the same one for about 3 years so it is worth the money by far. Especially comparing it to the money you spend getting waxed every time or the mess doing it at home. I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years and I love it!    Now I am disappointed that it does not come with the bag as it states in the description, not only that but there is an empty spot in the box of both epilators I got, so it looks like something else should have come in the box and was taken out. So someone please fix that description so you don&#x27;t give the wrong information to customers or please send me the bags.    Just as an update to the above parragraph, I emailed amazon about that and they were really nice about it and within hours I got a confirmation of a new shipment where they are replacing the whole thing as a set, since they could send me just the bag. So I&#x27;ll be getting the bag for at least one of them. Now that is good service right? With this kind of response I don&#x27;t mind at all having to go to the post office to return something. I have to say Amazon always treats their customers right!</li>
    <li> My old one finally quit and this one is even better.  I mostly use this on my underarms, it eliminates that gray shadow and cuts down on shaving.  I periodically use on my legs and bikini line during the summer.  Once the hair is softer and thinner, after the initial use, it isn&#x27;t so painful... or maybe I am just used to it.</li>
    <li> If you are a woman and you need this above the neck, I sympathize. The women of my family have had the same issue and honestly. I think most women have the same problem. Electrolysis did not work in this facial area and could never work, because the pain involved in treating the area just under the nose is enormous and intolerable. I epilate the area twice a week and it is of course not a pleasant experience but it only lasts a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Smelly and nasty hair removal creams do not work very well. take a long time ( 15 minutes) and irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  The rollers that are supposed to decrease pain are useless.  All that attachment seems to do is make the unit less effective.  Using the regular attachment without the rollers works a little better, but still left way too much hair behind.  I have waxed for years so there isn&#x27;t much pain for me.  On the other hand, that should also make my hair easier to remove and this still didn&#x27;t do even a halfway decent job.  I have returned it and will try something else.</li>
    <li> No complaints here. It does the job well, my skin is nice and smooth after I use Braun SE3170. For the last 10 years I have been using Braun Epilators and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with the outcome. This is a good product, easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> OMG i don&#x27;t even remember anymore when I bought it- like 5 years ago?! And it still works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made!</li>
    <li> This thing is cool. Im glad i purchased it. I thought why not give it a try. You should too :)</li>
    <li> bad machine, painfull and not efficiant. i would never buy OR RECOMMEND. TRY TO RETURN THEY HAVE 14 DAY RETURN POLICY ONLY. RIPE OFF.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s how you have to go into this. If you think about it, a leg wax costs about $55 or more each time and this little machines costs $55 and you can do it whenever you want. It hurt like all hell the first time since I had let them grow out (a little too much I think) but now I just pull it out whenever and start pulling those little pesky leg hairs out! I am ready for beach season.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an earlier model I used for 11 years until it pooped out from overwork. It is easy to use and I love the LED light. I use this not as a timesaver, but because it leaves a softer texture than shaving if you are very hairy like I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT A TIMESAVER FOR THE HAIRY LADIES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman of latin american, mediterranean and northern european heritage. I am so hairy I had to begin shaving my legs daily at age ten. Also around then I had to start constant maintenance on facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE: This Braun is a life saver for facial maintenance. I use it daily, for faster removal over large areas. BUT I have to do detail touch up with surgical quality tweezers and magnifying mirror several times a week. Also daily facial cleanings with textured blemish pads to prevent hair follicle breakouts are a must. NOT recommended for use near eyes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LEGS and UNDERARM: if you are a daily shaver like I was, you WILL have to touch up every 1-3 days. I find that during the summer I have to do the whole job weekly, with a few touch up days between. This means you spend as much or more time with the Braun as with shaving. Because my follicles are so robust, I have to make each pass with the Braun quite slowly for thoroughness&#x27; sake. I have been epilating for about 12 years with zero change in growth rate or hair texture. The regrowth has a more tapered end than with the blunt cut from shaving, so the skin feels smoother longer and hair regrowth is slightly less noticeable for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIKINI AREA: I have tried this a couple of times, after shaving and allowing several mm regrowth. The hair follicles bled and a few hairs grew inward and scarred. I do not recommend you use the Braun in this area if you have to shave or wax there aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: I really cannot live without this until I can afford permanent laser removal, but my best advantage is a softer finish than shaving, rather than any time saved. Hope this helps other girls like me!saved. Hope this helps other girls like me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d experimented with different hair removal methods -- waxing seemed to get the best results for me in general, but I didn&#x27;t like actually dealing with the wax, the sticky mess, the expense of having to replenish it, etc. So I decided to try an epilator since it eliminated most of what I disliked about waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing was fantastic! Like others said, it was even addicting at times! Admittedly, over the years the novelty wore off and I came to use it less enthusiastically; but still it could take off facial hair or leg hair with less trouble than waxing. Only trouble I had was that I sometimes wanted to get a precision area done and it might be too wide; and sometimes in very sensitive areas, if I didn&#x27;t hold the skin taught enough it could catch the skin and scratch/tear it. But I&#x27;d had similar issues with waxing, and all in all I didn&#x27;t find any problems with this that weren&#x27;t also found in other hair-removal methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device lasted about 5 years before it went on the fritz -- I&#x27;d be using it and it would just stop working, like it shut itself off. Turning it off an on, or unplugging it then plugging it back helped at first, but then less and less frequently, and the machine would jam more and more often. Unfortunately this same model doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s available anymore, so I may have to risk another type (the newer Braun models seem to be more expensive and often have features I don&#x27;t care for.)</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Yes, it does hurt.....like crazy!! Expecially the first couple of times that you use it but it does get better. My only negative is that you never get that silky smoothe feeling like you do from shaving but then again the new hair growing in is not as coarse.</li>
    <li> I think my daughter liked it. I researched reviews and prices and found this. Electric is a must, so I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll have it for years</li>
    <li> Love it!  One of the best products I have ever bought.  Have had it over four years.  Still working.  Great price!</li>
    <li> Easier, cleaner and less time consuming than waxing although I felt it to be a little more painful (more so because waxing is one quick pull whereas this a more continuous process I guess!). With regular use I see lesser hair growth which is good. However beware of some ingrown hair and make sure to exfoliate properly! Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this 3 years ago and it still works great. I definitely recommend it. After using an epilator for a while you won&#x27;t even feel the pain anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this product, after using it for about two years or so now, I don&#x27;t have to use so often, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow as fast and has stopped growing in certain parts of my leg.  You must be able to endure some pain (unless you have a high tolerance for pain), but after you keep you using it, the pain gets less and less, I use it on my legs and underarms (legs not so painful), but bikini area hurts a little too much for me.</li>
    <li> Does a good job and has held up well.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t pluck the hairs out: I went over the area 20 + times in a row but it just didn&#x27;t pluck certain hairs out. I&#x27;m a natural blonde with medium-sized leg hairs so perhaps would work better with thicker leg hair?</li>
    <li> It is much more prone to cause skin irritation, than others I have used. It goes unused most of the time.</li>
    <li> It works great, but if you don&#x27;t like the feeling of being electrically shocked, then it&#x27;s not for you. It doesn&#x27;t literally shock you btw, that&#x27;s just the best way I can describe the pain. I literally bite down on a tooth brush when I use it. no lie, I&#x27;m a wimp.</li>
    <li> If you do not like to shave, like me, this could be your friend.  Be aware that it involves a little bit of pain, but is it specially useful for your summer vacations or winter, when you do not want the burdain of shaving.  I even do my underarms...</li>
