      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and a great scrub compared to others I&#x27;ve had.</li>

      <li>Very light and easy to pack to take on trips.  </li>
      <li>It is large, though, so it works best on the main problem areas.</li>
      <li>and it is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy and this was just what I wanted to smooth the edges of my heels.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>For dry feet it is great though.</li>

      <li>It works perfectly and will last a long time.</li>
      <li>Took a while to get it but worth the wait.  </li>

      <li>for the first week, it did work well....</li>

      <li>My feet are smoother thanks to this...</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Good to have, especially for those who wear rough footwear all the time like boots.</li>
      <li>Texture not too light or rough, just right.</li>
      <li>other than that it functions OK.</li>
      <li>I had to go back to my old wand (luckily, I hadn&#x27;t thrown it away before I got this).</li>
      <li>I had this sitting on a shelf in my shower (not under direct flow of water ever, just off to the side), and within about a week, all the scraping paper had peeled off.  </li>
      <li>If it gets clogged after to many filings you can just rinse it down with water and let it dry</li>
      <li>Works great, but I pressed too hard and it snapped with no warning, basically hard plastic that couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
      <li>Peeled down when I first tried to use on my foot.</li>
      <li>The first time I&#x27;m using it, I noticed something black coming off on my foot.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to apply as much pressure as compared to other similar callus removers.</li>
      <li>File section in not flat</li>

<li> The handle is not very strong.</li>
<li> I even rinsed it off and black dye just came off of it.</li>
<li> This is not worth the few dollars it costs.</li>
<li> Total waste!!!</li>
<li> I regularly use a similar type wand in the shower at least once or twice a week, and this was supposed to be a replacement, so there was no reason for it to dissolve from use, except that it was of mediocre quality.  </li>
<li> Its a waste of money.</li>
<li> Glue used on abrasive pads is no good for shower.</li>
<li> Very hard to use this way.</li>
<li> Not happy with it all.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a fairly useless plastic handle</li>
<li> Just horrible!</li>

    <li> ideal. doesn&#x27;t scratch, but does its job just right!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and a great scrub compared to others I&#x27;ve had. It is large, though, so it works best on the main problem areas. I have added a second smaller similar item to make it easier for some spots.</li>
    <li> Well made and large surface area. Texture not too light or rough, just right.</li>
    <li> Very helpfull and strong.</li>
    <li> Best one ever bigger than the rest.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Excellent quality and course enough to do anyone&#x27;s feet, no doubt. I don&#x27;t have to apply as much pressure as compared to other similar callus removers.</li>
    <li> The handles very big, but it gets the job done</li>
    <li> Great tool for the price!</li>
    <li> The handle is not very strong.</li>
    <li> I love these and will buy more. Shipped Fasstt!! and now I can better care for my feet than ever before !!</li>
    <li> Works great, but I pressed too hard and it snapped with no warning, basically hard plastic that couldn&#x27;t handle it. A wooden handled one would be a better bet.</li>
    <li> Some people complained that they left the remover in the shower to remain constantly wet and eventually it fell apart. I recommend that you dry it if it gets wet. It works perfectly and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great foot file. If it gets clogged after to many filings you can just rinse it down with water and let it dry and it&#x27;s good to go. I have not used in the shower as I read someone else didn&#x27;t advise using it. For dry feet it is great though.</li>
    <li> Does the job well!!! Its basically like using a micro pedi but instead you do the hand motion work yourself to remove callus</li>
    <li> I should have purchased a few of them due to my boyfriends rough feet.</li>
    <li> I had this sitting on a shelf in my shower (not under direct flow of water ever, just off to the side), and within about a week, all the scraping paper had peeled off.  It&#x27;s just a fairly useless plastic handle now.&lt;br /&gt;But for the first week, it did work well....</li>
    <li> very large.  need to include dimensions. other than that it functions OK.</li>
    <li> The first time I&#x27;m using it, I noticed something black coming off on my foot. I was about to really freak out when I realized that it was the surface of the scrub that was disintegrating. It literally dissolved and rubbed off completely while I&#x27;m still using it on one foot, there was nothing left on it to use on my other foot. Then instead of making my foot feel smooth, it actually made it more rough. I regularly use a similar type wand in the shower at least once or twice a week, and this was supposed to be a replacement, so there was no reason for it to dissolve from use, except that it was of mediocre quality.  I had to go back to my old wand (luckily, I hadn&#x27;t thrown it away before I got this). Then, the next day, it started peeling away from the plastic. This is not worth the few dollars it costs. Its a waste of money. Get something else.</li>
    <li> Very light and easy to pack to take on trips.  My heels need extra TLC when I&#x27;m out and about walking on a vacation.</li>
    <li> Couple of things: Item is very Large. File section in not flat it is curved. Very hard to use this way. Not happy with it all.</li>
    <li> Fell apart really quickly</li>
    <li> This file works very well; it has a convex side and a concaved side, the convex side has mild grade sandpaper and the concaved side has the course sandpaper side. The concaved side is perfect for the heel, and the convex side I like to use for the nails. .</li>
    <li> This started falling apart after two uses.  All it is is sand paper glued to a plastic stick. Total waste!!!</li>
    <li> For my calloused hands from weightlifting.  Perfect for my gym bag.</li>
    <li> Better than any that bought before. Large curved sturdy.</li>
    <li> My feet are smoother thanks to this...thanks</li>
    <li> Falls apart after brief use. Glue used on abrasive pads is no good for shower.</li>
    <li> Works good. I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy and this was just what I wanted to smooth the edges of my heels.</li>
    <li> Good product. Only problem is that I keep it in the shower and the sandpaper material on one side is starting to sag. May not have been meant to be in the shower but that&#x27;s what I was  searching for so I tried this one. So far so good. It&#x27;s been a month or so but well see.</li>
    <li> Product comes as described. Would buy again if required.</li>
    <li> This is a one use item, then it falls apart.</li>
    <li> Scrapes off all the calluses from my feet. Good to have, especially for those who wear rough footwear all the time like boots.</li>
    <li> I really like this callus remove, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get it but worth the wait.  Really does the job.</li>
    <li> Just horrible! I got this and it is cheaply made. As soon as I used it the paper started bubbling up and came off. I even rinsed it off and black dye just came off of it. That&#x27;s not normal. Anyway I just threw it away! Junk!!!!!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Paper sticker attached to plastic handle. Peeled down when I first tried to use on my foot. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
