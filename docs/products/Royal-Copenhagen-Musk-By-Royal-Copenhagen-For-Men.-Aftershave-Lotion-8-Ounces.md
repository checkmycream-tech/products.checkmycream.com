      <li>It&#x27; great, it has a smooth manly scent.</li>
      <li>I found this over forty years ago and all the women always said they liked the way it smells</li>
      <li>I like this aftershave for my husband as it&#x27;s not so strong and smells good on him.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much to be able to finally this this wonderful product and thanks as well for your wonderful service.  </li>
      <li>This price is too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>the price seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
      <li>I and my husband love Royal Copenhagen&#x27;s Musk Aftershave Lotion.  </li>
      <li>He was pleased</li>
      <li>The number one way to avoid getting ripped off when buying luxury goods is to deal with reputable businesses.</li>
      <li>I like it, but not my favorite musk.</li>
      <li>I was able to purchase this product for my husband as a Christmas gift.  </li>
      <li>I like the colonge better.  </li>
      <li>I am glad to have a source from which to buy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Always deal with reputable businesses.</li>
      <li>Craftsmanship is king for most luxury brands.</li>
      <li>Not to sweet not to spicy and most important not to strong.</li>
      <li>and I loved them until about two years ago when I noticed that the color were not as blue.  </li>
      <li>and it still holds true today.</li>
      <li>When it is not a gift and he asks for it, he is always pleased that it arrives at his door, the price is very reasonable, and it is the real product.</li>
      <li>Ladies will love it, you will love it, and it lasts all day long.  </li>
      <li>A richly scented aftershave that is not shy.</li>
      <li>Most of the other products had an odor that was just too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>If the sunglasses snap in two in the first week, or if the stitching and seams are ragged and don&#x27;t match up on a purse, the items are probably counterfeit.</li>
      <li>i have used  Royal Copenhagen products for the last 25 years or more.  </li>
      <li>I do have a suggestion for all men that are interested in this product.</li>
      <li>i feel this product is for men who desire to feel fresh after shaving without having the strong odor of the standard products.  </li>
      <li>Considering that the name is a large part of the motivation for buying a luxury brand, many manufacturers spend considerable time and energy on crafting the physical label.</li>
      <li>exactly what I was looking for my husband, the same always, ever since I first bought it 40 years ago when we got married, so thank you!</li>
      <li>A reasonably priced luxury item that will make you feel like a million bucks.</li>

      <li>Thanks Cel</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>I have been buying this aftershave from Amazon for several years, but this latest purchase is a great disappointment.</li>
      <li>So, you have us as a steady customer for this product.  </li>
      <li>I noticed right away that it didn&#x27;t even look like it used to (more green now than blue)</li>
      <li>It has a woody, old fashion scent..</li>
      <li>Different luxury brands, such as purses, have specific hardware consumers can rely on to identify a genuine piece.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many other products, Drakar Noir, Old Spice, Polo, and about any other you can think of.  </li>
      <li>If you like a unique smelling aftershave or cologne, it&#x27;s Royal Copenhagen guys, this is the scent that I get more compliments on than any other besides Geoffrey Beene, or commonly called Grey Flannel.  </li>
      <li>The exact product I expected.  </li>
      <li>For bargain-hunters looking for name-brand items at discount prices online, Better Business Bureau offers advice on avoiding web-based rip-off schemes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Females generally have a keener sense of smell than men.  </li>
      <li>But when I ordered the after shave it barely had  scent.  </li>

<li> My husband loves Royal Copenhagen Mus aftershave and it is impossible to find locally.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been buying this aftershave from Amazon for several years, but this latest purchase is a great disappointment. I noticed right away that it didn&#x27;t even look like it used to (more green now than blue) and it had almost no scent as I noticed both by sniffing the open bottle or after applying it. It just seems to have some alcohol and coloring and not much else. Very disappointing especially as I bought two 8oz bottles.</li>
    <li> I agree wholeheartedly with some of the other reviews.  I have been purchasing this product for years.  The color and scent were unfamiliar.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great aftershave. Terrific fragrance. Not to sweet not to spicy and most important not to strong. Compared to most aftershaves the price is great.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my Dad. We appreciate the chance to find it at Amazon because it is long since gone from the stores and no longer in the mainstream.  However, it is the perfect scent and gift for him. When it is not a gift and he asks for it, he is always pleased that it arrives at his door, the price is very reasonable, and it is the real product. Good purchase and good experience all around.</li>
    <li> I think writing this is like beating a dead horse.  This scent has been in my life for over 22 years!  It gets used and I reorder.  Simple.</li>
    <li> I and my husband love Royal Copenhagen&#x27;s Musk Aftershave Lotion.  However, it is getting harder and harder to find.  Thanks to Amazon I was able to purchase this product for my husband as a Christmas gift.  Thank you so much to be able to finally this this wonderful product and thanks as well for your wonderful service.  Thanks Cel</li>
    <li> For the price is a very good after shave, with a balanced fragance. The only problem in that the ink cap in contact with the liquid become sticky.</li>
    <li> I like this aftershave for my husband as it&#x27;s not so strong and smells good on him.  It has become difficult to find in our local stores but of course Amazon will carry it.  So, you have us as a steady customer for this product.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Got this for my Dad for Christmas.  He has been using it for years and this bottle seemed the same as what he has used in the past.  He was pleased and I was pleased with the price!</li>
    <li> My husband used to wear this long ago and our drugstore stopped carrying it.  I always loved the smell of it on him and thought I would try on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royal Copenhagen Musk for over 30 years now.  They used to be very good and I loved them until about two years ago when I noticed that the color were not as blue.  They seem to have greenish color, and have  different scent of smell.  Besides buying them from local stores, I had bought from several different places--such as L.A., Sacramento, and online through Amazon and I still got the same greenish in color.  These might have been diluted what is why they are cheaper.</li>
    <li> If you like a unique smelling aftershave or cologne, it&#x27;s Royal Copenhagen guys, this is the scent that I get more compliments on than any other besides Geoffrey Beene, or commonly called Grey Flannel.  Ladies will love it, you will love it, and it lasts all day long.  great scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He loves this stuff, would bath in it if he could. Perfect for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Your vender was excellent to work with and the product was just what I asked for...</li>
    <li> I send in a response once.  That should be enough.  I have used this product for several years and enjoy it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Royal Copenhagen Mus aftershave and it is impossible to find locally. I am glad to have a source from which to buy.</li>
    <li> The exact product I expected.  The Musk cologne which came from another vendor was not. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> A richly scented aftershave that is not shy. Feels good on the skin. A reasonably priced luxury item that will make you feel like a million bucks.</li>

The number one way to avoid getting ripped off when buying luxury goods is to deal with reputable businesses. When in doubt, shoppers can contact the manufacturer and verify which venders are authorized sellers. Consumers should also check out the business with BBB before making a purchasing decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. One of the biggest red flags for knock-off merchandise is an unrealistic price. Extremely low prices are tempting but not to be believed. Paying $100 for a $1000 purse could result in the consumer receiving a poorly constructed - and worthless - fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read between the lines. Some websites or online classified ads will go overboard in their description of the item in order to coax the buyer&#x27;s trust. Overuse of &amp;#34;genuine,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; is a bad sign. Buyers also need to keep an eye out for sneaky phrases like &amp;#34;inspired by.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the merchandise. Considering that the name is a large part of the motivation for buying a luxury brand, many manufacturers spend considerable time and energy on crafting the physical label.

Different luxury brands, such as purses, have specific hardware consumers can rely on to identify a genuine piece. Zippers, screws, clasps and stitching are usually very specific for the brand and the manufacturer often has details on their website explaining what to look for and how to spot a knock-off. Craftsmanship is king for most luxury brands. If the sunglasses snap in two in the first week, or if the stitching and seams are ragged and don&#x27;t match up on a purse, the items are probably counterfeit.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for my husband, the same always, ever since I first bought it 40 years ago when we got married, so thank you!</li>
    <li> This is quite a good product.  i feel this product is for men who desire to feel fresh after shaving without having the strong odor of the standard products.  i have used  Royal Copenhagen products for the last 25 years or more.  I have tried so many other products, Drakar Noir, Old Spice, Polo, and about any other you can think of.  Most of the other products had an odor that was just too strong for me.  Females generally have a keener sense of smell than men.  I constantly receive compliments from them about this product.  I do have a suggestion for all men that are interested in this product. Purchase the colonge and use it instead of the aftershave.  I like the colonge better.  i give the colonge 5 stars.  You will like this product.</li>
    <li> I found this over forty years ago and all the women always said they liked the way it smells and it still holds true today.</li>
    <li> It has a woody, old fashion scent..Hard to describe..I like it, but not my favorite musk. Just my preference in aftershave</li>
    <li> Have been using this cologne/after shave for over 30 years.  Have ordered the cologne before with good results.  But when I ordered the after shave it barely had  scent.  It was watered down.  I had a previous bottle of after shave left from before and compared the smell and there was no comparison.  My previous bottle of after shave had plenty of scent but the new bottle had very little smell.  When I went to return it they said I could not.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion...do not order anything from this company again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27; great, it has a smooth manly scent.</li>
