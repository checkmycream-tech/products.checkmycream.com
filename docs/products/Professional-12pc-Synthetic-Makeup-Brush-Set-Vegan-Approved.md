      <li>Very face friendly.</li>
      <li>The brushes kit looks like a small clutch and the brushes are great.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The brushes look nice and work well and even came a day early. I haven&#x27;t had any unwanted bristles on my face from using them, which is great, but after only a couple weeks, the silver part detached from the wood on a couple of brushes. This is really easily fixed, but shows that you get what you pay for. So these are an okay buy for the buck.</li>
    <li> The fact that these were vegan really had no baring on whether or not I bought them, I got them based on the reviews and I&#x27;m glad that I did. These brushes are super soft, and really high quality, especially for the price. The carrying case is nice and well made. I don&#x27;t do makeup all that often, but these will be nice to use on the nights when I wanna look pretty.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. She was pleased, but not elated.  Fairly good quality.</li>
    <li> Its a beautiful packing and the brushes are of great use.Over all a very good product with reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I thought the hairs would fluff out after a few washes, but they dry to look the same way as they did when I originally got them. These brushes seem to be better for powder foundations, blushes, and eyeshadows though. I&#x27;ll stick to my older sets to get liquid looking flawless. Overall, it&#x27;s a very good set for the price.</li>
    <li> Typically , I am very picky when it comes to the brushes I use  BUT this set caught my eye and I went ahead and purchased it . I have since tried the brushes and I have to say , they are awesome.  I tried almost every brush so far and each one works just as it should ....Plus, the leather look case folds to look like a large wallet and there is a protective cover for over the brushes .. For the price , you really can&#x27;t beat this brush set..I am really considering ordering 2 more  to use as gifts ...I would most definitely recommend this to friends</li>
    <li> This is like a professional make up brush set.  Excellent quality and very fast service.  Gave one to my daughter-in-law and she was delighted too.</li>
    <li> shocked by other good reviews.     these brushes are adequate.     a lot of the larger brushes are too strong and a lot of the smaller brushes are too flimsy. i&#x27;d prefer a brush that gave a more diffuse application of blushes and powder.    the fan/bronzer brush is very flimsy and almost useless as well.</li>
    <li> These r the best brushes I have bought so far. No shedding even after deep clean.very thick worth every dollar love them</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful and they feel great for being made of synthetic hair. However, I feel that the thickness of the facial (blush, all-lover, concealer) is lacking. They are too thin to really get a good makeup coverage on my face. There isn&#x27;t enough hair on the brush to get good use out of them. And the eye brushes work well and are great. If you are looking for quality brushes and/or it&#x27;s your first brush set, I would recommend looking at other sets. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I put these brushes on my wishlist &amp; my brother gave them to me for xmas, they are amazing! I&#x27;ve used very expensive and very cheap brushes and these are among the least expensive yet feel just as luxurious and work just as well, if not better, as MAC &amp; Trish Mcevoy, etc. You may need one more \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; eyeshadow brush in addition to these because they are all on the flat side. Other than that, I love them! The case is also cute and practical.</li>
    <li> Those brushes are of good quality, they maintain shape very well. Only thing i don&#x27;t like is that the set don&#x27;t have round blender brush.   Otherwise good quality set for the money.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the variety of sizes &amp; the types of brushes. Was a pleasure doing business with them again</li>
    <li> The makeup brushes arrived very quickly (even considering the holiday season) and were just as described.  They appeared durable and well-made, but I am not sure about performance as they were a gift.  I would definitely consider purchasing from the same retailer again.  Overall, a good makeup brush set at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> loved the set i had bought for myself, and had to buy another for my sister. This brush set is a good price but of even better quality. Would be perfect if they came with matching powder brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality and I love the carrying case.  I use them every single day.  The variety is really fantastic, especially with the eyeshadow brushes.  They didn&#x27;t smell weird, and they are very easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed.  The only critique I have is that the blush brushes are all the same and I would have liked a fluffier, larger one.  Other than that, for the price these are AMAZING. And they&#x27;re vegan :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing and you will NOT regret buying them! It is super soft and amazing quality. Shipping was fairly speedy and I am highly pleased with these brushes. They are definitely something worth paying for.</li>
    <li> I understand that companies want to put \\&quot;Vegan\\&quot; on any product that isn&#x27;t animal based or refined with animal oils and such. Synthetic brushes are great to use, but they work best with cream cosmetics; cream liners, shadows, bases, etc. It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t use them but when blending, using the non-mammal versions will not do the trick with powder cosmetics; as these types of brushes will move powders around but will also take away the product and hence keep you from blending it well to the desired effect.    Powder cosmetics need natural bristles ..as the bristles hold the powder better and the same goes for the cream ..the natural brushes will react in a clump like way due to the oils in the cream, hence the synthetic brushes will give a smoother result. Overall, these are great brushes for anyone who applies makeup often enough to invest in.</li>
    <li> Nice Make up brush set........Professional 12pc Synthetic Makeup Brush Set Vegan Approved.......nice sizes lots of variety....well made...They would make a nice gift!~</li>
    <li> The first time i recived this brush my first impression is how come the brush cover is big and i was a second thougth to returned it because the brush is too flat, handle is too long and it is very annoying while holding the coz of the handle, and there is no signature ingraved on it who made., this brush its look like an Oil Painting Brush that&#x27;s why its look cheaper..! But anyway i can the difference after im using it because of the way how the bristle is good to apply for in face very blend well to used it anykind of make up...so anyway im happy to bougth this set of brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes have withstood quite a few cleanings. The make up goes on smoothly with these and they are very soft. Recommend them for beginners if you&#x27;ve never used brushes before.</li>
    <li> These brushes are synthetic but feel every bit as soft and luxurious as animal-derived bristles.  A great range of sizes and shapes are included, and the carrying case is stylish and hassle-free.  The lip brushes aren&#x27;t as stiff as I expected, and you&#x27;ll need to add a few larger brushes (blush, kabuki) to your arsenal, but overall this is a great starter kit or set of brushes to travel with.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes they were the softest thing in this world that I&#x27;ve ever touched aside from a chinchilla, or however you spell that.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my girl, and she loved it.  Quality is really good, and once I saw how much I would have had to pay for buying brushes individually I realized it was a great deal ($34).  Oh, and it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
    <li> I bought both of these as Christmas gifts.  They look very nice, have soft bristles and I think the recipients will enjoy them.</li>
    <li> And there are very few brushes for your eyelids.  They are all small and there is no blending brush or an angled brush.  This set is really worthless.  Also, the blush and powder brush don&#x27;t cover any surface and are very skinny and stiff.  They will leave harsh lines instead of the nice coverage one needs for that sort of make up.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for the price, couldn&#x27;t beat it, and so glad I did.  They are very very soft and very comfy.  They say that real hair makeup brushes, not synthetic, is better for powdered (dry) make up items. Synthetic works on better on cremes (wet).  I have both types of makeup and now both types of brushes.  I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes yet, but on the ones I have, Grade A thumbs up from me.  You do not have to use these for cremes only, you can use powders also.  As I said very nice set.  Would be a nice gift, as a starter set, especially for those just starting on wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. The hairs don&#x27;t shed. The brushed are well-shaped, nicely weighted, and feel good in my hand. There is a brush for just about every application. Although they are vegan, the hairs don&#x27;t feel synthetic. They are soft and tapered like real hair. Makeup goes on very smooth, soft and clean. The case is very handy. It keeps my brushes well-organized, clean, and safe. This is the best brush set I have ever owned. Because it is so inexpensive, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a wise purchase, but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The shipping was fast and arrived three days before Amazon told me it would. Handling in the shipping was amazing. The product was so wrapped up like a fragile object. The brushes kit looks like a small clutch and the brushes are great. Love it and will definitely buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes. Never a bristle left on your face to pick off. They feel so soft. Luxury all the way!</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had so far. There&#x27;s no shedding the brush hairs stay on well. Great quality that will last a long time. These brushes are more than you can ask for especially for the price! This is a great buy! Highly reccommend others to buy!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of professional-quality brushes. There are 12 pcs of varying sizes, thickness and angles. The eyebrow brush and eye makeup applicators are particlarly nice. The bristles are extremely soft, but firm, and make for nice application (softer than even non-synthetics I&#x27;ve owned previously). The bristles do not fall out. The faux-leather pouch/case is also nice. My only complaints are that the powder brush and the blusher brush are too flat and the blusher brush is not thick enough (they are not fluffy or wider like you would normally expect a powder and blusher brush would be). I have adapted and altered my application to accommodate for now, but I may need to purchase an additional powder (kabuki-type) brush which I prefer to supplement this purchase.</li>
    <li> I received them on time, and in perfect condition. The faux leather case is obviously fake, but nice and dose the job, and doesn&#x27;t have that nasty smell real leather has! The brushes look very attractive, they come covered in there own individual plastic wrapping. The brushes are soft, but have a stiffness that I thought would go away after I washed them, but didn&#x27;t. The eye brushes work very well, good with applying and blending, they pick color up very well with very little wast of powder! I do use the big brushes for blush, and bronzing, but for my mineral powder foundation I use a brand name real hair brush! The lip application brush work well, along with the eye liner brush, and all brushes wash very well, and don&#x27;t shed! All in all a good buy for a vegan friendly product!</li>
    <li> Very face friendly. It has really soft brush ends and products rarely seeps in the brush. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s easier to clean!</li>
    <li> These brushes r awesome on the eyes! I have used them almost a week and I love how much detail I can put into my make up and the quality is amazing. There r so many different sizes which makes doing my make up fun! The bristles don&#x27;t fall out either. Huge plus in my book. ;)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and she loves it. Recommends it to anyone else. Can&#x27;t think of anything else thug life</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these brushes! They are beautiful and the case they come in is beautiful as well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the big powder brushes are very flat, not rounded and do not give an even application. There is only two brushes like that, the rest are great.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what i wanted the brushes are full sized not travel sized and are super nice. The case is a nice size and even has an extra pocket for another brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this vegan brush set. I only use vegan brushes, and I use this brush set every day. The fan brush did come bent, which was a bummer, but it arrived in good time. Very rarely do I find a stray bristle on my face. Overall, it is a great buy for its price and exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it. The wallet is well made and it holds the brushes nicely.  The brushes are also very well made and of course, my wife is super happy with her new brushes.</li>
    <li> the item was very nice small not what i expected i would think it was little bigger but i&#x27;m not complaining I  like it I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> and there vegan! awesome quality! i cant wait to put my makeup on. im looking soooo professional now. thank you</li>
    <li> Works swell, no problems at all. Hairs do not fall out. Good variety of sizes. Nice natural look, not too &amp;#34;material mac girl&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I did not like these brushes and gave them away.  The tip popped right off during use with one, and the brushes are stiff and don&#x27;t work so great for application.</li>
