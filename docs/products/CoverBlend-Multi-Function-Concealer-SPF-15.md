      <li>This is the absolute best concealer!  </li>

      <li>Lasts all day, nice finish.</li>
      <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t rub off easily like cheap oil based products...powder sets this beautifully.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best one around!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many concealers but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I really love how well it blends into the skin</li>
      <li>Maybe the coverage is better if I had gotten a darker color?</li>
      <li>I use my fingers so you might have better results with a sponge or brush.  </li>
      <li>I can even swim and most of the stuff will stay on.</li>
      <li>I recapped it, and shook the tube, and squished it around and shook some more - but it still sounded like liquid.</li>
      <li>I love that it has spf, as any sun exposure darkens these spots.  </li>
      <li>Hey I love this stuff...</li>
      <li>This was my favorite concealer for years and years.</li>
      <li>The color matches my light skin nicely.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>: Confirmed!</li>
      <li>I love this cover up.  </li>
      <li>seems more like a foundation rather than a concealer.</li>
      <li>She really thought it looked great.</li>
      <li>I would love to give this 5 stars</li>
      <li>But it makes me hesitant to buy any more.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>You can layer it if more is needed.</li>
      <li>which is M A C pro longwear concealer, which works much better.  </li>
      <li>She is very fair and its the only concealer that works for her.</li>
      <li>After using it, I am going to do what many others do and purchase Beige in addition to Light</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this concealer!</li>
      <li>When I first put it on, I was so pleased!  </li>
      <li>Avon&#x27;s nothing covers as well or as easily as CoverBlend.  </li>
      <li>*easy to apply by hand   </li>
      <li>All of those tubes were fine.</li>
      <li>I have been using this in the light shade for about 7 months and its still almost full.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Concealer SPF 15 Light has NONE of those problems.</li>
      <li>I have to say this is a mighty working product to use with the issues I am having.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t set into wrinkles around your eyes..</li>
      <li>Once I finally gained control of the stuff and got it onto my face, the coverage wasn&#x27;t great, either.</li>
      <li>I ordered it in light</li>
      <li>I smooth concealer on my undereyes</li>
      <li>every day ( i tend to get a purpley blue tint - i am very fair) and this one doesn&#x27;t seem to cover it very well.  </li>
      <li>I bought another tube and it was thick and perfect.</li>
      <li>I was able to use the whole tube, but I had to shake it vigorously each time to re-mix the makeup with the liquid.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very cakey and do not cover blemishes more then</li>
      <li>It comes in different shades and they are good for everyone.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>I have a rather fair complexion, so much as to give a new difinition for the term, \\&quot;fair-skinned.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>be sure and apply this is multiple light layers!</li>
      <li>Yet it covers everything perfectly and you hardly have to use any!</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I wanted to try something different from my normal Neutrogena Skin Clearing concealer, and it had great reviews.</li>
      <li>This is a big reason why I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I had used this brand before and LOVED it, but for some reason the slight change in color (medium to light) changed how well the product maintained its blend.</li>
      <li>This concealer is great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Its long-lasting throughout the day and is the only product which has effectively concealed the darker pigmentation.</li>
      <li>great for the price, it has lots of concealer in a small tube.</li>
      <li>I have used every kind of concealer around from low to VERY high end products.</li>
      <li>When I first squeezed it I lost a bunch of it right out of the tube....</li>
      <li>Not my Favorite product, while it did cover the area I noticed it seems more to just smear and smudge and just felt heavy all over...</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, looks natural, and lasts.</li>
      <li>It did feel light and comfortable on my skin, but that is definitely not enough for me to buy this again.</li>
      <li>*about 15-20 dollars per tube, but lasts me about 3-4 weeks per tube which I think is very reasonable</li>
      <li>Plus, if I would get a issue with a blemish I am sure this would cover that up with no problem if it covers my huge dark circles up.</li>
      <li>I have used this stuff religiously for many years and now it is all liquid.  </li>
      <li>When I first opened it a bunch of water drained out.</li>
      <li>I used about four or five of those dots and was able to complete transfix my complexion to NORMAL.</li>
      <li>A pea size does my whole face!</li>
      <li>It covers really well!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As the title says, anytime I try to get some out of the tube, it squirts out as basically water with some concealer hidden inside. I bought two and both are the same way so it&#x27;s not just one defective tube. It&#x27;s unusable. I got suckered into paying a lot for this garbage because of the reviews. Do yourself a favor: ignore all of the high reviews, because they&#x27;re NOT accurate and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff religiously for many years and now it is all liquid.  When I first squeezed it I lost a bunch of it right out of the tube.... Shot on my clothes,  all over the place!. I am so disappointed... And such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is great concealer. After using it, I am going to do what many others do and purchase Beige in addition to Light so I can mix them. I have reasonably fair skin and Light is -very- light, probably best for winter. So if I mix in Beige, it should match. Apply only a tiny bit--I use a concealer brush, then apply foundation to the rest of my face and brush that in over the concealer.  It STAYS--no creasing, no irritation, nice and &#x27;slippery&#x27; vs. cakey. By combining Light and Beige, along with having to apply very little, this should last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> I really like this concealer. It covers better than any other I&#x27;ve ever tried and stays on until I wash it off. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it does tend to get a bit cakey. I primarily got it for dark under eye circles. Be careful to put it on in light, thin layers around the eye area. I have a small scar on my cheek and this covers it completely. A little bit goes a long way, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and cannot imagine ever being without it. I have terrible dark circles under my eyes and the difference after applying this product is remarkable. I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the high ratings of this product and especially how people seems to like that it provides very nice coverage. To me it&#x27;s consistancy and coverage seems more like a foundation rather than a concealer. I have a hard time covering my dark circles or pimples. I ordered it in light so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a problem with this particular color. Maybe the coverage is better if I had gotten a darker color?</li>
    <li> I ordered this a while ago so I had one when my current tube ran out. I never expected that tube to last this long. I have been using product for a few years - it has been the best for covering up my dark circles w/o looking too heavy. However, when I opened this tube the concealer was very runny. I recapped it, and shook the tube, and squished it around and shook some more - but it still sounded like liquid. It did thicken up a LITTLE, but not what it should be, and not really the right color, either - darker than usual.  It did cross my mind that perhaps it had sat too long, but I do not think that is the case. I used to buy this at a local drug store, but they discontinued it a couple years ago. I bought 3 tubes at the time.  I did wonder about whether it was a good idea, since they would obviously be sitting a while until I got to use it all, but since it was half price I figured, what the heck. All of those tubes were fine. I have purchased the concealer online since then and it has gone well - until now.  Of course, now I&#x27;ve had this so long I&#x27;m not sure I can do anything about it. But it makes me hesitant to buy any more.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is a mighty working product to use with the issues I am having. With it providing coverage to skin imperfections such as age spots, acne scars, dark under eye circles and blemishes this is truly amazing cover up item to use. I really love how well it blends into the skin and it isn&#x27;t heavy. Plus it covers up really well with my dark circles it can truly hide them for me. Plus, if I would get a issue with a blemish I am sure this would cover that up with no problem if it covers my huge dark circles up.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed....too pricey... Don&#x27;t purchase.......waste of money...would ask for my money returned..misplaced carton,,,,&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to be so negative&lt;br /&gt;Debra in Santa Monica</li>
    <li> be sure and apply this is multiple light layers! It is the best I have ever purchased/used (here or anywhere). I purchased two-1 light and 1 beige due to past experience, light is usually too light and beige is to dark. Put em together and perfection.</li>
    <li> Covers almost everything.When I use it on undereye shadows,need to moisturize area first to avoid cracking.Otherwise,excellent.This is my second tube and I use it every day.Shipper got it to me within just a few days,too.</li>
    <li> I love this cover up.  I&#x27;m very fair but do tan easily so I can alway get the right shade just by mixing a little of the medium with my normal fair.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, Bare Minerals, Avon&#x27;s nothing covers as well or as easily as CoverBlend.  I&#x27;m fair with a sometimes ruddy complexion but you would never know it thank to this coverup!  People always tell me I have beautiful skin.  This is my little secret!</li>
    <li> Nice purse size concealer/makeup.  Good coverage.</li>
    <li> I have a rather fair complexion, so much as to give a new difinition for the term, \\&quot;fair-skinned.\\&quot; Along with my fair-skin comes the infamous, DARK CIRCLES under my eyes. Since my a teen I have been trying different products to hide those hideous dark circles. I&#x27;ve used powders, creams, gels, lotions, anything and everything from low cost to high. I was never really satisfied with a product; didn&#x27;t stay on long enough, felt oily, and the most common reason, the cracking/caking look. I went on the hunt, yet again, to see if I could fulfill my quest at finding a workable product for my unsightly circles and decided to give CoverBlend a try. I dabbed a little on and was complete amazed at how little I had to use. When I say dabbed on, I even mean small dots about the size of the end of a pencil. I used about four or five of those dots and was able to complete transfix my complexion to NORMAL. I asked my husband what he thought, and thought it looked good. I am a nurse and don&#x27;t want my co-workers thinking I am fatigued or anemic, so I definately try to hide my dark circles. I told a co-worker I was wearing a new concealer and asked her to tell me what she thought, as she&#x27;s seen my circles at their darkest, when my other make-ups fade off. She really thought it looked great. I have had it on for my 12 1/2 hour shift and my dark circles are STILL HIDDEN !!! That is some feat since I run up and down hallways, caring for patients. I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT!!! I have actually found a product that works for me. If you&#x27;ve had as many troubles as I have, try this product !!</li>
    <li> Not my Favorite product, while it did cover the area I noticed it seems more to just smear and smudge and just felt heavy all over... it looked weird on me so I kept on taking it off not really what you want to have to do with a concealer all day long.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff.  i&#x27;ve gone through several tubes for my dark circles.  great for the price, it has lots of concealer in a small tube.</li>
    <li> This concealer is great for everyday use. I bought it because it does not contain anything I&#x27;m allergic to. It gives good coverage and a little goes a long way. The color matches my light skin nicely.</li>
    <li> Hey I love this stuff... I bought it unseen based upon reviews because I was terribly desparate to find an acceptable replacement for my phenomenal private salon brand concealor. That product was unbelievable and lasted forever but cost 85 bucks a pop!!!! This turned out to be almost as good...it isn&#x27;t as thick as my original product, but it was much less draggy to apply. It covers much better than all store bought products ive encountered and the big bonus is that it diminishes the appearance of dark spots when u keep applying it to an area...like acne scars... and it doesn&#x27;t flare up my acne. Also it doesn&#x27;t rub off easily like cheap oil based products...powder sets this beautifully. I have been using this in the light shade for about 7 months and its still almost full.&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day...I used it on her black eye that she got from an overenthusiastic toddler and she was really impressed and asked to have her undereyes touched up as well as an age spot... needless to say she wanted to take this stuff home. Now she will have her own and I will continue to purchase this product for us both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on my shipping...I checked on amazon the day my product was estimated to arrive and the status showed it had been delivered several days earlier. This was not the case and clearly was a problem having to do with my postal service... I emailed the seller and the next day they sent out a replacement which I got before mother&#x27;s day-thankfully-and it was sent registered mail this time. I feel bad that the postal service caused them to lose product and money, but it should work out in the long run because I&#x27;ll continue to order from them due to their great service and quality skin care items! Great customer service, guys!</li>
    <li> If I could give this a negative star I would.  The product is not the same as the one I bought from ulta.  The concealer came out as water.  I shook it up and it is water mixed with runny gross concealer.  I unfortunately did not open this product until it was too late to return.  I am very disappointed in the seller anyhow.  This product was either a bait and switch or beyond expired.  I will never order make-up from this seller and I suggest you don&#x27;t either.  When I bought this concealer from Ulta it was creamy and had a nice even cover.  This was a waste of $22!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for apx. 2 years now and have always been very please with it.</li>
    <li> Love it. If you have trouble with under eye circles, this will cover them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;s have sensitive skin and it caused no irritation, but the product became cake-y after a few hours so that only a very tinny bit could be used to prevent it. I had used this brand before and LOVED it, but for some reason the slight change in color (medium to light) changed how well the product maintained its blend.</li>
    <li> great heavy coverage - long wearing and high sunscreen properties.  A life saver when you have troubled skin like mine.</li>
    <li> Does a great job concealing blemishes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and am very please.  I have tried many other products over the years but none have worked as well as CoverBlend.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer!  Easy to apply, looks natural, and lasts.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product two years ago. I&#x27;ve been buying it now since and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works for me.  What a lifesaver!  The tube lasts me a year.  If you are self-conscious about dark circles, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I was very anxious to try this concealer.  When I first put it on, I was so pleased!  It really seemed to cover well.  But, within a few hours, I could see a lot of dry lines under my eyes that had never been noticeable before.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using CoverBlend for years. This is the only brand I purchase. I have super sensitive skin, but have had no issues. Great product!  It covers very well.</li>
    <li> The concealer was old and oily poor  mixture quality . ive bought it before and it was perfect. very disappointed this timme:(</li>
    <li> Have been using this as a light concealer for a few years and do not go anywhere without it!  PROS:  *easy to bring during travel, vacations due to small size  *waterproof, can swim, goto beach, sweat, etc and will not smudge off or be noticeable at all. This is a big reason why I love this product!  *easy to apply by hand   *small tube lasts a long, long time and multiple tubes can be stored for long time  *natural looking and basically unobtrusive, people will not even know you are using it  CONS:  *about 15-20 dollars per tube, but lasts me about 3-4 weeks per tube which I think is very reasonable</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best of its kind! I was born with very pasty, thin skin. As a result, I have always had what is referred to as \\&quot;hollow eye syndrome,\\&quot; which in other words simply means that I have permanent, very dark purple-blue dark circles under my eyes. Since I was only about 12, I have been trying every so-called \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; imaginable to man, but everything out there was either not thick enough, too orange, cracked and creased within hours (and I had to reapply it), or came right off when my eyes watered, or when I went swimming. CoverBlend Multi-Function Concealer SPF 15 Light has NONE of those problems. None. Ever since I found this product in a CVS years ago (no longer sold in any stores I can find), it is the only product I have been buying to cover my very deep dark circles as well as my acne and of course mild blemishes as well. I now look like a normal person. I can even swim and most of the stuff will stay on. It stays on all day and I can put as little or as much on to increase or decrease the opacity. It&#x27;s smooth and easy to blend with your finger, and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or anything weird looking like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even crease when I laugh hard like every other concealer I&#x27;ve tried. It even beats the horribly expensive stuff. Also something to note: in photographs, it does NOT reflect strangely light-colored like Merle Normal Cover Up and a few others. It makes you look NORMAL, like you aren&#x27;t wearing makeup. That&#x27;s the bottom line! It does EVERYTHING THAT A CONCEALER SHOULD!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can possibly think of as something that might bother people is that initially, it might feel odd under your eyes, depending on how much you apply. When I go a day without wearing it, I actually feel naked. It&#x27;s a little odd to describe, but it doesn&#x27;t feel gunky or thick on your face, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NOTHING like this stuff anywhere, and believe me, I have looked EVERYWHERE and tried EVERYTHING. If you have severe dark circles or minimal dark circles, minor blemishes or deep scars, this is an absolute MUST HAVE!have severe dark circles or minimal dark circles, minor blemishes or deep scars, this is an absolute MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> As per all the glowing reviews on this product I really wanted to like it and it&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not great.  I smooth concealer on my undereyes every day ( i tend to get a purpley blue tint - i am very fair) and this one doesn&#x27;t seem to cover it very well.  I use my fingers so you might have better results with a sponge or brush.  The tube is large and would easily last anyone a long time.  I always require a lot of layers in order to get coverage.  I didn&#x27;t finish out the tube and switched to another product instead- which is M A C pro longwear concealer, which works much better.  Too bad I have so much unused product leftover :(</li>
    <li> Based off other&#x27;s reviews, I&#x27;m assuming I just got a bad tube, but this concealer is extremely watery. This would therefore be a review about the seller and not the product itself--I&#x27;m going to give the product a benefit of a doubt here, since I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s supposed to be a creamy consistency. Basically what happened is I uncapped the tube and slightly squeezed on the container when a stream of watered-down concealer came gushing out. Needless to say, I am NOT pleased and am extremely pissed that I spent $20 on a defective tube of concealer. I literally cannot use it, because the concealer gets all over my hands and desk whenever I try to squeeze out the product. I even shook the tube and heard everything swishing around inside. What the hell??</li>
    <li> Bought this to disguise redness occurring with rosacea.  It does a good job when used over a moisturizer and primer covering the redness but not cracking. Recommend using it with a primer and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is very cakey and do not cover blemishes more then my regular make up.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves streaks which looks really unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;I also find it hard to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many concealers but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found. It covers everything and without being too heavy and it lasts for hours.  It comes in different shades and they are good for everyone. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 5 years, and it was great, but when I ordered here it was like a&lt;br /&gt;Water and did not cover at all.  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> This product works great at covering dark spots on my face which I developed during pregnancy.  I tried expensive bleaching cream and paid for many dermatology visits to no avail until I found this great little tube.  Its long-lasting throughout the day and is the only product which has effectively concealed the darker pigmentation. I love that it has spf, as any sun exposure darkens these spots.  The price point is affordable. Only a little is needed, so it lasts forever.  I keep thinking my tube is almost out, but it continues to give me the few drops I need (for months:)  It gives me confidence and I love that if I have a picture taken, I can&#x27;t see the dark spots across my face!! Very happy with the purchase and will get again!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product after getting a sample by mail with another product I ordered. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this concealer! ITS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! I have used every kind of concealer around from low to VERY high end products. This is by far the best one around!! It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t set into wrinkles around your eyes.. Yet it covers everything perfectly and you hardly have to use any! I not only use this to cover up blemishes but I also use this for my all over foundation. Like I said before you only have to use a small amount. A pea size does my whole face! It does have different shades but I feel like it blends in so well and almost changes to your personal skin tone. Will never stop using this! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me.  It lasts a long time even though it&#x27;s in a little tube.  It covers those awful dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have been using the brand of concealer for years-it really is the best one out there that I have found.</li>
    <li> I would love to give this 5 stars but I think I got a bad batch. In the tube I received, the makeup was separated from the liquid. When I first opened it a bunch of water drained out. I had never used the product before, so I assumed it was always like this. I was able to use the whole tube, but I had to shake it vigorously each time to re-mix the makeup with the liquid. It was inconvenient but I like it enough, even with the separation issue, that I&#x27;m coming back to buy another bottle. It covers really well!  12/22/2015: Confirmed! I bought another tube and it was thick and perfect. The first tube I got must have been really old.</li>
    <li> This does provide a good heavy coverage but it makes my under eyes look very crepey &amp; old.... I&#x27;m only in in my 40&#x27;s but this makes my eyes look ancient....</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re concerned about the price, I&#x27;ve had this same tube of concealer for close to 10 years. It is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used. I also started using it to cover under eye circles. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Covers well but still lightweight, dries matte but not cakey. Lasts all day, nice finish. You can layer it if more is needed.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best concealer!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have hyperpigmentation &amp; have not found anything that covers completely - this does a very good job, is east to apply and blend.  I am very fair and got the lightest shade.</li>
    <li> My daughter is hooked on this concealer.  She is very fair and its the only concealer that works for her.</li>
    <li> I found the product runny, almost like a watery clear liquid when I first squeezed some out of the tube.  Finally, after quite a bit of the clear liquid came out a small amount of color appeared.  I managed to put this on the spot on my face that I wanted to cover and it left a huge smear on my face that was very difficult to smooth in.  I don&#x27;t care for this product at all and certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend if to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to try something different from my normal Neutrogena Skin Clearing concealer, and it had great reviews. Boy, was I disappointed. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective batch or what, but this stuff was so thin and drippy that I could barely use it. I managed to stain a pair of black pants because a drop of it fell on them - after 2 washes it has not come out. The concealer also wouldn&#x27;t stay mixed - the liquid appeared to have separated, and no amount of shaking seemed to emulsify it. It was very difficult to get an appropriate amount to come out of the bottle - it kept gushing out with the slightest bit of tube squeezing. Once I finally gained control of the stuff and got it onto my face, the coverage wasn&#x27;t great, either. It did feel light and comfortable on my skin, but that is definitely not enough for me to buy this again. Back to Neutrogena I go!</li>
    <li> Received my umpteenth tube of this stuff and it was like water.  Had to shake for several minutes to get it frothy enough to not GUSH out of the tube.  Looks like I painted my face with chalk after using. Sooooo disappointed.  This was my favorite concealer for years and years. Never again.</li>
