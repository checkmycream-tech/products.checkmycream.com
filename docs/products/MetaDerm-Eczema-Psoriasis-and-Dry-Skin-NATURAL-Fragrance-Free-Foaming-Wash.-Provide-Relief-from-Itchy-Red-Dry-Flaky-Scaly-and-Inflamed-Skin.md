<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ok cleanser very mild but small container for the price</li>
    <li> I get a winter eczema and this is the only thing I wash my hands with, helps alot</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I was disappointed soap was like water</li>
    <li> This products gives me clean, soft skin and helps soften my psoriasis.  I recommend using it with the Metaderm Organic Psorasis Moisturizing cream.  I have suffered with psoriasis for 40 years and have spent a fortune on every conceivable treatment out there.  These two products have done more in 2 weeks then any of the chemical based treatments with no ugly side effects.  I have only been using this for 2 weeks, and look forward to seeing what it can do in the coming months!</li>
    <li> My husband has psoriasis and had a bad case this winter.  I ordered this after seeing it online on either WEB MD or Mayo Clinic.  He was using a prescription salve from the Doctor.  We did a test and one arm he used the metaderm and the other the salve from the dr.  He washed both arms with the MetaDerm soap.  He used the MetaDerm Organic Psoriasis Moisturizing cream also.  Great results.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful stuff - no residue- really cleans- easy to use- keeps my skin in better shape- helps control the ezema along with lotion.</li>
    <li> Very good feel, not drying, softening and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is a great moisturizer!! I am not sure it is helping my seborrehic dermatitis!! It will take more time to asses that!!</li>
    <li> leaves an annoying medicinal odor on skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff.  These were my 2nd purchase in a month; wanted some for my sink-side for night/morning face washing.  I have PROBLEM skin &amp; have had my entire life.  Either it&#x27;s breaking out with acne or as dry as the desert, or both at the same time.  I&#x27;ve tried the usual non-allergenic options -- Neutrogena, aveeno, cetaphil, etc., but they either fixed only one of my problems and/or increased my other problem.  Metaderm controls both well.  My skin is clearer while not being overly dry or oily.  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I have bad flare ups of eczema occasionally. I avoided washing my hands as often as I should because the soaps would make the eczema worse. Often I just quickly rinsed them. Not now. My purchase was a set of two bottles. One for home and one for work. The soap works very well and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out. In fact, I still use this soap without an eczema flare up. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Seemed to make it worse for me</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my sensitive eczema, very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is perfect for my dry skin.  It also helps to calm eczema and small psoriatic plaques with continued use. Everything helps in my case!</li>
    <li> I do not like this product at all.  It worsened my skin condition.  False claims made in reviews.  I now cannot believe all the positive reviews I read.  Must have been written by people from within the company.  I am going to request a refund for all the Metaderm products I purchased.</li>
    <li> Finally...a product which works. Cleans without irritation AND helps the skin to heal.</li>
    <li> This hand soap is amazing! I have psoriasis and sometimes get an outbreak on my fingers and it helped clear it right up. It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Amazing relief of the dry flaky skin. Would recommend this product A+</li>
    <li> I bought the full line of MetaDerm products including the foaming cleanser, cream and spray. I was really hoping to find something non-steroidal that would work for me. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products from other brands such as Aveeno, Cetaphil, Goldbond, Vaseline, etc. Sadly, this product is not for me, but the company will give you a full refund if you aren&#x27;t satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial feel of the product is pleasant, and quickly makes any present itch disappear. However, as the day goes on, even after reapplying the product, my skin would feel very dry, tight and irritated. I would feel the urge to flush the skin with lots of water (and I could feel the product washing off) and then reapply a moisturizer. After about a month, I couldn&#x27;t stand the products anymore and went back to my old moisturizer and non-soap cleanser which returned my skin back to square one. I figure I must be allergic to one or more of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Have only used for a couple of weeks so far but seeing a big difference already.</li>
    <li> The soap is light and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or that harsh feeling like some products do. It&#x27;s makes it easier to use since it&#x27;s in a easy pump dispenser. I wash my baby entire body from head to toe with this and have no issues with soap in the eyes. Great product overall, great customer service as well.</li>
    <li> Great for those who wash their hand frequently, and those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It&#x27;s gentle &amp; makes a lovely, light foam that does not seem to dry my skin as it cleanses.</li>
    <li> Very gentle.  I do have one tiny gripe: the pump puts out about 6 times as much as a small set of hands needs.  I ended up putting two silicone/rubber binders around the stem to reduce the distance the pump plunges.  Now it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice soothing wash...gentle but very good</li>
