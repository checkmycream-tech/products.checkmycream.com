<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love these brushes. Work just as well as Sigma Brushes without the steep cost of Sigma</li>
    <li> Super easy to work with.  Exceeded my expectations,  plan on buying the complete set plus a few extras.  I will definitely purchase more!!</li>
    <li> I love the Bdellium Tool brush line in general - I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding with any of their brushes. These brushes are great, if not a bit stiff - but very easy to care for. I especially love using the Contour Brush - it gives such a cool crease effect!</li>
    <li> I received my brush set in the mail on yesterday and used them this morning. OMG, I love this set. I am a make up addict and usually buy make up and brushes every chance I can get (at least once a month). I must admit this is the best set I have ever had. I bought MAC brushes and still don&#x27;t like them as much as I like this set. I like them so much I will be purchasing another set soon just so I will always have them!  I am also looking into buying the entire bdellium brush set line. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m a makeup novice, but I love these brushes; they hold up well to washing and come out clean quicker than any others I&#x27;ve owned. The green color is really pretty, and the brushes feel amazingly soft on my skin. These are going to last me a long time, and I&#x27;ll get a lot of use out of them!</li>
    <li> My first introduction to bdellium brushes was at the NY Make Up Show, where I purchased the Smoky Eye set as well as some a couple of face brushes in their Bambu line.  I am a professional make up artist &amp; hairstylist specializing in cruelty free beauty and have many vegan/eco focused clients, so I was in the market for professional grade vegan/eco friendly brushes that didn&#x27;t break the bank and would also be a product that I could recommend to my clients for personal use.    I was not disappointed!  The brushes are made of incredibly soft fibers that are great for sensitive skin (especially the delicate skin around the eyes!) that have the right balance of softness and density for a smooth application and flawless blending.  Because synthetic fibers are non-porous, these brushes have been easier to clean and maintain than natural fiber brushes I used in the past.  I know there are purists in the house who don&#x27;t like synthetic fiber brushes (I used to be one of them before making a shift towards a more conscious lifestyle and tweaking my kit thru trial and error), but these brushes are AMAZING.  The synthetic fibers don&#x27;t wear down with time and develop roughness on the cuticle like natural animal hair brushes do, so the application is consistent and even, and these are truly a professional grade product that are a must have for any compassionista who wants to be fabulous without compromise.    The price for this brush set is moderate/fair, which makes it great for professionals and &#x27;civilians&#x27; alike.  LOVE.  [...]</li>
    <li> as a professional makeup artist I go thru literally hundreds of brushes in my career - so, when I heard about Bdellium and ECO FRIENDLY - not having been on a VEGAN BRUSH bandwagon before I thought I&#x27;d give these a try - and I was plesantly surprised - I purchased the Bamboo Pro Line and absolutely fell in love with them!  They&#x27;re beautiful to look at - and I get a LOT of compliments and acknowledgement for that alone from my clients - which I love.  They&#x27;re also extremely soft and the shorter handle is my preferred length now - easy to carry and hold.  They are also - and this is KEY - EXTREMELY DENSE - and easy to clean - due to the fact they&#x27;re synthetic - and I have found little to NO \\&quot;hair\\&quot; drop from these - after 2 months of DAILY USE.  Beautiful, affordable, stellar performance all the way around.  I LOVE BDELLIUM TOOLS.  There, I said it.</li>
    <li> These are great eye color brushes.  Very soft.  They pick up and mix the colors well.&lt;br /&gt;They are considerably better than either the little sponges or other &#x27;professional&#x27; brushes I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a make up addict, and I love these brushes!  I have a very expensive Smashbox set, but these blend my eyeshadow much better, highly recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They are super super soft very sturdy and pretty in color. No shedding with the hair and not to heavy just perfect. I lovethese will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Brissles  are nice dont shead and washing them are even nicer shedding is none at all and the feel is awesome I am so glad that amazon had them they were 30$ plus 5 for shipping roughly on the website for bdellium. So a grrat deal and so very nice product.  Love it abd its green whi wouldnt want green.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes because the ones I have that are similar are old and running down, not doing their job. I read reviews on several different brush sets and decided on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the brushes do their job, there&#x27;s nothing spectacular about them. Yeah, the green bristles are cool, but it doesn&#x27;t make them makeup-artist grade in my opinion. Honestly I only use 2 or 3 of the brushes in the set. They do seem to have issues with holding onto the product, causing some fall-out. I had the same issue with my previous brushes so I don&#x27;t really see it as a con, just inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the brushes, still use them, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for a professional make-up artist.</li>
    <li> the bristles are nice and soft. they keep just the right abount of makeup on the brushes. Very easy to clean, and hold up very well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazingly soft. They are also really durable. I love the color and the fact that they are vegan and eco-friendly. They are the best makeup brushes I have ever owned and I&#x27;ve owned a lot of brushes(too faced, urban decay, tokidoki, ecotools, bare minerals, benefit, etc.)  They apply makeup beautifully and the best part is that they are SUPER affordable.</li>
    <li> This set is great, I can literally do any type of eye shadow look I want with just this set of brushes. I really love them, they are also soft and good quality for the price</li>
    <li> She loved them.  She sat down on her birthday and had a &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; day, something that young mothers rarely have time to do.  She loved the brushes and the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good, professional brushes.  My daughter&#x27;s recommendation:  Buy them; they&#x27;re worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a solid eyeshadow starter set. I adore all the brushes but I&#x27;m totally in love with the 716B and 760B liner brushes. The smokey eyeliner is great for applying shimmer to the inner corner of the eye and the liner/brow brush is hands down the best brush I have ever used for my gel eyeliner. These brushes are pretty damn perfect if you ask me.</li>
    <li> If you have any doubts about these brushes disregard and buy them! Ive owned mine for a year and wash them regularly. They have maintained their same shape since day one. They pick up product with ease amd not a lot of fuss and fall out. Well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I love Sonia Kashuk brushes sold at Target, but I needed smaller brushes for my eyebrows. I saw the write ups on Amazon so I decided to buy these bambu series. These brushes are awesome. My make up goes on great. It is easy to contour my eyebrows with these brushes. I would definitely buy this buy this brand again. It was a great price for a great set of sturdy and useful makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Love them perfect feeling with this brushes</li>
    <li> Best beauty purchase EVER. These and the other Bdellium brushes I got just upped my makeup game. Seriously, seriously worth the buy, you will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  They are very good quality.  I liked them so much, I have since added a couple more from the Bambu line to my set.</li>
    <li> Bristles are very soft but precise. I really enjoy using these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes work very well. The bristles aren&#x27;t too hard or too soft. They really make makeup application very easy.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I thought these would be better. They are nice enough and I do use them often, but I think I will probably move up from here.</li>
    <li> Very good set and quality for the price!  I was skeptical ordering online for brushes, but was pleasantly surprised at what i got.</li>
    <li> My first brush set. Never shed, never failed, not once. Incredibly soft and always delivered superb results when it came to blending. The best beginner brush set I have ever owned, and I have had many.</li>
    <li> I have bought a variety of brushes and these are my favorite, as I continue to grow my collection. They are soft and well made.</li>
    <li> I saw these brushes and read the reviews. I was a little skeptical because I always used Sigma brushes. These brushes are awesome. They are soft and give me the ability to do great detail work on my eyes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft! Washed them multiple times and they haven&#x27;t shed a single hair. Intact delivery by Senyx. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes - so glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> Great soft bristles for the price. Smaller than I expected but def.. comparable to Sedona lance brushes, def buy for those not trying to spend too much on quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. They are the same quality as mac brushes.</li>
    <li> Received these as a gift from my boyfriend and I am in LOVE!! Super soft and amazing. The eyeliner brush is my absolute fav!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was like &amp;#34;I am going to be here all day trying to apply my eyeliner with this small brush&amp;#34;...but its size is what makes my eyeliner so perfect! Its so small it reaches every imperfection and makes the line so precise and beautiful. Amazing brushes, happy I have them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush set a few weeks ago. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these brushes. They are so incredibly soft! I have had no issues with shedding or smells. I would buy them again in a heart beat. The tiny angled brush is perfect for getting a precise line. I use it for eyelining and filling in my brows with a powder. Fabulous brush set! I wish I would have orderd the face set as well.</li>
    <li> These brushes feel wonderful and are easy to use.  I have hooded eyes that are small and deep set so putting on eye makeup is a nightmare for me.  I gave up and just did darker colors on my lids like I shouldn&#x27;t for years and years until I bought these.  I look like I know what I&#x27;m doing when I use these!  They are very soft and clean quickly, too.  I haven&#x27;t used the angled contour brush for anything but I&#x27;m sure it would be suitable for precise facial contouring or even concealing.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This set is okay but far from a professional set.  For the price it does the job.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about them at first, but 30 seemed worth it if the brushes were good quality. I was really impressed, they work great! I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes for daily use as they blend well, clean nicely and hold their shape with minimal shedding. Very nice!</li>
    <li> I love many things about these brushes&lt;br /&gt;1. They are very soft&lt;br /&gt;2. The color is very pretty and true to the picture shown.&lt;br /&gt;3. The bristles are perfect-no frays or trimming necessary!&lt;br /&gt;4. Tube it comes in is good for storing them after use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems some complaints were based on the handle size of the brushes. I guess an athletic or larger size woman would have a bit of trouble with the grip and holding it steady. I could see that being true for those women. I have smaller size hands, dainty, and they are just perfect to me!</li>
    <li> This brushes are truly amazing! They are really soft and work super well! I recommend this to everyone whose looking for quality but do not want to pay a fortune for brushes. I use them everyday! GET THEM YOU WONT REGRET!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic!  They&#x27;re so soft and built really well.  They&#x27;re also just strikingly pretty  brushes.  Another bonus is that I have similar brushes to the ones in this set that cost me $20 for EACH brush, and with this set you get 5 fantastic brushes for such an amazing price!  I recommend these to people who are looking for high quality synthetic/vegan brushes!  Actually, I just recommend them for EVERYONE!  Also--be aware--these brushes run about 2 centimeters shorter (in handle length) as compared to \\&quot;standard\\&quot; brushes.  The shorter handles can offer you extra control, if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of brushes as a gift for a friend who is getting into makeup. The brushes arrived on time and from what I&#x27;ve been told by the friend that I bought them for they work great and are very easy to clean. They have a short handle which she says is ideal because you feel like you are getting in and using your fingers since you are not worrying about a long handle that could get in the way.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes and have used other Bdellium tools in the past. They are reasonably priced, have good selection of sizes and last a long time. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Haven&#x27;t really used the flat angled one, but appreciate all the others. No molting. Washes well. Applies makeup well.</li>
    <li> I love burshed, and these r very nice</li>
    <li> Brushes are really soft and seem durable after being washed. Blend really well, comparable to real techniques and sephora brushes. I&#x27;ve never tried any more expensive ones so I can&#x27;t compare! These are great though. Fast shipping too. 5/5 would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have these and probably about 10 or so other Green Bambu brushes. Simply put: they are fantastic. The brushes are 100% synthetic but are SUPER soft and function the way natural hair brushes do. I was really blown away because I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to like them. The handles are shorter than your average brush but larger than some travel brushes I&#x27;ve tried so they&#x27;re kind of in the middle. Here&#x27;s a quick breakdown of each brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#781B Crease - Great for concentrated color in the crease or outer \\&quot;v\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#777B Shadow - A small/medium shader brush for either packing on color or a light wash over the lid&lt;br /&gt;#769B Angled Contour - Use this for blending your crease color or contouring the nose&lt;br /&gt;#760B Liner/Brow - This brush head is so tiny. Great for tightlining or drawing a fine line&lt;br /&gt;#716B Smoky Eyeliner - Exactly what it says. Smoke out your liner for a diffused look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend. Nothing bad to say.</li>
    <li> I feel I paid to much for these brushes.  The bristles are a lot stiffer and scratchy than I thought they would be for having to be used on the sensitive eye skin.  They are not as dense as I thought they should be too.  I&#x27;m sorry maybe it&#x27;s just me because it seemed these got a lot if good reviews and that&#x27;s why I got them.  But seriously I paid too much.</li>
    <li> I love this brushes. They have perfect sizes and fit to the hand. Makeup with them is a pleasure.</li>
    <li> Renewable resources, fine brushes, great set. The wife uses 2 sets of these (this was the 2nd set) and absolutely loves them.</li>
    <li> Super soft and equal in quality to my M.A.C. And Kevyn Aucoin brushes. Wish I had purchased these first. I would have saved a lot of money!</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice....best is the brow/liner.  I only wish the other four were not as soft....but still a great deal.</li>
    <li> Super soft, wonderfully made. Worked well for applying eyeshadow and foundation around eyes. My favorite is the 760 liner and brow. My least fav would be the 769 as its too big to really use on or around your eyes. Bdellium also has a wonderful flat kabuki style foundation brush 957 which I bought multiples of fearing they might discontinue it. All and all it was nice to compare these to my mac and target brand brushes. If your new with applying make definately make the purchase for a 760 liner and brow and the flat kabuki 957 they are amazing and work just as well as my mac brushes!</li>
    <li> This is a great set of eye brushes. I received them on New Years Eve so I got to try them all out! :) First, they look great. It made me sad to use dark eyeshadow and tarnish their green beauty. The handles are bamboo and very lightweight/short. I liked that about them. The metal piece is firmly attached to the bamboo handle, unlike the cheap eye brushes I had before. The fibers are very soft and they don&#x27;t fall out even with washing. They are also quite dense and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure about spending this much on 5 brushes when there are so many sets for half the price and 3 times the brushes. I am glad I did though. I can tell that these will last a long time with proper care. Now I am going to buy the face brushes! :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are ok.  I mainly gravitate towards the pencil and shader brushes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush set to replace some much over used Bobbie Brown brushes.  I am very pleased with them so far.  I think they will hold up very well.  The handles are much shorter then my old set but I just took them on a recent week long trip and I like the portability. They seem well made and will hold up to daily use and weekly washings.</li>
    <li> These brushes are such good quality. I&#x27;ve used them for about a year now- they&#x27;re easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed (a TINY bit when I first washed them, but so much less than any other brush I&#x27;ve encountered). I liked these so much I bought the rest of them. Absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> They are Super soft, they came right on schedule and I use them all the time. They are Very versatile.</li>
    <li> Several brushes that really work well for a reasonable price. How can u go wrong? I definitely recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes.  These are the best brushes I have purchased so far and I have tried many different brands.  I Love that they don&#x27;t shed like others.  They are super soft and very well made.  I honestly can&#x27;t say enough good things about these.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so nice and so soft! I&#x27;m loving them!</li>
    <li> Quality product. Very pleased</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Super soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this set along with two others to replace some grimy old brushes that I&#x27;d had for years. These are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. The bristles are very soft and pick up product readily and make things really easily blendable. The handles are very smooth and the perfect length for holding onto without being cumbersome. The color is also extremely vibrant. I&#x27;ve had them for several months now, and have washed them weekly without so much as a single brush shedding a hair. I highly recommend these, they&#x27;re an excellent value!</li>
    <li> The tips were larger than I thought they&#x27;d be. I like the brushes, but I would have liked one nice one to spread shadow and they didn&#x27;t include that.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes... love them soooo much I bought the 15 piece set.  Brushes are super soft and apply makeup great. I would recommend to any one great starter set and good price.</li>
