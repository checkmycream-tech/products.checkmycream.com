      <li>It&#x27;s brilliant and allows me to comb through her hair with ease.</li>
      <li>Smells great and works great on my daughters curly hair.</li>
      <li>rate it 3 stars  because the conditioner really is a good product</li>
      <li>My daughter has wavy, dense Indian hair and this also does a good job at hydrating it.</li>
      <li>Omg it smells sooooo good</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This is great lotion but the fragrance is a bit too strong.</li>
      <li>This product is the amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>Still, a nice product.</li>
      <li>I put 3 stars because it smells great but moisture wise not so much like the shampoo u have to use a ton to get some kinda effect going</li>
      <li>Try at Sally&#x27;s first before Amazon if you aren&#x27;t sure they let your return/exchange If you aren&#x27;t happy with products.</li>
      <li>But its okay.</li>
      <li>I will purchase this product for years to come, love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>I was able to find this online at Target on sale for eight dollars.</li>
      <li>i guess:)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is over the top perfumy smelling and does not smell at all like mango, which I had hoped for, or even carrot.  </li>
      <li>Even though I dislike the shampoo that goes with this, I really love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love love the smell</li>
      <li>But i realize i had to get the shampoo make it work pretty good.</li>
      <li>(I smelled how wonderful it was on a friend&#x27;s child and was willing to pay much more than I normally do for conditioner.)</li>
      <li>I love this product, it works great for my 2 years old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong, but we LOVE it</li>
      <li>but...the smell is way too strong.</li>
      <li>The fragrance was really strong.  </li>
      <li>That perfume smell is insanely strong still 2 days out and even rinsing it another time.  </li>
      <li>My daughters hair is fine maybe a 3-4a and it works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Third: for this product the type of hair your child has is an important factor.</li>
      <li>Still full of curls but manageable and glorious now.</li>
      <li>And the smell is pretty strong too, like a mens cologne.</li>
      <li>It is highly moisturizing for the hair, making it look and feel healthy.  </li>
      <li>Good conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it for us.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>And the first ingredient is water.</li>
      <li>I was able to run my fingers through my hair and put it back into two pigtails after rinsing the product out (after leaving it on each side of my head for 2 minutes) without a problem.</li>
      <li>I was going to use this for a regular conditioner, but this is so much more.</li>
      <li>Bought this in hopes of taming my girls ong, curly, tangly, dry, yet fine hair and wanting to stay on the more natural side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My daughter actually gets compliments constantly about how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
      <li>First: this stuff smells great &amp; it definitely isn&#x27;t too perfumey as other ratings have put.</li>
      <li>it made my hair feel super soft and moisturized the moment I put it on (don&#x27;t need much product) .</li>
      <li>I was actually surprised by how strong the smell is especially since it is for children.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I hesitated a little bit to buy it because of the reviews complaining about the supposed strong smell; well it smells just right to me.</li>
      <li>When I first sniffed it in the bottle, it gave me an instant headache, but I figured maybe once it was mixed with water and then rinsed out, it wouldn&#x27;t be so strong.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>A little heavy for kid&#x27;s fine hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell quite as nice as the accompanything shampoo.</li>
      <li>so if your&#x27;e going to waste your money/time, you might as well buy from there instead and be able to return it easier.</li>
      <li>This may work better on very coarse hair, or hair that needs the oils to define tight curls, but it is definitely not for fine hair.</li>
      <li>All four of us have straight hair, and though it seems that it works particularly well for coarse, curly hair, we like it as well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made our lives SO much easier and only combing her curls once a day for 5 min has been a blessing.</li>
      <li>This conditioner leaves hair soft and silky; it delivers all the label promises</li>
      <li>7 year old loves the smell because she says it smells like Grandma.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it leave it soft</li>
      <li>I would not recommend for use on a child or anyone is sensitive or allergic to perfume.</li>
      <li>So if your child has sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
      <li>I got it for my daughter based on the reviews, I was looking for a natural product that works well.</li>
      <li>It leaves the hair soft.</li>
      <li>First I tried using just the shampoo, their hair was too dry and tangly.  </li>
      <li>Even the next morning when my hair was dry it still smelled like oranges, was super soft</li>
      <li>The product has a super perfume smell and it really ruins the experience.</li>
      <li>If you needed to get the flyaways away but still have a soft feel and not being weighed down use Kinky Curly, which I love better than Eco styler because it holds but not a super hard hold and its healthier.</li>
      <li>: My daughter has VERY delicate skin and can get ezcema on her face easy</li>
      <li>I avoid putting it close to the scalp as it does weigh my daughters&#x27; fine hair down and make it look oily, so I concentrate on the bottom half of their long hair.  </li>

<li> She is 2 and not happy with combing through her hair.</li>
<li> but i only used it twice on my daughter because it made her eczema real bad!</li>
<li> This left my daughters hair looking awful.</li>
<li> WRONG!  </li>

    <li> Even though I dislike the shampoo that goes with this, I really love this conditioner. it made my hair feel super soft and moisturized the moment I put it on (don&#x27;t need much product) . I was able to run my fingers through my hair and put it back into two pigtails after rinsing the product out (after leaving it on each side of my head for 2 minutes) without a problem. Even the next morning when my hair was dry it still smelled like oranges, was super soft and I had defined curls. Will definitely be buying this again!!</li>
    <li> Bought this in hopes of taming my girls ong, curly, tangly, dry, yet fine hair and wanting to stay on the more natural side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing to actually moisturize the hair (only made it greasy) and did not help with tangles.  First I tried using just the shampoo, their hair was too dry and tangly.  So I then tried with the conditioner - still wasn&#x27;t moisturized, was greasy instead, and still tangly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is over the top perfumy smelling and does not smell at all like mango, which I had hoped for, or even carrot.  When I first sniffed it in the bottle, it gave me an instant headache, but I figured maybe once it was mixed with water and then rinsed out, it wouldn&#x27;t be so strong.  WRONG!  That perfume smell is insanely strong still 2 days out and even rinsing it another time.  I can hardly stand to have my girls heads near me right now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 7 year old loves the smell because she says it smells like Grandma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that it&#x27;s cheaper at target online so if your&#x27;e going to waste your money/time, you might as well buy from there instead and be able to return it easier.</li>
    <li> I love love the smell but i only used it twice on my daughter because it made her eczema real bad! So if your child has sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> I put 3 stars because it smells great but moisture wise not so much like the shampoo u have to use a ton to get some kinda effect going i guess:)</li>
    <li> I have thick , curly hair I have spent a life time trying to cope with. Trying every manner of product under the sun. Now I have a daughter and was going through same with her until I found this product. It&#x27;s brilliant and allows me to comb through her hair with ease. She is 2 and not happy with combing through her hair. This product takes out the snarles effortlessly and turns her hair to silk. Still full of curls but manageable and glorious now.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target. I was going to use this for a regular conditioner, but this is so much more. The other reviewer stated this was oily and it was ment for her daughters flyaways. 1st thing it says on the bottle is moisturizer. If you needed to get the flyaways away but still have a soft feel and not being weighed down use Kinky Curly, which I love better than Eco styler because it holds but not a super hard hold and its healthier. This product is the amazing. I use it for a leave in conditioner and it moisturizes enough even in the dead of winter. But its not oily!! Omg it smells sooooo good I rub it in my hands afterwards. This is food for your hair and your kids hair. My hair is a 4C and I have a TWA. My daughters hair is fine maybe a 3-4a and it works. I will purchase this product for years to come, love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> But i realize i had to get the shampoo make it work pretty good. But its okay. it leave it soft</li>
    <li> This is great lotion but the fragrance is a bit too strong. My son doesn&#x27;t mind it but my daughter refuses to let me use it because of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works great for my 2 years old daughter&#x27;s hair. It leaves the hair soft. I hesitated a little bit to buy it because of the reviews complaining about the supposed strong smell; well it smells just right to me. It is my must have now, and i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. Good conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
    <li> The fragrance was really strong.  My girls didn&#x27;t mind the scent.  I couldn&#x27;t stand it and bought another conditioner instead of having them use this one.  Their hair didn&#x27;t seem dramatically smoother after use compared to other conditioners.</li>
    <li> This is the only line that I use for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has very dry hair that requires a lot of moisture, and this stuff does the trick!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and works awesome</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves hair soft and silky; it delivers all the label promises but...the smell is way too strong. The product has a super perfume smell and it really ruins the experience. I would not recommend for use on a child or anyone is sensitive or allergic to perfume. I was actually surprised by how strong the smell is especially since it is for children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate it 3 stars  because the conditioner really is a good product but I knocked off 2 stars because it is way too scented for a children&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> I got it for my daughter based on the reviews, I was looking for a natural product that works well. I am a big fan now, the smell is heavenly and my daughter&#x27;s hair don&#x27;t get tangled up anymore. I would highly recommend this product. My daughter has wavy, dense Indian hair and this also does a good job at hydrating it.</li>
    <li> I was able to find this online at Target on sale for eight dollars. This left my daughters hair looking awful. Its labeled for dry &amp; delicate. Her hair is not dry, just flyaways, but I gave it a shot because I&#x27;d consider her hair delicate, she is two. Her hair looked so oily after using this with the shampoo. When I read the ingredients the second &amp; third ingredients are an oil. So no wonder. And the first ingredient is water. This may work better on very coarse hair, or hair that needs the oils to define tight curls, but it is definitely not for fine hair. Even her ringlet curls that she has disappeared from the weight of this product, left her hair stringy looking. And the smell is pretty strong too, like a mens cologne.</li>
    <li> This conditioner did not help my daughter&#x27;s hair at all.</li>
    <li> My family with three girls has been using this conditioner for 6 months. Even I am using it now. We love it!!!  All four of us have straight hair, and though it seems that it works particularly well for coarse, curly hair, we like it as well.  I avoid putting it close to the scalp as it does weigh my daughters&#x27; fine hair down and make it look oily, so I concentrate on the bottom half of their long hair.  The smell is strong, but we LOVE it (I smelled how wonderful it was on a friend&#x27;s child and was willing to pay much more than I normally do for conditioner.) It is highly moisturizing for the hair, making it look and feel healthy.  I even use it as a detangler by putting it in a spray bottle and adding an equal amount of water.  And when lice crops up at school, I plan to load up their scalps with Shea Naturals, so the oils and smell will help deter critter infestation on my girls. Pricey but worth it for us.</li>
    <li> First: this stuff smells great &amp; it definitely isn&#x27;t too perfumey as other ratings have put. I opened it up and smelled it at Sally&#x27;s before buying. My daughter actually gets compliments constantly about how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: My daughter has VERY delicate skin and can get ezcema on her face easy and this never ever irritates her!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third: for this product the type of hair your child has is an important factor. And you only need to use the smallest amount. We use everyday shea lavender shampoo and rinse out then we put this in comb out her thousands of tight springy curls and pat dry. We do not rinse it out. It holds the mouister overnight and keeps her curls defined and silly and springy so in the morning it only needs a few spritz of her all in one miracle spray and she&#x27;s good to go!!!! It&#x27;s made our lives SO much easier and only combing her curls once a day for 5 min has been a blessing. Love this stuff! Try at Sally&#x27;s first before Amazon if you aren&#x27;t sure they let your return/exchange If you aren&#x27;t happy with products.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great on my daughters curly hair. I even use it as a leave-in even though its not advertised as such.</li>
    <li> A little heavy for kid&#x27;s fine hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell quite as nice as the accompanything shampoo. Still, a nice product.</li>
