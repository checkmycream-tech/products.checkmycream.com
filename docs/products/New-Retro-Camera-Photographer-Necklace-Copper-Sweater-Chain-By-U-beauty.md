<li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but even my small expectations wernt met.</li>
<li> when she opened the gift, it was way different than the picture, and was bigger than expected.</li>

    <li> The flash piece was broke off and unfixable so I was disappointed. It was a gift and had already came a month after the birthday.</li>
    <li> I loved the look of the necklace, but when I received it and took it out of the package, it broke.  It is now missing the stone and another piece.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> It was not the same as in the picture. I know it was cheap but it was such poor quality and the whole metal piece was bent in a u-shape. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it was a cute necklace but looked a lot different from the picture the orange/brown round piece you see is a piece of fabric the camera lens part was not as clean and shiny as it is in the picture it was dull but over all it is a pretty cute necklace just looks a bit  diffrent</li>
    <li> Very cute, and clever.  Great gift for a photographer.</li>
    <li> I like it  New retro phitographer</li>
    <li> Everyone loves this when I wear it! They love the pop of color! Being a photographer I can wear it with any outfit!</li>
    <li> very reasonable price and came in a good amount of time but it doesn&#x27;t look exactly as the picture depicts it to be</li>
    <li> I recently received this product and I loved it! I have already gotten some complements on it, it is just slightly different from the picture but I love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even look The pic I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> Cute cute cute. Worth the only couple dollars spent. :) very happy</li>
    <li> Arrived as listed. Thank you</li>
    <li> The charm was much bigger than I expected, it&#x27;s ok. I will use it as a pull decoration on my camera bag rather than a necklace.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t that bad it looked kinda like the picture but instead of leather it was a piece of sewing cloth very disappointed in that but in all very good</li>
    <li> The orange thing you see in the picture is a piece of a carrot burnt orange cloth the item camera looked green the chain part was brown and it only came down to my collar bone. I was hoping for a lower hanging necklace. I can not find an outfit to wear with it. It looks completely different from the picture I was very dissatisfied and would never even consider buying again and would highly recommend unless its for a younger kid 10- don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I sent this to a friend as a gift for his sister and she was very pleased with it</li>
    <li> Has long, leather chain. Good detailing on the camera.</li>
    <li> This is an inaccurate depiction of the product. It&#x27;s not very similar in person.</li>
    <li> i ordered this necklace as a gift for my friend. when she opened the gift, it was way different than the picture, and was bigger than expected. the camera has an orange marble as the lense, and has a different shape overall. however, it still looked nice. i wouldnt order this again though.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but even my small expectations wernt met. Looks like a two dollar trinket from china</li>
