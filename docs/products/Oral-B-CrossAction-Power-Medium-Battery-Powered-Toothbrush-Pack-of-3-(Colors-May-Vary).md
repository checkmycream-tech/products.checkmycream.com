### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>One of the best features about this toothbrush is the fact that it has a replaceable head.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second, the battery life is awesome.</li>
      <li>but it turned out to be the battery which after I changed worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is the best I have ever</li>
      <li>An awesome and inexpensive toothbrush!</li>
      <li>And what a joy this power toothbrush is to use!</li>
      <li>Also, the fact that it works off 1 AA battery is incredibly convenient.</li>
      <li>your dentist recommends this, good for you!</li>
      <li>They do make a great toothbrush; but I still use floss or a gum stimulant with a rubber tip to remove food particles after brushing with the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great durable toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My Oral B CrossAction was good for a while...</li>
      <li>Amazing toothbrush for the $13 price-tag.</li>
      <li>The difference is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Thought it would be more like the Pulsar, but the spinning brush just isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
      <li>Sure, it is inexpensive, and it probably is a good product for the price...  </li>
      <li>I thought I was good brushing manually, but now I feel my teeth are twice as clean.</li>
      <li>But again, this one is really excellent, especially for travel.</li>
      <li>The one thing that the Oral B has going for it is that it has a better motor than most of the electrics that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;).</li>
      <li>This battry-powered toothbrush works better than anticipated.  </li>
      <li>This very good toothbrush by Oral B cleans my teeth and stimulates my gums better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I would say that 30% more plaque was easily removed.</li>
      <li>Have had my crossaction more than a year and is still going strong.</li>
      <li>The cleansing power is great and there isn&#x27;t much effort that is needed to thoroughly clean your teeth.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t spatter, and doesn&#x27;t nanny you to death with beeps and stops.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and it leaves your teeth feeling like you just had them cleaned by a dentist.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to do.  </li>
      <li>The battery is still going strong, and for the $6</li>
      <li>Item looks fine and will be taken on a trip in a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>and it has worked wonderfully in vibrating those little food particles out</li>
      <li>Other than that this is a pretty awesome toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I first thought that I had to use more force while brushing</li>
      <li>Only the rotating top portion was effective.    </li>
      <li>I found this toothbrush gives a sufficient amount of power and my teeth feel clean.</li>
      <li>B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]  </li>
      <li>Works just as good as other electric tootbrushes double and triple its cost, however it is not as good as some of the more elite toothbrushes ranging 35 and up.</li>
      <li>Meaning that you don&#x27;t need to throw away the whole unit just to get a better cleaning experience.</li>
      <li>The bristles move in a circular and back and forth motiopn giving the teet a really good cleaning.</li>
      <li>I really like the Oral B much better</li>
      <li>However, I now feel obligated to give it a full 5/5.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the purchase, but the packing/shipping charges are disproportionately high.</li>
      <li>Crisp and clean.  </li>
      <li>Also, very sleek handle and light build</li>
      <li>I think that you&#x27;re better off with a an old fashioned medium-bristle manual toothbrush than this electric.</li>
      <li>or so it is so worth it.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money if you want automatic brush with you.</li>
      <li>Cleaning the inside of the toothbrush is easy, when you buy the replacement brushheads there is a device included that allows you to open your toothbrush so that you can clean the inside parts as well as replace the head.     </li>
      <li>Needless to day, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
      <li>and I can confidently say that this does the same job at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>it only spins when it is very very lightly touching the teeth.  </li>
      <li>It really is a bargain at $6.99 (or $6.69 at Wal-Mart)!</li>
      <li>After brushing with the Oral B Crossaction for the first time, I immediately noticed how well it cleaned compared to a manual brush.</li>
      <li>This is a really good product; however, if you&#x27;re serious about clean teeth, you should get the one that plugs</li>
      <li>The original AA that came with the brush lasted the entire first quarter of my Freshman year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, that&#x27;s a small price to pay in exchange for the exceptional cleaning and build quality that comes with it.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing little engineering marvel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for a few months and its amazing.  </li>
      <li>highly recommended!</li>
      <li>but them as stocking stuffers last christmas for the family to enjoy.</li>
      <li>Went to the store to replace my old Oral-B manual brush, and saw this Power model for only about two dollars more.  </li>
      <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t clean very well.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;First, it provides a more thorough cleaning than any other toothbrush I have tried.</li>
      <li>If you get this product from a store, keep in mind that it is possible to try out the toothbrush while it is sealed, so you might not have a full charge.</li>
      <li>Leaves your teeth feeling slippery and nice and is slim and maneuverable enough to get far back to the molars.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>since that means that it has to lay flat on a counter or in a cabinet, taking up much more space than necessary and risking getting knocked on the floor when the countertop gets crowded.</li>
      <li>you should all notice that it doesnt spin if you touch your teeth using normal pressure.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Third, the batteries are easily replaceable by unscrewing the bottom half of the handle.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s similar to a manual toothbrush in size and weight and works just like the higher end electric toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>The original design of the brush was changed in order to prevent the brush from accidently coming loose while in use, but the new brush design has definitely corrected that problem.</li>
      <li>Fundamentally, I simply didn&#x27;t feel that it cleaned my teeth very well.</li>
      <li>I used the Oral B Sonic Complete for about a year</li>
      <li>The toothbrush also lets you choose between replaceable soft and medium brushheads--something I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
      <li>My dentist also noticed my gums were firmer from the massaging action of the bristles.</li>
      <li>-B claims that this toothbrush will remove as much plaque as regular brushing and flossing combined.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;d think this was an electric fancy toothbrush, tons of power for a battery operated item, just as good as the expensive ones in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It definitely does a better job of brushing than a plain toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I had to use more force than I should have to clean around my gums and the second row of bristles with the up-down motion proved nearly useless.</li>
      <li>If you use NiMH rechargeable batteries, you can also be green and life-on-earth friendly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no illusion this time--this is one terrific toothbrush, especially considering the reasonable price for all that you get.</li>
      <li>Having evaluated several electric toothbrushes recently, I find that the actual cleaning action of this toothbrush ranks at the very bottom.    </li>
      <li>I formerly used a Sonicare electronic toothbrush which was much more expensive, vibrates the entire head instead of just the teeth, and has a less appealing design in terms of its curvature and ability to reach into the back areas.</li>
      <li>The first few times I used it it reminded me of a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a professional model Roto-Dent brush for a few years, but lately have been using mostly manual brushes.  </li>

    <li> This is a really good product; however, if you&#x27;re serious about clean teeth, you should get the one that plugs in.[[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]  But again, this one is really excellent, especially for travel.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it provides a more thorough cleaning than any other toothbrush I have tried. The closest competitor is probably Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the battery life is awesome. The original AA that came with the brush lasted the entire first quarter of my Freshman year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the batteries are easily replaceable by unscrewing the bottom half of the handle.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does the job and at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Crest spin brush for several years. I really like the Oral B much better and it only uses 1 AA battery instead of 2.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for over a week now. In the beginning the bristles felt very stiff and uncomfortable, but after about a week they softened up due to regular brushing. The cleansing power is great and there isn&#x27;t much effort that is needed to thoroughly clean your teeth. I have a partially erupted wisdom tooth and while in waiting to get it extracted I have used this toothbrush to brush around that tooth and it has worked wonderfully in vibrating those little food particles out (ewww I know). It is loud, but not significantly so. Amazing toothbrush for the $13 price-tag. Very happy with this toothbrush. Also, very sleek handle and light build &#x3D;). Yippeee!</li>
    <li> you&#x27;d think this was an electric fancy toothbrush, tons of power for a battery operated item, just as good as the expensive ones in my opinion. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> A so and so brush for travel. Worth the money if you want automatic brush with you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a professional model Roto-Dent brush for a few years, but lately have been using mostly manual brushes.  Went to the store to replace my old Oral-B manual brush, and saw this Power model for only about two dollars more.  Wow!  The difference is amazing.  Crisp and clean.  I bought another for my wife, and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> you should all notice that it doesnt spin if you touch your teeth using normal pressure.  it only spins when it is very very lightly touching the teeth.  this makes this brush useless.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and of quality make. Have had my crossaction more than a year and is still going strong. The bristles move in a circular and back and forth motiopn giving the teet a really good cleaning. Works just as good as other electric tootbrushes double and triple its cost, however it is not as good as some of the more elite toothbrushes ranging 35 and up.

    <li> Seldom do you encounter a product that so thoroughly exceeds your expectations and costs so little. This is an amazing little engineering marvel. And what a joy this power toothbrush is to use! Leaves your teeth feeling slippery and nice and is slim and maneuverable enough to get far back to the molars. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t spatter, and doesn&#x27;t nanny you to death with beeps and stops. If you use NiMH rechargeable batteries, you can also be green and life-on-earth friendly.</li>
    <li> My Oral B CrossAction was good for a while... and then it seems that manufacturing of the brush head went down in quality. The brush head started coming loose and move up and down as the brush was spinning. This pinched and hurt my lips.    Sure, it is inexpensive, and it probably is a good product for the price...  but in that case, I would opt for the Oral B D-4 toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Having evaluated several electric toothbrushes recently, I find that the actual cleaning action of this toothbrush ranks at the very bottom.    It&#x27;s noisier than other electrics, the round bottom is an awful \\&quot;innovation\\&quot; since that means that it has to lay flat on a counter or in a cabinet, taking up much more space than necessary and risking getting knocked on the floor when the countertop gets crowded. But that&#x27;s not why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush.    Fundamentally, I simply didn&#x27;t feel that it cleaned my teeth very well. I had to use more force than I should have to clean around my gums and the second row of bristles with the up-down motion proved nearly useless. Only the rotating top portion was effective.    The one thing that the Oral B has going for it is that it has a better motor than most of the electrics that I&#x27;ve tried. For example, the plastic junctions in a Colgate electric toothbrush skip as soon as I apply any pressure to the bristles and it actually stops from the friction while I&#x27;m cleaning my back teeth. The Oral B neither skips nor stops while I&#x27;m brushing. It simply doesn&#x27;t clean very well.    I think that you&#x27;re better off with a an old fashioned medium-bristle manual toothbrush than this electric. If you must buy an electric, look for one with two revolving heads. The cross-action is not very effective.</li>
    <li> I have waited a few months to write this review so that I would have real experience to base my review on, and I have been pleased with this product. I formerly used a Sonicare electronic toothbrush which was much more expensive, vibrates the entire head instead of just the teeth, and has a less appealing design in terms of its curvature and ability to reach into the back areas. I found this toothbrush gives a sufficient amount of power and my teeth feel clean. The first few times I used it it reminded me of a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.    If you get this product from a store, keep in mind that it is possible to try out the toothbrush while it is sealed, so you might not have a full charge. I first thought that I had to use more force while brushing but it turned out to be the battery which after I changed worked perfectly. It uses one AA battery.     Cleaning the inside of the toothbrush is easy, when you buy the replacement brushheads there is a device included that allows you to open your toothbrush so that you can clean the inside parts as well as replace the head.     I recommend this toothbrush over a traditional or electronic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for a few months and its amazing.  I brushed my teeth with the standard manual toothbrush for 24 years, and after using this brush I wish my parents would have started me out on it.  You just can&#x27;t get the cleaning from regular brushes you get from this brush with the rapidly rotating brush head.  Plus, it prevents gum damage and overbrushing, and allows you to use less pressure.  The battery is still going strong, and for the $6 or so it is so worth it.  I thought I was good brushing manually, but now I feel my teeth are twice as clean.</li>
    <li> This battry-powered toothbrush works better than anticipated.  It is easy to use, and it leaves your teeth feeling like you just had them cleaned by a dentist.  It definitely does a better job of brushing than a plain toothbrush.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> After brushing with the Oral B Crossaction for the first time, I immediately noticed how well it cleaned compared to a manual brush. I would say that 30% more plaque was easily removed. And I&#x27;m no newbie to electric toothbrushes.. I used the Oral B Sonic Complete for about a year and I can confidently say that this does the same job at a fraction of the price. Also, the fact that it works off 1 AA battery is incredibly convenient. I also like the form factor of the toothbrush itself. It&#x27;s similar to a manual toothbrush in size and weight and works just like the higher end electric toothbrushes. It really is a bargain at $6.99 (or $6.69 at Wal-Mart)! One of the best features about this toothbrush is the fact that it has a replaceable head. Meaning that you don&#x27;t need to throw away the whole unit just to get a better cleaning experience. I do have one complaint though.. this little guy makes quite a bit of noise. So brushing late at night when others around are sleeping is a big no no. Other than that this is a pretty awesome toothbrush. I&#x27;ve purchased 3 extra to give to friends as gifts. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (4/1/2012):&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how long this toothbrush has lasted! I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years now (changing the brush head regularly of course) and it still works as well as it did on day one. I had previously rated this product at 4/5 stars. However, I now feel obligated to give it a full 5/5. Of course, when operating the toothbrush&#x27;s volume is louder than I&#x27;d like. However, that&#x27;s a small price to pay in exchange for the exceptional cleaning and build quality that comes with it. Needless to day, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> An awesome and inexpensive toothbrush!</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using the Oral-B CrossAction Battery-Powered Toothbrush, powered by one Alkaline AA battery, for a few years. We both prefer it over the manual toothbrush because we feel that the final results are cleaner teeth in less time, and at a  price considerably lower than that of several of the other name brand powered toothbrushes.  The original design of the brush was changed in order to prevent the brush from accidently coming loose while in use, but the new brush design has definitely corrected that problem.</li>
    <li> Battery toothbrush bought for travel because it is small and packable. Item looks fine and will be taken on a trip in a couple of weeks. I am satisfied with the purchase, but the packing/shipping charges are disproportionately high.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B CrossAction Power Battery toothbrush uses a single replaceable AA battery to make the bristles of the toothbrush pivot back and forth to stimulate gums and get off food residue before it can turn into plaque or tartar. The toothbrush also lets you choose between replaceable soft and medium brushheads--something I&#x27;ve never seen before. The bristles fade halfway when you need to replace the head of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B claims that this toothbrush will remove as much plaque as regular brushing and flossing combined.  They do make a great toothbrush; but I still use floss or a gum stimulant with a rubber tip to remove food particles after brushing with the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your dentist recommends this, good for you! This very good toothbrush by Oral B cleans my teeth and stimulates my gums better than a regular toothbrush. It&#x27;s no illusion this time--this is one terrific toothbrush, especially considering the reasonable price for all that you get.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be more like the Pulsar, but the spinning brush just isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these after the dentist recommended I get an electric toothbrush because flossing wasn&#x27;t doing the job.  This is terrific.  You can change the head when the bristles begin wearing out.  It&#x27;s easy to do.  My dentist also noticed my gums were firmer from the massaging action of the bristles. Now when I go for a checkup I spend less time in the chair getting the plaque taken off.  I still need to floss but it just routine.</li>
