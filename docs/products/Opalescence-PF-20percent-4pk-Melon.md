      <li>This is an excellent price.</li>
      <li>Very good product.  </li>
      <li>Great home whitener.</li>
      <li>This works though not as great as some I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>This melon flavor works great for me and the wife.  </li>
      <li>The product works great</li>
      <li>so I know it&#x27;s safe!!</li>
      <li>Loved the melon versus the mint flavor.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the product and will definatly buy more because they are much more affordable on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love it &amp; so do my kids!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and great results.</li>
      <li>This is kind</li>
      <li>but that is manufacturer issue as it does taste better than the mint</li>
      <li>I still have one more syringe for a touch-up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it had an experation sticker.</li>
      <li>So glad that there is another flavor out there.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Colgate is better.</li>
      <li>This works a lot better than crest whitestrips and a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>20% did the job very quickly w/o extreme sensitivity - just use Sensodyne and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
      <li>I actually think these I purchased on Amazon work better than the ones I paid much more at my dentist for.</li>
      <li>SUPER quick ship.  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper than purchasing at dentist!!</li>
      <li>Not as strong as the 20% that I have used before, maybe these are older syringes and have lost some strength?&lt;br</li>
      <li>My teeth are so nice and white.</li>
      <li>I used it with my clear retainers for top and bottom that I have from history of braces.</li>
      <li>The lower 9% that Colgate sells is much better, less time and better whitening.</li>
      <li>Might elect for the lesser percentage for the next order to use overnight.</li>
      <li>First time using this percentage level and got mild sensitivity on teeth for a whole day.</li>
      <li>I used overnight and got results with first application.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Product as described and came promptly  While it is not the seller&#x27;s fault there should be a manufacture and expiration date on the package  Doesn&#x27;t really taste like melon</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying this item for me.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Product shipped so fast-</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have bought opalescene from other sellers and felt like it may have been expired but this time I see results quickly</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a big difference in my teeth color.</li>
      <li>Again, might be old syringes that have lost their taste.</li>
      <li>I bought two different strengths , the high strength left burn sores in my mouth after 2 minutes...</li>
      <li>I normally purchase the other flavor and prefer this one.</li>

<li> if you go stronger, not good for teeth and will get too sensitive!</li>
<li> A lot less than other internet sites I have shopped.</li>
<li> Beware though, it broke down some of my gums where it leaked up and out while I used them overnight.</li>
<li> It is so slight, why is it even flavored.  </li>
<li> I have used this brand before, there isn&#x27;t anything technically wrong with them, but I was expecting two different things.&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
<li> , I feel that I could take it up a few notches!</li>
<li> No results :(  vs. dentist-purchased Opalescence.</li>

    <li> Great home whitener. I used it with my clear retainers for top and bottom that I have from history of braces. Beware though, it broke down some of my gums where it leaked up and out while I used them overnight. Might elect for the lesser percentage for the next order to use overnight.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a big difference in my teeth color.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I like the 20%. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums.  This is an excellent price. A lot less than other internet sites I have shopped.</li>
    <li> Product as described and came promptly  While it is not the seller&#x27;s fault there should be a manufacture and expiration date on the package  Doesn&#x27;t really taste like melon but that is manufacturer issue as it does taste better than the mint</li>
    <li> When I went to the dentist to get whitening, he sent me home with this. It worked so well that I was amazed! I&#x27;ve never whitened before the dentist visit, and I will never use anything except this!</li>
    <li> Im on day two of opalescene and I can see a difference already. I have bought opalescene from other sellers and felt like it may have been expired but this time I see results quickly so I know its not out of date. The product works great and I used to buy it from my dentist for close to two hundred dollars. This works a lot better than crest whitestrips and a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> same as from dentist but way less $$$. if you go stronger, not good for teeth and will get too sensitive!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. This product does whiten your teeth as described, however it was just not to the extent I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Loved the melon versus the mint flavor. 20% did the job very quickly w/o extreme sensitivity - just use Sensodyne and you&#x27;re good to go.  I still have one more syringe for a touch-up.</li>
    <li> I can not stand MINT.  This melon flavor works great for me and the wife.  So glad that there is another flavor out there.  I just had to find it.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this item for me.</li>
    <li> Colgate is better. This left white spots and didn&#x27;t seem to whiten evenly. The lower 9% that Colgate sells is much better, less time and better whitening.</li>
    <li> Product shipped so fast- would def buy from this seller again!  This is kind you have to leave in all night so you want fitted teeth trays from the dentist.  I&#x27;m going to try the 35% next, I feel that I could take it up a few notches!</li>
    <li> No results :(  vs. dentist-purchased Opalescence.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than purchasing at dentist!! I&#x27;m glad it had an experation sticker. I normally purchase the other flavor and prefer this one. I leave on for 3 hours.</li>
    <li> First time using this percentage level and got mild sensitivity on teeth for a whole day. I used overnight and got results with first application. Flavor is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple - do not waste your money this stuff does not work!  I bought two different strengths , the high strength left burn sores in my mouth after 2 minutes...</li>
    <li> Works great!! Cheaper than getting it from my dentist office. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; so do my kids! Use to buy it from my dentist so I know it&#x27;s safe!!</li>
    <li> I have used this brand before, there isn&#x27;t anything technically wrong with them, but I was expecting two different things.&lt;br /&gt;1.  Not as strong as the 20% that I have used before, maybe these are older syringes and have lost some strength?&lt;br /&gt;2.  Did not have the melon taste that I wanted.  Not like a different taste, but just no taste at all.  It is so slight, why is it even flavored.  Again, might be old syringes that have lost their taste.</li>
    <li> My teeth are so nice and white. I have been using opalescence for 5 years and I love it. Easy to use and great results. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> 1/2 the price of what my dentist was selling for.  SUPER quick ship.  Ordered on Monday and had by Wednesday.</li>
    <li> This works though not as great as some I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I actually think these I purchased on Amazon work better than the ones I paid much more at my dentist for. I am very happy with the product and will definatly buy more because they are much more affordable on Amazon. Wish I would have know they could be purchased on Amazon before buying the pack from my dentist.</li>
