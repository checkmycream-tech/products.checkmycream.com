### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Slipper design was perfect for my elderly husband.</li>

      <li>At any rate, I just ordered two more pair.</li>
      <li>There ok .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since found a much better alternative in these [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t a problem for me of course as the person I gave these as a gift couldn&#x27;t get them to close on top.  </li>
      <li>Very comfortable and easy to get on and off even with swelling in the one foot.</li>
      <li>I purchased these slippers for my husband who has had foot surgery and required the most comfortable and adjustable shoes/slippers I could find.</li>
      <li>Easy to get on and off with husbands swollen feet.</li>
      <li>Comfortable shoe.  </li>
      <li>Found slippers to be as described in the add, fit well.</li>
      <li>Well, not bad, they set a delivery date of the 10th</li>
      <li>The vendor was kind enough to issue a full refund, and told me to just toss the slippers in the trash.</li>
      <li>We received them on time, they fit and my husband really likes them.  </li>
      <li>Arrived pretty quick.  </li>
      <li>the right keeps popping open.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not bad, and so far, I have to get use to the slippers, but they feel ok so far?</li>
      <li>Be aware first and foremost that they are NOT adjustable.  </li>
      <li>They are not stylish or really high quality, but they are functional at a good price.</li>
      <li>my husband really likes them</li>
      <li>Great for around house without socks, but very very thin, don&#x27;t expect much for the price</li>
      <li>These have moderately heavy soles, compared to many slippers, which is convenient for walking outdoors and when it is damp (not rainy/wet).  </li>
      <li>He normally takes a size large, but I ordered an extra large to allow for swelling, etc.</li>
      <li>They have no faux fur or fleece lining which tend to make my feet too hot, especially in the summer.  </li>
      <li>The first pair lasted about a year of being worn almost daily.</li>
      <li>First, they were crushed inside a bag and no amount of manipulation made them look much like slippers again.  </li>
      <li>These seemed great, but when they arrived, half of the stitching that connects the fabric to the sole was missing.</li>
      <li>These are not heavy cloth (I always wear socks with them).  </li>
      <li>Not sure how much better than regular slippers- time will tell.</li>
      <li>The most disturbing thing is that when I stuck my hand inside and lifted up against the velcro the velcro popped right open on both shoes.  </li>
      <li>I like having adjustable slippers, because I have hard to fit feet.</li>
      <li>They were still usable, but clearly would not last long.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, these slippers do not run accurate to size as the slippers would not even go onto the foot which was not swollen!</li>

<li> Apparently it is not in Dream Products policy to do so.</li>
<li> In my opinion, that is very dangerous and these are geared toward older people (most likely to fall).  </li>
<li> If you live in a cold area, heavy slippers might be better.</li>
<li> Basically the velcro just keeps the slipper closed, but there isn&#x27;t enough velcro width to do any sort of adjustment at all.</li>
<li> Smaller than expected.</li>
<li> Pity there isn&#x27;t a slightly larger size.</li>
<li> but we&#x27;ll have to see how long the bottom cushion stays cushiony.</li>
<li> Wish they would choose inside color other than white.</li>
<li> I saw a previous review that said that the Velco popped open.  </li>
<li> My order was partially backordered and that took some time.</li>
<li> You cannot adjust how loose or tight they are.  </li>
<li> The velcro inside is less than one inch wide.  </li>
<li> was such a poor one.  </li>
<li> The velcro closure is just a thin strip, which makes the adjustable feature completely useless, especially if you have bigger feet, like me.</li>
<li> Much better than these terrible slippers.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the XL is still a little tight even after some attempt at stretching.</li>
<li> tried these outside but was afraid of falling.</li>
<li> The rubber on the bottom is very slick and the materials on the side will not stand up to any sort of wear.  </li>
<li> When they arrived I was shocked at the poor quality, especially considering the price.  </li>
<li> If the wearer has any sort of swelling in their feet, these slippers will be worse then any slippers you can buy in a store.  </li>
<li> They are also made of very poor quality materials.  </li>
<li> Poor communication from seller and inaccurate sizing equals a very poor rating!</li>
<li> If that happens while someone is walking it could trip them and cause a bad fall.  </li>
<li> fell apart cheep crap</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>
<li> These slippers are awful.  </li>

    <li> Arrived pretty quick.  Comfortable shoe.  I&#x27;m going to order a second pair.</li>
    <li> very comfortable....my husband really likes them</li>
    <li> This is the second pair of these slippers that we purchased.  We received them on time, they fit and my husband really likes them.  The first pair lasted about a year of being worn almost daily.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a Christmas gift for a diabetic man age 62.  When they arrived I was shocked at the poor quality, especially considering the price.  First, they were crushed inside a bag and no amount of manipulation made them look much like slippers again.  They lacked structure and felt thin and cheap to me.  The most disturbing thing is that when I stuck my hand inside and lifted up against the velcro the velcro popped right open on both shoes.  If it pops open with just my hand lifting up what will it do when someone is walking in it?  If that happens while someone is walking it could trip them and cause a bad fall.  In my opinion, that is very dangerous and these are geared toward older people (most likely to fall).  I am returning them.</li>
    <li> I bought a pair of these about a year ago, and have been wearing them in the evening indoors almost every day.  They are not stylish or really high quality, but they are functional at a good price. Check out the prices for Velco or adjustable slippers; good quality slippers that are adjustable tend to cost about $50.  These have moderately heavy soles, compared to many slippers, which is convenient for walking outdoors and when it is damp (not rainy/wet).  The cloth top allows for machine washing and drying which is very handy when slipper start to smell. These are not heavy cloth (I always wear socks with them).  They have no faux fur or fleece lining which tend to make my feet too hot, especially in the summer.  If you live in a cold area, heavy slippers might be better. I saw a previous review that said that the Velco popped open.  I have not had that problem, and I&#x27;m a guy who is 6&#x27;1\\&quot; and 200 pounds. At any rate, I just ordered two more pair.</li>
    <li> These slippers are awful.  Be aware first and foremost that they are NOT adjustable.  The velcro inside is less than one inch wide.  You cannot adjust how loose or tight they are.  If the wearer has any sort of swelling in their feet, these slippers will be worse then any slippers you can buy in a store.  They are also made of very poor quality materials.  The rubber on the bottom is very slick and the materials on the side will not stand up to any sort of wear.  This wasn&#x27;t a problem for me of course as the person I gave these as a gift couldn&#x27;t get them to close on top.  It was embarrassing for them and for me on Christmas morning to find my gift was such a poor one.  Avoid this product if at all possible.  They also did not refund my return shipping of $6.85 cents.  Apparently it is not in Dream Products policy to do so.</li>
    <li> Slipper design was perfect for my elderly husband. Unfortunately, the XL is still a little tight even after some attempt at stretching. Pity there isn&#x27;t a slightly larger size.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  The left  will not close and the right keeps popping open.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaply made - the type of item you find in a dollar store for a buck or 2.&lt;br /&gt;I tried these outside but was afraid of falling.</li>
    <li> Great for around house without socks, but very very thin, don&#x27;t expect much for the price</li>
    <li> There ok . They will get me through the summer till i can get better ones for the winter. just what i though&lt;br /&gt;t they be.</li>
    <li> Not sure how much better than regular slippers- time will tell. Comfy but we&#x27;ll have to see how long the bottom cushion stays cushiony. Wish they would choose inside color other than white.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Easy to get on and off with husbands swollen feet.</li>
    <li> Well, not bad, they set a delivery date of the 10th and I got it on the 9th by the UPS! Not bad, and so far, I have to get use to the slippers, but they feel ok so far?</li>
    <li> I like having adjustable slippers, because I have hard to fit feet. These seemed great, but when they arrived, half of the stitching that connects the fabric to the sole was missing. They were still usable, but clearly would not last long. The velcro closure is just a thin strip, which makes the adjustable feature completely useless, especially if you have bigger feet, like me. Basically the velcro just keeps the slipper closed, but there isn&#x27;t enough velcro width to do any sort of adjustment at all. The vendor was kind enough to issue a full refund, and told me to just toss the slippers in the trash. That made me think they get these kinds of complaints often. I&#x27;ve since found a much better alternative in these [[ASIN:B001F6U0IK Foamtreads Men&#x27;s Doctor Slippers]]. They are very comfortable and fully adjustable. Much better than these terrible slippers. Glad I got a refund and bought the Foamtreads instead.</li>

He normally takes a size large, but I ordered an extra large to allow for swelling, etc. Unfortunately, these slippers do not run accurate to size as the slippers would not even go onto the foot which was not swollen! I have returned them to the seller as directed on the packaging but have not heard back and do not have evidence of a refund after 2 weeks. Poor communication from seller and inaccurate sizing equals a very poor rating!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and easy to get on and off even with swelling in the one foot.</li>
