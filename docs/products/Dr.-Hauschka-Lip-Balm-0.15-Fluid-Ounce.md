      <li>It is the best commercially available lip balm that I have found.</li>
      <li>but I can get over that because it is soooo good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather not put my fingers in a tub, but the tube just isn&#x27;t as good...</li>
      <li>so it had to be good stuff for the lips.</li>
      <li>i love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>She also said it has a nice smell.  </li>
      <li>Nice product,</li>
      <li>It does feel nice on your&lt;br /&gt;lips</li>
      <li>skin is sensitive and the Dr. Hauschka line of cosmetics has been excellent for me.  </li>
      <li>I used the product mostly at night and every morning I had to immediately apply another product to better moisturize my lips.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Our lips don&#x27;t hurt, crack, and bleed any more.</li>
      <li>I love Dr. Hauschka Lip Balm and have used it for many years.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m allergic to most lip balms, but not this</li>
      <li>The stick version is more appropriate for daytime use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Dr. H.&#x27;s lip balm is my go-to favorite for lips.</li>
      <li>First found it in the UK and loved that Amazon had it too.</li>
      <li>Super rich, smells amazing, all natural, makes my mouth happy :)</li>
      <li>you probably don&#x27;t need to spend $20 on lip gloss, but if peeling is a problem, this lip gloss will heal your lips and get them looking smooth and healthy.</li>
      <li>My lips chap easily</li>
      <li>This is my favorite Lip Balm right now!  </li>
      <li>:  Put on before bed, because so rich, it can rub off easily.  </li>
      <li>feel comfortable to use it.</li>
      <li>Now I use it every night at bedtime, and they are in great shape the next day!</li>
      <li>SO FAR SO GOOD on your balm.</li>
      <li>Jennifer Aniston said she uses it and it keeps her lips nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>After using it daily for 2 months I&#x27;m finding that my lips are not in any exceptional shape.</li>
      <li>It is so silky smooth and soft and gives a nice natural gloss.  </li>
      <li>We worth the cost.</li>
      <li>It goes on very easily and is the only product that keeps my lips from drying out/flaking in the winter.  </li>
      <li>I travel constantly and having my favorites makes me feel secure and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I have found that most lip treatments either just coat my lips with wax, or moisturize them but only for awhile.</li>
      <li>This is the first lip balm that gives us both relief and healing.</li>
      <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll order the stick more convenient for me.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time if not wasted, and honestly feels so amazing, non addictive, and leaves my lips</li>
      <li>so I was very excited to get this (just in a bigger jar) for the price!</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
      <li>I use lip liner, which drys lips fast, and I now put this stuff on after lip liner and no drying.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I like this product so much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I can&#x27;t afford much, this one item I save up for and never scrooge on.  </li>
      <li>My daughter and I both have red hair, light eyes, and all the skin sensitivities that go along with it.</li>
      <li>It is creamier and more lubricating than any other I have tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and happily, that little pot goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t care for the way it has to be applied when other products are more convenient.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s far cheaper here at Amazon than at Whole Foods, which is where I first bought it (on sale).</li>
      <li>I love it so much that now that I am in Singapore, I am ordering some so that my husband can bring it here as it is not readily available where we are.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very intensive and soft.</li>
      <li>Many products contain heavy waxes or petroleum that protect but do nothing to help cure the underlying issue.</li>
      <li>If you have normal lips</li>
      <li>I have bought, ordered, returned 15 plus different products and this one seems to be ok to far, but I prefer the stick instead of this tiny jar</li>
      <li>Then, one night I put Vaseline on my lips and by morning they were nearly healed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not every product works for everyone, but the German cosmetic companies produce way better products than any American cosmetic company produces due the policies and politics of the FDA and cosmetic approval here in the USA.</li>
      <li>The smell is a little funny</li>
      <li>I have not been using very long but so far no changes</li>

<li> The lip balm stick is easier to use versus the little jar.</li>
<li> /&gt;Plant alcohol is used as a preservative and helps firm and tone the skin.</li>
<li> is a fatty alcohol, a blend of cetyl and stearyl alcohols in a 70:30 ratio.</li>
<li> This lip balm did was a huge and expensive disappointment.  </li>
<li> I was hoping for a small miracle in a tub.  </li>
<li> ( it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the small amount u get).</li>
<li> I switched from Origins, which was sold and marketed as a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; line, but still had some very questionable ingredients and never looked back.  </li>
<li> Very small amount for the price.</li>
<li> It made my chapped lips worse.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad; it&#x27;s slightly floral if anything and doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all.</li>
<li> This is a fake one!</li>
<li> their all bad for the lips in my opinion.</li>
<li> I hate Blistex, Vaseline, Carmex, and Boots no.7</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I travel constantly and having my favorites makes me feel secure and comfortable. Dr. H.&#x27;s lip balm is my go-to favorite for lips. Not sticky, smells heavenly, smooths and puts on a gloss.  I&#x27;d rather not put my fingers in a tub, but the tube just isn&#x27;t as good...My lips chap easily and I keep this by my bed as well as in my purse.  The only time I think about it is if I forget to bring it along...and then I&#x27;m out searching for it!</li>
    <li> This is a fake one! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Hauschka Lip Balm and have used it for many years.  It is creamier and more lubricating than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have found that most lip treatments either just coat my lips with wax, or moisturize them but only for awhile. Dr Haushka&#x27;s lip treatment actually healed my rough, dry lips. Now I use it every night at bedtime, and they are in great shape the next day! I have purchased this product several times, and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s soooothing, smoothing, and not drying the lips out. I have bought, ordered, returned 15 plus different products and this one seems to be ok to far, but I prefer the stick instead of this tiny jar( it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the small amount u get). Next time, I&#x27;ll order the stick more convenient for me.  I got mine on 1-15-14. It got 5 star reviews so it had to be good stuff for the lips. I hate Blistex, Vaseline, Carmex, and Boots no.7 their all bad for the lips in my opinion. SO FAR SO GOOD on your balm. It&#x27;s very intensive and soft. I have dry lips so I was very excited to get this (just in a bigger jar) for the price! Thank You for making this so intensive.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably keep ordering  this one(just in the stick).</li>
    <li> It is the best lip balm I have ever used.  It lasts and hydrates.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out like other lip gloss.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I received it in a beauty box sub and have been peeling the skin off my lips (symptom of my stress and anxiety) and I apply it overnight and BAM! Healed.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but I now understand the reviews from people who wrote that this dries their lips out! I think it helped solve the cracking I was experiencing (hence the three stars) but my lips felt dry after using the product, every time. I used the product mostly at night and every morning I had to immediately apply another product to better moisturize my lips. Next time I think I&#x27;ll stick to my go-to balm.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a small miracle in a tub.  It&#x27;s just ok.  I get better&lt;br /&gt;results putting my body lotion  (cera ve) on at night.  I think most&lt;br /&gt;lip balms can produce the same results.  It does feel nice on your&lt;br /&gt;lips when you put it on.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in people mag.  Jennifer Aniston said she uses it and it keeps her lips nice and soft.  She also said it has a nice smell.  I have not been using very long but so far no changes and I do not care for the smell at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t heal chap lips. Once applied didn&#x27;t last long at all. Very small amount for the price.Would never buy it again. Would never recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times since I ordered it from Amazon. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other products I&#x27;ve tried. Yes, it softens, but I wish it had another way to apply rather than using a finger or other applicator. It also seems to have a \\&quot;granular\\&quot; feel as compared to other products I&#x27;ve used/am using. It may be a good product. I just don&#x27;t care for the way it has to be applied when other products are more convenient.</li>
    <li> The lip balm stick is easier to use versus the little jar.</li>
    <li> 1: I&#x27;m allergic to most lip balms, but not this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:  A little bit goes a long way.  Super rich, smells amazing, all natural, makes my mouth happy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  Put on before bed, because so rich, it can rub off easily.  The stick version is more appropriate for daytime use.  Although that one is not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I can&#x27;t afford much, this one item I save up for and never scrooge on.  It lasts a long time if not wasted, and honestly feels so amazing, non addictive, and leaves my lips youthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST STUFF EVER!!</li>
    <li> I have been a dedicated customer of the Dr. Hauschka line of products for the past ten years.  I switched from Origins, which was sold and marketed as a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; line, but still had some very questionable ingredients and never looked back.  I absolutely love Dr. Hauschka products for their purity and wonderful scents.  I received the lip balm as a bonus with a regular purchase and contrary to other reviewers, it works well for me.  Some reviewers complained about the alcohol content, but there are various types of alcohols and the one contained in this product is not the drying type...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant alcohol is used as a preservative and helps firm and tone the skin. It is derived from fermentation of fruit, maize and potatoes. The quantities of alcohol in the Dr.Hauschka preparations are not sufficient to dry out the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is a fatty alcohol, a blend of cetyl and stearyl alcohols in a 70:30 ratio. It is a solid, white, wax like substance. It is used for consistency and as a stabiliser. They are derived from coconut oil and palm oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and the Dr. Hauschka line of cosmetics has been excellent for me.  Their lipstick is totally non drying and lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every product works for everyone, but the German cosmetic companies produce way better products than any American cosmetic company produces due the policies and politics of the FDA and cosmetic approval here in the USA.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. We worth the cost. The smell is a little funny but I can get over that because it is soooo good.</li>
    <li> I like this accept for the taste.</li>
    <li> I too could not use this lip balm because it actually gave me chapped lips.  I kept applying it thinking eventually it would work.  Then, one night I put Vaseline on my lips and by morning they were nearly healed.  I now put Vaseline on my lips each evening and they are healed and moist.</li>
    <li> Not waxy enough, seemed to travel onto my face.</li>
    <li> This lip balm did was a huge and expensive disappointment.  It made my chapped lips worse.  Definitely don&#x27;t recommend purchasing.  A big rip off.</li>
    <li> This lib balm is excellent for chapped and peeling lips. If you have normal lips you probably don&#x27;t need to spend $20 on lip gloss, but if peeling is a problem, this lip gloss will heal your lips and get them looking smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hauschka lip balm for several years now and since I started using it I do not bother to look for any other product. It is the best lip balm I ever had used.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Keeps my lips moist and prevents cracking.  I use lip liner, which drys lips fast, and I now put this stuff on after lip liner and no drying.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  First found it in the UK and loved that Amazon had it too.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is a little on the pricey side, especially for the amount you get. After using it daily for 2 months I&#x27;m finding that my lips are not in any exceptional shape. Save your money and get the [[ASIN:B009I4PRI4 Rosebud Salve Tin, .8 Ounce]] instead.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Lip Balm right now!  It is so silky smooth and soft and gives a nice natural gloss.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is pricey, but it&#x27;s also the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.  I keep it in my car, where it melts in the summer but who cares, since it&#x27;s in a pot.  It goes on very easily and is the only product that keeps my lips from drying out/flaking in the winter.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and happily, that little pot goes a long way.  It&#x27;s far cheaper here at Amazon than at Whole Foods, which is where I first bought it (on sale).</li>
    <li> I first bought this product from an EcoPlaza in the Netherlands and at the time I was pretty doubtful that it could be worth the cost. Then, I used it. It is the best commercially available lip balm that I have found. I love it so much that now that I am in Singapore, I am ordering some so that my husband can bring it here as it is not readily available where we are.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have red hair, light eyes, and all the skin sensitivities that go along with it. So when I say we have dry, chapped lips, especially in the winter, I mean it. In addition to this she plays oboe in band and battles constant chapping, or musician&#x27;s mouth (as we call it). This is the first lip balm that gives us both relief and healing. Many products contain heavy waxes or petroleum that protect but do nothing to help cure the underlying issue. That&#x27;s why I like this product so much. It is expensive but worth it because it works. I am surprised at negative reviews because it has been the only thing that has soothed deep cracks without stinging. It is not addictive - unless you choose to use it often because it works as a barrier and healer. We use it twice at day - morning and night. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad; it&#x27;s slightly floral if anything and doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all. Stores like Earth Fare sell it at the $20 price point so getting it on Amazon for around $10 is a good deal. And it doesn&#x27;t take much. You get what you pay for, and I will pay for this again because the value overrides the price. Our lips don&#x27;t hurt, crack, and bleed any more. Enough said.</li>
    <li> i love it! feel comfortable to use it.</li>
