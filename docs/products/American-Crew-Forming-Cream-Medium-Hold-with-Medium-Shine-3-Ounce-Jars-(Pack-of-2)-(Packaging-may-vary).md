<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as described - medium hold with medium shine.  I recommend only using it while your hair is wet.  It combs through and is much more even when wet.  Don&#x27;t forget to comb through it after it dries.  That makes it look more natural (less wet).  It takes about 20 minutes for it to fully dry out so that you can comb through and really get a more natural look (at least it does for me).</li>
    <li> Love it. It helps my 70+ hair to look thicker.</li>
    <li> Best hair product out there</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product. I have wavy/curlier, thick hair and this helps keep it slicked back without looking like I&#x27;m trying too hard. Keeps your hair in the general area that you intended, not frozen in place.</li>
    <li> This stuff holds up in all conditions and lasts for a long time, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for long hair as it will likely weigh down and make your hair look flat.  But if you have short/medium hair and like some style or spiking this stuff is awesome.  You&#x27;ll want to wash it out before bed otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with product on your pillows and sensitive skin types may have breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff my husband will use!  I am so glad I found it on Amazon!  I don&#x27;t have to search in local stores and be overcharged!</li>
    <li> I have used forming cream for my hair at both short and medium lengths. I find that this product is very versatile. When used on damp hair, it lends to slick-looking hairstyles. When applied to dry hair, it adds pliability to the hair without excess shine. I have used more expensive hair products before but have yet to find a reason to step away from American Crew.</li>
    <li> Been looking for this product on line as purchasing it from the hair salon gets expensive.  For my taste, it holds well, smells great, and I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with shoulder-length, curly hair that gets absolutely wild if I don&#x27;t put some product in it.    I&#x27;ve tried everything, from mousse to gel to hairspray to all kinds of creams, and this product is without a doubt the best.    It isn&#x27;t sticky, it doesn&#x27;t give your hair that \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feel, it smells nice, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair so that it ends up straight. It also washes out really well - some of the stuff I&#x27;ve tried seemed to hang on in the shower.    My only complaint is the price vs quantity ratio - this stuff is pretty expensive. I&#x27;ve learned, though, that it only takes a small amount to give the right amount of control. You don&#x27;t need as much as you think.    Overall, I really like this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Latino with very thick and wavy hair.  I like to grow it long, but not too long because I&#x27;ve found NO hair product that can keep it kempt throughout the day.  As such, the perfect length for my hair has already been discovered, but the hair product has varied from time to time for my medium-to-long hair.  In my early teens I used a gel that had an apple logo on it, smelled like apples, but for the life of me can&#x27;t remember the name.  It&#x27;s been long since discontinued, and I then moved on to Got2B Glued.  I thought that was the perfect hair-keeper, and even still have a tube in my medicine cabinet after ten years of using the product.  However, I knew that it would get flaky when I ran my hands through it, and it wasn&#x27;t very good when my hair got longer, but I didn&#x27;t think of switching until my fiancee (then girlfriend) frequented her fingers through my hair more and more (don&#x27;t get any wrong ideas).  I realized that I needed something that could hold my hair through thick and thin, and I ventured into American Crew and Redken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, it&#x27;s a toss-up between the two, but I can say without a doubt that the American Crew Forming Cream is magnificent, and has so far kept true in my hair&#x27;s many different lengths and styles.  Strength and rigidity depends on how much you use, but I&#x27;ve experienced no such flakiness thus far, and it can easily be removed with some water (unlike many other hair products where removal can only happen with a heavy shower).  The smell is great, and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily describe it as \\&quot;girly\\&quot;; it has a wonderful masculine scent, and I often look forward to putting it on just for the smell alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I like both the Redken and American Crew creams, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be giving up any of the two any time soon, so I highly recommend the American Crew Forming Cream for short to medium-long (like, just above the eyebrows) hair.  It even works great on my thick, wavy Mexican hair!</li>
    <li> I got this once based on past reviews and got hooked.    As advertised, it holds without getting or looking sticky, and it smells great.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it unless I find something better (hard to find).</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommends these products, i have used several of them....while they are a little pricey, they do last for a long time. My hair is between gray and (mostly) white. It acts differently than it used to. This forming cream makes it stay the way I make it in the morning and will not get away from me through the day. I am in sales so I prefer not to appear to someone like I just came out of a wind tunnel. I have been purchasing this from my stylist,without regrets to the price, but when i can get two for one.....I&#x27;m in.  For what its worth , two of these will last me most of the year.</li>
    <li> I had been using a type of putty to gel my hair, but I couldn&#x27;t find that product at a reasonable price.  My summer internship was starting soon so I ordered Crew and hoped for the best.  I was really happy with the product, it is cheaper on Amazon then in stores where I have seen it.  It holds very well and it is not too greasy.  It applies to my hair very easily and I would highly recommend it, I am a fan.</li>
    <li> I love products from American Crew, however this product smells a lot and makes your hair feel heavier. Primary reason for not buying again would be the weird smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product for when I have short or long hair.  For more shine, I add more water, for a more natural look, less water.  I&#x27;m always changing my look every day, using more or less of the product.  It lasts throughout the day &amp; can be reshaped throughout the day if needed. Hair will shift if it&#x27;s long or I don&#x27;t use a lot, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> Same as you get at the salon, just much better prices here at Amazon.  It holds well, but does not stiffen.  Exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> Works as well as you would expect forming cream to. It is waxy and keeps short, thick hair in place for the whole day.</li>
    <li> The description does not say whether this is strong or medium. I ordered this thinking that it is strong but received medium; had to return it. The medium does not hold your hair</li>
    <li> My boyfriend would order cases of this stuff if he could. He likes it because it creates a long-lasting hold but is not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; or hard to the touch. It smells nice too and you can tell its a quality product because it lasts all day long without fail! It is a little pricey, but trust me, it&#x27;s worth the money! (I may have used this on myself one or two or five times :) ).</li>
    <li> This thing is like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) put in hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) talk to girls.&lt;br /&gt;3) wake up in her bed the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all about the American Crew</li>
    <li> Been buying this stuff for years.  Best cream I have ever used and smells fine. Super hold and you use very little of it at a time.</li>
    <li> This is not hair glue - it stays pliable pretty much all day and it works best if your hair isn&#x27;t particularly long (at least in the volume that I would like to use on a daily basis).  That said, I personally think it smells loads better than most of the competitors and I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t turn your hair into a plasticy shell as seems to be the case with many gels.  My only issue is the cost (it&#x27;s ~$17 a jar in stores), but buying it in 2-packs through Amazon makes it reasonable enough...</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and the vast majority of the products I&#x27;ve tried either made my hair into a hard shell or would give me hold for a couple hours at most. With this product my hair stays soft and workable all day. I find that I need to use a little more than the pea sized potion some other reviews have stated but not so much that these jars won&#x27;t last me a long time. All in all a very good product at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great styling product. I like the matte finish. It holds my hair in place without looking or feeling greasy or shiny. Very easy to apply. If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t want to spend any time styling your hair, but want to throw in some product so you don&#x27;t look messy, this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> The cream itself is great.... but it smells exactly like coconut!  Would be OK if you are a girl but this is a cream for guys.</li>
    <li> This product was too shiny and makes hair appear greasy. Otherwise I like it.</li>
    <li> I must say that I&#x27;ve used this for years now and I&#x27;d really like to continue to do so (may have to stock up on it). I&#x27;m sure that some day soon, they&#x27;ll discontinue it, though. Anyway, it&#x27;s got the best of all worlds in my opinion because it gives me strength without a sick, waxy feeling AND it smells decent, AND I only need a little bit each morning because it really goes a long way.    The only problem I have with it is that I need it every day or my head looks like a lop-sided, dirty Q-tip!    &#x27;Form&#x27; your own opinion, but give it a try!</li>
    <li> American Crew was initially recommended to me by my barber as a non-shiny product to keep my hair in line.  Being someone who has never liked putting anything into my hair I was hesitant to use it at first. I now realize that I should have been using this all along.  It doesn&#x27;t look greasy or sticky, and it helps me maintain a professional, groomed look all day.  The price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat and is about half of what it is at my Barber.</li>
    <li> American crew has become the standard for men&#x27;s hair styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Good for short to medium length hair&lt;br /&gt;+Not too messy to apply&lt;br /&gt;+Doesn&#x27;t have a powerful scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with subscribe and save you are still paying at least $10 for a container.  That&#x27;s a lot for a pile of glop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Does the job, makes it look natural.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey though.  It also smells like a barber shop.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a crazy smell and works really well with wet hair.  There is no really greasy look to it.  But I&#x27;m sure there is something better out there.</li>
    <li> I received this back when it was hotter here in California. The forming cream was really runny until it cooled down. Aside from that it is really good at what it does. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, and gives it a natural shine. The only thing I did not like at first was the fragrance. Sort of smells like sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Ok, so a friend suggested I try this. I&#x27;m beginning to go a little bald and have very thin hair. I have avoided gels, creams and hairspray because it looks too shiny or causes flakes. Well this product is amazing. Not shiny and no flakes and I appear to be a little less bald because it reduces light going to my scalp.  Also the price is amazing. At wally world it&#x27;s $18 for 3 ounces, on amazon it&#x27;s $22 for 6 ounces.</li>
    <li> Product came as advertised and on time.  I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that has a really strong hold and will hold short hair in place without looking too greasy or wet.</li>
    <li> Works best for me.  Good hold while providing some flexibility.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell and isn&#x27;t sticky.  It does the job so well, you apply and forget about it.  Isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about?</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product I use now. I don&#x27;t use anything else. I love it. Very good deal. They usually go for about $15-$16 at local hair salons. Also I got free 2-day shipping with a trial prime membership.</li>
    <li> By far this is the best foamning cream..it smells great (not girly), it feels good, it leave your hair shiny but not too much and it feels good. By far the best product of AMERICAN CREW. If you are tired of your gel, I will recommend you to give it a try you will like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders and lasts all day.  I&#x27;ve been searching a long time for the right balance, and like it says there is medium hold and shine so that it isn&#x27;t overpowering but looks clean and professional.  I have found, and was told at the barbershop, that it works best for guys when it is applied on dry or nearly-dry hair.  Great for wavy and curly hair, also.  Smells really good, and gives hold without making your hair hard and brittle.  Has a slight wax feel to keep hair in place, but not oily at all.  I&#x27;m sold on it, ordered two 3 oz. jars.</li>
    <li> Great product. I recommend using it when hair is slightly still wet.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing.  best subtle to strong hold product you can buy.  changes the entire appearance between wet and dry application.  i recomend semi wet/dry... but who am i.  Love the product, and Amazon allows you to save on the product while having it delivered to your door.... Amazing.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this product works great.  It keeps my hair in place without looking too shiny or sticky.</li>
    <li> I looked through quite a few brands and types of molding/forming creams on Amazon and finally decided to go with a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream does not create lumps or flakes on your hair like hair gels do.  It keeps your style strong yet flexible and lasts at least 8 hours (I used this cream every day 9 to 5).  The fragrance smells rich and manly.  The title says that it has medium shine, but as far as I can tell, this cream does not add any shine unless you use half bottle, which I&#x27;ve never tried to do that.  Since it&#x27;s medium hold, it&#x27;s good for short hair.  I went through a jar faster with long hair and noticed it&#x27;s strong enough to keep my hair volume under control but does not keep style in shape at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, American Crew is one of the higher end hair styling products and after a year of use, I like it.</li>
    <li> I have used forming cream for three years now, and I can find nothing that rivals it. My hair stays solid throughout the day. The cream is easy to manage when you apply it. It even smells nice.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d switch from my usual Tigi B For Men Pure Texture Molding Paste just to jazz things up. The American Crew Forming Cream is relatively greasy and has a strong \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; smell. It does an OK job holding my thick, wavey, long-ish \\&quot;surfer dude\\&quot; type hair in place but that&#x27;s about it. It doesn&#x27;t last and the greasy feel is hard to wash off. Ounce for ounce, the Tigi Molding Paste is better value as you need to use less and it keeps my stubborn hair in check all day, even in the summer. It&#x27;s not greasy and has a high-end, professional-grade masculine fragrance that goes away after a while (perfect for guys like me who don&#x27;t like wearing any fragrance). As for shine, the AC product doesn&#x27;t add any, nor does it mattify. I prefer the matte look for my textured style so this is where the Tigi product works better.</li>
    <li> As expected! It is definitely American Crew product. If you haven&#x27;t used their products before you can expect a lot better grade than you can with other grocery store brands. I.e. Axe, Suave etc...</li>
    <li> This product is worth every cent. Just a dab will hold &amp; style your hair without the stickiness. If you use alot it will feel too thick and sticky.The scent is a light pleasant barber smell lotion.I recommend this product without reservation.</li>
    <li> This seems to be the only cream that makes me look like a gentleman. A little pricey, but worth it. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 15 years now. Won&#x27;t change to anything else. My barber even asked what I use - when I told him, he told me it&#x27;s the only stuff he&#x27;ll sell out of his shop.</li>
    <li> Good product with a great price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this product because its so easy to use. Just get a little bit on your fingertips and rub it in your hair dry or wet. Easy to mold on the go too. 10/10</li>
    <li> Ever since turning 40, my hair has been getting more \\&quot;straw like\\&quot; over time.  I&#x27;ve been using hair gels for quite a while, and getting more frustrated with the results from it each year.  I tried this product on a recommendation from my stylist, and I must say, I am very pleased with the results.      I have collar length, wavy, thick hair, that tends to become uncontrollable rather quickly.  Gels work OK, but I hat the slick look, and iron like feel, LOL.  AC Forming Cream has worked wonders in a number of ways.  One, it is very easy to work with.  I&#x27;ve been using roughly a dime sized amount worked through my hair, and it leaves it fairly soft, yet very manageable.  Never stiff, never \\&quot;wet\\&quot; looking etc.  It also smells great, and, after only a few days of use, appears to be removing that \\&quot;straw like\\&quot; feeling I mentioned earlier.      As a side note, it washes out very easily, and allows shampoo to foam without using an entire bottle at a time, just to get it out of your hair.    Great product, at a great price here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Tried and true product. My husband has used this for over 15 years and now our teenage son uses it too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products in my hair over the years, hair spray, mousse, gel (of various holds), pomade, etc. Out of those the one that I liked best was the pomade but that had a tendency to get slick and gooey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years back the gal that cuts my hair recommended this stuff and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy, holds your hair in place without making it into a hair helmet and doesn&#x27;t shed gel bits. If it has a scent, I haven&#x27;t really noticed it. A little bit goes a long way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback that I can think of is that the stuff can get a little gooey over time in the container. However once it&#x27;s in my hair then it&#x27;s back to normal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is stuff better than this I don&#x27;t know about it. </li>
    <li> My hair stylest turned me on to this product after years of using gel/mousse on my short \\&quot;spikey\\&quot; hair.  Must be popular as my stylest can&#x27;t keep this stuff on the shelf hence me ordering off Amazon for nearly half the cost!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great for my hair. I have very fine, short blonde hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find a middle-ground between a nice hold and having the hair still look natural. I have to use about a penny sized amount to style my hair; I like wearing the faux hawk style so it takes a bit more cream than normal. After application my hair looks almost as if I was born with it the way I styled it, it is VERY natural looking. Personally, I love the way this stuff smells, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter because the scent is so faint that it will NOT interfere with cologne or aftershave. Unlike other products I have used (Axe Whatever Messy Look, Got2B, and different types of hair gel) this one delivers consistent results. The only con I can think of is the retail price of this stuff ($16.99 at my local drug stores and salons), but you basically get two for the price of one on Amazon so it&#x27;s just an overall great deal.</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot, but the only way to get the price down is to auto order.  I prefer the Citrus Mint Paste, but couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon.  This is a good product that allows flexibility in the hair style that looks natural and lasts all day.  May have to use more than instructions say, depending on style chosen.  I have been using it for more than a year straight.</li>
    <li> love this product! it is not too heavy and is just enough to get the desired look i am looking for!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t personally like the forming cream very much.  You have to use way more of it than some of American Crew&#x27;s other products for one.  Second, I have blondish hair and it always makes it look dark and greasy.  The hold is pretty good but it washes out easily with water so its not great for sports where you sweat.</li>
    <li> It is my preferred for medium hold and medium shine!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and I can&#x27;t get the same quality hair product in anything cheaper. Has a nice smell and lasts for a while in your hair.</li>
    <li> Great price. Came fast. Would buy again. Better than buying in store great deal for the product. This is a good hair product. Legit</li>
    <li> Matte finish, keep the frizz at bay.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the grocery store and shipped to my door. What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> By far the best hair product on the market. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth the money. It makes my hair look great without making it stiff. I think it offers a more mature alternate than some of the other products out there like Axe, which I think is more for somebody in their 20s. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years now and plan to continue doing so. Great value!</li>
    <li> This is great if you have short hair, or like to spike your hair. It hold very well, and seems to be good quality. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff,a small amount keeps my hair in place all day.The hair salon charges about double the price.</li>
    <li> I have black, thicker, short hair which I usually groom with my hands everyday (rarely use comb). The forming crew works good for grooming and styling. It is not greasy, it does not leave the waxed look and it does not give a wet look either. The hair stays in set style throughout the day (unless you roll on the floor and play with your dog) which is great! It however still leaves my scalp a little itchy at the end of day. Probably not the ideal product for dry hair/scalp. I alternate this with leave-in moisturizer everyday.</li>
    <li> Smells like old woman&#x27;s cosmetics. Low hold and makes hair shiny. I hated it and returned to the store.....not recommended</li>
    <li> just the right amount of hold and friz reduction, goes on easy, feels great all day, this will last me months</li>
    <li> American Crew Forming Cream has a gentle manly fragrance. It gives a dull shine and a mild hold to the hair sobthe hair retain their natural look.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this religiously as he has tried SO many other products and find that the texture just isn&#x27;t the same. This is the perfect hold and shine without being too greasy. It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair matted and greasy or chalky by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Considerably cheaper to get on Amazon than from the salon.  Beware - can be sticky and clumpy if you use with wet hands or on wet hair.</li>
    <li> item was received in a timely manner. unfortunately, i have not quite run out of my old one and this one remains sealed and unopened.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product. I apply it with wet hair, just a dollop will do. Too much leaves your hair greasy, of course. And after a long day or if I was wearing a hat (even after waking up if I applied it late night), just a little water will help it rebound and look casual again.</li>
    <li> Have always used this product in my hair. Whenever I&#x27;ve ran out I tried various other brands in the meantime and was never as satisfied with them as I am with this. Easy to use and perfect for my style of hair and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy. This company has my loyalty for life!</li>
    <li> Great value! I have purchased this product in beauty shops and grocery stores and the average cost was $16 plus dollars!I I have used&lt;br /&gt;crew forming cream for years. I have thick hair, and the hold is perfect. Non greasy,last all day.</li>
    <li> When I ordered the product, I received two pucks labeled &amp;#34;Forming Cream.&amp;#34; However, one of the containers did not contain the right product, it was filled with something that looked more like the &amp;#34;Fiber&amp;#34; product made by American Crew. Don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mostly gray hair for years (started going gray in HS), and it has gone from &#x27;wavy&#x27; to &#x27;wiry&#x27; over time.  I&#x27;ve used American Crew Grooming Cream for years and years.  I&#x27;m not even sure how I found it, probably on the recommendation of a hair stylist.  Great hold and durability.  The one thing I did not like about it was that, unless I used a really small amount, it made my hair feel greasy and/or gave me &#x27;bullet head&#x27;.  So, when I finally used up the last of a container that was several years old, I looked around for an alternative.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to try the Forming Cream, instead.  Boy, am I glad I did.  For me, this is a MUCH better product.  It provides great hold with no added shine, it is much easier to work with, and the results, while still keeping my hair neat all day, look more natural.  As an added bonus, after application, it just rinses of of my hands with running water.  With the Grooming Cream I had to use soap and water and there was still a residue that had to wear off.  I use a little bit more of the forming Cream per application, but it is still a very small amount (pea-sized), and the container will last a long time, so it remains a great bargain.  The 2-pack is an even better value, although I got mine for only $21.95 last week, so it looks like they had a price increase.  Still a value.  One more bonus is that, because it rinses out easily in the shower, I now use less shampoo to get suds.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my hair, holds well and doesn&#x27;t show that I have product in my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It served me well for several months, but I switched to Paul Mitchell Clean Cut on the recommendation of my barber. Both products work well, but the Paul Mitchell has a tiny bit more hold. By the way, I do a side part comb over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.  Has a good balance of hold + give to it.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> comes just like it would from the store, but for a portion of the price</li>
    <li> Any personal product like this is just that, personal - opinions will vary widely.  However, if you are looking for a leave in hair product that can simply add volume and a bit of shine this will do the job.  Use a bit more and it behaves more like a gel.  Because it&#x27;s a cream the consistency is more like thick sour cream than the water gels or the hard waxy products.  It goes on easy, quick clean up and cheaper on Amazon than in the barbers/salons.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product without the hardening of your hair. I have typically unruly hair and this product kept it all relaxed and held in place all day. I will be using this product on a regular basis! Totally satisfied. Product arrived on schedule and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for many years but for the last 1 year my hair is falling little. May be it is to do with my age *smiles*.</li>
    <li> Great for shorter but frizzy hair like mine. Doesnt make your hair rock hard like gel, only gives it the hold and shine. Also much cheaper to buy online (and in a 2 pack) than at a hair cutting place.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing it gives you the flexibility of being able to fix your hair but it still holds up.  my one jar has lasted over a year because you only need a little bit.</li>
    <li> American Crew Forming Cream gives a good hold and decent shine, and lasts all day. I like it a lot better than American Crew Fiber.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best forming creams. It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair too stiff or sticky. It keeps a natural look, in fact it doesn&#x27;t even seem like your wearing anything.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for mens hair.  I have tried many products and this is the best by far.  The amazon price is much cheaper than getting it at my hair salon.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best deal around; no one else is even close in price- and it&#x27;s delivery directly to me.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing. Even though it&#x27;s pricey it probably costs about the same as the $3 stuff that&#x27;s watered way down.</li>
    <li> A little oily feeling but soft to the touch, applies easily.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Not too crunchy like gel but still stays kind of wet looking.  Smells nice and manly.</li>
    <li> I have thicker hair about 6-8 inches in length and this is the only product that will tame my hair and make it presentable. I am a guy and need to look professional and not have puffed out and frizzy hair- this controls that and gives it a nice shine ( but it&#x27;s not mat nor high gloss, it is in between- just right) also smells great, so your partner will enjoy.</li>
    <li> I always have a hard time finding this specific Crew product and when I do the price is sometimes DOUBLE what I purchased this for on Amazon this time</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this daily for a couple of years now.  It works great at keeping short hair in place without being sticky or having a strong odor.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crew Forming Cream for years. I love the way it holds without looking &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; (although you can achieve that look by applying it to wet hair), and the smell is pleasant to me. The price at Amazon is typically better than my local barbershop, so I buy it here.</li>
    <li> Always comes well packaged and it has a nice medium to light hold that is better for shorter hair.  It does dry with more a wet look so you might want to try a fiber product for the dry look.</li>
    <li> About me: medium length, thick, brown hair. Product works great as I don&#x27;t need a lot of help throughout the day since my thick hair holds its place pretty well. Highly recommend using with damp hair as the cream will spread farther and more evenly. Hold&#x27;s great throughout the entire day without an obvious shine (at low volume application). 4 stars because although it works well, I feel like I could find a better product to suit me. This will likely come at a higher cost though.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for years.  It is the perfect combination of hold and cream.  It doesn&#x27;t get too stiff but it still holds his hair in place.  I really love the smell too.  It isn&#x27;t too perfumy or obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy.  I totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair cream. I have short hair that I spike in the front. It does the job in holding it up without to much firmness and shine. It does make my hair a little stiff but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice. Almost like baby power. Not strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is very soft and easy to work into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than aveda&#x27;s grooming clay because of the smell and the fact that it doesnt dry up as much as the aveda. The aveda is better at being able to restyle without starting over, but I usually don&#x27;t need to do this. Its also usually about half the price of the grooming clay. I am going to try American crew clay next to compare them all.</li>
    <li> I usually use American Crew Pomade, but tried Forming Cream when my stylist ran out of the Pomade.  It&#x27;s a little harder to work than the Pomade, but it holds noticeably firmer.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with either.  The scent is nice, and the hold is great.  If you&#x27;re finding that Pomade isn&#x27;t quite enough, but you don&#x27;t want to use crispy gel...then this is your product!</li>
    <li> I started cutting my hair short so I don&#x27;t get to use this often but when it grows out this stuff is fantastic.</li>
    <li> You get two at Amazon for the price of one at Wmart. The product is great, been using it for years. Keeps your hair right where it belongs without looking greasy or wet. Us old guys appreciate that.</li>
    <li> This stuff works perfectly for me. I have a &#x27;high and tight&#x27; haircut and comb from my left to right every day. A generous dab on damp hair gets the job done perfectly, holds all day long, and doesn&#x27;t drip or produce any white residue when I sweat.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Beats out Bed Head!</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can purchase this product.  They do not sell it in the store or beauty salons in my area even where I used to purchase it.  I love it! It works great on my short hair.  I have never found a product to replace it and believe you me I have spent lots of $$ trying other brands and nothing compares to American Crew Forming Cream, Medium Hold with Medium Shine.  Best price too!  Can&#x27;t beat it! Thank you for having this available.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this stuff years ago. Perfect amount of hold for my faux-hawk, without being to greasy, hard, or crunchy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about ten years now.  Having tried other products such as Bed Head, Redken, Garnier; I always go back to AC&#x27;s Forming Cream for a good \\&quot;hair day.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve also tried AC&#x27;s other hair products such as Fiber and Wax but found that they don&#x27;t work with my hair type and hair style: medium-length, straight, thick, black hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great for short spiky hair. Whether you are a man or a woman. It lasts all day and holds great!</li>
    <li> Great product for thinning hair.  Holds it in place.</li>
    <li> Item was great and exactly the same as buying at any salon or department store.  Would definitively use this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best hair product I&#x27;ve found for my short, coarse hair. Good hold and texture, lasts all day, no white flaky stuff, not shiny, only need a little so it lasts a long time. Amazon also sells it for WAY less than you can find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Keeps your unruly hair firmly in place. Brightly reconnend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like spending money on &amp;#34;beauty products&amp;#34;.  Let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;d rather have face paint on decked out in camo.  But when I need to look good, this is a great product.  I love the smell and it holds very well without being stiff.  In the middle of the day I can even tweak the look of my hair.  Been using this product for several years and it&#x27;s the only hair product I&#x27;ll actually spend more than  few bucks on.  American crew is legit...just wish I could afford their other products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase. It arrived on time and it was packed well. I could not have been happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily for styling my hair, and have been using it for over a year. You don&#x27;t have to use much, just enough to cover 1-2 finger tips. The cream provides nice ability to style with a medium hold, so your hair doesn&#x27;t appear heavily styled even if touched. The cream also leaves no type of residue like others might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: wash this product out of your hair after each use. It can make your hair itchy after &amp;#62; 12-16 hours. This sounds like a good policy for any hair product, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are currently using a gel or paste that has too much hold, I would definitely recommend trying this product out!</li>
    <li> it holds like pomade without the greasiness.  I love it, and smells decent.  kinda pricy in stores (target)</li>
    <li> Good product as usual!</li>
    <li> I have tried using pomades, creams, gels, and sprays from just about every manufacturer. It is not my goal to convince you that none of those products worked, or that they were a waste of money. Every one of them worked well in their own right, but I wasn&#x27;t always pleased with my personal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the American Crew Forming Cream a shot about a year ago - and it&#x27;s been my go-to product ever since. It applies well with both wet and dry hair, meaning you don&#x27;t have to wait for your hair to dry - or apply it before your hair dries out. (I found it works best with lightly damp hair after a shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives my hair a relatively strong hold, that loosens up throughout the day. Many products leave you with &#x27;helmet hair&#x27; turning your hair into a fossil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It naturally breaks down by the end of the day - I fall asleep with it in (since I shower in the mornings), and I don&#x27;t feel greasy or gross when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While spendy, these little 3-oz jars of cream will last me about 3 to 4 months - with generous applications. The Amazon&#x27;s two-pack saves you approximately 3-4 dollars over retail department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any reason why I&#x27;d buy anything else. This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> BACKGROUND&lt;br /&gt;I recently left the service of the US Army and have been granted the ability to finally grow out hair. I tried hair gels but realized that I dislike the stiffness the products provide as well as the fact they tend to causing flaking and, if my hair is messed up, the gel is a one shot deal where now my hair has lost its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair stylist recommended I test out and try some of the products from American Crew. I tested both [[ASIN:B001EWF2EM American Crew Pomade Medium Hold &amp; High Shine]] as well as the [[ASIN:B001EWF2F6 American Crew Forming Cream with Medium Hold &amp; Medium Shine]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a 2 pack. The small tubs that resemble acne pad containers came wrapped together on a single piece of cardboard. I worried because I live in the state of Texas and was afraid the hair products would melt in the heat but it was not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USEAGE&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to note is that very little hair product is needed. It is best to use only the size of a dime on your fingertips. Rub your fingertips together then gently run into your hair starting in the back moving forward. Only do a few passthroughs. Do not rub into the roots of your hair. Also, make sure your hair is towel dried so that is no longer dripping but slightly damp but not too much to where your hair is now bone dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American Crew products have a scent.

    <li> I have been using this product for several years now and I love it. I signed up for the \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; option here on Amazon about 6 months ago and up until last month things have been fine. This last month I noticed a charge on my credit card for 18.65 which is what I had been paying for the subscribe and save but it was about 3 weeks early. I contacted Amazon and the lady apologized and said that my order was shipped out early due to a glitch in their system. She didnt offer my any sort of compensation but fortunatly the account used to pay for this had enough money in it. When the package arrived I noticed that they are 3oz jars instead of the 3.53oz jars I had been receiving. The description of the forming cream said it was a medium hold instead of a firm hold like the other ones I have received from Amazon. Needless to say I canceled my subscription until they can get this corrected.</li>
    <li> Works great (for my short to medium length hair).  Best I&#x27;ve tried in reshape after wearing headphones or hoodies.    Pretty good value as well, since a couple of jars of these can last a while.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product works, and it has a great smell to it as well.  It holds hair well with a matte finish and the hold lasts well all day.  A little goes a long way also, which is appreciated.  I will continue to use it for sure.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all and this one is the best!</li>
    <li> I tried the rest. This is the best. Medium hold; medium shine. You don&#x27;t need much, so one container lasts a few months.  Great stuff, good hold, and your hair will have just enough shine.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite styling product for a *very* long time.  It looks good, smells good, and holds well.</li>
    <li> This is the way!  What a deal!  Practically getting two for the price of one.  I was thrilled when I discovered this.    SCORE!!    Yeah baby!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember when or where I first stumbled on AC forming cream, but this stuff is legit. I used to have really, really thick flat hair and this stuff was great. Kept it in shape and allowed me to control it. Love the scent (although many people can&#x27;t seem to smell it), doesn&#x27;t dry in thick, clumpy goo(women, or guys depending on your preference, can run their hands through it and not need to wash them with a hose and pumice after). As for shine, ACFC is the opposite of the disco-ball LA Looks/DEP stuff. I stopped using this about 2 years ago because the only store that carried it in my area was selling it for 18 bucks a pop, after that I switched to leave-in all day conditioners and occasionally tried the expensive stuff like Rough Luxury, Sumo, Armego...etc, but the conditioners tend to dry out by the middle of the day and the expensive stuff was either too hard, gooey or just didn&#x27;t hold at all. So I am happy to be back on ACFG. I picked up two for 22 and it arrived in 3 days. Just awesome stuff and will definitely be ordering from here from now on.</li>
    <li> Really great product from American Crew. As in the description, it is medium hold with medium shine.  However unlike other medium hold products, this might have a bit more of hold then normal medium holds. Smells great, really reminds me of a classic barbershop. I am currently growing my hair, around 3inches right now. I really like to use it because it does a good job of holding it back. It also doesn&#x27;t create that thick,super shiny, stiff look that gel does.  I would recommend it that you apply it on towel dry hair. On dry hair it looks a little too stiff and dry.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Great for longer hair.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s right, little use and it get the job done with no greasy stuff left at your hands.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this. He likes it. It used to be a subscribe and save item but they cut it (like many other things) which I find annoying but that has nothing to do with the product.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but I swear by it.  The forming cream gives a firm hold with out looking like you used Elmer&#x27;s Glue.  Also, it washed out very easily compared to most hair products.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used to control my very thick hair. It doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch or dry it out.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product. It&#x27;s pricey but each container lasts for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This gives me just enough hold (short mens cut) without making my hair crispy with dried product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get it for $10 a jar... then $12... then $18... then $20.  My local salon in Dallas would have a sale a few times a year and I&#x27;d buy a couple of jars for $15 each.  That was a few years ago and I just ran out, after a move to California.  My local Walgreens no longer stocks it, so Amazon Prime to the rescue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a good price and quick shipping.  Now I can throw that gelatinous crap away that I tried to find a replacement for this!</li>
    <li> Crew always a great product. wish they will be less expensive :)</li>
    <li> This product holds my style well, isn&#x27;t \\&quot;crusty feeling\\&quot; to the touch, not shiny, and smells great. After discovering this (and other Crew products) I&#x27;ve never used anything else. Great buy...</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect for giving me the style that I want. Allows me to roll out of bed, use a small amount to mess up my hair and keep it that way for the whole day. Great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t get hard like hair gel and still feels soft when touching it with great hold.&lt;br /&gt;Product came as shown and brand new with fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair in place. 3 ounces will last you months. What else can I say? This product is a success!</li>
    <li> I love Crew products and this one is no exception.  Very good product and the hold and shine is great.  Make sure you put it on wet hair, I have found it is not too great on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Very strong product which keeps its hold all day. If you&#x27;re a guy or girl with an undercut this is ideal. Amazon&#x27;s price is right!</li>
    <li> Keeps my luscious locks in check!</li>
    <li> I love American Crew and they had it so I bought it.  Then they sent it to me.  What a wonderful relationship.</li>
    <li> This product works great to help hold down those miscellaneous hairs. U don&#x27;t need to use very much.  It&#x27;s sticky!</li>
    <li> Crew forming cream rules. Makes my hair look as awesome as the rest of me. Sweet.</li>
    <li> My husband lives by this stuff and this particular type.  This one is however just for a man.  It has a man&#x27;s smell to it like he just came from the Barbershop.  I however like the blue one labeled Fiber which does not smell like a man.  When I straighten my hair, I use a little of the Fiber style to tame my hair and keep it looking great all day.  I hate the feel of hair spray and greasy look of gel.  The forming and molding creams by American Crew work wonders and are a great alternative to using hair spray.  This is an amazing value price online too.  You won&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else.  I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Keeps my thin hair together and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, providing the right amount of hold without too much shine. The double pack aspect is really good value as well. The product lasts for a while, but is not a super strong hold without using a large amount. Overall if your looking for a medium hold and a matte finish this is the product for you. Use it with dry hair for best texture effects, but recently towel dryed hair for the best shape.</li>
    <li> I use this and love it. I have very thick hair that needs a strong hold and this does the trick without making it look like it has been cemented.</li>
    <li> Unlike gels and pomades, this is a non-aggressive hair product. It works best in wet/damp hair and will not leave a wet or greasy look. It gives good body and has pretty much no odor. It will last all day (unless you get it completely wet). It doesn&#x27;t take too much to hold my hair, but a lot of cream will hold it rock solid if need be (like at a wedding or something where you don&#x27;t want your hair getting messed up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8-9 years, and have been very, very happy with it. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff religiously as I have a short cut with ultra fine hair, thinning on top.  This product price is great on Amazon and the two pack is worth the money.  The cream can be reactivated with water and gives all day control without making your hair too hard.  Guys, give it a shot, I have used it for 3 years with much success.</li>
    <li> I love American Crew products in general. However, this seems to be the best product for my hair and Amazon seems to have it for the cheapest price.  If you like to spike up your hair and don&#x27;t want it to looks oily/wet, then use this.</li>
    <li> First, I have thick hair and used to use a product that isn&#x27;t available anymore (Dep M Groom Mold 6).  I like a product that can have a really good hold and not leave your hair sticky when running your fingers and hands through it.  I first got this product from a party at Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s house where they were handing out samples.  Since then this has been the best feeling and best scented hair product out there.  I&#x27;ve tried to go cheaper and have failed with every brand name out there (mostly all leaving your hair sticky when dry).  So if you&#x27;re looking to get a hair product that is easy to style, keeps its hold, and still leaves your hair feeling conditioned and smelling like you just got out of the shower, then this is it.  Pay the extra cash and get a good quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used gel forever. Last time I got my hair cut the person cutting my hair used this.  It&#x27;s SO much better.  Your hair looks more &#x27;natural&#x27; if that makes sense.  Just remember to use a small amount...it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the trick!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used. Made my hair feel like natural, plus a medium hold and medium shine, which is exactly what I want. Not greasy at all. Easy to apply. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use most gels or other styling products because they irritate my scalp, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with this creme at all. It provides an excellent hold with a dry look, I wish my hair naturally looked the way it does after I use some of this. It takes a very small application, so one jar should last for months even if you&#x27;re a daily user.</li>
    <li> Believe me that I have tried numerous products similar to this one, most commercial ones, and this one has the best by far, I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Now, I ain&#x27;t necessarily in the bidness of tryin&#x27; new things, but this hair product is the bee&#x27;s knees. I used to use gel, ranging from the bargain garbage at Rite-Aid to the fancy goops offered at the hair salons. They just didn&#x27;t cut the mustard, or &amp;#34;part the hair&amp;#34; rather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product keeps yer hair in place and yer confidence high. It&#x27;s not gonna create no flakey white nonsense and unlike stiffening gels or sprays, this gunk stays flexible and light weight all damn day. Lemme let you in on my secret:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step One: Take a shower. You gotta get yo&#x27; clean on. This isn&#x27;t a necessary step, but I figured the world would appreciate your bathing. If you don&#x27;t want to take a shower, at least wet your hair. Some people will run it under a faucet, but I usually just stick my head in the toilet cuz it&#x27;s faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step Bee: Towel dry your hair. You&#x27;ll want it fairly dry. A damp head will be a well molded head. My mother-sister used to tell me that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step Tree: Take yer fingertip and remove a small amount (crack rock size) of cream from the jar. I rub it around in my hands and then clap them together like a mad man trying to remove the devil&#x27;s reflection from my mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4-9: Within the time it takes you to move your hands from the clapping position to your head, think about the things you&#x27;ll need to do today. Also, plan some responses for when men or women throw themselves at you. Yer gonna look good, so be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 10: Rub that stuff in yer hair. And style it the way you please. Use a comb if you gotta, I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff ain&#x27;t the cheapest goo on the market. That&#x27;s why I buy it on Amazon. You can thank me later.</li>
    <li> I received this item very quickly. It was packaged well and the price was great. I like using different molding pastes and creams and gels at different times and this is one I use before going out at night. It is very light and has a nice smell to it. Be careful not to put too much in or else you can&#x27;t comfortably run your own hands (or anyone elses) through your hair without getting slightly tangled.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good and it doesn&#x27;t leave you a greasy hair</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Works perfect for my hair length which is around 3 and a half to four inches.Fiber, grooming cream and molding clay work better for shorter lengths</li>
    <li> Holds your hair in place while also not looking like a gel helmet. If you add less to your hair you can get a more natural look, if you add more it will look more polished. Been using this product for over 5 years.</li>
    <li> This hair cream does an amazing job holding your hair in place.  Anyone who is tired of using gel or any other product on your hair should try this pomade.  Once it is in your hair it provides a solid hold, but does not leave your hair rock hard like gel.  Another great thing is if your hair does get out of place you just run a brush through it and it goes right back into place.  The price is also much better on here than it is in the store.  I got two jars on here for a $1 more than one jar costs at Target.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this gel, it is easy to use and apply. The vendor I bought it from was very convenient and the product was exactly what was described. I got two of these for $20. Usually, in stores they are around $18 per bottle. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Strong fragrance and very sticky but good hold.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in my hair for about 8 years and like it because it is not to heavy or shiny. It has just enough hold to get through the day without making it &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like you have product in your hair. When I purchased it, it was a good deal for the 2-pack.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal American Crew customer for nearly 20 years, and this is my current favorite hair product. The product holds my hair just the way I like it, and the hold lasts all day. It works best for me on dry hair, but does just fine when applied to damp hair right after the shower. The scent is great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is not the cheapest product, the quality is much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and one jar lasts me at least 6 months. I ordered the 2 pack in March, 2014 and I still have months left on the second jar. I have short hair and don&#x27;t use much each day, but can easily squeeze a year out of a jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good hold&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent&lt;br /&gt;Jar Lasts a LONG time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Travel - Not the smallest size jar, but TSA compliant. If the jar sits on its side for a day, all product lumps on that side.&lt;br /&gt;Heat - If you have this in a bag while traveling or in a hot car, the quality can degrade after heating.</li>
    <li> My hair is short and worn messy and I spend all of 10 seconds getting it that way.  This cream is great - not sticky or goopy or overly stiff.  You can wear it wet or dry and it is very hard to screw up the amount given how it works.  I typically hate the way gel feels and cannot wait to get it out of my hair.  This gel is not that way and leaves your hair feeling lightweight and natural - great product.</li>
    <li> We have been using this hair cream for four years now. It holds all day for and adult.</li>
    <li> This forming cream gives my hair shape without feeling hard (like gel) or greasy.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years now and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is my husband&#x27;s favorite hair cream.  he left the house without using it the other day and i was shocked at how flat his hair was:)  it&#x27;s definitely his best beauty product!</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ll be ordering this one again - quick delivery and great product (and value). thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty dang good.  I like the fact it&#x27;s not too shiny and that you can use it on wet or dry hair.  I ride bikes and suffer from helmet head quite a bit, but find this stuff still maintains its form and is restyleable (sp?).</li>
    <li> This is my go to hair product. I&#x27;ve used it for a few years. I used to buy it at one of the various local drugstores, but it was often hard to come by. They&#x27;d typically have oodles of the other American Crew products, but no forming cream. There&#x27;s a reason why. This stuff works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair right now, but have had longer hair and the product still worked great. Works best if your hair is already wet. Or you&#x27;ll need to wet it down to help work it in. But once it is, it has a very good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a couple of drawbacks I&#x27;ve discovered. If you don&#x27;t work it through well, then you can get white streaks left behind. Also, when it rains, you&#x27;ll notice the water on your head looking a little murky due to the cream.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Long time user of this forming cream, wont use anything else.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and exactly as stated</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much all of the American Crew products (Pomade, Fiber, Holding Cream, etc.) and I&#x27;ve found this one to be my favorite. It holds my hair well even with a little dab and it will have almost no shine, and it I use more than a little bit, it will add a shine to it while holding even stronger. If you&#x27;re looking for a versatile hair holding product, I would recommend this over the others.</li>
    <li> I got major cowlicks that are hard to tame.&lt;br /&gt;Crew forming cream is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for it - gels flake and the hold fades quickly, or the hair gets too crunchy; other pomades have just not had the weight to bring down the stubborn cowlicks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Rusk Wired, it had good hold and yet soft to the touch, no stickiness or annoying fragrances. Recently the Wired formula seems to have changed, it&#x27;s watery and no longer has good hold. I contacted the manufacture, no reply, so I am now on a search to find another suitable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my search has been frustrating, spending a lot of money on products that leave my hair hard, sticky and loaded with strong and unappealing fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product on Amazon, saw many favorable reviews, but found it to leave my hair hard like a helmet, so my search continues. In the meantime I have found some tubes of Wired still on the shelves with the old formula, maybe the watery stuff was a bad batch, I hope so.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because I don&#x27;t like how my hair gets sticky after use and I pretty much have to wash my hands or anything else my hair comes in contact with after applying this cream. Keep in mind that I generally don&#x27;t like using any hair care products so it&#x27;s totally possible that my only complaint is perfectly normal for these kinds of products and other people actually expect that and don&#x27;t mind. I just don&#x27;t know about that.</li>
    <li> It looks natural, smells great, very easy and fast to style.  I&#x27;ve never found a product like this.  Nothing else would work with my baby boy&#x27;s fine, straw-like hair.</li>
    <li> holds excellent, doesnt dry, flake or become noticeable. its one of those products where you go, finally i found it. i wont use any other gel.</li>
    <li> great product.great price at amazon. fast delivery. I use daily and it holds my hair in place, while not being stiff or flakey, A little dab goes a long long way.</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T FIND ANOTHER TO TAKE IT&#x27;S PLACE. IT&#x27;S BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS AND YEARS I GUESS THAT ALONE TELLS US THAT IT&#x27;S ONE OF THE BEST AND THE BEST FOR ME. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Product seems &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; compared to how it normally is. I&#x27;ve purchased many times before, but this time the product is very liquidy.</li>
    <li> This product is something I would suggest for someone who has is just getting into styling their hair. It&#x27;s sticky enough to give a decent hold, but not too much, and it isn&#x27;t matte, but it isn&#x27;t super shiny. It&#x27;s good for someone trying to decide exactly how they want their hair to look, before purchasing better products.&lt;br /&gt;No texture, but it does give a lot of separation. It&#x27;s very sticky feeling if you touch it, and leaves hair with a slightly greasy shiny appearance. Holds pretty well, but not too much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m going to continue to use, but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
</ol>
