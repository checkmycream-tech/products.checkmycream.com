      <li>and I loved the price.</li>
      <li>This color is SOOO gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>Bottle was full and item was described perfectly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice chunky glitter, and it applies fairly evenly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen a rose goldish color before and thought it was just gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>I love this polish!  </li>
      <li>I love this color!</li>
      <li>These looked AMAZING on the picture, so I wanted these sooo badly&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;-Essie is world famous, and I wanted to try how good they are.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who loves a nice glitter polish.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>As many glitter nail polishes</li>
      <li>Love the color, great glitter, dries fast on your nails.</li>
      <li>I love Essie polish</li>
      <li>I love Essie nail polish.</li>
      <li>Use it alone or on top of your favorite colors.  </li>
      <li>So glad I bought it</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>sure why it likes to come off like this, I&#x27;ll have to do some more experimenting because I love the way it looks so much!</li>
      <li>It applies easily and neatly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s chunkier pieces than a more misty glitter, great for a french tip or all over a neutral color.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still as smooth as the day I got it.</li>
      <li>You have to use several coats to get full coverage but great brand.</li>
      <li>Just a friendly tip.</li>
      <li>The pink glitter is a beautiful shade.  </li>
      <li>I love it so much and looks great with multiple colors!</li>
      <li>Order it and it got here super quick.</li>
      <li>It shows as a nice pink over most colors</li>
      <li>This one is very pretty</li>
      <li>This kind of polish is also chip-friendly in that if some comes off, no one knows since it&#x27;s an \\&quot;effect\\&quot; polish, rather than a solid one.</li>
      <li>Absolutely.... Love my new nail polish!</li>
      <li>I ordered 3 colours of Essie&#x27;s Luxeffects and they work as a shiny topcoat with sprinkly sparkly flakies, And Set in Stones looked perfect over my Hot pink polish (Dunno the name) and Stroke of Brilliance over Angel Red, And</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s beautiful with a light under coat of another pink or even white</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does chip kind of easily though thats the only set back of it.</li>
      <li>A last suggestion in order to prevent any crumpling or getting a more sparse glitter</li>
      <li>Essie can really do no wrong.</li>
      <li>OK So I have a secret obsession with sparkles, this particular polish has lots of different sizes of sparkles, you can add more layers to create depth or just leave on a couple coats as a top coat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little challenging, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>I got this in person at a retailer that was reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I have misplaced my first bottle of this nail polish so this purchase was to replace it, I&#x27;ve familiar with it</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how PRETTY it is.  </li>
      <li>:) I Definitely will be buying other LUX colors.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty combo.</li>
      <li>I have this nail polish in blue, and although the glitter is lovely and covers smoothly with one top coat, which can be hard to find, it is difficult to get off the nail.</li>
      <li>I thought it was a fluke, so I acetoned my nails and tried again--and huge chunks of my polish were missing withing 2-3 days, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s mandatory to aply a clear coat over it.</li>
      <li>Arrived early as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;a cut above\\&quot; over orly&#x27;s \\&quot; french manicure white\\&quot;,  sally hansen&#x27;s \\&quot;mauve it\\&quot; (pink), and orly&#x27;s \\&quot;liquid vynil\\&quot; (black), and the swatches results were amazing.</li>
      <li>it is nice but it gives a little glitter in order to cover the nail completely yu would have to apply at least 3 layers</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think that even that would be enough to completely cover the nail.</li>
      <li>; color not dark enough</li>

<li> The glitz can go from subtle to WOW.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t usually wear glitter polish, but I couldn&#x27;t resist this one.  </li>
<li> Oh and if you add nail polish remover to thin it down it will disinitegrate the glitter.</li>

<li> 1 mm of diameter) in a clear base.</li>
<li> I agree that you have to be carefull when you applied it because it can crumple, and the color base have to be well dry</li>
<li> sorry i purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;hard to remove</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I never review products, but I felt like I had to get the word out about this.  I love this polish!  The glitz can go from subtle to WOW.  Use it alone or on top of your favorite colors.  Give it a go and you too will become a fan.  One down side; be prepared for some work when it comes time to remove.  It&#x27;s a little challenging, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this in person at a retailer that was reasonably priced. I had a nail polish by another more expensive maker for years that was similar in idea, though the shape of the sparkles was different.&lt;br /&gt;These come out like variously sized metallic polka dots. You can wear it over another polish, or by itself. This kind of polish is also chip-friendly in that if some comes off, no one knows since it&#x27;s an \\&quot;effect\\&quot; polish, rather than a solid one.</li>
    <li> So dazzling! I love this color! May coats may be needed. :) I Definitely will be buying other LUX colors.</li>
    <li> Beautiful polish...Giving it as a gift but I know it will be loved! Bottle was full and item was described perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love Essie nail polish. This one is very pretty and I loved the price. Very happy I bought it.</li>

    <li> a great size of glitter it&#x27;s lovely. It&#x27;s chunkier pieces than a more misty glitter, great for a french tip or all over a neutral color.</li>
    <li> This review is for \\&quot;A Cut Above\\&quot; (the pinkish color). I haven&#x27;t tried the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lovee the way the polish looks. It&#x27;s a nice chunky glitter, and it applies fairly evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the way the polish came off in 1 huge chunk 2-3 days after applying it. I use a base coat, a coat or 2 of color, a layer of this polish, and a top coat. I thought it was a fluke, so I acetoned my nails and tried again--and huge chunks of my polish were missing withing 2-3 days, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why it likes to come off like this, I&#x27;ll have to do some more experimenting because I love the way it looks so much!</li>

I never knew HOW I lived without these brilliant topcoats when I love nail art so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons why I bought these colours:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Essie is world famous, and I wanted to try how good they are.&lt;br /&gt;- These looked AMAZING on the picture, so I wanted these sooo badly&lt;br /&gt;- These came in my Favourite colours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I call &#x27;&#x27;Great&#x27;&#x27;!</li>
    <li> It applies easily and neatly.  It looks great on my nails and would recommend this to any one!  So Ya</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this polish for some time and finally gave in.  Haven&#x27;t seen a rose goldish color before and thought it was just gorgeous.  I love it so much and looks great with multiple colors! a MUST buy for your collection!</li>
    <li> The polish consist on pink glitter and pink metal circles of different sizes ( the biggest is aprox. 1 mm of diameter) in a clear base. I agree that you have to be carefull when you applied it because it can crumple, and the color base have to be well dry or you are going to damage it. As many glitter nail polishes it leave a rough surface and it&#x27;s mandatory to aply a clear coat over it. I&#x27;d recommend to use for that purpouse orly&#x27;s \\&quot;won&#x27;t chip\\&quot; for a lasting result. I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;a cut above\\&quot; over orly&#x27;s \\&quot; french manicure white\\&quot;,  sally hansen&#x27;s \\&quot;mauve it\\&quot; (pink), and orly&#x27;s \\&quot;liquid vynil\\&quot; (black), and the swatches results were amazing. So far I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. A last suggestion in order to prevent any crumpling or getting a more sparse glitter you can add some drops of a nail lacquer thinner.</li>
    <li> I have this nail polish in blue, and although the glitter is lovely and covers smoothly with one top coat, which can be hard to find, it is difficult to get off the nail. Not a big deal, it&#x27;s glitter nail polish, that comes with the territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve had my bottle less than six months, and it is almost too dried up and gloppy to use--keep in mind I have a bottle of aqua Essie polish that I&#x27;ve been using at least once a month for over two years and it&#x27;s still as smooth as the day I got it. They missed the mark on longevity with this one!</li>
    <li> Essie can really do no wrong. I love this color. It&#x27;s a must have for every girls nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> Love the color, great glitter, dries fast on your nails. It dried up too fast in the bottle. I love Essie polish but I only got to use this one twice. Oh and if you add nail polish remover to thin it down it will disinitegrate the glitter. Just a friendly tip.</li>
    <li> it is not what i expected.  sorry i purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;hard to remove; color not dark enough&lt;br /&gt;hard to get off because of the glitter</li>
    <li> This is probably the best glitter I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It shows as a nice pink over most colors but when I layered it over Essie Penny Talk, it changed color to match it. It&#x27;s such a pretty combo. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who loves a nice glitter polish. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Perfect rose gold color glitter nail polish! Absolutely.... Love my new nail polish! Order it and it got here super quick.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this nail polish ALL THE TIME! So glad I bought it and it goes with any shade of pink!</li>
    <li> OK So I have a secret obsession with sparkles, this particular polish has lots of different sizes of sparkles, you can add more layers to create depth or just leave on a couple coats as a top coat.</li>
    <li> This is a glitter polish but I loved it.  You have to use several coats to get full coverage but great brand.</li>
