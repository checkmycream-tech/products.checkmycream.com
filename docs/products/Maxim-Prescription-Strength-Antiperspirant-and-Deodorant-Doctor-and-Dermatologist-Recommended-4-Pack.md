    <li> I have used this for several years and I am extremely glad I was introduced to Maxim. Without it I couldn&#x27;t wear any solid color shirts unless they were white or black.  Use the product every night for the first few nights and after a while one a week is all that&#x27;s needed. I wear whatever shirt I want now without worrying about not being able to lift up my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping from Corad on this product, thanks!</li>
    <li> It works in the first months. But after one months, my armpits get allergic to this product. Oh my god. I ordered this pack. Guess I would throw them all right now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I was diagnosed by a doctor with hyperhidrosis as a teenager and the prescription medication was no match for my sweat.  My mom ordered this for me on a whim just because we had already tried everything else and it really did help me.  I have been using it for several years and am very happy to have found it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! Works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, it isn&#x27;t a deodorant but definitely a very good antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for five years and it has never let me down and is truly the only thing that works for me!!</li>
    <li> My kids swear by this stuff. I personally do not use it, but my son has been using it for a year now. My daughter is using it now. Worth the money, and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Only product that works without staining clothing.Works great!</li>
    <li> This product literally changed my life.</li>
    <li> Great item, fast shipping!  Good product if you have problems with perspiration.  It is strong and does a good job of keeping it at bay.</li>
    <li> My son has had hand hyperhidrosis since he was very young. We began using Maxim when it was sold by prescription only because it is the only product that helped control and heal his breakouts. It is non greasy and no one knows he&#x27;s using it which helps with his self esteem. He is now 20 and we are glad it is sold over the counter now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I will buy in bulk and never be without it again.  I no longer have the constant worry, i dont have to pin my arms to my sides, or carry extra shirts in my purse.  Finally somehting that no only stops the sweating but the odor as well.. I feel like a new person and am sooooo grateful!</li>
    <li> Great price and these last forever. I am really satisfied with this product. Thank you. Great deal and great wuality.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as a prescription</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and lasts a really long time. I am very satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I never thought this will really work for me, but I was like I wasted so much money on trying other stuff and it didn&#x27;t work for me so let me give this one a shot and it actually worked a %100 for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you have the same problem you know the embarrassment and the all hassle we go thru trying not to show, but now after I started using Maxim I am %100 sweat free and I actually pick up my arms and not have them stuck t my sides anymore :)&lt;br /&gt;Do Not use a lot and itches at first. good luck everyone.</li>
    <li> It takes about 3-days for it to be completely effective but have found nothing better.  I recommend this to my friends that have the same problem.</li>
    <li> I have used maxim for years. It is the best product on the market. The price seems high but you use very little at a time.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller. Super fast shipping. This is the best product on earth to treat underarms wetness. I started using it at night and I saw the results the next day. If you have hidrosis problem this is your solution right here. If it does not work for you, then nothing on this planet will. I will definitely continue buying it. It works like magic.</li>
    <li> Great product !  It really works !!!</li>
    <li> Works where other antiperspirants fail.  Read the instructions.  Put it on at night before bed, and apply it sparingly or prepare to feel your armpits on fire for a few hours.</li>
    <li> It is very hard for me to find a good deodorant, because I have an internal yeast infection. The Maxim deodorant is odorless, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and I am free from microbial odors. So far its the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever bought. I recently bought my second set of Maxim deodorant. I really feel insecure without it. I am so very thankful to the Corad healthcare company. They have listen to my needs, and they have also been very supportive, to a point beyond my expectations. This product is one of a kind.  I may certainly recommend to my future patients.  Dr. Atwater Stomatologist- Mexico</li>
    <li> Performs as described. I recommend this for anyone who finds the over the counter products at a typical drugstore ineffective.</li>
    <li> If you have hiperhydrosis, this is a great product.  It doesn&#x27;t block moisture completely, especially when I exert myself or it&#x27;s super hot out, but I do find that it is helpful.  I also recommend Drionic for palmar sweating...</li>
    <li> This product served me for over 8 years!  I can&#x27;t complain about it at all, it works wonders, Just awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For NEW users, please try a small amount at night after shower, before bed.  Beware that it will probably irritate you the 1st month.  Itchy, you will wake up and want to scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Only apply once every 4-6 days! How can you beat that.&lt;br /&gt;*Its like $40 bucks for 4 botttles!  and it will probably last you over a year or two. This comes out cheaper than the regular stuff&lt;br /&gt;*No white stains!  Completely clear&lt;br /&gt;*Easy applicator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Its so strong, it might scare you the first month.&lt;br /&gt;*Itchy at night for beginners, if you apply a lot of the product on your armpits.</li>
    <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.  It is by far the best antiperspirant product that I have been able to find.</li>
    <li> This product works just as described.use at night and it is amazing.even works for 19 yr old college son. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years.  I have never had any problems with the shipping.  this last order one of the bottles somehow had a leak.  I contacted then with regards to how to return the bottle.  they simply shipped out 2 new bottles.  thumbs up to Corad Healthcare.</li>
    <li> It works great, but be careful. It&#x27;ll dry out your armpits and it can be painful if you use too much.</li>
    <li> very usfull! for me work great!</li>
    <li> This is a life saver.  Works great after the first week putting it on every night now I just put it on every other 2 -3 days.  It burns if you put it on after you shave.  This is not a deodorant.  This is to stop perspiration.  You still need to apply regular deodorant too if you don&#x27;t want to smell.  I used to hate when my underarms use to sweat so much it would drip and I couldn&#x27;t wear certain shirts because of the armpit sweat stains.  This stopped all of that :).</li>
    <li> I have been using this for my face, scalp, underarms for years.  Anywhere you put it, no sweat.  It can sting/tingle a bit when you put it on but that usually goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> Maxim is the only thing that has made me stop sweating. I&#x27;ve tried everything off the shelf, Sweatblock, and more. Unlike Sweatblock, which left me in itchy states of panic, Maxim when applied correctly (not too much each night), works perfectly. I think I&#x27;ve reduced the amount that I sweat by 90%. It&#x27;s really that good.</li>
    <li> works from the first day I apply it. I recommend. my armpits stop sweating from the first day. just follow the instructions for use.</li>
