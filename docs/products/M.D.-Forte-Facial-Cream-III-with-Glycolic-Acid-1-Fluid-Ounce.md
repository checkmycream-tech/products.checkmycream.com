      <li>I&#x27;m told my skin is in good shape for my age.</li>
      <li>If you can get the genuine article, this is a very good product.  </li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I love M.D. Forte products!  </li>
      <li>Since I had been using glycolic acid for months and had acclimated my skin, I bought both the M.D. Forte III cream and the face wash and was so glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 15 years and the company that makes it decided to replace it with something that will cost more and not be as effective.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
      <li>I LOVE glycolic</li>
      <li>I started with the Cream III and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>the aquacolic acid in the cream is stronger than most products sold over the counter.</li>
      <li>I thought I would like this product more.</li>
      <li>love the fact that MD Forte is made in America.</li>
      <li>My wife has used this product for many years, since it was recommended by a dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>a redhead fair and my skin was getting pretty crappy before trying glycolic acid.</li>
      <li>(maybe only to my own eyes), with good skin tone and color.  </li>
      <li>smooth look</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic on hands too/  </li>
      <li>Overall, great product and I plan on continuing to use this cream.</li>
      <li>I am not sure that I received the genuine product from this vendor, but it&#x27;s a wonderful product if you can find it online for this price.</li>
      <li>Being able to obtain it through Amazon is a plus, as the price through dermatology offices is usually much higher, if they even carry it.  </li>
      <li>Prior to use I had lots of sun damage on my very fair skin, with dark brown spots mostly on the side of my checks and covering my forehead.</li>
      <li>The entire brand of M.D. Forte is fabulous!</li>
      <li>I used Glytone for years to wash my face so my skin was pretty used to glycolic acid.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I love M.D. Forte facial cream</li>
      <li>skin looking youthful, smooth, and clear.</li>
      <li>After applying the M.D. Forte face cream I wait a bit until the product is pretty dry, then I put moisturizer on top.  </li>
      <li>, it has made my face so much smoother.</li>
      <li>I really like MD Forte</li>
      <li>/&gt;After some research I found the MD Forte and after using it for about a week&lt;br /&gt;I can already see an improvement in pigmentation and breakouts caused by using an AHA cream in the interim.&lt;br /&gt;You really have to find what works for you.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and love this entire  line.</li>
      <li>Love the other products</li>
      <li>There is really a difference in the high content.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference right away with the softness of my skin the next morning.</li>
      <li>; you are that old.</li>
      <li>almost completely cleared-</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smaller pores, smoother skin, adult acne</li>
      <li>For someone who is 64 years old - that&#x27;s saying a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The III is a little more drying than the II, so if you have dry skin, consider ordering the II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I also use Seabuckthorn Serum and Living clay all natural products to prevent dryness at my age a major issue.</li>
      <li>After about two years of daily use there are no brown spots on my face - they have completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product instantly smooths my skin, as if I&#x27;ve just had a professional peel.</li>
      <li>This cream should be worn overnight, if this is your first time using this line, you may feel some tingling, or slight redness.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 22 years.  I started with the lotion in level 1 and as I have aged, I&#x27;ve stepped up my concentration of glcolic acid to level III.  I&#x27;m told my skin is in good shape for my age.</li>
    <li> I can not recommend this product because it burned my face. It was recommended by a friend who loves the product.</li>
    <li> I love M.D. Forte products!  Seventeen years ago I bought some of the M.D. Forte line from my dermatologist, but they were so darn expensive I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to continue.  Then, a couple of years ago I was \\&quot;surfing\\&quot; Amazon and saw that they sold M.D. Forte - I don&#x27;t even know what made me look for them.  Since I had been using glycolic acid for months and had acclimated my skin, I bought both the M.D. Forte III cream and the face wash and was so glad I did!  My skin appears less wrinkled (maybe only to my own eyes), with good skin tone and color.  Prior to use I had lots of sun damage on my very fair skin, with dark brown spots mostly on the side of my checks and covering my forehead. When I say \\&quot;covering my forehead\\&quot; I&#x27;m not exaggerating, since someone once asked me if I had burned my forehead - so yes, the spots were bad.  After about two years of daily use there are no brown spots on my face - they have completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use M.D. Forte Facial Cream III during the day and Retin A at night.  After applying the M.D. Forte face cream I wait a bit until the product is pretty dry, then I put moisturizer on top.  I no longer wear foundation, except under my eyes to lighten my dark circles.  For someone who is 64 years old - that&#x27;s saying a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M.D. Forte products are still expensive, even on Amazon, so price around.  Amazon prices change with the wind, so do a search on the product and see if you can&#x27;t save some money. Sometimes I buy M.D.Forte from Amazon, but sometimes I find it cheaper somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I love what this product does to my skin!!!!  It helps to exfoliate and at the same time keeps it hydrated.</li>
    <li> I had previously used 20% Glycolic Acid for a long time, then ran out and since then have been using creams with less acid content. There is really a difference in the high content. This product instantly smooths my skin, as if I&#x27;ve just had a professional peel.</li>
    <li> I used Glytone for years to wash my face so my skin was pretty used to glycolic acid. I started with the Cream III and absolutely love it. I noticed a difference right away with the softness of my skin the next morning. If you have any open pores or broken skin (this includes plucking any facial hair), then you will definitely feel the sting from the cream so be prepared. Overall, great product and I plan on continuing to use this cream.</li>
    <li> The entire brand of M.D. Forte is fabulous! This cream should be worn overnight, if this is your first time using this line, you may feel some tingling, or slight redness. This is normal, it has glycolic acid which will remove dead skin cells. I have sensitive skin and love this entire  line. I highly recommend. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use this cream nightly. After trying others, this one works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I tried another product which changed the concentration of glycolic acid.&lt;br /&gt;After some research I found the MD Forte and after using it for about a week&lt;br /&gt;I can already see an improvement in pigmentation and breakouts caused by using an AHA cream in the interim.&lt;br /&gt;You really have to find what works for you.  It&#x27;s fantastic on hands too/  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> Using this since the mid &#x27;90s. Alternating with II and III. This is the highest amount of glycolics you will find in any product. 30 percent. It does the job. I also use Seabuckthorn Serum and Living clay all natural products to prevent dryness at my age a major issue. It does not hurt to take a day off. I think it enhances the efficacy of the product, but that&#x27;s my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that MD Forte is made in America. So little is made in America these days.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product or the facial cream II for 10 years.  The III is a little more drying than the II, so if you have dry skin, consider ordering the II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently went to have a facial and the person doing the facial asked what I use on my face.  She will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I really like MD Forte , it has made my face so much smoother. the aquacolic acid in the cream is stronger than most products sold over the counter. I worked for Dermatologist for 13  and foound out about it there.</li>
    <li> I thought I would like this product more. Kinda sticky on my face.  Probably won&#x27;t order again.  Love the other products</li>
    <li> If you can get the genuine article, this is a very good product.  I am not sure that I received the genuine product from this vendor, but it&#x27;s a wonderful product if you can find it online for this price.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t being made anymore.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 15 years and the company that makes it decided to replace it with something that will cost more and not be as effective.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product for many years, since it was recommended by a dermatologist.  Being able to obtain it through Amazon is a plus, as the price through dermatology offices is usually much higher, if they even carry it.  It arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Did I tell you I LOVE glycolic acid???!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with a 10% cream and have the best skin I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smaller pores, smoother skin, adult acne almost completely cleared- and definitely not noticeable anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product I do not feel the sting that some people refer to, however that mY e because I use glycolic acid containing products on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. I am 41, a redhead fair and my skin was getting pretty crappy before trying glycolic acid.</li>
    <li> It works.  Have used it for years.  Must get use to it....it will burn your skin if you don&#x27;t ease into it, but if you follow the directions and continue to use it, you will see results.</li>
    <li> I have been using MD Forte for 15 years.  Love it!  I am 55 and people comment on my skin and say &amp;#34;no way&amp;#34; you are that old.</li>
    <li> I love M.D. Forte facial cream it keeps me wrinkle free!!!  Its made me look 10 years younger, and I get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily and find it helps my skin retain that&lt;br /&gt;youthful smooth look that I miss from my younger&lt;br /&gt;days.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for everyone looking to&lt;br /&gt;keep skin looking youthful, smooth, and clear.</li>
