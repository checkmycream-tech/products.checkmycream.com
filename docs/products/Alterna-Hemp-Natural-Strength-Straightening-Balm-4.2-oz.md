      <li>Love</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Alterna Product for many years and have never been dissappointed until now.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I love Hemp straightener.</li>
      <li>Love this balm-best thing I have ever found for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Alterna Hemp continues to be at the top of my list.</li>
      <li>, it works great on my hair,the only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t smell good, but will keep using product.</li>
      <li>product has a very strong fragrance, comparable to cheap men&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair gets tangled and breaks way more easily when I use this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for making my hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Maybe its just my imagination, but this does not work as well on my fine, wavy/frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different products and this one is by far the BEST!!!!</li>
      <li>Plus, it also makes your hair silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find a seemingly similar product that was &amp;#34;updated&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Has anyone been able to find the original for a reasonable price?</li>
      <li>The fragrance is tilted more to a male preference, but that is my opinion.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s not the same and is a different size and &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; buy it at your own risk!</li>
      <li>My new stylist introduced me to this product and my hair stays straight and smooth from shampoo to shampoo.  </li>
      <li>She told me this product does both straighten her hair if she wants it totally straight and does it quickly or if she wants the beautiful curls that I saw she simply puts a bit less of it on her hair and squooshes it in.</li>
      <li>got this for my grandson&#x27;s very curly hair and he loves it.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>I stockpiled, but the 4.2 tubes I have aren&#x27;t working very well, so I think the product has degraded.</li>
      <li>but I really like the consistency and feel after using it.</li>
      <li>but he likes it straight and in control)</li>
      <li>Not the same as the original.</li>
      <li>I have short, curly hair, and the Alterna Hemp Straightening Balm made it full and wavy, and very natural, with plenty of shine.</li>
      <li>It has a new smell to it that took some getting used to</li>
      <li>I kept checking and finally found it in a tube for a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I put it on my wet hair after the shower to keep my hair from getting too much damage from the hair dryer and felt covered hot rollers.</li>
      <li>does* help straighten my long very fine and frizzy hair, but it leaves it sticky, dry, tangly and generally ugly in the process lol.</li>
      <li>Always so soft.</li>
      <li>will go to a store that offers Alterna Straightening Balm to compare the smell.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>my hair falls into natural curls after applied.</li>
      <li>and this helps keep it soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been through 7 or 8 products, but so far, nothing comes close.</li>
      <li>Simple, and straight forward in application.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product works wonder.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
      <li>am not sure that it is a genuine Alterna Product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is not authentic, and it even smells different- sort of like cheap cologne.</li>
      <li>I am about to order similar product in a different brand because I find the new smell of this unbearable.</li>

<li> This product is not as high quality as my previous product.  </li>
<li> I have hair that is frizzy, and i live in Florida, so my hair basically is always a mess.  </li>
<li> I could not find it locally so had not used it in a long time, ordered it online</li>
<li> I also use a flat iron after my hair is dry.  </li>
<li> Either way, it&#x27;s really old or not authentic.</li>
<li> My relative owns a hair salon and told me this item doesn&#x27;t even exist anymore unless it&#x27;s at least a few years old form when Alterna actually made it.</li>
<li> Not organics that I expected</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> As noted by other reviewers, I used this product for years, swore by it.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a very sensitive nose, so I was surprised by comments about this product being unpleasantly odorous.</li>
<li> Left my hair noticeably softer but had a weird medically smell to it.</li>
<li> Frizzy and not smooth finish, as opposed to the previous Organic version that was discontinued.  </li>
<li> THIS PRODUCT WAS CANCELLED BY ALTERNA A FEW YEARS AGO.</li>
<li> This is like having your hair straightened without the harsh chemicals and the ridiculous price.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency, and the final results on my hair after air drying or blowing it out were terrible.  </li>
<li> Not a good smell.</li>
<li> but the worse part is the smell-</li>
<li> Very disappointing change for the worse in product smell.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the product or if I got a bad one.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> The smell on this is horrible.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this product but it dries my hair out like nobody&#x27;s business. My hair gets tangled and breaks way more easily when I use this. It *does* help straighten my long very fine and frizzy hair, but it leaves it sticky, dry, tangly and generally ugly in the process lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I guess it does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> I have hair that is frizzy, and i live in Florida, so my hair basically is always a mess.

    <li> This is a hair balm that I have been using for years and love.  Since I use a hair dryer and a straightening wand, this is a great product to protect the hair from heat damage and also helps with styling issues.</li>
    <li> I received this product July 2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Alterna Product for many years and have never been dissappointed until now.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a very strong fragrance, comparable to cheap men&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure that it is a genuine Alterna Product.&lt;br /&gt;I will go to a store that offers Alterna Straightening Balm to compare the smell.&lt;br /&gt;If it smells like the tube I have, I will not be purchasing this product any longer.</li>
    <li> It has a new smell to it that took some getting used to but I really like the consistency and feel after using it. It&#x27;s not sticky at all. Glad to have found it again!</li>
    <li> As noted by other reviewers, I used this product for years, swore by it.  I could not find it locally so had not used it in a long time, ordered it online, the smell is terrible, also it does not seem work as well,  whatever they changed was not for the best.</li>
    <li> Love this balm-best thing I have ever found for my hair.  I have naturally wavy hair and this helps keep it soft and manageable.  I like the smell-reminds me of Aveda products.</li>
    <li> The smell on this is horrible. Not the same as the original. Very disappointed. Has anyone been able to find the original for a reasonable price?</li>
    <li> Provides great shine and manageability give to your hair and it is so easy to use and makes your hair look spectacular!</li>
    <li> Definitely keeps the frizz at bay on this curly head of hair. Very light, not sticky and my hair falls into natural curls after applied.</li>
    <li> Left my hair noticeably softer but had a weird medically smell to it. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> The straightening balm works fairly well during these hot, humid days!</li>
    <li> This product is nothing like he Organic version that has been discontinued.  It doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency, and the final results on my hair after air drying or blowing it out were terrible.  Frizzy and not smooth finish, as opposed to the previous Organic version that was discontinued.  I bought two of these, but the purchase was of no value to me.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I just love this product!</li>
    <li> Alterna Hemp continues to be at the top of my list. Simple, and straight forward in application.Great product for the man on the go.The fragrance is tilted more to a male preference, but that is my opinion. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Saw a lady with beautiful curly hair with no wisps at all. Asked he what her favorite product was to make her beautiful curls. She told me this product does both straighten her hair if she wants it totally straight and does it quickly or if she wants the beautiful curls that I saw she simply puts a bit less of it on her hair and squooshes it in. So, I bought three for the three curly heads in my family.  They all seem to love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it works great on my hair,the only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t smell good, but will keep using product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I put it on my wet hair after the shower to keep my hair from getting too much damage from the hair dryer and felt covered hot rollers.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years but it was for color treated hair and said it was organic . I was happy to find a seemingly similar product that was &amp;#34;updated&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t work as well but the worse part is the smell- it&#x27;s like men&#x27;s deodorant. I have to hold my breath when I put it on. I don&#x27;t even use it now and I bought 4 tubes. Lesson learned. If it&#x27;s not the same and is a different size and &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; buy it at your own risk!</li>
    <li> The Best product ever for curly or frizzy hair. Been using for more that 10 years! I just love it!!!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!! THIS PRODUCT WAS CANCELLED BY ALTERNA A FEW YEARS AGO. This is not authentic, and it even smells different- sort of like cheap cologne. My relative owns a hair salon and told me this item doesn&#x27;t even exist anymore unless it&#x27;s at least a few years old form when Alterna actually made it. Either way, it&#x27;s really old or not authentic. -SCAM ALERT-</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for making my hair soft and smooth. I&#x27;v used this product for about 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have short, curly hair, and the Alterna Hemp Straightening Balm made it full and wavy, and very natural, with plenty of shine. I used it successfully for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product was discontinued about two years ago. I stockpiled, but the 4.2 tubes I have aren&#x27;t working very well, so I think the product has degraded. I am now looking for a replacement. I&#x27;ve been through 7 or 8 products, but so far, nothing comes close. I can&#x27;t imagine why Alterna eliminated this excellent product. Please bring it back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a very sensitive nose, so I was surprised by comments about this product being unpleasantly odorous. I never thought that, and I don&#x27;t even wear perfume.</li>
    <li> Not organics that I expected</li>
    <li> I am very please in Alterna Hemp Straightening Balm, I have not used this product in a few years and it is discontinued.  So I am very happy that I was able to locate it on Amazon and the product is as good as I remembered!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found that allows me to straighten my hair and keep it straight.  I have tried many different products and this one is by far the BEST!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Hemp straightener. It makes straightener hair effortless and smells great! Plus, it also makes your hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this product it came in a pump bottle, and worked great.  When I tried to reorder I could not find the pump bottle, except from one seller and it had doubled in price.  I kept checking and finally found it in a tube for a very reasonable price.  Maybe its just my imagination, but this does not work as well on my fine, wavy/frizzy hair.  Don&#x27;t know if I will repurchase or not.</li>
    <li> Works great have used this product for years but it smells different. Not a good smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it has never smelled like this before. I can&#x27;t even use it. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the product or if I got a bad one.</li>
    <li> got this for my grandson&#x27;s very curly hair and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing change for the worse in product smell. I am about to order similar product in a different brand because I find the new smell of this unbearable.</li>
    <li> GREAT product for straightening and came in nice packaging from this seller. I have naturally curly hair and this product works wonder. My husband even stole it for his hair (he has body/some wave but he likes it straight and in control)</li>
    <li> Great product! Love The the way it makes my hair fee after blow drying and straightening! Always so soft. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> This product is not as high quality as my previous product.  The scent is not the same and it seems heavier.  I am using it.</li>
