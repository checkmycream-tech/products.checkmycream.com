<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s difinitely a good shaver to use for those of you who hate to shave. It&#x27;s almost as good as a strait edge razor but I do have to say it leaves your skin really smooth without any razor burns nor bumps. Recommend to those who have to shave everyday like me easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this electric shaver for over a month now, and I find it to be much less irritating to my skin than a blade+shaving cream. For those with sensitive skin, I definitely recommend making the switch to electric, plus this Braun automatically cleans itself so you won&#x27;t have weird stuff growing inside the shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a little bit of practice to get the closest shave possible--I found it helps to go over the skin a little slower to ensure good contact with the stubble. You also need to vary the angle of approach around your face to make sure there&#x27;s a 90 degree angle with the shaver. There is a three position sensitivity setting, for me the most rigid setting worked better to get a close shave and it wasn&#x27;t irritating to my face. The included trimmer is great for sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is fantastic for 95% of my face... but it has trouble giving a close shave on my neck around the windpipe. So far that&#x27;s the only drawback to this shaver. The circular head shavers may be a little better getting those tough spots on the neck, but for me this model is much less irritating to the skin overall, and maintenance is very easy.</li>
    <li> Gift for Son, he liked mine so we got him one.</li>
    <li> Shaver is working fine for me. Shave is very smooth. Recently I went to India and it worked fine with the 220 Volts power.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price.  That said, this was for my son, but I have the 7-series that I prefer much more.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with either from a practical perspective and the trimmer on the 5 series is much better.</li>
    <li> This replaced my Braun shaver which was about ten years old. The old shaver still worked fine,but i had left the charge cord at a hotel and I thought the price for a new cord wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Plus the battery on the old shaver was getting tired, as the red light would illuminate after a couple of shaves (used to be at least a week when newer). At first I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the cleaning system, thinking that it would do a cleaning cycle every time I returned it to the stand. ( I like to cycle the battery, yea, I&#x27;m old school). And I would be using al lot of cleaning fluid.  As it turns out, you have to push the cleaning cycle button to make that part work, otherwise it&#x27;s just a charging stand when you insert the shaver. So I just leave it unplugged and use it as a stand.  I rinse the shaver in running water after each use and shake it out. After 2 or 3 weeks of that, I&#x27;ll plug in the base and run a cleaning cycle and let it sit for the day.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver for about a month and have only charged the shaver once since the initial charge. The shaver is much quieter than the one it replaced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers and the Braun Series 550cc is by far the best.  It gives a nice straight razor type shave, and if you&#x27;re lazy like me, the self cleaning option is fantastic.  The blades contour your face perfectly, and I would highly recommend this Shaver for anyone that likes convenience, and tends to travel a lot.</li>
    <li> Works better than my last Braun.  The shave is smooth and the charging and cleaning of the shaver is easy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Does a great job shaving very close to the skin.</li>
    <li> Personally I have not found an electric razor (without paying a large sum of money) that cuts as close as my razor I have been using for 30+ years but my son loves this electric shaver and the cleaning system makes it less of a hassle for maintenance.</li>
    <li> When I first started to look for a new eclectic shaver I was overwhelmed with all the choices and the size of these systems. My last one was a Braun and it lasted me about ten years. I was also surprised that the manufacturers would allow such LAME videos on Amazon to promote their product. I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t show a professional company made demo.??? I&#x27;m glad I bought this 550c its the closest shave I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday gift to replace a Braun razor he was using. It was a less expensive model I had bought him only six months before. It had never performed well. Went back for another Braun because of past performance on other razors. Don&#x27;t know why, but  maybe you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Liked my first one so well that when it finally needed replacement after many years of service, I bought the same &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; version of the same model.  Great, smooth shave every time.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as a replacement for my old Remington DA307.  I had been using the Remington for years, and I had never replaced anything-- I was still using the original foil, cutters, etc.  Despite the fact that the Braun 550cc costs a great deal more and is brand new, it really seems much less powerful.  Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as the old Remington, except perhaps on my neck.  It is much quieter than the Remington, but that seems to be a reflection of its less powerful motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (12/09/2013): The longer I use this razor, the more  like it.  Shaves much better on the neck than other electric razors I&#x27;ve used, and shaves the rest of the face very well. All in all, I would definitely recommend this razor, and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked just fine as expected for just under a year when it suddenly just stopped working. I contacted the customer support line who gave me the run around and were very unhelpful. I would recommend going with a Phillips brand razor. If anything goes wrong they quickly sent me a new one-no questions asked.</li>
    <li> Had it two weeks now.  Still not giving a close shave.  It&#x27;s also not set up for lefty.  The head lock is on one side only. No big deal I guess, but not what I would expect from a premium shaver brand.  I hope I can get my Braun 6500 fixed.</li>
    <li> The shaver is just what I expected from Braun.  It works very good, and I am enjoying the self cleaning feature that I use every couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would have a problem with this product. One issue I&#x27;ve seen in reading reviews is that it comes out of the cleaning unit still wet. If that&#x27;s the case then you&#x27;re doing something wrong. Clean it AFTER you shave; it&#x27;s a 4 hour cycle. I haven&#x27;t had to change the solution yet, but as long as it lasts I don&#x27;t see that I will refill it myself like some have suggested. I do, however, take it out and reseal it in-between running cleaning cycles. After the cleaning cycle it&#x27;s like using a brand new shaver again. The travel case is great, not one of those soft \\&quot;Bag\\&quot; type cases that simply hold the unit. This one will protect it when your suitecase is being abused by airport baggage handlers. I had been using a Norelco for over 30 years and switched to this unit after my brother bragged about how good it cleaned his neck; he wasn&#x27;t lying. It does a great job cleaning around my jawline and neck and does an outstanding job trimming around my goatee. I found this on sale at Target for the same price they were asking on line, nice not having to wait for shipping. I would recommend the 500 series to anyone; well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> very close shave, had a Norelco before and this is hands down much better shave.</li>
    <li> My son loves this shaver. He got it as a gift</li>
    <li> working good so far (about 5 shaves) was skeptical since the last time i tried an electric was approx. 15 yrs ago. Fairly clean shave, real impressed. Takes me a bit longer to shave with this than those triple blades ive been using for years, but really seems just as good of shave or Real Close. Picked this up on a lightning deal which turned out to be a winner... For 60 bucks I did well.</li>
    <li> I had two (and still have one) of the older model Braun shavers.  The base used for charging and cleaning failed to close or latch after several years of use.  The Shaver is slightly better.  The base is the HUGH improvement because you just drop it in the the base.  No arm to close or break!  Break is too harsh they just stopped latching (both of my original based stop latching) and it still worked so long as I held it closed.  By the way I did and you can purchase a replacement base (which is why I still have one of the old style Braun units)from Amazon. The cleaning cartridges are exactly the same and Amazon sells them as well! All that being said I guess you can tell I LOVE my Braun shavers because I purchased a third one!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Day!</li>
    <li> This shaver is great, best shaver I ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for about 20 years (my first was a System 1-2-3). I&#x27;ve had several different ones since, ending up with a first-generation Series 7 Pulsonic. I was never convinced the Pulsonic was as good as the Activator it replaced. Maybe a year and a half ago, I started getting bad skin irritation on my neck after I shaved. I&#x27;ve tried several different things with varying degrees of success. And I&#x27;m using Nivea For Men Q10 face lotion moisturizer which has made a big difference.     -A Philips-Norelco travel shaver I own showed promise, so I tried the Arcitec with lousy results and returned it to Philips.     -The Philips-Nivea for Men shaver works really, really well, but I didn&#x27;t like shaving in the shower and it took too long to shave in the morning. Also, no way you can use it dry in the car if you&#x27;re running late.    -Back to Braun. I picked up a MobileShave M60-B last Christmas at Wal-Mart for about $15. The new foil is huge improvement over the old Braun PocketShaver, but it leaves too many long hairs on my neck.    -A traveling family member bought me a Braun Series 1 model that&#x27;s sold in Asia, the 110. Other than color, the 110 looks just like the 150 you can buy in the US, but is powered by two AA batteries and has the new-style \\&quot;Smart\\&quot; foil. This is an impressive shaver, but again leaves some long hair on my neck.    -Remembering how much I liked the old Activator, I decided to try the current Series 5 since it uses a similar foil and blade set up. I bought the old model 550. Bingo. Great shave like I remembered from my old Activator. It recharges quickly, and the lithium-ion batteries hold a good charge. I also like the way the 550 feels in my hand.     -About a month ago, I found the new Series 5 Model 550-cc at Wal-Mart and decided to take the plunge. The new Optifoil is a definite improvement over the \\&quot;Smart\\&quot; foil which was darn good itself. Very close shave, even on the neck. I was happy with the original 550 (it doesn&#x27;t have the clean-and-charge base), but I&#x27;m happy I bought this one. The new color scheme of solid black looks classy too, but the blue-plastic power button looks a little weak. (It doesn&#x27;t light up like the button on my Pulsonic, and the package seems to show it lit. No big deal, but worth mentioning). This model continues to be made in Germany, and it looks and feels like it is very well built. With the new 550cc you get the clean-and-charge base, a travel case, and a cleaning brush.    In the past year, I&#x27;ve probably bought more shavers than I have in the past 20. I suggest going for a Braun Series 5 and skipping the others. I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> its pretty good for an electric razor. Nothing will beat a blade, but it works well, even on my tough beard and head.</li>
    <li> Stores carry these are a lower price, Target, Walmart, Kmart suprised that Amazon.com seems over priced on most of its products this year!!!</li>
    <li> Works real well. Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> razor is superb, but there was no cap for the foil, and no container for the razor case and cord.</li>
    <li> Very Good.  Not as good as I wanted.  But it works.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;d like to say that I was a bit skeptical of the efficiency and comfort of an electric razor.  From a young age my father had told me that you can&#x27;t get a good shave without a manual or straight-blade.  I have had 2 electric razors prior to this purchase, both of which chewed up my face horribly.  With a manual blade razor, the close shave left my face raw, and made my face break out.  Even the new Fusion ProGlide from Gillette had the same effect.  I thought that I could never get an electric razor with a close shave that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I was wrong.  I have the thickest beard possible, and have to shave in all directions due to swirling patterns on my jaw line.  This razor was not only able to cut through my thick facial hair, but left my skin smooth and without irritation.  I have had this razor 2 weeks, and it has taken the nightmare out of shaving.  No more bumps.  Nice close shave, and a cleaning system that doesn&#x27;t make a mess of hair everywhere.  Please buy one of these, you won&#x27;t regret it.  Thank you Braun for making such an awesome product, you have my business for life.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!  I can say I love how it worked and cleans, however after six months of daily use this thing has went nut.  A few days ago it started cleaning itself on and off all day long.  Some times will run for 20 min until it is unplugged from the wall.  I used it this morning.  Went through the same clean problem as usual now.  I thought I could over look that, however after sitting on the cleaning charger for 6 hours today, the razor itself turned on and will not shut off.  By the time I went looking for the cause of the huming noise, the razor was running full blast and who know how long it had been running.  It was to hot to touch, so I had to use a towel to pick it up.  I had to push the shut off button several times to get it to shut off now.  Trying to reach Braun , but they only have east coast however.  The website says the closes service center is in San Fran</li>
    <li> Great shaving experience</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it because it&#x27;s quick, gives a close shave and self-cleaning. I love that he shaves more often now that he has it! The base does make a good amount of noise when it cleans. Since this is the first rechargeable, self-cleaning shaver that my husband has owned, there isn&#x27;t really a true comparison, but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have been a manual shaver my entire life (15+ years of shaving).  I always thought electrics were not going to get close enough to give a good shave.  My gf (now my wife) got me a cheaper electric shaver when I was younger as that is what her father uses.  I tried it for the 3 weeks or so and hated it.  It tugged and pulled on my hairs and generally irritated my skin.  I switched back to manual and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now fast forward to present day and I have grown tired of the irritation that I get from manual shaving (razor burn, bumps, in-grown hairs).  I will be the first to admit I am not the best at shaving.  I still get the occasional nick here and there but I get the job done.  Well I saw this shaver on sale at a local department store and started thinking that it might be time to try these again.  This time I will put down a little more money for a better shaver.  I did research here on amazon and other places and settled on the Series 5-550cc as it has some of the higher end features from the series 7 but at a $100 cheaper price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having only been using this new razor for a few days I can already say that it was a good choice.  I am getting a close shave faster and with much less irritation along my neck. Time to brake down the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Feels good in hand with a well put together shaver.  Sturdy with easy access to the long hair trimmer on the back of the shaver.  This is a plus as the long hair trimmer on the more expensive series 7 model was redesigned and not as user friendly.  LEDs are more minimal on this model but they get the job down and tell you what is going on in terms of battery life.  The clean and charge station is just icing on the cake as it allows easy charging and hands free cleaning of the shaver after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving: 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does the job.  Coming from a manual shave this gets really close.  Especially on the face.  The neck and jaw line I have noticed will have a little more stubble left over (why 4 stars) but the irritation-to-closeness of shave ratio is definitely in the positive.  This review might have to be edited after I get past my first three weeks but I am happy right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and Storage: 4.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this shaver is extremely easy.  Stick it in the clean and charge station and hit start.  It does the work for you.  Plus it lubricates the shaver for you as well.  One thing to keep in mind is that the shaver air dries after the cleaning so if you need to shave right away after cleaning you will have problems.  I have not had any issues as time between shaving for me is usually 20 or more hours.  Even if I shaved in the morning and needed a touch up at night I don&#x27;t think there would be any issue.  The shaver can be stored right in the cleaning station so that is good and it look nice with a pleasant blue color given off.  Makes a nice night light for the occasional bathroom visit during the night.  The only complaint I would have is that the AC/DC converter is quite long.  This might fit under the design heading better but if you are like me and keep this on your bathroom counter for storage you will have a larger plug converter hanging out.  Not a huge deal but for people that want a more clean look while not in use can be a issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does not allow half stars so 4 is what I rated this.  I would recommend this shaver to all of my friends.  While it might be a little expensive then some of the options out there it gets the job done well and comfortably.  I would defiantly suggest spending a little more on a quality shaver then a cheap solution that eats up your face.  This is a foil shaver so if you like rotary shavers more this would not be for you but everyone else should check this out.t over (why 4 stars) but the irritation-to-closeness of shave ratio is definitely in the positive.

    <li> Really great product from Braun, so far everything works perfectly. Love the design and how it works!</li>
    <li> I want my 7526 back.  Yea, the charging base was cheap plastic and you had to replace it.  I was using a 5550 for nearly 10 years, and it died.  I replaced it with a 7526. Worked 3 years and died, so I sent it in for repair and bought a backup.  Both are still working razors, now 7 years old, I gave the spare to my son when he reached shaving age.     Alas, I got tired of replacing the charging base, so I went for the new Series 5. I have been using it for nearly a year now and it is terrible.  Here are the issues verses my prior 7526:    1. If you look at the width of the screen, it is significantly smaller. It takes me proportionally longer to shave, almost 1.5x.    2. Newer isn&#x27;t always better. If you look at the design of the foil on the series 5-550 and the foil on the 7526 you will  note that the Series 5 has much smaller round holes in the micro-screen and they are closer together.  The 7526 holes are farther apart, and they are rectangular, allowing for larger whiskers to enter the shaver.  This directly relates to How close a shave I get, and how many times I have to go over the same spots.  Given the decreased screen size, the time to shave is now double, and indeed it is.  When I shave with the 550, the heavier beard area&#x27;s just in front of the ears look like they already have a 5:00 shadow.  Do I have to really press hard from multiple directions to get rid of this very visible shadow.    3. The cleaning system sucks.  The 7526 would wash and blow dry your unit.  The 550 just washes it and it as to sit and  air dry for a few hours.  Also due to the longer shaving time, I have to recharge the razor every two shaves, compared to 5-6  for the 7526.    I am taking my new 5-550 and tossing it in to my travel bag. I will use it on vacation.  For $150, I don&#x27;t want to toss it out.  I have just ordered a $60 base for the 7000 series, and I found factory refurb parts from their \\&quot;partner website\\&quot; for parts, when you go to the Braun site and select buy.  I am buying a refurb 7526, and if I have to replace the base every 2-3 years, or repair it, I will. I could go to an 8000 series for the cost of what of going back to a 7526 and cleaner, but I am going to stick with what I know works very well.    In summary:  The 5-550 series requires me to shave twice as long.  I have to press harder to get a closer shave (which does wear down the foil prematurely).  The foil design change to \\&quot;dense, small, round\\&quot; from \\&quot;triangle, sparse, larger\\&quot; is not as good a design as their 7000 series.    Oh, as a last mention... I think the only thing made in Germany is the label...</li>
    <li> After owning this razor for a while, I can truly say that this device is craptastic.  I fell back to using an older/more expensive model that performs *significant* better.  I would not but this razor again and I&#x27;m even considering looking at other manufacturers -- something I never thought would happen</li>
    <li> Does a great job--good close shave.  I have owned several Brauns and wouldn&#x27;t have any other brand!</li>
    <li> This shaver system is my first Braun purchase. My major concern was how close a cut I would get, without inflicting any damage to my rather sensitive skin.  So far, the shaver works well, and no damage to my skin. And, how sweet it is to not end up with those annoying little nicks and cuts I was getting with a blade razor.  I recommend this system, wholeheartedly!![[ASIN:B003YJB026 Braun Series 5-550cc Shaver System, Black and Silver]] Order from AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Everything about this razor works well and makes sense.  No more razor bumps!</li>
    <li> Amazing shaver!!! Saves me 20 minutes(compared to my last shaver). Very very close! So far my best buy of the year!!! And kosher ;)</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to set up and looks great on the counter</li>
    <li> Good fast shave. I have a thin moustache and beard with some complicated hairs and it works great. I had several lower price foil Panasonics and Remingtons and several rotarys, so I have not a good criteria to compare this series 5 with similar price options.    Cons:  - The lights that indicates the battery charge is an annoyance. Why they think the common user needs need to see how the battery is draining, it is a shaver not a smartphone. It is useless to see the ligths blinking when starting to shave. The final message to me is that I have to ignore it and get used to it. You are supposed to feel that you have a reliable intimate toy not a complicated toy.  - The dirt indicator started to flash too soon after a pair of times starting to play with my new toy, it was obviously not dirty. So it gave me a bad impression on the supposed frecuency to use the cleaning system. What happens with the other models with no cleaning system, they got dirt differently???!!!. It gives me a bad impression to be an obviously way to force you to use the system and spend on cartridges.    Other notes:  - Reading the manual: the cleaning lub solution cartridge is s supposed to be used for 30 cycles.  - It can be charged and used while charging with the cord without the base or charge it with the base. Don´t worry, you don´t have to carry the cleaning charging base on your trips.  - The protective case is a nice semi rigid pouch. No space for the cord. Only for the shaver (tight).  - The shaver is made in Germany, good quality, ruberized sides.  - Only for dry use, be sure you know if this is for you. You can rinse it on the tap taking care the tip is the only part gets wet.  - I&#x27;d recommend Braun to include a foil protector, it is easy to damage the tip. I liked it on my old Panasonic. If you leave your shaver on the lavatory and it is a wet area (the pouch is not designed to be splashed), is good to leave it protected or somebody may accidentally ruin your shaver.  - The cleaningsystem needs a previous manual brush cleaning action, the cleaning systeem is to desinfect and lubricate. The manual says that if you don&#x27;t use the system is good to lubricate with machine oil from time to time. I wonder what really is the best tipe of oil for this.  -Trimmer is good.    If you are new on shavers or thinking to leave razors. I will share some shaving hints just with you...    1. Wait some weeks for your face to get used before judjing it is good for you. Your hair changes and your skill of the propper pressure changes.  2. Shave first before shower or washing face (great Braun´s advice), natural grease and dead skin flakes are good lubricants and prevents irritation.  3. Use liquid soap or shampoo to clean the head and rinse it with tap water. For me Braun´s cleaning station most important function should be lubrication for a good shave and to prolong life, you always have to remove hairs manually after one or two shaves. Wet/dry models are important for fast manual clean. If you are clean and tidy, the desingfecting function of the system is not important unless you are an hypocondriac.  4. Buy a 1mm hair trimmer, it trims better and faster than the one included in shavers, since I use mine, I noticed it is easier to shave after trimming.  5. As you get skilled on electric shavers you can opt for a \\&quot;half day beard\\&quot; look (my wifes like it), or a near baby face. You can´t do it with a manual razor.  6. If you need to go on an important total baby face ocassion use a manual razor.    Other points:  - To solve my irritation problems using razors, I started with cheaper shavers and they demonstrated to be a solution for me, I went on Braun based on reviews and to series 5 to see if there is a difference on the money, the difference is that it is softer, easier and faster to be near baby face.    - You can be sure that if you see and man with pimples or irritation on the beard area it is almost sure he has not discovered the importance of an electricshaver. Poor guy.</li>
    <li> I  bought  this shaver  because  my  24  year old  son complain ed  about his  current  shaver  which  is another  well know  product. I heard this  braun  was  one of the best  i must  tell you  my son is  greatful  and  still thanks  me  for  buying  this shaver. No  bumps  easy  to clean. And  His  face is nice  and  smooth.  great  product.</li>
    <li> My husband asked for an electric shaver to replace his Norelco, which he said was &amp;#34;tearing up his face.&amp;#34;  He loves it and says it provides a much smoother shave with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning feature isvery nice.  I picked up teo replacement cleaning cartridges at a local store for about 12 dollars.  The only complaint I have is that when he puts the shaver in the cleaning station, it goes through a few LOUD, buzzing cycles.  This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but I still HIGHLY recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Updated Review 6/25/15- Revised to 4 stars now due improved charging times and adequate shaving results. It still takes 3-4X longer to clean and charge than older generation Brawn model 8XXX razors &amp; is louder but you just have to take that into account. Also the Floating cutter does rotate like older models. It was just had to break in and go through a couple cleaning cycles. Sometimes the Cleaning cycle does not start after pushing the start button. Have to uplug and remove razor then start again.  Not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an Okay razor but a step backwards in performance.  I have been using Braun Series 5, Model 8xxx Razors for over 11 years. This is my 3rd. The other 2 just wore out the popup trimmer switches but still charge and shave. I was hoping this new 550cc would be as good.  Sorry to say the 550cc is not.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: It shaves close with the same foil and cutters I had before.  It has the same Clean &amp; Refill cartridges in the cleaner base. I has a newer better grip shape vs. the older models and it weighs about the same. The cleaner station is slimmer but not compatible with older razors.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:  It makes more noise- a deeper buzzing sound, than the older models. It takes 4 times longer to charge. It has a 6vdc charge module/plug instead of older 12vdc chargers. (Explains the long charge cycle)  It only gives me about 2-1/2 full shaves before it starts to slow down. The Charge warning light comes on before I finish the 2nd shave. The Floating cutter no longer rotates in the shave head to allow easier brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Over all it&#x27;s not a bad razor, but the long clean and recharge cycle and noise are a disappointment for $100. Can&#x27;t say if the much pricier models with cleaning systems also went to the 6vdc charging and batteries but if they did, they would be equally long and probably as noisy.  When this on wears out, will have to look at other brands again.</li>
    <li> This Braun electric shaver is fantastic and so is the cleaning, charging, and storage station. My girlfriend says now that I shave everyday I look much younger. The price was ridiculously low ($129) and I got a $20 Amazon gift card to top it off. Great deal! Free Shipping, no TAX!</li>
    <li> Love it- closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I switched from a Remington shaver and there&#x27;s no comparison.</li>
    <li> HUSBAND has cancer. I have to shave him. This works great for someone who has no clue what she is doing.</li>
    <li> I love a really close shave. I mean a really close shave. I have always used a manual razor. I didnt want to admit it, but the manual razor was causing me to break out. I had to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of price and quality I think are very very good with this product. It does get a close shave, it make take a little bit of work but it can do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has stopped breaking out, my face doesnt hurt, and I shave more often which reduces my chances of being a hipster by about 10 hipster points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this, the next model up has the side-burn trimmer which would be nice to have. If it was able to get a close shave on the first pass it is easily a 5 start razor, but 3rd or 4th pass it makes it an excellent 4 star.</li>
    <li> Old shaver was 15 plus years and couldnt find screen which forced me to by the 5 series. Like the small head and weight of the unit plus speed of the cutting heads. Wife doesnt like the obtruse black charging kit on the bath counter. Undecided about the cleaning chemicals as of yet.</li>
    <li> Gifted to son but he doesn&#x27;t use this type of razor.&lt;br /&gt;Hubby has one similar and dislikes the extra step that&#x27;s recommended to keep it operating well.&lt;br /&gt;So I have an unopened gift I can&#x27;t use and can&#x27;t return.</li>
    <li> Replaced old Braun that was 14yrs old.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it lasts that long1</li>
    <li> Gift, well made stuff</li>
    <li> I just love it! Perfectly smooth! Wonderful shaving experience! Easy to clean, fast charge, and it&#x27;s easy to use. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever bought. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my 27 year old son for Christmas. He tells me that he is very pleased with it and that it is excellent. The shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving but this shaver makes it easy, especially places typically hard to get on your face.  Cuts clean and close.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, works just as advertised. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son loves it and very little irritation</li>
    <li> The Braun gives a good shave, though under the chin is difficult, as with most shavers. The cleaner leaves a nice lemony aroma and does a nice job.</li>
    <li> First, I am not a regular buyer when it comes to electric shavers.  I have been using razors for the past 8 years and decided to change it up.  Before I went straight to razors I used a circular head shaver, but I really did not like it and the battery didn&#x27;t last for more than a year.  I purchased this Braun based on some reviews as well as for the price.  On Amazon it was 25% cheaper than buying it at Wal-Mart.  I wanted to get the 7 series but since I have not had a shaver in a while, I didn&#x27;t want to risk more money on a shaver if I was not happy with it.  So far I am very happy with the 5 series.  It shaves pretty close.  I can still run my hand across parts of my face and feel a little roughness, but visually it is not noticeable.  If I really want it to be smooth I run my razor over those areas again.  The cleaning unit gets the head really clean as well.  Only small issue I have with the whole thing would be that the carrying case is made out of fabric. So it makes it a little harder to keep it clean compared to vinyl, leather, or a similar material.  I have only had it for a little over a month so I cannot comment on the durability or the battery life span, but I will be sure to update the review if anything happens in the near future.</li>
    <li> I like it and everybody around me want it but it is so expensive！it is a good shaver  you can choose it！</li>
    <li> Have been using Braun electric shavers for years and this newer technology shaver is by far the best. It provides a very close and smooth shave and charges very quickly, I recommend this shaver to anyone who uses an electric shaver.  Mike P.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. I don&#x27;t get bumps after using it and it makes my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> After 5 years of loyal service, my Braun 7526 died last weekend. I&#x27;ve always used Braun shavers, and opted to check the local Wally World to see what they had in stock. I found this system for $149, and have been pleased since shave #1. The base creates quite the glow in the bathroom at night which is a bonus during a middle of the night bathroom trip.</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied,I&#x27;ve been a braun user for the past 20 years and never before had a complaint.  My current razor has trouble with the automatic cleaner,the connection between the razor and the automatic cleaner is sporadic,and requires my jiggling the razor until it makes contact. Sometimes it takes quite a while. I called customer service to see if a technician could help me ,but was told they don&#x27;t have technicians and I should mail it in.  I decided that it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost and aggregation to mail it in,so I keep jiggling. The razor when charged works excellently.</li>
    <li> First, I got this on a Kindle Special Offer for $64. I had been using a cross between a 20 year old Panasonic that I paid $100 for back then, and a track 2 type razor.  This is a decent electric razor and will give you a reasonably close shave as long as you use some type of  pre-shave lotion. It will not give you a shave as close as a normal twin blade razor, and in my 40 years of shaving I&#x27;ve never found an electric shaver that would!  The razors head has an adjustment to change the angel it contacts your face which may give you a more comfortable shave.  The only complaint I have is the cleaning system!  Refills are expensive, and the solution evaporates quickly whether you run a cleaning cycle or not.  At $64 I like it, at Amazons normal price, look elsewhere!!</li>
    <li> Good shaver.  Easy to handle.  The three shaving levels have been good. My light beard needs a gentle shave. The shaver delivers.    Quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> Hello, I have used Braun shavers since I started shaving. There is simply no comparison, they shave so close even with old methods like wet shaving can compare. The battery lasts 10 days, it is amazing, easy for business trips. The new cleaning system is also very practical. I will definitely keep buying Braun Shavers.</li>
    <li> I have been a long-term user of Braun shavers. I&#x27;ve used them for more than 20 years. After trying several other brands I found them to be the best for me. This one is the best yet. Very complete shave and yet smooth to my face.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but he is used to the series 7.  At this time, couldn&#x27;t afford the Series 7.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do..  Great shaves every time..frank  s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it over any of the others I have had.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my son and he loves it. A great choice for a  birthday,anniversary, Christmas and going away to college gift.&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend it. Thanks</li>
    <li> My husband thinks Braun Shavers are fabulous.  He had to replace an old one he had for years and this one fits the bill.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1HZQV117Z92JL]]I recently purchased this Braun Series 5 550cc. I love it. It was a huge improvement from the Series 3 I had before and better than the the Norelco one I had years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-As you can see in the video, the shaver is sharp and fast and has cut down my shaving time a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I love the charge/wash station and I wasn&#x27;t sure I would. It cleans the shaver well and disinfects which has decreased the amount of shave bumps and pimples I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-With shavers in the past I would have hairs that got pulled causing pain and also a red mark. I have never had any pulling or and hairs get stuck. A testament to a great motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life is great. I&#x27;ve gone 3 or 4 shaves on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this video you get to see a real shave in action and a few highlights of the shaver. Also I have included the link to the refills for the \\&quot;clean and renew\\&quot; cartridges that clean your shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007SNGSFS Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills, Frustration Free 4 Count]]</li>
    <li> Great razor. Has adjustable head settings. I use this all of the time. Cleans easy too</li>
    <li> Bought the Braun Series 5 shaver 2 weeks ago and it is by far the best shaver I have ever used. Beats any Norelco I have ever had. This Braun eliminates any razor burn on my neck and throat area. Lookin forward to many good years with this Braun. To help with a close shave I just put a little Talc on my face prior to shaving....try it you will like it.</li>
    <li> Seems they have changed the foil, I get a quicker closer shave with my old Braun. Nice in your hand though and still a great razor.</li>
    <li> Product was defective. The cleaning mechanism did not work</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hipster son who somehow thinks a sparse tuft of multicolored wiry hair makes him look like a man.  (Roger - if you are reading this - IT DOESN&#x27;T.) Was hoping that he could be tempted by a high price shaver, since clearly the disposable 2 blades are beneath him. (Roger - if they have been good enough for your father for 28 years, I guess you can use them too.) He carved some new mutton chop TERRIBLE looking design along his jaw bone with this razor.  It is not the razor&#x27;s fault that he has no sense of personal hygiene. (Roger - it is also not my fault. You are incorrigible.) Luckily, my good son WHO HAS A JOB started to use the Braun and has been using it daily, with very close results.  Hopefully this will result in a girlfriend, a fiancee, and a grandchild for me. I am getting old.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband.  He loves it!  Now we cannot get the clean and renew cartridge.  Cartridge can&#x27;t ship. Razor won&#x27;t charge without cartridge.  Now what do we do?</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this! Does a great job! So easy at cleaning itself!</li>
    <li> very weak cutting on a two or three day beard, especially around the neck area. I&#x27;ve resorted back to using my conventional injector. Have used others but thought this one would be different. Thrown in the drawer with a couple of other duds!!</li>
    <li> Takes much longer than manual shaving. Rough, not close cut, shave. Marginally better than the rotating head shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Looks very nice. Holds charge well. Loud.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a manual razor ever since I started shaving (I&#x27;m 63 years old now).  I hate shaving, but I like to have a cleanly shaved face.  So I thought it was time to go electric.  After a lot of research and reading reviews I decided on the Braun 550.    What a disappointment.  It seems like a well built shaver, but I just can&#x27;t get as close a shave with it as I can with shaving cream and a razor.  I can&#x27;t stand it!    I gave the razor to my son, and I am back to using my old trusty manual razor with blades.    I still hate shaving, but at least I am getting a close shave and a smooth face again.      For a few hours at least.  :-)</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend this product. Close shave and value could not be better.  Braun has always been my favorite company for a shaver.</li>
    <li> Like my previous Braun razor, that died after 10 years, this one works very well.</li>
    <li> Instructions not clear about charging razor?Does the shaver charge in the cleaning station? Store razor in cleaning station when done</li>
    <li> All I can say is I had a Norelco that worked great for 20 years.  When it finally died I thought Id move into the 21st century and try the Braun.  I made the mistake of NOT reading the reviews to find out that it takes twice as long and then I have to finish the job with a straight razor.  I charged it up and it worked for 2 days (sort of).  Then it stopped working and when I tried to send it back, Amazon&#x27;s policy is that they dont accept returns on electronics.  After sending to authorized dealer repair shop, it is running again but is still POS.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried electric razors by Norelco and also Remington and have been less than satisfied.  The usual culprit is the neck area, which would often result in pulling and red skin and lots of remaining hairs.  I can honestly say that the Braun has been able to shave the neck area and jawline better than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried - without leaving random stray hairs.  While even this razor does not handle a 4 or 5 day growth of hair completely pain free, it is by far the best.  Also it gives the closest shave of any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Not sure if this is just unique to foil razors but its as smooth as a blade razor.  Also a strong point of this razor is that the trimming tool is extremely efficient.  I have found that if I haven&#x27;t shaved in a week or so I can reduce my beard to that nice stubble look in just a few minutes completely pain free.  From there it is a quick and easy shave with the Braun if I want the squeaky clean look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system seems to work fine for me.  I usually clean it after I shave and then leave it to dry until the next day.  It is a bit loud, but it&#x27;s nice to have the clean lemony scent every day when you start shaving.  The cleaning fluid does evaporate somewhat quickly.  If you are super worried about this you could remove it after each cleaning and seal it up.  But I&#x27;ve gone a few months without having to replace it or worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase, and would highly recommend Braun razors to anyone.  Definitely worth the cost of paying a more.</li>
    <li> I find that this razor gives me the best shave ever from an electric shaver. The tilt head makes it easy to get to the curved areas of my face and the result is smooth. I find the cleaning system to be very effective. Good choice!</li>
    <li> He said it held a charge well, he cleans it when he gets home (after 5 days) gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Everything about the product and delivery was spot on. I&#x27;ll add that I didn&#x27;t believe that I could experience as close of a shave&lt;br /&gt;as with a blade razor but I have. Fallow the suggestions sent with the product to the letter and in three weeks your beard/result will change as they state. And no more red face or developing cold weather reaction to your skin from two/three rounds with a blade.;-)</li>
    <li> loved it..came in on time and works like a dream.  I am very happy about this product and would recommend it</li>
    <li> The reviews seemed good for this shaver and it was easy to see why.  It&#x27;s a sleek black product in a sleek black box.  It doesn&#x27;t just look good, it works!  I&#x27;ve purchased Remington&#x27;s and other razors. This quality product leaves no hair behind.  It gets them all.  I&#x27;ve always found it difficult to maintain electric shavers.  I hope that won&#x27;t be the case this time.</li>
    <li> I first thought the cleaning function was hype, but have come to appreciate it.  Another fine Braun product.</li>
    <li> Worth every dime and bought at a better price than any other store.  Easy to clean, great results, and battery life is great.</li>
    <li> bought for my son I think he likes it but said something negative  I forgot what though</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco for several years and since they joined with Phillips, their quality has suffered. This Braun runs circles over the Nerelco, gives a smooth shave without pinching like the Norelco.</li>
    <li> I used braun for 20 years the same brand shaver and never have any problem it like my buddy i ever will have.</li>
    <li> I received one of these as a gift, and it&#x27;s a good thing I did.  I&#x27;d been trying to nurse the last of the life out of two 7526&#x27;s that I have that were great shavers in their day, but that day was fast passing.  I&#x27;d tried to buy a (cheap) replacement in a rebuilt Remington, which had lasted five weeks, then &#x27;tanked&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new shaver works great for me, at least as good, maybe better, than my 7526&#x27;s did when they were new.  If nothing else, the battery, being a lithium ion, is a much, much better choice, thanks to its lack of &#x27;memory effect&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few shortcomings with this shaver, as pointed out by others, such as the lack of a travel pouch that will handle the charging cord as well as the shaver and the lack of a protective cap for the business end of the shaver, but these are not a problem for people with 7526&#x27;s that are being replaced, as both the travel pouch and the protective cap from the 7526 will work just fine.  Works for me. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a fitting replacement for my 7526&#x27;s.  Now, if it will just last as long...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit 5/9/12:  I think the &#x27;clean and renew&#x27; system is a bit over-hyped, and there are a lot of ways to keep the shaver cleaned, and lubricated, if lubricating is actually necessary.  And one of the &#x27;manual&#x27; ways suggested by Braun will, and I know this from experience, greatly reduce the useful life of the mesh screen...that of loosening the head of the shaver, and then running it to shake out the clippings.  Much better ways exist, including removing the head and tapping it on a hard surface, and brushing out the cutter bar with the brush and then running the shaver and blowing on it.  And a favorite way of mine is to keep a bottle of &#x27;canned air&#x27; on hand, and literally &#x27;blowing&#x27; it clean.  This works very, very well, and gets out the dust from places the brush cannot reach.  I may use the &#x27;clean and renew&#x27; rig once every couple of weeks or so, but not more often, as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Davidk it&#x27;s necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for several months. I doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like my old brand. The charger unit is convenient as long as you don&#x27;t have to go on a trip. The cleaning component is nice although you do have to purchase refills.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver, I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s awesome, but the button on the front is kinda cheap and became stuck one time and took me about 15 minutes to pry the button back into place, but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great still using it for two years no problems to report with it</li>
    <li> This has to be the best Braun shaver ever - And I have owned several over the past thirty years. The foil head has three setting for tracking the surface of your face. The unit holds a charge in excess of one week with daily use. The charging/cleaning station does a great job handling both. In spite of a heavy beard, the cleaning solution cartridge lasted three months. The [[ASIN:B007SNGSFS Braun Clean and Renew Cartridge Refills]] are available in bulk, which adds up to $20 per year for my daily shaving needs. I recommend using either [[ASIN:B004ZBS4U8 Somersets Original English Shaving Oil]] or [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q Shave Secret Shaving Oil]] with this shaver for a shave as smooth as a baby&#x27;s, ah, er, rear end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> After 2 months of use my foil broke in half. Called Braun and they said it would take 4 weeks to replace it. After 4 weeks I never received it. Called Braun again and they said they lost my order and it be another 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Called Amazon and they sent me a new razor that took 5 days. Yea and 5 stars to Amazon. Boo and 0 stars to Braun. Needless to say I would never buy anothe Braun product.</li>
    <li> My life expectations were a bit high for this.  I decided it was time to leave my 8yr old electric razor for a new one.  So far I&#x27;m less than impressed.  While it initially feels smooth, the shave is not as close as my trusty old razor.  Still too much stuble, especially for a guy without a thick beard to but through.</li>
    <li> overall a very good one!!!&lt;br /&gt;however, the blue light of the stand cant be turned off once plugged in&lt;br /&gt;but still, a good one</li>
    <li> I have owned Braun Razors for 20 years and never even considered a different razor. When it was time to replace my previous Braun model, I purchased a Braun series 5- model # 550cc and blew through 4 foils in 1 year. When the foils hit the 9-10 week mark, the foils pinched the skin to the point of noticeable cuts and scratches. The Braun 550 cc is now in the recycling center. Perhaps it can be made into a useful product that works properly. Seriously... do not buy this razor!  I am currently using a Panasonic ES-LA63 and am very pleased with this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas S</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He has always used the shave cream/razor method but continually mentioned trying one of these. He really likes it and has found it very easy to operate and clean.</li>
    <li> I love the shaver, it is pretty nice and cool price. The only thing I worried is my account security. Cause I recieved a message said I spent $85 at amazon on 13th Oct. But I didn&#x27;t. May you check it again and tell me what happened to my account?Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> And this is easily the worst of all the Braun razors I have bought.  This thing feels like it is powered by 2 ants in a treadmill, sequestered within the interior base.  What a load of plastic crap.  And speaking of plastic, this is easily the cheapest made Braun I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Oh how Braun has gone so far down hill over the past 7 years.  I long for my old Activator back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will tell you:  I just purchased a Panasonic 4 series (about $130) and it wipes the floor with every Braun product (including the Pulsonic...which I was never a fan) out there.  Panasonic has converted me, a life long Braun user.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave and easy to use. It Doesn&#x27;t irritate face and I like the dock. I Definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Apparently the lowest star that can be given is 1.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this shaver because it is the current model of one I have had for years and has been excellent.  I ordered from Amazon because that&#x27;s where I found the best price.  The cleaning function worked the first time I used it.  The next time I attempted to use the cleaning base, the button jammed and the cleaning base will not work.  Now I am stuck with a defective product because Amazon won&#x27;t take it back.  Braun customer service goes to a call center in some country where all the \\&quot;service\\&quot; rep knows how to do is read a script.  I was told by Braun that I should return the defective product to the retailer where it was purchased -- that&#x27;s right, Braun won&#x27;t take it back either.  BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT ORDERING PRODUCTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED \\&quot;HAZARDOUS\\&quot; AS YOU MAY BE STUCK WITH THEM EVEN IF THE PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace my original Braun.  Same smooth shave.  Same quality appliance.  I like the fact that you can clean the blades and recharge the system all at once.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for bout 30 years, maybe more.  This is the first model that DOES NOT include a plastic cap to protect the shaver foil screen head.  It comes with a zipper case, but the plastic cap is vital to protect the head screen from damage, which might occur if, for example, the shaver were to be dropped while in the case.  Braun has verified that the cap is not included with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Braun!</li>
    <li> This razor does a great job!  I love the cleaning system.  At first I thought it was gimmicky and just a way for the company to sell you something every month.  But I have got to say, I love having a clean razor once a week!</li>
    <li> Razor works well... we don&#x27;t use the water cleaning feature...</li>
    <li> A replacement for the one I left behind on travel.  A good razor for home and travel use.  Easy to maintain and retains a good charge.</li>
    <li> I used a Ronson electric in the service and got a really smooth shave, good enough for inspection.  Later used a Norelco for many years but was not getting a close enough shave with the floating heads.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would try a higher end screen shaver thinking it would give a superior shave...but sadly I was disappointed.  I use Williams Lectric Shave pre shave and even then it takes forever to get a close shave!  Under the jaw is especially tough and even on the cheek I need to go over and over, circle to left and right so much that it reminds me of the Norelco.  I even put a new cutter and screen on thinking it would do better but I could have saved my money as there was no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the cleaning station as it does as good job and I always have a nice clean razor each time I start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could find a Ronson screen shaver like the one I had 45 years ago I would gladly jump on it!</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  I had a Braun foil razor many years ago.  I liked the shave but didn&#x27;t like the wiskers pouring out when I would shave and hold the razor at an angle.  This one, with the stand/charger/cleaner, doesn&#x27;t have this problem.  It gives me a real nice shave, and quick.  It will take some adapting to the foil vs a rotary, i.e., the way I hold the shaver for a good shave.  I don&#x27;t shave every day.  A few days growth is no problem.  It has a nice sharp trimmer as well.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews......and I am a believer!  Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Easy to use and clean. I would reccommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this Braun Series 5-550cc shaver for a week now and it is well made and easy to maintain with the cleaning system.  Yes, you will have to go over and area more than once but it gets a close and clean shave when you are finished.  The trimmer is also well made and allows one to trim their sideburns and long hair under the neck as it picks up the hair and allows the razor portion to shave them off from there.  It also works well for eyebrow triming as well.  It is lighter than my old series 5 razor and is water proof.  My old Series 5 razor lasted for over 5 years before the trimming portion malfunctioned.  The razor portion still works.  Got a great price on Amazon for this Braun Shaver System with a manufacturer&#x27;s direct discount it cost less than $110.  Yes that is more than the cheaper Braun models you could purchase but they are not as well made and are manufactured in China which they don&#x27;t tell you until you read this information at the bottom of the container, while this model is pure German engineering and German made which I would buy any time over the Chinese junk out there even if it is supposedly German engineering.  So, you pay for what you get by paying a little more rather than settling for the cheaper Braun models.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself is very useful; I have been getting a cleaner shave with less irritation from the first use (did not even need that \\&quot;adjustment period\\&quot;).  However, there are many Braun shavers that come without the accompanying cleaning system, and it is the system itself that was a rip-off.  The button to activate the cleaning system broke (jammed inside) on its FIRST PRESS - and it did not even activate on that one.  On top of that, separate \\&quot;refill\\&quot; cartridges are sold...\\&quot;refill\\&quot; implies that there was something originally filled.  Not so here: the cleaning system does not come with a package, meaning you must purchase a RE-fill just to use it in the first place.  Horrible advertising and shoddy workmanship on the cleaning system.  Get a shaver by itself and save yourself the rip-off.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new shaver. It gives him a good shave, and the best thing is that it cleans itself. Just put shaver in the holder after use and it charges and cleans itself. Very happy with purchase. Also, the cleaning cartridge lasts a long time. He has owned this for at least 2 months, and the cleaning cartridge is only down a little. I appears that the cartridge will only need to be replaced about every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin with with curly/flat lying hair and this thing cuts incredibly close and doesn&#x27;t leave stray hairs.  If you cant straight shave like me and want the next best thing, this is it.  I really can&#x27;t tell you how shocked I was- I&#x27;ve never gotten this smooth with an electric before.  One thing to note is the trimmer curved? yeah not sure why but It makes trimming sideburns harder than it needs to be.</li>
    <li> Got a Braun 5-550cc Shaver System.Works Great,great price and service.Received before expected.</li>
    <li> I am 53 and had never used an electric razor until recently. I got tired of the hassle and mess of using shaving cream so I decided to try an electric razor. I knew Braun had a good reputation and I didn’t want a cheap electric razor that would hack up my face - or a very expensive one either. So the 5 series seemed like the “sweet spot.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a heavy beard and never look totally clean shaven even with a blade so I wasn’t overly concerned about how close the Braun shaved. After several months of use, I have to say I love the convenience of using an electric razor. It doesn’t shave as close as a blade for me. But I simply don’t care. It give me a good shave. Some may disagree but I can tell the difference. Your result may be different depending on your beard and skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to go over my neck several times with the Braun in different directions to get all the hairs off. Especially those hard to see gray hairs - I am 53, remember. So it is not a huge time saver. If I go more than two days without shaving I use a regular razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning unit works fine but is very noisy for quite some time. It sounds like you are shaving again. It’s not a big deal to me either. The cleaning fluid last me a couple months. I buy four pack of refills here on Amazon fairly cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the closest possible shave stick to a blade. If you are looking for a good shave and the convenience of an electric the Braun 5 is a winner.</li>
    <li> Doesnt do a great job shaving. Really have to shave over a bunch a timea</li>
    <li> My son says it&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t know anymore about it.  For the price I hope it holds up well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver for over 50 years.  Shaves have been bad to OK.  With the Braun I find myself feeling my face in amazement of how smooth it is.  No discomfort at all.  The automatic cleaner did not work when I got it.  I sent it back and a new one was delivered 5 days later.  Hard to believe.</li>
    <li> They say you get what you pay for. This razor is not cheap, nor is it anywhere near the most expensive. That being said it delivers a great shave. It is the most comfortable, and closest shave I have had with an electric. I have a very coarse beard and have had to use a blade for my primary shaver most of my life. I keep an electric shaver for touch ups, weekends, and vacations, times when it may not be practicle to go through my usual blade shave process. The braun brand is the only electric shaver that has done a satisfactory job on my beard. This one does such a good job that I find myself using it a lot more often than my last one. My last one died just before Xmas after nearly 30 years of service. I got this one for a Xmas gift and am impressed with how improved it is. The sideburn trimmer works great too. I love the charging dock that cleans and lubricates the shaver automatically with a push of the button. It has a Li- Ion battery for the best performance. I look forward to many years of great shaves with this even if it lasts only half as long as my last one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but i still like my cheap electric plug-in-the-wall shaver better.  Are all wall-powered ones better than battery ones?</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  Wish I&#x27;d gotten a Braun years ago.</li>
    <li> not good for that price</li>
    <li> charge last along time and the shave is close &amp; comfortable. I like the option of fixing the shaver head in place or letting it move for the neck shaving, one of the hardest places to get a close shave. this performs exceptionally well.</li>
    <li> head of this product the finish peels off..</li>
    <li> I like it very much.  It&#x27;s quieter and gives a much better shave than my last shaver.  The cleaner/recharger is easy to use.  I hope it will last me for many years.</li>
    <li> I did not like it. It does not perform as well as my 5 year old Braun series 7 razor. I found the foil dragged against my skin and the ergonomics where not as good for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun razor. The first one lasted over 8 years but the cleaner gave out and then I could only use it with the cord. This new one shaves must closer. The cleaner is a little louder than the first one. But over all very happy with. This one.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver but it doesnt get all my neck hairs so I need to use the side burn trimmer to get that spot. I like the scent that it gives after you clean it, and it looks stylish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have the shaver system for over a month now and I&#x27;ve had it on the road for two weeks. WOW, works great, cleans tiself and manual cleaning is very easy.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun shaver over a 20yr span.  The trimmer on my series 3 broke and I decided to go for an upgrade this time around.  The shave is rediculously good.  The cleaning/charging system seems like a step up as well despite very similar appearance.  Overall, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I used a Braun 7680 for many years, and when the battery stopped holding a charge, I decided to upgrade to the new 5-Series. That was a huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5-Series shaver itself seems better in many ways than the old 7680 (style, comfort, water resistance, etc.), but the foil and cutting blade a absolutely INFERIOR. I have NEVER had a shave with the 5-Series that has not pulled my hair repeatedly... very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the shaver foil and cutter seem to wear out very quickly. I have only had this shaver for a little over a year, and for the past few weeks my wife has been asking me if I forgot to shave, even though I have. And I spend at least 10 minutes shaving, whereas with the old 7680, I was done in 2.5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a step backward for Braun. I think their new foil and cutter are the culprit. Bad design, bad manufacturing, who knows. But I would certainly NOT recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> My third one, I give them to relatives when  a new one comes out. Love the long lasting replaceable cutter. Build to last and quality shaver.</li>
    <li> Update (2015): I do not recommend this product at all. It has a proven history of failing (the basin is poorly constructed and is prone to malfunction). As noted below, this is the second Braun razor (same model) that I have purchased that has malfunctioned since 2012; the first one was not purchased on Amazon. The basin has ceased to function and Braun is telling me that I have to pay to ship it to them for repair. I find the entire customer service process with Braun dissatisfying and to have to spend more money to repair a relatively expensive product that has failed me in the same way before is bang out of order.   --------------------  I ordered this to replace the same model that I purchased in 2011 while living abroad in the United Kingdom. The previous model still works, but the base ceased to function as a result of different wall currents in the UK and US. This is a common issue when bringing electronics from country to country, hence why I was happy to purchase a new model from the US because other than the aforementioned issue, I have not had any complaints about this model!</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 5 550cc is very comfortable to use and it shaves very close. I would recommend it to anyone who has been shaving with an electric razor for a long time, but has become disenchanted with the results. The Braun Series 5 550cc has restored my faith in innovation for that company.</li>
    <li> my husband was skeptical about this gift, but now is a total fan.  It&#x27;s been 6 months and the light hasn&#x27;t turned on yet to warn him to replace the blades.  shaves amazing. He wouldn&#x27;t go back to his old ways. totally love it.</li>
    <li> I had an older Braun shaver and replaced the cleaner twice because it would not attach to the shaver, I won&#x27;t have that problem with this one. Also the noise level is much lower.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver and a great brand. i have used the Braun brand of shaver for the past 20 years. I have owned two before this one. Each shaver has given excellent service for long periods of time. I really like this shaver over the past two, as it has newer features and gives close comfortable shave. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my first Braun shaver and I am very happy with it. I get a close comfortable shave and it is QUIET. I didn&#x27;t think I would use the cleaning system, but it seems to work well also.</li>
    <li> works well, wish the cleaner cartridges would last longer. the foil blade already needs to be replaced after very infrequent use.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands second Braun unit, the first one lasted about 6 years. Purchased on Amazon due to price. Local retailers were $20 a $30 more. We also purchase the refills on Amazon. Overall very satisfied. The unit seems to stay very clean. We replace the foils about every 8 months or so for optimal performance.</li>
    <li> -Very good quality-comes with a nice case. Take cleaner module out and recover after each use- it will last longer. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the shave, having never previously used an electric shaver. Would definitely buy another Braun again.</li>
    <li> I may not have read the product description well enough, but all my other Braun shavers have a plastic cover that fits over the foil and a case that is large enough for the shaver and the electric cord.  This one has neither (the case just fits the shaver;  no cover for the foil).  The shaver itself seems to be what I&#x27;d expect from Braun (just used once so far), but the lack of these items makes this pretty much a shaver for home only.  Since I travel a lot, this is an issue for me.  I&#x27;ll investigate other options from Braun, as I think they produce quality product.</li>
    <li> I have had Braun razors for quite a few years. I am glad that I am able to buy razors that aren&#x27;t made in China. The Germans put our a quality product.</li>
    <li> This shaver did not fully met my expectations because a couple hours after shaving it feels like I did noting.&lt;br /&gt;That is in comparison to my old Braun. The shaver did not always grab - as advertised - longer hairs laying flat on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it handles well and I got used to it over time.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning unit seem to work fine but it may get expensive in the long run regarding the re-fills.</li>
    <li> Chose this model because it was made in Germany.  Works well.  Holds charge for a long time even when used daily.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun razor.  My first one lasted around 10 years before I opted to replace it, my last one I dropped in the sink and cracked the frame so i could get wet any longer and also broke the trimmer so that was my fault.  Now i decided to upgrade to a series 5, all I can say is WOW, I thought my older Brauns gave a close shave.  This new Series 5 blows them away, I can only imagine what the next model up can do.</li>
    <li> My son received this shaver for Christmas and suggested it for my husband. My husband has never gone &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; but has now used this shaver exclusively since he received it and seems quite happy with it. (I think we have a convert!!!)  Anyway, they both like the self cleaning feature and the ease of use afforded by this shaver. Good investment...thank you! As it was a gift, I was happy with the perfect condition and excellent speed of arrival.</li>
    <li> I rated this shaver a 4 because it&#x27;s a Braun and it cleans itself. It&#x27;s not as good as the series 7 which I rated a 5, but the price is about half that of the series 7 . The foil looks to be the same as the series 7. If you are on a budget this one is great, if you have the money, the series 7 is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;I have both and use both.</li>
    <li> Great shave time and time again just wish it could get under the chin on the throat a little bit better but Great shave</li>
    <li> This is a great electric shaver , it will not&lt;br /&gt;disappoint you.  Shaves very close and with&lt;br /&gt;the cleaning system/charging station it comes&lt;br /&gt;with it makes it a sweet deal.  I would definitely&lt;br /&gt;recommend this shaver or any Braun shaver .</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong. It&#x27;s a  Braun. My dad swears by them. Kind of pricey but I got a great deal from my Amazon Prime membership.</li>
    <li> After many many years of straight edge razors this is hard to get use to, and I don&#x27;t think I get as close of a shave!</li>
    <li> Unreliable. I have used Braun shavers for years, alternating between the 5 series and the 7 series, replacing them annually. However, the last three new Braun razors have been completely unreliable and faulty, and I can no longer recommend buying this brand. The on-off switches are defective, and within several months of purchase, all three began to turn themselves off and on randomly while in use. Eventually, they became unusable and had to be tossed and replaced. Because I had perhaps 15 years of positive experience, I actually bought new ones thinking I had a rare lemon, but no, every one I&#x27;ve bought for three years now has been a piece of junk. So, sorry to say, Braun is just another brand that has compromised standards and cheapened manufacture to the point they are not worth owning.</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver.  It has been a couple weeks and I&#x27;m loving it.  Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor, but it&#x27;s close enough for me.  Easy cleaning as well.</li>
    <li> There is so much about it that he really likes (as oppose to his previous shaver, which was a Norelco.)  The battery is not sensitive to when it needs to be charged - so it&#x27;s not like he has to drain it before charging - so he never runs out of charge.  He also likes the fact that he can plug it directly and use it, if he did run out of charge.  He thinks the base is much more spill proof than his other one.  And, of course, it gives him a good shave and also in less time than his other one.</li>
    <li> Gift for son, said the trimmers worked great!</li>
    <li> Now that have started to use it I find it very good and practical,faster than the series 3 and with the cleaning device it is always perfect for use!</li>
    <li> The directions and diagrams were very hard to understand.</li>
    <li> lightweight and powerfull, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor.  I bought it because I&#x27;m lazy and really hate shaving. So .......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job ... if you&#x27;re not lazy and hate shaving.  What I mean is, if I let my beard go a day too long then the Braun is a little more uncomfortable.  It will still shave me but it seems to rip through the beard and I have to make multiple passes.  So if I can just adjust to shaving daily or every other day it rocks. I&#x27;m not sure if it gives the closest shave for an electric as I have no comparison but I don&#x27;t mind the shave it gives me.  Is it blade smooth? No.  Is it smooth? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning system really does work well and I love that about it.  Because -- did I mention I&#x27;m lazy?  :-)</li>
    <li> It does the job. Needs more than a few strokes to catch all the hair. Will probably go for the Series 7 after this one just to see the difference.</li>
    <li> Best electric shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 5 550cc is Very good shaving system, Clean the base is very easy to use. Very clean shave.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really need or like having the base/cleaner on the counter but still the best electric shaver on the market.</li>
    <li> I have used several Brauns.  Did not think they could get better.  This is the closest, fastest shave from an electric ever.  Quiet operation and good charge life.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who bought this as a substitute for using a razor in the shower. I have sensitive skin and I get zillions of cuts from a razor in the shower that cause my legs to burn all over and bleed some even when I&#x27;m very careful. I tried some &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s electric shavers&amp;#34; and pretty quickly decided they were all junk...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is really great!&lt;br /&gt;- It mows through hair (this should be obvious, but I&#x27;ve tried a few electric razors and they are NOT all good at cutting hair)&lt;br /&gt;- I get a close shave (for my case, I get a better shave with this Braun than I do with a regular razor because of how careful I have to be with a razor).&lt;br /&gt;- It does not irritate my skin. It even works on my armpits and bikini area without irritation. A little skin wrinkle does NOT result in razor rash like it did with my woman&#x27;s electric shaver. I think this is because the foil holes are much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just spent a week in the Caribbean that would&#x27;ve been a nightmare with a razor having to shave every day. It was great and no big deal with this Braun. Just try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver changed the game for me, I highly recommend it for other women! For guys... I&#x27;ll leave you to the other men&#x27;s reviews. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: How close of a shave I get does depend on how much pressure I apply. I have to be careful not to push too hard, but I&#x27;ve got a good feel for it now. I start off gently, and increase pressure on a second pass where it left it feeling rough. I am careful to notice that the temperature of the razor head doesn&#x27;t get too high, which would indicate I was pushing too hard and causing too much friction.  Usually, it&#x27;s a one-pass razor, thank goodness, because that makes shaving much faster.</li>
    <li> It is a great item for man.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the braun series 1 for 5 years, and it still do a good job!</li>
    <li> I had an older model, but also Braun and self-cleaning.  It finally became time to replace it, and - WOW - it&#x27;s still worth the price.  Even easier to use (though my last one was easy enough), and the closeness of the shave on this is truly surprising.  I honestly don&#x27;t think I could get a closer shave with a by-hand razor, and if I tried, I know I&#x27;d be bleeding in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford this, get it.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun shaver i have owned. This one shaves close and is simple and easy to use. It is as advertised and arrived promptly. No complaints.  John</li>
    <li> My last Braun lasted 7 years of being used almost everyday. The new one is even better.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how long this one lasts.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from an old-school 3-rotor norelco that would give me some bad razor burn on my neck.  This bad boy is lightyears better!  No more razor burn.  It also takes less passes to shave each area.  Auto clean is pretty slick as well.  The slide-up trimmer on the back of it works great as well.  And it looks like a futuristic, glowing statue in your bathroom :)</li>
    <li> I enjoy using my electric shaver. It was quite expensive, but it performs very well.</li>
    <li> Works really well bought in case I need.to shave my legs really quick!</li>
    <li> Shaving like a pro with this one! No hassles and unnecessary cuts!</li>
    <li> Love this!  Great shave and husband always smells fresh with a clean shaver each day</li>
    <li> Great shaver, shaves very close with no irritation (I use AFTA before shaving).  I had lots of irritation using Gilette high-end razors and switched to the Braun.  I&#x27;ll never go back now!</li>
    <li> Very good better than advertised</li>
    <li> Does not shave as well as series 3.</li>
    <li> This gave me the first shave I&#x27;ve ever had without razor burn. I shower shave with QUALITY shave cream (please stop buying barbasol) and have enjoyed this for over a year now. Unfortunately I left one in a pool of water for too long and it corroded (my fault, not brauns). Guess what, I bought another one.</li>
    <li> I have always used a Braun shaver.  They shave very well and last for a long time.  I bought this because I can no longer get foils for my old Braun.  So far, I am impressed, especially with the self-cleaning system.  This is more expensive than my old shaver.  But since it will last 10 years, on that basis it&#x27;s not so costly.  I would recommend it for the close shave.  It is definitely best for home use and not travel [if you want to use the self-cleaning feature.]</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, this being the most expensive electric shaver I&#x27;ve purchased. But buying new disposable razors every month at nearly $30 (I shave every day, and still have sensitive skin) I decided to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am nothing but please with this shaving system. It disinfects the head so you don&#x27;t get that disgusting smell you would from other electric shavers and is gentle enough that even after a couple days growth it doesn&#x27;t turn my face raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little hard at times to get around my throat, but nothing that some creative funny faces can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I always had problems with shaving, with soft skin and a heavy beard that lays flat. While shopping at a retailer known for good prices, I saw this shaver. I used my Amazon App to look at reviews and their price. Amazon had a better price and I hit the single click buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other razors I have used, this one has never &amp;#34;bit&amp;#34; me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning/charging stand worked better once I figured out that the cleaning button works, sort of. I found I have to push the saver down some while I press the cleaner button. Then it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue I found is that it is easy to put the blade foil cover on wrong. It is just a matter of making sure both ends are fully seated; no big deal.</li>
    <li> I really like the shaver and the product would get all 5 stars, but the self cleaner only does an ok job. It leaves a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this shaver.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Great model! Completely satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Good quality, and excellent price</li>
    <li> I came from a Norelco rotary shaver that never seemed to shave close enough. This Braun blows that out of the water. My manual razor loving roommate is purchasing one now that he has seen how well it works. The cleaning cycle takes about 10 minutes and a few hours to dry. I clean it after every 2 uses. According to Braun the cleaning cartridge should last about 30 days if used once per day.</li>
    <li> just what we wanted, works great</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after a disappointing experience with a Braun 340. This one provides the comfort and quality I was used to from earlier Braun shavers. A very good product, recommended!</li>
    <li> Lives-up to it&#x27;s billing. Still not as close a shave as multi-blade razor, but most convenient, comfortable electric I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancé because his job is so strict about being clean shaven. He loves it! His face is so smooth and it&#x27;s easy to use. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it, works great. Best shaved Tom have ever had. The refills are easy to change and last a month or so.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s last razor was a more conventional looking Braun razor; it finally died after many, many years of good service.  Hated to pay this price range for an electric razor that he just doesn&#x27;t use frequently (maybe once every 1  - 2 wks), but I am happy that I bought it.      The cleaning process, which he really didn&#x27;t care about, turns out to be quite convenient and effective.  After shaving, he removes the head, turns on the razor for about 10 or 15 seconds, emptying most of the clippings,  and then he gives it a light brushing on the top (but not the actual razor edges), and the razor is visually clean (like his previous Braun).     After replacing the head, he places the razor back on in its receptacle/stand, presses the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; button and the cleaning process begins.    Next time he shaves, it looks and shaves like brand new! Also, he says he gets a good shave. I anticipate a long, productive life for this razor.</li>
    <li> Great feel and handling. Unfortunately I think it&#x27;s meant for men who have thin to little hair.  I really wanted it to work but after shaving with a blade for most of my life I kinda knew it won&#x27;t work on me. my hair is thicker and can be a bit longer than most men. I shave about 3 times a week and for anyone who shaves more than that don&#x27;t buy this. It pulls the hair and leaves spots. This is better suited for someone who had thinner hair and doesn&#x27;t have the need to shave add often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking to manual razors because this doesn&#x27;t give the results that a real shave is suppose to have. I&#x27;m sure it works fine but not on me.</li>
    <li> Great,quick,clean shave.</li>
    <li> This replaced an old Braun series 5, but it doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job, I waited several months to review this to be sure it wasn&#x27;t just break in problems. It&#x27;s OK, but I&#x27;d rather have just replaced the 5 series, it was great.</li>
    <li> When he gets around to shaving (lol) he uses this shaver.  No complains equals happiness!  I highly suggest this item if you want easy cleanup.</li>
    <li> Had been a razor and shave cream guy for over 30 years. Switched to Brawn at recommendation of son. Extremely happy with decision! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I found the shave provided by the 550C not to be very close and requires extensive passes to provide a marginal shave. Beware that foil head can easily be inserted incorrectly; if you don&#x27;t pay attention is will go on but be slightly cocked. Once I became aware that this could occur I have been able to avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest avoiding the cleaning system as my experience was not positive. The cleaning system stopped charging the battery on the fourth use and will not clean. It does however, light up so I have a very expensive little blue light in the bathroom. Note that you can charge the razor directly and that it can be cleaned manually. Amazon sells the razor along with a three pack of cleaning solution which is now entirely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The vendor who sold me the razor dropped it back in my lap saying &amp;#34;contact the manufacturer&amp;#34;. The razor is out of its 60 day warranty so that means packing it up and shipping back to the service center and wait for the bill. In the mean time I will go back to my Gillette Mach III although I seem to get fewer and fewer shaves from a blade while the goes from riduclous  to outrageous.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver in conjunction with Williams Lectric pre-shave.  I get an clean, outstanding shave with no irritation.  This is an excellent product at a fair price.  It is quite powerful and holds a charge.  I am aware that Braun makes newer models (at higher prices), however I am completely satisfied with this shaver.  I would not only recommend it to all my friends, I would purchase it again if I broke the one I have.</li>
    <li> I had the last model for 5 years and loved it.  This one is more impressive.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used, by a mile!&lt;br /&gt;What man likes to shave? I like the 5500cc since I can shave before I shower. Actually, the instructions say that you should NOT wash your face prior to use. I have ignored that a couple times, and it did not perform as well and irritated my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bought this is that I was diagnosed with cancer in Dec. 2013.&lt;br /&gt;I had a great head of hair, but not after the chemo. Now I sure didn&#x27;t want to have to use the Mach 3 on the ole noggin so I researched this and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;It has been great! Not once, since I received it, have I used the ole lather and blades. (That says a lot)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Also it gets better as you use it as your skin becomes more used to it.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this shaver, best shave I have ever had. I use it daily and love the fact that it came with cleaning system. A great product, which I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, at a good price, and on time!</li>
    <li> My job requires that I shave pretty much daily. Unfortunately, I cant use a razor on a daily basis so I found the Braun. Worked like a gem and I cant get enough of shaving with no irritation. The best part is that it doesnt pull the hair on my face. Never used an electric razor but dont think I&#x27;ll use anything else. Afterall, the razor made my face sore using it everyday but not this</li>
    <li> My favorite shaver, battery must be recharged every third day &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband. He was very excited. He had bad acne as a young man and hasn&#x27;t had good experiences with electric razors. So far....he loves it but he hasn&#x27;t shaved with it yet. It was deceiver on time but our stupid UPS guy left the box out in the rain.</li>
    <li> This device has worked ok for the last year, however the cleaning station is very hard to maintain cleaned itself, I already broke one of the two little rubber stands at the bottom which maintain the shaver suspended in the air so it dries up while I was attempting to clean it, the cleaning liquid also dries up fast unless you remove it from the system and cover it back up, the shaver itself is great, I will be looking the more expensive model next time or just change to another brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the fence for months on whether to buy an electric shaver. I have sensitive-ish skin and never particularly looked forward to shaving. This sucker changed that. I find the shave is comparably close to an old school razor....shaving snobs may take offense to that, and it has helped my skin dramatically!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quicker shave&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner shave&lt;br /&gt;Better on skin&lt;br /&gt;Better long term investment (depending on how often you go through razors)&lt;br /&gt;Easy Maintenance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A tiny practically unnoticeable difference in how close the shave is vs a standard razor.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband because the other Braun with the cooling stopped working.  He really likes this even better.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONE GUYS!! It is the most comfortable shaves I have ever had with an electric razor. I highly recommend the Braun Shaver System!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers my entire life and have always had good luck with them.  I have an old 7526 series that still works when plugged in, but the battery is shot.  My father gave me a 9585 model he hardly used and have been using that, but It doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close, so I would always finish up with my old one. I think its because of the newer style floating &amp;#34;pulsonic&amp;#34; heads.  I purchased a 3 series recently and used it a couple times, but ended up taking it back.  It seemed to shave a little closer than my  9585 for the most part, but didn&#x27;t have the power the other ones did.  I was hoping the 5 series would have more power, and it showed it doesn&#x27;t have those stupid springs in the head unit, so I thought it would shave closer.  I&#x27;ve used the 5 a couple times and I&#x27;m satisfied with the closeness of the shave, but it still doesn&#x27;t seem to have the RPMs of the older 95 and 75 units.  I guess I&#x27;ll just have to go a little slower.  The build quality is down from the others it seems, but if it lasts as long as they did, I will be happy.  The 5 shows its made in Germany and has the Lithium battery.  The 3 had the nicad battery, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it was a China product.</li>
    <li> It was not the Same model that I previously purchased - it has fewer LEDs to indicate remaining power.  Not a big deal because the shape, foil cover and overall design provide the same excellent shave as other Series 5 shavers.</li>
    <li> More noisy than my older model.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with the Braun Series 5 shaver.  He stated, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve. Always wanted one of these.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This razor is still going amazingly well for me.  I bought this the summer before my sophomore year of college, and as I&#x27;m about to graduate this spring, I still haven&#x27;t replaced the actual shaver block.  It still has a great shave, and it charges and cleans as it should (I bought a few sets of the refills on Amazon on Subscribe and Save).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major perk was when I went abroad as a junior, I was able to plug this into the shaver sockets in England, and it charged just fine.  Really great shave, phenomenal price.</li>
    <li> A gift and he was thrilled with it...</li>
    <li> The shaver is just a little bit closer than the Braun series 3. I really like the movement of the head better than the Braun series 3. I really like the self-cleaning station it seemed to help greatly in keeping it clean. I must mention I only clean it when the razor tells me too. I don&#x27;t clean it after every shave. I think it is superior to the Phillips Norelco kind. I have had both kinds and I prefer the Braun even though it is louder. The main problem I find is that the only way to get the solution for the recharging cleaning station is to buy online. I can&#x27;t find it at any local stores. Which sucks.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old one I had for YEARS. Like the look and the feel. Handle not as wide easier to grip. Uses the same cleaning solution so I still use the ones left from my old shaver is a PLUS</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I cannot use rotary style shavers. Even if I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I would still prefer this style as it shaves MUCH closer. I have had experience with Braun, Panasonic, and high-end Philips Norelco systems and this is one is by far my favorite. Panasonic tends to grab my hairs, and rotary-head Norelco systems do not shave close enough - making me look like a homeless guy in most cases. The cleaning dock works VERY well. As other reviewers have suggested, only clean it once a week so you can make the cleaning solution last (make sure you cap it after each use as well!). Otherwise it will evaporate too quickly.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> great shaver plus all equipment with it like the cleaning base etc...best i have used in the 50 yrs ive been shaving!!!!!!!!....says my husband which i bought it for him as a gift</li>
    <li> My son will be happy with this on Christmas morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and then noticed my two teenage boys coming to our bathroom more and more until I realized it was for the shaver...to make a long story short...I have bought 3 and they all love it!!!!!! I&#x27;m a happy mother and wife!</li>
    <li> This is the first shaver for our teenager son.  It was the perfect shaver to start with and plus my husband uses the same.</li>
    <li> This series 5 shaver works much better than the series 3 it replaced.  It picks up the hairs no mater which direction they are growing.</li>
    <li> I have owned one before. It is a great shaver and trimmer. I also love the cleaning system. The last one I had lasted for 5 years only having to change the head a couple of times. A great product for me.</li>
    <li> I had an older Series 7 shaver and thought this would beta good replacement. I was disappointed with it and am exchanging it for a new Series 7.</li>
    <li> Never liked electric razors but this one is very good.</li>
    <li> The stand is really cool and the charge for this thing lasts a loooong time. I charge mine once or twice a month. The trimmer is keeps hair really even and it&#x27;s super simple to clean with a brush or just let the stand do the work for you.</li>
    <li> This is a solid, smooth shaver. That&#x27;s what you want, right? I have owned Braun before, and find this Series 5 550cc shaver to be far ahead of the Series 3 model I bought a few years ago in an effort to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a lighter weight than the other Braun shavers I have used over the years, and I like that. It does not feel cheap or flimsy, just more comfortable in your hand. The trimmer is positioned well, such that holding the shaver in a vertical orientation puts the trimmer blade against the hairline. Another Braun, in the Series 3 family, required the shaver to be held in an awkward horizontal plane to put the trimmer against the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted to pick at the pieces, I would say the charging/cleaning base is rather tall, and the head does not swivel much. Neither of those are critical features.</li>
    <li> Great product my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Works great. Delivers a close shave - and that is coming from a guy who shaves with the latest multi-blade technology everyday! Read other reviews for ideas on how to save/extend the life of the washing fluids etc. I use this exclusively for travel most often for 4 day trips every other weekend.</li>
    <li> I have not one complaint.</li>
    <li> This shaver does not work as well as my older Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Had issues with the foil getting a sharp piece coming loose.  This happened after 5 months after purchase.  They replaced the foil, but it happened again 4 months later.&lt;br /&gt;Braun customer service was not helpful.  Asked me to mail it back to them (I was to package and pay for shipping).&lt;br /&gt;When I complained about it they offered to reimburse me for the shipping after I sent it to the service center out of state.&lt;br /&gt;I asked them to mail me a new one and I would send the old one back in the box.  They refused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning unit doesn&#x27;t do a good job either.  A lot of stubble remains in the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, after cleaning the shaver in the cleaning unit, you have to remove it and set it on the counter to dry. Otherwise the shaver has residual alcohol  that gets on your face the next time you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money I would have expected better.  I&#x27;m going to try another brand.</li>
    <li> This works very well for me.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave, overall  nice razor.</li>
    <li> This is my third shaver in the self cleaning line and the worst by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;-Looks good&lt;br /&gt;-Compact body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;-fails to self clean frequently&lt;br /&gt;-when it does clean, it doesn&#x27;t clean well, my previous 5 series looked brand new after cleaning, this one always has clippings left&lt;br /&gt;-trimmer is right where my fingers go to hold it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a step backwards, I&#x27;m going to take the new blade/head and put it on the old razor.</li>
    <li> Um... it doesn&#x27;t shave. Guess we got a lemon?</li>
    <li> This is a serious upgrade from the Series 300 I owned.  Better shave and automated cleaning system are the major advantages.  Still not as good as a blade but getting closer.</li>
    <li> I would give this 0 stars if I could. This is the most horrible electric shaver I have ever owned &amp; I wish I had sent it back. In the 5 months since I have had it, I have not been able to get a close smooth shave. It&#x27;s noisy, irritating to my face, &amp; awkward to try &amp; use. The only thing I have good to say about it is that the recharging stand &amp; cleaner are nice &amp; work ok. I just went back to my old Norelco 8840XL &amp; got the closest, smoothest, quietest, most comfortable shave I have had since I bought this.</li>
    <li> Beware.  If you need to return this Amazon purchase, you will be disappointed. Unlike most Amazon items, including many big-ticket ones, the Braun Series 5 550cc Shaver System &amp;#34;...can’t be returned since it requires special transportation and handling...&amp;#34;  This assertion is of course suspect, as the shaver is routinely delivered in Amazon&#x27;s shipping container of sturdy cardboard and would require nothing more out of the ordinary than the usual well-oiled UPS pickup routine to have it returned, safe and sound, to its point of origin.</li>
    <li> He loves it even more than his last Braun shaver!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver approx. seven weeks ago and did not want to write a review until I had some use with it. The shaver was a replacement for a Panasonic # ES8243 that I have been using for the past 5 years or so, it needed new cutters and foil but otherwise served me well. The cost of these items would have been around $52-$56 plus shipping, that got me to thinking about a new shaver, the hunt was on! I&#x27;ll be up straight the Panasonic is an excellent product and I intended to replace with another, that would have cost well over $100 dollars. The more I shopped around and surfed the Juke Box it was evident the Braun 550C was going to be my target, this is after shopping the usual stores and reading endless reviews. I purchased the Braun 550C with the Cean and renew station.&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t fall for the add-ons and gadgetry but by using Amazons pricing and incentives I was able to buy the product for around $70 and free shipping, I am happy that I did! After about a week of break-in I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to get a closer shave without removing some facial skin. I use the Clean and renew station which really does what it says it will do, it gives you a fresh really close shave and I&#x27;am delighted with the purchase. The cartridges for the Clean and Renew station and with my medium beard I should get about a month and half from one cartridge, this is cost effective. I have already purchased a Braun Series5 cutter and foil set ( around $39 at Walmart ). Great product at a really good price from Amazon. You will no buyers remorse with the purchase of this shaver.</li>
    <li> nice close shave, much better than my former rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband hate it this. He said this was not good at all, it did not shave his face right away only after 6 or 7 times...</li>
    <li> My dad love it, good product!</li>
    <li> I had an older series 5 that had a lcd display that actually told you things about the shaver.  Sadly I dropped that one and it bounced off the sink and into the toilet.  This one has three LEDs with small vague text next to them.  Does the &#x27;clean&#x27; light tell me that it is clean or that it needs cleaning?  I shouldn&#x27;t have to take out a manual to use a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem is that, after 3 or four shaves the return hole on the cleaning base gets clogged with hair causing the fluid overflow over the counter, where it does nothing to clean the shaver.  I could clean the base before use but if I&#x27;m going to do that I might as well just clean the shaver itself.</li>
    <li> Still getting used to it.  It gives a very close shave.  I am on the original cleaning pack and have only used it one time.  Replacements are fairly expensive.  I hope it last a long time if I clean the shaver once every two weeks.</li>
    <li> In my opinion the the clipper part is good, the size and feel is great and the cleaner works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base is huge, takes up too much real estate on my vanity, the wall wart to supply power is designed to not block the other outlet which is good but because of its shape it sticks out about 5&amp;#34; from the wall and in my case it causes the coiled cord to hang out over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it continually misses a lot of hairs and I tend to notice this when I get to work where it is too late. So today after skipping a day of shaving I decided to count how many times it takes to go over the same spot. I went over my cheek 8 times (4 time in each direction), the end result was several missed hairs. I have tried shaving before and after showering and did not see much improvement either way. I might try a gel or foam, but need to see if this unit works with it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the although the razor is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull on hairs it does not seem to perform as well as old Norelco three head design unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this one until it needs a new blade and refills, then I might just go back to a high end Norelco.</li>
    <li> My son likes it and it was a good price!</li>
    <li> I had an older Braun 5 series shaver for about 8 year roughly. I liked that one fine but the sideburn trimmer was a bad design so I kept another shaver around just for that. Enter this new series 5. I&#x27;ve used this a few months and I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase. The newer foil design is better and I think it irritates my neck quite a bit less. The sideburn trimmer is awesome. I also like the travel case - it won&#x27;t break like my old one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the charging station but I have not used the cleaning solution so I can&#x27;t speak to that. I just wash it under tap water every few shaves. Ideally the station would have a little smaller footprint, but not a big deal for me. I don&#x27;t mind the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son in law. I looked at the reviews for a few shavers and decided to buy this one. He said it&#x27;s the best electric shaver he&#x27;s ever had .He seems very happy with it. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to go on purchasing cartridges to clean the razor, items that are more expensive than the razor blades this item was meant to replace.... the shaving is only so so.  My old cheaper Braun did a better job.  If I had it to do over I would have looked harder for something else...</li>
    <li> I got my husband this Shaver System for Christmas and he loves it! Especially the self cleaning system ;-) Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had rotary head and foil shavers before. Most recently a Panasonic foil. This Braun, however, beats &#x60;em all, in terms of shaving comfort and closeness. I&#x27;d recommend it, even though the clean &amp; renew system is a continuous expense. The razor will say it needs cleaning after every couple of shaves, but I&#x27;ll normally give it a &#x27;tap-wash&#x27; then do the full cleaning after a couple extra shaves. There&#x27;s no drying element in the C&amp;R system, so after cleaning (&amp; charging) it&#x27;ll just sit there with the cleaning indicator blinking...for 4 hours...until it shuts off. In my experience, you can remove it from that cycle and set it out to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another hint..... A 3-pack of the cleaning cartridges can be picked up at Target for the same general price as is sold by most Amazon merchants.</li>
    <li> Great deal and great razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Does fine job with shaving. Like the trimmer too. Cleaning system really makes a difference with quality of shaves.</li>
    <li> Compared to my old panasonic Arc 3 this razor is terrible. I decided to buy this one because it was on sale for $60 and my panasonic is nearly 2 years old and just doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge any more.    The Braun doesn&#x27;t give nearly as close a shave as the Panasonic did and the head doesn&#x27;t flex as much.    I do like having the ability to shave while the unit is plugged in. The Arc 3 didn&#x27;t have this feature.    Update:     Still hate it. Does not get as close as the Panasonic razors at all. Cuts skin pretty well though! I believe I paid around $60 for this razor and now it&#x27;s back at $120. Definitely wasn&#x27;t even worth $60. For $120 you can get a really nice Panasonic.</li>
    <li> works better than expected probably because my previous shaver was beyond horrible. battery life is awesome. shaves are quick. only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; is that the cleaning cycle takes a long time so its best to do overnight when needed. save money and buy the series 5 version. i cant imagine that the higher series models are that much better</li>
    <li> After using a Norelco, three circle shaver for twenty years, I found this shaver to be quite a treat.  When it is stored, the head is in contact with the cleaning fluid, and it makes the shave feel cleaner. The fluid smells a bit like after shave.  I will see how long it lasts.  So far, the charges lasted four weeks, but I only shave two or three times per week.  I find the shaver useful to remove growth after several days of not shaving, then the next day I will use a razor blade to clean it up further.  Overall, I&#x27;m quite impressed with this razor.</li>
    <li> Working well so far! much sharper than my old razer, and almost as close as my gillette razor! alcohol smell from the cleaner is a bit strong on the shaver after rinsing, even days after. Also it would be nice if there was a cover for the razor, as i dont always leave it in the base, or would like one when travelling with it</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver system. The first one lasted close to ten years and I was very happy with it. The feel of this one is a little different, and almost feels too small in my hand. Other than that, it gives a great shave and the cleaning system is good.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS BRAUN SHAVER. GIVE&#x27;S ME A VERY CLEAN AND SMOOTH SHAVE. EASY TO CLEAN AND USE. IF YOU WANT A GOOD AND RELIABLE SHAVER, THIS IS THE ONE.</li>
    <li> This shaving system is the best.  I am getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  The automatic cleanser works great and keeps the razor working like new every shave.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN OLD SYSYTEM BUT ONE THAT WORKS AS WELL IF NOT BETTER THAN THE NEW ONES.&lt;br /&gt;AND THE REPLACEMENT CLEANER IS A THREE PAK WHICH IS A GREAT DEAL</li>
    <li> Close shave, cleans well, and trimmer does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have owned electric razors for over 40 years.  Norelcos and Brauns.  They were pretty good, but never shaved as close as this Braun model.  It gives the closest shave I have ever experienced and the shave does not take too long.  Braun got this model right! The automatic cleaning system works well also. I recommend this to everyone to try.  I hope it works out for you.</li>
    <li> I am really surprised that this thing is such a piece of crap, since it had many good reviews. It is clearly inferior to my old shaver, a panasonic ES8243, which finally broke after like 4 years of use. I gave it a couple of weeks to adjust to it. I gave it a couple of months. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be broken or anything, it just doesn&#x27;t work very well for me. I have fine hair and somewhat sensitive skin and I will generally go a few days in between shaves. I think that is the main problem for this machine, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to handle facial hair of any length. But it is just a bad design anyway.    When I go to shave, I will move this thing over an area of my face and it won&#x27;t cut all the hair. It won&#x27;t cut half the hair. It will cut about 30% of the hair. It is really bizarre, moving a shaver over my cheek and seeing so much of the hair still on my face as it passes over it. So, at each pass, it cuts 30% of the hair, meaning I have to take like 7-8 passes over a single area to get what looks like a good shave, with a few stubborn hairs still hiding in places. I have to press pretty hard for it to work in those awkward angles on my neck, and make a bunch of passes, and I have to be super careful or it just rips up my skin. Shaving has become a much longer, tedious, and slightly painful process.    From what I can tell, the problem is it has a foil at either end for short stubble and some clipper like thing in the middle for longer hairs. That is just a sharp, vibrating piece of metal with no guard or anything. I think that is what chops up my skin. I looked at my old shaver, and it is has a similar design (except for an extra foil thing), but the clipper thing in the middle for the longer hair has a guard over it so your skin doesn&#x27;t get in it, and it also uses a different design where the hair will always have a slot to go into. Instead of this Braun one which rather optimistically hopes that the hair will be properly directed into little channels, instead ofjust sliding over the solid flat metal piece. I posted a picture of this on the product page, pointing out the mini face knives in the center.    Anyway, I think this thing is designed for guys who routinely shave every day, so the shaver only has to deal with really short stubble that the foils are designed to handle. That&#x27;s the only thing I can think of. If you shave like that, maybe it will work for you, it doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
    <li> WOW.....I have been using a blade for my whole life and decided to try an electric shaver since I&#x27;m getting Lazy.  I expected some irritation and had very low expectations.....Boy was I wrong!  This razor came today and I had a 2 day beard.  I charged it and let it go through the cleaning cycle.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it....I was Amazed that in the first shave I Loved it.....smooth as a Baby&#x27;s behind with no pull, tug, ouch, irritation or anything.  Love Love Love it. Now I&#x27;ll use it to shave my head instead of using clippers.  Awesome product.  You need one if you&#x27;re thinking about it.....Just buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received my Braun Series 5 Shaver System as a gift and initially though that the motor sounded like it was running quite a bit slower than the Remington shaver that I was used too. However I quickly found out that the Braun gave me as close a shave as the Remington &amp; was much quieter. Another huge plus was that the Foil (and cutting block) on the Braun last about 18 months, where I was replacing the foil on the Remington every 6 months (although the Braun foil &amp; cutting block are a bit more expensive).&lt;br /&gt;In any case I love the no mess cleaning system on the Series 5, which doubles as the charging station. I find the Braun&#x27;s trimmer is as close to perfect as I have had on any electric razor, and it works as well today as the day I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have found that nothing gives you as close &amp; clean a shave as a blade, the Braun comes very close without the nicks &amp; cuts. I can also use this razor to keep my shaved head free of stuble &amp; it holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would buy another Braun when it comes time to replace this razor.</li>
    <li> I would give 0 star if there is a choice. After 1 and half years usage, the battery started falling apart, it only can hold up one time of use, leas than 4 minutes after whole day fully charge. I called their service for repair, and they told me that they can replace the battery for free. First I thought well at least their service was good disregard the poor quality, however, after one month of waiting after mailing the product back to them on my own money, they told me that it needs $80 for replacing the battery on my second following call. (the first follow-up call they still said it needed to take 2-3 weeks to send it back to me). With $80, I can 100% certain that I can buy a much better shaver than this one. Finally they told me either I pay the $80 or they just sent the poor product back to me. What a horrible service!</li>
    <li> Says it all.  I&#x27;m sick of shaving. After many years, I hoped this would work.  Simply not a close shave on certain parts of my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one other Braun shaver that I used until it finally fell apart (over 20 years). This new shaver is a wonder. Self-cleaning function is very nice. Also can be cleaned under a stream of hot water from the faucet. By the way, I find that this extends the life of the cleaning solution since I only use the cleaning solution about 2X a month. I spray a little of that famous W lubricant in between times.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get as close a shave as I thought I would...a bit disappointing. Mabe I&#x27;m expecting too much after  using a straight edge for years!</li>
    <li> i had the first generation of the Braun Series 5 shaving system.  The newer model is just as appointing.  i love it.  i have very sensitive skin and this is the only shaver that does not razor burn my face.  given this shaver, like most electric shavers, will not get as close as a razor, but it does get very close, is risible, and has a very good built in trimmer.  if you want a great electric shaver but do not want to spend the money for the 7 series, i suggest this one</li>
    <li> My fiance absolutely loves this! He has not had irritation at all since beginning to use it, the cleaning function is very useful and not hard at all to keep on top of for refills. I don&#x27;t really need to write a huge review, this product has so many and they are the exact reason I went with this system. I do not regret it at all!</li>
    <li> it worked for one week!</li>
    <li> I was needing a change in shaving methods. So I thought I might see how the electric shavers were doing. Received the shaver a day earlier than expected. Read all the reviews and decided I would try the Braun 5 /550cc shaver system. This is a great shaver !! A real close shave better than I expected from a electric shaver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited a while to submit a review because I wanted to submit an accurate one. This shaver is around $200 at bestbuy and walmart. Even at their prices it would be worth it. It&#x27;s not as close as a high end razor but its very close. I wont be buying razors any time soon.</li>
    <li> Pretty good overall.  I like the cleaning function.  The shave is not as close as I would like however.  I have given it some time, but it still isn&#x27;t as close as a razor.  I do have much less razor burn and irritation than with a blade.</li>
    <li> Really great shaved for a good price.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s 2nd Braun.  We received this in a couple of days and he could not be happier with the performance of this shaver!</li>
    <li> okay so he has had the same Braun Shaver since... FOR EVER ago- i wana say at least 5 years. and it finally just broke, so instead of replacing things i told him id get him one-we looked online and this one got even better reviews than the 7 Series. It is a lil pricey- but Amazon had the lowest price (other than lookin at other websites/ebay). He got it the other day and used it ASAP..... and.... OMG. Just straight WOW!!!!!! his face has never look THAT closely shaven- and it is SOOO SILKY SMOOTH OMG OMG OMG! there is absolutely NO stubble whatsoever, it is the smoothest i have ever seen and felt his face. He also has extremely sensitive facial skin (like most) but days after using this, still NO bumps or ingrown hairs or anything. this is amazing, AND it has a cleaner when your done!!!!!! So simple, so affective, SUCH A GREAT PRICE and PRODUCT! Guys look no further, and girls- get this baby if your man needs a new shaver, or if he has trouble finding one!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband because he began a job where he has to shave every day. He loves this shaver! Some of his co-workers said they are going to get one too after seeing his.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who can&#x27;t use a razor due to sensitive skin. He loves it! The self cleaning function is very convenient and it gives him a nice close smooth shave with little effort! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This shaver is my third Braun shaver in about 17 years.  I started with their cheapest model while I was still in high school.  It was excellent.  When it died, I upgraded to the \\&quot;360 complete\\&quot; with the self cleaning system.  It was even better.  Some people complain about the cost of the cleaning refills, but to me it was worth it to have such a close, clean, effortless shave.  After about 7 years the battery started dying in my 360 so I told the wife to pick me up a new Braun for Christmas.  She got me the Braun series 5.  At first I though maybe my face just needed to get used to the different cutter head, but after a couple of months it was not getting any better.  I also tried all variations of the \\&quot;sensitivity\\&quot; setting.  I contacted Braun and explained that I was not getting a close shave and that I had to make multiple passes at different angles to get it to cut.  They said it must have a bad foil/blade and sent me a new one (free of charge).  I have now used the replacement for about a month and there is no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the series 5 is not a bad shaver, it is surely not a great one.  And when compared next to either of the previous Braun&#x27;s I have owned it is left severely wanting.  I am not sure if it is the smaller shaver head, or the different pattern of the foil, or what.  At the end of the day I kick myself for throwing away my old Braun as I could of just used it as a corded shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an existing Braun user thinking about upgrading, DON&#x27;T.  Keep your old razor and you will be far happier in the long run. For me I will be going back to a blade to shave with (as it is faster to shave with a blade than with the series 5), while I search for an electric that can compare to the product that Braun used to produce.</li>
    <li> Works better than Blades. Takes a little longer but does not nick or irritate. Travel case is perfect</li>
    <li> best shaver ever.  nice clean shave.  The best  part is the self cleaning .  Appreciate never having to clean the shaver manually.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It gives a close clean shave and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My second purchase of a Braun shaver for my husband. First one finally failed after seven years. He likes the Braun&#x27;s very much. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> My face hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth since I used a razor about 5 years ago. I can&#x27;t use those because I have sensitive skin, so this definitely fills in the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was trying to decide between this and paying another $50 for the Series 7 790CC. I&#x27;m glad I went with this one, as it does just what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, so the extras on the series 7 might help those with a thicker beard</li>
    <li> best electric shaver I have ever owned. The cleaning part of it is just window dressing so buy a less expensive version, it cleans just as well under faucet water. Had to have a repair and the service was prompt and courteous, they even sent a complimentary pocket shaver to keep while they service mine!</li>
    <li> He said it was smooth shaving.  Good. It cleans itself.  Just a good shave.  Buy it.  Worth the money.  Yay.</li>
    <li> Good value for a better than average razor.  Trimmer is excellent also.  Easy, comfortable handle to use with either hand.</li>
    <li> The alcohol wash unnecessary part of cost-cleans up very well under running hot water.Shave OK only after repeated going over same area!</li>
    <li> Mine was in a holiday pack that had a free battery travel razor &amp; 2 extra cleaning cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately i never made it threw the extra cartridges before the pump in the Clean &amp; renew base died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself works great even on stubborn thick hairs. Holds a charge well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean by hand. Cord can be plugged into razor bottom instead of into cleaning stand if desired.</li>
    <li> it just doesnt shave veary well</li>
    <li> not satified with  cutting. not a close shave,and always have to use  an old shaver to cut beard that&#x27;s missed by this shaver..</li>
    <li> Works great and smaller base than older models</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  It works great!</li>
    <li> it does not cut as close as stated or as excepted</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  Bought an electric razor many years ago and assumed (incorrectly) that they had much improved in the intervening years.  Bad decision.  Unless you have a very light beard or happy with a poor shave stay with what you have.</li>
    <li> I always like Brauns, but this latest one is the best--fast and clean shaving.  The LED signaling system is unintelligible.</li>
    <li> The shaver works like a charm, but the instructions were somewhat skimpy (and not too clear particularly on the use of the cleaning unit &amp; washing with water as an alternate).  Thus 4 out 5 rating.  I have recommended the Braun brand to a friend.</li>
    <li> 10 years ago my mom bought me a Norelco shaver that kept with the shave gel in it. She said it was expensive, but wouldn&#x27;t say how much it actually was. I was only in my mid teens back then, with very little hair on my face. That razor was the most painful thing in my life. It completely turned me off to electric razors. I swore agains them for over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to 2012 when I was forced to buy a travel razor, the Braun M60B. My first few shaves were very similar to the sandpaper Norelco I had back in the day. Unfortunately I had no choice but to use it as we had no water for my manual razor. After a couple of weeks I got the hang of using the M60B and it became my fulltime deal. I used recharging batteries to keep the cost down. I have used it solely for somewhere around 4 months. My only complaint was that it takes forever to shave with it. Lots of running over the same area again and again. Last night I ran across the Braun 550cc at Target with the extra trimming package as a holiday deal. I figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 550 blew me away. It is VERY quick, and comfortable. Even in the problematic areas for my M60B, the 550cc has no issues with just one or two swipes. For my quick review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving: 5 stars. Very close and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build Quality: 5 stars. The base is solid, the razor feels good in the hand. There is no rattling or destructive vibrating. The way the base closes down on the cleaning solution is solid also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool Factor: 5 Stars. It looks really nice. The blue lights on the base are upscale looking. It has lights indicating the charge level, cleaning cycle, and how much solution is left for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Process: 3 stars. It scores low because you have to let it dry for four hours. The cleaning solution smells amazing, but the wait time is a little silly. I know you can shave and then clean it, but at this price point I wouldn&#x27;t expect my razor to be out of action for four hoursa day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip of the hat that Braun deserves is the instruction book. The triple fold design allows you to see a numbered diagram of all of the parts, pieces, and lights on the shaver and the base regardless of the page being viewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add to the review as time goes on.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my husband for Christmas and not it does not get charged and the cleaning system does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it through amazon.com and  AMAZON doesn&#x27;t give the option to exchange or return the product.  There is not an option to contact customer service either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been an amazon customer for over a decade and it is so disappointing.</li>
    <li> The shaver works fine but the charging/cleaning station broke after one year&#x27;s use. It sprayed cleaning fluid all over the bathroom counter top. The charging/cleaning station looks and feels flimsy and cheap. Braun warranty repairs are a nuisance and you pay shipping to their repair facility. Braun charges a hefty $42 plus shipping for replacement charging/cleaning stations. This doesn&#x27;t include the electrical plug/transformer/cord, which is extra. And they are out of stock on the replacement charging/cleaning stations, so third parties are charging $65 plus shipping for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent my defective charging/cleaning station in for repair and Braun replaced rather than repair it.  But the replacement station has a new problem.  When the cleaning cycle activates the electrical motors, the resulting vibration causes the electrical contact points on the station to lose contact with the ones on the shaver.  That causes the cleaning to stop just as its getting started.  If I restart it, it runs for a while, sometimes to completion but often it stops again for the same reason.  This is a real pain.  Needless to say, I’m not very happy with Braun …</li>
    <li> Shaves closer than my 10+ year 7 series. Have a lot of hair that grows parallel to the skin. New five series handles It much much better.  Slowing down and  moving the razor a little slower on the skin gives a closer shave. Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because unsure how necessary the clean and lube bath is. Don&#x27;t know if the the five dollars a month for fluid helps me or Braun or both.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the 7100 series</li>
    <li> This product is good and gives a clean shave. Its kinda costly but you don&#x27;t want to take any risk with your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great!</li>
    <li> I had an older series 5 for about 8 years, and it worked very well with no complaints but finally died after many drops and a long life. I opted for the series 5 again as I have learned that you get what you pay for, as I was looking at a cheaper razor in the 60 - 80 dollar range. I have had this one for about a month and it is better than expected. Excellent shave, great shape and grip. I highly recommend that you spend money on a quality shaver as it can last a very long time!</li>
    <li> It shaves okay.  It runs through the cleaning fluid very fast.</li>
    <li> Gives a much closer shave than the Panasonic model it replaced that was purchased only four months earlier. It has self-cleaning liquid in the base that can be used daily or every two or three shaves depending on your beard. One container of the cleaning liquid is included. I expect to get two months use out of it before replacing it. I haven&#x27;t purchased the refill yet, so you may want to check the price online and consider buying one at the same time you purchase the shaver. A little cleaning brush is included if you don&#x27;t want to use the cleaning liquid every time. The cleaning process takes four minutes and it really seems to work well. The base keeps the shaver fully charged of course, and the shaver can also be used with the cord that attaches to the base in the event it runs out of charge and you need to shave immediately without waiting for a recharge. This is probably not news to you, but since the shaver is for my husband, I didn&#x27;t know all that.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son who has moderate acne and can&#x27;t shave with a blade. He loves it and it should last him a while.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor ever and I am 63 y.o. and it&#x27;s spectacular ,  shave brush it and insert it in the holder/cleaner. It makes a funky cool sound and it cleans itself. I got a fantastic price and I am so very happy!!!</li>
    <li> No complaints at all!</li>
    <li> Great product.  A good replacement to my old Braun Shaver System</li>
    <li> I had an older Braun that lasted a long time and shaved well. I think I was hoping this one would be even better. It may be a little better, but not a lot. It may be unfair to be disappointed, but I was a little disappointed. Still, it is definitely a good shaver.</li>
    <li> It says that it takes 2-3 weeks for your face to get used to it.  OK ... so am I supposed to go to work with bad shaves for 3 weeks? Does Braun pay for the vacation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All electric shavers take getting used to, and I suppose I would have ridden through the first month if I was blown away by the performance of the razor, but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to give me even a decent shave on 1, 2, and 3 days growth.  I really wanted it to work (even read the instructions and changed my shaving methods), but I had to go over my face with a blade, which defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> Replaces my old Series 5, which lasted 6 years before giving up.  This new one works nicely and is very quiet.</li>
    <li> i´m quite well impressed with this product. It looks and feels like it is very well built. The new color scheme of solid black looks classy.</li>
    <li> Cleaning system: Very handy. Hated cleaning these bastards (razor) out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver: Not good on long hair, so use the trimmer. Other than that, not as great as a close shave or using just a razor, but better than most competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: Crap. I don&#x27;t even consider myself to have a thick beard, but I guess this trimmer could not handle a beard of a 24 y/o that is still patchy at places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue was addressed by an Amazon representative. Braun was unable to take the extra step to be done with it and would rather draw out an event to ensure that a consumer has an awful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun offered me a travel trimmer, once they had received my razor... One week. Then another week to get the travel razor to me. Plus another week to send the travel back to them and another week to get mine.....sounds like a month, just for my trimmer to be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;Braun had no guarantee that I&#x27;d get my original razor back, but did guarantee that I&#x27;d receive the same model.... Eww.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazon representative offered a full replacement if there was no option from braun as a one-time thing. Once I called him off of the other line when Braun offered me a month long fix, he said he can give me a new one for 20% off. I called him out for that and then he backtracked and said he would send me a replacement without the need of me sending my broken one back. It is to be delivered Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be weary of ordering products from Braun (Gillette) and will be easier to be persuaded to move away from dependence upon them. Norelco is crappier, but they have policies in place that ensure the best customer experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He LOVES it. He always used regular razor shavers before and has sensitive skin and would get shave bumps. He has not had ONE shave bump or ingrown hair since he started using this. I was skeptical at first because he tried an electric shaver in the past (like the old norelco kind) and didn&#x27;t care for it, but he loves this Braun Series shaver! A definite hit!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very fancy device and pricey cleaning solutions. Still doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my Norelco and can&#x27;t be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> I had used this shaver for about two years and it worked ok. That is, until I dropped it on the (wood) bathroom counter top. The entire top portion of the shaver came apart. I could not simply put it back together as the top 3/4 of the shaver is held together by a very thin and flimsy plastic collar which had broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had expected that I would be able to get this piece from Braun. They informed me that they did not have parts available and instead instructed me to send the shaver to a repair facility and wait for them to respond with a price to repair the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost to have the shaver shipped both ways and pay for a repair did not seem practical to me based on a simple plastic piece breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed with the shaver based on the poor design and lack of durability, but also the lack of foresight to have replacement parts readily available.</li>
    <li> To relate my experience with this, I have a very coarse beard, so when I read the reviews about how painless this thing shaves, I decided to give it a try. After about 2 weeks, I am done. It felt like I smeared honey on my face, walked up to a beehive, and played AC/DC at full volume. I think I qualify for veteran&#x27;s benefits (and the purple heart) after this experience.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving using safety and cartridge razors for years, but have gotten tired of the time and mess.  The Braun Series 5 had pretty good reviews and I liked the idea of the self cleaning cycle.  Once I got it home, I tried using it for several weeks.  I usually had to go over each part of my face numerous times and it would still regularly miss hair along my jaw line, and would barely cut my neck hair at all, frequently requiring me to get out the safety razor to touch up.  Furthermore, if I had let my beard go more than a couple days without shaving, it would repeatedly yank hair rather than cutting it.  The self cleaning thing is pretty nice and seems to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it for a refund after about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old three head razor with this guy, and don&#x27;t regret it one bit! It is a little loud, but not a deal breaker by any means.</li>
    <li> it is really nice and even came with a carrying case so that it can easily be taken on trips</li>
    <li> I have to say, I love this product. Before using this product, I expected every time I shaved that I would at least cut myself even just once; especially around the curve of my chin. With this product, there is no worry of that. I have tough hair but sensitive skin (most of my personality and self is like this; one extreme combined with the other end of the same spectrum), so having this product is just perfect. I was thinking of buying this product sooner, but I have never really made the actual effort until this year. I loved the idea of an electric shaver. Now, I have proof towards my initial thoughts on this product type. This product does not cut you, at all. The instructions and tips for keeping and maintaining it clean are to be followed to the letter as they will ensure that you spend as little on replacement parts as possible. With as long as I have been using this product, I have to say, that it is worth every penny. Of course, do your homework on the product too. Make sure you are buying the right series for your unique type of skin and hair. Also make sure the place where you buy it from, and from who, is as secure as you can get, with any product. Of course, excluding the price is just foolish but that should go with out saying. Overall, as far as its performance is concerned, it does well on all areas. The back blade that is used to do touch ups, whether on the beard, mustache, side burns, or back of the head. I loved how this product worked so well that I got a mirror to do the back of my head. I like the square look like you get at the barber shop. Now, the only time I ever go to a barber shop is to get really good baby face shave done and to get that lemon scent that the barbers use when shaving, just to make myself absolute when I need to look better than my best. Other than that, this has got me so happy, I can&#x27;t touch on all subjects that it does for me (even though this long review looks like I&#x27;m trying). The shaver does take some time to do down to the nitty gritty work on hairs. Though, going over areas especially problem areas is not a big deal to me, some may find it upsetting so I&#x27;m stating it now. Its not a miracle worker; your going to have to go back over areas. If your like me, and don&#x27;t shave every 2 to 3 days (about the time it takes me to get up to a &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;), then your going to need to put in the extra work to get the job done. The handling on curves of the face are flawless. The neck area is great, especially around the Adam&#x27;s Apple area. Always check after your shave for those pesky problem hairs. I don&#x27;t know why, but for me, I always have a few long ones that escaped cutting. After a good shave, I feel so much better. If you buy this product for anything, buy it for the major confidence booster you will get. Your new look will show through your feelings after using this product, and it will be a good feeling. The cleaning station is not the only method of cleaning. The instruction booklet that comes with this product covers a few ways to keep it clean; both on the road and at home. If they ever discontinue this product, or its replacement parts, I will be very, very upset. I know I don&#x27;t have to wait for over a year just to change simple components of this product, but I sure don&#x27;t want to be left with out this product any more. Overall, I love it, I recommend it, and as long as I can keep it way into my 40&#x27;s (which is a far cry from my age right now), then I&#x27;ll be satisfied with this product. I&#x27;ll just put this flat out simple, get this product. Either decided on the series that is right for you, and what each series uniquely gives you as far as what their design is suppose to specialize in, but get this product either way. Do not worry about the price tag, it is worth it. As long as you get it from a source that is trust worthy, reliable and honest, you will &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this product. If I love it, with how detailed I am, and my focus on quality, meaning, and performance, then I know the average guy will just fall in love with this product. Make sure you do your homework on researching this sort of stuff, and go for it. Don&#x27;t hold back like I did for so many years. I hope this review helps you readers out. Now onto my next product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, I have used every brand of shaver and Braun is by far the best!  I currently have a series 3 that I have used for several yrs.  The shaver has performed valiantly, never letting me down!  I am entertaining the purchase of a series 5 or 7 as my next Braun, I will buy nothing else!</li>
    <li> He really likes it. Happy with the close shave.</li>
    <li> What can I say. It is a Braun.  Always gives a good shave and is light weight and easy to clean. Highly recommend this Shaver.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Braun electric razor for years and this one is great. It cuts closely, it is quite and it is easy to use. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Good clean close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning cycle is very satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;Drying cycle takes too long.&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge as expected.</li>
    <li> I find the replacement cost of shaving heads to be a constant drain on my budget.  They do not seem to last very long and are expensive.  The shaver performs wells, but the constant cost of replacing the heads  overrides the rest.</li>
    <li> the price was right. The device works well.</li>
    <li> I used a Norelco rotary for 10 years. I changed the blades regularly. This Braun really cuts through the beard in less time. The automatic cleaning/lubrication system works ok but is not really a necessity if you don&#x27;t want to buy the refills.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Similar to my 700 series in terms of shave and comfort. Only complaint is that carrying case for travel does not hold the cord.</li>
    <li> [updated July 11, 2012]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned my [[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] to the manufacturer during the trial period.  It had a great trimmer, but most trimmers I have used have been acceptable.  Otherwise, the shave and NiMh battery were not so hot and the head does not flex.  My mistake, trying to go cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous shaver had been an old 5 series that still worked some; I&#x27;d give that one 4 stars.  I once went on a 15 day vacation on this NiCad shaver without the charger, when it was a decade old, no problem.  Just had to be sure to drain the battery and then charge completely (which I eventually goofed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new shaver was a [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]], which gave a good shave, but shook itself to death in 26 months.  It&#x27;s now extremely loud, but won&#x27;t drive either the current or previous head.  Trimmer was marginal, but good enough.  This shaver ran 79-80 db at six inches, close to ear damage volume.  Who knows what the equivalent vibrations were, transmitted through my face.  I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June, 2012, I picked up a [[ASIN:B003YJB026 Braun Series 5-550cc Shaver System, Black and Silver]] on sale for one twenty at my local cost company.  Initially, I liked it&#x27;s relative quiet, but I soon became disappointed with the quality of the shave.  Shaving more carefully and taking about 50% longer helps.  I do like that the head is in two pieces (foil and cutter block), which makes shaking out the cuttings a snap.  If you are fair and young (light beard like I had in college), this model will probably be fine.  Older and tougher, not so hot.  On this and the Series 7, I use the cleaning solution about once a week and then cap the cartridge.  72 db at 6 inches, which makes it less than half as loud as the series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my cost company tonight, I snagged a [[ASIN:B0067D4RYY Philips Norelco 1255x Sensotouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black,Special Value Includes Extra Shaving Head Pack]] apparently a 1250x with the extra head, on sale for one five five with a fifteen mail in rebate.  (I still have my old corded Norelco from decades ago, won&#x27;t do my &#x27;stache correctly, so I have been dubious about these shavers.)  I&#x27;ll be posting my 2 star review tonight; this sucker is going back.  (What a relief to switch back to the Series 5, even if it is slow.)  The only really good thing about the 1255x is the noise: 67 db at 6 inches is about a quarter as loud as the Series 7.  (The decibel scale is logarithmic, not linear.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;Update 8-12-2012:  my interpretation of the decibel scale was incorrect.  3db (not 6db) represents a doubling of the sound pressure.  I&#x27;m still using the 5-550cc, which takes at least 50% longer to produce an acceptable shave as my old Series 7.  My credit card provides an extra year of warranty and credited my full Series 7 purchase price to my card, so I&#x27;m probably going to spring for a new Series 7, keep the 5 as a spare.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father for father&#x27;s day. I have the Braun Series 3, and we&#x27;ve enjoyed Braun&#x27;s line of shavers for years. My father (and I) both really like the revamped cleaner system, which is now automatic. As expected, the shaver gives a smooth close shave, and makes for a great shaver for either you or for a gift.</li>
    <li> The new model is even better than the old one.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have had so far. The price couldn&#x27;t be beat either.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband from Santa - but Santa arrived when it arrived.  This is probably 5th Braun he&#x27;s had &amp; best to date - cutting hairs that others wouldn&#x27;t pick up &amp; smoothly.</li>
    <li> This shaver is fantastic in that it is very, very comfortable and still gives a great shave.  Also, the pop-up trimmer is a huge bonus for ears and neck.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun 5 series shaver after getting sick of using manual razors. Two of my uncles, in their mid to late 40s both use Braun shavers and really like them. One has a Series 3 and the other a Series 7, or 360.  I&#x27;m 18, but I&#x27;ve been shaving for a couple years now and really like this Braun shaver. The charging/ cleaning base is nicely designed, if a bit plastick-y. It uses the same cable to charge the razor and the docking station, which is nice unless you need to unplug the shaver to travel. I like the trimmer on the back, and its sliding function. I get a nice close shave on my chin and sides of my face, but my sideburns are difficult to completely shave off without the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. I have to use a fair amount of pressure, which isn&#x27;t the best thing for the foil. The shaver has a somewhat difficult time getting all of the hair on my neck, as it all doesn&#x27;t grow in the same direction. Directly around my Adam&#x27;s apple is another place this shaver struggles. However, it was a good deal ($100 at Fred Meyer&#x27;s) and does a good job. I just wish that Braun would have picked a slightly more open foil design.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Ordered for my son and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS ELECTRIC SHAVERS BRAUN,  NORELCO,  ETC.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BEST SHAVE I EVER HAD.  PLENTY OF BATTERY LIFE TOO.  I DO MOST OF MY SHAVING IN MY CAR ON THE WAY TO WORK OR MEETINGS.  IT FEELS LIKE I SHAVED WITH A STRAIGHT RAZOR.  I STILL SHAVE WITH A RAZOR ONCE A WEEK TO TAKE OFF SOME PEACH FUZZ AROUND MY NECK LINE.  IT HAS 3 HEAD SETTINGS THAT ALLOW THE HEAD TO MOVE OR STAY STATIONERY SO YOU CAN PICK THE SETTING BEST FOR YOU.  I USE THE 3RD SETTING WHICH ALLOWS THE HEAD TO MOVE FREELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE DRAW BACK IS THAT THE CHARGING HOLDER HAS AN ALCOHOL INSERT ON THE BOTTOM THAT CLEANS THE HEAD AND LASTS FOR A MONTH OR SO.  THEY DONT TELL YOU WHERE TO ORDER THE REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGE.  IT ALSO SMELLS ANTISEPTIC BUT DOES CLEAN THE HEAD.  THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH CLEANING AT THE STATION IS IT TAKES 4 HOURS TO DRY SO YOU HAVE TO PLAN THE CLEANING AFTER YOU SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL IN ALL THE BEST SHAVE I EVER GOT AND A BARGAIN AT ABOUT  $150 WITH FREE DELIVERY.&lt;br /&gt;THE CHARGING STATION ALSO ILLUMINATES A LIGHT BLUE COLOR ON THE BOTTOM AND GIVES A NICE STAR WARS EFFECT.</li>
    <li> So I hate shaving, I would always end up with irritation.  So I decided on trying an electric, first was the Philips Norelco 730. The 730 chewed up my face causing a lot of irritation especially on my neck and the shave was not that close, I shaved at 8:00am and by 2:00pm it was rough like sand paper so I returned it.  I did some research and decided on the 760 Braun, but we were in Costco and they had this model for $100 so I bought the 550.  My review of this model is the closeness is superior to the rotary razor, I can shave and 12 hrs later still smooth.  This razor does not cause any irritation to my face or neck, it is also much faster to shave with than a rotary.  The cleaning system is great comes out clean and smelling like lemons.  This razor is perfect for my needs, sold on the made in Germany Braun. It&#x27;s so good I want to thank the engineers who designed it, no more irritation and clean smooth shave. Would absolutely recommend</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and fast shave with this system.  Very satisfied with the selection.  The system has an easy clening mechanism and the shave is smooth.</li>
    <li> excellent saver. Not as close as a razor shave but great for basic usage. refills of cleaner cost about $20 a year for me.</li>
    <li> simply amazing! i had been using the Philips Norelco before. never again will i use or buy rotary shavers again. honestly I can&#x27;t remember the model that I had, but it was in the upper mid range similar to this one if comparing features, price range and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i waited a few months before writing a review about this as i really wanted to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the best electric shaver ive owned. it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, gets a close shave (for being electronic) charges quickly, easy to use and the automated cleaning system really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in fact the automated cleaning system that cleans, disincects and lubricates the cutting mechanisms does a fantastic and efficient job. it is definitely one of my favorite features and the refills are cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall this is a great product and well worth the small investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also love that fact that the cutting mechanism is slightly longer lasting when compared to the Philips Norelco series. that lowers the over all cost in the long run (not including the cartridge refills)</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the Braun 5 550cc because it gives a close shave better than a rotary and superior to any flat head razor I have used. The best shave is still with the blade and cream. I have not used the cleaning feature yet. the charge lasted for three shaves over a weeks time which I thought should have been longer but plugging in brought it up to speed.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on sale for $50. The price was right, $100 below the usual price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was not acceptable. The battery and charging system did not work properly. I requested a replacement and the same problem with the battery charging system came along with the replacement. Basically, the batteries would not charge properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always think that Braun products are just great. This one was a dud - two times. I finally returned the Braun shaver for a refund. Was this a case of selling a defective batch of shavers at a discount...hoping for the best? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it . It&#x27;s his new man toy.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this razor! He actually WANTS to shave in the morning! He said it feels like a massage every time he uses it. This is a great choice for men who are prone to razor burn. It really is fabulous.</li>
    <li> My Husband says this is the best shaver he has ever owned and he is 80.  That is tremendous praise for an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;He has had them all so he is a good tester.&lt;br /&gt;He says it gives a quick, close shave without tearing up your face.&lt;br /&gt;A ++ to Braun!</li>
    <li> i can not tell you how much i wanted these but love these</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as a Christmas gift for my husband, and he loves it.  It is his second Braun.  He previously had a Series 3.</li>
    <li> This very good product and has a self cleaning system with this razor. Just love it and works well. Wad a fantastic buy!</li>
    <li> The shaver is made nice and sturdy. I like the idea that it comes with its own shaving solution. The shave was nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I previously had a top of the line Braun razor for about 10 years, it was one of the first to have the shave system/cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;When it died last year and I found it would cost more to repair it than buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I suffered with a cheap $50 Braun Series 1 for about twelve months.  When I found this model for $120 I decided&lt;br /&gt;to take a chance and step down from my old 7 series to the 5 series.  Wow, after six weeks I really like&lt;br /&gt;this model.  I think it shaves better than my old 7 series.  It&#x27;s easy to get a quick close shave and the&lt;br /&gt;trimmer extends out further making hair trimming easier.  I only use the cleaner system every 2-3 days and&lt;br /&gt;have found the cleaning solution stays clean for about sixty days which reduces the cost of buying new ones.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this 5 series and doubt I would spend the additional money for a 7 series.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun electric for many years and I&#x27;m 71. The series 5 is by far the worst razor they have made, to the fact that I have gone back to my Braun 8985 that is probably 5 yrs old and has old cutters on it. I get better shaves with the old Braun then the series 5. I don&#x27;t know what they changed in it but maybe they lowered the motor size and speed. The razor does not give a close shave unless you go over and over the same spots. It sometimes pulls at the beard at tender spots. I have called Braun and they sent me a new cutter and still no change. If you must buy a Braun buy an older model.</li>
    <li> My fiance loves this. It was a Xmas gift &amp; he&#x27;s very happy with it. This replaced an old Braun he had for almost 10yrs.</li>
    <li> All of the reviews pointed to this model, ahead of even the &amp;#34;higher&amp;#34; Braun Series.  I did not compare myself, but it does work better than the 20 year old Braun that it replaced.  I like my model, but when I saw another series 5 at Costco (without the charging/cleaning base for $99 I bought another one for my Dad to replace his 20 year old Braun shaver, and he likes it too.</li>
    <li> Very impressed - great shave, and I like the fact that it monitors and keeps itself charged without me having to force the charging cycle.  Also great that it will charge without cleaning.  I can hit the button to run the clean cycle when I want, rather than every time it charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great shaver - far better than the Series 3 I had before!</li>
    <li> My son attends the Citadel Military University and was home for Christmas break for nearly one month, of which he did not shave!  He just told me his face feels the best its ever felt!  The Braun Series 5 has provided him with the ease of hassle-free shaving along with eliminating the drawbacks of using a manual razor.  Huge thanks to Braun for a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I used an electric razor once ten years ago and it felt as if it was pulling my hair instead of cutting it. well I decided to try electrics again. the Braun was amazing. not once did it hurt or feel uncomfortable. the Braun series 5 left my skin feeling smooth. the only problem I have is that is has 3 led&#x27;s to display battery level. the bottom one or the \\&quot;low\\&quot; indicator didn&#x27;t work. but that&#x27;s what they have warranty&#x27;s for.</li>
    <li> I was a good gift .&lt;br /&gt;My honey love it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;After use this brand, he doesn&#x27;t want to try another brand.</li>
    <li> very much like the product - very close shave and very easy to clean . good value and would recommend this product</li>
    <li> طلبتها لواحد من الشباب وللأسف استعجل فيها وماتستاهل قيمتها نهائيا بدون مبالغة مكينة بـ 50 دولار تعطيك خيارات اكثر ويمكن حلاقة افضل</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he says it&#x27;s the best electronic shaver that he has had, and he has had a lot over our 22+ years of marriage.  I also bought the suggested cleaner with this, and I&#x27;m glad I did because he is using that too which he didn&#x27;t tank he would. Perfect shaver and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Out of the box these are great razors, auto cleaning and a smooth shave. However the moment the warranty wears out, so does the razor. The foil will let you know when it needs to be replaced, how? because it will come loses, cutting your face. The auto cleaning terminals will let you know it is old, because it wont work without being held down in the cradle. The battery will tell you its old, because it wont hold a charge, and it wont allow you to use the A/C cord to shave either.    Oh, yes and in addition to being vastly more expensive compared to other razors, the replacement parts are more expensive too, and if you have a problem, the company will charge you to ship it to them, and charge you to \\&quot;see if it is under warranty.\\&quot;    These are poor quality razors, and too expensive spend additional 75 dollars a year in replacement parts. Go with a cheaper razor with a better company that stand behind its products.</li>
    <li> I think I like it, I like clean barrels of it, I like the rubber material, it&#x27;s very clean shaven.</li>
    <li> Great shaver...State of art technology &amp; the price was unreal...Lower than all box stores incl  Walmart &amp; Best Buy &amp; Target &amp; to top off shipped to my doorstep in 1 day for free..If I didn&#x27;t experience it I would not believe it  but it did.Works great &amp; cannot say more.If your in the market for a quality electric shaver this is one &amp; Amazon should be your source.</li>
    <li> One of the best shavers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Takes used to how it chagers, but easy to clean and maintain</li>
    <li> Meh -- Nothing is as close as a razor but at least now I can burn over my moles without fear of cutting them off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several shavers in the past 10 years and this by far exceeds the performance of the others, which were admittedly less costly.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and really like it. My only complaint it that when I shave 3-4 days&#x27; growth (don&#x27;t like shaving on my days off) it leaves some of the longer hairs intact.  Not a major drawback by any means.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift. Other people say it works better than. The even the 760 and it doesn&#x27;t have some of the extra unnecessary bells and whistles. This was a great gift. My friend loves it. I would buy one for myself, but I love my manly beard.</li>
    <li> This was the third shaver that I have purchased in the past year as a gift.  My brother loves this so far. It&#x27;s easy to use, clean and store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because this razor doesn&#x27;t shave my neck as close as my old Remington. Not by a long shot.  I do like that it&#x27;s quiet and I like the cleaning system it comes with, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this razor to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time in the mornings to shave. It&#x27;s simply not a close shave for such an expensive razor.</li>
    <li> Great design and build quality. Gives me a close shave. Much better than 3 series. Im a huge fan of Braun now.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave cleanly under chin and under jaws (as advertised) - tried all the recommendations - too much money for a poor shave</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun 15 years ago and loved it except for the tedious routine of cleaning the blades and brushing the foil.  I ruined two heads when the bristles snagged the foil.  My co-workers felt this self-cleaning cradle was frivolous but I strongly disagree.  Shaving isn&#x27;t a chore anymore and the self-cleaning function is fun to watch.  No more standing, safety blades, lathered soap, nicks and styptic pencils.  I sit on the couch watching the History Channel and during commercials do a leisureIy shave and drop the razer in the cradle.  It&#x27;s idiot proof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this package to everyone.  It&#x27;s truly fun to use and worth every penny.  Be sure to order at least two 4-packs of the cleaning solution and an extra cutter/foil pack.  Shipping is free so stock up and make your life easy.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun series 3 for ten years before buying this one.  It was the best I ever had. t cuts close, smooth and fast and is easy to maintain.  I bought the series 5 model after my old one finally gave up after I dropped it.  The new one work just as good.  Its well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My first ever product review here.  So I am really unhappy with this product from Braun, Not Amazon at all.  I was trading what I thought would be up after many happy years of series 3 ownership.  Not the case at all:  Cleaning and charging on this are not available as an option together as in my series 3.  I could select clean only, charge only or clean and charge.  On my new not improved Series fail, after 2 months of use cannot for the life of me get the thing to clean and charge.  Just clean and plug in outside of the cleaner to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave take forever, 12 + minutes and I do not have a tough beard.  I have to go over and over my face a dozen plus times.  Another peeve is the power button is where one would naturally place the a thumb one held.  Lo &amp; behold in the mid shave while moving across my face I turn the thing off!  Irritating!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Braun!!  Wake up and test these things!!  Please??</li>
    <li> Plain and simply, this shaver surpassed my expectations. I don&#x27;t get excited too easily and this one made me giddy. I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m still excited about using it.  If all you&#x27;ve ever used is cheap under $40 shavers that you can get from the local drug store, splurge and purchase this shaver. You&#x27;ll be happy with your decision.</li>
    <li> Great product I only buy Braun. The cleaning button could work a little better but great for the price</li>
    <li> Pros: works great on sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t pull at my hair. Cleaning system works pretty well. The aesthetics are nice with black and silver trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t shave along my neck line. at. all. Have to use my regular razor blade to get my neck. You think for $100+ it wouldn&#x27;t have a problem.  Takes a good 20 minutes to shave if you have 4 days of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver. Still giving it a go, and will be sure to shave again before my stubble gets too long. How I&#x27;ve been doing. May upgrade to the 7 series due to their larger openings on the shaver pores.</li>
    <li> I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas, unfortunately i made the order a little too late, the package was suppose to arrive on December 27th, but i was pleasantly surprised to see it on the porch on December 24th. I already told him that hes present was going to arrive late, so i was able to surprise him on Christmas too. Thanks! and as far as the product works, it works amazing! Always leaves him super soft time after time in just minutes.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed my Braun Series 5 550cc shaver system. It is my first electric shaver and I am very impressed. It gives a very close shave and is a great product. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> great father&#x27;s day gift</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and as expected. It was a gift, so it wasn&#x27;t opened for several days. He says it works great and is an improvement on the Series 3 Braun that he has.</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun Series 5 550cc that got worn out - I needed a replacement and this works out great</li>
    <li> After two Panasonic razors, which gave good shaves, but did not last as long as I&#x27;d like, I went back to Braun and am very happy with my Series 5. I think it shaves closer than the recent Panasonic and is very comfortable to use. My neck area is better shaved and has no irritation. Time-wise I believe it may be faster than the Panasonic since it shaves closer the first pass and therefore requires fewer passes to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that I would miss the wet-shave aspect of the Panasonic, but I felt that I did that so infrequently lately that I could get by without it. I was right. The Series 5 gets close with comfort and I do not feel the need for the wet-shave feature. I was also skeptical about the cleaning station and its recurring costs for refills. But I like the really clean razor feel and the solution lasts long enough that cost is not a bad trade-off for the additional cleaning function.&lt;br /&gt;The cord can be used to charge the razor directly, without the station, and that makes extended travel more convenient. Overall, I&#x27;d buy it again - to give an indication of how pleased I am at this point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product because my face skin is much more better. The shipment speed was very good. It takes less than 48 hours to get this product.</li>
    <li> I like it but not as close as a razor. Although I use it more than a razor.</li>
    <li> SO FAR SO GOOD.  THE SHAVE IS EVEN CLOSER THAN MY 10 YEAR OLD BRAUN GAVE.</li>
    <li> This charges and cleans at the same time and gives a good clean shave.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an older Braun, which I have had for years. Perfect comfortable shave every time. Wish I had replaced the old one sooner.</li>
    <li> This device is working great. I got it to replace an older model where the side burn cutter broke. The contour shaving works better than any other electric shaver I have owned to date. The fact that you can wash it clean and use your own solution mixture to clean it is a bonus.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun shaver in the last 36 years. The last two were great and lasted quite a while, this new Series 5 550 is the best shaver yet.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 5 550cc shaver is the best electric shaver I have ever had. Braun is known for thoughtful designs. This shaver gives me the opportunity to easily keep the razor clean and sharp.</li>
    <li> Such a nice close shave.  Easy to maneuver in rough areas.  Love the cleanse and moisturize system.  Purchased this razor as a just because gift for my father.  I kid you not, he shaved 4 times in one day.  HE LOVES IT, your man will love you if you get this for him too !</li>
    <li> Very good razor my husband says.  My only problem with it is that you have to buy the containers for cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pain and expensive to use.</li>
    <li> Design and the self-cleaning function both superb. Closeness of shave is just slightly above average....not the best I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
    <li> Better than the old Braun I had but disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t give a closer shave.  The auto cleaning is great but the cleaning fluid required is way too expensive!</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 5 did not disappoint, it works great on your skin and lets you have a smooth look in the morning. The thing I liked the most about this is its cleaning system, you just press a button and it cleans itself up.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery...works well.  Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I had a braun before and it is just as good as old one,can&#x27;t go wrong with a braun,thats&#x27;why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Bought the Braun Series 5 550cc Shaver System for Fathers Day.  He is very pleased.  Good product.</li>
    <li> These last over 10 years, nothing compares ! *UPDATE* After using this product I would rather have my old Braun 7526 shaver over this one hands down!</li>
    <li> works well my grandfather loved it. the shaver itself is rlly nice the only complaint i have is that the little dock or w/e its on is plastic so thats annoying i wish that was higher quality for what i payed but nonetheless its about the shaver right? the dock does clean it so it does its job.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th Braun shaver over 25 years.  I usually get a new on when the batteries are no longer useful.  Every time I am impressed with a better shave.  This 550c was no exception.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 18 months with no degradation in shave quality.  You really don&#x27;t need to change the foil and cutter every 18 month.  I usually to 24-30 months.  I have a heavy beard and it cuts right through even if I skip a day.  For me, I get a better shave after taking a shower rather than before.  But as I said, I have a heavy beard.  If you are coming from a blade, give it a couple weeks and learn how to shave with an electric razor.  It&#x27;s not a one pass operation.  Lastly, I&#x27;ll add that you don&#x27;t need to keep buying the cleaning solution.  Just clean it out with a little compressed air once a week or so and your are good to go.</li>
    <li> Love this. Works great. Quiet. Looks good. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Got it in early and it works like a champ. Now my mornings are so much easier with this bad boy</li>
    <li> Husband is very happy with the shaver.  It arrived earlier than expected which was an added plus.  It was much cheaper buying this product online rather than in a retail store.  We both were very pleased.</li>
    <li> Just bought a panasonic to replace my old braun (10 years old) a few weeks prior to buying this Braun Series 5. Turns out the panasonics was not what I had expected, could not shave while powering up, and the charge would take nearly a full night for a few minutes of shaving. Unfortunately I was on business in the State when I discover how bad the panasonics was.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to bite the bullet and get a new shaver. Since I had a braun in the past I felt it was a safe choice. The charge is great and last nearly 2 to 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The auto cleaner bit is in the bin. Not interested in it. I feel it is more of a gimmick and not really any added benefit.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does the job I need for a decent price and hopefully will last as long as the previous one!</li>
    <li> This product is great shaves great and best of all it has a self cleaning base only gave it 4 stars because sometimes It may leave some hair it&#x27;s a great product but of corse if you want a perfect shave u have to use a straight razor overall I love ittt</li>
    <li> Shaving was great, but the trimmer was not up tp snuff.. Had a tendency to pull.For trimming would sugest purchase norelco inexpensive trimmer set for $22.00</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun and it is a huge disappointment.  Poor shave quality.  No matter how many passes you make across the face and no matter the speed at which you move the shaver, it still leaves a lot of stubble</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun for many years, works great. When it came time to buy one for my son there was no other choice.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is really great.  It gets a really smooth shave.  If you were the type of person who is clean shaven every day, this is wonderful!  I typically go a few days between shaves, so I use clippers to get the hairs short then use this to get the clean shave.  Only down side is that the base takes up a lot of space.  I have to keep the razor plugged in in the bedroom because I don&#x27;t have counter space in the bathroom for this.  4.5 stars is what I would rate it.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much everything I was looking for in a foil shaver, including the sheer practicality. Push a button to turn it on, set it on the stand to charge, rinse it out with water after a shave. Simple. No extra &amp;#34;shaving profiles&amp;#34; or extra bits that don&#x27;t really improve the shave itself. That said, the charging and cleaning stand is somewhat superfluous in my opinion since the shaver is so easy to clean at the sink, but I guess it&#x27;s also pretty simple to use and the purported lubrication is good for the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, it&#x27;s definitely an improvement over the older Braun it replaced. I can&#x27;t say for sure if it&#x27;s the foil pattern or the &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; middle cutter, or if it&#x27;s just that new, but most of the hair comes off in a pass or two and I like the feel. I also like the stainless steel trimmer head on the back, which looks pretty sturdy. My last one, which was made mostly out of plastic, had begun to vibrate and make extra noise. I&#x27;ve also had the opportunity to take it with me on a week long trip and the battery held up just fine.</li>
    <li> I had ingrown hair issues on my neck which this shaver solved. I have had these issues for years with lots of different shaving methods so this made me very happy. Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor but this is likely helping with the ingrown issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given more stars but it is still difficult to get some hairs that lay down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise feels of good quality and have had no issues with it!</li>
    <li> My son and I both have one of these.  Best electric shave I have had to date.  I have had this brand before and they seem to last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a solid product. Its my first adventure into the &amp;#34;higher&amp;#34; end electric shavers. The cleaning portion is very effective and definitely gets the razor clean. It is a bit noisy, but that&#x27;s a nit pick of a complaint. I have a beard and I shave daily to keep the shape I want. I generally use the electric to get 90% of it and then a razor to really clean up the work. With this Braun I have MUCH less cleanup than I had in the past with my very entry level Remmington shaver. For the money, I hope it will last many years and continue to be effective.</li>
    <li> My husband bought many different electric shavers when he switched from razors.  Then he bought a Braun and never had to buy another shaver for over 10 years.  The new one is not replacing the older one, its being used in a second location.  It gives him a great shave and easy to charge and keep clean in the included base. And since I started getting the cleaning solution and replacement heads from Amazon I think I save money versus razors, and no bloody knicks.</li>
    <li> Works great and love the cleaning feature.</li>
    <li> feels great and shaves close. the size is good and small. charges quick and cleans easy. They have made good improvements on the shaver from the beginning</li>
    <li> Great electric shaver!!  I&#x27;m fully satisfied--wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.  I don&#x27;t even use the base or the cleaning fluid---I use it in the shower to shave my head and just wash it off in there.</li>
    <li> Love it and loved the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, easy usage and easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> Great gift for hubby!!!</li>
    <li> Great shipping and my husband loves it</li>
    <li> This item has been purchased as a Christmas gift and has not yet been used.  I cannot comment on how it  has performed.  However, I expect it to be of good quality and completely satisfactory per the pervious reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carole</li>
    <li> It is the best shave that I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomic design makes it the easiest shave as well.</li>
    <li> Husband love it, says it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave any better than others that I&#x27;ve had.  Can&#x27;t get to soft wiskers.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a very clean shave.  Maybe, I expected too much as I have been shaving with cream and a blade for many years.</li>
    <li> On time and as advertised</li>
    <li> For over 30 years my husband has only ever used a Noreclo or Remington rotary razor. A major decade birthday came and went and just like that everything has been flipped on its head. Serously. This IPA guy is suddenly asking for dark lagers. And yes, we&#x27;ve test rode some sports cars. So, it shouldn&#x27;t have surprised me when he choose to use a Christmas Amazon gift card to replace his old razor with this Braun. And boy, am I glad he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now his sweet little checks are soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. No kidding. Yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said he had no problem switching razor types. His beard has a slight curl. He said this razor works very well. Holds a charge for longer than any other razor he owns. Razor easily stores in charging/cleaning unit. Also comes with a simple cord charger and case for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would both recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Do not buy.  It&#x27;s not returnable and my husband says it feels like a tractor on your face.  My first review ever since it&#x27;s my only way to save someone else a great loss of money.  My husband has been very happy with Braun in the past but not this time.</li>
    <li> The price was good, considering I found it listed at other stores for as much as $199. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, but I have no complaints. I shave everyday with it and I like the cleaning feature.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised</li>
    <li> I needed to replace a worn out razor. This is a very nice replacement and use it daily. It arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I use my Braun razor every day for about six months now.  It gets a really close shave if you spend enough time 5-10 min, which is somewhat normal for electric razors in my experience.  When I&#x27;m done i put in the charger stand and press the clean button, which gets most of the hairs out.  Mind you the refills are around 5$ each and will last you 2-3 months.  It has been a good purchase for me and I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, the inner cutting bar seemed to really resolve the problem of curled or flat-laying whiskers.  Other electric shavers cut the easy, straight whiskers and left the others growing long.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning solution sounded like a gimmick, but I was surprised that I actually liked it.  It left the razor clean as new.</li>
    <li> very sharp smooth shave, and easy to clean. would recommend, to anyone, that has sensitive skin. my last braun is 12 years old still works, but this one is 10 times better! jerry, knoxville,tn</li>
    <li> I had been a long time norelco user, when I bought this braun, because the replacement head for the norelco cost as much as the sale price of this braun.  I got this instead and have been glad I did.  The braun provides a much much closer shave and I like the cleaning charging feature.</li>
    <li> My husband gets a much closer shave than with his previous shaver. It seems to be very easy to clean manually also, which is good because he doesn&#x27;t like using the cleaning system. And the fact that it operates as a cord or cordless unit is just what he was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 390cc for a couple years now. I liked it a lot. But, I ended up dropping it one too many times and it broke. (It held up very well with many drops though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i decided to get another. But figured i&#x27;d trade up a model and am i sure glad i did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 550cc works so much better than the 390cc... The difference is night and day. I had no idea what i was missing.. It cuts more hair on one pass, gets a closer shave and has cut my shaving time down. It works especially well on the neck area, not painful at all like a traditional razor &amp; cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean and Renew system works very well. I only use mine 2-3 times a week. (you can easily use the razor a couple times before it needs cleaned/charged and you can rinse out the foil head under the faucet in between using the clean and renew system) I Keep the unit unplugged when not in-use and put that little plastic cap back on the cleaning solution and it makes the solution last a lot longer and doesn&#x27;t allow it to evaporate. Those refill cartridges aren&#x27;t cheap. But they&#x27;re well worth it. It makes the shaver like new. It smells nice and fresh like lemon and lubricates it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get some irritation on my face on the first couple days of use. Which was unexpected since i had been using a braun foil shaver for quite some time. But i&#x27;m pretty sure there is a warning on the shaver about that. But it only lasted a couple days and all is well now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that. There are no downsides to this shaver. I dont know what else i could ask for really. A fast, close and comfortable shave everyday is pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I love the fact that it has a self cleaner...Been only using it for about a week...loving it</li>
    <li> I had an older model that finally gave out after five years or so.  The old one had some kind of arm that came over the top to plug in for charging etc.  That is gone and I&#x27;m glad.  There are now a few contact points on the top/back of the razor that fix nicely into the washing stand.  Others were complaining about thick beards not shaving well.  I have had no issues so I don&#x27;t know if theirs might have been too long but I have tick facial hair and have no issues shaving daily or even three to four days later.  I&#x27;ve also noticed better shaving on my neck area.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I like the actual shaving device. I was able to get a, consistent, clean and quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, the base charger has broken twice! I bought the shaver system last June and everything worked fine. I was relocated in September and once I got to my new residence the base would no longer charge or clean the shaving device. So, although I packed it carefully, I assumed something must have broken the base charger during the moving period and went to buy an additional unit. Unfortunately, after a couple months, the base charger broke AGAIN; this leads me to believe something is faulty with the charging dock, thus making this product only 50% useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got 2 lemons, but after 2 mishaps, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great razor, I especially like the power options with this design being able to go cordless, plugged in to wall, or charged in the cleaning device. The cleaning fluid last a lot longer than previous models.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week straight now (7 days of shaving). What can I say, it is great. Everything arrived packaged very nicely. The cleaning station is simple enough to get set up. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 14 years using some form of manual razor, with a dabble of cheaper electric brands for going to the field. I have to say that this thing shaves just as close as shaving against the grain with a 3-5 blade manual razor. I am very impressed with the quality of shave. Not to mention, it is super convenient. It glides across my face. Every other electric razor I&#x27;ve tried seems like complete garbage compared to this thing. I had a hard time choosing between this and the 3 series, but I think I made the right choice. Here are my only two &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- The pivoting head doesn&#x27;t really pivot too much while I use it. I have the adjuster set to the &amp;#34;free pivot&amp;#34; notch, and it does pivot in my fingers, but not a whole lot on my face. Granted, this has not had any effect whatsoever on the comfort or quality of the shave just an interesting note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- The cleaning station didn&#x27;t want to clean one time when I pressed the button. I simply unplugged it and plugged it back in and it was good to go and no problems since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final note - I remember reading something about the cleaning station not letting you charge without cleaning (don&#x27;t remember if it was a 3 or 5 series review), this station does allow the razor to be charged without committing to the cleaning process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shaver now for about a month, but it beats any of the Braun shavers I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
    <li> I had so much trouble getting a replacement cord, that I bought this when I got two wrong cords and Braun kept saying they sent the right cord.</li>
    <li> Will never buy anything except for Braun.</li>
