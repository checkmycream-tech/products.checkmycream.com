      <li>I have bought this product many times.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several acne products, which did not work, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to work because my acne was more hormonal (nearly perfect skin while on birth control pills, a disaster when not).</li>
      <li>I love having something that works so well and no fillers.  </li>
      <li>Extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>This product made my son&#x27;s face breakout more.</li>
      <li>I do love this product and it does work but a word of caution it takes time before you can start seeing results (took me 2 weeks of nightly application).</li>
      <li>exactly as described!!!</li>
      <li>Definaly replace your face lotion with this, worth the price!!</li>
      <li>and my nails are so strong now .</li>
      <li>Cheap compared to Benzyclin that you purchase at the pharmacy with a prescription.  </li>
      <li>This product has greatly improved my son&#x27;s skin in just a very short period of time.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent treatment for acne prone skin without being harsh.</li>
      <li>I use it myself in the morning under my facial cream and am happy with the result.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this product of such good quality and</li>
      <li>Also, the scent is actually more pleasant than other serums she has tried.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Feels like a clean natural oil, and does interact with the skin well, nice to apply to face after a shower - moisturizes while fighting against breakouts - will be buying again.</li>
      <li>The good news is the effect seems to be lasting.  </li>
      <li>I started to use Pura d&#x27; or and I honestly can say it match completely my expectations .</li>
      <li>Seriously, the best!</li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend this product to anybody who is looking for an organic, chemical free way to treat acne.</li>
      <li>def worth the price.</li>
      <li>so far, I&#x27;m really satisfied on this product and keep using it.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I just try to keep my hands off my face, the sting is worth it however, and your results will vary.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This works pretty well.</li>
      <li>greasy, exactly everything that I hoped for.</li>
      <li>I noticed within the first couple of days, my oilly forehead was under control.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost out and ready to order another one!</li>
      <li>is the first time I have tried an oil based product to TREAT my acne, and I feel like with continued use my skin will be more resilient from future breakouts -</li>
      <li>You  feel a warming sensation when you first apply it, but it decreases over continuous use.</li>
      <li>This solution helps her face to clear up most of the acne issues, and also clear up the scars too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that this will erase my acne scars and make my face completely acne free so that I don&#x27;t have to pay as much as I did with Proactiv+, but I&#x27;m going to give it a month and see what it does.</li>
      <li>I bought this because of the effects that I noticed on my face after using the pure argan oil that Pura d&#x27;or sells, so I figured I should try this.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>I tried a lot of acne products on the market but none seem to work as fast as Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>My face has become much smoother&lt;</li>
      <li>Worked very well for my daughter and her acne problem.  </li>
      <li>So far, the only thing that has worked better than this is Proactiv+.</li>
      <li>have only tried the argan on my face, im excited what it has to offer for the skin around my body and my hair.</li>
      <li>Originally I bought it for my teenage boys to help with their acne without drying out the skin.  </li>
      <li>After purchasing  and applying Pura d&#x27;or, argon oil after cleansing daily, I&#x27;ve begun to see significant changes in my face:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>I love this product, not only because it actually works, but also its organic.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product based on the reviews, and thought that maybe something organic and not packed full of harsh chemicals might be worth trying.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s way back right now.</li>
      <li>I thought trying something organic without all the harsh chemicals would work and so far it has cleared up better than any lotion or creams.</li>
      <li>After a couple weeks, my skin was mostly just healing, and after about a month I have very few new blemishes come up, and they go away within a couple days anyway.</li>
      <li>This, and the hair loss shampoo, seemed to do exactly the opposite of what they claim to do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m expecting them to completely gone in this month!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still a decent moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t really affect breakouts for better or worse.</li>
      <li>With regular use, this product has cleared all irritation and redness from his skin in just over 2 weeks, the acne is most definitely less pronounced and the skin is clearer.</li>
      <li>it says on the bottle to use three drops, but you really only need one because it is just pure oil.</li>
      <li>Her moderate acne started to clear in certain areas within 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>It helps clear their skin and counterbalance the dryness that dermatological products cause.  </li>
      <li>I do have an extremely sensitive sense of smell, so thankfully I don&#x27;t smell it throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I apply once in the evening and notice my face feels so soft and supple in the morning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sorry, I can&#x27;t find anything good to say about acne-- accept people look at your face closer.  </li>
      <li>After a solid 2 weeks of use of this Pura d&#x27;or Solution - twice a day (morning and night) using a full squeezed dropper suction amount per use for my entire face and back of neck.</li>
      <li>Right now, I&#x27;m going to give it 4 stars because I just started using it a week ago and other reviews have said to wait about 2 weeks for results.</li>
      <li>The medication offered by our GP had some very serious side effects, so i looked for a more natural alternative.</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll go back to using the pure argan oil by the same brand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Another good news is that this bottle is small but it appears a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>It is the only thing that works for my pigmentation so far.</li>
      <li>It is too early to tell if it works on acne, but I would see later if it does.</li>
      <li>I am a 21 year old female living from NYC.</li>
      <li>I thought maybe it&#x27;s one of those things where it gets worse before it gets better, so I kept using it for another week but no subsiding of the breakouts.</li>
      <li>But made my face more worse.</li>
      <li>After a few days, my scars seemed to reduce very clearly and in a month, they were very blur.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any major breakouts since starting it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product!! It really works.</li>
    <li> Wish this product actually worked on me. But made my face more worse.</li>
    <li> Product arriving timely without any issues.  This is an excellent treatment for acne prone skin without being harsh.</li>
    <li> The instructions that come with the argan oil said to give this product a try for at least 2 weeks to see results.  I broke out immediately but continued use for 3 weeks because I wanted to believe this product was flushing the bacteria and oil from my skin. The breakouts never stopped.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product along with the Vitamin C serum from this company. Her moderate acne started to clear in certain areas within 2 weeks. You  feel a warming sensation when you first apply it, but it decreases over continuous use. She applies this twice daily and appreciates that it&#x27;s in dropper form, rather than in a pump.Also, the scent is actually more pleasant than other serums she has tried.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, aside from a few of my pimples, I haven&#x27;t seen that this product works all that well, accept for one thing.  It makes my face feel well moisturized, and I love the scent.  For that reason I will continue to use it, but I am using it along with my trusted pharmaceutical grade tea tree oil, since it works much better on my acne.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time.I only been using the oil for three days and already can see noticeable results. I tried a lot of acne products on the market but none seem to work as fast as Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s. Extremely satisfied with my purchase. Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Definitely helping with the acne! Love it!</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts to things differently, so sometimes you just have to try things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a decent moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t really affect breakouts for better or worse. Next time I&#x27;ll go back to using the pure argan oil by the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck. Some people swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my teenage son who has very bad acne. We tried the over the counter lotions and potions and found them to be virtually useless, except for irritating his skin. The medication offered by our GP had some very serious side effects, so i looked for a more natural alternative. This product has greatly improved my son&#x27;s skin in just a very short period of time. With regular use, this product has cleared all irritation and redness from his skin in just over 2 weeks, the acne is most definitely less pronounced and the skin is clearer. I would certainly recommend this product to anybody who is looking for an organic, chemical free way to treat acne.</li>
    <li> I have tried several acne products, which did not work, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to work because my acne was more hormonal (nearly perfect skin while on birth control pills, a disaster when not). I purchased this product based on the reviews, and thought that maybe something organic and not packed full of harsh chemicals might be worth trying. I started to notice a difference after just a few days - fewer new blemishes. After a couple weeks, my skin was mostly just healing, and after about a month I have very few new blemishes come up, and they go away within a couple days anyway. It&#x27;s amazing. Definitely worth the money. I will continue to buy this, and won&#x27;t go back to harsh acne treatments.</li>
    <li> Works great for acne prone skin. I apply once in the evening and notice my face feels so soft and supple in the morning. It is definitely a part of my must haves! I have been using it for about a week and have already noticed a big difference.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Works like magic. I had many acne breakouts and this helped control it. I would use before bedtime.</li>
    <li> I’ve had acne since I was 12, I’m now 30. I gave up on treatments because my body adjust to everything I tried over the years 2 weeks after exposure and the acne has always prevailed.  After a solid 2 weeks of use of this Pura d&#x27;or Solution - twice a day (morning and night) using a full squeezed dropper suction amount per use for my entire face and back of neck. I feel like this is working to revive the skin, working against the break-outs, and does reduce swelling which is what this claims to do.  I feel I am a perfect test for these claims because of the way my skins responds to treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have tried an oil based product to TREAT my acne, and I feel like with continued use my skin will be more resilient from future breakouts - though occasional pimples and zits still pop up I feel like with continued use these will stop.  Needless to say, I think it is working.  Once thing is for sure, I’d rather be walking around with this oil on my face than have my own oils clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons I can think of are not that bad, one being price - slightly highly priced for long term use, and about 6 hours after treatment a little bit of oil creeps its way into my eye, and it stings.. The sting last about 45 seconds and then I get over it, but this is unavoidable I just try to keep my hands off my face, the sting is worth it however, and your results will vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a clean natural oil, and does interact with the skin well, nice to apply to face after a shower - moisturizes while fighting against breakouts - will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This product made my son&#x27;s face breakout more.</li>
    <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> My daughter face used to have very bad acne problem,  and the dermatologist still could not help her. This Pura d&#x27;or Organic Acne Treatment Solution is a miracle solution. This solution helps her face to clear up most of the acne issues, and also clear up the scars too. Amazing solution!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I can&#x27;t find anything good to say about acne-- accept people look at your face closer.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s for the wrong reasons, which is why this Treatment Solution has got to be on the top your \\&quot;get rid of my acne\\&quot; list. This Argan oil is the solution to so many health and beauty issues.  I don&#x27;t know why we don&#x27;t hear about it more.    -Buy it now  -Buy it now  -Buy it now!</li>
    <li> I have bought this product many times.  Originally I bought it for my teenage boys to help with their acne without drying out the skin.  If you have a very serious acne issue it will not clear it.  They have used it at time sin combination with other products.  It helps clear their skin and counterbalance the dryness that dermatological products cause.  I use it myself in the morning under my facial cream and am happy with the result.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy, exactly everything that I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I just got it1-2 weeks back. It dried up my existing acne without drying out my skin. I love the smell of this oil. Its too soon to see the results on fading the acne scars but I am hoping continued use will help lighten the scars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had years of pimples and when I was too stressed . the aen breaks out a lot. I &#x27;ve tried a lot of calrigying acne product but not that effective like LA ROCHE-POSAY. and I accidentally saw this product and decide to buy it. for it is organic and no side effect. It really reduces my acne as I applyed several drops on my acne area at night, u will see the diminishing effect on the other morning. so far, I&#x27;m really satisfied on this product and keep using it.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and my skin looks and feels great!!! I also put it on my hand where I have bad eczema and it started feeling less itchy and dry within 2 days.  So glad I found this product of such good quality and a good price!!</li>
    <li> This product has changed my skin! I am a 21 year old female living from NYC. From my adolescence, my face has always been flaky and dry due to the pollution and dirty city air that i have been exposed to. I also have really bad facial acne, which i tried to maintain by using cleansers and moisturizers continuously. My doctors have also prescribed me acne medication that I&#x27;ve took for a period of time. I could only see slight improvement in my facial condition. After purchasing  and applying Pura d&#x27;or, argon oil after cleansing daily, I&#x27;ve begun to see significant changes in my face:&lt;br /&gt;1) My face has become much smoother&lt;br /&gt;2)I have a glow on my face after i wake up in the morning with argan oil&lt;br /&gt;3) My acne lessened and my acne scars diminished.&lt;br /&gt;I have only tried the argan on my face, im excited what it has to offer for the skin around my body and my hair.</li>
    <li> Works good haven&#x27;t had a bad break out since I started using this product. smells great I&#x27;m just waiting now for it to start clearing up blemishes</li>
    <li> after about a week or two of continuous use, (one-two drops, once a day) I&#x27;ve already noticed that my acne scars are starting to fade! it says on the bottle to use three drops, but you really only need one because it is just pure oil. smells great too (: def worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this bottle mainly because the fragrance of this treatment is very pleasant its almost like aroma therapy.  I do love this product and it does work but a word of caution it takes time before you can start seeing results (took me 2 weeks of nightly application). The good news is the effect seems to be lasting.  Another good news is that this bottle is small but it appears a little goes a long way.  I will be continuing with this &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; instead of using harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> If you are pacient to see results then get, It can take about 2 or 3 months before you definetly start noticing the diference, I put it on my face after I wash it before I go to bed every night. I&#x27;m almost out and ready to order another one!</li>
    <li> I have really bad acne on my forehead and back. Ive tried any and everything from clearasil to proacvit to even birth control pills. I was desperate to find something to clear my skin problem. All of those products have only made my skin issues worse. This product is my saving grace. I noticed within the first couple of days, my oilly forehead was under control. And within a week or so, my forehead started clearing up. I seriously, was amazed! I love this product, not only because it actually works, but also its organic. No more harsh chemicals on my skin. Seriously, the best! I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This works pretty well. Right now, I&#x27;m going to give it 4 stars because I just started using it a week ago and other reviews have said to wait about 2 weeks for results. If it clears up all my acne, I will give it 5 stars. It does have a scent to it, but I got used to it after a couple days. The first couple days I felt slightly nauseous when I smelled it, but after the 3rd, I got used to it. I do have an extremely sensitive sense of smell, so thankfully I don&#x27;t smell it throughout the day. I haven&#x27;t noticed any major breakouts since starting it. There is a cluster of pimples on my forehead that seemed to get more noticeable, but I&#x27;m hoping with time, they will go away. I bought this because of the effects that I noticed on my face after using the pure argan oil that Pura d&#x27;or sells, so I figured I should try this. So far, the only thing that has worked better than this is Proactiv+. I&#x27;m hoping that this will erase my acne scars and make my face completely acne free so that I don&#x27;t have to pay as much as I did with Proactiv+, but I&#x27;m going to give it a month and see what it does.</li>
    <li> I started to use Pura d&#x27; or and I honestly can say it match completely my expectations . My skin is so smoot after application . and my nails are so strong now . It&#x27;s so nice to get hair without dandruff. I will suggest it to my friens.  After 10 days I can say to be completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for months and nothing in the stores seems to help. I thought trying something organic without all the harsh chemicals would work and so far it has cleared up better than any lotion or creams. I will continue the use of this product.</li>
    <li> Whenever I take showers my skin would feel tight and dry afterwards, but after using this just once then working out, all sweaty and stuff, I took a shower and my face did not feel tight and dry at ALL!! Even after using the face lotions out there my skin would still feel dry, but this definatly works on moisterizing your skin. It is too early to tell if it works on acne, but I would see later if it does. Definaly replace your face lotion with this, worth the price!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great! I found it while looking for a chemical-free acne treatment, and I&#x27;ve heard great things about Argan oil! We&#x27;ll see how it works....</li>
    <li> Like Scully of the X-Files, I WANTED TO BELIEVE that this would help me. I heard of this product through a review for ProActive (planted perhaps?) and the five star reviews sold me on it. At first it did seem to be helping, but then it made my face break out worse than it has it ages. I thought maybe it&#x27;s one of those things where it gets worse before it gets better, so I kept using it for another week but no subsiding of the breakouts. This, and the hair loss shampoo, seemed to do exactly the opposite of what they claim to do. That, and I suspect some of the reviews are phony. Something just seems off. Anyway, it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way back right now. If all goes well with the refund maybe I&#x27;ll raise the stars for acceptable customer service. But for me these were a no.</li>
    <li> I love having something that works so well and no fillers.  It moisturizes perfectly, my skin is so much healthier.</li>
    <li> Worked very well for my daughter and her acne problem.  Cheap compared to Benzyclin that you purchase at the pharmacy with a prescription.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It is the only thing that works for my pigmentation so far. After a few days, my scars seemed to reduce very clearly and in a month, they were very blur. I&#x27;m expecting them to completely gone in this month! And one bottle lasts longer than 2 months.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Use it for treatment of acne.  I use it as my face lotion night and morning.  After washing my face I&#x27;ll get a little water on my hands wipe my face use two drops of this product and rub it into my face...love it!</li>
