<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looks like petroleum jelly but does not feel heavy like petroleum jelly.  Helps with the dry spots.  Recommended by my doctor to use on dry spots caused by sun damage.  Some dry spots have even disappeared.  Great product.</li>
    <li> We go through this like water. The big tub is convenient when changing diapers. Lasts much longer than the tubes which can sometimes contain more air and not enough product.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a lotion after each bath and on my hand after washing the dishes, I have been using this product for over 12 years. It was recommended by my daughter pediatrican after my daughter keep having very dry skin. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this and so happy found in this nice large size.  Will for sure buy again when needed and it really does a great job</li>
    <li> This is amazing ointment - I mix it with Vanicream, which I also get through Amazon, and they keep my skin hydrated and happy.  I have had Aquaphor recommended by dermatologists and skin/surgeons/ specialists in face work - it is magical and healing!  I mix them together and put them all over and they really help my skin be happy.  Helps get rid of &amp;#34;alligator skin&amp;#34;.  And itching due to dryness.  But put when using a lot of it - as I do - mixed with the Vanicream - do it in the morning - it works in and you don&#x27;t feel sticky between the sheets at night with all the lotions.</li>
    <li> This is the only ointment that works for my sons dry red winter rashes under the lips. We have tried many others even prescription ones. But none others work.</li>
    <li> I use this nightly with gloves for my hands and also mix it with Retin A for a wonderful night cream!!!!  I go through this by the gallons!!!</li>
    <li> Kind of greasy buy good</li>
    <li> My tattoo artist recommended this to use on my new tattoo. It is very think and will not absorb into your skin, so it was perfect to keep the ink moist and prevent cracking.</li>
    <li> Good product.  My husband has many allergies and this gives him some relief so we are glad to have it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. Because she used to make her fingers and palm damaged every Winter and this item is the only suitable one for care her skin. This exact item is not available to purchase in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon to introduce this item to us.</li>
    <li> The doctor had suggested either Vaseline or Aquaphor for our toddlers eczema. We went with Aquaphor - after all it  cost a lot more. After about 5 tubs of Aquaphor, our childs eczema just kept getting worse. I was not sure if Aquaphor was doing any good or was actually doing harm. An epiphany of sorts came about when we found that night-time itching episodes of the child were much better taken care of when we applied Cetaphil and this really got me poking around.      Later I read on one of the eczema sites that Lanolin (one of the ingredients of Aquaphor) does not go well with eczema. After more research  we found \\&quot;Theraplex Emollient\\&quot; - which is miles ahead of this garbage.    This product is basically Petroleum jelly, water and lanolin. If you must use Aquaphor, you will do much better to stick with just Petroleum Jelly minus the lanolin.    I write this review to try and inform parents of children with eczema. If Aquaphor works for you, by all means stick with it. But do try plain Vaseline as an alternative and a combination of Cetaphil+Theraplex emollient if other solutions haven&#x27;t worked. I have reviewed the Theraplex emollient and refer to that review for more information..</li>
    <li> This is some really awful stuff.  I give it one star only because it has to be done to do the review.  I have 2 jars of this awful heavy grease that I don&#x27;t know what to with but throw away.  Only problem was, I gave one jar to a friend who suffers from painful peeling finger tips.  You can&#x27;t do anything or touch anything if you put this on you.  It hasn&#x27;t helped her either.  So much for believing what you hear on the Dr Oz TV show. People, save your money and buy yourself a jar of Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of it and I used it for my dry chapped lips over night. The next day, my lips were soft and smooth. It is better than vaseline to me. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve been able to find that works on my daughter&#x27;s eczema, and I&#x27;ve tried everything. I especially like the tubs because it&#x27;s much easier to get enough of the ointment to apply onto a squirming toddler. With the tubes of this product, it was much harder to get out in the short amount of time that my daughter will allow it to be applied. I gave it four stars because it&#x27;s kind of greasy, and I&#x27;ve ruined a few of my clothes wrestling with a toddler while putting it on or just after. I now make sure that I&#x27;m wearing something I don&#x27;t mind ruining before applying it.</li>
    <li> I could not tell the difference between plain Vaseline and the Aquaphor. A waste of money, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> My knuckles dry out and crack badly during the winter. I had some especially painful and bleeding splits on my hand and asked my CVS pharmacist for her recommendation. She pointed me in the direction of Aquaphor. For three nights I applied Aquaphor before going to bed and wore white cotton gloves as I slept. After three days the dried, calloused skin around my wounds had become soft and the split skin was healing! Aquaphor is a little greasy, but I have never found anything that heals my dry skin as quickly and fully as it has. I will keep a tub \\&quot;on hand\\&quot; for the rest of my life! You can see a photo of my knuckles after three days of using Aquaphor in the product photo section.</li>
    <li> Tried this for our niece and nephew with exema, gave them relief from itching and cleared the red blotches.  I have dry skin on my legs so I tried it and it is great.  It is a bit like Vaseline, just need to give it a little time to soak in.</li>
    <li> i would like towait for experience of using, the box is beautiful and can hold for a long time. thanks</li>
    <li> I have areas of dry skin on my fingers which crack. I use aquaphor every night with a bandaid and it&#x27;s been working great. Also nice for your lips and face during cold months. Also good for burns and scrapes that sting. The only downside, and why I gave this 4/5 stars, is that it stays extremely sticky and if you apply too much you need to be careful of touching things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and i absolutely Love it! i have really sensitive skin and this helps me a lot, couldnt survive a winter time w/o it!</li>
    <li> If you like lathering cooking oil on your body and enjoy that slimy effect on your skin, you will love this greasy lotion. As for me, I prefer actual lotion.</li>
    <li> This works for my baby&#x27;s facial eczema. There can be many causes for eczema and there&#x27;s no one cure all out there. I previously tried Aveeno, Waleda Diaper Cream, and A&amp;D Cream and the results were less than optimal. Despite some of the same ingredients as Vaseline and A&amp;D Cream (Petrolatum &amp; Lanolin), Aquaphor seems to work better. One application will result in a greasy layer on the skin. I think that&#x27;s helpful to the skin because it seals in the moisture and leaves a coat between skin and clothing. I saw noticeable results by the afternoon after an early morning application. What does one do with two large 14oz jars though?</li>
    <li> I started using aquaphor on my son because of his extremely dry skin. It works fabulously when applied directly after he gets out of the shower to retain the moisture in his skin. It is very heavy and needs to be applied a little bit more thinly in the summer, but it works great all year long. I liked it so much and it worked so well, the whole family uses it and I even subscribed to it. It is worth the money, and Amazon&#x27;s subscribe-and-save prices are the best I could find, even compared to store coupons. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> My son has been suffering from eszema since he was five years old. Ever since his dermatologist recommended Aquaphor, his skin cleared up beautifully. Plus, I like the price for two jars instead of one. Very conveninet and economical. Thank you.</li>
    <li> If you want to seriously soften and smooth your skin and have it last, nothing can beat this stuff. After a few nights of smoothing this on my legs and arms my skin takes on a new silky soft happy quality and if I stop using this that quality will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts, abrasions, and scars will be gone after using this a few nights. Any calloused spots like the heels will be soft and smooth and with daily use will no longer feel like callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any type of skin irritation, itchiness, rawness, or eczema try this before anything else. This is skin medicine. I have used this on itchy areas when nothing else worked, including bug bites. This stops the itch. Also use this before any type of work that is hard on your hands. It will protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the secret to ageless hands if you have the discipline: a thick coat of this under white cotton gloves at night, every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 41% petroleum jelly. Inactive ingredients are: mineral oil, ceresin, lanolin alcohol, panthenol, glycerin, and bisabotol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s greasy but so what, it just works. Skin adores it. I even use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using expensive cosmetic moisturizers at night. I just use this. It&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> Having persistent mild acne, my Dermatologist put me on Accutane. The drug essentially stops your body from producing oil, which leads to horrible cracked lips and dry skin pretty much everywhere. Applying Aquaphor to my lips nightly will heal the dry skin by morning, and a few applications throughout the day will significantly help the burning and drying my my lips. Works great on dry knees, ankles and elbows as well.  If you are unfortunate enough to be on Accutane, this will significantly help your experience on the drug, otherwise, this is just a terrific moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews of this product complaining that it&#x27;s an expensive version of Vaseline, which I sympathize with. Having had severe-moderate psoriasis for years, I have lots of experience with Vaseline and various other greasy, heavy lotions. Aquaphor certainly LOOKS like Vaseline: it&#x27;s clear and kind of slimy. But there are nonetheless perceptible differences between the two. Aquaphor&#x27;s consistency is much better. It&#x27;s thicker, it stays on the skin longer, it absorbs better, it doesn&#x27;t rub off onto everything as quickly, it isn&#x27;t quite as greasy. I would (and do) pay the extra price to use this product over Vaseline any day. They are not the same product.    This subscribe and save deal, moreover, is the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever found this stuff anywhere. In the store, you&#x27;ll pay $14-$16 for one container this size. So if you have dry skin or a skin condition and use lotion every day like me, you should look into this offer while it lasts.</li>
    <li> I had stitches recently and my dermatologist recommended this product for the healing process.  It worked pretty well on my stitches as well as on the surrounding skin when it got itchy from the bandages.  I also used this on some skin that was irritated from too much sunlight (borderline sunburn, I guess).  This product provides almost instant relief.  It&#x27;s a bit thick and greasy, though not as greasy as petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> This product is the only ointment that works with my skin. I put it on after I get out of the shower and before I go to sleep at night and it has helped with my constant dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Aquaphor for many years, but this is the first time I bought it from Amazon.  Both cans contain chunky stuff which is unlike all the others I previously used.  I am not sure whether this is a defective batch from the manufacturer or some other reasons.  I would hesitate to repeat an order on Amazon of this again.</li>
    <li> My son has serious skin issues that no other lotions have worked for. Aquaphor treats is skin and keeps it soft with no cracking. A great price and fast delivery from Amazon is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> So I work long hours in steel toed boots. When I get home it is a welcome opportunity to remove them and relax with a little Netflix and a nice meal. About a month ago, I noticed redness and soreness, along with dry and itchy skin. I found I had eczema. It was also on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurt, made walking painful and lead to hands that looked like I had had a chemical bath in lye and moisturized with sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I needed something to fix this. Being a \\&quot;dude\\&quot; with no knowledge of moisturizing product, I turned to regular skin lotion. It did little to nothing to help me.... Having used Auqaphor on tattoos in the past, I followed the advice of those on the internet to hopefully cure my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first night, I woke to find my cracked, itchy skin to feel a bit better. Over the weekend I continued to apply it in general doses to the affected areas to find that not only had the pain left, but that I now had a miricle cure of sorts. Yes, it is thick and sticky, but it left my feet and hands (my life&#x27;s blood) in a MUCH better condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, after only three days, my eczema (which was in a VERY painful state) is not 100% gone yet, I can go to work knowing the tearing pain of incredibly dry skin is being quickly taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m neither a doctor, nor a parent, so I would suggest further research before use on a child. But I can speak for myself and say that I was so pleased, I felt the need to write a review.</li>
    <li> This healing ointment works well for people who have sensitive, aging or skin that is exposed to lots of sun.</li>
    <li> burns, scrapes, scratches, dry skin, rashes, this stuff cures so many ailments that it&#x27;s a definite must-have for us.  We used to have the smaller packs of aquaphor but when we were preparing for our new baby, we figured we&#x27;d want this extra-large tub.  Love aquaphor :-)</li>
    <li> This Aquaphor \\&quot;Healing Ointment\\&quot; was provided to me by a woundcare doctor that was treating me for a fairly rare skin condition, called \\&quot;Pyoderma Gangrenosum\\&quot; (warning, don&#x27;t look that up on a full stomach), that leaves large thin skin scars when it heals. The scarred skin is easily damaged and needs to be protected, which Aquaphor does much better than anything else we have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does go on somewhat greasy, but it also softens the skin and makes the wound area look much healthier. I have not had trouble with random skin rips or irritation that afflicted me before using this as part of my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s summer, the worst time for dry skin.  You have just come out of winter and now you need to be ready for sandals and short&lt;br /&gt;sleeved tops.  Impossible, but not anymore.  I will never be without this cream again.  It said to give it 3 days, but within 24 hours I was ready for sunshine.  I heard about Aquaphor from Dr. Oz and I am a firm believer.  It has a slight greasy feel when first applied, but this will soak in and you are ready to go.  It&#x27;s worth the price, it goes far.  This is a must.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing!!!  I have problems with excessively dry skin on feet and hands.  I put this on before I go to bed and when I wake up I have soft skin again. In use it on my calves too.  Best stuff around!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my 8 month old baby who has had eczema since he was a month old.  I apply it twice a day on damp skin (aids with absorption).  This product is exactly the same as the Aquaphor Baby Healing Ointment (check the company&#x27;s FAQ section in their website) and it&#x27;s less expensive too!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what the label claims--it has healing properties, it is certainly more advanced than petrolatum and dry hands, heels and everything in between will benefit from its therapeutic effects. And for such a heavy ointment, it absorbs remarkably quickly.  Even the dogs enjoy its healing effects.  One of our Weims flaps his ears so enthusiastically that the skin tears.  Since we started to rub Aquaphor on them, his beautiful ears remain wound free and cashmere soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how or why it works better than Vaseline, but I&#x27;ve compared both and Aquaphor is more effective at repairing cracked skin, as well as, forming a protective barrier to combat nature&#x27;s effects especially during winter.  And while it might be  more expensive than Vaseline, this tub lasts such a long time that the cost is negligible when viewed over the long term.  We use it for everything and everyone, including the four legged members of the family, and it&#x27;s made all the difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a bit greasy when you first put it on but WOW it works wonders!  My wife and I both use it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My baby have a very sensitive skin. I did some research on the web and found this one. I have been using this product in every diaper change since my baby was born, he is 3 months now and never had a rash.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very dry skin and this worked great. After a bath I would put losts on then put her PJ&#x27;s on to hold onto the mostiure. Great Stuff</li>
    <li> I used this product after sunburn on the lips and it&#x27;s amazing. You can use it all over but my dermatologist recommended it and it performed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was having an eczema flare-up in August due to all the dry heat where I live.  I remembered that I had tried this product in the past so I thought I would again.  But after a few days, I noticed that my eczema was getting worse, then much more worse.  It literally covered my whole back, torso, thighs, calves, and the inside of my arms.  I tried narrowing down what could have caused it, and I had to go in to the doctor to get a steroid cream, which I really don&#x27;t like to use because I&#x27;m scared of thinning skin.  I stopped using the Aquaphor, and with the steroid cream, my skin cleared up.  The only thing I can think of is that I developed an allergy to lanolin, which is in Aquaphor.  So if you have very sensitive skin that reacts to common allergens, I would stay away from this product.  I started using Aveeno&#x27;s lotion specifically designed for eczema (from Amazon), which works well, but it only comes in a small tube.  I applied it twice a day, and my eczema almost went away completely without the steroid cream.  The regular Aveeno lotion does not work for me at all, my skin absorbs it immediately, and I have to put on multiple layers throughout the day.  I bought Cetaphil lotion today in a two-pack from Costco upon recommendation from my doctor, and so far it seems to be similar to the Aveeno eczema product.  It goes on very smooth and does not immediately absorb into my skin.  You can also buy it in the two-pack from Amazon for a couple more dollars than Costco.</li>
    <li> I was told to use this by my tattoo artist for the first few weeks after getting my tattoo and it has been a life saver! It made my skin look wonderful and helped with the healing process and sped it up like no other! Yes it is a little sticky but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> As a person with a disability, wheelchair user, one of the challenges I face is skin breakdowns.  This product is excellent.  Simply rub some on problem areas when they are red, or a slight scratch or welt appears and two days later your skin will look 100x better.</li>
    <li> While it may seem unlikely, this is the best thing I have ever found to help heal tattoos. This is not \\&quot;expensive vaseline\\&quot; as one reviewer comments. A look at ingredients would show you this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am heavily tattooed and I have always been advised to use \\&quot;unscented plain lotion\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I used to swear by Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Milk and Honey lotion, though it does contain fragrance. It always did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I got a large portion of my left arm done and the area was drying too quickly in such large patches for lotion to help. At the advice of my artist, I purched Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor saved my tattoo and has since become a part of my tattoo ritual. When I get a fresh tattoo, for the first few nights, I lighty coat in aquaphor and wrap in plastic wrap and sleep like this over night. In the morning, I wash the area. By the third or fourth day, the areas of skin that would scab and last for days under normal after care, just roll right off in the shower. My tattoos heal in under one week and remain brighter and more colorful with the help of aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have everyone I know using it and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever use anything else. All aftercare products marketed for tattoos specifically have seemed like a joke to me compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it&#x27;s not cheap, but after paying almost $1,000 to have someone tattoo an original work of art that covers my entire arm, I think it&#x27;s worth it to keep it beautiful. I&#x27;ve used Aquaphor on about a dozen of my tatoos and most people can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them some of the tattoos were done years ago. The color held so well they look like they were just done.</li>
    <li> Saved my dad&#x27;s life --- he was totally relieved after applying Aquaphor Ointment from an ichy, swallen, chapped face due to pollen allergy. He loves it so much that he asked me to buy him two big jars when he went back to China and this is the only thing that he asked me to buy for him.</li>
    <li> I use Aquaphor for dry skin (which my eczema-prone family has plenty of), chapped lips, protecting baby bottoms, and soothing \\&quot;owies\\&quot;. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I had second degree burns on my face from a fire that left me devastated.  The hospital used Aquafor for the burns on my face.  Nine months later. using aquafor, you would never know that I was burned at all.  The product is greasy but I apply it with a qutip.  I also use it for exema on my elbows.  Always have a jar in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
    <li> This product has been used in the past for burns, scrapes and cracked skin.  I was introduced to Aquaphor by my tattoo artist to aid in the healing and irritated skin produced by getting a tattoo.  This two-pack of 14 ounces each cost me what I paid locally for an 8 ounce container of the exact same product.  Whether you sign up for a subscription to the product or not it&#x27;s still worth buying on Amazon.  I rubbed my wife&#x27;s feet with a bit of Aquaphor and the next morning her feet were baby soft.  Needless to say you can find more and more uses for this as product the more you use it.  Lastly, it&#x27;s made by Eucerin; one of the top lotion products that was ever produced.</li>
    <li> I got this product per my tattoo artist recommendation. I was originally going to use Vaseline but he said that Aquaphor lets the skin breathe better because it is only 40% Petrolatum. Whereas Vaseline is 100% Petrolatum and clogs pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m in the house I apply a little, a thin layer to keep it moist and to not let it dry out and risk messing up the artwork. When I leave for school or work I apply a thick layer because it will be rubbing against my pants and I do not want all of it to rub off and leave my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seals the little cuts very well not allowing any germs in there and reduces irritation and the urge to scratch. My hands feel really soft and silky after washing off the Aquaphor too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s probably a ton of other uses for this product but for what I&#x27;m using it for it&#x27;s working wonders. My tattoo is healing beautifully, it keeps the area moist much longer than lotion would, it makes the colors stand out more, it protects against germs by acting as a sealant, and my skin feels really soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m curious to try out the Eucerin Original Moisturizing Creme now. I wish Amazon had a Prime special for the Aquaphor and the Creme.</li>
    <li> You can not find a better price for this number one, also this is the ONLY product that I find to work on rough elbows, UNBELIEVABLE, Yes, to some there seems to be a consensus that it is the same as vasille well it that was the case trust me I would not send this kind of money if I can spend like 3 dollars. There are 2 other ingredients in this product and I can only assume that the way they formulate this is way it works. So if you think it&#x27;s the same as vasille than by all means stick to it. NOT ME!!!!100 STARS</li>
    <li> petroleum chemicals are potentially harmful. why expose your baby to that? use 100% pure almond oil instead. that said, this product is good quality, but we wont be buying it again in the near term.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It works great to moisturize one&#x27;s skin.  The only drawback is that it is as thick as vaseline. I apply after my shower then put on a nightgown. Whatever you wear after applying this ointment will  need to be washed before you wear it again.  On the plus side.... And for me this is a BIG plus.... It really does work and does not have to be applied every day.  My skin stays soft and moisturized for several days, even with daily showers.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me for dry skin, and after I bought my first tube, it&#x27;s all I use. I use it as a chapstick and a hand moisturizer - I apply it to my hands every single time I wash them. My skin is soft, my eczema symptoms are gone, and my lips are happy. Yay! This size is definitely the best value.</li>
    <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about Aquaphor Healing Ointment is that it&#x27;s not calling itself a \\&quot;moisturizer.\\&quot; Take that as a hint -- it&#x27;s not for casual, all-day use. For that, I recommend the peerless [[ASIN:B001E96L6I Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion]]. This Aquaphor ointment is what I turn to when my hands or elbows or toes or heels are severely distressed. It&#x27;s heavy, it&#x27;s greasy, it doesn&#x27;t rub in very well, and I don&#x27;t mind, because it really works as advertised: it truly heals the rawest, itchiest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use this ointment is at night. I&#x27;ve been known to go to bed with medical [[ASIN:B0001EL41O white cotton gloves]] over a slathering of Aquaphor when gardening or cleaning has really torn up my skin. The change the next morning is amazing. A little experimentation also taught me to put a \\&quot;base coat\\&quot; of this ointment on my hands whenever I&#x27;m about to undertake some work that I know will mess them up. Because Aquaphor is so thick and greasy, it actually repels water and dirt, greatly decreasing the amount of damage caused by washing dishes, digging in dirt, cleaning up, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Aquaphor Healing Ointment is heavy-duty. It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty (though it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either). It&#x27;s not light and airy. It&#x27;s not dainty. It doesn&#x27;t have a picture of flowers on it, and it doesn&#x27;t make you feel \\&quot;pampered.\\&quot; It&#x27;s medicine, and it works.</li>
    <li> My father is in a nursing home,wears Depends and he sits in a wheelchair all day. He developed large nasty rashes (with whelts) that no matter what the doctor prescribed, it would not go away. Actually, it seemed to get worse. I had heard from a mother with a young child the wonders of Aquaphor and Aquaphor mixed (equal amounts) with Maalox. I took a jar of Aquaphor and a container with the mixture and told the nursing home what it was for and what to do with it.  They used the mixture first as the rash was really bad. By the next morning they could see results of the healing. They switched to the regular Aquaphor a couple of days later and the rash has since gone away.  Now, when any sign of irratation is noticed, they apply it right away and prevent any more rashes.  Aquaphor will be a mainstay not only in my home but in the nursing home. It&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have cellulitis of the legs and have tried many ointments from Doctors. Was told by friend about Aquaphor - got it and tried it...it worked. What more can I say.....</li>
    <li> I got what I ordered when I expected it. Got what I ordered before they said I would. I got what I ordered when I expected it. Got what I ordered when they said I would.I got what I ordered when I expected it. Got what I ordered when they said I would.I got what I ordered when I expected it. Got what I ordered when they said I would.I got what I ordered when I expected it.</li>
    <li> My heels are dry and peeling.  I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for something that can smooth out the rough area...even to a specialized cream JUST for heels.  Nothing worked, or at least, with one that I can get easily.  A couple of acquaintances recommended this product.  I found one at my local drugstore.  Luckily, it was on sale, because it was pretty pricey.  It&#x27;s basically like a petroleum jelly with mineral oil.  It&#x27;s heavy and smells like baby oil...and it works GREAT!  I have a 14 oz jar and it&#x27;s more than enough for my entire family to use.  (Since you only need a small dab, this jar will last us for a long, long time.)  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this for our feet in the family. IT works so well to keep the tough skin of your feet soft and supple. great buy</li>
    <li> Aquaphor was used after a facial chemical peel.  It did it&#x27;s job, but is extremely greasy and messy.  I had to throw away towels and sheets when done with the product.</li>
    <li> I have the worst skin ever at age 64 due to sun exposure. With daily use of this product my skin stay soft and less itchy. I also noticed that my fingernails are stronger and less dry using this product. It is light, not very greasy and is absorbed quickly. Using it twice a day from the neck down has really made a difference. I will use this the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Best stuff for dry skin EVER!!! I exfoliate in the shower then this is applied head to toe. With regular use and exfoliation, it will turn your skin to baby-butt-softness. Spreads really easily on you super dry skin for instant relief.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great for my tattoos, I highly recomend it if you are thinking about inking</li>
    <li> When my skin gets really dry and cracks this works great.  I even use it on dry cracked lips.  It works better than lip balms</li>
    <li> I was told to use it for my new tattoo, but after a few days. It caused me to break out in a very itchy rash that wont go away. It&#x27;s a miserable feeling.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is simply the best for dry skin problems. I use it on my lips, on my skin that has eczema blotches and sometimes use it as a diaper cream for my bub. The tub can last me about a year, and I keep a tube in my purse for my lips. I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals or dyes or perfumes, which is another big win!</li>
    <li> This is now our go to product. It helps with our daughters diaper rash. It is very similar to the feel of Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Aquaphor by my tattoo artist, which he suggested to use on my new tattoo for the first few days of healing. It has since become an ointment we use for so many things. dry  hands and feet, diaper rash preventative for baby, lip protectant in the winter and of course tattoo healer. I will always have Aquaphor in my house.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I realized that it is not a cream but petroleum jelly.  My doctor recommended this to me for my dry skin, she told me to just slab it on.  If you want to look like a shiny greasy alien in a movie, go ahead!!!  Doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin at all, just buy vaseline and save about [...] bucks, LOL.</li>
    <li> Manages my itchy dermatitis quite well. My order was well packaged and arrived much sooner than I&#x27;d expected. No complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I used this product on the recommendation of my dermatologist to help get a medical cream into my skin better.  I put the medicine on my hands, the Aquaphor on and then a pair of fingerless gloves.  My hands were so soft I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  My husband and I both believe that the age spots went away too.  I don&#x27;t do it as often now that I don&#x27;t need the medicine because I don&#x27;t like sleeping in the gloves.  My hands show it too!!</li>
    <li> The delivery was a little bit slower than I expected, but it was decent. I like this product because there is no smell, and it actually works!</li>
    <li> My son had severe eczema his entire life. His skin was always itching, and he scratched all the time. Two months ago, he had an awful skin infection that resulted in bumps and sores on his body especially in the areas where the eczema was the worst. We took him to the doctor, and he prescribed steroid medication and antibiotics. The doctor also gave us a sample of aquaphor. I started using the sample morning and evening. I then ordered the 14 ounce jars from amazon, and I continued to use the aquaphor on him morning and evening. It did wonders! My son&#x27;s skin stayed moist the entire day. Aquaphor worked.</li>
    <li> This product I already rated, like I stated previously.  I love it. You can see I needed to write b8 more words, YOU SHOULD SEE THIS PRODUCT WAS ALREADY RATED ABOVE.....</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading reviews by other psoriasis sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a thinner version of vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;It worked well for me, these huge tubs will last a long time, it did not irritate my skin or turn it red as some other acidic moisturisers have.&lt;br /&gt;I only needed to apply a thin film, it gets a bit too messy if you apply a lot.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time for my very dry feet and it has been the only thing over years and years of trying other lotions/creams that has worked on my feet.  My feet feel wonderful using this product.</li>
    <li> I only gave it a 3 star because I don&#x27;t like the feel on my skin&lt;br /&gt;it is too sticky and thick and hard to absorb into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;However if it weren&#x27;t for this, I would give it a 5 star, it does&lt;br /&gt;improve your skin almost immediately. I bought it for one reason,&lt;br /&gt;to help my very dry skin, and it DOES DO THE JOB. My skin&lt;br /&gt;is so much better with only a few applications. Hint to users&lt;br /&gt;Use it at night with socks or gloves on and you will be amazed&lt;br /&gt;at how good it works.</li>
    <li> Well, there might be something better, but I haven&#x27;t found it. I began using this product months ago because of skin allergies and generally dry skin after it was recommended by my sister in law who uses it for mild eczema that my niece has.     I agree completely with the other reviewer. This product is NOT simply a knock off of Vaseline. Look at the ingredients and it&#x27;s quite simple to see that there is more in this stuff than just petrolatum. To me it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or feel that greasy either. Furthermore, it feels easier to apply, almost less viscous. It does a great job of sealing in moisture and keeping skin soft. Also, to echo the other reviewer, the subscribe and save offer makes this size of Aquaphor cheaper than anywhere you&#x27;ll find it. Never seen it for less than $13 in the stores, plus I don&#x27;t pay tax or shipping from Amazon. Hopefully this price and offer last a while.</li>
    <li> It really does an excellent job for your feet or hands, elbows, neck ect if you moisturize with your choice of product and then put a thin amount of this to cover and seal in moisture. Works a miracle on cuticles overnight. You just have to take the time and effort to rub this end. It isn&#x27;t going to give you the results you want if you do not work it into your skin. Minus side is no matter how long you massage this in, it still leaves wherever you put it a definite Vaseline greasy feel. Check the ingredients on the jar and all it is is many types of moisturizers in a Vaseline base. You can put your own stuff together if you want, a lot of people have forgotten how good glycerin works when added to a cream.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product. it was originally recommended by a friend for my new tattoo. Then one day i noticed my feet were severely dry and lotion was not helping at all and i was using Jergans ultra healing...i decided to give this a try it was just sitting there. after i applied it i put some thick cozy socks on and the morning i woke up i could feel a difference...not that my feet were baby smooth but i could tell the difference ever since i put this stuff on everytime i get out the shower and it works wonders! GREAT FOR VERY DRY SKIN! i also applied it on my lips because my chapstick was in the car. as soon as all of it settled in i noticed a difference immediately. i just broke out on the right side of my face and i applied some as i heard it works with acne as well. i am amazed this stuff truely does work. it is a bit greasy..it is not lotion its medicine i love this stuff ! you can use it pretty much on anything. great for the price</li>
    <li> Have been using for some time and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  I use it around eyes and cheeks and face at night and it really helps moisturize my skin. I also use it on neck. Feels a bit thick at first, but once you spread it around, you get used to it. Never been a better lip balm either. This high percentage petroleum jelly is the best!</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is literally the best lip balm I have ever used..I am currently on acutane and at one point I thought my lips may actually fall off, the corners of my mouth were so dry and irritated, I looked like the joker from batman...I&#x27;ve tried so many chapsticks/lip balms, but none of them really contained or healed the dryness, that is until I discovered aquaphor aka a miracle lip balm. I used it one night over night and by the morning my lips were 90% better, I used it throughout the day and by then they were almost 100% healed. I LOVE YOU AQUAPHOR thank you for giving my lips hope in this time of dryness.</li>
    <li> I am not sure exactly what makes this different than regular vasoline petroleum jelly. Really, I cannot see what the difference is. I use it for bike rides, and its definitely a LOT cheaper than the bike specific stuff, and does not wear off with water...but those are also features of petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> I really love the cream, I bought it for my daughters that have ezcema and works very well like moisturizing. I bought this product twice for amazon and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to avoid dry skin.</li>
    <li> When I had to have radiation for skin cancer a couple of years ago the radiation lab gave me some of this Aquahor to use on my red, raw, and itchy skin.  They told me this is the safest product for the skin.  I have been using it ever after.  It seems a bit heavy and sticky at first  but I use it all the time now, after my bath and on my lips--everywhere. It will never irritate the skin.  I always have a jar nearby.</li>
    <li> I am a senior citizen. I found that the lotions I use to buy was no longer working for me. I wondered what should I buy? Reminiscing way back in time, I recalled some old home remedies. I found what I was looking for in Aquaphor Healing Ointment! It puts a &#x27;working greasy film&#x27; on my skin that slowly soaks into my skin fighting the dryness and heals my old body of wearing &#x27;time&#x27;! I am very happy to find such a GREAT working old formula! Thank You. .</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my sister for dry skin. It worked within a few days. Oily, so I put it on at night. Pleased with the product and timeliness of delivery.</li>
    <li> I purchased this ointment because I was having problems with my skin. I use this ointment everyday and it has had a great effect. It is oily but it has made a big difference. My skin is not as irritated and is clearing up from what the doctor said was eczema.</li>
    <li> This is used on the advice of my dermatologist.  I put it on my hands at night and then cover with white cotton gloves.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great...had some chafing in a very uncomfortable spot.  Applied this stuff and it was better the very next day!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, but it IS thick and somewhat greasy.  I was having a terrible time with dry itchy legs and arms - so the point they were bleeding from excessive scratching. I tried everything - then a pharmacist at Costco recommended I try this and what a difference.  I use it right after showering - legs, arms, and massage the rest into my hands.  Yes, it&#x27;s thick, but, oh my gosh, my legs and arms no longer dried out . . EVER! and it feels wonderful doing a quick massage - no more work than using any other lotions I tried..  By the time I get dressed it is no longer greasy.  I have used it for years - and now I order from amazon for an even better price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, neutral... I use it on my feet and my ahem and my Ahem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really keeps things supple, moisturized, and provides immediate relief for any kind of chafing or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, have reordered many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dole it out to smaller vessels like little Nalgene containers so I can take some on the road or in a bag.</li>
    <li> I have used Aquaphor for the last several  years.  It does a great job of hydrating my dry skin.  The jars I received were the same as before only cheaper and they arrived at my door instead of me going to the store.</li>
    <li> If used consistently, it will soften hands.  How it&#x27;s different from regular petroleum jelly, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doctor and is the best aquapor formula there is.  Works like a charm and no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I got this at the suggestion of my specialist.  It healed my skin so quickly.  I  never go without it.  Perfect to put on dry skin in the winter.  I like to slather it on my feet and put socks on when I go to bed.  It is cheaper to buy it by the tub than the tube.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for anyone with a baby in winter months.  It&#x27;s nontoxic so if the baby you put it on the baby&#x27;s hand and they suck, no problem.  It&#x27;s great for rahes, cuts, and dry patches.  It&#x27;s my first got to for any skin ailments. It is very thick (but absorbs into the skin) and the oil can leave a stain on some clothing. There is no difference between this and the baby aqua poor except the baby is more expensive.</li>
    <li> I am in my wheelchair full time and consistent use of Auquaphor keeps the skin on my bottom from breaking down.</li>
    <li> Great for skin regrowth...recovery.....</li>
    <li> I nave very dry and some times itchy skin Aquaphor does a good job getting relief. It is the only product that my dermentologist recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 years old and have had awful breakouts over the last few years.  After going on Differin about a month ago, my skin began to dry out horribly and was made worse by the winter weather.  It became so bad that the skin on my face was literally flaking off all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week ago I dug up a tube of Aquaphor that I had bought months ago for some reason but never used, and slathered my face with it before bedtime.  When I woke up, my face was completely back to normal.  No flaking, no red patches, no dryness... I was shocked and so relieved.  For a week now I&#x27;ve been putting a relatively thick layer on my face every night before bed, and my skin is the softest that it has ever been before.  Today I even got a compliment from my boyfriend, who said, \\&quot;Your face is so soft! How did you make it so soft?\\&quot; I can&#x27;t stop touching it either; it&#x27;s truly remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, no breakouts.  This product is the best.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using this creme on my skin. I&#x27;ll admit that. It&#x27;s so greasy that I will only submit to applying this lotion when I&#x27;m crawling into bed. Any other time, and I just can&#x27;t stand the feeling of leaving grease marks on anything I touch. When I&#x27;m in bed, at least I know I won&#x27;t be touching anything that can&#x27;t be easily washed. That said, when I DO happen to use it, it seems to repair my skin better than any other topical lotion I&#x27;ve tried. OK, I guess [[ASIN:B001FB5IIC Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]] is about the same, in terms of restorative properties. Still, compared to most moisturizing lotions, this stuff is great. There are some days when I am drywalling, and I spend hours using joint compound, washing it off my hands, sanding it off walls, and scrubbing clean my tools. All the repeated washing and exposure to dusty compound really sucks the moisture out of my skin and leaves my hands a swollen, dry, rough mess at the end of the day. On those days, I need stuff like Eucerin to help heal my hands while I&#x27;m sleeping. Otherwise, after a few days of this kind of work, the skin on my hands is so badly chapped and cracked that I don&#x27;t like them touching anything at all. If you are in any sort of occupation that has resulted in dry, weary hands, you should give this stuff a try. It can really work wonders!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for me. Get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
    <li> I have used this for my son and myself.  Very useful.  When my son had severe eczema with torn skin, this is a concoction I made that helped him heal:  About 1 tsp Aquaphor, 1/2 to 1/4 tsp Hydrocortisone Cream at .5% (half a percent), and about 1/4 tsp Neosporin.  Mix it on the palm of hand or on a cosmetic pad and apply on the affected area.    The measurements were eyeballed, not really used with a measuring device.  The Aquaphor is to help heal the skin while the hydrocortisone is to help with severe itchiness, and the Neosporin is to help with healing and infection of torn skin.    Since he doesn&#x27;t have such bad breakouts anymore, when he does show signs of irritation, I just use the Aquaphor.  When he itches a lot though, I still have to put Aquaphor mixed with a little Hydrocortisone cream/ointment.    Here is the ingredient for Aquahpor Healing Ointment: Active Ingredient- Petrolatum.  Other Ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol.    The concoction I made was what worked for my son.  I know there are other concoctions that can be made also, but don&#x27;t have the time to post.    I use Aquaphor on days when my hands are tearing from constant wetness.  I also use it for the chest area to protect rubbing of the bra, of course with a breast pad.  This stuff can get through the shirt and make the shirt look wet.    This two pack deal works very well for me on a subscription basis.    Other reviewers are better at expressing the quality of this product.    Oh, another note!  This works well for the nose inured from all the nose blowing with the tissue when I&#x27;m sick.  I leave a little layer around my nose so the next time I use tissue, I am not just touching my nose directly.</li>
    <li> This product, Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy, is the best I have ever used for skin which has become dry, cracked and rough from the winter climate.  It feels greasy when first applied but after a few minutes the skin becomes smooth and soft.  The ointment seems to be absorbed by the skin within minutes, and the feel and look of the skin changes dramatically from rough and flaky to a smooth soft glow.  Anyway, that&#x27;s been my experience with this product.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommends this ointment for so many things.  I have very dry skin and some psoriasis and this product is great.</li>
    <li> All of my kids have sensitive skin and I have used aquaphor as their diaper cream.  We use the aquaphor with every diaper change and protects well.  Highly recommend aquaphor over vaseline.</li>
    <li> Hi,I got items,Thank you</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is the best stuff ever!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. I started using it when I had a face peel for skin cancer it was pretty rough and raw the doctor told me to get Aquaphor and you will not believe how fast my face healed and a slick as a babies behind too.  This is a great product. I have used it ever scene for my and hands or any place you need to put lotion to relieve the redness of irritation.      ASIN:B001FB5IP0     Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</li>
    <li> This was the only thing that worked on my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash.  We tired everything!!!  Aveeno, Butt Paste, etc. Nothing worked  This is like magic.  Thank you Aquaphor!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for using as a barrier for dry skin. My daughter and I both have eczema really bad and I stopped using this product because it is so expensive 16-28 dollars a jar. Amazon has it so much cheaper so now I am using it again. The school nurse says it works even better if you mix it with aveeno extra dry skin lotion and she was right. Our skin feels so much softer after only using this combination for 2 weeks. My daughter hardly complains about her itching skin. We also started using the aveeno bath wash and the oatmeal packs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it truly works. I use it on my heels when I&#x27;ve spent the day in shoes, my dry hands, and fresh cuts to aid in healing. I always use it before going to bed and by the morning I&#x27;m left with better, moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this on my lips because it does have the texture of a thicker, more viscous Vaseline (but not as heavily scented) -but I could see why others might use it during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and it works way better than a lot of the products out there aimed towards cracked heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, in awkward situations where I forgot to bring makeup remover, this product is a good medium versus plain paper towels or toilet paper.</li>
    <li> This is my number one multi-tasker. I cannot seriously say enough good things about it. I use it on my cuticles, hands, feet, elbows, lips, and under my eyes at night. It is just absolutely phenomenal. One product does it all. I save so much money not having to buy cuticle cream or oil, lip balm or gloss (although I cannot pass up a fun tinted gloss), hand lotion, and body lotion. This is my go-to product. If I was deserted on an island, and could only pick one beauty product, this would be it.</li>
    <li> I agree with a reviewer about it making eczema worse. My son is now 4 and dealt with more eczema as a baby and toddler. I tried a few times with the Aquaphor. Worsened the eczema and caused severe itching. My daughter who is 7 months got a rash on her face where I applied it. I, like my son, have eczema and had severe itching on my hands when I used it to put on my kids. All in all, I dont understand the hype with this when petroleum jelly is a less allergenic emollient.</li>
    <li> This product is the best skin protection you can buy. We have tried other brands and they do not work as well.  Great product for price.</li>
    <li> Oils and lotions will not last all day.  I have scar tissue from burns that has no oil ducts and need a lubricant especially during dry winter and hot summer periods.  My dermatologist recommended Aquaphor several years ago and I&#x27;ve no problems since.</li>
    <li> Use it for hands, feet and even lips.  Great and really helps with dryness.  Not as greasy as Bag Balm.</li>
    <li> i RECEIVED Eucerin original healing - soothing and repair creme! I DID NOT ORDER FOR THIS! I WANT AS IN THE PIX !!!! FELT SOOO CHEATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have young kids, you either use Aquaphor every day or you are about to be introduced to the most versatile hygiene product there is for young children. This is great for keeping excema in check, treating scratches and small cuts, sore/irritated nether-regions (NOT fungal diaper rash), and is fantastic for adult skin problems too. There is a relatively unknown product called &amp;#34;Hydrolatum&amp;#34; which I think is marginally better, but we got by on this exclusively for the first two years of my kid&#x27;s life, and it remains a household staple.</li>
    <li> I was expecting that this &amp;#34;goup&amp;#34; would absorb into the tissues, but no, it sits on the surface and is exactly like Vaseline!  It&#x27;s impossible to function while wearing it, and having tried it, I see no improvement in affected areas.  I am shocked that a doctor actually recommended this ointment while appearing on the Dr Oz Show.  I would gladly return it for a refund, if I could.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t tell him I told you, but my husband&#x27;s feet leave a lot to be desired,  This product is great, it softens and makes a  difference in the appearance of his feet.  We have tried a number of products in the past and they soon fall by the way side because some really have not made that much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw this product on Dr Oz and thought we should try it.  Glad we did!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended that I purchase this product to aid in healing open wounds and help to moisturize the dry skin on my legs. I use two tubs a month. It&#x27;s worth every penny that I spend on it. There are two labels for this product. One directed at the baby market and one for everyone else. Both are the same as far as contents. Price is the same too. I&#x27;m nearing 70 and suffer from bad circulation in my legs. Because this has worked so well, my other medical expenses have been reduced considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another challenge I have is keeping nearly 60% of skin grafts (from a fire when I was ten) well lubricated. It works better then Mineral Oil and other creams/ointments. Highly recommended for anyone who have suffered any kind of a burn, whether by fire or by chemicals. Especially our service personnel returning for similar issues.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate and deal with extremely dry elbows and heals. Went on a 3-week raft trip thru the Grand Canyon and &amp;#34;a very good moisturizer&amp;#34; was recommended for daily use--they said the biggest problem on those trips was painful, split heels and dry cuticles that were easily infected.  I had tried just about every moisturizer out there--except Eucerin--so that was on my shopping list for the Grand Canyon.  I made a trip to Walmart and found both Eucerin, and Aquaphor (from the makers of Eucerin--same &#x27;tub,&#x27; same logo, etc.).  It cost a bit more, and was labeled &amp;#34;Advanced Therapy,&amp;#34; so I decided to give it a try.  IT WORKED LIKE NOTHING I&#x27;VE EVER TRIED.  While many others on our trip did, indeed, suffer from cracked heals and infected cuticles, I made the entire 3-week trip without a problem. I applied the Aquaphor daily (it&#x27;s virtually impervious to water and sweat), put on my  water booties, and by the end of the trip, I had baby-soft heals.  One of our guides commented that he had heard from other river guides that Aquaphor was an excellent product.  After returning home, I stopped using it on a daily basis, and once again, developed dry, cracked heals--very painful!  I applied the Aquaphor and the relief was almost immediate.  The cracks were closed in less than 24 hours.  This product really is amazing.  I have a friend who lives int he Rockies--very dry climate, her fingers are wrapped in Band-Aids all the time.  I sent a &#x27;tub&#x27; of Aquaphor to her and she&#x27;s still talking about it.  I really cannot believe I&#x27;ve finally found something that works!  (I did a bit of research on this product . . . while I&#x27;m sure the OTC version that we buy in Walmart is &#x27;watered down&#x27; for general use, the original product was developed for use by cancer patients going thru radiation treatment.)  It&#x27;s difficult to find.  After my purchase at Walmart, I was unable to find it in the store.  Finally located at Amazon in a two-pack (gift the 2nd one to a friend) at an excellent price.  Unless you slather it on every day, a tub of Aquaphor will last a long time.  The product itself . . . completely fragrance free, consistency and color of Vaseline but creamier--contact with body heat makes it smooth on easily.  I can apply to my heels and elbows, wash my hands thoroughly with soap and water, and I can still feel it on my hands.  And that&#x27;s the type of product it takes to protect and heal skin.  I use it every night and no longer have dry skin problems.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. After I had gotten waxed, I had a major wax burn (it happens), I didn&#x27;t have any aloe laying around, but I did have this! And boy did it work. It went from red to my normal color within 15 minutes of using it. It looks as if there was never a problem to begin with. Much appreciated</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dry, dehydrated skin since I was a little girl. My mom used to soak me in Olive Oil for a whole our before giving me a bath when I was little. Yes, I hated it and it was very unpleasant. However, this product is absolutely amazing. I highly, highly recommend it all who suffer from itchy dry or dehydrated skin. I use Gloves in a Bottle first after pat towel drying after a shower. I follow it up with Aquafor and I am blissfully flake free and itch free. Although it looks like sticky vaseline, it does not leave the skin feeling sticky or greasy. Absorbs quickly. I rub a little on the palm of my hand and then use it on my body. Goes on smooth. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I tend to have dry skin in the winter and moisturizing with it really helps. I find that he itching does not bother me when I use this stuff. messy though.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Best purchase ever. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. I totally recommend this item.  HIGH QUALITY AND GOOD PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> In the summertime my feet get extremely dry and I do a lot of walking so my feet are just in horrible condition.  I was getting so chapped to the point of it being painful so I asked my dermatologist what to do. She suggested alternating [[ASIN:B001FB5IIC Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]] with Aquaphor Healing Ointment Therapy on my feet at night.  I use the Aquaphor 2 times a week and the original Eucerin every other night.  I take a small amount (a little goes a long way with this thick ointment!) and apply it liberally to both feet and then cover them with a thick sock.  My feet immediately feel soothed and after a couple days of this treatment, my feet were softer and much less painful.  I strongly recommend this product! Just realize that this isn&#x27;t a traditional lotion- it&#x27;s an ointment (think the consistency of vaseline) so it can be a bit messy and not necessarily the most fragrant treatment out there but it DEFINITELY works!</li>
    <li> This is nothing but petroleum jelly..  I was very disappointed.especially after seeing it touted on Dr. OZ.  Stick with Eucerin Intensive Repair for a much better product.</li>
    <li> This product since I was 15. I love aquaphor, it makes my skin feel wonderful. It is also great for burns.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor Healing Ointment is a wonderful product, It soothes dry, burned skin. I was given a very expensive ointment to use following Pixel laser skin resurfacing on my face and it took 4-5 days before the redness and tightness went away. The last treatment I had I used only Aquaphor and 2 days later I had no redness and was able to wear makeup with no problems. This ointment is great for baby&#x27;s diaper rash, dry lips or any skin irritation. I always keep a spare. Don&#x27;t ever want to run out of it.</li>
    <li> this comes in a pack of two. may look way too much and you might think that it will last you a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;But it will barely last you 8 months. You need this if you have dry skin or eczema and you need to moisturize it everyday. My daughter has eczema and we use this together with Aveeno Eczema therapy lotion on her everyday and it keeps her soothed.</li>
    <li> I have recently undergone radiation treatments- I have found this to be even more soothing than the special radiation skin treatment cream for my worst &amp;#34;sunburnt: places.</li>
    <li> Must contain higher proportion of petroleum jelly than tube version because greasier texture. Very large container. Will last for ages. Much cheaper than in stores. Would be 5* if product had same nongreasy consistency as tube version.</li>
    <li> I do love it.  I work in a hospital &amp; have to wash my hands alot.  I use this product at night &amp; wear gloves to bed.</li>
    <li> a little like petroleum jelly but a good skin cream for hands that are very dry and rough. thanks for the good product</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great.  My feet are starting to clear up and for the first time in two years I can actually see my toes. Tried everything for fungus that the doctors gave and nothing worked until I found out about Aquaphor.  Only draw back that it did make my skin red which it said right on the jar that it could happen.</li>
    <li> Make no mistake, this will make you greasy.  Slippery hands, hard to turn a doorknob greasy.  It will also make your kiddo greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if your child has serious baby eczema, this is the best stuff on the planet for dealing with that.  Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for cleaning, Aquaphor for the flare ups, Eucerin Cream for the maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use cheaper generics, but that didn&#x27;t work out for me.  Maybe my kid has designer name-brand skin or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, this is also great for diaper rash; your own winter dried skin, chapped lips and hands, and can even be used to lubricate gaskets.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product, and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It worked on my dry skin on the first day.  Not as greasy as Vaseline.  I have used Vaseline all my life but aquaphor seems to be better.  ouch that hurt to admit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease since 1997. This is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract and it leads to ulcerations in the colon. Unfortunately, it also causes a bunch of other health problems like eczema. For me, the problem was mainly on my lower legs and elbows. Aquaphor is the only thing that has helped me so far. I use it after my shower and apply it fairly thick. It is greasy, but my skin is so dry that it&#x27;s usually absorbed within a few hours.</li>
    <li> Does its job but too greasy - rubs off on clothes &amp; won&#x27;t wash out.  Five more words required too.</li>
    <li> This is the best product that works like magic for my son. Glad amazon had it on sale, I grabbed it.</li>
    <li> I was told to use this on my dry feet by my dermatologist every night before bed...with socks preferably.  I have in the past on and off, but this time I listened and it really did work.  In the morning I would use a different foot cream and at night use Aquaphor.  It really does work, but you have to stick with for at least two weeks.</li>
    <li> This feels too much like Vaseline! It seems to stay on the surface of your skin instead of working with your skin.</li>
    <li> Very good for scratches.</li>
    <li> From diaper areas to chapped cheeks to raw noses after a cold, aquaphor can help heal it all. It&#x27;s not as pore clogging as vaseline but has all of the same moisturizing benefits. Love it!</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, Glamazons, there was a misprint in my last review, seriously, a MAJOR one. I am a human being and guess what???? Sometimes I make mistakes! This one just happened to be one that I didn&#x27;t proof read ahead of time, and therefore brought a hateful, and personal attack down upon me. On the bright side.. I am able to correct my mistake! Yay! Blessing in disguise! :-)  Here are the reasons I love this product, and so do  many physicians, estheticians, beauty experts etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline is 100% petrolatum, while Aquaphor is 41% petrolatum based. With that being said, I am NOT writing a negative review about vaseline (vaseline has it&#x27;s own positive attributes, I&#x27;m focusing on Aquaphor), I&#x27;m writing a positive one about Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor is more miscible with aqueous solutions than Vaseline. Vaseline is mainly used in lotions as a catalyst, or lubricant, Aquaphor is not used in lotions. Aquaphor is made up of 41% percent petrolatum while the rest of the ingredients are lanolin and glycerin. Pharmacists use Aquaphor as a base for pharmaceutical ointments, unlike vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, and my colleagues, clients etc. love to use this multi-tasker on our lips, with a little pigment mixed in you can make it any color. It&#x27;s great for hands and feet in the cold dry months, and is really soothing in a medicated version on cuts, burns and scrapes. These facts came from a pharmacist, and can also be found on differencebetween.net (vaseline vs. aquaphor). Love Aquaphor, I find it to be a household necessity as well as a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; in your makeup kit. My reviews are done in the light for the greater good of all. Thank you to the person who brought my mistake to light. Many blessings to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste,&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro</li>
    <li> My uncle has a very dry skin and he always wanted this product and this is the only one which works for him and he loves it</li>
    <li> the best of the healing creams</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is what was recommended by the shop when I got my tattoos, to keep the skin soft &amp; protect it while it healed.  A segment on a certain Dr&#x27;s show in the afternoon also mentioned it&#x27;s good to use to clear up diaper rash.  It has worked equally well for that too.</li>
    <li> Oh Amazon...I am a groupie.  Living in a rural area often product choices are limited and expensive.  These two generous jars will soothe/heal our household for a very long time.  Thanks again</li>
    <li> My radiation oncologist gave me samples of this to try during my radiation treatments. It kept my skin protected from clothing irritation so I purchased a larger container and am still using it. It washes completely out of clothes and sheets with no staining.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression it also contained camphor, which it did not. I have used this product before and it does work well.</li>
    <li> Our toddler son has skin issues, everything irritates him.  Since starting a nightly application of aquaphor, we have skin issues no more!  Sometimes the aquaphor gets skipped when I&#x27;m not home and I can tell the next day, skin is bumpy, prone to redness.  My poor son. This really helps him.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband &amp; he rates it as excellent!  The product is just what he needed</li>
    <li> Use a little bit every few days and you will have soft and supple skin.  A little goes along way, and it can be hard to spread sometimes - however, worth it.</li>
    <li> My pharmacist sister recommended this to me years ago.  My young children were getting badly chapped skin around their mouths and noses because we lived in a very cold, windy place.  I tried everything, but other products would sting and irritate their already chapped skin.  This product caused no pain whatsoever when I applied it, even when their skin was quite raw and irritated.  When used overnight, the improvement was remarkable.  My kids would go to bed with red, crusty patches and wake up with smooth, healthy skin again.  I use this on my hands every night during the winter months to keep my fingertips from getting rough and my knuckles from cracking.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but this tub lasts forever, and it&#x27;s an amazing product.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have had atopic dermatitis for my entire life.  Aquaphor has helped me keep it under control by never letting my skin dry out.  I use it liberally every day all over my body and on my hands many times a day.  Sure, it&#x27;s a little greasy but after a while it absorbs into your skin.  My allergy breakouts and itchy skin have been greatly reduced. I have tried lots of creams over the years and this is the best for extreme protection, which my skin seems to need.</li>
    <li> the product aquaphor is the best for very dry skin.  the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is greasy, but thats ok since works</li>
    <li> Best for use after each diaper change. Much better than Vaseline or other petroleum jellies.</li>
    <li> If you have rough skin on the heel of your foot, Aquaphor Ointment is exactly what you need. Daily use on your rough dry skin will make it soft as a Babys.... well you get the idea. It works great on rough dry hands also. My wife and I have used it every day for over 10 years. Great Product</li>
    <li> Very greasy but seriously works better than any other cream, even the most expensive creams.  Even though it looks like Vaseline, it contains many more minerals and natural softening agents than Vaseline.  The tub can seem pricey but the tub lasts forever, easily two years in my humble opinion.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This product works great for babies with sensitive skin.  Plus the smell is less pungent than other brands of ointment.</li>
    <li> I have had psoriasis for many years and was just looking for something&lt;br /&gt;to keep the scales soft.  This works in that respect.  It wasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;greasy as some have suggested and didn&#x27;t stain anything.  While&lt;br /&gt;there wasn&#x27;t a substantial improvement, it did keep the skin moist&lt;br /&gt;and you get a large amount for the money.</li>
    <li> I hav used the product as directed now for about 2 months now and have not seen any positive changes.  Too bad, I had high hopes.</li>
    <li> High quality high moisturising. Also, good price! Big size package...&lt;br /&gt;Use to possible For all skin. Easpecial kids &amp; cold season</li>
    <li> My toddler has naturally very dry skin and eczema and Aquaphor has been very helpful in keeping the skin moist.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> This product was too greasy and did not soak into my dry skin well at all.  I did not finish using it after several applications.</li>
    <li> I suffer from very sensitive dry skin on my hands (esp cuticles) and feet.  They used to crack and bleed easily in the winter and my nails are very brittle.  But this ointment really works on softening calluses and cracks,  and protecting/moisturizing nails.  I also have a girlfriend who swears that it works magic on deep eyebrow furrows.  It&#x27;s a thick,  gloopy ointment,  in texture it feels more like Vaseline than any cream.  It costs a lot more than Vaseline,  but it seems to work better,  and a lot more is relative,  you get a big jar for less than $25 and it lasts for ages.  I always have a jar of it in my house. A happy find.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old has eczema and I&#x27;ve been using aquaphor every since he was a baby. I&#x27;ve tried MANY different types of lotions and ointments and nothing works as well as good ole Aquaphor. I even tried some of the more expensive brands (like California Baby) and nothing comes close to this. These are large jars so I pour some into small containers and keep them in every room in the house. This also works great for preventing/treating diaper rash.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the hype; this is expensive vaseline. There is some kind of mega marketing, big Pharm push about this stuff...my dermatologist, who used to recommend polysporin for skin post-excism, now recommends this.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried it all. This ointment is the only one that suits by hubby. A healthier diet and a good rubbing of Aquafor morning and night seals the deal.</li>
    <li> First thing, this one is for my mother who was suffering with Psoriasis, and nothing worked on her skin until we tried Aquaphor. I now knew why many people call it magic gel... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for Amazon, I was lucky, I got it from Amazon. I tried e-bay, and was worried about the reputation and service of dealers there.... Amazon helped me with best price and amazing service, I received the package in India in just a week. Amazing service and very prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Ointment is a great moisturizer. Would recommend it to anyone. Price is also very good.I would not hesitate to buy again</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for cracked dry skin.  I use it at night with gloves/socks,and  my hands and feet are soft in the morning.  This is a very thick ointment, the consistency and texture of petroleum jelly.  Not something you can put on your hands in place of hand lotion.</li>
    <li> This looks like vaseline but far from it! Aquaphor is the best \\&quot;any\\&quot; body part ointment on the planet! It works wonders on dry, super dry or extremely dry face, hands, legs and feet. It spreads easily.The best part, it&#x27;s absorbent, unlike a vaseline that just lays on top of the skin. In the evening I put a tiny tad amount on each eye lid. I than apply a small amount to eye and cheek area. By bedtime it has absorbed enough to not ruin pillow cases. The next day I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT once I wash my face I&#x27;M NOT GOING RIGHT BACK TO DRY SKIN. It glows! I&#x27;ve had many, many people ask if I had eyelid surgery. I haven&#x27;t. It makes the skin over your eyes appear so much tighter! BONUS?? If you have \\&quot;dry eye\\&quot; this helps without the stinging and burning lotions and creams cause when applying to lids! I rub Aquaphor on my feet, slip socks on and by morning my feet are super soft. Seven years ago my doctor of dermatology recommended Aquaphor after a small laser procedure was done on my face. I&#x27;ve used it ever since!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product with every diaper change, so far very good result and no diaper rash. I only wished it had zinc oxide in it.</li>
    <li> I had a cold and all my skin around my nose and lip area was cracked and peeling.  I used this over some lotion one night, and the next morning my skin was great.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have really oily and acne-prone skin so I don&#x27;t use this on my face (99% of the time).  However, I have very dry skin on my hands, arms, and legs.  My legs will get so itchy from the dryness that I have actually scratched the skin off.  And I&#x27;ve tried numerous different lotions, including Aveeno.  My sisters use Aquaphor on their babies so I took some once and it seems to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a warm climate, but often travel to colder climates for work.  The dry airplane air and the colder climate makes my legs really dry out and itchy.  So now, I just rub this all over my legs on the days when I know I&#x27;ll be traveling on a plane and my legs don&#x27;t bother me anymore.  I also use this on my hands for several days when they start to get white and cracky around the knuckles.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday as it can get rather heavy, but it&#x27;s a good way to start treating a dry skin problem, then use regular lotion to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only times I&#x27;ll use this on my face are: (1) during the coldest winter months when my skin starts to crack around the corners of my lips, and (2) as I drive to my dentist appointment.  Dentist appointments always dry out my lips so I just put a thin layer on right before one.</li>
    <li> I have tried several hand creams including ones prescribed by my doctor and none are as effective as this. This product is even recommended on the doctors tv program. As it is an ointment, it does not absorb into the skin as quickly as some hand creams. But because it is so effective I have to rate it a 5/5!</li>
    <li> The occasional dry patch of skin, or minor skin irritation, can be handled by an old moisturizing cream.  However, when there is several cracked skin on the feet or elbows, the strength of a treatment like Aquaphor cannot be underestimated.  In addition, any time I have gotten a new tattoo, this has been best therapy while the skin heals.  Not only does it keep the expected pain and discomfort in check, it also helps mitigate the expected itching that will soon follow.  It&#x27;s a must have for the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Great product on hands, feet, legs and arms. Wonderful for severe diaper rash and babies with ultra sensitive skin. GREATEST PRODUCT EVER!!! HAVE ( NOT ) HAD ANYMORE PEELING OR BURNING OF FACIAL SKIN BECAUSE I USE THIS PRODUCT, I BELIEVE IT IS FROM USING THIS PRODUCT.. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I have been using for years now and believe it has gone far beyond my expectations of moisturizing my skin and keeping me from having any dry, cracking and peeling skin for years now. Never felt better about picture taking and not stressing when my next severe rash will happen.  I do have very sensitive face skin so most important to get a product with no irritants. And I believe I have found it. Especially without clogging pores. AWEOMENESS!!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with dry and cracked heels most of my life.  I have tried multiple products.  Followed directions but never saw any long-term success.  I bought Aquaphor because I saw it on Dr. Oz.  It has been the only product that has actually took away heel calluses and worked on my cracked heels.  I wake up in the morning to smooth skin on my feet and I even apply it on my hands.  What a difference.  Don&#x27;t purchase anything else but this product.  IT IS THE BEST!</li>
    <li> This is a must, first heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and decided to try... Great! The downside for me is greasy factor I use at night.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for skin hydration, for scares,  etc...</li>
    <li> A very good healing treatment! I have had raggedy cuticles before but after using this product my cuticles are perfect. I also have had very rough elbows from using the computer and now the pain is gone and my elbows are much smoother.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that heals my chronic eczema. When I had a particularly severe case of eczema last year, a dermatologist prescribed a strong steroid cream that would work for a few days but when I stopped using it the eczema would come back, and sometimes worse than it initially was! And since steroids have damaging effects over long-term use, I was unwilling to become dependent on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used Aquaphor on my skin before and was wary reading about how some people react to it. But one night when my skin felt particularly raw and itchy I figured, what the hell let&#x27;s try this, and if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll pay for it in the morning. To my GREAT surprise, the patches I applied it to were immediately soothed, and by morning NOTICEABLY better! I was amazed. I applied it to the rest of my eczema and it was all noticeably better the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of several weeks my eczema began disappearing. Now I only need to use it occasionally, usually when I eat something spicy or haven&#x27;t been getting enough sleep. But my eczema is no longer severe, it&#x27;s minor &#x27;itchy skin&#x27; now. It&#x27;s gone from something that had been affecting my daily life, to a minor annoyance that is easy to deal with. I cannot overstate how priceless that is. I will always have a bottle of Aquaphor now on hand just in case! This is amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I also made lifestyle changes too. I eat healthier (and everyone is different, which is what makes eczema treatment so annoying), for me avoiding rice helps my skin enormously, and sleeping earlier makes a tremendous difference. But I had been doing those things before trying Aquaphor and the eczema kept coming back; it was only when I used the Aquaphor that the eczema began disappearing and not returning. After I using the Aquaphor for a while, other things that helped a lot are a Vitamin D supplement (liquid not capsule, which had no improvement) and coconut oil together, a hemp oil supplement, and finally the inclusion of butter into my diet helped a ton too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I should probably add is when my eczema was really severe, I used bentonite clay - that worked really well. Applying the clay is a hassle, but it helped my eczema so much when nothing was working, not even steroid creams. So after I had used the bentonite clay for a while and my eczema improved, that was when I started using the Aquaphor and then my skin cleared up. But if you have really severe eczema and nothing seems to be working, try bentonite clay (I used the Redmond Clay brand) for a while and then try another treatment, the clay seems to help fix messed up skin so other treatments can work better (that&#x27;s my theory, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I love Aquaphor and am so so thankful they make this and we can obtain it so easily, and it&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon than buying it at the store, so thank you thank you for a wonderful product!!inclusion of butter into my diet helped a ton too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I should probably add is when my eczema was really severe, I used bentonite clay - that worked really well.

    <li> This stuff is worthless.  If you like to spread yucky petrolatum jelly all over your bod, this is the stuff to get.  We haven&#x27;t been able to discern any &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; properties, and it&#x27;s certainly not &amp;#34;therapy.&amp;#34;  This is called creative advertising of a yucky product with no &amp;#34;redeeming social value.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My husband loves this for his cracked hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy because my children have allergies and eczema, I tried other things but I always come back to this product. It works well on their skin. For me it outlasts anything else that I have tried on my children. I am truly satisfied with this product, it is expensive but it&#x27;s woth the money.</li>
    <li> This product sooths the skin and keeps it moist so that the healing process can be accomplished. Easy to spread on, stays on for a long time..glad that it was recomended from amazon</li>
    <li> I love this ointment. We have been putting it on all the scratches and rashes and all other skin issues for our little one. It works wonders.</li>
    <li> I love it, I always use it after I get out the shower all over my body my boyfriend always complements me on how smooth my skin feels. It really does make your skin feel smooth like a babies, I would recommend everybody buy this if they have rough/dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have terrible dry skin. I mean REALLY bad. To the point that my feet crack and split open, making it almost impossible to walk anywhere with. My hands do the same. I had tried every lotion I have ever seen in a grocery store, but nothing worked. I went to a doctor some years ago and he said that Aquaphor was the best tool to fight dry skin. I was reluctant to pick it up based on the price, but eventually, I did and WOW. Within just a day or two, my skin was renewed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since, I have been buying it in stores at full price, but I decided to hop on amazon and see what deals there were and I got TWO tubs for the price of one. On top of that, i placed my order on a saturday afternoon, and received it from halfway across the country on monday. They estimated shipping would take 5-8 business days, but it shipped out on a sunday, and arrived next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now THAT is awesome. I will be buying all of my Aquaphor here from now on. Great product and great service!</li>
    <li> Originally bought this as diaper rash cream. It is amazing as that! The best by far! But it is also a great lip balm, chapped nose cream, and body balm for any dry area! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best size and for the price (which is expensive anywhere you go).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started using Aquaphor on our son for his eczema at the recommendation of our pediatrician. I&#x27;m inclined to try more natural products first, which I did, but after nothing seemed to be working, I decided to try this out. We started using it 3 times a day. It is very thick and keeps the skin very moisturized. It&#x27;s a little greasy and gets on clothes easily, but that&#x27;s the price you pay for a product that doesn&#x27;t absorb in the skin (most moisturizers contain alcohol and dry out the skin). It has not been a cure for my son&#x27;s eczema, that is a constant battle that we are still working on, but it does keep his skin moisturized which keeps the eczema under control. I would recommend it to anyone suffering from very dry skin or eczema. Best I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to use plain vaseline instead of Aquaphor, but Aquapor works better and isn&#x27;t quite as greasy as vaseline.</li>
    <li> My daughter has pretty bad eczema, but you would never know it. We put Aquaphor on her after every shower / bath, and anytime her skin seems to be getting a little dry. When her eczema is affecting her skin, we put it on her a little more often and everything clears up in a few days. We wen&#x27;t through a lot of different creams and moisturizers, and there was a lot of trial and error, but in 5 years we haven&#x27;t found anything that works better than Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> The best product out there. I&#x27;ve ordered it at least 3 times already. Will be coming for more! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great product.  I put it on minor cuts and sores which aids in the healing.  I also put it on my feet which softens cracked and dry skin.</li>
    <li> This definitely does heal and moisturize the skin.  It can be too greasy of used excessively.  Very similar to Vaseline but has a few more ingredients.</li>
    <li> excellent product, product works immediately after 1st application, helps keeps skin moist and soft with out daily use, we love it</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my dry heels--saw it mentioned on Dr. Oz who said it was good for that.  In only one application,overnight with socks on, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!  I have tried many other products, nothing compares! Soft, smooth feet fit for summer sandels.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my German Shepherds very dry, cracked nose.  I also have used other things the vet recommended, with no luck.  I figured if it was OK for a baby, I&#x27;d try it on him.  What a miracle!  After just one application--soft,smooth snout!  Healed up great after a couple of applications.  Can&#x27;t wait to tell my vet!</li>
