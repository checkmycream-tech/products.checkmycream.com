      <li>Good price, great packaging and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Just a hint if you aren&#x27;t sure your loved one souls like this, Amazon sells an Aramis gift set with 6 of Aramis&#x27; top fragrances.</li>

      <li>This has been my father&#x27;s preferred brand for many years</li>
      <li>This is an awesome scent from back in the days where men smelt like men and women smelt like flowers - unlike today where most men fragrances smell like you borrowed them from your sister.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite fragrance for decades.  </li>
      <li>It is OUTSTANDING.  </li>
      <li>I bought 2 and love it..</li>
      <li>I love JHL by Aramis.</li>
      <li>The original JHL was - by far - the best &amp;#34;mass-produced&amp;#34; (under $150)</li>
      <li>just man enough and unique too...  perfect for that guy who yerns for the 80&#x27;s..  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb and say that FANS WOULD PAY SUBSTANTIALLY MORE for the original formulation.</li>
      <li>it is still there (not as strong)</li>
      <li>I was given this cologne for a present in 1988, and i remember then it was great.</li>
      <li>Get the JHL he is worth it!</li>
      <li>Estée Lauder some years ago formulated this special blend for her husband John Lauder - JHL.</li>
      <li>A 3.4 oz bottle of the eau de cologne is about $60.00 and well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have not had this since high school!!  </li>
      <li>JHL is a strong smell and usually last all day.</li>
      <li>I discovered it at age 25 or so, and used it (exclusively and carefully - it was very potent; a little dab under the shirt would do ya ALL DAY) for many years.</li>
      <li>How I wish they would revert back to the original formula . . .</li>
      <li>the original did - I still have a couple of original bottles), but it does NOT &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; the same - or last nearly as long - as the original, for reasons already discussed.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty much the same in the bottle (which does not have that copper bottom</li>
      <li>It was as I remembered when purchasing at Saks, New York in the 1980s and 90s.</li>
      <li>Old school cologne - manly!</li>
      <li>a little spritz goes a long way and people often ask me what is that clean fresh smell you are wearing?</li>
      <li>I have some of the old bottles stashed away, and the new bottles shown here have only a spray.  </li>
      <li>It actually had that &amp;#34;walking a cute dog&amp;#34; effect - women (on the street, sales clerks, etc.) would LITERALLY stop me and ask what it was (guys, if that&#x27;s not a good enough reason for you, just buy any old cologne).</li>
      <li>Sadly, as the ingredients in fine fragrances became more and more expensive, a LOT of top-of-the-line fragrances (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) were &amp;#34;reformulated&amp;#34; with cheaper ingredients (or less musk oil, etc.).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now becoming very hard to find.  </li>

    <li> I was given this cologne for a present in 1988, and i remember then it was great. What a manly scent. I then used it up and asked where did it come from, and could not find it at the upscale dept. stores. I did not have WWW. then. I found it at amazon.com, and I was so happy I order it immediately. Again, very manly scent, just need a little it last a long time. Lots of complements. It makes you feel very good.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome scent from back in the days where men smelt like men and women smelt like flowers - unlike today where most men fragrances smell like you borrowed them from your sister. Buy this. Smell awesome! Smell like a man!</li>
    <li> I lo v e this cologne.  Fall and winter!  Perfect</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for decades.  It wasn&#x27;t produced for some years, but I had some in reserve!  But, as I was at the &amp;#34;bottom of the barrel&amp;#34; I found it here ... Back in production!!  Good price, great packaging and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed that it was not like the original fragrance that I had years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I have had compliments on this one though.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product as  it is described. It was as I remembered when purchasing at Saks, New York in the 1980s and 90s.</li>
    <li> Purchase was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> This bottle of JHL seems to be watered down.  By the time my husband gets to the door to leave for work after putting it on the fragrance is gone.  He has been wearing JHL since the 70&#x27;s.  JHL is a strong smell and usually last all day.</li>
    <li> A gift for my husband.</li>
    <li> I have been using JHL for 20 years.  It&#x27;s now becoming very hard to find.  I have some of the old bottles stashed away, and the new bottles shown here have only a spray.  Still an excellent product for those of us that love the cologne.</li>
    <li> Estée Lauder some years ago formulated this special blend for her husband John Lauder - JHL. A 3.4 oz bottle of the eau de cologne is about $60.00 and well worth the money. a little spritz goes a long way and people often ask me what is that clean fresh smell you are wearing? JHL is now made by Aramis. Just a hint if you aren&#x27;t sure your loved one souls like this, Amazon sells an Aramis gift set with 6 of Aramis&#x27; top fragrances. Great stocking stuffer or. Introductory gift. Get the JHL he is worth it!</li>
    <li> This has been my husbands favorite for ove 10 years he loves the smaell and is always getting complements on it.</li>
    <li> The best fragrance, nothing better. This has been my father&#x27;s preferred brand for many years and I will always remember it.</li>
    <li> The original JHL was - by far - the best &amp;#34;mass-produced&amp;#34; (under $150) men&#x27;s fragrance EVER. Period. I discovered it at age 25 or so, and used it (exclusively and carefully - it was very potent; a little dab under the shirt would do ya ALL DAY) for many years. It actually had that &amp;#34;walking a cute dog&amp;#34; effect - women (on the street, sales clerks, etc.) would LITERALLY stop me and ask what it was (guys, if that&#x27;s not a good enough reason for you, just buy any old cologne). Sadly, as the ingredients in fine fragrances became more and more expensive, a LOT of top-of-the-line fragrances (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) were &amp;#34;reformulated&amp;#34; with cheaper ingredients (or less musk oil, etc.). Unfortunately, those expensive ingredients are what made the original fragrances complex, adaptable, memorable, and long-lasting. So . . . you can imagine my disappointment in this &amp;#34;reformulation&amp;#34; of JHL. It smells pretty much the same in the bottle (which does not have that copper bottom the original did - I still have a couple of original bottles), but it does NOT &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; the same - or last nearly as long - as the original, for reasons already discussed. How I wish they would revert back to the original formula . . . I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb and say that FANS WOULD PAY SUBSTANTIALLY MORE for the original formulation.</li>
    <li> I have not had this since high school!!  The scent (I put it on just after work around 5pm) and now.. 12am it is still there (not as strong) but I can smell it.. Awesome scent, not flowery not powdery.... just man enough and unique too...  perfect for that guy who yerns for the 80&#x27;s..  I bought 2 and love it.. you might too</li>
    <li> I just adore this on my hubby.  I&#x27;m So happy we were able to find it here.  LOVE IT !!!</li>
    <li> Old school cologne - manly!</li>
    <li> I love JHL by Aramis. It smells great on my husband.</li>
    <li> It is OUTSTANDING.  I ONLY HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO CARRY THE PRODUCT.</li>
