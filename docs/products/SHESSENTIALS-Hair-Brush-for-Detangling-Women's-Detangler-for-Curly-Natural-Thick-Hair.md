### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Thank you Amazon for your awesome return policy!</li>
      <li>I think if the bristles were longer and a bit stronger this would be perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>Truly a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>It works great with a spray on conditioner like</li>
      <li>Works great when her hair is all tangled.</li>
      <li>But nonetheless a great detangling brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m  also happy with a handle that works effectually.</li>
      <li>The brush is a good size to carry in a purse also.</li>
      <li>I wished my hair brush was that good</li>
      <li>Love this brush!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Goody tangle free brush and it works great, but the bristles fall out after a while.  </li>
      <li>Simply put this brush is great for knots and tangles and is the best brush I have ever used for my daughter.</li>
      <li>and it tangles very easily.</li>
      <li>and this is one of them that gets it right and is great for her hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>more hair in the comb than I recall</li>
      <li>maybe I&#x27;d like this more.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I have to confess that  </li>
      <li>She said I should buy one:)</li>
      <li>The granddaughters love it however it is not a miracle worker.  </li>
      <li>It is much better a brushing through my tangled hair than any brush I have ever used before.</li>
      <li>there is probably something better for the Sam amount of money.</li>
      <li>do still LOVE this brush and want one for myself.  </li>
      <li>I found this brush does better with my son&#x27;s straight/thin hair than my daughter&#x27;s curly/thick hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that it is very effective at dealing with my tangles, while still being gentle on my fine</li>
      <li>Also received it very quickly.</li>
      <li>The problem is that the bristles are plastic and they break off easily.</li>
      <li>The bristles are like plastic toothpicks that easily break off with each use.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that tangles really easily</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it</li>
      <li>The wash-in affords additional body, but my hair is still fine.  </li>
      <li>It is cute and super functional.</li>
      <li>huge let</li>
      <li>--Huge</li>
      <li>This brush is a cheap plastic piece of garbage.</li>
      <li>Thought this brush was great for a day or two but the bristles just constantly break off.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think the overall quality is  that great.</li>
      <li>BUT OVERALL GREAT PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I use this brush several times a day because it flows through my hair easily and feels good on my scalp.</li>
      <li>Maybe this brush is a knock-off and not an original product???  </li>
      <li>It works great on wet hair without pulling or breaking my hair.</li>
      <li>I would struggle with what to do with my mop of wet hair post-showering, and this is a great solution to that dilemma.</li>
      <li>I just ordered a Wet Brush to add to our tangle arsenal, but am still happy I bought this one and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this brush because the shape and different lengths of bristles give a great massage to the scalp.</li>
      <li>As for the way it untangles, the brush was by no means extraordinary.  </li>
      <li>Luckily this thing has a &amp;#34;life-time warranty&amp;#34;, but damn.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Teeth&amp;#34; break the very first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Does work better than a normal brush but still pulls.</li>
      <li>The bristles broke off on the very first use.</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t make a difference in a an 8 year old fine but frizzy and easily tangled hair.</li>
      <li>This SHESSENTIALS detangling brush got such great reviews I thought I found my new brush.  </li>
      <li>, you decide that&#x27;s worth $15 for you.</li>
      <li>So take it for what it&#x27;s worth for $15</li>
      <li>I have a full head of fine, naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>and it breezes right through with no pulling.  </li>
      <li>Return it right away.</li>
      <li>I  bought this brush for my 3 yr old who has fine hair that curls at the end.</li>
      <li>Several of the bristles broke upon first use - and I have fine hair!  </li>
      <li>Maybe another similar brush is more durable.</li>
      <li>This brush only goes through the top layer so in order to brush your hair throughoutly you have to do it in layers.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with a full head of curly hair, but it&#x27;s probably good for a child that has less hair or just anyone in general that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair to brush through.  </li>
      <li>and it seems to work better than when my hair is dry.</li>
      <li>Really hoped this could be my answer</li>
      <li>My daughter loves using the brush on my grandbaby.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very jealous.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The trick to using this brush is to start with the very ends of your hair, and work your way upwards.</li>
      <li>I absolutely loves this because it glides threw my hair perfectly🙌</li>
      <li>My daughter has curly hair and was really looking forward to this brush.</li>
      <li>This really helped to detangle my hair.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t a miracle like they show on tv with those detangling brushes that glide effortlessly through hair from scalp to tip without a snag, but I&#x27;d still recommend this as it did help so much.</li>
      <li>I use it after showering, and I&#x27;m not pulling out as much hair anymore.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s pink, which is her favorite color.</li>
      <li>However, while I have a lot of hair, it is very fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>Also it was able to tackle a dry hair tangle, that I normally would have had to brush in three sections using detangler spray on each section, with ease.&lt;br</li>
      <li>only  thing going for this brush is it&#x27;s unique form</li>
      <li>It does detangle and leave my hair pretty smooth and not as frizzy as my other brushes.</li>
      <li>Great brush, takes out less hair than any other brush you may have.</li>
      <li>The bristles were not as strong as I thought they would be and it did nothing to detangle my hair, even when my hair was wet and easier to manage.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical of this product, but it is a very unique brush which is very gentle for fine hair.</li>
      <li>I would also highly recommend it for kids who struggle with getting the knots out of their hair.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make brushing tangled hair any easier than a normal brush.</li>
      <li>I had to go over the tangled hair again with my normal walmart brush.  </li>
      <li>so I went through several brushes for her till I go it right</li>
      <li>Shouldn&#x27;t be needing a new one after a month of using it.</li>
      <li>Brakes easy but does work not worth the price!</li>
      <li>the only tiff i have, is that the handle could have been a little longer for better grip.</li>
      <li>I noticed that in many of the negative reviews there were complaints about the bristles breaking.  </li>
      <li>While Shessentials has soft bristles</li>
      <li>This 100% money back brush absolutely fell apart within a couple of days.  </li>
      <li>I like this hair brush very much, My old brush use to take a lot of my hair out</li>
      <li>Lately there&#x27;s been more tugging when I would pass the wide-toothed comb through my hair...and TO MY HORROR ....</li>
      <li>The brush works very well, and is very gentle on my scared little rescue dog.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m older now and using a wash-in to cover the gray in my overall still auburn hair.  </li>
      <li>Very fine, very thick toddler hair still needs work to detangle without tears.  </li>
      <li>I COULD REALLY TELL IF I HAD LONG HAIR.</li>
      <li>I also bought one for my granddaughter who has long hair and is very tender headed.</li>
      <li>Use gentle, soft strokes, and continue working carefully over the tangled section.</li>
      <li>one major problem is that the bristles keep falling off.</li>
      <li>I have long straight and thick but smooth hair that gets tangled with extended wind gust exposure.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> &amp;#34;Teeth&amp;#34; break the very first time I used it. Return it right away. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The granddaughters love it however it is not a miracle worker.  Very fine, very thick toddler hair still needs work to detangle without tears.  As a bonus, this brush came with a little mini popup brush that I put in the car for those last minute touchups.</li>
    <li> If I had less hair maybe I&#x27;d like this more.  I have a full head of fine, naturally curly hair.  I&#x27;ve been using my Goody brush for the past 10 or so years and have been looking to update/replace it.  This SHESSENTIALS detangling brush got such great reviews I thought I found my new brush.  Not so.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and already one of the bristles has broken off.  I think if the bristles were longer and a bit stronger this would be perfect for me.  I can&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with a full head of curly hair, but it&#x27;s probably good for a child that has less hair or just anyone in general that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair to brush through.  I have had to section my hair just to get this brush through it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t make a difference in a an 8 year old fine but frizzy and easily tangled hair. The bristles are too short so it doesn&#x27;t go deep. It just brushes the surface.</li>
    <li> I was sooooo disappointed with this product. Both myself and my daughter have crazy hair that is hard to brush through even wet. When I read the reviews for this I thought I had found a saving grace! I was wrong!!!!! This brush only goes through the top layer so in order to brush your hair throughoutly you have to do it in layers.  If you have long hair this means you are taking forever just to brush your hair and even then it is not brushed well. I do not recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my little grandaughter, she has lone fine hair that tangles so bad. Her mother used this on her and it didn&#x27;t hurt.  Now she won&#x27;t use any orther brush.  Also received it very quickly.</li>
    <li> Before using this brush, it took at least 20 minutes to detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair after a bath. Now it takes less than a minute! Love this brush! And it&#x27;s pink, which is her favorite color.</li>
    <li> I like the brush. I have fine hair, but a lot of it and it tangles very easily. It does detangle and leave my hair pretty smooth and not as frizzy as my other brushes. The main thing i really have as a complaint is that after a week or so of owning it one of the bristels broke. Hoping that no more do.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT BUT MY HAIR IS SHORT I COULD REALLY TELL IF I HAD LONG HAIR. BUT OVERALL GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Not very good quality, the brush teeth keep breaking.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush based on good reviews, but was thoroughly disappointed when it arrived--the bristles on this brush were way shorter and WEAKER than a detangling bursh should be.  I have long straight and thick but smooth hair that gets tangled with extended wind gust exposure.  Really hoped this could be my answer bc the walmart brushes were just so &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34;.... But when I tried this brush, the bristles on this brush barely even touches the inner-most layer of my hair, &amp; that&#x27;s before it is even tangled. I had to go over the tangled hair again with my normal walmart brush.  --Huge huge let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only  thing going for this brush is it&#x27;s unique form, you decide that&#x27;s worth $15 for you.</li>
    <li> I received the brush and it works well to detangle my hair. I like that is has a guarantee. Other brush have a hard bristle and it hurts my scalp. While Shessentials has soft bristles so it those not scratch my scalp.</li>
    <li> The brush dangled my natural African American hair well. As a lefty, it did not feel comfortable in my hands and using the brush felt awkward, like a bad grip. I went back to my Denman brush.</li>
    <li> Simply put this brush is great for knots and tangles and is the best brush I have ever used for my daughter. she has long hair and I have several brushes for her. I am a single father so I went through several brushes for her till I go it right and this is one of them that gets it right and is great for her hair. If you have kids I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product, but it is a very unique brush which is very gentle for fine hair. I&#x27;m  also happy with a handle that works effectually. I&#x27;d recommend it to any hair type.</li>
    <li> The only brush my 4 year old monster- I mean daughter, does not run away from. Amaze-balls, where has this been all my life?</li>
    <li> I do adore this brush. I use it after showering when my hair is wet and at other times when it is dry too. I would struggle with what to do with my mop of wet hair post-showering, and this is a great solution to that dilemma. I would also highly recommend it for kids who struggle with getting the knots out of their hair. It is cute and super functional.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using the brush on my grandbaby.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very jealous.  I wished my hair brush was that good</li>
    <li> Great brush, takes out less hair than any other brush you may have. I use it to detangle my thick curly hair when its damp and it is one product that truly does what it says. the only tiff i have, is that the handle could have been a little longer for better grip. But nonetheless a great detangling brush.</li>
    <li> This brush works by getting out the knots with little effort, however the handle is too short for my liking. It makes it difficult to hold onto. I usually use it after shampooing  and it seems to work better than when my hair is dry. So take it for what it&#x27;s worth for $15 I spent on it there is probably something better for the Sam amount of money.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific detangler!  JUST received it yesterday, used it this morning, wet hair....and worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am something of a rarity, a for-real-redhead.  However, while I have a lot of hair, it is very fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;m older now and using a wash-in to cover the gray in my overall still auburn hair.  The wash-in affords additional body, but my hair is still fine.  Lately there&#x27;s been more tugging when I would pass the wide-toothed comb through my hair...and TO MY HORROR ....more hair in the comb than I recall before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, its rather like turning on the television, I have no idea how it works, but it works/  Truly a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loves this because it glides threw my hair perfectly🙌</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for about a week. I have fine hair that tangles really easily It is much better a brushing through my tangled hair than any brush I have ever used before. It works great on wet hair without pulling or breaking my hair. Also it was able to tackle a dry hair tangle, that I normally would have had to brush in three sections using detangler spray on each section, with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one major problem is that the bristles keep falling off. I have only had the brush for a little over a week and already 16 bristles have broken off. At least one seems to break of with each use. If the brush continues to break at this rate it will be unusable.</li>
    <li> I am actually loosing MUCH LESS hair that with any other regular brush I&#x27;ve ever used/owned!</li>
    <li> My daughter has super thick curly hair and my son has super thin straight hair. Both get crazy amounts of knots from sleeping and sitting in their car seats. I found this brush does better with my son&#x27;s straight/thin hair than my daughter&#x27;s curly/thick hair.</li>
    <li> This comb has poor quality. I have only used it for 2 days and now many teeth are broken and falling off. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> The bristles broke off on the very first use. Made of the cheapest plastic. It didn&#x27;t make brushing tangled hair any easier than a normal brush. Threw this in the trash within a week.</li>
    <li> I ordered the brush based on the reviews but was disappointed when it arrived.  The bristles were not as strong as I thought they would be and it did nothing to detangle my hair, even when my hair was wet and easier to manage.  Not the brush for all hair types so I returned it,</li>
    <li> I have short hair and don&#x27;t usually have any tangles. I really like this brush because the shape and different lengths of bristles give a great massage to the scalp. The brush is a good size to carry in a purse also. I use this brush several times a day because it flows through my hair easily and feels good on my scalp. I also bought one for my granddaughter who has long hair and is very tender headed. The brush is a hugh improvement over other brushes she has used.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this brush. Works great when her hair is all tangled. No more pain when brushing.</li>
    <li> This 100% money back brush absolutely fell apart within a couple of days.  I have very fine hair and it&#x27;s also very long, so it tangles at the hint of a breeze.  I&#x27;ve used the Goody tangle free brush and it works great, but the bristles fall out after a while.  However, the Goody brush is 1/3 the price of this brush and lasts way longer.  Maybe this brush is a knock-off and not an original product???  Whatever the case, I am returning it and getting another Goody brush.</li>
    <li> This brush does what it says. It detangles well.  The problem is that the bristles are plastic and they break off easily. I don&#x27;t consider myself hard on things. But just everyday use is causing it to break down.  I won&#x27;t buy this brand again. Maybe another similar brush is more durable.</li>
    <li> Works well but the teeth have started to break within a week of its use.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. The worst brush ever. 6 days and teeth are falling already</li>
    <li> Within two uses of this brush (on hair that wasn&#x27;t really tangled, just wet), 7 bristles fell out.  Four uses later, another dozen.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It brushes thru and untangles my hair BUT  after just three days over 12 brush prongs are broken off.  I have super thin hair,  so I expected it to not break.  I am disappointed.  It had lots of great reviews, and I hoped it would be a long lasting brush:  not at this rate :(</li>
    <li> Thought this brush was great for a day or two but the bristles just constantly break off.  It&#x27;s the worst of the detangling brushes.  Thank you Amazon for your awesome return policy!</li>
    <li> Alright so, the average review here is four stars. And I don&#x27;t know how, but I&#x27;ll just assume I am the outlier for now. The brush definitely detangles, but not without breaking while in the process of doing the detangling. The little prongs have been breaking off in my hair. I have very basic hair, it&#x27;s nothing too absurd. It&#x27;s thicker, typical wavy to curly hair. It&#x27;s not obscenely curly or thick. But as I brush it through my hair, the little prongs bend back and fall off. Luckily this thing has a &amp;#34;life-time warranty&amp;#34;, but damn. Shouldn&#x27;t be needing a new one after a month of using it.</li>
    <li> A lot of the teeth are out after two uses.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this brush!! The little sticksibside have broken on the first time i used it.. And my hair was driend and detangled !</li>
    <li> This brush is a cheap plastic piece of garbage. The bristles are like plastic toothpicks that easily break off with each use. I  bought this brush for my 3 yr old who has fine hair that curls at the end. I trashed the brush after 3 uses because I got tired of picking up pieces of black plastic bristles. As for the way it untangles, the brush was by no means extraordinary.  Strongly DO NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have to confess that  I bought this brush specifically for my small dog who has very soft wavy hair.  The brush works very well, and is very gentle on my scared little rescue dog.  He actually allows me to brush him.  But after using only a few times, I have noticed that some of the teeth have fallen out.  I would understand this if he was extremely wiry, or had a heavy undercoat, but he does not.  Overall, I like it, and I know it&#x27;s not designed for dogs,  but I don&#x27;t think the overall quality is  that great.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for my hair. I couldnt even get the bristles through.</li>
    <li> I like this hair brush very much, My old brush use to take a lot of my hair out and I have very thin hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this with my granddaughters, who have thick, curly hair, in mind.  There have been a lot less tears and arguing when getting ready in the morning! Would definitely recommend this brush for parents.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother on Mother&#x27;s Day. She loves it! It glides through her hair, despite her wavy, thick hair grade. She said I should buy one:)</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my 3 year old granddaughter who absolutely hates having her hair brushed and has long (24 inches), fine, somewhat curly hair that tangles like mad.  It works great with a spray on conditioner like L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCreme Nourishing Leave-In Spray or AG Conditioning Mist Detangling Conditioner ~ IF the tangles don&#x27;t get out of hand.  Unfortunately my granddaughter got a big tangle that we couldn&#x27;t get out with this brush or any others we had.  A relative used the Wet Brush that she&#x27;d gotten for her granddaughter who has very similar hair (and tangles &amp; tender head) and got the tangle/mat out completely without any crying or fit throwing ~ just a few \\&quot;ouch\\&quot;es.  I&#x27;d been worried we&#x27;d actually have to cut her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still LOVE this brush and want one for myself.  I have straight, very thick, past shoulder length hair and it breezes right through with no pulling.  I just ordered a Wet Brush to add to our tangle arsenal, but am still happy I bought this one and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, this brush does come with a guarantee ~ \\&quot;100% Satisfaction Money Back Guarantee. You Break It, We Replace It!\\&quot;.  I noticed that in many of the negative reviews there were complaints about the bristles breaking.  The one I bought has been in constant use since May 2014 and still has all the bristles.</li>
    <li> I was amazed that this brush detangled my hair so well. Having thinning hair that falls out at the drop of a hat is bad enough, pulling out hair trying to comb it out was the worst! This really helped to detangle my hair. It wasn&#x27;t a miracle like they show on tv with those detangling brushes that glide effortlessly through hair from scalp to tip without a snag, but I&#x27;d still recommend this as it did help so much. I use it after showering, and I&#x27;m not pulling out as much hair anymore.</li>
    <li> As well made as the more expensive versions.  A must got a daughter with waist-length hair.</li>
    <li> Several of the bristles broke upon first use - and I have fine hair!  Sent this back immediately.</li>
    <li> I have waist-length hair that fine, thin, straight, and is extremely prone to tangling. I have tried numerous brushes, and was skeptical about the claims that I&#x27;ve read regarding this brush. I&#x27;ve found that it is very effective at dealing with my tangles, while still being gentle on my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to using this brush is to start with the very ends of your hair, and work your way upwards. Use gentle, soft strokes, and continue working carefully over the tangled section. This brush has always gracefully helped me through the knots and tangles that I obtain every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to purchase a second brush so that I can keep it with me at all times!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I would have hoped.  Does work better than a normal brush but still pulls.</li>
    <li> Brakes easy but does work not worth the price!</li>
    <li> Wont go through my daughter thick hair</li>
    <li> Yes product does not cause pain when brushing ... But the bristles on brush break lol so there hardly any brush left by day 5! My daughter has curly hair and was really looking forward to this brush. It is less painful than normal brushes. That&#x27;s why it gets a 3 but made poorly.</li>
    <li> The ends are very fragile</li>
