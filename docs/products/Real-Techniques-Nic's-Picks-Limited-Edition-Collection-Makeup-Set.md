<li> I have a heavy hand sometimes.  </li>

    <li> Very soft, and they do the job!</li>
    <li> I love this set and wish I would have purchased two. It&#x27;s a limited edition set of five truly wonderful brushes.

    <li> Fantastic brushes! Love the feel and the way the blend and apply. Great shipping.</li>
    <li> I am a brush junkie. I really like duofiber brushes for light application.  I have a heavy hand sometimes.  My favorite in this set is the angled shadow brush.  It&#x27;s good for blending.</li>
    <li> I recieved a pink set instead of the silver one&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that no option was there to choose from&lt;br /&gt;I was disapponted to recieve a color which dosnt resembel the display pucture and im wondering wether its genuion or not</li>
    <li> I really like this set, especially the brow brush, but the powder brush is useless. If you are buying with emphasis on the powder brush, I would go with a different set. If you need a basic variety of eye brushes, then it is great, with a bonus nice blush brush.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. I have had real techniques brushes before and liked them but these just feel cheap.</li>
    <li> Love this brush set! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I really love this set ! Sometimes when you buy this kind of set you just use some of the brushes, but in this one, I have a real use for every brush ! These brushes are very soft and perfect to apply any type of makeup. As a beauty blogger, I can be very picky with the quality and here, I&#x27;m totally satisfied ! I washed them several times and never had a bristle down ! Love it !</li>
    <li> My daughter had these on her wish list. They were sold out everywhere else I looked. Was glad to find them here, and at a great price. She adores these makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for the price</li>
    <li> Playing with make-up and using different techniques and tools is fun for women of all ages. Finding new products is part of the adventure too. Even big girls like me get so excited to try out the Real Techniques Nic&#x27;s Pics Limited Edition Collection Make-up Set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through a couple of nice sets of brushes in the last few years. I thought it was time to call on my niece who happens to be a cosmetologist. I needed to get some pointers on how to use these awesome brushes and keep them nice. She was happy to show me her expertise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing we noticed was how beautifully made they were. They are of good quality and very chic. They are pretty to look at and feel so soft on our skin. The name of the brush is printed on each brush which will be so much help to me when I am using them on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 5 ultra plush brushes are amazing and I like them all, but my favorite has to be the exclusive angled shadow brush. It is designed to fit the crease of the eye and add depth. I could tell the difference right away when applying the eye shadow with this brush. The dense bristles helped blend color. The eyeliner brush (also an exclusive) is softly angled for just the right applications too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first thought when I got these brushes that I would try them out and maybe give them to my niece as a gift. I thought it would be a wonderful surprise to give them to her for Christmas, but I think I am going to have to keep the brushes and order her own set online. They are just perfect for me too!
