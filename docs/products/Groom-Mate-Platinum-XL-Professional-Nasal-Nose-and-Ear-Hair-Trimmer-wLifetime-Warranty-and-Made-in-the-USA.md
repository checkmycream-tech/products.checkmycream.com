<li> It is a little awkward at first, though, so</li>

    <li> Very high-end feel and manufacturing tolerances as best I can tell; expensive but I like it.</li>
    <li> this attractive little thing succeeds in  doing what it is suppose to do.  i am proud a quality product like this is made in USA.....francis</li>

    <li> Could they?  If you even had to think about it, much less run to a mirror and check, you need this product or something similar, and with nose and ear hair trimmers you&#x27;ve got a couple of ways to go: manual or electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With electric, you&#x27;ve got a huge number of choices, including the one Hammacher Schlemmer currently rates as the best [[ASIN:B00BCGAOVQ Wahl 5546-400 Lithium Powered Lighted Detailer]].  However, electric nose hair trimmers, including the best, have three distinct disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They are noisy.&lt;br /&gt;2. They require batteries.&lt;br /&gt;3. There too large to comfortably fit in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last might be the most important to the less habitually fastidious among us because if your trimmer isn&#x27;t right there in your pocket, like your comb, you will be unable to deal with any hair emergencies that you notice in the mirror while you are out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, if you go with a manual trimmer, the next question is one handed or two.  If one handed, your choice is made; you will need something like this [[ASIN:B0001MBRYK Groom Mate Silver Wing XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]].  The chief advantage of this type is speed; you can safely trim squeezing the wing handles as fast as you can.  The obvious disadvantage about this type is that it&#x27;s a little bulkier in the pocket than the two handed barrel type; the less obvious disadvantage is that if you have two good hands, you may prefer the precision of two handed operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the two handed type you&#x27;ve got several choices:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00LBZY16W Groom Mate Classic Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]],&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000EBFJXS Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]],&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00LC201MM Groom Mate Platinum XL Plus Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]],&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00LC29EDO Groom Mate Platinum XL Professional Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the deciding factor was the \\&quot;Screw-On Stainless Steel Cap for Extra Protection\\&quot; because if you drop it and manage to damage the blades and guards, you are out of business until it is fixed, even though it will be a free repair under the lifetime guarantee.it will be a free repair under the lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> Everything it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  Gets the job done, no fuss, no muss, no pulled hairs.  Certainly not the most important grooming tool, but when you need it, this is the one.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not realize this was a manual product and my husband haes it! It pulls at hair and is very uncomfortable to use.  It was much more expensive than similar electronic versions and I wish I had realized before we bought and tried to use it!</li>
    <li> This thing works like a charm. No pinching the hairs while cutting. Very smooth!! Plus a nice little travel bag.</li>
    <li> I am one of the few that didn&#x27;t take notice of the &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; aspect of this trimmer. No battery is required. Aside from my lack of paying attention and being shocked when there was no button to make it spin or a place to put the battery it is a very well built trimmer. I have had a few issues with it pulling my hairs but that was before I realized that it is important to rotate both clockwise and counterclockwise to make it properly trim the hairs. After I got the hang of the trimmer it works quite well. Thankfully I am without any ear hair but I can see how this would be somewhat hard to use in one&#x27;s ear as it requires two hands to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is an A+ for sure. The little pack, plastic tube and brush are all great for travel. I would recommend this for someone always on the road.</li>
    <li> Incredibly compact unit! I keep it in my briefcase just in case I have a stray hair. This has a life time warranty!</li>
    <li> Well made product.  Liked it so much I ordered a second just to leave in my car.</li>
    <li> This is the cadillac of groomate trimmers. It&#x27;s rock solid and has a screw on cover to protect the blade area. The item feels rock solid and works well trimming nose hairs. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Simple to use, well made, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works well and is very compact.  Also requires no batteries, so its great to have in my travel kit.  It is a little awkward at first, though, so it takes a little getting used to holding it in place then turning the knob.</li>
    <li> Does the job just fine. Love that it takes no batteries and is small and compact. The people that gave it 2 and 3 stars because it was not motorized obviously didn&#x27;t read the description.</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate Platinum XL Professional Nasal &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer is the BEST available.  No batteries required, and the VERY EASY to use rotation at end of trimmer is super simple to use.  I am disabled with nerve damage to my dominant hand.  This is very manageable even for me, so anyone could use it effortlessly.  No lost time digging for batteries!  It removes hair from those delicate nasal passages and ears thoroughly and pain free. It is quick and simple. Then, brush the trimmer with the brush provided. It has a heavy duty top to cover and protect the blades, yet is light to hold. It also comes with a small leather-look pouch that has Velcro to secure it is closed.  Accessible for keeping in ones pocket, purse, or hygiene bag.  It comes boxed, so it is so lovely to give as a gift.  To top it off, it is MADE IN USA!  What&#x27;s not to like!  I highly recommend this for personal use or as a thoughtful gift.  I will never need another trimmer because this looks and feels built for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I travel and decided after purchasing my first groom mate that I needed one for my shaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;The tool works!  Men who have written that it is pulling their hairs out painfully are not&lt;br /&gt;allowing the trimmer to do the work.  Don&#x27;t pull the tool out of your nose or ear until&lt;br /&gt;you are done trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groom mate is very well made.  Light, easy to use, small and most importantly&lt;br /&gt;it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect gift for men of a certain age; when hair grows in places formerly unheard of!</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. The new design allows groomate trimmer to get a better and a closer trim of hair. It works well and cuts hair well and is a great product.</li>
    <li> This works great, I was very skeptical about something that turned manually but was more than impressed. Just a few turns and this thing can cut you don&#x27;t even know it. My previous would pull and not cut as good for sure. Very handy design, travels easy, just a great overall product and will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I gave this trimmer to my husband as a replacement for his old battery operated trimmer. He was skeptical when he saw how small it was and found that it was manual, but now he says it&#x27;s the best trimmer he&#x27;s ever used!</li>
    <li> Got this for hubby and at first it is somewhat awkward to use.  When you get the knack of using it, works well.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the quality of this item and the craftmanship.  It might be ideal for travelers too who don&#x27;t want to pack batteries.  Packaging was great, includes a case and small brush and they added in a complimentary pen as well.  If you had to find something to complain about, I guess it might be the weight since it&#x27;s stainless steel but that&#x27;s not an issue for me.  Some have mentioned the coordination required to twist the bottom portion but you&#x27;ll get use to it after a few moments I believe.  It&#x27;s safer than a larger powered trimmer, takes up less room, easier to clean, requires no cords or batteries and is made in the USA.</li>
    <li> The product rocks and I have had them replace an older one I had that I broke due to my own negligence. I even told them how I did it and why it was my fault. Hard to beat that.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I got this package, as I could tell is was a high quality device.  I&#x27;m sick and tired of flimsy trimmers made in China.  This one is made in the USA and is a heavy high-quality item.  Then I went to turn it on...  It is a manual trimmer!!!  I find it impossible to trim my ear hair and the first pass up my nose yanked out a hair.  Ouch.  You need two hands to work the thing, so going inside the ear is just not going to work.</li>
