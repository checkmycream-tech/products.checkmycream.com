<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these toothbrushes! My kids love them too and it makes brushing so much easier than traditional kids/baby toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too big for my 2 year old</li>
    <li> Packaging is not very good, a bit squashed</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. The bristles are nice and soft and I actually feel like I&#x27;m cleaning his teeth of all the foods he ate.</li>
    <li> These  are really nice brushes. Head is a good size for a toddler. My son loves these because they look like small&lt;br /&gt;Adult brushes. Plastic handle is sturdy and wide. I have not had any issues with bristles falling out, which I have had woh other brushes</li>
    <li> we love our toothbrushes, perfect practice for little teeth!</li>
    <li> Nice colors but the bristles wear out fast.</li>
    <li> I was looking for toothbrushes that were not made in China and this one is great.  I got the 3-pack for the price since my son tends to chew them up anyway.  We use non-flouridated toothpaste by Earth&#x27;s Best (made with safe xylitol).</li>
    <li> it is good for small kids, my son is 3 years old, and it is too soft, better for kids under 2 Y</li>
    <li> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;  [bbe]  And God, looking on the light, saw that it was good: and God made a division between the light and the dark,</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used RADIUS toothbrushes since my daughter sprouted her first tooth-the bristles are soft and do not seem to bother her sensitive gums when she is teething. I like that the brush head is not too small (as a lot of baby toothbrushes are)because I can cover more surface area with one swipe than I would otherwise. This can be advantageous when you&#x27;re dealing with a squirmy toddler. I will continue to use the radius brushes over other brands.</li>
    <li> I used the baby version of these with my soon and never had any problems. Now that he is older I switched to these ones. No problems so far. Easy for me and him to hold, fits well in his mouth, and no issues with lose bristles. did end up with a purple one in our assortment, do if you have a boy that could be a factor, but he&#x27;s just brushing his grub so that was fine for us.</li>
    <li> i use these for my dogs, fantastic</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, like the rounded shape and wide handles.</li>
    <li> I Love these toothbrushes!! I buy the Radius toothbrushes for myself and was very happy to find them sized for my daughter, too. The bristles are soft but do a very thorough job removing plaque. And the bright sparkly colors are adorable :) They also last longer than other toothbrushes - I change them out at 6 months although they are still in good shape at that point. It&#x27;s very nice to get them in a set of three because one order lasts me for a hear and a half :) Would recommend to anyone to try these!</li>
    <li> My 2 year old son likes it. But like other kinds of kids toothbrush it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few weeks since he likes to chew on the brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 19 months and teething terribly. She prefers this toothbrush over all others. We purchased a bunch of them so that we don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> My lil one loves to brush his teeth with this, so far so good. Worth the money knowing bpa free since he chews on brush</li>
    <li> The toothbrush hair very soft,  The grip is very comfortable,  and my son like it.  Every day he used it</li>
    <li> Great for my 3 year old.  Handle width is perfect and the sparkles are a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> VERY SOFT,GOOD FOR BABY</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes.  Soft bristles that hold up well, and a nice handle to hold.  I use these on my 3 &amp; 5 year olds and they both love the bright colors.</li>
    <li> baby like it, a good next step from the ones with characters on them and also cheaper</li>
    <li> My kids love these toothbrushes. They&#x27;ve been using them for a while and they do a great job of cleaning my kids teeth while still being soft. The handles are comfortable for them to hold and they are wide enough to put Mabel&#x27;s Labels name labels on them (my son and baby ended up with the same color). I&#x27;ve only purchased the three pack on amazon once, so I can&#x27;t speak to the variety of colors from pack to pack. My first pack came with green, blue, and white. My husband and I aren&#x27;t a big fan of the white, it&#x27;s a hard color to find when the toothbrush gets lost or just dropped into our white bathtub. But overall, they&#x27;re great natural bristle brushes.</li>
    <li> The WORST toothbrushes ever made.  The bristles spread apart and split at the ends after just a few uses by a 2 year old.  This happened with all three brushes.</li>
    <li> We couldn&#x27;t get our toddler to stop biting his other little toddler toothbrush.  This one has a nice wide handle and a wider brush.  It is definitely improving his teeth-brushing skills using this product.  Recommend for anyone having issues getting their toddler to use a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My LO was an early teether, so we&#x27;ve used these since ca. 12 months with consistent satisfaction.  Big head allows great coverage, do I not struggle to make sure I get each side of each tooth.  Bristles truly are soft, and they are secured in place better than regular commercial brands&#x27;, which means that even biting the brush doesn&#x27;t pull them out.  Plus, these toothbrushes are noted to be BPA-free, which is healthier for Little Chewy!</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes for my child. She likes to have her own toothbrush and they are the perfect softness with a slightly larger head than most. She even uses them to chew on when teething.</li>
    <li> The bristles frayed very quickly, after about 3 weeks of brushing once a day. The previous brand we used lasted substantially longer.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the photo on the page is a bit misleading. We expected to receive 6 toothbrushes in the package, there are only 3 (The product description is correct, it&#x27;s just that the photo doesn&#x27;t match)</li>
    <li> Just so so, my boy doesn&#x27;t like use it.</li>
    <li> Brush head is too wide for 2 years old.</li>
    <li> My daughter seems to like this toothbrush due to it multiple color offerings.  She brushes her teeth first and then we go through and brush her teeth again just to make sure they are clean.  Do we struggle with brushing her teeth?  Yes, sometime still but not all children like to brush their teeth.  I do know she prefers this one to the free kid toothbrush we got from the dentist.  We changed it every three months and that seems to work well for her.  The handle is wider than other toothbrush and that makes it easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Did not get an assortment of colors as written in description. Received 3 green for my very girly girl, which will not make brushing her teeth any easier.</li>
    <li> Nowhere in the description did I see that these toothbrushes are FLAT in shape (to save money for the manufacturer probably). I like the rounded toothbrushes better, because they are easier for little hands to hold onto, and it teaches them coordination. These flat ones are sharp in their hand around the sides (toddlers squeeze things tight so they don&#x27;t drop them). My daughter does ok with them, but I will probably buy another one in the store that is round instead of flat, it will be more comfortable to hold. I also noticed that the photos are misleading, none of which show these brushes from the side, only from the front view, which unless you are looking very close you will not know these are the wrong shape. If you are looking for a real toddler toothbrush that is round and comfortable, these will not fit the bill. The heads are soft enough, but firm enough to clean and might also not be good for teething toddlers. I&#x27;ve noticed my daughter would rather chew on her old one that is for babies, than this one.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect toothbrush. Daughter is 20 months old and loves the hot pink brush. Fits easily in her hand and the head of bristles are soft without being too soft.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush. Soft and the bristles are good quality!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes for my toddlers sensitive mouth.  Handle is the perfect size and shape for tiny hands. My kids love that they have sparkles.</li>
    <li> my boy like it so much.</li>
    <li> Great size for little hands but I feel the bristles are too hard.</li>
    <li> It is nice, my son like it!</li>
    <li> I order these toothbrushes through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save for my 2 toddler sons. My oldest is 3 and my youngest is 1. We&#x27;ve gone through quite a few toothbrushes in this house in the past few years and these are our favorite. Great size for them to brush and for me to help. My boys also love the all of the colors they come in. The bristles are nice and soft. Perfect for efficient cleaning.</li>
    <li> My 20 month old loves these toothbrushes! We love how they are easier for little hands to grip, and when needed adults can grip them to help brush teeth.</li>
    <li> good for cleaning jewelry, which is why I bought these</li>
    <li> These are great for my 4 yr old. It gets all her teeth without my help. BPA free. Lasts longer than an ordinary toothbrush. Less than four dollars a brush so descently priced.</li>
    <li> Great product! Our toddler has used this brush for 3-4 months, and we are getting ready to order replacements. Good materials and made in the US.</li>
    <li> My 17 months old baby likes it and it&#x27;s very soft. It&#x27;s very reasonable and cheaper price than the whole foods. But the picture of 6 should be replaced because I only received 3 brushes.</li>
    <li> Purchased many times. very pleased</li>
    <li> I like the product because it is PBA free and meets certain quality standards; however, it is not a very comfortable toothbrush to hold.  I would purchase it again if I did not find a better replacement.</li>
    <li> Only toothbrushes my daughter will use! Love them.</li>
    <li> My kids decide to clean the sink or floor with the toothbrushes once in a while so I have to replace them all. Unfortunately, I like these the best of all that we&#x27;ve tried (unfortunate since I have to order them online and they cost a bit more than the others). The head is rather large, but I think that it works much better than those with a smaller head. They&#x27;re just easy to use and do a good job.</li>
    <li> I use these toothbrushes for my dog, they&#x27;re just the right size (10-lb shih tzu) and the bristles are soft enough not to damage her gums.</li>
    <li> great toddler toothbrush and a good deal with subscribe and save. Like any toddler toothbrush, the bristles do get matted and wacky from daily use over a course of a couple of months. Great for little hands.</li>
    <li> It is really soft, we have had other kids toothbrushes and my daughter would complain that they were too harsh, not this one. The handle also makes it easy for kids to hold. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves these and loves brushing. would recommend this</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t paying attention when the description said a 3 pack... silly me for judging it by the picture of 6 brushes! Deceptive! I would not have paid 12 dollars for 3 brushes if I would have know!</li>
    <li> I bought for brushing my ferrets teeth and sensitive gums but the bristles were way too stiff and not what I was expecting..</li>
    <li> Our son is approaching 3 now and he really does a good job brushing with these toothbrushes.  He hasn&#x27;t had a cavity yet. They hold up well, fit his mouth well, and we are very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for my three year old and 22 month old</li>
    <li> Brushes still going strong after a year of use.. Good to have a multiple pack.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the larger head - much easier to get and reach all of those toddler teeth! The large wide handle is great and more secure fitting in a smaller hand.  Fun variety of colors makes this a great unisex option also.</li>
    <li> Great set of toothbrushes.  My son loves and I like that when he is finished with his current one there are 2 more for him.</li>
    <li> I have bought these several times for my twin toddlers. I wish I would have found these years ago to use with my other children. These are the best children toothbrushes I have ever used. I would recommend them to anyone with small children. Once my children reach age 3 I buy a children&#x27;s Sonicare toothbrush. 6 kids, 12 and under, and none of them have a cavity or any other dental issue.</li>
    <li> No complaints here.  The bristles are super soft and the head is the perfect size for my infant and toddler.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt that these are made in the USA and with recycled materials.</li>
    <li> Good little tooth brushes for my little dogs teeth  Hope to order another set.</li>
    <li> Too big for little kid</li>
    <li> My kids 3.5 and 1.5 have always used these brushes.  We are a green household and I always look for more natural things to buy and I like the fact that these are BPA free and dye free.  My kids love them, the only thing is that they, especially my younger one, like to chew on the toothbrushes and they wear out very quickly, but that&#x27;s a problem we probably have to deal with regardless which ones we use.</li>
    <li> great toothbrush for chubby little hands and fast moving mouths!</li>
    <li> i ordered these for my 15 boys but got pink and purple...oh well they dont mind brushing their little teeth.</li>
    <li> too large for an 18 month old in my opinion. I also thought the handle would be rubberized. Not at all. Just hard plastic</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are great!  I have a 1 1/2 year old and a 3 1/2 year old.  Both love them and they are the perfect size.</li>
    <li> These are great, very soft bristle toothbrushes for small children. I like that they are made in the USA and pair perfectly with Spry xylitol toothpaste.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too big，someone like people use，And hard, is not soft。I do not think this is suitable for kids above a half years old</li>
    <li> These work great for kids (age 1, 3 &amp; 5).  They love to pick out their own color and love the sparkles.  The package includes information on how to recycle them - hooray!</li>
    <li> Perfect toddler brush. Had purchased a banana shaped brush before and my toddler would not brush at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one she likes. The colors are nice with glitter in them.</li>
    <li> Great size head and handle. Easy for adults to hold when brushing their children&#x27;s teeth and easy for my toddler to hold when she tries to brush her teeth.</li>
    <li> These tooth brush (set of 3) are really great for kids - short handle as seen and nice soft easy to reach deep in the mouth&lt;br /&gt;bristles.</li>
    <li> I got this set of toothbrushes (3 in a pack) for my daughter who was 18 months old at the time (19 months old now) after trying a different &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brand but not liking their product because it wasn&#x27;t durable.  My daughter loves to brush her teeth and also loves to chew on her toothbrush, so I need something gentle but that will last longer than 2 weeks.  I am very happy that we have found this brand, made in the USA and a product that I am not scared to let my daughter use (no chemicals).  Although the head of the toothbrush is on the bigger side for a small toddler, my daughter still likes it and lets us brush her teeth, I believe she likes the softness of the bristles.  As a mom I appreciate that it gets her teeth and gums clean and that it&#x27;s long lasting (bristles were still intact after a month, barely started curling now).  We use it every day and will be purchasing again once we run out.</li>
    <li> I was using a stage 1 Oral B brush on my 17 month old but saw these and thought they looked cute. I love how they use minimal plastic, it is recycled and the bristles are SO SOFT! I can easily brush her teeth better with this brush than the Oral B. My daughter thought it was fun to choose which color she wanted from the 3 pack and she is enthusiastic about the new brush. Will buy again. I got a pink, blue and silver in this pack.</li>
    <li> Too large for 18 months baby.</li>
    <li> These handy little toothbrushes are the perfect starter for toddlers. I received three toothbrushes each a different color. We got blue, purple and green. The toothbrush is approximately 4 inches long which is perfect for a little hand. The bristles are soft and the head of the toothbrush is small for your little one&#x27;s mouth. Although my Son prefers to brush all by himself, I allow him to practice with it before I brush his top and bottom teeth for him. Oral hygiene is extremely important and it is necessary to start children off on the right foot. This toothbrush is perfect for a toddler small child that is learning how to brush their teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s early to let new borned boby use toothbrush, but for baby, need to have good habit to clear their teeth when they are growing.</li>
    <li> To my delight our 22 month old can hold this toothbrush and I can assist him in his oral hygiene.  He is thrilled to be like his big brother and sister.</li>
    <li> These are excellent toothbrushes for toddlers.  Our daughter has been using these since she turned 18 months (now she is 2) and she loves the fun colors and sparkles.  They are super soft and have a great wide handle so she can try to brush her teeth herself.  They are also BPA free, made in the USA, and practice sustainable industry!  The cost is also pretty low when you use Subscribe and Save (especially if you get the 20% discount for five items a month!), so for three toothbrushes I think we pay about $8.  They last quite awhile, even when our daughter chew chew chews on them.  We&#x27;ll plan on using these probably until she is 3.  Just a forewarning: you cannot choose the colors, so many times we receive the same colors: clear/gray sparkles, pink/pink sparkles, and purple/purple sparkles.  However, occasionally we will get different colors like orange.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes! I started buying them for my daughter and now I use them myself too. The bristles are actually soft and the head of the brush is a good size. All of this on top of the fact that they are made in America and out of non-toxic materials.</li>
    <li> I use these with my 12 month old, and they work just fine.  They aren&#x27;t quite as durable as others, but they do the trick and are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt his gums.  Colors vary.</li>
    <li> Have been using this on my daughter since she was 18 months old. She is not 2.5 years old and we still use this tooth brush. We tried different brand before but this one is the best so far. The brush head is perfect for her little mouth, which we can move around to clean each every one of her teeth without making her feel uncomfortable. This brush is not hard but not too soft, it is just right. We would continue use this brand until she grows out of it.</li>
    <li> I like these and think the value is good. We use them on our 16 month old&#x27;s teeth. The end.</li>
    <li> best tooth brush for little kids ever!! it has wider bristles perfect for getting good coverage for little teeth without tons of maneuvering.  handle makes for easy holding. great sparkly colors and lasts even after being chomped. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> My daughter somehow keeps biting the bristles out of the brush</li>
    <li> it is so easy for me to help my boy to brush the teeth. i love the big one head.</li>
    <li> We try to buy made in the USA for all products, and while that takes a lot of time, and sometimes money it&#x27;s worth it to our family. So first,  kudos to Radius for keeping their factories here in America!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids love these toothbrushes. With two small children I try to keep the drawer stocked with Totz so there are plenty of color choices and everyone is happy. The more excited they are about their brushing tools, the better they brush!</li>
    <li> Colorful baby liked it</li>
    <li> My almost two year old loves these toothbrushes. It&#x27;s great they come in a three pack and in different colors.</li>
    <li> My 1 year is old just learning how to brush his teeth and he loves these different colored brushes. He asks to brush his teeth all day. They are small enough for his little hand and it&#x27;s a good price for a pack of three.</li>
    <li> My daughter is very like to use it, but I think the brush head can be smaller and more soft for children under 3.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  I am buying these brushes again because it is soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to agitate my toddler when it hits her gums.  It comes in bright colors and is easy for them to hold themselves.  The only thing I would change is to make the head a little smaller so it fit a little better.  My daughter is now 3 and it is still large for her mouth.</li>
    <li> Super soft, but after a week&#x27;s use by my 3 y/o, the bristles all bent outwards. Does not last very long.</li>
    <li> Baby enjoys brushing his teeth with this item.  It is soft enough to not cause any damage from errant brushing but just stiff enough to brush away any lingering debris.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this for awhile, had the smaller size Radius before 18 months.  I really like this product, the bristles stay put despite some chewing, it&#x27;s not too big for little mouths, and it&#x27;s soft and non irritating.  I&#x27;ll stick with this brand.</li>
    <li> bristles came out too soon after using it, dangerous, gave 2 stars as I like the shape and that they are made of safe materials for my children but can&#x27;t recommend due to the bristles coming out</li>
    <li> perfect！&lt;br /&gt;i like the color&lt;br /&gt;its different from the pic&lt;br /&gt;beatuiful than pics&lt;br /&gt;i will come back&lt;br /&gt;ths&lt;br /&gt;a lot</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The face of the brush is wide enough for my three year old.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes for kids: its wider head makes brushing more effective!</li>
    <li> Perfect for toddlers learning to brush. My 2 yo loves to brush now and the colors are fun. Better product than what I could find in the store.</li>
    <li> Our toddler loves these, so WE love them. Only complaint is that you can&#x27;t specify a color. Which was fine for a while. But now that someone in our house LOVES purple, it would be nice to be able to order a purple toothbrush. But I&#x27;m not going to dock the product a star because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice flat handle is easy to hold onto for a parent even while a toddler squirms, and it&#x27;s wide and flat enough that the kid can brush herself (as best she can for now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We end up ordering these every few months as we lose them or they wear out. Not that they really have worn out — just that … with a toddler, they tend to end up places where you&#x27;d never want to put them in your mouth again.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrushes! My 21 month old loves them &amp; they seem to be holding up well.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding soft toothbrushes and decided to try these. These are made for children, but I am an adult and my dentist has told me to use only soft bristles, which are hard to find. I found these nicely soft and I actually like the short, broad handle - much easier to grip and maneuver. They are nice and compact for travel as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and softness for my two-year-old.</li>
    <li> Great soft toothbrushes for my toddler son. He couldn&#x27;t tolerate many other brands as they had pretty rough bristles for his mouth. The trade off for soft bristles is the short lasting time of the toothbrushes, but I will take that any moment for increased usability.</li>
    <li> The head is too big for my toddlers mouth.  Maybe it&#x27;s that way so toddler will hit more teeth as they aren&#x27;t as coordinated to get the brush aim perfect, but my LO doesn&#x27;t like the size of the head.  I got a give away toothbrush from my dentist that has a smaller head than this and she always steals my toothbrush from me. I let her have it after I rinse it well.</li>
    <li> My son likes to brush his own teeth, and these toothbrushes do a good job of covering a lot of surface area. Most toddler toothbrushes are so small and have small heads/brushes but this one is nice and big. It is also wide to it is easy to grip. My son lies the variety in colors. Will continue to buy this product for my kids.</li>
    <li> My 19 month old used to cry and her gums would bleed using the toddler colgate soft brissle toothbrush. We used these dor the first time tonight, no bleeding and no fussing. Wasy for her to hold as well so she can participate.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was perfect for my son when we started brushing his teeth. Now that he is two, we have moved up in size and it is still a perfect fit. He loves the colors and he loves brushing his teeth while mommy and daddy brush theirs.</li>
    <li> Love the wide handle and fun colors. These are great!</li>
    <li> Make sure that you remember this is a 3-pack, and doesn&#x27;t include all 5 colors as shown on the photo. The product is fine, though a bit on the cheap side and so your child will likely go through them faster.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes. My toddler likes picking his color. They are the perfect size for my 2 year old.</li>
    <li> Love the colors , my son loves brushing his teeth with these.</li>
    <li> Toddler loves them - glad so many come in a pack as he tends to lose them frequently</li>
    <li> Love these. And the listing isn&#x27;t clear but I got three individually packaged toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was perfect for my 2 year old. The bristles were soft enough for her little teeth but it still did the job well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle was also perfect for her little hand. She loved it and was super excited for the colorful toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is not too short or too long. Makes my daughter feels like she&#x27;s a grown-up</li>
    <li> OUr kids like these toothbrushes more than some others like the surround or colgate brushes. They can hold the larger handle better than narrower ones and they definitely brush more with these.</li>
    <li> Cute, and easy for my 3 year old to use.  The only down side is that they don&#x27;t fit in my tooth brush holder at home.</li>
    <li> My kids (3 &amp; 1) and I enjoy using these brushes. They are soft but still clean well and I don&#x27;t have kids crying when I have to brush their teeth.</li>
    <li> I love these they are nice and colorful. They are a three pack and they are just what i need for a little boy.</li>
    <li> both my girls 3 years old and 20 month old use these brushes and they seem like they are good.</li>
    <li> it is small enough for her small fingers. brush is soft and easy to brush a toddler small mouth.i also love it&#x27;s BPA free which is hard to get in stores.</li>
    <li> On my quest to buy mostly made in the USA, finding a toothbrush was not as easy as it should be.  I love this toothbrush and so does my son. I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
    <li> These are really great--just the right size and shape for my toddler grandson--now willing to try to brush his teeth at 20 months.&lt;br /&gt;These are superior in design to what I could find in stores--soft and rounded with a fat handle for easy grip.</li>
    <li> I love your speedy delivery, but I have known something about this item. This is fluorescent toothbrush. is it right???&lt;br /&gt;After I bought it, I heard the news... I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes. The surface is large enough for baby to brush their own teeth, with help, and not miss much.&lt;br /&gt;Vegetable based bristles make me feel better about my baby chewing on them for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Wider handle easier to handle as well. And the colors, with sparkles, are fun.</li>
    <li> We love these brushes!  The heads of the brush are large but very soft.  It makes brushing for my little one much easier. I will be buying these again!</li>
    <li> Great made in USA and vegetable product. Very soft and easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;In fact I used this for my puppy brushing. Very useful and Highly recommended for dog owners who brush their dog&#x27;s teeth.</li>
    <li> These are for my Yorkie.  They are very soft and she doesn&#x27;t mind having her teeth brushed with them.  Great colors!</li>
    <li> Good for my two-year old daughter. She loves the purple color. The brush is soft and she can use it by herself.</li>
    <li> easy to hold for small hands</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft as described, the down side is it is worn easily and since my younger one likes to bite, I can see the prints on the edge of the brush head.</li>
    <li> Very practical, fast delivery, love it</li>
    <li> Before this brand he hated brushing his teeth. I love the fact that there is enough bristles to where I feel it cleans all of his teeth very well! i just wish you could pick the colors. I have purchased the set for a second time and still no complaints. Bristles have never came off- even when he bites the toothbrush when he is teething.</li>
    <li> Does a great job cleaning my 17-month old&#x27;s teeth. Soft and gentle on the gums.</li>
    <li> Our two-year-old twins who was always fought us during night time to brush their teeth, seem to be taking to these toothbrushes quite well.</li>
    <li> Use for my two year old son. He doesn&#x27;t like brushing like most toddlers but these work nice for both of us to get a few brushes in each :)</li>
    <li> We tried a few different toothbrushes, but others seemed to have too stiff of bristles for sensitive little gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are soft, but still firm enough to actually clean my kid&#x27;s teeth. Just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus: they&#x27;re made of sparkly glitter plastic, which makes it a little easier to get my toddler excited about brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT AND PERFECT SIZE FOR BRUSHING MY CATS TEETH.</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrushes that are made in the USA!</li>
    <li> Great for my 3 yo. He started using when he&#x27;s 2.</li>
    <li> My toddler loves these!</li>
    <li> Great design - large handles for little hands.  Bristles are nice and soft.  And the colors are nice and bright.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. My toddler is approaching the age of 2 and was looking to upgrade his baby tooth brush.</li>
    <li> My 20 month old loves these. We purchased many other brands, but these seem to be the best! Big bristle head and nicely shaped handle. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i always buy this for my 3-years kids, this Bristles is very soft, they not harm gum, so ,recommond for kids,you can miss it.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for almost a year. The idea behind the brush is wonderful, but it doesn&#x27;t work well in the long run. The brush is too soft to remove plaque. Recently my two-year old had her first check up with the dentist and she had a lot of build-up. I&#x27;ve been brushing her teeth at least three times a day after each meal. I&#x27;d recommend these for the first year, but after a different brush with harder bristles.</li>
    <li> I bought these after trying a couple of other tooth brushes (finger brush, another brush with bristles) for my son. These are my favorite thus far. The bristles on these are very soft unlike the other ones I tried. My son also seems less reluctant to brush his teeth with these. The large head provides good coverage with fewer brush strokes. Unlike some of the people here, I did not see any premature curling of the bristles. They seem to be quite sturdy given how soft the bristles are. My son started complaining about brush hurting after he switched to another brand due to it being &amp;#34;Elmo brush&amp;#34;, but after we switched back to these, he stopped complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do seem a little pricey for simple tooth brushes, but given that I haven&#x27;t found anything better, I would buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4 stars due to the elevated price. Otherwise, this is an excellent product.)</li>
    <li> I like these because they are wider than regular kid toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easier for me to know that I&#x27;m actually brushing my kid&#x27;s teeth when I use this brush as compared to a regular small headed brush.  It is a little tougher to get the top teeth but I feel more confident that I&#x27;m getting them than when I use a smaller head.  With a regular kid&#x27;s toothbrush I sometimes feel that I&#x27;m jabbing my kid in the gums rather than brushing their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kid is 2.5 and I&#x27;ve been using these from ~18 months.</li>
    <li> great for adults, save your gums</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about time I find toothbrushes NOT made in China. Love these.</li>
    <li> I was on the fence on ordering these and kept them in my cart for awhile, but my son at 14 months was too big for the finger toothbrush I had been using and needed the real deal.  I finally decided on these and am very happy.  The brush is small enough for his now 15 month old mouth and the bristles are gentle.  He loves getting his teeth brushed and get excited when he sees the brush come out.  The handle is wide enough for him to hold it himself.  Great product!  I only use this for brushing and have not have any issues with bristles falling out.</li>
    <li> These are great toothbrushes for toddlers - they reach those back teeth easily and get rid of the junk that can build up after eating.  My son likes to brush his teeth, so I brush them, then he gets a turn, and these are a perfect size for 18-36 month children.</li>
    <li> My 18 month child has used it for a month. He kept biting the brush but so far it is still intact.</li>
    <li> They are pretty brushes, but the bristles come out very quickly. We are disappointed with this product and dint recommend it.</li>
    <li> These are just the right size for my 2 year old and I especially like the wide handle. The first one only lasted 2 months so I guess its good that it comes in a 3 pack!</li>
    <li> It has soft bristle for my 18 months old and it is wide enough to easily clean all teeth well.</li>
    <li> Great, simple toothbrushes that are a good shape and size for my toddler.  She loves the sparkles in the handles and I don&#x27;t have to pay for characters/branding.  :)</li>
    <li> Love these! I use them and so do my grandkids.</li>
    <li> Great size for my 2 year old.  The 3-pack was a great value to me.  They&#x27;re soft bristles and do the job.  Sparkles in the plastic part are fun.</li>
    <li> After my son chewed through two other toothbrushes (ripped out the bristles), I bought these on Amazon S&amp;S and they are awesome! Perfect for this little hands to hold and easy enough to get his mouth clean.</li>
    <li> Holds up well to chewing and it&#x27;s very ergonomic for little hands. The bright colors are exciting and my 2 year old carries these around because he loves them so much.</li>
    <li> Love the size of these.  The larger heads make it easy for my son to brush his own teeth.</li>
    <li> Great size for toddlers and cheap enough to replace monthly ( I have three toddlers that like to chew them ) all my kids like to chew on them which I think is great because it means the toothbrush gets in their mouth without a fight. I do wish that the handle was all rounded, like I thought from judging the picture. It&#x27;s actually flat. Would be a really great product if the handle was fully rounded, for a better grasp for small hands.</li>
    <li> Good toddler toothbrush! WAY cheaper than what you buy in the store. And a lot simpler.</li>
    <li> This is a subscribe and save item in our household.  I originally purchased it because I was looking for a BPA free toothbrush for my toddler.  I found these and decided to try them.  I like the thick handle.  It is perfect for little hands!  The bristles are gentle on the gums.  The toothbrushes come in a variety of sparkly fun colors.</li>
    <li> The toothbrushes are a great size for a toddler&#x27;s hand.  It&#x27;s hard to find toothbrushes for toddlers and so important they start learning good habits when they&#x27;re young.</li>
    <li> Luckily for us that randomly we received the three pack in pink, purple, and white. And they&#x27;re very glitzy/sparkly which is wonderful because kiddo did not like how wide the ends on these were at first. A few days in and she asks for the &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; one. We haven&#x27;t even tried switching from her usual beloved Abby Cadabby toothpaste but will try soon to something a bit more holistic. I&#x27;m not crazy about the handle and the curve on the end seems kinda sharp/flimsy. Not that I leave her to brush her teeth herself (I brush at first getting as much as I can and then let her take over for a bit, she&#x27;s not yet 2), but you don&#x27;t want to give a creative toddler a shiv! Will update review when we&#x27;ve had these more than a week.</li>
    <li> I bought the tooth brushes for my niece as gift. I hope it will be good to use.</li>
    <li> perfect toddler toothbrush, small and soft, the only one we buy now</li>
    <li> My two and half year old daughter love this tooth brush. I have been using this brush ever since she needed a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old did not like having her teeth brushed before and it took a lot of convincing to get her to agree, and it seemed like the brush was hurting her lips and gums, and especially her class 4 lip tie. Since it&#x27;s really important to brush around the tie I searched for another brush that would be more gentle. This brush is perfect, not only does she let me brush her teeth when she finishes brushing them, but she asks me to brush them! Not grimacing while I brush, even near her lip tie. So glad we found these, even my 9 month old loves brushing with them!</li>
    <li> good ^^&lt;br /&gt;Would use the original purchase was made​​.&lt;br /&gt;My kids use. Better.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. You will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are great, and the perfect size for my 2 year old. The handles are a bit thicker than other store bought toddler toothbrushes (like OralB), and are easier for my child to handle.</li>
    <li> No control over the colors but the brushes are nice and soft making it easier to gently brush sensitive toddler gums. We play &amp;#34;tickle the teeth&amp;#34; and he doesn&#x27;t mind it so much.</li>
    <li> My 2 y/o loves these toothbrushes.  They head of it is wide, so it&#x27;s great for him to practice brushing by himself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for 18 months+, however, it&#x27;s too large for my son who is 3 years old. I think it might be ok for my son when he is 6、7 years old.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush for toddlers.  It is soft enough, but still does the cleaning job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baby version worked well, too!!</li>
    <li> Feeling good and try to re-purchase the quality products and excellent Hanun Dress</li>
    <li> Good for the kids, but nothing special.  Kids do like the sparkly colors available.</li>
    <li> Works great on my 2 yr old.</li>
    <li> They work well for our toddler. No complaints.</li>
    <li> good quality, have yet to use them on baby, but they are packaged great and feel very soft! Love the glitter in theme! ONLY COMES WITH 3 though! don&#x27;t be mislead by pic!!</li>
    <li> This is the only toothbrush I&#x27;ve used on my son since we first started to brush his teeth. I love that&#x27;s a family owned business and I love the toothbrush. My son is constantly biting on this, but none of the bristles have come loose. The bristles are soft so they have never cut his gums. I like the handle of the brush it&#x27;s easy to hold and he finds it easy to hold as well. I will continue to use this toothbrush till he is old enough for the next step. I like that it&#x27;s plain and doesn&#x27;t have characters on it.</li>
    <li> Love the bright colors, chubby hand friendly handle, and the texture of the bristles. Soft enough for tender gums but stiff enough to actually clean those little teeth. No silly cartoons for the kids to fight over. Just a cute, simple product that does its job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend these. These came apart so quickly - a bristle would come out while brushing and my toddler would get it in his mouth.</li>
    <li> My son (2 years) loves these brushes because they are soft to his gums and teeth. I took out a star because I wish they were made of a renewable source instead of plastic.</li>
    <li> USA made, no bad chemicals. 1.5 and 4 year old use these with no problems. Good brushes. Good value.</li>
    <li> Love these! I brush my 2yr old&#x27;s teeth after EVERY meal - so the quality is important.  The bristles are nice and soft, and large enough to cover his teeth. We also bought the &#x27;Surround Toddler Toothbrush&#x27; set and these are better since they cover more tooth area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is he has bit the brush on occasion and the bristles have pulled out some.  I just cut off the extended bristles and figure it&#x27;s expected with toddlers, but may be a safety concern for some.  Note this only happens on occasion - just something to watch for during use.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these toothbrushes. I might try getting some adult sized ones for myself. Makes it easier to brush my kid&#x27;s teeth. :)</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush for a toddler.  When I bought this, I was thinking &amp;#34;How different can it be?&amp;#34; from the Oral B toddler toothbrush I was using.  This toothbrush feels much easier to handle on my almost two-year old and the bristles are nice and soft so no complaining.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this one out.</li>
    <li> Our toddler loves these sparkly toothbrushes BUT we would prefer to choose our own colors! We still continue to order them, but it would be so nice to have a girls or boys pack available to purchase.</li>
    <li> These are the right size and soft enough for your little ones. Our children love the variety of colors.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for a toddler.  They come in random colors though.  We received a pink, white, and an orange one.</li>
    <li> I finally found a kids&#x27; toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t have ridiculous characters on them. Its the perfect size and I love the variety of colors. We have these on subscribe and save, and although you can&#x27;t specifically choose the color you want, my kids actually enjoy seeing what colors are sent to them every 3 months when our new ones arrive.</li>
    <li> works great. not too large and just the right size for good teeth brushing</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t understand why manufactures need to put dye on bristles of a toothbrush? These are the only brand of toothbrushes my kids use. These are a bit costly, but I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit extra on something that is dye/bpa free. My kids do prefer characters on their toothbrushes, but they do love the sparkles. I love the wide handle which makes for easy brushing for my toddler.</li>
    <li> Good product. Quite resistant compared to other toothbrushes for kids. My daughter loves the colors and the sparkles. It is also easy to hold for small hands.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for my little girl!</li>
    <li> These are good. But they&#x27;re just like any other toddler toothbrush, they get chewed to smithereens. Someone needs to come up with cheap, a couple time use, disposable toddler toothbrushes. My kid goes through them so quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My 12 month old loved it.  Fit right into his little hand and he got the hang of using it right away.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s OK with its quality. Wish my baby likes it. It&#x27;s better if there are more choices of the colour.</li>
    <li> I love these toddler toothbrushes!  They are non-branded so my little is not subjected to cartoon characters and ads more than absolutely necessary.  They also have a nice, broad head that is super-soft for little gums and a easy-to-grip handle for little people.  The sparkles in the different colours are cute and my little likes them.</li>
    <li> My children, ages 3 and 5, have been using this toothbrush for a few years.  We love them because they are slightly larger than the typical toothbrush which gives me more peace of mind thinking that they are getting more coverage and therefore better oral hygiene. The handle is a great fit for little hands and adults helpers, too.  And more importantly, they are very soft bristled and as an adult who has some gum recision, I know how important it is that the brush doesn&#x27;t damage the gum from stiff bristles.  I just switched my 5 year old (who will be 6 in a month) to the older kids Radius (I think it&#x27;s age 6 or 7 on the label) and love this one too.  I saw a few comments about the bristles falling out from chewing and we&#x27;ve never had this experience.  And we&#x27;ve gone through at least 10 toothbrushes per kid (we have one in each bathroom).  I can only think that a toothbrush is not meant to be chewed on - there are other more appropriate toys that are specifically manufactured as \\&quot;chewy toys\\&quot; for that purpose.</li>
    <li> We bought these for my granddaughter she loves them.</li>
    <li> My toddler loves to brush her teeth with these toothbrushes. From the moment I took them out the pack, brushing teeth has been a joy. I don&#x27;t know what it is but she love these toothbrushes may be color and soft bristles so no more headlocks which is much better for everyone. I will never buy another brand of toothbrush for her. Thank you Radius for making my life so much easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always in the look out for products that are Made in the USA. I am extremely pleased with this product. It has a good grip, light in weight, the bristles are soft &amp; it looks pretty with glitter. Another thing that I like about this product is that is made in a solar powered facility run by women! They waste as little as possible &amp; the package is made of recycled materials.  Great green product! Two thumps up!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cost effective solution for toothbrushes that have to be thrown away because maybe your toddler (like mine) likes to see things &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; ... toilet.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 30 something year old sister who is going through chemo. This has become her favorite toothbrush. It&#x27;s very soft and I guess there&#x27;s something about the sparkles that make her happy. :) God bless anyone who is going through this.</li>
    <li> This appears to be well made and is a good size for my 19 month old.  We have just started using it so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up, but I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems.</li>
    <li> Our 20 mo son likes these a lot and its a good upgrade to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; brush.  He holds it well and so far so good.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes.  It makes brushing our 3 yo son&#x27;s teeth easier.  The bristles are softer which it makes it easier on him.  The bristles are shorter which it makes it easier for me since I can get the outside surfaces of his molars.  I&#x27;ve bought these again.  Definitely our favorite kids toothbrush.</li>
    <li> You are a fool not to buy this toothbrush. Watch the CEO on PCNTV demonstrate the product and once you buy it you will never go back to a common style tooth brush.</li>
    <li> My 16 month old son has a class 4 upper lip tie. The only time it&#x27;s ever caused us trouble is with brushing his teeth. Most brushes are too hard, and catch on his tie, making him not want to brush.&lt;br /&gt;These are fairly stiff when dry, but after running them under warm water, they&#x27;re soft enough that my son doesn&#x27;t mind letting me brush his teeth. Only toothbrushes he&#x27;ll accept....so definitely worth the 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> These are great for my two years olds.  There is no rubber that can be eaten or picked at and the bristles last fairly long considering my kids eat them.  I have tried at least 4 other brands and these seem to hold up best.</li>
    <li> uh these are kinda big for a toddlers mouth and when I first opened them, there was a white powder that came off the bristles. No thatnks</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these brushes. The fact that they are BPA free sold it to me. They come in nice colors and hold pretty well to Toddler brushing.</li>
    <li> We ran the last one into the ground as the store where we bought the first one stopped carrying it and our daughter wouldn&#x27;t use any of the other brushes we tried. [We couldn&#x27;t find a replacement because we didn&#x27;t know the name. So we had to use the old one until I thought to look at Google Images - bingo!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is right for 2.5-year-old hands when she is brushing, yet also a good shape and size for adult hands when we brush for her. The head is large enough to get the job done efficiently, but small enough to fit into the small spaces inside a child&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I didn&#x27;t pay attention to how long the first one lasted, the second one is holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor downside: the child-hand-sized handle is easy for a child to hold, but a bit too wide to fit into the built-in toothbrush holder in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I figure that since our daughter is willing to use this, she&#x27;ll develop good dental hygiene habits, protecting her teeth and her smile. First of all, she&#x27;ll save thousands on dental care. Maybe her smile will get her to Hollywood, and we&#x27;ll be able to retire to the south of France. Another reason I love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I am currently in Invisalign treatment so I always carry with me a goody bag of toothpaste/brush/floss. I find these smaller brushes fit perfectly in my bag and are soft enough to not scratch the invisalign tray.</li>
    <li> Best toddler toothbrush ever</li>
    <li> I am fond of toothbrushes coming in a 3 pack especially for my toddler, in case one accidentally gets dropped on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose vegetable based bristles are better for the environment and that is a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My child WAS using the MAM 1st toothbrush with a smaller head and softer bristles so it took a week or so to get use to these Radius Totz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that my daughter can leave teeth marks in the back of the head, but never fear because there is an extra one in the closet!</li>
    <li> A little bummed about these after all the positive reviews. On my third one now and they barely last a month each. Each one has had the bristles come out in my two year old&#x27;s mouth. Luckily they are made from pretty safe stuff but it seems strange that this happens in a toddler toothbrush.</li>
    <li> these are great for the little kiddos. easy for us and them to hold, right size and better quality than the usual brushes that are out there.  our go to kiddo brush</li>
    <li> I bought these for my cat.  I also got organic catnip to put on the brush to make teeth brushing more appealing to my cat.  That combination works great.  The bristles are soft enough that he can safely rub up against them and chew them a little but sturdy enough that they will survive a little while.  My cat now practically brushes his own teeth.  I just have to hold the brush.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothbrush I use on my daughter.  Her way of brushing her teeth is to chew on the bristles and the head.  Since its BPA free, I feel safer when she chews on th e head of the brush</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 20months old daughter, she hasn&#x27;t start to use it yet, so I can&#x27;t give any review for the quality yet. But I am a little bit disappointed on receiving same color on all three individual pack brush, I was expecting different color brushes.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I worried since the head looked so big. However it was perfect size for my son&#x27;s little mouth. So soft. He loves brushing his teeth.</li>
    <li> My toddler really likes this multicolor tooth brushes and I like it because it all made with nature materiel.</li>
    <li> very soft bristles , great product</li>
    <li> Initially I was worried if size was too big for a toddler. But tHis turned out to be a perfect one. Soft,  gentle over gums, easy to use and my toddler loves it.</li>
    <li> Unlike other brands we tried, My daughter loves using it! It seemed soft and comfortable to use. Would recommend this!</li>
    <li> my son likes to brush his teeth with this brush. It fits really well in his hand and is easy for him to hold and us to help him.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately we had a terrible experience with these. The first brush lasted two days with my 2.5 yr old son before the bristles started coming out. The next brush last 4 days... I didn&#x27;t even bother with the 3rd.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes. Prior to using these, we just used a child&#x27;s toothbrush that could be purchased at any drugstore or grocery store. These Radius toothbrushes are SO much better, and it has been much easier to brush my two year old&#x27;s teeth. Plus, I love that the bristles are made from vegetables--how cool. I will repurchase for sure!</li>
    <li> This brush truly is extra soft.  My 5 year old destroyed its bristles long before the 3-month window expired.  If your kid has a habit of chewing toothbrushes, then look for something firmer.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a simple toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Pretty cheap toothbrushes. Note there are only 3 per pack, not 5 like the picture shows. Don&#x27;t think they are worth the money.</li>
    <li> The first picture of six tooth brushes is a bit misleading. I was expecting more than just three. It definitely said it was a 3 pack, but I was expecting 18 all together. May that was too good of a deal to be true, but they could also eliminate the pack of 6 picture or replace it with a pack of three picture.</li>
    <li> Great to have on hand for the grandkids.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old asks to brush her teeth several times a day now. It works really well to reach all her teeth and gums easily, and she enjoys using it on herself too. We will keep buying.</li>
    <li> Very nice, soft set of toothbrushes.  My 2 year old is able to use these no problem.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get my kid to STOP brushing her teeth!! She loves these, bright and colorful, and they clean her mouth up right!</li>
    <li> These are some high quality toothbrushes. They are easy for little hands to hold and last a while.</li>
    <li> soft and colorful, my kid liked it very much</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> The bristles get bent and deformed very quickly. Probably software than adult soft brush, but may be intended to be that way because kids can&#x27;t relate their brushing pressure.  Not sure if enamel on baby teeth is softer than on adult teeth so that might also be any they are softer.</li>
    <li> im blessed with a child who doesnt mind brushing teeth, and shes had tinkerbell, pooh bear, meowing, oinknig, barking, sing song brushes...and these simple sparkly ones are her fav.</li>
    <li> Bristles get softer when immersed in water thankfully.  My 16mos old boy HATED brushing his teeth before with a free pediatric toothbrush we got from a dentist.  He would not open his mouth.  I think the bristles were too hard. After having this RAdius brush for a few days, he now tries to reach for the toothbrush even when it&#x27;s not time to brush!  He now opens his mouth and lets us brush his teeth!  Winner!</li>
    <li> Definitely better than the NUK brand we used to buy for our toddler. As others have found, those just couldn&#x27;t keep their bristles straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are terrific and fairly good value. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> my 2.5 year old loves these toothbrushes.  They&#x27;re fun colors and easy for her to maneuver and handle.</li>
    <li> My nieces gum stopped bleeding after using this.</li>
    <li> They do the job, are soft and have good coverage. It&#x27;s a chore keeping little ones&#x27; teeth clean, but these help!</li>
    <li> This is a great easy to hold toothbrush for little hands. The bristle while soft do last a child&#x27;s brushing, that is to say the chewing, pressing down harder than one should and sucking of the toothbrush that destroy a brush well before it should.  The best part for myself is that it is made in the USA, particularly because of the above mentioned reason. The price is not to bad when you do Subscribe and Save as well.</li>
    <li> Did not last more than a few weeks. My toddler son loves the colors &amp; wide base, but the bristles gor all raggedy very quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like these toothbrushes due to the wide design but my 2 year old ends up pulling the bristles out fairly quickly.  So, I keep buying them but it is a problem.</li>
    <li> While these don&#x27;t make my 18 month old son want to have his teeth brushed anymore than his old toothbrush did, they have longer handles than his old toothbrush so it makes it easier for me to brush his teeth.  I like that they don&#x27;t have annoying characters on them, as all the toothbrushes they sell in the supermarkets do.  We use these with the Spry baby/toddler toothpaste in strawberry-banana flavor.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good and sturdy, which is important for a toddler with brand new teeth!  Easy to keep clean and don&#x27;t hurt my little girl&#x27;s gums.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long.  My 18 month likes to chew her toothbrushes and after a week the bristles spread out and got pretty worn.  It does have a good large brush head.</li>
    <li> Use these to brush my dog&#x27;s teeth.  Soft and gentle and really like the colors!!  And they last a long time.  I always wash after every use.</li>
    <li> These are very soft and have great handles, made especially for tender gums and small little hands. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my 4 year old and it seems to fit his (smallish) mouth perfectly and I love the shape of the brush heads. The bristles are very soft and gentle but enough to get his teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Doesn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;ve had to replace them fairly quickly as they seem to fray easily. One star deducted for that since these aren&#x27;t cheap at that rate of replacement.</li>
    <li> We absolutely LOVE these toothbrushes. They are so much softer than the ones I could buy in-store. My little one loves them as well!</li>
    <li> My son loves these tooth brushes! The colors are fun the bristles are soft for his little teeth and gums. And I BIG thanks for making them BPA free!my family will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> Love these. Our son has autism and these are just the right softness...brushing his teeth is often a battle. Will buy these again.</li>
    <li> nice fat handles to help small hands learn how to brush! multi-pack was useful as we go through these quickly given they tend to end up dropped in the toilet, bath etc :)</li>
    <li> Have purchased many different types of toddler toothbrushes. This one is, hands down, THE BEST. My little one has been using it since 12mo. She&#x27;s 3 now and still loves using it!  Oh, and guess what? It&#x27;s made in the USA. How cool is that?</li>
    <li> Our 18 month old is teething so I bought the three pack of these to throw in the freezer and pull out when she needed a &#x27;chew&#x27; to soothe those gums. Works perfectly. Only suggestion is that maybe more care should be made in manufacturing the handles. I had to take a nail file to a few rough edges for fear of them slicing her little hands. No big deal, but thought it should be mentioned.</li>
    <li> The head is too big for my 2-year-old.</li>
    <li> I love it. good choice&lt;br /&gt;I needed these goods for my son.&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;someday i will purchase it again..</li>
    <li> purchase this for my nieces kids. its hard to find toothbrushes for kids under the age of 2.  nicely made &amp; the kids love them.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little big for 2 years old baby , but the quality is good.</li>
    <li> One of the best kids toothbrushes out there. I have tried a lot of them and then settled on these.</li>
    <li> It is too big for my 2 years old child. I Think it is also too big for &amp;#60;4 years old child.</li>
    <li> First tooth brush that doesn&#x27;t make my 16 month old cry!!!! Yay!</li>
    <li> The design of this toothbrush is the best I&#x27;ve seen. My daughter tightens up her cheeks when I&#x27;m trying to brush the outside of her teeth, and I usually have trouble doing this part, but the head of this toothbrush is not as thick, so I can do the outside of her teeth quite easily. I&#x27;m also happy that it doesn&#x27;t have a dyed strip in the middle because she can&#x27;t have artificial colors. The handle is also wider and flatter, so it&#x27;s very easy to hold for me and her. I&#x27;ll watch out for the bristles falling out as one reviewer mentioned, but as of the second day, I love it and will buy more.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for our baby who is learning to brush his own teeth.  Good size &amp; shape, &amp; baby loves the colors.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled I discovered these toothbrushes!  My 5 year old and 2 year old kids use them and they are perfect -- great colors, just the right size, and durable.  The fact that they are made in the USA and the environmental benefits are a huge bonus.</li>
    <li> I wanted a toothbrush made in USA and this one is great! My 3 yr old loves this toothbrush even more than her favorite character toothbrushes because the bristles are so soft.</li>
    <li> LOVE these tooth brushes. I am glad a bought a pack of three so they&#x27;ll last almost a year. I hope to find them again later on. My daughter doesn&#x27;t mind getting her teeth brushed with these and I assume because they are bigger than the average toddler toothbrushes in the pharmacies.</li>
    <li> The only toothbrushes I buy for my girls.</li>
    <li> very good and my son loves it. Sign up for the delivery</li>
    <li> And so do I. I like that they are made in USA, and made of green materials. The bristles are nice and soft and clean well. The head of the brush is not too big, my baby has been using these since she was 15 months old, we have used at least 4 of them so far. The handle is a good size for her to use herself and she loves the sparkly colors they come in. Very happy with these. When she was younger I used the clear/smaller one that Radius made and that worked well too. I haven&#x27;t had bristles come out like other reviewers mentioned, but I don&#x27;t let her chew on them either, we just brush with them and I supervise her while she is doing it. The bristles don&#x27;t curl out either, that is usually a sign that you are brushing too hard.</li>
    <li> I love these! My 2 year old bites his toothbrushes and I have to replace every 2 weeks. These last a bit longer and I love that they are wide. I feel I can clean better with them .</li>
    <li> ON划词翻译ON实时翻译&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 18 months of the child size is too big, and the hair is too hard</li>
    <li> Great design. Easy for my daughter to hold herself. Hold up really well.</li>
    <li> Work well and quantity is good seeing as my 20 month old likes to sleep with them, so he has a collection going in his crib right now.  Good chance of finding an extra toothbrush in there at any given point in time.</li>
    <li> Bristles get beat up pretty quickly.  I have a two year old and a one year old that we use these things on.  I change them out once every 3-4 weeks though because the bristles don&#x27;t hold up too well.  I have mixed opinions about that because bristles that are too hard would not be healthy for their gums.  The handle is thin, and that&#x27;s why it is docked 1-star.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are wonderful for a small child! Love them. But there&#x27;s only 3 in order, 6 are pictured, but it&#x27;s just 3.</li>
    <li> The picture is deceiving...but it does state &amp;#34;3 pack&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I have been using this since 2 years, and when I check the breath of my kid its absolutely fresh. I used some other brushes before thinking these are too expensive but these are absolutely worth it.  The head is a little large that cleans back and front of the teeth in one stroke. I can visually tell that the teeth is clean.</li>
    <li> Great size for my three year old. Well designed product. Minimal packaging appreciated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only received 3 toothebrushes, and i don&#x27;t know the reason</li>
    <li> These are great toothbrushes for toddlers. I like this brand very much. The color options are great. My toddler likes to brush his teeth with this brush.</li>
    <li> My son is 2 1/2 and he&#x27;s been brushing his teeth on his own more or less for the last year or so.  I have had probably 10 toothbrushes in that time because he like to chew the ones that have the rubber handles...thereby rendering it useless after a short while.  These are great.  He actually just brushes and goes.  I like the big head and width of the toothbrush and love that it&#x27;s not rubber so he&#x27;s not inclined to chew it. Great buy!</li>
    <li> For the most part I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My childs&#x27; favoriate ^^</li>
    <li> Only received one in the three pack.</li>
    <li> The display picture was misleading with six brushes showing but the package is only for three.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft, as described.  You do have to wet them for them to feel soft, but that&#x27;s fine.  We do that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;The head of the toothbrush, while smaller than an adult&#x27;s toothbrush, is still larger than some other toddler toothbrushes we&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s just a little too big to fit in my 18 month-old&#x27;s mouth comfortably.  It would probably be fine for a 4 year old.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the bristles almost instantly started curling out, making it seem like the toothbrush was really much, much older than it was.  After a week, it looked like we&#x27;d been using it for a year.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s uncomfortable for the bristles to be curling out like that, it seems like it might be.</li>
    <li> Not as soft as the detachable ones made for adults, which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> A little thick and large in the head area for some small toddler mouths but I think it is a good product.</li>
    <li> served their purpose.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for our little toddlers! The head is wide which is great for our toddlers who want to brush their teeth without Mama&#x27;s help (but I do anyway). The handle is perfect so they have a good grip on the toothbrush. We have been using RADIUS since their first tooth came out but we used the extra extra soft bristle first. Their visit at the dentist is always a success..no cavities because we use this wonderful toothbrush....and of course, we brush their teeth twice a day! ;)</li>
    <li> Our 2.5 year old has used these since we could start brushing her teeth.  They&#x27;re comfortable and wide enough to thoroughly get all the spots on her admittedly small teeth.  Bristles are gentle and never caused any bleeding or irritation.  After trying one successfully, we got the multipack.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are perfect for my toddlers (3 years old).  I like that they are BPA free and made in the USA, they like the nice colors and that they can brush their teeth on their own.  The bristles are very soft, but they last long.  Our first pair lasted 3 months before the bristles frayed with some occasionally chewing from my kids.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is an ok good toothbrush for toddlers.  The handle is about 6 inches long and it&#x27;s contoured.  The grip is OK but not terrific.  The handle is about an inch wide, and about a quarter of an inch thick.  It&#x27;s smooth plastic with no rubber or bumps for traction.  My daughter generally seems to prefer her Oral B tooth brush - maybe because it&#x27;s got a cartoon character on it, or maybe because the grip is larger.  We have toothbrushes in multiple bathrooms to make it easy to brush twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft.  I use one when my daughter is brushing her teeth.  I&#x27;m very glad I don&#x27;t rely on it to get my teeth clean.  It mostly just spreads toothpaste around without scrubbing.  It makes me worry that my daughter&#x27;s teeth aren&#x27;t actually getting cleaned.  It&#x27;s been a long time since I was a child so I don&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s supposed to feel like as a toddler.  Her other toothbrush seems to do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that these are a little bit pricey for what you get.  They come in a pack of three for about 10 dollars.  It would be far cheaper to buy toothbrushes in the store.  When it&#x27;s time for new toothbrushes, I will go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes for my 3 year old...been using them for 2 years now.  Nice soft bristles and the head is the perfect size.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes and refuse to use any other toothbrush but this one.  The head is larger than regular toothbrushes, which allows for better cleaning.  My son is now 4 years old has never had a cavity.  I believe this toothbrush really helped keep his teeth clean and healthy.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have a 2½ yr old that usually hates getting her teeth brushed. The bristles on this toothbrush is very soft and seems to be hurting her less. My issue with this toothbrush is the head is too big for her mouth. It is hard to get the teeth brushed on all surfaces because the head is too big to move around in her mouth. I might try the baby toothbrush and see if it&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> My son has used these since he got his first tooth.  (he started with the infant brush and now uses the 18m and up).  They are very easy to hold for both us to use on him and for him to use himself.  However with teething he certainly likes to chew on them, so we go through them fast.  They are not cheap, but still worth the price.  I know they are safe for my 2 year old, and he can learn to brush his teeth on his own.  Always supervise when using this (or any) toothbrush.  My son has chewed really hard a few times and ripped out some of the bristles (when the molars were ready to pop and his gums were super itchy).  It is not a regular occurrence with these, and I think he just pulled way too hard after biting down on the bristles!</li>
    <li> good size n head shape, dipped in hot water n cool down for extra softness.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my little 18 month old!</li>
    <li> Super soft and perfect for a toddler!</li>
    <li> I love them! Great for my little girls</li>
    <li> My boys (21 months &amp; 3 years) love using this toothbrush.  The colors are fun and the handle is shaped for little hands.  And, of course, you have to love that it is BPA free!</li>
    <li> My 20 month old son loves brushing his teeth every morning thanks to this toothbrush (and our toothbrush song). He can grip it nicely and do forward backward motion with ease. The bristles are soft and seem good quality. The colors are eye catching . Good value for money</li>
    <li> I purchased these toothbrushes for myself being an older adult with very sensitive, soft teeth.  Highly recommend them for any age if its softness you want and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last long for two toddlers. Too expensive for length of use. They flared out after 30 days of use. Nice concept though.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter, 4, was not happy with previously purchased toothbrushes because she said they hurt her gums. She loves these. They have very gentle bristles and her teeth come out bright and sparkly! I would definitely recommend these for all little ones.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles and complete coverage.  We feel that we&#x27;re definitely getting a great cleaning in.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. It is the perfect size for toddler and parent hands, easy for my 20 month old to hold and \\&quot;try\\&quot; to use himself. I also love that it is BPA free and Made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are nice and soft, yet do a good job of cleaning his tiny little teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order again, it is a great value!</li>
    <li> My daughter like them</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, wide and soft and even stand up to my toddler chewing them a bit. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> soft bristles and neat colors.</li>
    <li> I just think that this brush is amazing. It is really soft and easy to use. My toddler does not allowed me to brush her teeth so, I can see that with that brush she can reach most of spaces in her mouth. I do Recommend.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old puts up a fight when it&#x27;s time to brush teeth...every time.  Since I got these there are no more tears.  We both love them!</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes!  The handles are wide enough for my 3 1/2 year old to grip well, making it easier for him to brush his teeth using these vs. the standard kids toothbrushes.  The bristles are nice and soft and the head of the brush is just the right size for a toddler&#x27;s mouth.  The multi pack is very convenient as I have 3 bathrooms in my home and the price was reasonable as well.  Overall I am very happy with them!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is easy to hold and just the right size for my girl. It is soft and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great for toddlers. So far I&#x27;ve bought 2 sets of these. It&#x27;s easier to hold and a great training brush. Bristles are soft. My toddler is excited to brush her team. The colors are cool</li>
    <li> Great for baby&#x27;s first toothbrush.  I wanted an actual brush for my little one&#x27;s teeth - not silicone bristles like many other teething brushes/toothbrushes.  Pediatrician was happy with my choice.  Just note this is a pack of 3 :) Fits perfectly in baby&#x27;s hand, he loves to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is own teeth.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy, soft, and safe!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for my toddler since he was about 18 months. The bristles are very soft and I love the large brush heads, I feel they provide a thorough clean of the teeth which is sometimes hard to get with a toddler who is moving around and not keeping their mouth open.  The 3-pack price is a great deal as well.</li>
