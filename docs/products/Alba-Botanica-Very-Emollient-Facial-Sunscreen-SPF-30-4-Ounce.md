      <li>I enjoyed that it was not greasy ( one of my biggest pet peeves!) and had a decent SPF.</li>
      <li>I loved it at first; it looks beautiful under makeup and works very well to moisturize my dry skin.</li>
      <li>really wanted to love this and</li>

      <li>it is not natural it has several hazardous chemicals!!!</li>
      <li>It settles very well under light makeup also.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and have really liked it.</li>
      <li>The product is one of the very, very that I&#x27;ve found that that doesn&#x27;t cause some sort of skin reaction or rash, although it doesn&#x27;t seem quite as effective as some other.  </li>
      <li>though most of the ingredients are natural or naturally occur</li>
      <li>This is really the first time I&#x27;ve looked into something that I bought for myself.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m applying too much product but the smell really bothers me as well.</li>
      <li>It was soothing, a really creamy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been eating clean for a long time and now that I have two babies under two, I started to really look at ingredients in foods we buy for them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three years now, I have very sensitive skin that breaks out with mostly anything with fragrance and other ingredients.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a teensy bit better than normal sunscreen, but honestly not worth the money.</li>
      <li>really protects my skin from the high ultra-violet here in new mexico.</li>
      <li>He got singed by the grill and the highly flammable sunblock made the fire spread on his skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also very eco-friendly and conscious about the environment.</li>
      <li>This facial sunscreen is effective light and non irritating to skin.</li>
      <li>So I was determined to stay away from products like Coppertone and get something a little more natural.  </li>
      <li>I live in the Bahamas</li>
      <li>It sinks into your skin quickly as well.</li>
      <li>You get a lot for a natural brand I trust.</li>
      <li>I use it on my preschoolers face because he has sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and even some baby sunscreens break me out.</li>
      <li>It does not irritate my sensitive combination skin at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and find that to be true for me as well.  </li>
      <li>It does a lot better than other companies that pour all types of harsh chemicals in everything.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my purse</li>
      <li>Even the super expensive Origins moisturizer with SPF in it doesn&#x27;t come close to how nice a small amount of this will feel on your face.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>This time it seems that the lotion is not as thick as it was originally.</li>

<li> A little thicker then some sunscreens.</li>

<li> The smell isn&#x27;t too heavy or competitive with the fragrance I wear.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three years now, I have very sensitive skin that breaks out with mostly anything with fragrance and other ingredients. I have been using this because this not only doesn&#x27;t break me out, but it gives me the added sun protection. I love it!</li>
    <li> I used this all over my body, not just my face and it kept me sunburn free while out in the sun all day in Southeast Asia.  It didn&#x27;t make me feel greasy like some other Alba sunscreens that I got.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> As an Aesthetician (in training) I am constantly searching for products and reviews to see what will not only benefit me but my future clients. I&#x27;m also very eco-friendly and conscious about the environment. Most people are allergic to two things 1.) fragrances and 2.) preservatives. Avoiding products with both of those things will prevent you from breaking out with acne or hives. This sunscreen is really lovely. I enjoyed that it was not greasy ( one of my biggest pet peeves!) and had a decent SPF. If someone every mentions that they don&#x27;t wear sunscreen because they want to get a tan tell them that you still get a tan with sunscreen minus the damage from the UVA and UVB rays!</li>
    <li> Spreads on easily and protected well.</li>
    <li> A safe and environmentally safe product that keeps my skin protected and moisturized.  Recommended by a friend I now suggest it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and have really liked it. This time it seems that the lotion is not as thick as it was originally. Perhaps they&#x27;ve changed the formula (?).</li>
    <li> The product is one of the very, very that I&#x27;ve found that that doesn&#x27;t cause some sort of skin reaction or rash, although it doesn&#x27;t seem quite as effective as some other.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> I will never buy this product again it is not natural it has several hazardous chemicals!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eating clean for a long time and now that I have two babies under two, I started to really look at ingredients in foods we buy for them. Then I started looking at ingredients in everything we use on our body. This is really the first time I&#x27;ve looked into something that I bought for myself. I live in the Bahamas so I need to wear sunscreen on my face everyday. For my babies I buy Badger because it contains non-nano zinc oxide. Non-nano meaning that it won&#x27;t absorb into the skin and the zinc oxide is the safest to use on babies. It&#x27;s also what&#x27;s in most diaper creams.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this and all the reviews made it sound so lovely being a great non-oily sunscreen that can be used as a moisturizer daily and not clog pores... and I did use it several times and I&#x27;m not going to lie, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used yet. Even the super expensive Origins moisturizer with SPF in it doesn&#x27;t come close to how nice a small amount of this will feel on your face.&lt;br /&gt;When I looked at the back of the bottle to look at the ingredients, my eyes usually scan past the big scientific looking words and go straight to the yummy calendula, aloe, green tea...all the things I know are good for my skin. I decided to look up the bigger words and sadly I didn&#x27;t like what I found.&lt;br /&gt;Even though most of the ingredients are natural or naturally occur somehow doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s effects on us are natural. If you want to know the reason why I&#x27;m not going to use this anymore then I recommend looking up the ingredients you&#x27;re not familiar with on this site: [...] I&#x27;m not going to tell you this product sucks, because it doesn&#x27;t. It does a lot better than other companies that pour all types of harsh chemicals in everything. This is probably the best you can get next to making it at home...which is something I am going to try soon.</li>
    <li> This is a nice non greasy sunblock. Not as \\&quot;light\\&quot; as some, but works well. I use it on my preschoolers face because he has sensitive eyes. Came in a timely manner from seller.</li>
    <li> It was soothing, a really creamy. Good addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily facial sunscreen. It does not feel heavy or greasy, even though I apply a generous amount over a few other facial products (benzoyl peroxide and a moisturizer). It sinks into your skin quickly as well. I have never had issues with makeup looking cakey or patchy when applying over this sunscreen. Definitely something I will rebuy once I am out!</li>
    <li> Beware- there are plenty of toxic ingredients in here if you research them. It&#x27;s still a teensy bit better than normal sunscreen, but honestly not worth the money. Consumers deserve a product that is 100% safe! Felt deceived.</li>
    <li> Great face protection</li>
    <li> I ordered this sunblock based on a recommendation from my neighbor who swears its the only stuff she can use on her face that won&#x27;t cause her to breakout.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and find that to be true for me as well.  My only complaint is its very thick feeling and after a while made my face look greasy/shiny.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear this underneath makeup because of this issue.  I have combination (oily/dry) skin, so maybe that&#x27;s why.  Also, the scent could be improved.  Not looking for something that will attract bees, but just a light, pleasant scent would be nice - especially seeing its a facial product that you apply close to your nose.  However, this sunblock seems to be working the way I need it to, so I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was on EWG&#x27;s guide to safer sunscreens. I loved it at first; it looks beautiful under makeup and works very well to moisturize my dry skin. Unfortunately it started to break me out terribly (tiny pimples everywhere, yikes) and makes my face very red, sore, and warm to the touch a few minutes after applying. Perhaps I&#x27;m applying too much product but the smell really bothers me as well.</li>
    <li> This has a lovely consistency- like a rich but not too greasy lotion. It does not irritate my sensitive combination skin at all. It also doesn&#x27;t leave that whitish cast on my dark skin. I use it in place of my regular face moisturizer (grapeseed oil). It settles very well under light makeup also.</li>
    <li> This facial sunscreen is effective light and non irritating to skin. It spreads well, without white residue to seal with, and does not sting eyes if sweating. I use over regular face lotion, or alone, and it keeps me from getting sunburned every time!</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen and moisturizer in one. Not white and pasty.</li>
    <li> This is repurchase for me. Already tried and love it!  I now use sun screen on my face all year long. Preventing wrinkles is easier than trying to fix them.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is very nice.</li>
    <li> delivered on time in great condition.  it&#x27;s wonderful for my skin.  i could see the difference in only two days.  stays on a long time.  really protects my skin from the high ultra-violet here in new mexico.</li>
    <li> Smooth, non-greasy, working great!  Would order again.</li>
    <li> Nice coverage. A little thicker then some sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it burns my eyes if it gets in them.</li>
    <li> Super great!  Not too greasy.  You get a lot for a natural brand I trust.</li>
    <li> Price is decent for a sunscreen without so many chemicals. I have sensitive skin and even some baby sunscreens break me out. Unfortunately my skin did not like this.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, is vegan and cruelty free! Odorless pretty much and perfect coverage, easy to carry</li>
    <li> I am an avid believer in using sunblock, even during non-summer months, and this sunblock works great.  There was a story on the news recently about a man who wore Coppertone sunblock while barbecuing.  He got singed by the grill and the highly flammable sunblock made the fire spread on his skin.  This man has third degree burns from using sunblock!  So I was determined to stay away from products like Coppertone and get something a little more natural.  This doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch.  I don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s a thick film of product on me. The smell isn&#x27;t too heavy or competitive with the fragrance I wear. Best part is that there was no white residue anywhere after application.  You do have to remember to re-apply this every couple of hours but it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my purse so re-applying does not constitute a great inconvenience for me.</li>
