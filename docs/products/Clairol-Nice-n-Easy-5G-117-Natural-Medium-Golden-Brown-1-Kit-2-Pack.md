<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the color . Looks natural and covers grey hair perfectly . I would absolutely recommend this color to a friend. I have purchased other  dies in the past. They came out streaky. You could tell I coloured my hair. This product doesn&#x27;t donthat</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a very easy product to use went on easy and nice after rinsing my hair felt so soft and smelt good to ! The colors amazing ! I received  this product as a sample and now will be using it as my color choice</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review. Great product to use in a pinch! Normally I go to salon for color treatment, however will not have an appointment for two weeks and I was in dire need to cover some gray. Instructions were perfectly laid out and clearly understood. Product came with a set of plastic gloves - good thing as this can be a messy job! Does stain so be mindful of clothing and your surroundings. I was given this product at no cost, so the shade I received was slightly darker than what I am used to. That&#x27;s okay; I&#x27;ve been wanting to go a few shades darker! :) It left my hair smooth and shiny. I really liked the added ColorSeal Conditioner that came with product. Looking forward to using the conditioner again - really nice conditioner! ***Although product provided at no cost, opinions as stated above are my own.</li>
    <li> Covered my gray and looks fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product complimentary to review and I&#x27;m loving my new hair color!  Came out a couple shades darker then I thought it would but I LOVE it. I only dyed my hair 4 days ago and I will edit my review in 2 months to say how long the color lasted for.  My hair is soft and shinny.  The CC Colorsek weekly conditioner smells amazing therefore my hair smells amazing.  I did not do the 48 hour allergy test, this product didn&#x27;t affect me in anyway.  I do have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product to update my look after turning 40. I am so happy with the way my hair turned out, it looks great. My hair is so shiny,smooth and silky. I was also impressed that for the first time I was actually able to dye my own hair without needing assistance because the directions and application were right to the point!! I was able to test the product at no cost and these are strictly my Personal opinion&#x27;s. Thanks Again Clairol</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample, as part of a testing program, of the Clairol nice&#x27;n easy natural medium golden brown (5G/117).  My natural color is dark blonde so I was a little hesitant to try a color this dark.  However, it&#x27;s winter time and I tend to go a little darker than summer time.  My biggest favorite in doing the color treatment is how soft my hair is!  I didn&#x27;t have much gray before (or just claimed it must be a confused blonde hair).  Whatever I did have is covered now.  Grays, once colored, are supposed to look like highlights, but since I didn&#x27;t have many it didn&#x27;t have quite the same effect.  If you&#x27;ve got grays, try this product (and search for a color you&#x27;ll love - there are lots of options).  If you&#x27;re like me, you might consider trying a Clairol product more suited to a head of hair lacking in gray.  For this particular color, I would agree with the statement on the box - best suited for light to dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> I normally use a level 6 in my hair so I was reluctant to try this color at first.  However since I dye my hair constantly anyways I took the plunge.  I had used Nice &#x27;n Easy back in the 90&#x27;s so I thought I was familiar with this product.  Dying instructions are very standard - there is nothing really new or different here.  After rinsing out my hair and shampooing I opened the &amp;#34;CC&amp;#34; (colorseal conditioner) and applied it.  I was immediately amazed at how silky my hair felt.  When I began to comb out and dry my hair I did not have a single tangle.  My hair felt amazingly healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I also think the color coverage was really great.  I had a good deal of root growth so I could really compare the previously colored area to the new growth. My hair looked evenly covered but the color was not flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I would use this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at no charge but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great color. It covers resistant gray. I love the tones and highlights. I received this color as a tester. I will purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I received it through a testing product and I am so glad I did.  I have been having trouble finding a product that root covers all of the gray.  It worked.  So very happy.  I have now found my go to touch up kit with Clairol.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product, so I thought, &amp;#34;Why not give it a try.&amp;#34; I normally use a different at home color treatment, but I must say that I will be switching to this one. Not only did one box cover my long hair, I really loved the results! It gave my hair some natural looking highlights and my hair actually felt conditioned after coloring it! I think I&#x27;ll try a reddish color next and I can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> I received this as complimentary sample from Influenster for review purposes. Here is my thoughts about Clairol Nice N&#x27; Easy 5G/117 hair color. I&#x27;ve never colored my hair before but I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use with the bottle applicator method. I waited until I had approximately 1/4&amp;#34; of regrowth before I applied the Nice N&#x27; Easy. The resulting color blended well with my previously colored hair. I don&#x27;t feel like this color is multi dimensional however. Clairol describes this hair color to be &amp;#34; Superior natural looking color with tones and highlights&amp;#34;. I would say this color is a natural looking color. I was kind of expecting this shiny multi dimensional luminous color, but what I got seemed to be a more subtle, natural color. The coverage of this cream/gel was excellent, and I can agree with others about the strong ammonia smell. I think for someone looking to cover their greys, this hair color would make an excellent choice. The deep conditioner provided with the color made my hair very soft and manageable without added weight.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with my experience with the Nice &#x27;n Easy product.  I received the product in the mail and was hesitant to use it because I did not think the color was right for me.  Realizing I needed to do something with the gray hair and roots showing, I decided to use the product.  I liked that it was so easy to mix and apply.  The odor was not pungent (pleasant smelling actually) and my boys did not even know I colored my hair because they did not smell the strong odor!  It also did not burn my skin, which has happened with some other products I have used in the past.  The color was a wonderful surprise and I am quite pleased with it.  It is not too dark and the highlights are subtle.  My hair is so soft, silky, and shiny - I love it!</li>
    <li> This was a beautiful color that covers roots very well, as I already had brown color to cover. I was pleased with the outcome and was even told the color was gorgeous by several friends and family members. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great Product, perfect for coloring my grays!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this hair dye. Easy to use and my hair feels so soft!! I loved the natural color. I usually use a more expensive brand but this has won me over. I received this for free from a sampling program and had I not I don&#x27;t know that I would have ever used it. I have long hair and one box covered all of it!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product to test for free. I had never colored my hair, but recently I had a few grey hairs popping up. I was excited when I was chosen for this product. It was very easy to use and apply myself.  I love my new color and how soft it made my hair feel. I will definitely keep this as my go to for covering up my grey and changing my hair color when I want to.</li>
    <li> Super shiny and soft after rinsing.  Seems to have covered my stray grays well.  Pleased with the color.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was very simple to use. Great coverage with product. It left my hair soft. Will definately use it again. The CC conditioner smelled so good and my hair is a lot shinier than it was! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I got a free box from Influenster. Easy to use, but the color they sent was a little too dark for my liking. I will buy again and try a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> Received from a sampling program to try.  Loved it!  Exceeded my expectations of an at home hair color.  Covered my grays and hasn&#x27;t faded in a month.  Highly recommend and would purchase again!</li>
    <li> loved it and it was all for free to try</li>
    <li> I love how the color looked and how soft my hair felt! I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
    <li> I got to try the Clairol Nice n Easy 5G/117 Medium Golden Brown for free.  I absolutely LOVE IT!  It was a pro at covering my grays and the multi highlights made my hair just gorgeous and natural looking. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and the color has not faded and still looks great. I&#x27;ve had many compliments!  So in conclusion, Clairol Nice n Easy is my hair color from now on. The amazing price is just icing on the cake!!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a product to test.  The color was darker than I typically do.  It looked nice and went on easy (nice n easy) BUT it made my head really itchy afterwards.  Not like a allergic reaction, more like dry skin itchy.  Other than that it was great</li>
    <li> This hair color went on nicely and looked great.  It made my hair very soft and smooth.  But, it also left my scalp itchy!!</li>
    <li> I received my free product via Influenster and was excited to try it. The result I would was only okay for me. I would recommend letting the mixture sit a little bit longer than listed on the instruction. I feel that the mixture was a little to light for me (not the product&#x27;s fault, I should have ordered a darker shade). I noticed that the grey hair on my head were a little bit shimmery and shiny compared to the rest of my hair. The difference was very noticeable for me. After just three weeks though, I see grey hair showing again and shiny grey hair got more shiny. Maybe my hair just grows too fast. Overall, it wasn&#x27;t bad. It did not cause any stinging on my scalp at all.</li>
    <li> I liked the color that my hair was dyed. My hair seemed shinier than before the dye. It left my hair feeling soft, too.  I did not find that the color lasted too long before I needed a touch up. It was easy to apply though and did not smell too bad of chemicals. It did not make a big mess which is great when I am coloring my hair at home! I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and dye! It goes on so smoothly and oops proof! And the color is beautiful and makes my hair feel so healthy and look extremely healthy!!! I received it complimentary to test and I love it!!!! ❤</li>
    <li> I have had a hit or miss relationship with Clairol during the year. Overly sensitive scalp and skin even the smallest amount of irritant was enough to have a disaster.  This nice and easy brand is one of the few that I have tried that even pass the small patch test. One can easily see the three tone highlights in already dark brown hair.  Moreover, it does well to hide dry ends with color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary  for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown/black shoulder length straight hair with silver/gray at the roots right in the front. Most, hair color doesn&#x27;t really do much for my gray. I was pleasantly surprised by the scent of the product. It was not strong or overpowering at all. The instructions were clear and concise. It was very easy to use 1-2-3 steps. The gloves were thick and big enough to put on without any struggle. The hair color was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t drip at all! I decided to use the whole 45 mins rather than the 25 mins because I knew I still had previous hair color in my hair. I can truly say that my hair felt so soft and full of body afterwards. The color was a just a tad bit darker than the color indicated in the box but the color worked so well on my grays.. They look like natural highlights! The color looks natural but mutidementainal It definitely brightened up my color and my look. I definitely would use this again and definitely recommend  it!! I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free. My hair I natural medium brown but I had dyed it red. I was offered to try this out for free so I did because I wanted to go back to my natural color. After I used it my hair looked like the natural color. Overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have used a few different boxed colors for my hair before but have never been satisfied with the outcome. Clairon was easy to apply and gave me great coverage and the color came out beautiful. Would recommend to anybody</li>
    <li> I have used Clairol Nice n Easy several times so when I was asked to test this product I jumped at the chance and I was not disappointed at all. Great gray coverage and my hair was left soft and shiny not dried out like some coloring does. Overall great product! Great job Clairol as usual.</li>
    <li> I received Clairol Nice n Easy 5G 117 hair color kit free for in return my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve  been coloring my own hair for years! Had many different hair styles, from super long to pixie short. Colored from plum to black. Its always hard to find a brand that will truly last, let alone look healthy. I wanted to try out a new color so I went with natural medium golden brown. Let me just say this....My husband was impressed!!! My hair color came out so beautiful and shiny!!!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This color was sent to me for free.  The following comments are my own opinion and not an opinion of anyone else.  I love the color and how easy it was to apply.  It does have a strong odor while applying the color but other than that I have no issues with this product and will be purchasing it in the future. It leaves a very nice shade of highlights and over all color.  Completely colored all gray on my hair and left my hair soft and without a newly colored hair aroma.</li>
    <li> I really like the ease of use and results of this product.  I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments and it left my hair super-soft, too.  I will be trying more colors in the future.  Thanks Clairol!  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;(I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> Color turns out like the box pictures. My hair was soft and smelled good after coloring and using the conditioner. I have been trying to cover pink stripes in my hair and this product did a good job and covered most where other products did not.</li>
    <li> Awesome product that was easy to use and didn&#x27;t take a lot of time!  The only con would be the odor was very strong!  My hair looks natural and feels softer than before I started!  The CC conditioner smelled so good like coconut and my hair is a lot shinier than it was!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used a few other hair colors in the past, but have very disappointed in the resulting color and in how dry and lifeless they left my hair. I wanted to cover my grey, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much better results than I&#x27;d had with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleasantly surprised. The color is very natural and attractive and my hair is actually softer than it was before!&lt;br /&gt;Some other details:&lt;br /&gt;- I just colored it a few days ago so I can&#x27;t comment on how well the color lasts yet.&lt;br /&gt;-The application was typical of home hair coloring so it&#x27;s a little messy, but not too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;-It came with the usual once-a-week conditioner, but I found that this one was effective without weighing my hair down. I didn&#x27;t use any of my other usual leave-in conditioners and still had wonderfully soft hair the next day. In the past, the provided conditioner either didn&#x27;t work and I had to use my own conditioners or it left my hair heavy and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;- The smell of the dye isn&#x27;t particularly strong, but it&#x27;s chemical and somewhat unpleasant, so it&#x27;s good that it fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;- My grey has been completely covered, appearing now like very natural-looking highlights! Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free sample of Natural Medium Golden Brown in return for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the immediate results of this hair coloring have been far superior to my previous experiences and I will definitely be repeating this once my grey reasserts itself to an annoying level:)</li>
    <li> I received this as complimentary sample for review purposes. Here is my thoughts about Clairol Nice N&#x27; Easy 5G hair color.&lt;br /&gt; Ive been coloring my own hair for some time now using the bowl &amp; brush method. I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use with the bottle applicator method. I waited until I had approximately 1/4&amp;#34; of regrowth before I applied the Nice N&#x27; Easy. The resulting color blended well with my previously colored hair. I don&#x27;t feel like this color is multi dimensional however. Clairol describes this hair color to be &amp;#34; Superior natural looking color with tones and highlights&amp;#34;. I would say this color is a natural looking color. I was kind of expecting this shiny multi dimensional luminous color, but what I got seemed to be a more subtle, natural color. The coverage of this cream/gel was excellent, and I can agree with others about the strong ammonia smell. I think for someone looking to cover their greys, this hair color would make an excellent choice. The deep conditioner provided with the color made my hair very soft and manageable without added weight.</li>
    <li> I used this as part of a complimentary testing service. I&#x27;ve always used Nice &#x27;n Easy and needed a new color anyway. I really liked the outcome. The brought out my highlights and was as usual very easy to use. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with Clairol products, especially Nice &#x27;n Easy. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Overall this color matched perfect, but didn&#x27;t have the different tones of highlights I usually get from the other Clairol products.  I would use again for gray coverage!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Good coverage and color. Hard to get off skin though so be careful. Otherwise, good product and results for an at home color system!</li>
    <li> This product definitely delivered!! I received this totally free and I was so happy got the exact color that shows on the box and that is very rare! Normally I&#x27;m off by like 5 shades but this one did it! My results was a nice rich color looks like I went to the salon and it gave me soft highlights looks very natural!! Definitely worth the try!!!</li>
    <li> I always color my own hair but this was my first time using this shade and I&#x27;m not disappointed. It&#x27;s easy to mix and apply. It covered my grays and left my hair silky soft which I&#x27;m grateful for bc most make my hair feel brittle. I would def stick with this brand!</li>
    <li> I received this hair color to try and was apprehensive because I&#x27;ve been loyal to another brand. I used it and loved it.  My curly hair came out soft any shiny. My grey roots blended in beautifully. As advertised, I saw highlights in the color (in the sun). It&#x27;s been about four weeks since I colored my hair and the color has lasted almost like the first day. In the Florida sun that&#x27;s usually a problem with other brands. I will most definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> Received a complimentary box to try in the mail.  I have used several other brands in the past.  This one gave me the richest color with nice highlights/lowlights.  Will be using this brand and color again!</li>
    <li> I received a box of Nice n Easy Hair Color 5G/117 Natural Medium Golden Brown free of charge to try out. Although I&#x27;ve used this brand in the past, this was a new color for me. I noticed it left reddish highlights which I didn&#x27;t like, along with difficulty covering my gray.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the color</li>
    <li> I loved the way it left my hair.  It was truly a nice  natural color and it left  my hair  smelling  awesome.  It did  not damage my ends because  I already  have coarse hair it did not make it worst.  Definitely  will use again.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is I had a &amp;#34;Bride of Frankenstein&amp;#34; streak that would make you scream and the Nice n Easy hair color covered my grey completely like a champ. The first thing I noticed using this product, was that it had minimal steps to follow which made the process so much quicker. The smell I did not enjoy, but I didn&#x27;t have to endure it to long and because of the result I got after using the product it made up for the smell. The color for me was wonderful it was a nice rich golden vibrant brown just like it said on the box. I grew up watching my mother use Clairol hair color for years with great results, so it made me more confident to use this product. All in all using this product was a success! I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used nice n easy, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. The color process was simple and fool-proof. My hair turned out so soft and shiny with such nice dimensional highlights. I love the conditioner they provide, and there&#x27;s plenty of it for multiple uses. It&#x27;s been a week now, and the best part of the experience for me was the fact that I haven&#x27;t had any haircolor rubbing off on my towels or clothes...or washing out in the shower. A first for me! I hope this means the color will last longer without fading!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product complimentary, but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to try out and I was very happy with the results. It was super easy to use, the color has held up nicely, covered my grays and my hair looks shiny and healthy.  I will definitely use this product again!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and it had worked very well on my grey hairs. I will definitely use it again.  I tried this product at no cost to me my receiving a vo box from influencer.com</li>
    <li> Great color and great coverage!</li>
    <li> I received this hair color complementary from Influenster VoxBox to review; however, the opinion is mine.  My very favorite thing about this product is the conditioner included - smells nice, does a good conditioning job - wish they marketed it separately!  The hair color and process were about as I expected, and similar to when I had colored years ago, although I have some gray hair now so was able to see the coverage; good.</li>
    <li> Clairol Nice n Easy 5G 117 Natural Medium Golden Brown was sent to me to try free.  I love this product!  I have alot of gray to cover, and it did the job perfectly!  Easy to use, very convenient &amp;#34;in your home&amp;#34; product.  The color turned out better than I expected.  Flecks of gold mixed with the brown.  The conditioner has left my hair so soft, and shiny.  If you are looking for an easy, professional looking home product, this is the one to use.</li>
    <li> I received it through a sampling sight and am very impressed at how well it colored my hair. and I would recommend this to family or even friend that wanna color there hair. This product worked very good for me and I personally loved it. I might even consider buying it in the future if I choose to do my hair again.</li>
    <li> Great coverage - long lasting!</li>
    <li> Received this complimentary. It&#x27;s a nice color and left hair soft</li>
    <li> I like the hair color. I think it tends to not cover the stubborn grays as much as they claim that it does, but maybe my hair just dyes a little differently. I do like the rest of the coverage, and it doesnt leave an ugly flat color.</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely wonderful. It completely covered my grey (which there is quite a bit right in the front of my face) and left my hair soft and very natural feeling. The odor was not overwhelming as I have found with many different products I have used. It is almost like salon quality but way more reasonably priced! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and I am so grateful that I did, as I was extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the simple directions and how simple the product was to use.  This was my first attempt at home to color my hair.  Thank you Clairol</li>
    <li> Eliminating moderately grey in long, dark hair can be quite the challenge. Especially when you have stubborn grey like I do. I recently received Nice&#x27;neasy Natural Medium Golden Brown hair dye complimentary from a sampling site, so these are my own opinions from my experience. The box contained very easy to read instructions, a pair of decent quality disposable gloves and the hair coloring and activating agent as well as a generous tube of conditioning cream. Once mixed, I applied the hair dye in the bottle provided and even had some left over. My hair is very long, down to my waist line. The smell was a bit strong, but not unbearable by no means. I left it in for the recommended 45 minutes for stubborn grey. After rinsing, I applied a good bit of the conditioning cream and it smell so good! After rinsing it out, my hair was incredibly soft and still smelled wonderful. The resulting color is a bit darker than what I expected it would be, but over all, I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it. Thanks Influenster and Clairol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clairol Nice n Easy Products for years.  Recently received this complimentary from Influenster - hadn&#x27;t used this color before.  It was beautiful and made my hair look so shiny. Easy to use.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Truly love this product. I love how it highlights and tones and it isnt harsh on my hair!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for years and recently received this product as a free sample.  I have recently been using the foam versions of different brand hair colors and was skeptical to go back to the old way of coloring my hair but let me tell you that this was soooo much easier than the foam versions and can&#x27;t believe how much faster application was!  The color covered the pesty grays that were starting to sneak through as well as gave me good overall color and shine!  The post application conditioner left my hair silky and smooth!  Love the product and will definitely be leaving those foam style colorants on the store shelves in the future! I did test the product at no cost but this is my truthful opinion of the product!</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample.  I hadn&#x27;t actually dyed my hair myself in years.  The instructions were easy to follow.  However apparently I am a messy person because I got dye all over my bathroom.  I&#x27;m not even 30 and have alot of white hair And this product covered it all. The color came out great and even looks like I have a touch of highlights.  I would definitely recommend it and use it again.</li>
    <li> Came out WAY darker than the box pic. My bangs looked almost black while the rest was a tad bit lighter. However it did not damage my hair at all not did it cause any itching or burning like some products do. Therefore I am rating this a 4.&lt;br /&gt;(My hair was a very light blonde before using this color)</li>
    <li> I received this as an Influenster campaign at no cost. I was excited to receive the product and color my hair. Packaging looked like it had been updated. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t able to color my hair with this product. I have colored my hair many times over my life and have always been instructed to start with dry &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair. So, with that in mind I mixed up the color. Before I started I glanced over the instructions and it said to start with clean damp hair. Since I had already mixed up the color, I wasn&#x27;t able to use the product. It did smell good and the little bit that landed in the sink matched the color on the box.</li>
    <li> For years I have been dying my hair red but I grew tired of it. I wanted to go back to my natural color. I got the 5g/117 thanks to vox box @influenster.com and fell in love with the color. It covered the few grey hairs that were coming in. The high lights looks natural. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the end result was okay, I won&#x27;t be using this again. First, the smell was awful. I had my bathroom door open and was still annoyed by the smell. Secondly, with my long hair it was difficult to see if I was adding the color evenly. As such, my hair ended up darker in the front than the back. Lastly, it was messy. I should have had a friend help, but I think that defeats the purpose of an at home hair color. I&#x27;ll stick with going to my stylist. Less hassle, mess, and smell.</li>
    <li> I loved this product got it as complentary product I have medium blonde hair and I know have a medium brown hair turned out wonderful.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product!  The shade on the box was almost identical to the shade I got...and I have multi-tonal hair and minimal grey.  The product smelled nice and didn&#x27;t burn at all while developing.  The conditioner was outstanding and left my hair feeling soft and touchable.  I would recommend this product highly, and I would absolutely use it again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the product for no cost, but I have not been paid in any way for my review!</li>
    <li> I would have went a little lighter than, but this dye left my hair soft and shiny as the box states. I had no problems or negative feedback to give at all. I was a little worried since my hair is relaxed but it&#x27;s been 2 weeks and no noticeable damage. This product was free and part of a sampling group and all my opions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get to try this out for free! I was excited to get it because I am starting to get a few gray strands here and there, so I dye my hair to cover them. This was somewhat messy to apply, so make sure to be very careful when doing your application. The end result was a very pretty my hair but better shade that looked vibrant and was silky soft! The color hasn&#x27;t really faded out too much either! Worth trying if you dye your hair at home!</li>
    <li> I have never dyed my hair before, this was easier than what I expected to put in, &amp; wash out. I expected to make a mess, but didn&#x27;t! It gave great coverage. I loved IT! I will definitely buy this product for myself! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes!</li>
    <li> I love this! the coverage is great and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about doing the whole box home color kit.  Clairol made it super easy!  The color was easy to mix and apply and my hair was softer and shinier after I applied it.  I would recommend this for a first time user and an experienced user.</li>
    <li> I am normally not a fan of boxed dye kits and choose to have my hair done by my stylist. However this product has made me rethink my stylist options!! This product was easy to use and covered my gray hairs very well. It seemed to have more of a red tint on me than I expected (I am a meduim/dark brown naturally.) The color has lasted about 4 1/2 weeks before my roots started to show, but I also take vitamins to help my hair grow. I highly recommend this product, as I am ready to head out to buy a new kit for my touch up next week!!!  I received these products product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary for testing purposes. I used it as an all over color. I had highlights in my hair and this added a natural blend and highlights to my hair. The conditioner made my hair feel very soft and not damaged like other dyes have made my hair feel. The only issue I have is that because I have long hair I have to use two boxes of this dye instead of one, which is no different from any other dye I have had to use. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally auburn hair but have been coloring it various shades of red, brown &amp; blonde for years.  I decided to let my natural color show through just in time for my grays to come in (boo!).  I have found that other color treatments (OTC and professional) tend to leave my hair with an orange-ish hue after a couple weeks.  I went with the Natural Medium Golden Brown thinking it would &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; the red in my hair.  To my delight it actually enhanced it!  The color was very natural looking and in the sun it has a nice auburn highlight.  Now if your hair isn&#x27;t naturally a similar color obviously you won&#x27;t have that effect but I love it.  It covered my few grays and the conditioner made my hair super soft.  I received this in mail as a free trial but this is my true opinion.  You can see in the picture that the color change is not dramatic but that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a sampling program and was very pleased. I have moderate grey on the top and it covered wonderfully, leaving my hair soft with a great color. I will be buying this product in the future and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> There is such a confusion to picking a brand and color you will be wearing for at least 3 months. The nice&#x27;n&#x27;easy has always been the first choice for me. With precise coverage and natural shine, I trust this brand fully. There is enough product in the box to cover my longer hair. I highly recommend clairol.</li>
    <li> I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.  I thought that this hair color was easy to use and fairly quick.  It only took about 5 min to apply and 25 min to process.  The color was nice, a little more red in the color than i expected but it might be because that is a natural undertone of my hair.  it looks natural which is great, no one has really noticed i colored my hair which is good! :)</li>
    <li> Pretty but messy. The results were gorgeous. It turned out exactly as I expected. However, nicen Easy is messier than other dyes I&#x27;ve used. The cheap gloves slipped and made it tough to control the bottle. The mix was thin and dripped. It&#x27;s a good, economic coloring set but I think I&#x27;ll spend a little more next time on a brand that is easier to use.</li>
    <li> First off, I was a bit nervous to try to color my hair myself, but this Clairol Nice n Easy is just that, easy and nice to use.  The odor wasn&#x27;t too bad, and the results for my first time were great!!  The color turned out a medium brown with tones of chestnut.  Very pretty!  I followed the directions and it wasn&#x27;t too messy, the consistency was kind of thick which was good so it would stay on the hair.  All in all I am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;** I was sent this to use and review</li>
    <li> Great product leaves hair looking healthy and shiny!!! Get alot of compliments from friends!!!!</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is medium blonde so this is quite a bit darker. I have tried many hair colors over the years this one is pretty good. The smell isn&#x27;t horrible. It does hair that dye smell but in my small bathroom with window open it was okay. It didn&#x27;t cause any burning. I used one box on my long hair and it was enough to cover completely. My hair feels extremely soft. It has a nice shine to it. The condition that comes with it smells quite nice and the give you enough for several weeks. The dye mixture was thick enough not to run, which is nice. It does stain your skin quickly and contain chemicals those are to minuses for me. Overall this is a nice product. The color looks natural and makes your hair feel and look healthy. I have a few gray hairs and it covered nicely. I tested this product at no cost, but all my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Loved this color and brand. i received this product as part of a sampling program and was amazed. number 1 best thing....it doesn&#x27;t stink lol. i wanted something to cover my roots from previous colorings growing out. i wanted something like my natural coloring. i was surprised how nicely the color came out and how easily it was done. i was ready to rinse in no time. love that.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used at-home hair color in years, but I wanted to give it a try. My starting color was light blonde and I was worried about the color given the drastic change. It got a little more red hues (given my natural color) but really rich and pretty. The application was quick, just pour one bottle into another, shake &#x27;em up, and apply to dry hair. You have some control over the richness you end up with by how long you leave it on. It comes with a FANTASTIC conditioner for after you rinse and the following weeks. Great, easy experience and nice color!&lt;br /&gt;I got this as part of a sampling program to review at no cost. Opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; Although I usually only buy hair dye with Ash so I don&#x27;t pull red I was very surprised to see that I got the color that it said on the box not much red at all so this made me very happy Also 100 % gray coverage. I have used Nice&#x27;n easy for quite some time this was just a different shade. Love their product. &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was hesitant on trying this product at first. My hair was really red and Faded at the ends and I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would cover and tone the all over look. I applied it root to ends and it turned out GREAT! I really am satisfied with my results. It left my hair feeling great and it also has tons of shine. The color added tons of dimensions and highlights and low lights. I would definitely  recommend this color... The cc cream seems to be working well also. I plan on using it once  week to see if it helps lock in the color and keep it vibrant and shiny.</li>
    <li> I had my mother color my hair for me because I have long hair and when I am coloring my hair I want to make sure I don&#x27;t miss a spot. I use this product in order to brighten up my hair and cover up some of my gray areas. I really enjoyed using this product the directions were super easy but detailed as well, the applicator bottle made it easy to cover all areas of my head and the unique tip made it easier to spread the product around. I really loved the overall smell of the product and I loved how it did not leave my hair feeling brittle but soft and easy to manage as well I would even say that my hair felt softer than before I used this product. I tested this product at no cost, but all these opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I expected the color to be a little too dark for my medium blonde hair but I was surprised that the color is warmer than I originally thought it would be. It&#x27;s a full coverage product and the conditioner was great!  My hair was soft and felt healthier than before using the hair color.  I liked the different tones of the dye.  I received the Natural Medium Golden Brown as part of a testing program and these are my opinions of the product.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying hair coloring at home. I have black hair with highlights that had grown out and mostly dark golden.  Reading the instructions is important. If you need to, perform the allergy test and strand test. The instructions state to mix bottle 1 with 2 and shake well. You do have to discard any remaining liquid. Since my hair is about shoulder length, I decide a bowl and use only half the product.  I mixed equal parts of the color blend formula with the color activator formula and applied to my entire hair in parts. The ammonia smell is pretty strong so make sure your bathroom is ventilated. I left it on for about 25 minutes after I finished the application in less than 10 minutes.  After rinsing and using the provided conditioner which has a nice coconut smell, I blow dried my hair. Since my hair is black, the medium brown color showed up only over my previous highlights. Over all I am happy with the way it turned out. Maybe a shade lighter would have worked better. My hair feels soft and nicely conditioned which is important.  Some tips: Make sure to wear an old t-shirt. Apply vaseline around your hairline and neck to avoid staining during the process. Be careful to avoid splatters.  I received this product for testing purposes at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I loved it!!! It completely covered all the gray and left my hair silky smooth! i will be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I received the product complimentary to review. I have dark Blonde hair and i have wanted to try something new. I absolutely love this color and product! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive a complimentary box of 5G/117 Medium Golden Brown, and was totally satisfied. The application was so easy and my hair just shined beautifully with hints of highlights throughout. I would recommend this product to all my friends and will continue to purchase Clairol hair color.</li>
    <li> As far as covering my gray hair it was a 100% winner hands down. It has great highlights and lowlights, wonderful color all around. It gave my dark brown hair a deep mocha color with the gray being honey brown. I am extremely pleased with the results and would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I had previously colored my hair around 6 months ago. It was fading and my grey hair was showing again.  My daughter wanted to learn how to color someone else&#x27;s hair, so I let her do mine.  The instructions were simple to follow.  The color came out very even and the grey was completely covered.  I received a complimentary sample of this product to review.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair color! It is perfect for grey hair as it treats the grey as a highlight. They also seem to have improved the color scent and it has more of a fruity tone now and the conditioner has also been reformulated and now has a coconut smell. I left the shower with very soft hair and a nice color with some great highlights. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for grey coverage and a nice price.</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me for free to test and review. My honest opinion is that I really liked the product. I was a little skeptic but it really went on nice and was super easy to apply. It covered the few grays that I have and that was nice. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I opened the box and saw the color on the box...I was so afraid the color would be way to dark.  My hair was about 90 percent gray at the time.  I nervously opened the box, read the directions and started the process of coloring my hair.  It was the longest 25 minutes I have spent in along time.  I found the direction very easy to read and understand.  Once I had waited out the time...I quickly did as directed and started rinsing my hair of the dye.  I was wonderfully surprised by the color!!  It looked so natural!  I have received so many wonderful compliments.  I will be buying with color again and keeping up on coloring my hair!  Thank you Clairol Nice&#x27;n Easy for a easy to use product with great results! So glad I was able to try it for free but I will be buying the next box!</li>
    <li> I was asked to test the product and I had great success. There was a 100% grey coverage. It was easy to use. My hair was already highlighted and the product maintained the look of the highlights while uniformly coloring my hair. I was very happy with the outcome especially since my roots were almost 2 inches.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; I received a free trial of this product. It was pretty average as far as use goes, pretty easy. It was a little darker than I expected, but I still love the color. My hubby likes when my hair is dark anyway, so that was not an issue. The gray coverage is great. Love the look and FEEL of it. I have some left over conditioner for another application to make the color and feel last longer.  Has some natural looking variations in color in the light. Overall would definitely be using this product again &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Was given to review, very easy, nice color, pleased with product.</li>
    <li> I love Nice &#x27;n Easy. I&#x27;ve tried many other colors and my hair comes out exactly like the color on the box.I love Nice &#x27;n Easy. I&#x27;ve tried several colors and my hair comes out the color on the box.  It also leaves my hair very soft any shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nice n&#x27; Easy in the past, but recently I&#x27;d been using a more expensive product so I was interested to see how the Nice &#x27;n Easy line compared. I found the instructions easy to follow, but the color and developer were a little runny and very messy. I recommend wearing old clothes and being very careful of drips while you&#x27;re applying the color. I left it on for the extra time for stubborn gray coverage, and it did indeed do  great job covering the gray hair, plus the color had nice highlights, but it also had a little more reddish tones than I usually like in my color. It also left my hair a little drier than usual, so I had to apply an extra conditioning treatment to get it back to looking smooth after I&#x27;d colored it.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s been about 4 weeks now since I colored, and the reds have mellowed out well, plus the gray is just beginning to peek out at my part line where my hair is growing out. This color has lasted so far better than what I was using, so I&#x27;m happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product as part of a sampling program at no cost, but all the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Darker than I usually like, but covered my grey very well.</li>
    <li> I received the dye as a sample to try.The dye is super easy to apply. I was skeptical of box dyes since I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past, but I am very impressed with the color. My looks like it was done professionally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge Clairol fan and as usual this color didn&#x27;t disappoint! I started out strawberry blonde, but wanted to go darker for the colder months. The instructions were simple as usual and even after a week my hair is still soft and shiny. I will continue to be a Clairol fan and look forward to my next coloring as the weather gets warm again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost, but will definitely purchase next time!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and good color</li>
    <li> I received Clairol Nice n Easy 5G/117 Natural Medium Golden Brown product as part of a sampling program. I was really impressed with the ease of doing this by myself. The color turned out great! I love the highlights. It gave me a salon look. I will definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> The coloring experience was extremely drying to my hair. The dye was too harsh on my hair and made it very brittle.  The swatch on the box and color  outcome were approximately a 97% match.  Very pretty shine and shimmer but  for only approximately 14 days. My gray wisdom highlights were back and showing way too soon.  I did however love the tube of Colorseal Conditioner that was part of the box.  If the condition would be available in the stores for individual purchase I purchase and enjoy. I was able to try this item at no cost and all of these opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample for a program. When I got the Box though hair color was burst all through it. But after buying a box I really liked it. It does have a stronger odor but not overpowering like some.</li>
    <li> I liked this clairol nice n easy, it has really easy to follow instructions.  After applying the hair color and rinsed my hair with the conditioner included in the box, there&#x27;s no stinky chemical smell and my grey hair was covered with the hair color, it has a highlighted effect.  I love the color effect of this on my hair and the no unpleasant smell is a plus.  I would use this product again and recommend this to people with grey hair.  I tested this at no cost but this review is my own opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I found easy to use and loved the color. I have naturally darkish brown hair with a good amount of grey around my face and it colored nicely with a bit of a highlight look to it. They grey was completely covered. I am happy and so is my hubby, even though he liked me the way I was lol. I received this at no cost to me but all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply like most dyes, not too runny. I thought the color could have been more vibrant but it&#x27;s not bad per say. It&#x27;s just a wee bit flat.</li>
    <li> I received this Clairol Nice&#x27;n Easy hair color as a free sample from Influenster. I am always leery about dying my hair myself. The process was very easy. The directions were clear and easy to understand. The color is accurate with the box examples too. It covered my grays really well. I love how it made my hair feel soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product complimentary to review. I&#x27;ve used  Nice N Easy for years so I was excited to try this color. Although  only kept it on for a few minutes the color was nice and it covered gray well. I did however have some scalp irritation and ended up washing it out early.</li>
    <li> It was a complementary product that I received. It went on easily, and stayed. I have no complaints other than if you have long hair, [mine is down to my rear end] you will need more than one box!! :) Pretty great product all in all though!!</li>
    <li> This hair color product was very easy to use with simple instructions. After using the product with the conditioner that comes in the box, my hair was left feeling softer and more healthy then it has in a long time. I would definitely recommend this hair coloring system.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy. The color stays vibrant after many days.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. It was easy to use. It didn&#x27;t smell great and made a mess but that is a given when using any kind of hair dye so that part was expected.  The color came out really nice and i got compliment on it.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for awhile now.  I am just in my mid 40&#x27;s and do not fill like having gray hair.  This was the first time to use Clairol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I really was impressed.  It has been about 3 weeks since I used it and it still looks good.  I will be using this again in a few weeks.  Have to keep the look going.</li>
    <li> I was provided this product as a sample to use and review.  I really liked it and I will buy it next time I need to color my hair.  The color is beautiful and my hair actually seemed healthier after using it.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, great natural looking and easy to take care off</li>
    <li> Great hair color.  Did a great job of covering my gray and left my hair shiny and vibrant. Color did not fade</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the color results, but I received a free box of Clairol Nice n Easy 5G 117 Natural Medium Golden Brown and decided to roll the dice and see what the color would offer-- I am happily surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying the product and waiting long enough for the color to set, I rinsed, conditioned and styled my hair as directed. I am beyond pleased with the color-- It is rich and shiny, soft to the touch and gives my hair a new life. It is a bit darker than I had hoped (my hair is naturally dirty blonde/very light brown), but it is a luscious brown that definitely works with the winter season.</li>
    <li> I have used Nice n Easy in the past. I find it very reliable and always gives full coverage. It gives a natural looking color without the expense of going to the salon. We all want to get pampered at the salon, but sometimes $150 is not going to happen.  I loved this color. It is a little darker than my natural shade but it looks completely natural and it is great how easy it is to use. I tested the product free of cost, but the opinion I gave is completely my own.</li>
    <li> I originally have medium brown hair with lighter highlights with significant grays throughout the roots. My hair length is top of the shoulder. The process of mixing and applying this hair dye is just like most others. Some are easier than others but I would say this one is average. There was a strong odor at first but it dissipated soon. Applying the dye alone to yourself is not all that easy so I suggest having help with the back if you are a beginner. The dye looks very dark in the bottle so don&#x27;t be alarmed. There was no adverse reaction like itching or burning. Rinsing the dye out was as usual. If you have not done this before it does take a few minutes of continual rinsing to get all of the product out. The CC conditioner smelled nice and it left my hair so soft it was almost too soft but that only last until the next day. The rinsing out of the conditioner is quicker if you do it with cold water. I like that there is extra conditioner left over so I can use it to prolong my color. The initial impression of the color was so dark but after my hair dried it wasn&#x27;t as dark. It did give me the desired effect was to cover grays and give me a one hair color application. This brown I would consider dark brown and not medium golden brown but it is still a nice color. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the gray coverage was. I have quite a bit of stubborn grays that are hard to color and I&#x27;m not old enough to have gray hair. I would purchase this product however I&#x27;m going to try a lighter brown next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product free for testing but all opinions and reviews are my own.*</li>
    <li> I have tried several different hair dyes in the past. This one was different it looked natural. Made my hair feel great. It doesn&#x27;t have that overwhelming smell. It comes with easy to follow directions. I would definetly use it again. I received this at no cost to do product testing.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use store bought hair color because I&#x27;ve always been afraid of a negative effect and that is far from what I got with this product. It was so easy to use that I did it myself with no problems at all. My hair felt soft and rejuvenated after I had finished. I can&#x27;t wait to get out and show off my fabulous new hair color that is perfect and looks like I paid a salon professional a bundle but did it in my own bathroom. I&#x27;m so glad that I got to try this amazing product as part of a testing program and I didn&#x27;t have to pay anything but my opinion and experience was all my own. I would suggest this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I did have dark blonde hair with highlights and was offered to try Clairol Nice n Easy 5G 117 Natural medium golden brown as a tester.  It was easy to apply but messy so make sure you are wearing old clothes and have towels that you don&#x27;t mind getting permanently stained.The smell was really strong it choked me a couple of times so best to have a fan running.  All I had to do was wait 25 minutes and rinse, dry and style. It came out more of a reddish brown than a golden brown. I would recommend this product for the effectiveness of the color. I did contact Clairol on how to change it to a more golden brown but have not had any contact yet.  I attached some pictures of before and after. I did receive this for free to test and all my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Left my hair the perfect color and super soft and silky. I will definitely use this product from now on.</li>
    <li> I was able to test this product at no cost, This is the most natural my hair has looked after coloring it. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow! Great gray coverage and I love this color! It&#x27;s so vibrant! Thanks clairol!</li>
    <li> I received this hair color product as part of a sampling program to try it out. The application steps are just like any other hair color brand. However, there&#x27;s strong ammonia smell while applying. It stung my eyes and burned my sinus. I had to squint during the application process. The formula doesn&#x27;t drip and the color is pretty, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you are sensitive to ammonia smell.</li>
    <li> I received this haircolor as a part of a sample program and I am very happy with the results that I got. The smell was not overpowering and it was easy to use. It left my hair so soft and shiny. I am more than satisfied with the way my hair turned out it looks so natural.</li>
    <li> I received product as part of sampling &amp;#62;i colored my hair by myself .shade is little to dark for me but still a great shiny color.very easy to use .I used entire box for my hair .Color is very nice ,very good product and easy to use,l eaves hair shiny and soft and smells nice</li>
    <li> I received Clairol Age Defy Color as part of a test/sample product and I am totally satisfied with my results. It has left my hair soft, manageable with no gray. I had minimum gray and now I have none. I am very happy with the results of this product and I intend on using it from now on. For all first timers, be careful and read all instructions. Step 1 was new to me and I almost missed it without reading them. I love  Clairol!!</li>
    <li> I got this product free from Influenster to try and I love it .. It was so easy to use,  stayed on my hair without being drippy and covered all my grey. The color was very natural looking not harsh or fake and my hair is very soft and feels great.  Will definitely use this again</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about haircolor in a box because my first thoughts were how can something from a box that&#x27;s not out of the salon really give me the results I want? After receiving a free sample I gave it a try and it blew my mind. Salon Like results In my own home it blends in nicely very pigmented I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this hair color. I got this as a test sample and at first wasn&#x27;t too sure about if the color would be too dark. I think this is a great natural looking color. My hair doesn&#x27;t look at all like it was dyed and it feels silky smooth. The conditioner that came with the dye made my hair feel like silk with the smallest amount. I will definitely be buying this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I have recently tried this nice and easy product at home and found that it is a great product.  This was my first experience using nice and easy, but I am sure now it will not be my last.  This at home hair coloring covered completely and left my hair feeling soft and manageable.  This is a must try at home hair product.  No need to have a friend over to help, this is a do it yourself rainy day experience.</li>
    <li> I received this to try as part of sampling program. I was a little nervous to try it out since I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in so long but I am very impressed with results. It gave me just the look I hoped for our want too dark and it had a little hint of red. So pretty. I am pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Love the color and the price. You get more for your money with clariol i recommend this product to all. if you want color and highlights in the same box clariol is your hair color. i been spreading the word i prefer this to any other haircolor i have tried . Amazing results inbetween salon coloring.&lt;br /&gt;Once you try you too will be pleased.with his product .</li>
    <li> I love how this product covers my gray hair. I also love how soft my hair is after I use the conditioner that is included.</li>
    <li> Received this for free to test. I&#x27;m pretty inexperienced with hair color but this was easy to use. The color came out a little inconsistent and darker than expected, but that might have been my fault. Love love love the conditioner!</li>
    <li> I got this product from Influenster Clairol VoxBox&lt;br /&gt;I love using Clairol products and was happy to try this new color for my self of the Natural Medium Golden Brown hair. This product is great and made my hair feel soft, and was easy to use. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am pretty impressed.  I haven&#x27;t colored in a while so this came out really nice.  I like the gray coverage and the conditioner it came with is AWESOME!  Also, the smell is really good.  Usually you die coloring your hair from this smell but not this one.  I have to admit I had to have the old army towel handy.  I was able to apply this by myself, which never happens and still was able to cover my entire head.  Very please with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was tested at no cost, but all the above opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love the color on my hair. It was very easy to use and it didn&#x27;t get me all dirty. I like the fact that you couldn&#x27;t really smell the dye. The conditioner smelled so good and left my hair wavy.I would recommend this product.I test this product and my first time every use it.I got good results.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.  It blended my previous highlights with my emerging gray and natural brown color.  The result is very natural looking and my hair is soft!  I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Clairol Nice n Easy is amazing! Not only is it better to use this product because it&#x27;s gentler on my hair than other products I had previously used but the various colors they have to better suit your needs is awesome! I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand and this one always tops the chart for me! I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair felt soft, silky and smooth when I used this product. It was very easy to use the Clairol Nice&#x27;n Easy 5G/117 Natural Medium Golden Brown.  I like how it uses 3 tones in one step to give my hair highlights and made it look more natural like a salon would do especially since I have highlighted my hair for years. This was very easy to use with no harsh smells which made it nice. I would recommend this product!  I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this to in the mail to use and review. I love the natural golden brown color and how silky it left my hair. My hair looks healthier then before I colored it. A big plus for me is that it didn&#x27;t leave that strange just colored smell that I get with other hair dyes. I will definitely buy and use again.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a survey program and love this product. This color blended perfectly to my natural hair color and covered all the grey&#x27;s perfectly! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good at home hair color.</li>
    <li> i was sent this product for testing/review. but all opinions are my own. very nice color coverage. this is the brand i always reach for when looking to color my hair at home so when i saw that this was the brand i was testing i was very pleased. for me personally the color last longer than salon colorings. i love the conditioner they include it smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and shiny. overall a great product. the only reason it didnt get 5 stars from is is because of the smell of the color itself.</li>
    <li> I received this color as a promotion to try and review. I used the product as directed and the results are pretty good. I still have some gray that show through but it is only noticeable to me. This product was easy to use and the color is pretty close to what is on the box. Overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Clairol has been in the &#x27;hair business&#x27; for years.  I remember my Mom using Clairol products when I was growing up (and that was years ago!).  Given their history, it is no surprise that their knowledge of hair, its maintenance, and what the public wants is a cornerstone of the hair industry.  I found Nice n Easy to be just that.  Nice:  Did what it promised.  Covered my greys, gave great color coverage, and left my hair soft and smooth.  It also seemed to add &#x27;volume&#x27; which I found to be a nice feature.  Easy:  This word says it all.  Went on easy, rinsed easily.  All in all, you can&#x27;t ask much more for a hair coloring product than being &#x27;nice&#x27; and &#x27;easy&#x27;.  Bravo Clairol!</li>
    <li> I use this on the bottom part of my hair and I frost the top, just to keep coloring in it so it&#x27;s more of a put together look. I love this darker color, as it is a natural color and compliments my hair color nicely!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have naturally light brown hair.  Now that I&#x27;ve used this product I love the darker color.  The instructions for this product were so easy to follow.  It was so easy to use this product and I love the results.  After using the product I love how soft my hair is and that it looks natural.  I will continue to buy this product and I will recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Having used other nice and easy products before, I knew I would get the same great results with this one when it came in the mail for me to test and review.  I was not disappointed.  It worked exactly as it should covering my greys, making my hair soft and the tones and highlights were great.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this product to see if it would cover up all of my gray hair I have been getting without paying salon prices.  I was very happy to see that it does!!  I decided to wait a few weeks to write the review to make sure that the color would hold, and other than a few new grays popping up, it kept all the grays covered.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  Very easy to use also.  I did get this product to test at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product and it&#x27;s so easy to apply and it&#x27;s true to color ... I will def buy again in the future</li>
    <li> Great coverage with product. It left my hair soft and silky. Will use it again. The color came out close to my natural color</li>
    <li> Excellent hair color. Went on smooth and easy to apply, excellent shade. True to color on box. Makes my hair look and feel fresh and soft!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  I applied it myself without any issues.  The smell of the solution and conditioner are pleasant.  The color came out very even and the solution did a great job covering up my grey!!</li>
    <li> I received  this product on a complimentary basis.  I tried the product and it&#x27;s great.  I have a lot of thick hair, and the box was enough  to dye all my hair which is great and it left my hair very nice.  Not dry at all.  I do like that I paid nothing and now my hair is a wonderful color  brown.</li>
    <li> received this product as part of a sampling program, all opinions are my own. The hair dye worked great! Covered my grey and left my hair feeling soft and shinny... r</li>
    <li> It goes on easily and washes out quickly. The color warm brown with red highlights, but that could be my natural hair. Product is great to use.  Color is too dark for my personal preference.fyi, clairol and influencer sent me the color so I could try it.</li>
    <li> This was the first time coloring my hair in 12 years.  I have light brow hair with no highlights. After doing the strand test (VERY IMPORTANT) I mixed the bottles and went to town using the tip of the bottle to split my hair to apply. The liquid was thick and I did not notice any dripping. However, the smell was enough to knock you on your rearend. It was so strong it made my eyes water. That alone made me want to quit but I was already a few strands in so there was no going back now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finished I waited the time on the clock (26 minutes) and promptly added water, lathered and rinsed. The smell is still my hair after 4 washes.I also didn&#x27;t like the lowlights/highlights.I felt they left my hair orange and brassy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,I would not by this again...and makes me wish I had never done it. I did receive this product for free to test out but all opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> As I get older I am finding that I need to dye my hair on a regular basis to hide unsightly grays! I have tried many different brands of hair dye and I was considering going back to paying outrageous amounts at my salon when I was sent a free box of Nice and Easy to review. The following opinions are my own. This color in particular was a lot darker than I anticipated, but it was very pretty and natural looking. I loved that it was not a uniform color, but rather a mixture of many different shades of brown. If it was just a touch lighter I would make it part of my regular hair program. It did the job though and covered these nasty grays. About two weeks after application I started to notice some grays popping back up, but that is normal for my hair. Also worth mentioning is the conditioning and volume effects of this dye. My hair looked and felt great after dying, instead of feeling brittle and dry. I would definitely try out a lighter shade of Nice and Easy!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Covers great and left my hair soft and silky. Also easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I received Clairol Nice&#x27;n easy from Influenster.com to try and review. I received 5G/117 which is a Natural Medium Golden Brown color. I have blonde hair longer than shoulder length so I wasn&#x27;t sure one box would cover it all. When I went to mix the color it did have a strong smell to it but didn&#x27;t seem so strong after I applied it. I followed the instructions which are much like the others you would purchase so it is very easy. It seemed darker in the bottle but after I rinsed my hair it wasn&#x27;t so dark. Having blonde hair I wasn&#x27;t so sure I wanted to have dark hair. I applied the conditioner which did have a nice smell to it. I only wish the company would add a bigger tube to the box. Some people have longer hair than others. It would really be nice if they had extras just for extended use. I was satisfied with the color. It did cover the grey as I expected. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Using this product was my first experience with coloring my own hair. I received the color as a sample and was very impressed. I usually go to a salon to have my hair done so I was a bit nervous of how difficult it would be to do on my own. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it actually was. It added a nice richness to my hair that I really liked. I will absolutely be using this color again.</li>
    <li> I love the way it looks. It has a great shine and my hair feels soft. It has dimensions, it is not flat. I would definitely use this color as a staple now.</li>
    <li> I love the color that this gave me! I have dark brown hair and it made it richer and have more dimensions in it. Highly recommend this if your doing your hair at home.</li>
    <li> I wanted to color my hair to cover my first few grays and just to brighten it up overall.  My husband assitted me and we mixed the product easliy by following the instructions included.  It covered it well and we set the timer and I followed the rinsing instructions.  I am very happy with the result!  Not only did it cover those greys - but I love the way it worked with my natual hightlights!  I was fortunate to be able to test this product at no cost - but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am a hair color newbie and I was very nervous that I would destroy my own hair after reading horror stories. This product was VERY easy to use and really spelled out every step. My hair was shiny and didn&#x27;t end up looking fake - just enhanced. I received a sample to review, but all opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free.  Thank you Clairol.  I have never tried this product before. I have dark/ medium brown hair with about 15% grey. The product was easy to mix, but the odor was strong.  It was also a bit messy.  I think if the solution was thicker it would be better. That being said, my hair turned out soft and seems smoother.  I am not sure why but I like it.  The color turned out just a bit different than described.  My hair now has some red tones in it. A little more than I like actually.  I have gotten compliments on it however. This does give me an idea of what color to choose next time to achieve the exact color I want.  Over all I liked the product and results.  I would advise someone with dark hair that it will be slightly red. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> when first mixing color, it appears darker than the shade should be. the color does lighten up when applied. there is an odor as with any color but quickly dies off. you must rinse dye out thoroughly with many rinses. it is easy to use at home hair color. as with any dye, it is time consuming, but worth it. great color! leaves hair soft not dry. would use this brand again. i received at product at no cost to test, review is 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Great product...color looked good and it was easy to remove from my scalp since I still make mistakes here and there :)   FYI - I tested the product at no cost, but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> oh how I love the texture, shine factor now, and the vibrant color! Also I really like the gray coverage. I have several little fuzzy baby gray hairs, and they always are color resistant. NOT this time! They blended perfectly, and held fast to the color. Yay! I was given this Product of part of a testing program, but my rating is based on my own experience and personal opinion. I will be buying again soon.&lt;br /&gt;This product is good for: Made My Hair Feel Soft, Tones &amp; Highlights, Natural-looking Color, Gray Coverage, bouncy and conditioned</li>
    <li> I received the product for free to try out. At first the strong smell was overwhelming and felt extremely tingly on my scalp. The color was more red than I&#x27;m used to as well. I always use a medium golden brown on my hair from various brands and this was definitely the most red toned that I have used in some time.</li>
    <li> as far as home hair color goes, this is okay.. i guess im spoiled to the pros.. this didn&#x27;t do much to my natural color and i feel like it all washed out within a week or so</li>
    <li> Loved the color and very easy to do at home without having to go and pay salon prices. That&#x27;s probably the best part about it.</li>
    <li> Love the product but will choose a different shade next time.</li>
    <li> I usually use another brand but I tried Clairol this time and it was outstanding.  My hair was soft, healthy looking and feeling but most of all Clairol covered the gray!!  I didn&#x27;t see the usual gray hair around my ears after coloring my hair.  In my opinion it is the best at gray coverage.  It was easy to use and the results were really amazing!  I will definetely be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I received this particular Clairol Nice n Easy color free of charge to try out. I was not very impressed with the root coverage or the longevity of the vibrancy. My roots actually turned a lighter orangish color rather than a brown which was the desired look.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I got a free sample from influenster and it won my heart. I plan on buying this on a basis now. It leaves your hair looking so smooth and soft</li>
    <li> This was the first time I used this product and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it. The final color was great and it covered every part of my hair, I didn&#x27;t have any issues applying it. This has been one of the best hair dye products I have purchased. This is the first hair dye I buy that includes a conditioner and it was great. I would definitely try it again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I received the product in a sample box. I&#x27;ve never colored my hair myself before. It was super easy and I love the ending result</li>
    <li> I love this color!  Works great!  Received a free box to try and I was thrilled with the results!</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use.  It was my first time dying my own hair on my own and was able to gain full coverage with ease.</li>
    <li> I received this to try through Influenster, and am usually a big fan of Clairol and the 6R. However, the brown I used had a really strong odor that I haven&#x27;t encountered before with this product. It left me feeling as if maybe it was just a bad batch, as when I went back to my 6R, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as strong. It covers gray great, but...</li>
    <li> It was a great match! Loved it!!</li>
    <li> Got this product complimentary as part of a sample program, but all opinions are my own. This product is easy to use and yields a fabulous color.  It matched my roots very nicely and the smell was not overwhelming or awful.   The conditioner made my hair feel so silky.  This will definitely help me keep my hair pretty while my budget it tight and salon visits are out of the question.</li>
    <li> love it! easy to use and completly covers the grey. Would highly recommend this product. Directions on the box are easy to understand.</li>
    <li> This worked wonderfully with my natural high lights and low lights to provide a rich set of tones throughout my hair. The color was nice and deep without being too red. The conditioner that was included made my hair feel incredibly silky and healthy. Also the shine in my hair is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product to sample, without charge. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> After receiving Clairol Nice n Easy hair color as a sampling to test, I was amazed at the gray coverage. It took less time and less money to cover my gray than it does at a beauty salon yet the results were identical. It was easy to use. The color went perfect with my natural brown hair so much so that no one realized I had recently colored my hair. Great product, great value.</li>
    <li> I received  this product free to review, and it couldn&#x27;t  have come at a better time.  My son was complaining that I had alot of silver in my hair (he&#x27;s 6).  So I used it and all the silver is gone.  My hair looks and feels great! It was easy to use.  This mom is now happy to have the silver gone.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Nice &amp; Easy since I was in my teens.  At first I would color my hair just for fun and I played with the many hair colors.  Now...well...NOW I choose to color my gray hair.  I received my sample box of Nice &amp; Easy Medium Golden Brown and I used it to cover my resistant gray hair.  I must say, I did leave the hair color a tad bit more than the recommended time and it resulted in excellent gray coverage! For being an at home hair color I am quite pleased with my stubborn gray now a soft smooth shade of medium golden brown. I do love the scent of the conditioner and how soft it makes my hair feels.</li>
    <li> Color is pretty true to results pictured on the box. Unlike most other dyes i&#x27;ve used, this one didn&#x27;t burn my scalp nor leave it itchy. This was definately a plus! Love the multi tones it left in my hair. Now to see how long it lasts. I definately recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> This product works great at coloring gray. I have been using it for over a decade. It comes with a conditioner. Use it one week  after coloring.it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
    <li> I received my box of Clairol for a free trial from Influester. I&#x27;ve colored my hair a few times before but not with this particular brand. I was surprised how easily my hair absorbed coloring mixture which meant no dripping. The smell is not too strong either like with other products which I was really grateful for. While the color took very well, I wish there was more of it. I have a lot of thick hair and I think I&#x27;d probably need two boxes next time. I think it would have asked the color to come threw more brightly. Over all I was pleased and would recommend the product to others.</li>
    <li> I received this as a complimentary sample for review purposes. I followed the directions exactly as they were presented. I am happy with the color and ease of use, but I am extremely unhappy that the product burned my scalp. I did a test before proceeding, and I had no reaction. There was an extreme chemical smell to the product that left me having a hard time breathing during application--yes, I was in a well-ventilated area. I actually was unable to keep the product on for the complete time because it was burning my scalp. I have colored my hair many times before, and I have never had such a negative, painful experience.</li>
    <li> I really like this color left my hair soft and shining and the color looks greatðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    <li> It was so easy to use and did not have that typical at home color smell. It covered my gray perfectly and gave my hair such shine and dimension. Loved it.</li>
    <li> Nice n Easy did a great job covering the grey, and the color blended in nicely. I just wish it didn&#x27;t smell so strong. I hope to use it again in the future!</li>
    <li> I love this product it helps get rid of the gray and makes my hair feel healthy agian</li>
    <li> i love this product...it made my hair feel soft and so much better.. i left it feeling great. i got this pruduct as a sample to try and review with my own words.. thanks clairol for this great product i love it</li>
    <li> it was great. first time i colored my hair. feel 10 years younger. very easy to use and the results are great. love this product</li>
    <li> Great for covering grey hair and so easy to use!</li>
    <li> I received a box of this free of charge to try and review. I have only used clairol a few times in the past but now i remember why. I liked how my hair felt soft and healthly after use. My only use is that i wish it was more creamy than liquidy. It makes a bit of a mess because it&#x27;s so liquidy</li>
    <li> This haircolor was simple to apply.  The smell was average.  Color on box was very close to shade my hair came out after finished.  I have lots of gray hair &amp; this covered it completely.  It&#x27;s been 2 weeks &amp; the color is still bright.  My hair felt nice after coloring.  I would purchase this brand &amp; shade in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this was sent to me to test/review complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> This hair color is amazing, covers all grey hair and stubborn roits will definitely buy again and recommend to fruends</li>
    <li> Received this to test for free. I Loved this color! True color. Covered gray well too.</li>
    <li> Love this color!  So natural and covered all of my grey.  My hair feels so soft too!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant when I saw &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; in the color.  Usually that means that my hair will turn red.  But I thought, what the heck, it is Winter and reddish tones are popular now so I used it.  I have to say that there was no &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; issue.  The color is the color of my natural hair when I was in High School!!  That makes it a  little darker than I would like for my age now(71), however it is fine.  It definitely covered the gray very well and the color is lasting much longer than usual.  Maybe because it is closer color to my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;As always with Clairol my hair is nice and soft and I would certainly buy this product again.  Thank you so much for letting me try it free.  At my age even hair color is a luxury.</li>
    <li> i loved it and will recommend this to all my friends my hair feels healthier and it covered my grey thank you to the people who sent it for review</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a boxed dye, as I usually have my hair done at a salon, but I received this box as a sample, and decided to take a chance.  So glad that I did! I feel like my hair came out softer and silkier then it does with my salon that uses Wella products.  Even my split ends seem less noticeable.  I have a little bit of gray around the temples, and this covered it up fine, and in fact it seems to have some extra &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; in the light were my gray was, which I really enjoy.  As long as this color lasts (it&#x27;s only been a few days!) then I can see myself finally making the switch from salon to at home hair dye!</li>
    <li> I recently received this as part of a testing package and really enjoyed how it turned out. Not only did the color stay it also made my hair softer</li>
