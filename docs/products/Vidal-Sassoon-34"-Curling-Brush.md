      <li>Just love it.</li>
      <li>Oh how many times have I burt my fingers on curling irons, this one does not.</li>

      <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
      <li>It satisfied my needs.</li>
      <li>It adds a nice smooth finishing touch to my hairdo.</li>
      <li>The knob at the top turns easily and the bristles fall out.  </li>
      <li>and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast and gives good style and body.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>In addition, it is easy to pack for travel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and store.</li>
      <li>The bristles also break easily.</li>
      <li>, how ever this one doesn&#x27;t turn on easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to replace an old 3/4\\&quot; hair brush which I had for many years before it stopped working, the Vidal Sassoon 3/4\\&quot; seemed to be a good replacement</li>
      <li>I was very happy to receive this item as my old one was about six years old and had started to lose some of the \\&quot;brush teeth\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It is also great for short hair.</li>
      <li>It is very convenient and easy to use!  </li>
      <li>It is rough on the ends of the brush, does not feel good to the scalp, but heats ok.  </li>
      <li>The curling brush does a good job of the actual curling, but I do find that my hair often gets caught in the teeth .  </li>
      <li>hair is short and it still makes a good style.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But within 3 days of no complaints, I knew I had purchased the right one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another reason I love it is that I don&#x27;t burn myself like a regular curling</li>
      <li>- I just have to be aware of its idiosyncracies.</li>
      <li>I love this curling brush, I wanted the smaller size, but tried this one</li>
      <li>in a pinch - I wanted the hot air brush and thought this would suffice.</li>
      <li>so this particular curling iron is just the ticket!  </li>
      <li>My wife loves this model, Thanks.</li>
      <li>I expected better from Vidal Sassoon.   </li>
      <li>Thanks for stocking them,</li>
      <li>I will look more carefully before ordering another curling brush,.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
      <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this curling brush for my mother who is 80+ years old and very outspoken when it comes to gadgets like this.</li>
      <li>nothing came close,as my hair is very soft, like baby hair.</li>
      <li>this one does not get hot enough, and the brushes slide out.  </li>
      <li>I was dissapointed that the new one has hard plastic combs; whereas the old one had a more rubbery one.</li>
      <li>[...] Just what my Wife was looking for she had a old vs 123</li>
      <li>So far.</li>
      <li>I wanted to replace my old Vidal Sassoon curling brush, which I&#x27;d had for close to 20 years.  </li>
      <li>but it is about 15/20 years old.</li>
      <li>I ordered this brush to replace my old VSW curling brush.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because the cord wore out on my old one, and I couldn&#x27;t find a new one of the same model in the store.  </li>
      <li>Most of the bristles have already broken off.</li>
      <li>It is a huge disappointment, the stores are stocked with hot irons&lt;br /&gt;but</li>

<li> Most of the bristles have already broken off.</li>
<li> It is a huge disappointment, the stores are stocked with hot irons&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
<li> Also the tip or cap on the end is loose and I can&#x27;t tighten it.</li>
<li> The iron takes too long to heat up and the heat isn&#x27;t what I have had from other Sassoon curling irons.</li>
<li> Now I have wide gaps and have been burning my hand.  </li>
<li> Not too big and not too small in diameter for my medium length hair.  </li>
<li> &amp; the tip that is not hot,</li>
<li> That may be becuase they do slide out, as other reviewers have said.  </li>
<li> To me it is not worth half of what it cost.  </li>
<li> I had my previous brush for about 4 yrs before the teeth started to break off.</li>
<li> or I don&#x27;t want as tight a curl.</li>
<li> but every few months I have to order another one since the little black plastic things break off little by little.  </li>
<li> and I have gone back to using the older one :(</li>
<li> Another thing that needs to be improved desperately is the cord doesn&#x27;t stay straight, tangles up .  </li>
<li> hair brushes are hard to find and this one is a waste of money.</li>
<li> My wife had been looking for a small curling brush.  </li>
<li> Her previous Vidal Sassoon curling brush lasted 32 years, and she was a little skeptical about this one based on the price.</li>
<li> The quality is not good.  </li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> The curling iron has all of the the teeth broken off and they slip off end of curling iron.</li>
<li> I am so sorry to be negative about the product</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
<li> Gets getting too expensive</li>
<li> Poor product!</li>
<li> For being a Vidal Sassoon product it is definitely a disappointment.</li>
<li> I was disappointed when I got it.</li>
<li> It is a piece of crap.</li>
<li> and I am very disappointed.  </li>
<li> I am so very disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> worst curling iron I have ever bought.</li>
<li> This is the worst curling iron I have ever used.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed!!</li>

    <li> The knob at the top turns easily and the bristles fall out.  The bristles also break easily.</li>
    <li> I love this curling brush, I wanted the smaller size, but tried this one and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast and gives good style and body.&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I love it is that I don&#x27;t burn myself like a regular curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short and it still makes a good style.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had the smaller size too.</li>
    <li> This is the worst curling iron I have ever used.  The prongs are too short, and they keep falling out of the iron.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00158OO3A Vidal Sassoon 3/4\\&quot; Curling Brush]]  I was very happy to receive this item as my old one was about six years old and had started to lose some of the \\&quot;brush teeth\\&quot;.  However almost immediately it started to come apart. The rows of \\&quot;brush teeth\\&quot; slid off the end and wouldn&#x27;t stay on. I expected better from Vidal Sassoon.   I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, let alone buy another one. Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for.  Not too big and not too small in diameter for my medium length hair.  It adds a nice smooth finishing touch to my hairdo.</li>
    <li> I could not find the curling brush in dept. stores, so when I found them on line, whoopee!!!  Thanks for stocking them,</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use a curling iron so this is a great substitution !!&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> Great brush iron, I had to retire the one I had which was just like the this one. It lasted me for about 10 years hopefully this one will to!</li>
    <li> [...] Just what my Wife was looking for she had a old vs 123 we thought we could not find a like item you came through Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase. The iron takes too long to heat up and the heat isn&#x27;t what I have had from other Sassoon curling irons. It is in my closet and I have gone back to using the older one :(</li>
    <li> The curling iron has all of the the teeth broken off and they slip off end of curling iron. worst curling iron I have ever bought. Diane Blomberg</li>
    <li> I have had several brush curling irons... this one does not get hot enough, and the brushes slide out.  Poor product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush to replace my old VSW curling brush. It is a piece of crap. Most of the bristles have already broken off. I had my previous brush for about 4 yrs before the teeth started to break off. For being a Vidal Sassoon product it is definitely a disappointment.</li>
    <li> The pictured item is not what was sent and I am very disappointed.  Why can&#x27;t you just send what is shown, which is what I wanted.  The item sent was a regular 3/4 inch curling iron with an attachment.  I specificly wanted the item as shown.  To me, this is sort of bait and switch.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this model, Thanks.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon 3/4&amp;#34; curling Brush. I like this iron, how ever this one doesn&#x27;t turn on easily. I have thought I turned it only to come back and find it wasn&#x27;t on.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes keeps coming out of socket &amp; doesn&#x27;t heat properly.  I will look more carefully before ordering another curling brush,.</li>
    <li> Brushes do not have comfort tips on the ends.  Using this product hurts my scalp.  It is the perfect size roller for length of my hair.</li>
    <li> The curling btush I received is not like the one in the advertised picture. It has an attachment that slides over the barrell rather than all together. I already had been using one like the one pictured and knew it would be acceptable. I will not be using this product. Maybe my grandchildren will use it. I was disappointed when I got it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace my old Vidal Sassoon curling brush, which I&#x27;d had for close to 20 years.  However the teeth in this brush must be made of a different plastic, because they are constantly breaking.  I bought two and have used up the teeth in both brushes.  Now I have wide gaps and have been burning my hand.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I like the way this curling iron does my hair and the way I can hold it in my hand but every few months I have to order another one since the little black plastic things break off little by little.  Another thing that needs to be improved desperately is the cord doesn&#x27;t stay straight, tangles up .  I shouldn&#x27;t have to be putting all this money out as often as I do for this product.  Please improve it!!!!!!!!!! Gets getting too expensive and I shall have to buy another curling iron similar to it if I&lt;br /&gt; can find one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because the cord wore out on my old one, and I couldn&#x27;t find a new one of the same model in the store.  I was dissapointed that the new one has hard plastic combs; whereas the old one had a more rubbery one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling brush for my mother who is 80+ years old and very outspoken when it comes to gadgets like this. She grilled me for 2 days when the TSA broke her curling brush during her flight inspection, prior to boarding the aircraft when she came to see me. Her previous Vidal Sassoon curling brush lasted 32 years, and she was a little skeptical about this one based on the price. But within 3 days of no complaints, I knew I had purchased the right one.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair so this particular curling iron is just the ticket!  In addition, it is easy to pack for travel.</li>
    <li> Had the same iron before. It finally burned out after..I&#x27;d  say...10 years. So I boight another one. So far. So good.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. I bought one many many years ago and it&#x27;s still working.  I wanted to find another one to use for travel and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  It&#x27;s so easy to use.  Heats up fast.  I like the fact that it does NOT have the clamp feature, most do.</li>
    <li> For unruly short hair, it is perfect, just heat, curl &amp; go. &amp; the tip that is not hot, Oh how many times have I burt my fingers on curling irons, this one does not. Just love it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought - it&#x27;s o.k. in a pinch - I wanted the hot air brush and thought this would suffice.</li>
    <li> Because of the stand it tangles in my hair. Also the tip or cap on the end is loose and I can&#x27;t tighten it. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just received the VS curling brush. I gave it a test try and I liked it because it has a warm temperature, preventing you from burning your hair and your hands. It satisfied my needs. I wanted something that would give me a bend, for added volume and bounce. It is also great for short hair.</li>
    <li> This is a backup brush for the smaller 1/2&amp;#34; size that I use regularly.  Sometimes this brush is the one&lt;br /&gt;needed when my hair has grown out a bit or I don&#x27;t want as tight a curl.</li>
    <li> I am so very disappointed with this product.  The quality is not good.  It is rough on the ends of the brush, does not feel good to the scalp, but heats ok.  I would not purchase one of them again.  To me it is not worth half of what it cost.  I am so sorry to be negative about the product but I have used several over the years of a different brand and never had this feeling toward one before.</li>
    <li> Had this iron for years and years and bought it again.  I works perfectly for my shorter hair.  good good</li>
    <li> It works like a charm -- excellent!  It is very convenient and easy to use!  I highly recommend it!  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> It was a good choice.  My wife had been looking for a small curling brush.  This is what she was needing.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for in a retro style curling brush.  For those moments when I don&#x27;t want to use a straightner and want that extra curl and bounce.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to replace an old 3/4\\&quot; hair brush which I had for many years before it stopped working, the Vidal Sassoon 3/4\\&quot; seemed to be a good replacement - I used it 3 times briefly on bangs and the plastic teeth strip came out. It is a huge disappointment, the stores are stocked with hot irons&lt;br /&gt;but hair brushes are hard to find and this one is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used another brand for years. This one did not have an automatic shut off feature that I am used to</li>
    <li> Have same brush but it is about 15/20 years old. not doing job very&lt;br /&gt;well. have looked at all local stores (ie) kohl&#x27;s, walmart, target,any where&lt;br /&gt;hair products were offered. nothing came close,as my hair is very soft, like baby hair. couldn&#x27;t believe when i saw ad on amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;very happy with product</li>
    <li> The curling brush does a good job of the actual curling, but I do find that my hair often gets caught in the teeth .  That may be becuase they do slide out, as other reviewers have said.  Nonetheless I like it - I just have to be aware of its idiosyncracies.</li>
    <li> This product works okay.  I thought it would have an automatic turn off though.  It&#x27;s not quite as effective as I thought it may be.</li>
