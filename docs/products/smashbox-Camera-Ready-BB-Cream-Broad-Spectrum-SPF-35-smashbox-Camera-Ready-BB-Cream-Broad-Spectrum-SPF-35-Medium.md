      <li>You will still need  concealer to cover up any blemishes you wish to hide but this feels perfect on your face</li>
      <li>Excellent coverage with a matte finish.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for my oily skin.</li>
      <li>This is the best BB cream on the market!</li>

      <li>When I did use it, I LOVED the way it made my skin look and feel.  </li>
      <li>Good under mineral powder foundation.  </li>
      <li>I have oily skin but had read a lot of reviews that this product was good for my skin type.</li>
      <li>but coverage wise</li>
      <li>If I want light cover, I wear it alone or for a flawless finish I wear MAC Studio finish powder over it.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good for the day</li>
      <li>Though its good brand and really nice BB cream.</li>
      <li>Camera ready is the perfect name for this.  </li>
      <li>and it has a nice finish.</li>
      <li>So its good if you are on the go and want something light.</li>
      <li>truly makes you picture ready and helps you feel good about your complexion!</li>
      <li>This BB cream is very light and has never clogged up my pores.</li>
      <li>and I get soooooo many compliments on my face</li>
      <li>and I think goes on and stays on better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing more than a tinted moisturizer ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love it</li>
      <li>(Straight men don&#x27;t like it when a woman asks if ur wearing cover up FYI lol).</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
      <li>The others are more like a tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>i love this pruduct a lot</li>
      <li>Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream looks great on and I received it promptly which I appreciate.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I just say I&#x27;m using a new face moisturizer lol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great if you just want something light and natural on your face.</li>
      <li>so this works fine.</li>
      <li>Excellent makeup for concealing all of life&#x27;s little blemishes .....</li>
      <li>Enjoy FYI  </li>
      <li>but again, a &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; that was too light for me.  </li>
      <li>but I think this is a fabulous product.</li>
      <li>I use this as my foundation and it keeps me shine free all day.</li>
      <li>The coverage is perfect and does not feel heavy.</li>
      <li>Then, I lightly add MAC foundation.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price!</li>
      <li>looks very natural and it give your face a nice glow.</li>
      <li>If you prefer a dewier finish go for the Clinique CC cream, I like it as much - and even better than the Smashbox CC cream.</li>
      <li>Pretty lightweight, decent coverage, nice that it has sunscreen spf 35.  </li>
      <li>For a dark brown skin person, it looks great and photos well</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>but then I received a sample of the medium and realize that the medium fit me much better and the medium deep  made me look like I have a tan.</li>
      <li>the only thing I have to touch up is my lipstick so to each their own</li>
      <li>definitely more matte and more coverage than some other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and easily break out, so I don&#x27;t like to wear too much makeup.</li>
      <li>No way should this cost as much as it does!</li>
      <li>I bought this at Sephora because I wanted to try it first.</li>
      <li>So I went to Sefora and this lady raved about how many of her male friends use it as a part of their AM ritual now, and that it looks like u have no makeup on.</li>
      <li>and it really keeps my face looking fresh all day.</li>
      <li>I think I could wear it alone, but I use it sparingly on my entire face and then add more to the areas with my acne spots.</li>
      <li>I am Black woman, browned skinned with some acne scarring due to hormonal imbalance and it provides good coverage and provides EVEN BETTER under foundation.</li>
      <li>and it is just what is says Camera Ready.  </li>
      <li>They had a whole display of BB creams.</li>
      <li>There was nothing camera ready about it.</li>
      <li>It was very cakie for a BB.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t cover very well</li>
      <li>it blend really well</li>
      <li>For more coverage you can apply more - a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Its very light and the cream isn&#x27;t that dark for a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34;creme.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
      <li>While this product provided quick and easy coverage, I had to constantly pat down my face to remove the excess oil and shine - thus not being &amp;#34;camera ready&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>each individual skin type is unique and inherently different.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t cover your blemishes or dark spots so if you need a full coverage,this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>There is nothing better than this, quite expensive, but worth every single penny!</li>
      <li>To all the dark skin women who wishes to puchase,go to the store and try on first before purchasing it doesn&#x27;t match all of us.</li>
      <li>The worst part is I have fairly blemish free skin as it is...</li>
      <li>a little goes a long way, will be too matte finish if you use too much, blends easily, highly recommend.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great coverage- definitely more matte and more coverage than some other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried. I use this as my foundation and it keeps me shine free all day. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am a  Caramell color  And this color is perfect. You will still need  concealer to cover up any blemishes you wish to hide but this feels perfect on your face I&#x27;ve had it on for over eight hours and I didn&#x27;t have to redo it.  I don&#x27;t wear heavy make up where you can tell  that I have 3 pounds of makeup on so some people may want to redo it before the day is over but for me one application in the morning and I&#x27;m good for the day the only thing I have to touch up is my lipstick so to each their own but I think this is a fabulous product. Enjoy FYI  I will totally purchase this again, I actually purchased the medium deep from Sephora but then I received a sample of the medium and realize that the medium fit me much better and the medium deep  made me look like I have a tan. A slight tan but a tan none the less. In the summer the deep may work because I always get a tan in the summer.</li>
    <li> Wrong purchase, color bit dark for my skin. Will do a youtube giveaway and probably giveaway this. Though its good brand and really nice BB cream. Bit hygiene obsessed can&#x27;t use the open or used product</li>
    <li> this is amazing, you have no idea how good this BB cream is! looks very natural and it give your face a nice glow. I will never use any other BB cream.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  I use this as a primer and then put on my foundation after.  You can also use this alone.  It takes away any imperfections you have and it is just what is says Camera Ready.  I do not want to be without this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best BB cream on the market! I will not use anything else! The coverage is perfect and does not feel heavy. I like to wear it alone on the weekend for sheer coverage without caking on a bunch of makeup. The SPF 35 is an added bonus I don&#x27;t have to use a seperate sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Excellent makeup for concealing all of life&#x27;s little blemishes ..... truly makes you picture ready and helps you feel good about your complexion!</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way, will be too matte finish if you use too much, blends easily, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin but had read a lot of reviews that this product was good for my skin type. Spoiler alert: each individual skin type is unique and inherently different. On that note this made my skin even oilier. While this product provided quick and easy coverage, I had to constantly pat down my face to remove the excess oil and shine - thus not being &amp;#34;camera ready&amp;#34;. Maybe if you apply this immediately before being photographed? Otherwise be prepared to constantly use oil blotting sheets while wearing this BB cream.</li>
    <li> I wear this BB cream daily with &amp; without additional foundation.  If I want light cover, I wear it alone or for a flawless finish I wear MAC Studio finish powder over it.  Unlike any other BB Cream.</li>
    <li> but again, a &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; that was too light for me.  From now on I get shades that go Medium to Deep.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. The foundation made my skin look blotchy and had poor coverage. There was nothing camera ready about it.</li>
    <li> Pretty lightweight, decent coverage, nice that it has sunscreen spf 35.  Good under mineral powder foundation.  Not great at hiding major dark spots or blemishes</li>
    <li> For a dark brown skin person, it looks great and photos well but it doesn&#x27;t cover your blemishes or dark spots so if you need a full coverage,this isn&#x27;t it. I just started using proativ to clear my face and can&#x27;t wear heavy makeup so this works fine.Its very light and the cream isn&#x27;t that dark for a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34;creme.So its good if you are on the go and want something light. I wear Laura Mercier radiance primer under. It looks great on me. To all the dark skin women who wishes to puchase,go to the store and try on first before purchasing it doesn&#x27;t match all of us.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t cover very well however i like the idea that it has SP 35 and oil control in it. it blend really well and it has a nice finish. i could buy this again as my primer and sun protection if the price goes between $20-25.</li>
    <li> I too was thinking \\&quot;this must be some great stuff!\\&quot;---- not even close. It&#x27;s nothing more than a tinted moisturizer ...well, if even that. No coverage, no significant moisturizing, no great camera finish etc. The worst part is I have fairly blemish free skin as it is... I cant imagine someone with blemishes trying to use it!!!  No way should this cost as much as it does!</li>
    <li> i love this pruduct a lot and i would give it a 5 stars, if it doesnt have the wrong color name. it is not medium, it is medium/dark rather. I have olive skin, and this color would be great on me in the summer. but i bought in the winter and therefore it came out way too dark. but coverage wise it&#x27;s great, and it&#x27;s matte. so it&#x27;s perfect for my oily skin. so i will purchase a light/medium for now, and keep the medium for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
    <li> For the price I was not very impressed by this BB Cream.  I have been using the Garnier and I think goes on and stays on better.</li>
    <li> Hated it the color was medium and was so dark I gave it away to someone with very dark skin,  and it is quite pricey. The medium is not a true medium and it had a yellow tone and it was very heavy do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I went ahead and bought this BB cream cuz the Garnier one sux!! It was very cakie for a BB. So I went to Sefora and this lady raved about how many of her male friends use it as a part of their AM ritual now, and that it looks like u have no makeup on. (Straight men don&#x27;t like it when a woman asks if ur wearing cover up FYI lol). Im still on the same tube I bought in April and I get soooooo many compliments on my face it&#x27;s insane! I just say I&#x27;m using a new face moisturizer lol. 5 stars ALL THE WAY!!!!</li>
    <li> There is nothing better than this, quite expensive, but worth every single penny! Definitely a must have for any makeup lover!</li>
    <li> I have been using the trail size of this for a couple months but no on a regular basis. When I did use it, I LOVED the way it made my skin look and feel.  Camera ready is the perfect name for this.  It can be used alone or under foundation.  Provides all the things your skins need, SPF, Moisturizer, Primer, Oil Control and evens tone.  Can&#x27;t ask for more.  It is well worth the price! I am Black woman, browned skinned with some acne scarring due to hormonal imbalance and it provides good coverage and provides EVEN BETTER under foundation. I am MEDIUM.  LOVE IT THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage with a matte finish.  If you prefer a dewier finish go for the Clinique CC cream, I like it as much - and even better than the Smashbox CC cream.</li>
    <li> I cannot give this product enough stars. I have very sensitive skin and easily break out, so I don&#x27;t like to wear too much makeup. But I do like to have some coverage on my face as I have some scars from previous breakouts. This BB cream is very light and has never clogged up my pores. For more coverage you can apply more - a little goes a long way. It does a wonderful job of coverage, moisturizing, and keeping oil under control. I would say I have combination skin and it really keeps my face looking fresh all day. It&#x27;s great if you just want something light and natural on your face.</li>
    <li> Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream looks great on and I received it promptly which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> Item was returned because color was to dark,</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sephora because I wanted to try it first. They had a whole display of BB creams. The Sephora retailers are always helpful. The woman told me she thought smashbox was the best because of the coverage. The others are more like a tinted moisturizer. I have dark acne spots that eventually fade, but in the mean time, need to be concealed. This does the job! I think I could wear it alone, but I use it sparingly on my entire face and then add more to the areas with my acne spots. Then, I lightly add MAC foundation. You can&#x27;t see any of my spots and I don&#x27;t think I look \\&quot;too made-up.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Korean BB cream; the one in the wide pink bottle and was very disappointed. I don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t have different shades, because it does give you a grayish tint. So, I tried mixing it with my foundation.</li>
