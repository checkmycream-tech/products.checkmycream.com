<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I prefer this patchouly over other brands blends. Its pretty soft and prettier, more like a perfume than just an essential oil. Also if I wear this I don&#x27;t think I smell as much like a teenage goth from the 90&#x27;s as I do a sophisticated woman who likes earthy blends if that makes any sense...</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware, this product smells like somebody pissed in a bottle and added a hint of patchouli to cover it up, then it takes weeks to receive what I call a gag joke in the mail.</li>
    <li> I got these for my manager... she loved it!</li>
    <li> the best I have ever had!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t jazzed about this as much as when I read the reviews and what I thought it would smell like. I don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
    <li> One of the best patchouli oils on the market. However Majik is my favorite from Auric Blends.That aside this patchouli oil can be blended with other oils from the Auric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best patchouli oils on the market,however Majik is my favorite oil from Auric Blends.This oil can be blended with other Auric Blend oils. a brand I have grown to love.!You can find them on Amazon thankfully.</li>
    <li> Well, we know patchouli is not for everyone, and most people if born between 1965 and 1985 think of the grateful dead or a bong when they smell this, i must say: I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS!&lt;br /&gt;The earthy, mossy, density, and just plain dirtiness of this wonder oil is something I love and use and will always use everyday. I even mix this with other fragrances. If you are into woody fragrances, like: Terre D&#x27;Hermes, Molecule 01, M7, Dirty English, etc....place some of this on your wrist and chest, then add your favorite woods cologne. My wife loves this stuff too, even my 7 year old daughter sniffs daddy&#x27;s wrist as we read at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must give massive props to Auric Blends! Of all the patchouli oils i have tried, and i have tried tons, this is THE ONE, THE # 1!!! It is so perfectly balanced and once the pure earthy dirt dries down, the warm,  almost herbaceous sweetness rolls around your skin yet doesnt scream, POTHEAD! Excellence is measured over time, and Auric Blends has not only graduated the school of excellence,  they own the university! Cheers!</li>
    <li> The perfume oil I received was a diluted version of what I&#x27;d come to expect from Auric Blends. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Always wore a light perfume, however, some of my senior friends began to indicate it bothered them and ask that I not wear it while in their presence. My step-daughter wears the patchouli product and it has such a nice subtle aroma that I decided to try it. Surprise, now my senior friends are asking me &amp;#34;what is that perfume you are wearing, I love it&amp;#34;!!  Success accomplished and I am 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Patchouli Body Oils I have ever tried and I love the roller ball for easy application!</li>
    <li> Classic scent! love it. Came super quick!</li>
    <li> The scent is still the same scent that I love, but the viscosity of the oil has been thinned out since the last time I purchased this same product- I wish it was still thicker like it used to be.</li>
    <li> I love it , IS smell soo good but not too strong</li>
    <li> This is the best patchouli scent I have ever used. A small amount applied lasts all day. I have had numerous comments on it.</li>
    <li> Patchouli oil is a wonderful smell. You have to get the RIGHT Patchouli oil however, and I found this one the ONLY way to find this oil, by smelling it on someone else. I collared up the male nurse and asked him EXACTLY which oil he used. Only two stores in my city that I know of carry it and both were out, so I was DELIGHTED to find it here on Amazon. This oil is a GREAT punk repellant also because the only two people I recall that didn&#x27;t like this scent needed an elbow to the nose anyway.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, a little bit goes a loooooonnnggg way</li>
    <li> Patchouly is hard to find sometime, This Auric blends roll on is perfect, easy to apply &amp; a nice aroma plus a great price. The shipment arrived quickly there were no after purchase issues.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. Always use patchouli, but discovered amber patchouli is also wonderful. The best scents I&#x27;ve found that allow me self expression without affecting my allergies. Great prices too!!!</li>
    <li> Authentic patchouli scent. Not watered down like some brands. Auric blends is the real deal.</li>
    <li> As good as it gets in old school aromatherapy.  Spiritual yet very much of the earth.  This particular blend has lasting power and a little goes a long way.  Well worth the meager cost.</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend of mine as a request by them for their birthday to get them some patchouli oil as we are old timers and loved patchouli back in the day.  He said it was very very strong.  I told him it was oil.  Tread lightly.  He liked it though.  Also got him the soap and he liked that more</li>
    <li> This patchouli oil disappointed me. It wasn&#x27;t as expensive as some but it could have had a stronger scent. The smell itself was quite pleasing but just didn&#x27;t last as long as it should have.</li>
    <li> I love Patchouly and this version does it justice. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 out of 5 because the roller seems to be of poor quality and it doesn&#x27;t roll on as it should, but the scent itself is great.</li>
    <li> Awesome earthy scent! Lasts for a while. It smells just as Patchouli should. Another Auric Blends satisfied buyer. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of patchouli. i wear it all the time. i bought this one for my sis. will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really disgusting. I was looking for another pachouli scent, one that kinda has a sharp crisp, almost peppery smell.   This one is awful! I can only describe it as mildew, woodchips, with a hint of Vics vapor rub. UGHH!!! NASTY!   But... I guess I should also mention that I am allergic to woodchips so that may be affecting what I think of it. I guess others may like it, but I sure don&#x27;t. Not even worth it to get my money back.</li>
    <li> I just got the patchouly oil perfume and was expecting something musky with a bit of sweetness. well this isn&#x27;t the stuff. It&#x27;s VERY strong and VERY woodsy/earthy. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like those kinda smells but this just smelled like strong dirt to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay. this scent really grew on me! it just threw me off at first because it is so strong and i was expecting something else. all i can say is that you should give this scent a chance. like i said earlier, it is VERY STRONG. so i just use a tiny bit mixed with another scent (maybe something more lighter or sweet) and it&#x27;s perfect! I dont know what happened, but this scent is so comforting and familar to me now. very bohemian-ish!</li>
    <li> Order arrived on time, which is important. I bought this product when I visited Berkeley, CA and had been searching for it. It is exactly like the original. Light, refreshing and mildly fragrant.</li>
    <li> wonderful scent and fast shipping time</li>
    <li> Fast ship, perfect product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> What the heck is this? I remember Auric Blends patchouli smelling well... like patchouli. This is weirdly runny and too sharp smelling. There is a nice earthy undertone, but not much. Very disappointed. If anyone knows a good patchouli that smells properly, let me know.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Long lasting fragrance that is soothing, original, and sensual. I give it two thumbs way way up!</li>
    <li> Really good Patch.I have many other brands,thought I would give this one a try.It is not to overwhelming like some,it&#x27;s just right.I am a long time user of patch.For me, a good product.</li>
    <li> If you like the real Patchouli from the past- this is the oil you will want to try. Best smelling but strong Patchouli I&#x27;ve smelled since the 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This oil is so close to the actual smell of Patchouli.  A little goes a long way unless you want people to question why you&#x27;re wearing it - if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> The oil has a very storng and almost bitter smell but when applied to the skin it smells great. My husband loves it and says I smell like a true hippie now.. I&#x27;ve even caught him using it!</li>
    <li> reliable auric bends oil</li>
    <li> Nice smelling. A very unique smell. I love this oil because it has an unmistakeable scent that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s own so I&#x27;m very pleased!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this!  A most &#x27;soft&#x27; fragrance, not bitter or harsh (as some can be) at all.  I only wish the beautiful fragrance lasted a bit longer, but I think this is just the patchouli oil itself, it just doesn&#x27;t stay a strong fragrance for long.  I will however buy this again.</li>
    <li> I only wear Patchouli. And Auric blends is the most consistent blend of Patchouli I have ever used. I buy several at a time, so I am guaranteed NOT to run out! Thanks, Auric!</li>
    <li> This Patouli Oil has a rich true fragrance and is by far the best oil made anywhere, it lasts all day...I&#x27;ve tried many and this one tops then all for quality.</li>
    <li> Totally love this item</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly.  So far this is the best smelling patchouli out there.  I am always trying new ones but, always come back to this brand.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! An earthy deep strong smelling Patchouli! :) If you love the REAL smell of Patchouli, this product is for you! I&#x27;m a customer for life!!</li>
    <li> I love patchouly. Always have.But when I got this stuff along with \\&quot;Egyptian Goddess\\&quot; which is nice. Yuck!!!!! It really does smell like insecticide. There are lots of nice patchouly fragrances out there . One that is really good is spray \\&quot;musk\\&quot; called \\&quot;Patchouli Musk\\&quot; by Coty. I know you can get it, but it has far exceeded the price I paid back in the day of $4.99. I think it is something like $40.00 . It is warm, earthy and very sexy. But it is out there. This oil doesn&#x27;t even compare.&lt;br /&gt;  I suppose, like most fragrances, it smells different on everyone who wears it, so I want to give it its props. Just not on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren Allen</li>
    <li> Love this, has a great smell, last all day and was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Has formula been changed?  It used to be somewhat sweet &amp; spicy - now only spicy.  Been using it for years - not the same  - also much paler in color.  Bring back my old patchouli!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this item 3 times! It&#x27;s the right amount of scent for true patchouli lovers, a little dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My Very Favorite Brand!! I have bought high dollar brands.They don&#x27;t compare!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT SMELL WILL BUY AGAIN NEXT YEAR</li>
    <li> I LOVE patchouli. The product I received was great. BUT they sent it with cod for postage!! Really??? I will NEVER buy from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> Little sweeter than my regular Patchouli, but still very nice. I have used only Patchouli for most of my life so like to try any I find.</li>
    <li> i have worn patchouly for years. Iike this because of the roll on. smells awesome and last for a long time.</li>
    <li> It was very thick and grainy and the scent smelled as though it was sitting around for some time.  Maybe I will try another one</li>
    <li> Always perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived early, great job! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This stuff smelled awful.  It didn&#x27;t smell like patchouli at all and had a very artificial smell that immediately gave me a headache, and I am not really sensitive to that type of stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this patchouli oil! It&#x27;s very earthy and lasts a long time! You don&#x27;t need much to smell it for hours. I&#x27;m very happy with my order!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Good price.</li>
    <li> This oil is not for me, I mixed it with other blends and that changed the smell all together to a more pleasing sent for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been satisfied with this product over the past 5 years...generally ordering several bottles at a time to keep an inventory. However I noticed with my July, 2012 purchase that the oil was clearer in color and seemed less viscous, like it had been \\&quot;watered down\\&quot;. The oil does not have the fragrance potency of previous shipments. Regrettably it seems Auric Blends has succumbed to what manufacturers are doing to make a buck nowadays....making the product \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; and charging a higher price for it. Curious as to what  Auric Blends had to say, I contacted them directly upon receiving my shipment...they have not responded to date. Like they care, right?</li>
    <li> This truly smelled like patchouli!</li>
    <li> I ordered this one for a friend.  She loves Patchouly.  It gives me a headache.  Can&#x27;t wait until her birthday so I can give it to her.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.  Great Quality Patchouli oil for a great price</li>
    <li> Best patchouli oil I&#x27;ve used.  I have been a patchouli user all my teenage and adult life.  Usually I need to use more to get the aroma I want.  This happens to be a wonderful full bodied pure patchouli oil, with just a drop or two being sufficient for that euphoric smell that I&#x27;m so attached to.  From now on this is my source for patchouli! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am not crazy about this and was so excited about it too. I love Patchouli smelling things of all kinds ( oils, wax melts, soaps, so on), but this body oil smelled very off. I thought it could just not be mixing well with my scent but after putting it on many people ( boyfriend, friends, even on my mom ) I decided it just didn&#x27;t smell right and no one else liked it either. The Egyptian Goddess one smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> smelled a patchoulely hand cream, obviously had other additives, smell patchouly before you purchase - smelled like dirt and made me want to gag - I can&#x27;t beleive people wear this - I am allergic to many scents but nothing is better to this</li>
    <li> heavy earthy patchouli. that&#x27;s why I bought it</li>
    <li> The color of this oil is a medium colored gold.  The oil smells heavily of menthol almost like it&#x27;s been diluted with a Vic&#x27;s vapor rub scent. Immediately after application it has a very medicinal, clinical cedar like smell with a hint of patchouli wafting somewhere in the background if you have the patience to sniff it out.  But in the dry down (in about an hour, more or less) the faint scent of patchouli becomes more prominent and slowly more dominant, but it remains very faint and relatively unnoticeable even with heavy 3+ rolls of application on my wrists.  Overall, I probably would not buy this scent again as I personally detest menthol like smells and am too impatient to wait for the possibility of smelling the scent I intended to receive.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It can be worn alone or with another cologne and lasts all day.  The roll on feature is helpful and doesn&#x27;t leave your fingers smelling like patchouly.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, strong and lasts a long time.  I have ordered this item three times, as I love wearing Patchouly oils.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this about 10 years ago, and I remember a small dab from the roller being enough. Anymore than that, and people would complain about how potent it was.  I find that I need about 3 rolls from the roller to get the same smell that I remember. Maybe my nose has changed, or maybe the strength has been diluted.  Either way, this is some lovely Patchouli, very earthy, very woody.  I love wearing it in place of expensive perfumes that typically fade and are full of chemicals anyway.</li>
    <li> Always fast and efficient !!!</li>
    <li> Shipping was extremely fast, price was right.  When I got it, I opened it, smelled it.........and did not like it.  It was very strong, and very very masculine.  So I did what any loving wife would do, I gave it to my husband.  I asked him to not to put too much on when he wore it.  Well, he wore it, and I went crazy.  The oil goes on strong but the dry down is amazing.  It smells wonderful, (the longer you have it on the better it smells), so good in fact that he wore it two days in a row, something he NEVER does.  This cologne is great!!!  I may not wear it on myself as its really masculine to me, but you can bet my husband will have it on at each and every opportunity.</li>
    <li> I have tried every Patchouli since the 60&#x27;s. This is the best. Warm and woody and has a softness that doesn&#x27;t over power you. Very very fast delivery. I bought two, and I will be back. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite body oils. The more you sweat the better it smells. It is not expensive and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love Patchouli. I have tried a billion different brands, and Auric Blends is the best smelling that I have have found. A little goes a long way, and is fantastic. (Also it seems to be more &amp;#34;tolerable&amp;#34; for my friends who really dislike patchouli, Probably due to the great mix of this oil. If you like Patchouli, you&#x27;ve got to check this out. I&#x27;ve worn this brand for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I get a ton of compliments.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, goes on well.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for as far back as i can remember, and it&#x27;s the only thing i will use. I use it almost every day and the bottle will last well over a year. Mainly due to it being so concentrated, a dab on either side of my ear and a dab one 1 wrist, that I&#x27;ll rub the other wrist with, is more than enough and it last&#x27;s all day. The only problem beginners will have is simply putting to much,once you do that I&#x27;m sorry to say your screwed. Cause you will be told by complete strangers. What is that smell.. Done correctly though women and even men will ask what it is. And on rare occassions you&#x27;ll bump into another Patchouli addict</li>
    <li> very happy with product</li>
    <li> I usually buy directly from the company, but this was a bit cheaper and came just as fast.  I love this smell on my husband.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 50 different patchouli oils, and none come close to AB&#x27;s.  This is everything patchouli should be:  rich, earthy, dark, woody, slightly menthol/floral... uplifting and soothing.  A bottle will last years.  The only patch I&#x27;ll use straight.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> This smells like insect spray. Tossed both in the trash.</li>
    <li> Like Vetiver, ok for blending but not for base fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed</li>
    <li> Great powerful scent.  Just a dab its all good!  RIGHT ON!</li>
    <li> This is the best Patchouly oil that I have found..and I have tried many.  This is very very strong and to be used sparingly.  It is not pleasing to smell directly from the applicator, but once it is on, it has a very wonderful and subtle scent of true patchouly.</li>
    <li> This does not smell very good ---I was expecting a real Patchouli smell---I am sorry i could not wear it---it must be for some other use than what I wanted it for---which was to wear!</li>
    <li> I like it. But it smells more of peppermint  than I wanted it to. Earthy yes but not quite 100% patchouli. Also It might have given me a rash.</li>
    <li> smells good rolls on well</li>
    <li> Love it! I love patchouli and this is it. Little goes a long way, and is lasting. I dabbed just a bit on one wrist, just a dab, and was able to rub that against the other wrist , neck, etc. I can tell this will go far. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Like another user, for some reason, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this at first.  I misplaced it and then found and tried it on again and was hooked!  It must have been my natural mystic vibe was off the first time, because it really is the good stuff.  People love it.  I love the faint sweet muskiness of it that remains in my clothes after I have worn it.  I think it also kind of soothes me and helps mellow me out a bit.  I can be pretty Type A.  If you like patchouli for a body oil, get it. This is good stuff.</li>
    <li> Nice product, a little strong but I mix it with unscented lotion.</li>
    <li> I used to drive 12 hours once a year to Durango, CO, just to buy &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; Patchouli there, don&#x27;t want to do this anymore and was looking to buy one  closer to me. Without sucess. I hesitated, of course, ordering online but after reading the reviews here about this oil, I thought, well, for that money there&#x27;s not much to loose and ordered it. Wow! I love love love it! Exactly what I was looking for, better than many others I&#x27;ve used since the 70s/80s The roll on is great to use and distribute. The oil is indeed pretty strong, but then again, it IS Patchouli, right?  You do not need much to create a great Patchouli spirit around you. However, I am so happy I went for this one and can only recommend it, to a Patchouli lover.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but, the scent wasnt what I think of  patchouli. Very light hint of patchouli but oily and something like fresh dirt. But that&#x27;s how it goes when you buy something without trying it or taking a chance based on reviews. I think you could wrap a cat turd in cellophane and label it &amp;#34;patchouli scented organic media&amp;#34; and someone would buy it! I&#x27;d say try a different oil but hey, you may get another dud?</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother in law because, she loves patchouli. she absolutely loves it and, I tried some and I liked it..it is very earthy and sweet but, also pungent. I also read a lot of reviews on patchouli oils and I guess according to real hippies it is pretty hard to find the real good smelling kind anymore. I think this brand smells good.</li>
