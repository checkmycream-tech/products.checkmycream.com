      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>and now my colour is bright and vibrant and beautiful!</li>

      <li>Good price, and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Nice feel to your hair, mine being fine.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for.</li>
      <li>Although I can tell my hair shimmers with more redness, the shampoo does not seem to cleanse my hair thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Have been using it for many years, but can no longer buy in stores.  </li>
      <li>Ordered it (great price) and got it fast.  </li>

      <li>It protected my color and kept my hair nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product which was advertised and purchased as 8.45 oz, 2 pack.  </li>
      <li>and it smells pretty good too :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m throwing the rest of this away getting some Bed Head and a good hot oil treatment to try to fix what this did to my hair.</li>
      <li>I always use Brilliant Brunette shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners, but awhile back I wanted a change</li>
      <li>Works great for bringing out highlights and also leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair looking good and doesn&#x27;t let it fade as fast.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and has a pretty red/clear color.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo for dyed red hair.</li>
      <li>I dyed my hair red and this shampoo works great at preserving the color.</li>
      <li>I wish this shampoo truly did work, as I have not found any shampoo that is great for dyed red hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was a great shampoo for keeping my hair red after I dyed it.</li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>People say the first 5 ingredients make any product, because they are most of the product.</li>
      <li>and my hair is STILL atleast 80% of the color it originally was.</li>
      <li>Even though it is costly, I guess Im willing to pay the couple bucks more for my natural red hair. :D</li>
      <li>I find that it keeps my hair from fading too quickly.</li>
      <li>This wonderful shampoo really helps to brighten up your red hair color and to make your hair soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>This product has sulfates in it which strips your hair of color, and it smells like hairspray, which my husband did not like, but it does make hair more manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>This is the most epic shampoo ever</li>
      <li>I changed for a more natural shampoo for a couple of days, I used the dr bronner castile soap [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I purchased this right away.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t prolong color any more than using regular shampoo does.</li>
      <li>Sure enough.  </li>
      <li>I love these two products and will definitely re-purchase!</li>
      <li>Keeps color very well!</li>
      <li>At the end of the first week when my hair looked exactly the way</li>
      <li>I researched the internet and found that the cause it is the sodium lauryl sulfate, which is one of the first 5 ingredients of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t need a lot of it, so it lasts a long time (and my hair is about to my knees now, so seriously, go easy on it!</li>
      <li>My reds seem more shiny/bright in light, and that makes me feel like less of a mucky-brown lol.&lt;br /&gt;you</li>
      <li>This stuff smells nice and looks okay, but as someone who has dyed my hair red for nearly 20 years, I think the coloresses sulfate free stuff you can buy at Sally or Loreal&#x27;s sulfate free line work just as well at maintaining color and cost the same or less.</li>
      <li>This product is chock full of sulfates, basically contradicting itself completely.</li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my red hair more vibrant.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is really strong, and it removes so much of my red with each shampoo.</li>
      <li>It worked amazing, and I am continuing to use the Vampire Red dye about every month to maintain my red hair.</li>
      <li>Did you know that sulfates in shampoos are what strips the color away so fast?</li>
      <li>The shampoo lathers up really well</li>
      <li>No wonder sulfate free shampoos are having so big popularity.</li>
      <li>Do your research and be responsible with your health and hair.</li>
      <li>It removed much of the dye and now I even have some splotchy spots.</li>
      <li>straight and slippery hair:(&lt;br</li>
      <li>This really brings out the color.  </li>
      <li>A few months ago I began using this product, and I have been thrilled with the results.</li>
      <li>It really makes the red pop even more, actually.</li>
      <li>I am going to try a different brand of red enhancing shapoo to see if it will work better with my hair.</li>
      <li>I was nervous that even with using this shampoo my red hair would wash out quickly....</li>
      <li>This is a decent shampoo, but I don&#x27;t see any color enhancement at all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that using it every three washes (about every week) helps keep my red a bit more vibrant than it normally is but doesn&#x27;t have me constantly have unmanageable hair.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Sodium lauryl sulfate a high volume synthetic chemical used in consumer products and regulated as a pesticide.</li>
      <li>If you really want your red to last, try something sulfate free.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily, only twice a week, but other shampoos washed the red out almost instantly, this one keeps it in much longer...and a good price!</li>
      <li>The ONLY thing I wish was different is the fact that this is not a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>I also highly encourage using the matching conditioner; it gets hair really soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>My hair is still that pretty shade of red</li>
      <li>a quarter-sized dollop will go far!)</li>
      <li>Wow, no comparison!</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I had my hair dyed with the John Frieda Radiant Red shade 3VR.</li>
      <li>I have no problems with my hair getting clean whenever I use other brands.  </li>
      <li>By the end of the first month my hair had lost maybe 5% of the color it originally had whereas normally I&#x27;d be down 75% back to my natural color.</li>
      <li>Since this shampoo faded that dye so quickly I purchased Manic Panic hair dye in Vampire Red to refreshen my red.</li>
      <li>I have natural auburn hair color, so I decided to purchase this item.  </li>
      <li>However, the chemical is frequently combined with TEA (triethanolamine), DEA (diethanolamine), or MEA (monnoethanolamine), which can cause the formation of the carcinogenic substances nitrosames.\\&quot;     </li>
      <li>Everyone told me how fast red hair color fades so after I got it dyed</li>
      <li>And absolutely use together with Radiant Red conditioner!</li>
      <li>It helps prolong my color and leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I recently gave this shampoo another try on my freshly dyed hair, big mistake.</li>
      <li>Okay, so we all know red hair is really hard to keep vibrant.</li>
      <li>So much so that I had to flat iron my hair</li>
      <li>I seriously can&#x27;t stop gushing over how much i love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I often dye my hair different shades or reds, from dark to light.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have natural auburn hair color, so I decided to purchase this item.  Although I can tell my hair shimmers with more redness, the shampoo does not seem to cleanse my hair thoroughly.  It leaves my hair feeling a little greasy.  I have no problems with my hair getting clean whenever I use other brands.  I am going to try a different brand of red enhancing shapoo to see if it will work better with my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my red hair more vibrant.  I am using it on my natural hair color, and at 50 yrs old, my hair color was getting a little dull.  This really brings out the color.  I am very happy with the product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used JF products and sadly this left my hair greasy and limp but bought the darker shade and loved it.Maybe this was a different mix.I have tried rinsing more and also using less product but no success. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Love this product which was advertised and purchased as 8.45 oz, 2 pack.  Would expect to receive second 8.45 oz of my order.  Otherwise will return as incomplete order.</li>
    <li> This product has sulfates in it which strips your hair of color, and it smells like hairspray, which my husband did not like, but it does make hair more manageable and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used it in the past and have been unable to find it in any stores around the area.  The shampoo lathers up really well and it does wonders for and red hair or red dyed hair.  Definitely recommend.  Plus the price is great.  What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> I started using this over a year ago on a whim. My hair is naturally a darkest brown with a slight hint at red highlight in the sun. I seriously can&#x27;t stop gushing over how much i love this stuff. My reds seem more shiny/bright in light, and that makes me feel like less of a mucky-brown lol.&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t need a lot of it, so it lasts a long time (and my hair is about to my knees now, so seriously, go easy on it! a quarter-sized dollop will go far!) the conditioner is also awesome at detangling, which has been a win for me and the hairbrush. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with other JF products, since i can&#x27;t seem to find either the shampoo or conditioner anywhere nearby, but i&#x27;m finding they all fall short of my expectations from having used Radiant Red.</li>
    <li> This is a decent shampoo, but I don&#x27;t see any color enhancement at all.  I use it because it is a good shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t enhance the color at all.  If you&#x27;re looking for a way to highlight fading red hair, go to the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> See title&#x27;, I went all over the place and couldn&#x27;t find this specific product.  then the light bulb went off, duh...check out Amazon.com.  Sure enough.  Ordered it (great price) and got it fast.  All that gas wasted.</li>
    <li> I bought the entire line of red enhancing John Freida products including shampoo, conditioner and glaze. After using these products for 2 weeks, my highlights still weren&#x27;t evenly tinted plus my hair was probably in the worst condition it has ever been in! I switched back to Kerastase products and included Ted Gibson conditioner in captivating copper, which I use by adding a small amount to my Kerastase condtioner. Wow, no comparison! My hair is looking great again and the TG keeps the highlights beautifully tinted even though I only add it to my conditioner twice per week! I had initially skipped over the TG and went for the JF because of reviews and price but in the end I wasted my money on the JF products which are some of the worst I have ever used! The TG colored conditioner is by far less costly since it works so well and I use a very small amount only twice per week. The bottle will probably last me at least 6 months to a year.</li>
    <li> This is the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made. It&#x27;s a little pricey for shampoo, but I only wash my hair once a week, and this really lasts long for me. I dye my hair a medium auburn red, and it would always go brassy and ugly within the first few weeks, and my hair is usually really good at keeping colour. This is the most epic shampoo ever and now my colour is bright and vibrant and beautiful! If you are having second thoughts, give it a try. And also the conditioner is great, and are made to be used together.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably one of those products where it is different for all hair types. I went from being a blonde to being a redhead. Everyone told me how fast red hair color fades so after I got it dyed I purchased this right away. My hair holds dye pretty well especially for having barely any pigment in it from being so blonde. I was nervous that even with using this shampoo my red hair would wash out quickly....but so far so good. My hair is still that pretty shade of red it was when I got it dyed. The ONLY thing I wish was different is the fact that this is not a sulfate free shampoo. It tends to dry my hair out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it smells pretty good too :)</li>
    <li> Okay, so we all know red hair is really hard to keep vibrant. Did you know that sulfates in shampoos are what strips the color away so fast? This product is chock full of sulfates, basically contradicting itself completely. If you really want your red to last, try something sulfate free. Also, other than NOT preserving my red, this stuff gave me mad scalp build-up. Would not buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for many years, but can no longer buy in stores.  I refuse to change to another product.</li>
    <li> After months of actually looking and trying to find the product in stores, I encountered it (on sale!) at a local CVS. I purchased it to brighten the coloring of my natural red hair, hoping that it would give the same effects on natural hair as well as dyed. Well, it does! This lathers perfectly and gets hair really clean, and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot to do it. Because it is a coloring build up product, I use a clarifying shampoo once a week to eliminate buildup, but the products work well together. I also highly encourage using the matching conditioner; it gets hair really soft and manageable. I love these two products and will definitely re-purchase!</li>
    <li> As with the conditioner, this product does contribute to keeping the red hair vibrant but it also was harsh on the scalp and caused dandruff.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for a week and was scare for the big amount of hair loss I was experiencing during and after washing my hair, combined with the conditioner from the same brand. I changed for a more natural shampoo for a couple of days, I used the dr bronner castile soap [[ASIN:B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 32 Ounce Bottle]] and was a big difference for me, cleaner hair whit almost not hair loss at all, just a few which it is normal, at least for me.    I researched the internet and found that the cause it is the sodium lauryl sulfate, which is one of the first 5 ingredients of this shampoo. People say the first 5 ingredients make any product, because they are most of the product. Look in the ingredients list of this product. I found this in internet:    \\&quot;Sodium lauryl sulfate a high volume synthetic chemical used in consumer products and regulated as a pesticide. A suspected gastrointestinal or liver toxicant, sodium lauryl sulfate can be drying and harsh for the hair and cause eye irritation, allergic reactions, and hair loss. According to the National Toxicology Program, it has shown moderate reproductive effects in experiments. It has not been tested for neurotoxicity.      Sodium lauryl sulfate is not a recognized carcinogen. However, the chemical is frequently combined with TEA (triethanolamine), DEA (diethanolamine), or MEA (monnoethanolamine), which can cause the formation of the carcinogenic substances nitrosames.\\&quot;     [...]    No wonder sulfate free shampoos are having so big popularity. Do your research and be responsible with your health and hair. Now a days we have to do our own homework. So far the one that worked wonderful for me was the castile from dr bronner. I never felt so clean before and smells wonderful, my favorite is almond and lavender, and you can use it all around the house, do not leave residues and it is safe specially if you have children and/or pets. [[ASIN:B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;sMagic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 32 Ounce Bottle]].</li>
    <li> Keeps color very well! I don&#x27;t use it daily, only twice a week, but other shampoos washed the red out almost instantly, this one keeps it in much longer...and a good price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  Great shampoo for dyed red hair.</li>
    <li> This wonderful shampoo really helps to brighten up your red hair color and to make your hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair red and this shampoo works great at preserving the color. It really makes the red pop even more, actually. I love it. The shampoo is very thick and you only need a small amount for it to do the job well. It smells nice and has a pretty red/clear color. Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years. I find that it keeps my hair from fading too quickly.</li>
    <li> I used Radiant Red to help my color last longer, which it did. But unfortunately the shampoo didn&#x27;t ever want to lather and it tangled up my hair so badly that I&#x27;d have to use a lot of conditioner to untangle it. But after about a week I noticed my hair was getting VERY dry, frizzy and unmanageable. So much so that I had to flat iron my hair everyday even to put it in a pony tail because it was so straw like and fluffy. I went to get a trim and, yes I color my hair so it gets a little damaged, but the ends were so dry and damaged that my hairdresser had to cut nearly two inches off! I&#x27;m throwing the rest of this away getting some Bed Head and a good hot oil treatment to try to fix what this did to my hair.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for the red to really come through but have only used for a week. It makes my hair feel great though and helps keep my hair curly.</li>
    <li> good to have on hand for between color&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This stuff smells nice and looks okay, but as someone who has dyed my hair red for nearly 20 years, I think the coloresses sulfate free stuff you can buy at Sally or Loreal&#x27;s sulfate free line work just as well at maintaining color and cost the same or less.</li>
    <li> I am not very happy with how this shampoo (and conditioner for that matter) leaves my hair. Instead of glossy, soft, flowing hair like normal, it becomes stiff and straw-like. I&#x27;ve found that using it every three washes (about every week) helps keep my red a bit more vibrant than it normally is but doesn&#x27;t have me constantly have unmanageable hair. I wish it didn&#x27;t have this horrible side effect because it really does do what it claims in terms of the color and would use this for the rest of my life if it was like every other shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I always use Brilliant Brunette shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners, but awhile back I wanted a change so I dyed my hair red, and used the Radiant Red shampoo/conditioner. I loved it just as much as Brilliant Brunette.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year. It helps prolong my color and leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after my red started fading faster than usual; I wanted to rescue what color was left so I purchased this in the hope that i could salvage my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unfortunately, this shampoo left a sticky, nasty buildup that left my hair feeling completely damaged. It went completely limp, felt oily and literally sticky and dried out like I&#x27;d over bleached/processed my hair or something. I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair without it snagging on massive mats and knots in my usually stick straight and slippery hair:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of this mess I decided to give up on what was left of my color and use a baking soda and vinegar solution to strip the residue (whatever it was!) out of my hair. It took three days to work this stuff out of my hair and it&#x27;s finally back to normal. Thankfully what was left of the color wasn&#x27;t harmed after &#x27;stripping&#x27; my hair with the BS/vinegar solution. That&#x27;s the last time I ever use this shampoo!</li>
    <li> For anyone who has red highlights or any type of red coloring in their hair, it&#x27;s a well known fact that it FADES FAST! My dark red highlights fade in a matter of only a few short weeks. A few months ago I began using this product, and I have been thrilled with the results. The red still fades, there is nothing that can completely prevent that, but it lasts much, much longer when using Radiant Red products. My hairdresser was amazed when I went back to get my roots touched up and she asked what on earth I had been using to keep my red from fading. If you want to prolong your red, this is the way to go! And absolutely use together with Radiant Red conditioner!</li>
    <li> My hair was a dingy dark brownish strawberry blonde.  I have been using the system and my hair just seems brighter, slightly redder and really shiny.  Everyone thinks my hair actually looks *lighter*  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair looking good and doesn&#x27;t let it fade as fast. Nice feel to your hair, mine being fine.</li>
    <li> This product helped my red rinse last so much longer than usual. I normally would have to put another rinse in my hair so much sooner as other shampoos have washed out the red color I added. Love it.</li>
    <li> The title of this item says \\&quot;2-pack\\&quot;. I was expecting two bottles of shampoo. Only got one. This item is not accurately described.</li>
    <li> Paired with the Red Shampoo this conditioner doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy at all!!! Silky manageable locks that shine like there is not tomorrow!  Amazon does a great job on the value!</li>
    <li> Red is such a high maintenance color.  This product definitely makes your color last much much longer.</li>
    <li> This was beyond a disappointment.  It not only faded the RED not enhanced it.  Dryed my hair also.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works great for bringing out highlights and also leaves your hair soft and shiny. Even though it is costly, I guess Im willing to pay the couple bucks more for my natural red hair. :D</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for redheads. I can not find it in the stores at all. You can find other colors blondes etc. but not for redheads. Thank heavens I can get it here. Please don&#x60;t consider not making it. Redheads are out there.</li>
    <li> Great product to remove hair dye!</li>
    <li> Big promises, no results.  This did NOTHING to hold on to my color, which was gone within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I often dye my hair different shades or reds, from dark to light. Every time I find that within a week it&#x27;ll start fading and that within the month I&#x27;ll be back to my normal brown hair with that tint of red that never goes away. I decided to buy this to see if it would beat out having to dye my hair once a month to keep up. I did not buy the matching conditioner, I just use the conditioner that comes with the dye. It works WAY better than I thought it would. At the end of the first week when my hair looked exactly the way it was when I dyed it I was a little shocked. By the end of the first month my hair had lost maybe 5% of the color it originally had whereas normally I&#x27;d be down 75% back to my natural color. I dyed my hair around the middle of December and it is now March and my hair is STILL atleast 80% of the color it originally was. Coworkers of mine who also dye their hair ask me constantly if I&#x27;ve redyed and what I&#x27;ve been doing to keep up the color. If you ever have to dye your hair any color of red this is a necessity. It has already paid for itself in redyes.</li>
    <li> It helps keeping the red tones on your hair so you don&#x27;t have to go as often to the salon.</li>
    <li> This was a great shampoo for keeping my hair red after I dyed it. It protected my color and kept my hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product in stores in the past to use on my color treated red hair. I only wash my hair once every three or four days to keep my color going and I noticed my color start to fade after only 2 or 3 weeks of using this product along with the matching conditioner. it doesn&#x27;t prolong color any more than using regular shampoo does. The product does not perform as advertised and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo hoping that it would help my red hair dye last longer, but no complete opposite. This shampoo is really strong, and it removes so much of my red with each shampoo. I would never repurchase this product. It may work well on natural red hair, but definitely not my dyed red hair. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. The first time I used it, I had my hair dyed with the John Frieda Radiant Red shade 3VR. That is a permanent hair color and it managed to dull it and remove the color. I figured it should work since it is the same brand and same product line. It doesn&#x27;t add red or help color last as it claims. Since this shampoo faded that dye so quickly I purchased Manic Panic hair dye in Vampire Red to refreshen my red. It worked amazing, and I am continuing to use the Vampire Red dye about every month to maintain my red hair. I recently gave this shampoo another try on my freshly dyed hair, big mistake. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. It removed much of the dye and now I even have some splotchy spots. I wish this shampoo truly did work, as I have not found any shampoo that is great for dyed red hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of this shampoo if you have dyed vibrant red hair!</li>
    <li> Good price, and quick delivery.</li>
