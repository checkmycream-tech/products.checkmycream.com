      <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>-ta try it cause I&#x27;m gonna buy me some more before this sells out</li>
      <li>OK</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, definitely better than nothing, but leaves a bit to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most of the handmade soaps I have tried are so over scented</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a DE shaver for many years now.</li>
      <li>All in all, I enjoyed the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more efficient than any of the costly multi blade cartridge razors.</li>
      <li>I have tried several shaving soaps with varying degrees of satisfaction, but this is the best I have used.</li>
      <li>I couple it with Barberry Coast after shave, although I like to use that as more of a hair tonic.</li>
      <li>-ta try it cause I&#x27;m gonna buy me some more before this sells out</li>
      <li>The smell is ok somewhat musky</li>
      <li>and then I have to use ANOTHER product after shaving that has even more stuff in it that I have never heard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The later is perfect and my skin feels nice and smooth from the shea butter.</li>
      <li>but I have grown to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I also love their Bay Rum</li>
      <li>I love this shave</li>
      <li>It produces a nice lather and provides for a smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>It has a very light scent, but it smells very clean.</li>
      <li>Scent was very clean, I would describe it as creamy with shea butter being the most dominant aroma.</li>
      <li>There are others that rate higher in this price range, but I think it&#x27;s a good &amp;#34;easy beginner&amp;#34; soap.</li>
      <li>I can easily get a nice lather going fairly quickly, and it provides a very smooth shaving experience.</li>
      <li>I can say this, I was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>Very smooth shave, as smooth as I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>This was one of my first shave pucks I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;m more familiar with creams), however, I believe this to be a good soap.</li>
      <li>but I tend to enjoy citrus scents the most.</li>
      <li>Takes a strong arm like me a minute to do it</li>
      <li>I was actually in a hurry and was glad there was no struggle working up a very nice lather.</li>
      <li>Good size soap, but still fits in my normal size shaving dish.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the soap performed fine.</li>
      <li>Leaves your face feeling smooth and moisturized and smells pretty nice too.  </li>
      <li>The soap is ok however, the lather disappeared quickly.</li>
      <li>I can say it feels great on my skin, keeps it moist, and if I cut myself I simply apply I dollop of the lather to the spot and the bleeding stops VERY quickly.  </li>
      <li>To begin with I am a huge fan of Barberry Coast&#x27;s Bay Rum Aftershave.</li>
      <li>I made two passes and a light cleanup pass</li>
      <li>The glide is fantastic and I get fewer nicks or none at all with this soap.  </li>
      <li>you deal with using cheap shaving creams.  </li>
      <li>This is a lightly scented soap.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic. ..</li>
      <li>Smells great, reminiscent of olden days soap, nice lather, decent size.</li>
      <li>The lather is a creamy substantial foam that ensures a good shave, The fragrance is subtle and the glide is great.</li>
      <li>When I heard they were coming out with a shaving soap, I have to admit I got really excited.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> save some money... buy this sahving soap.. goes a long way</li>
    <li> Great lather, love the light scent. Very smooth shave, as smooth as I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> One of the first soaps I had ever bought and after buying soaps from R&amp;R, I went back to this. The smell is hands down authentic and one of the noticeable differences right off the bat was the amount of water needed. This soap likes water! and it took me a few tries but I have grown to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also perfected my lather technique after using this soap - lol.</li>
    <li> I ordered it on Amazon Prime and received it two days later. I waited to take my shower and shave until it arrived. I have been wet shaving a little under a year and building lather with a soap has been difficult for me but I am improving! Ascent gave me my best lather yet. I do three passes every morning and had plenty of thick, slick lather. It has a very nice scent that is low key. I&#x27;ve been getting the best shaves of the year since this arrived. I also love their Bay Rum After shave and Havana shave balm.</li>
    <li> The shaving soap arrived exactly when expected and is very useful for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  I think it was a bit over-priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a DE shaver for many years now. It&#x27;s more efficient than any of the costly multi blade cartridge razors. The Ascent shave soap is a perfect blend of ingredients to give you a smooth shave and leaves a delicious aroma to arouse primal feelings in your lover(s). I couple it with Barberry Coast after shave, although I like to use that as more of a hair tonic. Fantastic. ..</li>
    <li> Great lather and scent.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Had razor bumps and now it&#x27;s pretty much gone. Lasts a very long time too.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap twice with identical results.  First the positives.  This soap smells really good when it is wet.  It produces a thick lather that you would think would result in a rich, wet, lubricating shave.  The problem is that this soap dried very quickly on my face, in the bowl, and on my brush.  It simply did not retain the moisture and lubricating qualities I need for a smooth, nick-free shave.  As a result, both times I used it I received many nicks and weepers, even using brand new blades and a couple of my favorite razors with which I consistently shave nick-free.  Hence, I have relegated this puck to the shower dish where I will use it as ordinary body soap, and move on.  I would not recommend this for shaving when I have discovered several products that work so much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not buying this just because I think the reviews are shady.  Look at the dates all the 5 star reviews saying this soap is one step away from shaving with God himself&#x27;s tears. Real sketchy.  Don&#x27;t trust it.</li>
    <li> Great product. lathers very well</li>
    <li> I like this shavesoap a lot. I used it in a marvy mug, which fit it perfectly, the day i got it and it easily lathered and held its lather throughout my shave. I would recommend this to anyone looking to try a soap outside of the standard names. Subtle aroma with whipped cream smooth lather that holds and rinses off your blade easily while shaving. Mixed with Crux balm or a eucamenth after, its a secret weapon</li>
    <li> Scent is okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is glycerin it&#x27;s pretty hard to lather (note: I have very hard water)</li>
    <li> The scent isn&#x27;t that strong, or good. For each of these infractions I remove one star. I should remove another for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells great, reminiscent of olden days soap, nice lather, decent size. I just wish it were also sold in a handy travel size with compact container or perhaps as a stick. But for home use it is marvelous and I expect to buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Good size soap, but still fits in my normal size shaving dish. Lathers quickly and is richer than other soaps I&#x27;ve tried. Recommend that you ensure you drain the dish and rotate the soap every few days to ensure the bottom portion of the soap doesn&#x27;t stay wet and &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;. After a week and a half it appears that this one will last as longer as advertised.</li>
    <li> This soap produces a lot of lather with only a little water. The lather stays on my face longer than other brands and supports a great shave.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s beard is very dense and heavy this is so much better for his face than any of the other products that he has tried. I purchased it for Valentines Day, it did not arrive on time which was horrible but it will be reordered because in just the past few weeks the change in his beard is remarkable. Well worth the wait! nice clean smell too!</li>
    <li> Great soap.  The puck is smaller than my over sized shave mug and rather non-pliable so I put them both in the microwave for a minute or so and then let it re-harden at the bottom of the mug.  Worked great. The smell is nice, it lathers well.</li>
    <li> When I was a kid, shaving was something fun.  Especially for a 12 year old showing off to all his peers, and yes I did start shaving at 12.  However the fun was not to last.  My beard is thick and when I say thick I go through razors pretty quickly which made me change to a Muhle Open Comb razor with feather brand razors in recent years to save money, which I love by the way.  Since then I&#x27;ve tried many gels, creams, soaps and either it didn&#x27;t glide enough or I got severe allergic reactions on my neck.  Later, I settled on Alba&#x27;s moisturizing coconut cream shave but it is no longer produced unfortunately leaving me to find a new shaving cream.  Enter Ascent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather:&lt;br /&gt;This soap foams up a lot, and when I say a lot I mean a lot.  As you can see in the first photo there is quite a bit of lather just seconds after mixing the soap.  I&#x27;ve heard some reviewers say that the soap does not stand up well over time and dries quickly.  This simply is NOT TRUE!  The same lather is shown in the next photo just an hour afterwards, and the last one is overnight.  As you can see, so long as you finish your shave in under an night you&#x27;ll be okay.  Jokes aside, the foam is good with a consistency of beaten egg whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend wetting the tips of your badger bristles with HOT water and moving in a clockwise fashion then do some stabbing motions followed by swiping side to side and then repeat those steps again adding water if needed.  You SHOULDN&#x27;T need much water to make a lather.  Use too much and the oils will not emulsify to make the creamy lather that wont dissipate in minutes (think mayonnaise).  Takes a strong arm like me a minute to do it and I have a crappy brush.  Also when it hits water in the sink, it will not dissolve readily and looks kinda like whip cream in the washing sink.&lt;br /&gt;5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice.  It reminds me of pine with hints of clove and cinnamon.  There&#x27;s some sandalwood in there too mixed with strong fragrances of the forest and mountain air from a hike.  It isn&#x27;t too strong so it won&#x27;t overpower your aftershave if you wish to use it after your shave, but it can feel weak at times.  I like to finish with Aubrey&#x27;s organics Men&#x27;s stock Spice Island.&lt;br /&gt;4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glide:&lt;br /&gt;It slices, it dices, and it gets my face smoother with the first application then two of any other brand.  To let you know where I&#x27;m coming from I typically like gels for their glide as they help hold the hairs in place while giving a cushion with their gummy texture to ease the blade through such as Alba&#x27;s moisturizing coconut cream shave (now discontinued).  The glide is fantastic and I get fewer nicks or none at all with this soap.  However, I do need to go a bit slower at times because this isn&#x27;t a gel and doesn&#x27;t provide the cushion you would expect from one either.&lt;br /&gt;4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin:&lt;br /&gt;For most people this is something you&#x27;ll know when it touches you and it will be different for everyone.  You may be allergic to the fragrances or concentration of a certain oil or whatever.  I can say it feels great on my skin, keeps it moist, and if I cut myself I simply apply I dollop of the lather to the spot and the bleeding stops VERY quickly.  Sometimes I&#x27;ve had massacres on my face but even if I mess up bad with this soap I don&#x27;t need to look like a mummy before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin due to my dermatitis which I get around my beard often after shaving due to irritating my skin so in shame I used to often shave the night before and applied some creams to my face to soothe my skin.  However, because of the oils in this soap, I&#x27;m happy to say I don&#x27;t need to do that anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make your shave easier I recommend putting a lather on first to wake up your whiskers, waiting a few minutes, rinsing it off, and then reapplying a new lather to begin shaving.&lt;br /&gt;5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lifespan:&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve done maybe ten or so shaves and played with thelather several times to see what I can get out of it.  The puck has not changed, at all!  This is one solid soap puck and I believe it when they say this will last you 3-6 months which again saves me money keeping the Kraken of Moria at bay.&lt;br /&gt;5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I really like this soap a lot.  Due not that this isn&#x27;t the same as the soap you use to wash yourself.  My mother when I was kid told me, &amp;#34;what&#x27;s the difference.&amp;#34;  I thought so too or at least I did back then, so after shaving with regular soap I showed her and she swore never to let me use body soap on my face as a kid ever again.  The fact is us guys do need a special lather for the face high in fats such as coconut and other oils in a certain ratio with hydroxides to help clean and groom our faces.  The smell is great, the shave is great, I think you ought-ta try it cause I&#x27;m gonna buy me some more before this sells out too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall 23/25 or a 92%lather several times to see what I can get out of it.

The smell is great, the shave is great, I think you ought-ta try it cause I&#x27;m gonna buy me some more before this sells out too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall 23/25 or a 92%</li>
    <li> It makes a nice lather, can&#x27;t say its any better than some of the less expensive options out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using shaving soaps for only a few months having used around 8-10 different soaps. This one is right up there with some of the top soaps I currently use. Gets a great lather very quickly and provides a very good cushion to my shave. Good scent and my face felt great after the shave. The only thing is I wish it were a little softer to mash down into my own container. Truly a great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome soap! Have to say this is one of the fastest lathering soaps I have used. I was actually in a hurry and was glad there was no struggle working up a very nice lather. Slickness was also really good, no problem making multiple passes without having to relather; which is where many soaps fail. Scent was very clean, I would describe it as creamy with shea butter being the most dominant aroma. All in all very pleased with my purchase and performance of this soap.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving soap. I&#x27;ve tried a good number of higher end shaving soaps, and this is certainly right there with the best of them. It provides great lather and great slickness during the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes -&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light and pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;Its a hard soap, you cannot push your finger into it.&lt;br /&gt;Very good post shave feel.&lt;br /&gt;Some shaving soaps will bother my neck, I think its an ingredient related to the scent, this soap caused zero irritation or redness for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try Barberry&#x27;s new Kohana sensitive skin post shave product when that is released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good soap that I would buy again and is now part of my regular shave rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!&lt;br /&gt;Greg</li>
    <li> NOT BAD SHOULD LAST. WAY TOO MUCH MONEY. $15.00 OK BUT $25.00 PLUS SHIPPING OVER PRICED.</li>
    <li> Although this is advertised as all natural, the scent is activating my fragrance allergies.  I can&#x27;t stand the smell or even being in the same room with it. My husband (for whom I bought it) assures me it smells fine, but the scent makes me sick.  Amazon was great about return and refund, but I am disappointed since it sounded so good. If you are sensitive to fragrances, beware- this stinks!</li>
    <li> Great product and showed up fast!</li>
    <li> This is incredible shaving soap...rich lather, no irritating ingredients.  You actually need very little on the brush.  One puck of this soap would last EASILY two or three months with daily shaving.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for any style of shaving.  I use a Parker Double Edge Heavyweight with Astra blades...both a great deal.</li>
    <li> I switched back to wet shaving a couple of years ago. I prefer soaps over creams because they lather good with my brush and clean off easy without leaving anything behind. Most of the handmade soaps I have tried are so over scented and I don&#x27;t like smelling like a pine tree. My current soap was about gone and I was looking to try something new. I had a friend suggest Barberry Coast because he really liked the after shave they make. I decided to give it try and now I&#x27;m hooked. The scent is great! its not overpowering but its a good &amp;#34;Manly&amp;#34; smell. The later is perfect and my skin feels nice and smooth from the shea butter. I highly recommend Ascent and will continue to watch what other quality products Barberry brings to market.</li>
    <li> I have tried several shaving soaps with varying degrees of satisfaction, but this is the best I have used. The lather is a creamy substantial foam that ensures a good shave, The fragrance is subtle and the glide is great. Nice product! I recommend this soap to all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  It produces a nice lather and provides for a smooth shave.  Leaves your face feeling smooth and moisturized and smells pretty nice too.  I&#x27;d expect it to last a pretty long time.  Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This was one of my first shave pucks I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;m more familiar with creams), however, I believe this to be a good soap. It has a very light scent, but it smells very clean. The lather it creates is very thick, loading a brush for just a few seconds will give you more than enough for multiple passes. Putting this in comparison to other soaps I&#x27;d say its a little expensive, but its still good quality. I&#x27;d definitely recommend the company in general as they have great customer service and an active social media presence. All in all, I enjoyed the product.</li>
    <li> To begin with I am a huge fan of Barberry Coast&#x27;s Bay Rum Aftershave. When I heard they were coming out with a shaving soap, I have to admit I got really excited. I alternate different types of soap such as Arko, Proraso, Cella when I shave...just to mix things up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I let my stubble grow a couple days so when the Ascent came in Id be ready. I can say this, I was not disappointed! This stuff lathers up extremely well. After a few passes with my brush, my youngest son thought Santa had stopped by.&lt;br /&gt;The Shea butter and coconut oil are there and feels nice on the skin. The scent is a nice touch. Definitely has a pleasant aroma that takes you to an exotic locale, even if it&#x27;s only in your mind. Id have to say...we can&#x27;t all be &amp;#34;Indiana Jones&amp;#34; ...but we certainly can share his penchant for adventure each morning with razor in hand. This stuff is good. Seriously.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Will continue to use in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Nice thick lather, performs great and the scent is very nice! I will definitely be buying this again and I will also check out their aftershave. Thanks again Barberry Coast for this awesome soap.</li>
    <li> works like a champ. this is good stuff here, the smell is amazing and the use is so easy</li>
    <li> I had never used a shaving soap before, but I was getting really tired of junk you deal with using cheap shaving creams.  I have a serious problem skin irritation after shaving most of the time, especially on my neck - and then I have to use ANOTHER product after shaving that has even more stuff in it that I have never heard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that Barberry Coast had a shave soap without all of the chemicals, I decided to give it a try - I mean it is guaranteed anyways, so what do I have to lose, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you notice is the awesome smell - It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it is this great woodsy, musky smell with a little citrus to it.  The lather was super thick, and unlike anything I have ever used before.  It was definitely a little different, but it was different in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest thing for me was the fact that I had no irritation after the fact, and no discomfort during my shave.  For someone with sensitive skin, this is a big deal.  The whole experience was different, and I imagine that this is probably how shaving is supposed to actually feel.</li>
    <li> The puck is hard, kind of like Williams. Hits the bottom of the mug like a brick. I figure this is good since those types of soaps tend to last a long time. I would most likely get at least 100 shaves out of this puck. Off the bat my wife said she really liked the scent. I smell cedar, pine, musk and a hint of citrus. The scent grew on me as I lathered it. I kind of like it. Definitely masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LATHER: 5/5 - The soap lathered extremely well. I was surprised. I hardly had to do any brush loading and I had a very thirsty peaky lather that just kept taking water. It went onto my face nice and thick. Thickness is the key feature to this soap&#x27;s lather. I rarely give a full 5 for lather but wow this stuff lathered up super nice with no effort at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CUSHION: 4/5 - Again with the thickness, which provided good cushion for the shave. I have no irritation from the shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SLICKNESS: 2/5 - This is not a slick soap. With one swipe of the razor I can grab the skin underneath for stretching and it does not slip at all. There wasn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;lubrication&amp;#34; for a straight razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOISTURIZING: 3/5 - Kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; on the moisturizer front. I normally just wipe my face after shaving and leave the soap in my skin so I get the moisturizing effect through the day. My face feels a bit dry today. It&#x27;s okay, definitely better than nothing, but leaves a bit to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROTECTION: 4/5 - I have no irritation from the shave. The blade did not skip or burn at all. I made two passes and a light cleanup pass and my skin is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT STRENGTH: 4/5 - Scent has decent strength and some staying power. I can still pick up whiffs of it a couple of hours later. My wife likes the scent so that is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: 22/30 - I think I would buy this soap again. There are others that rate higher in this price range, but I think it&#x27;s a good &amp;#34;easy beginner&amp;#34; soap.</li>
    <li> The soap is ok however, the lather disappeared quickly. I loaded my Omega 49 and head lathered. My brush was full of soap when I set it down but when I picked it up for the second pass the lather was gone. Otherwise, the soap performed fine. The smell is ok somewhat musky but I tend to enjoy citrus scents the most.</li>
    <li> Only used this shave soap twice so far but it lathers nice and seems to keep my head from getting as dry as regular shave soap...&lt;br /&gt;Its a harder soap so I think it will last much longer also...</li>
    <li> Great shave soap!  A few swirls of the brush quickly builds a thick, slick lather.  This arrived as a hard heavy puck, it wouldn’t fit in my (wide/short) container so I got out the cheese grater and milled it myself.  Pressed the shavings into the shave soap container then smoothed it in with my fingers and now it looks like I bought it this way.  This is a lightly scented soap.  If you are looking for a fill the bathroom stay with you all day type scent, check out Taylor of Old Bond Street products.  If are sensitive to strong smells or just want a light, refreshing scent then Ascent is for you you.</li>
    <li> This is in the top running for the best shave soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a nice, thick lather and provides great lubrication. I wish the scent was a little stronger because it&#x27;s so nice and tends to get covered up by my pre-shave balm and after-shave lotion.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for the best shave as I get a lot of razor burns but this was not for me</li>
    <li> Really not big on the slickness, smells nice and clean tho however it dried out my face more than others I use.    Update!!   I use it in the shower as a preshaver seems to do the trick, I did not enjoy shaving with it tho. Gooduck!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this. It smells wonderful. Will follow up as needed.</li>
    <li> Inflated repackaged product. Henry cavendish sells the same product for half the price. I&#x27;ll stick with true artisan soap makers and not carnival barkers trying to get rich off of hard working people.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and performing soap!!!! Lather whipped up very quickly and extremely slick. Had No irritation after shave with a straight razor. Scent was light with a vanilla/coconut mixed with an orange/citrusy hint to it, it&#x27;s hard to describe but definitely one of my best smelling soaps.  I hope they make an aftershave to match.</li>
    <li> I like how it peaks and that it stay&#x27;s as a thick soap and smells great my only complaint is that it drys out to fast. I shave after I&#x27;m done with my shower the first time I used it my face was wet I lathered it up put it on my face and It dryed as soon as I completed putting it on. The second time I Shaved it did the same but I but some oil on my face first same results now this could be because of my skin type for the price it&#x27;s worth the try and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a great lather I have enough for 3 passes and still some left over I do use a synthetic brush as well.</li>
    <li> Great lather and smells great too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving soap for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m loving it.  I can easily get a nice lather going fairly quickly, and it provides a very smooth shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I love this shave bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to a brief image based review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://steller.co/stories/348385201719608559</li>
