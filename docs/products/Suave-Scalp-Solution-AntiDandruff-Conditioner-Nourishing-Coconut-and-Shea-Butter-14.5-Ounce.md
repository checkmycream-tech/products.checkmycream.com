      <li>It&#x27;s not intrusive, but pleasant when you catch a whiff of it.</li>
      <li>Works good, my wife loves it</li>
      <li>I just hope more people discover this product so it stays on the market for good!</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s cheap, but it leaves my hair and scalp feeling great</li>
      <li>Maybe it was just my scalp, but this product did not help me although the smell of it was amazing.</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell too.</li>
      <li>The product smells great and may be just fine for most.  </li>
      <li>is so much more gentle on my hair and scalp, plus more affective and smells great!</li>
      <li>smells great and worth every penny</li>
      <li>The price is pretty great as well.  </li>
      <li>I always used AntiDandruff shampoo, which worked ok.  </li>
      <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I think it works better than shampoo because I leave it on longer.</li>
      <li>Works excellent for dry scalp.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, this conditions quite well and reduces frizz on my wavy/lightly curly hair.</li>
      <li>I started using AntiDandruff conditioner and regular shampoo, and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Smells wonderful but not a strong scent that lasts, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your perfume.  </li>
      <li>Smells great too and is safe for everyday usage.</li>
      <li>(yes, guys with short hair, using conditioner lol) my hair is too long for me to use conditioner on my roots but its good stuff anyways</li>
      <li>As expected, this is also great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it with different shampoos and it seems to be just as effective.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant but not overpowering, and in addition to fighting dandruff the product does make my hair softer and less tangled as well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy so far, as my scalp seems less itchy pretty much immediately.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different anti dandruff shampoos and conditioners, but this one is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>The coconut smell is very nice, and seems to last on your hair very lightly for a few hours after use.</li>
      <li>we love it,  the entire family uses it,</li>
      <li>My local store stopped carrying it, so I am grateful to still be able to find it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
      <li>I find this product gentle enough to use every day, and I&#x27;ve also noticed it doesn&#x27;t strip the color from my dyed hair as quickly as the harsher dandruff products.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and the shampoo as well.</li>
      <li>great for thick curly long hair does not strip your natural oils.</li>
      <li>I live with three guys who&#x27;ve all started using this</li>
      <li>it controls itch few days and they keep hair healthy and shiny, I feel softer scalp for few days more than when I wash with the regular type</li>
      <li>/&gt;Apparently your scalp issues DO acclimatize to the product you use over time, so I&#x27;ve started to switch out to new products as my old ones run out.</li>
      <li>We had the coconut shampoo, which we liked, so we bought the conditioner - a bit tough to find in stores.  </li>
      <li>After 3-4 uses, my dandruff is completely gone.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels silky soft and the flaking has stopped.  </li>
      <li>I use this with the shampoo and the two work well for me at controlling dandruff and keeping my hair feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>I had dandruff, and no other conditioner worked for me before.</li>
      <li>This conditioner has been the only product to completely eliminate the problem.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about trying another Suave dandruff product after trying other formulations of their products that didn&#x27;t work, but this stuff is amazing!  </li>
      <li>This conditioner actually works, and it left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>My review is higher since it&#x27;s based solely on my personal experience, and not a true test of quality or general comment regarding effectiveness.  </li>

    <li> we have very hard water so dandruff treatment is necessary. I live with three guys who&#x27;ve all started using this (yes, guys with short hair, using conditioner lol) my hair is too long for me to use conditioner on my roots but its good stuff anyways</li>
    <li> great product great service</li>

    <li> Maybe it was just my scalp, but this product did not help me although the smell of it was amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Works excellent for dry scalp. We order this in bulk in our home, just wish they still sold the shampoo!</li>
    <li> Waiting for coconuts to sprout on my head.  Works good, my wife loves it and so do I.  Unisex solution to a great conditioner and shampoo.  Yikes!  Looks like the price has recently gone up?  Coconuts on the endangered species list?</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful but not a strong scent that lasts, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your perfume.  It does help my dry scalp, and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  I do use a conditioner with it as my hair is colored.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about trying another Suave dandruff product after trying other formulations of their products that didn&#x27;t work, but this stuff is amazing!

    <li> I like suave Antidandruff products, they work well , it controls itch few days and they keep hair healthy and shiny, I feel softer scalp for few days more than when I wash with the regular type</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different anti dandruff shampoos and conditioners, but this one is my favorite so far. It got me through last winter with the least dandruff I&#x27;ve seen in years.

    <li> I had dandruff, and no other conditioner worked for me before. This is the best conditioner that has worked for me for a while.</li>
    <li> My skin was so dry and flaky this winter. I tried the Suave coconut and saw great improvement. I have reordered since and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product for its effectiveness and it&#x27;s price. Smells great too and is safe for everyday usage. Double thumbs up!</li>
    <li> great for thick curly long hair does not strip your natural oils. has coconut and shea butter which is great. smells great and worth every penny</li>
    <li> I use this product with Suave AntiDandruff Shampoo and both has aided in getting rid of my dandruff.  I used to use the stronger dandruff shampoos such as Head and Shoulders but Suave is so much more gentle on my hair and scalp, plus more affective and smells great!</li>
    <li> With regular use it works well at keeping dandruff at bay, but dry scalp still requires moisturizing from other products</li>
    <li> Works great.  I always used AntiDandruff shampoo, which worked ok.  I started using AntiDandruff conditioner and regular shampoo, and it works great.  I think it works better than shampoo because I leave it on longer. This stuff works as well as anything else I have tried, I don&#x27;t notice any flakes.  I wish the scent was a little stronger, but that is about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff all of my life, and have been reading up on whether there is a way to permanently get rid of dandruff. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;curable&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used Selsun blue for as long as I can remember, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently your scalp issues DO acclimatize to the product you use over time, so I&#x27;ve started to switch out to new products as my old ones run out. I&#x27;m now using this with the Selsun blue (I used to use a deep conditioner, and it had no antidandruff properties.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy so far, as my scalp seems less itchy pretty much immediately. It&#x27;s only been a couple of days of use so far, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic drop in flakes, but hope for less of them, of course. Most importantly, this conditions quite well and reduces frizz on my wavy/lightly curly hair. The coconut smell is very nice, and seems to last on your hair very lightly for a few hours after use. It&#x27;s not intrusive, but pleasant when you catch a whiff of it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this based on all the great reviews.  Unfortunately this Conditioner (with accompanying shampoo) made my hair dry and limp.  The product smells great and may be just fine for most.  My review is higher since it&#x27;s based solely on my personal experience, and not a true test of quality or general comment regarding effectiveness.  I didn&#x27;t want to give the product 2 stars with such a subjective criterion.</li>
    <li> I use this with the shampoo and the two work well for me at controlling dandruff and keeping my hair feeling soft.  Nice smell too.</li>
    <li> We had the coconut shampoo, which we liked, so we bought the conditioner - a bit tough to find in stores.  As expected, this is also great.</li>
