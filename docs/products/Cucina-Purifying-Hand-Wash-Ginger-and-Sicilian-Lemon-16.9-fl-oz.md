      <li>The scents are amazing - this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The price here (plus free shipping withe Prime) was too good to beat, though, so I went ahead and ordered two.</li>
      <li>It is also nice that the container can easily be refilled.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years now, and I am still very much in love with the scent and texture</li>
      <li>This is such a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.  </li>
      <li>I love the zucchini and truffle one</li>
      <li>This hand wash is great to have at the sink in your kitchen - it really cuts the grease and oders.  </li>
      <li>She reported that she liked the original bottle she received and likes this too.</li>

      <li>Enjoyed using it very much.  </li>
      <li>Very high quality soap &amp; love the smell &amp; conditioning qualities.</li>
      <li>Love the smell but it wasn&#x27;t packaged very well.</li>
      <li>The company needs to secure the top to the bottle with plastic shrink wrap or even some sort of clear tape.</li>
      <li>Adequate packaging to prevent breakage.  </li>
      <li>and the first bottle is gone!</li>
      <li>This disappeared rather quickly so everyone in the house seemed to really like this -</li>
      <li>The bottle is pretty too</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think much about this until I went to use the soap; I was struck by how watery it was.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the availability.</li>
      <li>Really like this hand cleaner.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a refill soap in the clementine/candied ginger fragrance to go with the lotion that was part of a gift set only to find it was no longer available.  </li>
      <li>so the olive oil in the soap helps keep my hands from becoming parched and dry.  </li>
      <li>-- I find the subtle scent that many people seem to find too faint actually perfect, and this product lathers very well but doesn&#x27;t leave my hands dry after washing, like many grocery store brands.</li>
      <li>And the packaging -- how could one not love the elegant glass bottle?</li>
      <li>They were packaged extremely well with a lot of bubble wrap and tape that was contoured to the bottle - a bit hard to remove but good for glass containers, so I appreciated it.</li>
      <li>Only complaint is that the top was unscrewed inside</li>
      <li>As the other person said, there wasn&#x27;t too much leakage...less than a teaspoon.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something that would not dry my hands out.</li>

    <li> Using this in our kitchen after dumping all the anti-bac soaps.  Very high quality soap &amp; love the smell &amp; conditioning qualities.</li>
    <li> This hand wash is great to have at the sink in your kitchen - it really cuts the grease and oders.  It also smells great - a wonderful lemony/ginger scent.  I am very happy with the product and the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for hand soap in the kitchen!!  It was great to have the refill too!  Lasts longer than foam hand soap?</li>
    <li> Love the smell but it wasn&#x27;t packaged very well. Half the soap leaked out of the bottle before we got it.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now, and I am still very much in love with the scent and texture -- I find the subtle scent that many people seem to find too faint actually perfect, and this product lathers very well but doesn&#x27;t leave my hands dry after washing, like many grocery store brands. And the packaging -- how could one not love the elegant glass bottle?</li>
    <li> Beautiful, heavy glass bottle and lovely lemon scented soap.  Adequate packaging to prevent breakage.  Only complaint is that the top was unscrewed inside it&#x27;s bubble wrap packaging.  I could smell the lemon scent when I opened the box.  I read this leakage issue in another comment before I bought this, but didn&#x27;t expect it was still happening.  As the other person said, there wasn&#x27;t too much leakage...less than a teaspoon.  But this should never happen.  The company needs to secure the top to the bottle with plastic shrink wrap or even some sort of clear tape.</li>
    <li> I bought this Hand Wash for the kitchen and am very pleased with the purchase.  The soap comes in a very nice glass bottle (not plastic!) with the best pump I&#x27;ve seen in a soap dispenser.  The Ginger/Lemon aroma is just right...not too strong.  I definitely plan to purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful as I have used it before.  Unfortuantely it arrived broken so I could not use it or the other item in the box.  I spent hours trying to figure out how to report it ot amazon but, could not find a customer service email or phone number on the website.  I got so frustrated, I never want to order anything on amazon again.  The cucina soaps are great.  I love the zucchini and truffle one but, they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed using it very much.  Would recommend it to any lady who enjoys fine hand soap.Thanks for the availability.It is great soap.</li>
    <li> The best soap for the kitchen-worth the price</li>
    <li> Great product! I would definitely recommend to others.  This product smells great and leaves a nice smooth feeling on your hands.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a refill soap in the clementine/candied ginger fragrance to go with the lotion that was part of a gift set only to find it was no longer available.  This Ginger/Sicilian lemon scent soap works nicely with the clementine/ginger lotion, it&#x27;s a light, refreshing, and clean scent. I wash my hands a lot while working in the kitchen so the olive oil in the soap helps keep my hands from becoming parched and dry.  I love the lotion and so was happy to find a replacement that complements it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It just has a really clean and fresh smell to it, without being overwhelming.  It is also nice that the container can easily be refilled.</li>
    <li> This disappeared rather quickly so everyone in the house seemed to really like this - I use it on the kitchen sink for hand-washing.</li>
    <li> Great scent and removes cooking odors from hands.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 bottles of the hand soap for our home.  I was looking for something that would not dry my hands out. And this is the one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Cucina products for a long time and have always bought them from retail stores in the past. The scents are amazing - this is my favorite. The price here (plus free shipping withe Prime) was too good to beat, though, so I went ahead and ordered two. They were packaged extremely well with a lot of bubble wrap and tape that was contoured to the bottle - a bit hard to remove but good for glass containers, so I appreciated it. Problem was, the tops had been unscrewed, and soap had spilled out all over both bottles (wrapped separately). I didn&#x27;t think much about this until I went to use the soap; I was struck by how watery it was. When I&#x27;ve bought Cucina liquid soap in the past, it has always had a thicker consistency (the same as other liquid soaps). In fact, I&#x27;ve only had it a month or so and the first bottle is gone! I&#x27;ve had 4oz. grocery store soaps that have lasted longer, not to mention soaps like Mrs. Myers, Molton Brown, and Claus Porto. Don&#x27;t know what the deal is, whether the company has changed its formula, though I have to wonder about the unscrewed tops... Very disappointing. I&#x27;d expected 2 bottles to last me several months, at least. That said, it still smells great.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to be delivered to a family member. She reported that she liked the original bottle she received and likes this too.</li>
    <li> Really like this hand cleaner. I have it in my bathroom, but you can use it in the kitchen too. Very mild, with a wonderful scent. The bottle is pretty too</li>
