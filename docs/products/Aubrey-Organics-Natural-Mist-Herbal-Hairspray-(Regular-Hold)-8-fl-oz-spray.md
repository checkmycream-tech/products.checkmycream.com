      <li>benefit of this product is that it&#x27;s incredibly safe.  </li>
      <li>It does keep my hair in place, but I do notice that at the end of the day, I have more strands that have fallen.</li>

      <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I found this hairspray.</li>
      <li>(see the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics at [...]) and READ LABELS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Aubrey never failed me !!!</li>
      <li>I like the fragrance used, but I&#x27;m sure there are those that would feel it&#x27;s a bit strong and may clash with any perfume worn while using it.  </li>
      <li>I love that there isnt a strong smell when you use this hairspray.</li>
      <li>Great soft hold that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the super hold and found that it makes my hair crunchy but the regular hold is perfect.</li>
      <li>This herbal spray is just what I need: not too strong and not too light hold.</li>
      <li>This is the best soft hold natural spray on the market.</li>
      <li>That was before I realized how important it was not to use toxic</li>
      <li>search for cruelty free hairspray continues...</li>
      <li>My health is way too important to me.  </li>
      <li>It doesnt seem to hold as good as some chemcially commercial ones, but I like that this product is better for your body.</li>
      <li>Wonderful hold without making hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
      <li>Just the right light hold.  </li>
      <li>Love that its safe, and holds decent, but it just doesn&#x27;t have as much hold as my curly hair needs</li>
      <li>I like to THINK that it works, I does have an ok hold, not stiff, light</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>although I haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; version of this product.  </li>
      <li>I like their Super hold, too, for a couple of recalcitrant spots at the nape of my neck.</li>
      <li>I have always used \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; hairspray.</li>
      <li>This is the first cruelty free hairspray I have tried.</li>
      <li>Works better than any name brand hairspray, and it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
      <li>think it smells really good, but the scent is strong and lingers for a few hours.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is made of all natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>natur al misst hairspray regular is a nice holding spray</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
      <li>Love that it is natural.</li>
      <li>I feel like I have to use quite a bit of hairspray to get the effect I want (anti-frizz in a humid environment), but that may be because the bottle has a mister top instead of the continuous flow that most other (aerosol) hairsprays have.</li>
      <li>if any smell (cant remember right now)</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t offer as much hold as I expected, but was very good considering all natural ingredients, would certainly buy again.</li>
      <li>This hairspray is very light, especially, when comparing to the superhold.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind that the regular hold is much more lighter than I had</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and have been using this exact product for years</li>
      <li>Extra holds MUCH MUCH better.</li>
      <li>Its not a big deal thou, as most of my hair will stay in place.</li>
      <li>It has a pretty natural look and feel to it, and it just has a clean, herbal scent to it.</li>
      <li>The balsam oil gives it a clean masculine scent.</li>
      <li>My hair does lose curl pretty fast though.</li>
      <li>I live in a very hot and humid area, and this hairspray works great for keeping my wavy hair from turning into a giant, frizzy mess.</li>
      <li>I tried the Super Hold Aubrey Natural hairspray, and it was like hair glue.</li>
      <li>I prefer the regular hold to the strong hold because it&#x27;s easier to comb it out when you are ready to do so.  </li>
      <li>As always, everyone is different, if you have a hair style that just needs a little discipline, this product is great for that.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I have almost completely straight</li>
      <li>I style my hair with this product by spraying just a spritz before I use a curling iron or straight iron to my hair - on medium setting.  </li>
      <li>gave the superhold bottle to my co-worker who has very curly hair, and she uses it like hair gel, spraying it on her hand and then applying it onto her hair.</li>
      <li>and I felt like it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
      <li>Does absolutely nothing in terms of styling your hair.</li>
      <li>so will only use for special occasions when I&#x27;d really want it like an interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Only thing it&#x27;s good for is putting your hair down, but you can do that by washing your hair.</li>
      <li>but it still has 3 chemicals (less than most hairsprays)</li>
      <li>I bought this to get away from all of the hairsprays with harsh chemicals, but I just didn&#x27;t love it, it didn&#x27;t hold very well</li>
      <li>My skin seemed to itch A LOT more than the \\&quot;superhold\\&quot; version, and it could be because with the superhold, I only had to use 1 pump, versus with the regular hold</li>
      <li>I have coarse thick hair and it does a great job holding my hair in place.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s probably a little better than using nothing, but</li>
      <li>your hair has if spray more than a small amount.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s natural .</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair from frizzing up around my face when I wear it up, which is really the only thing I need it for.</li>
      <li>this product because I am very health conscious and only use natural non-toxic personal care products that are as close to 100% organic as I can find.  </li>
      <li>I have tried to switch all my products to ones that arent full of harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>so if you want more than that then by their other firm hold one...</li>
      <li>: doesn&#x27;t hold as well and weighs hair down a bit when you first spray it</li>
      <li>live in a dry climate, so humidity wasn&#x27;t the issue.</li>

<li> it has some alcohol but balanced with other ingredients not dry out my hair.</li>
<li> I dont use hairspray enough to make a difference in my daily life, but I do use it a few times a month</li>
<li> That simply means there is at least one natural or organic ingredient in there.  </li>
<li> Can be combed or brushed through after a few minutes of drying.&lt;br /&gt;No chemical smell.  </li>
<li> You can fluff it with your fingers...or brush it...to refresh it without running into hairs&amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; together, as can happen with other hairsprays.</li>
<li> I did recently purchase a small sample size of Giovanni LA Hold Hair Spritz</li>
<li> I have heavy Asian hair and in the past used products like Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine hairspray that would hold my hair even in humid conditions.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this and will buy again and again and again!</li>
    <li> Arrived on great condition and got what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Total crap. Smells bad and terrible hold. Makes hair worse looking.</li>
    <li> Just the right light hold.  Can be combed or brushed through after a few minutes of drying.&lt;br /&gt;No chemical smell.  The balsam oil gives it a clean masculine scent. Leaves hair shiny.</li>
    <li> This is the best soft hold natural spray on the market. Great ingredients...it has some alcohol but balanced with other ingredients not dry out my hair. You can fluff it with your fingers...or brush it...to refresh it without running into hairs&amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; together, as can happen with other hairsprays. Note it is soft-hold so if you want more than that then by their other firm hold one...I have not tried it but based on this one I am sure its great too.  cj</li>
    <li> I style my hair with this product by spraying just a spritz before I use a curling iron or straight iron to my hair - on medium setting.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair! And it HOLDS my style!</li>
    <li> Love that its safe, and holds decent, but it just doesn&#x27;t have as much hold as my curly hair needs</li>
    <li> Was looking for a product that works well as a hairspray. This one is great and no toxic fumes to breath in!</li>
    <li> This hairspray is perfect for all styles. I use it on my dancer--keeps her hair in place without a plasticky flaky after-disaster. I use it also on straight and curly everyday styles. I will never use another spray. Love that it is natural.</li>
    <li> I like this hair spray.  Holds my upswept hair without being too &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and yet does the job.  I like their Super hold, too, for a couple of recalcitrant spots at the nape of my neck.</li>
    <li> I live in a very hot and humid area, and this hairspray works great for keeping my wavy hair from turning into a giant, frizzy mess. It has a pretty natural look and feel to it, and it just has a clean, herbal scent to it. I&#x27;m not incredibly picky about my hairspray, and I really don&#x27;t use it a whole lot. It keeps my hair from frizzing up around my face when I wear it up, which is really the only thing I need it for.</li>
    <li> Great soft hold that lasts all day. Smells fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Let me start off this review by saying that I am basing my rating on how it works as a hairspray, not on how \\&quot;natural\\&quot; it is. I gave it two stars because it smells nice and it&#x27;s probably a little better than using nothing, but I&#x27;m sitting here only 4 hours after curling my hair and I have almost completely straight strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a dry climate, so humidity wasn&#x27;t the issue. My hair does lose curl pretty fast though. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try if your hair \\&quot;likes\\&quot; being styled/curled, but if you need something for stubborn hair, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have been using this exact product for years I hope they never stop making it</li>
    <li> Works better than any name brand hairspray, and it&#x27;s all natural! Love it for my frizzy out of control hair!</li>
    <li> I love that this is safe to use (EWG) and that it&#x27;s lightweight on my hair - plus, it WORKS!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t offer as much hold as I expected, but was very good considering all natural ingredients, would certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. I&#x27;ve tried the super hold and found that it makes my hair crunchy but the regular hold is perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this to get away from all of the hairsprays with harsh chemicals, but I just didn&#x27;t love it, it didn&#x27;t hold very well and I felt like it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair (but I like a lot of product in my hair)</li>
    <li> This is the first cruelty free hairspray I have tried. I have always used \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; hairspray. I tried the Super Hold Aubrey Natural hairspray, and it was like hair glue. I decided to try the regular hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this hairspray smell SOOOO good. I feel like I have just left the salon. This hairspray is very light, especially, when comparing to the superhold. I had to spray a couple more times to get the hold that I want. I don&#x27;t mind that the regular hold is much more lighter than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a few days. I notice that when I used this hairspray, throughout the day, the skin where I part my hair would start to itch. My skin seemed to itch A LOT more than the \\&quot;superhold\\&quot; version, and it could be because with the superhold, I only had to use 1 pump, versus with the regular hold, I used 3-4 pumps. I skipped it one day and used another hairspray, and no itching. I tried it again, and my skin would itch again. It&#x27;s embarrassing when I could be having a conversation with my co-worker, and I would start scratching my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the superhold bottle to my co-worker who has very curly hair, and she uses it like hair gel, spraying it on her hand and then applying it onto her hair. When I mentioned the itching to my co-worker , and she commented that she did notice little bums around her hairline, but her skin isn&#x27;t itchy. I also gave this regular hold bottle to her daughter. I will see if she has either the itching or the bumps reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search for cruelty free hairspray continues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend pricing around for a lower price. I got mine at Vitacost, and they have the best prices on many products.</li>
    <li> I was wary of using any of the hair sprays on the market because of the many chemicals I would be breathing while spraying my hair with them.  I have used this product off and on for some twenty years or more.  I prefer the regular hold to the strong hold because it&#x27;s easier to comb it out when you are ready to do so.  I like the fragrance used, but I&#x27;m sure there are those that would feel it&#x27;s a bit strong and may clash with any perfume worn while using it.  I will never stop using this product, but an unscented version would be nice if I were to try to wear perfume as well.  It holds, but I am not that picky and my hair style does not require a stiff hair spray.  As always, everyone is different, if you have a hair style that just needs a little discipline, this product is great for that.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for healthiness, 2 stars for smell, 3 stars for effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this product because I am very health conscious and only use natural non-toxic personal care products that are as close to 100% organic as I can find.  This was the healthiest I could find in hairspray, but the odor is overpowering and lingers on the hair.  And it&#x27;s not very effective - although I haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; version of this product.  I have heavy Asian hair and in the past used products like Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine hairspray that would hold my hair even in humid conditions.  That was before I realized how important it was not to use toxic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I simply did not use hairspray to avoid toxins.  Since trying this Aubrey product I am back to not using hairspray on a regular basis.  My health is way too important to me.  I did recently purchase a small sample size of Giovanni LA Hold Hair Spritz but it still has 3 chemicals (less than most hairsprays) so will only use for special occasions when I&#x27;d really want it like an interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything you use on your skin, nails and scalp is absorbed into your bloodstream to at least some extent (not to mention your lungs depending on the product).  I hope that people will switch to organic products - or at least truly natural and non-toxic ones (natural is not necessarily non-toxic).  Even in health stores it&#x27;s hard to find products that are acceptable.  Don&#x27;t believe any labeling of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot;.  That simply means there is at least one natural or organic ingredient in there.  Do your research (see the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics at [...]) and READ LABELS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One benefit of this product is that it&#x27;s incredibly safe.  I accidentally sprayed it IN my eyes once and was shocked that it did not hurt.  I did not even have to rinse my eyes!</li>
    <li> None chemical , natural and great quality ! Aubrey never failed me !!! So I foreseeing a future purchases from Aubrey! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wonderful hold without making hair sticky or stiff.  Smells good--slightly spicy, but not in a manly way.  People ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing, that they like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing in terms of styling your hair. Only thing it&#x27;s good for is putting your hair down, but you can do that by washing your hair. Shouldn&#x27;t even be advertised as a hairspray.</li>
    <li> When I complained to my forum friends I didn&#x27;t like lining my lungs with the industrial strength hairspray I was using, one of them sent me a small bottle of this. It sat on the shelf for years until I retired and was no longer fixing my hair day after day. When I was headed out later, I grabbed it and spritzed my &#x27;do. It held it in place without gluing it. I still have some of the &amp;#34;touch my hair here and it will move there&amp;#34; spray but now it&#x27;s its turn to languish in the cabinet.</li>
    <li> Others have mentioned the fragrance, but I like it. Nice hold, and non-toxic! Rated very low on the EWG website.</li>
    <li> I love that there isnt a strong smell when you use this hairspray. I also like that it doesnt coat onto your hair. It doesnt seem to hold as good as some chemcially commercial ones, but I like that this product is better for your body. I have tried to switch all my products to ones that arent full of harsh chemicals. I dont use hairspray enough to make a difference in my daily life, but I do use it a few times a month and I think this is going to be a great product for that. I use it for flyaways when my hair is up in a bun. It does keep my hair in place, but I do notice that at the end of the day, I have more strands that have fallen. Its not a big deal thou, as most of my hair will stay in place. Its a good product. I would get it again, but this bottle will last me for years, at the rate that I use it!</li>
    <li> This herbal spray is just what I need: not too strong and not too light hold. Plus it&#x27;s natural .</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I found this hairspray. It&#x27;s not only non-toxic, it holds better than any of the awful toxic hairsprays I used to use. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pros: some hold, great smell (you can definitely smell the difference between this one and the chemical hairsprays)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t hold as well and weighs hair down a bit when you first spray it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use it at night to hold the curls and will try the extra hold version. Update: Extra holds MUCH MUCH better.</li>
    <li> natur al misst hairspray regular is a nice holding spray</li>
    <li> I like to THINK that it works, I does have an ok hold, not stiff, light if any smell (cant remember right now) but I use it a couple times a week... safe and I trust this brand... I a still looking for a better one so this will do until I find a replacement &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it is made of all natural ingredients.  The smell is great and its holding power is great.  I have coarse thick hair and it does a great job holding my hair in place.  I have recommended it to several friends and family.</li>
    <li> Not a strong hold at all, if that&#x27;s what you are after. It does tame fly-aways. Sadly it will deflate any body your hair has if spray more than a small amount. I feel like it just hangs on my hair? Probably because it&#x27;s a pump mist and not aerosol. I guess we all have to choose whether to save the environment or style our hair effectively.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells really good, but the scent is strong and lingers for a few hours. I feel like I have to use quite a bit of hairspray to get the effect I want (anti-frizz in a humid environment), but that may be because the bottle has a mister top instead of the continuous flow that most other (aerosol) hairsprays have. I think it has a good hold on my hair, and I will be using it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;-good hold&lt;br /&gt;-strong smell (I like it!)&lt;br /&gt;-feels like you&#x27;re using a lot (but you&#x27;re probably not)</li>
