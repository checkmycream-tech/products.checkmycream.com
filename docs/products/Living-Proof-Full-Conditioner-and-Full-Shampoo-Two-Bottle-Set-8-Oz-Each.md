<li> This is a clarifying shampoo, so it works VERY well for my scalp and hasn&#x27;t stopped working since I started using it at least a year ago.</li>
<li> It is long</li>
<li> I have tried several of the other types in this brand and find all of them to build up.</li>

<li> My friends with less hair and drier scalps don&#x27;t like this shampoo, calling it too harsh.</li>
<li> Seemed heavy and had a build up.  </li>
<li> The combination of the two products does tame the frizz.  </li>
<li> The softness, the fullness, and while it is expensive, it takes so little to lather up your hair and give these results  </li>
<li> Was not happy with the product even though it feels and smells divine.</li>
<li> works well for my thin hair</li>
<li> I agree it is expensive but it works.  </li>
<li> The fragrance is weird, I can&#x27;t put my finger on it</li>
<li> My wife likes these but man are they expensive</li>
<li> but it is to expensive to use all the time</li>
<li> My hair was falling out like crazy now</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like this shampoo and conditioner but it is to expensive to use all the time</li>
    <li> I really like the way this makes my hair feel. The fragrance is weird, I can&#x27;t put my finger on it but I know the smell. Works though so no big hurdle for me!</li>
    <li> Both are great products for fine hair!</li>
    <li> The combination of the two products does tame the frizz.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old and have been looking for something like this forever! Not only do I have fine hair I have fine thinning hair. My hair was falling out like crazy now I don&#x27;t lose as much hair. I have body it DOES NOT weight my hair down. I also use the 5 n 1 styling. I am not changing... So very happy.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  Arrives quickly. If you have fine hair this works great to give you extra body.</li>
    <li> This shampoos and conditioner is magnificent.  I chose it because I wanted shampoo without laureal sulfate. I was skeptical at first but my fine hair because my fine hair generally needs washed everyday or it appears oily.  Now, it is soft, shiny and can go without washing for 2 to 3 days.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a miracle product to make my baby fine, straight hair thicker.  I have tried everything out there. I came across this product line in an article on my home page entitled &amp;#34;How to make your fine hair look thicker&amp;#34; I was very hesitant to order because of the price. I did find a seller who gave me a good deal, so I said, OK, give it a shot!  I have to say that the bottles are a lot smaller than I anticipated, but they work. My hair feels like I have got so much more of it!  I would not use these every day, could be a little drying, but every other time will be fine. Also the cost is a factor for me. So far so good. I wish the bottles were bigger.</li>
    <li> I love the product and the Seller was awesome to work with.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and I love Living Proof, but I have since discovered I love the no frizz version better than Full. It just seems to make my fine hair more full than this one. But this is still a great product, and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> For the first few uses I thought this was GREAT.  However, after about a week I did not like the way my hair felt.  Seemed heavy and had a build up.  I do have well water so that may have been part of the problem but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> my hair felt dry and dirty waste of money high priced, want my money back, I would not ever purchase this shampoo or conditioner again</li>
    <li> Excellent product, full hair that stays all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. No alcohol in the ingredients, hair is fuller, softer and silkier feeling. This is the best product i have found that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry and provides fullness. It&#x27;s amazing,  i will Always use this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is superior to the many other shampoos and conditioners I have tried.  However, I did recently order the mousse because my hair dresser seems to think it is good.</li>
    <li> Fine hair. Agree is a great product however the no frizz version is better.</li>
    <li> Shampoo/conditioner was initially a Christmas gift for my daughter and she is very happy with it so have and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair and scalp is different so let me describe mine: my scalp is very oily (I have to wash my hair every day) and I color my hair once a month so it tends to be dry. It is long and I have a LOT of hair, but it is somewhat fine. It is wavy but I blow dry it straight. This is a clarifying shampoo, so it works VERY well for my scalp and hasn&#x27;t stopped working since I started using it at least a year ago. I don&#x27;t usually use the matching conditioner (or even the same brand- I have tried all different kinds of color safe specialty brands and I usually have to end up rotating) , but with this one I don&#x27;t feel like it builds up on my hair and it definitely gives me volume while helping to nourish my hair and keep it shiny. The lack of buildup probably because the shampoo is so clarifying. My friends with less hair and drier scalps don&#x27;t like this shampoo, calling it too harsh. I have tried several of the other types in this brand and find all of them to build up.</li>
    <li> wonderful shampoo and conditioner....love it. Only need to shampoo once. and use just a dab of the conditioner. helps your hair shine</li>
    <li> This is the ABSOLUTE BEST shampoo and conditioner, its rather expensive but if you can afford it buy it, it is perfect!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product and the pricing was much better than in a retail store.</li>
    <li> works well for my thin hair</li>
    <li> Too much moisturizer even when I used a dime size on my long hair.  Was not happy with the product even though it feels and smells divine.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner honestly is no better than anything I&#x27;ve used and for the money I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth it. I would use Biolage or something like that which is much cheaper.  Though it smells very nice!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. You only need to use a small amount to do the job. I never thought I&#x27;d pay this much for shampoo and conditioner but I am hooked. Perfectly smooth, bouncy, and full hair with no sulfates!</li>
    <li> Nice to get these via Prime! Saves me trips to the mall. This is a great shampoo free of sulfates and parabens.</li>
    <li> This product really delivers what is promised.  I have the thinnest, finest hair and using this shampoo and conditioner actually gives my hair some body.  I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> I agree it is expensive but it works.  I have fine, thin hair and I&#x27;m always looking for good products.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  It has a light fresh scent and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat or oily the next day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well at all - had to use another conditioner after using it.  Won&#x27;t finish bottle.  Cheaper one works better!</li>
    <li> I am stunned at this product&#x27;s results.  I went in to get my hair cut about a month ago and my stylist was going on and on about this line.  I tried it.  Wow.  The softness, the fullness, and while it is expensive, it takes so little to lather up your hair and give these results  I am finding a little goes a long long way. This reminds me of what you always dreamed a hair product could do for you. the fullness is amazing.  The curling cream is great too, when used, I don&#x27;t have to use hairspray anymore!  It just puts the curl in and keeps it all day.  I am thrilled with this and bought the curling cream and primer too.</li>
    <li> My wife likes these but man are they expensive</li>
    <li> Love this product;  my hair feels extremely clean. The most important factor to me is that the smell of the shampoo and conditioner is very pleasant. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Living Proof Conditioner and Shampoo is the BEST HAIR CARE PRODUCTS THAT YOU CAN BUY!! I have been using for a year now!! Love this product!!</li>
