      <li>Does not appear to be true BareMinerals.</li>
      <li>- it is so light with just the right coverage.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product at other locations and have always been happy with it.  </li>

      <li>I love the bare mineral products .  </li>

      <li>My face looks natural.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the bare mineral products .  Easy to apply, covers nicely and looks very natural.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use anything else but BareMinerals.  I have VERY sensitive skin, but this product does not irritate it and looks smooth all day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Bare Minerals make-up. It&#x27;s so light and I can sleep in it and not break out like I used to, years ago when I used other make-up. The matte foundation leaves my skin looking flawless!</li>
    <li> I will never buy my Bare Minerals from this seller. I do not believe this is the real stuff. The makeup is granular. I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for 3 years and have never seen any like this. I don&#x27;t get the coverage I&#x27;ve been getting. The low price should have been a clue. Beware!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product over and over again. It&#x27;s great light but full coverage dosen&#x27;t look caked on or fake.</li>
    <li> Love it and a great price!</li>
    <li> This is the same product and I don&#x27;t have to leave my office or home.&lt;br /&gt;I tell my girlfriends now!</li>
    <li> It is difficult to tap enough powder on the brush because the holes aren&#x27;t big enough to allow powder to surface when the jar is tapped on the bottom. The plastic cover with holes over the powder needs to be adjustable to make larger holes.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation!  It is light without that greasy/fill in the pores look!  Just great cover with&lt;br /&gt;a very natural look.</li>
    <li> Love the color and the way my skin looks with it on. I use it in the summer as my skin tends to sweat and it keeps me from looking shiny!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation! I have tried all others. Liquid, tints and other powders. Bare Minerals still is the best. I won&#x27;t use anything else. :)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, the product was as advertised, reasonably priced and arrived on time.  Would order again without hesitation as well as recommend to others.</li>
    <li> you cant go wrong with bare minerals I only use this makeup it goes on so pretty</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  It is my favorite makeup!!!!</li>
    <li> Once I started using this foundation I never went back to liquid - it is so light with just the right coverage.</li>
    <li> im not sure if its the same thing it really dont feel the same like bare minerals its ok i guesss</li>
    <li> Great product...use it all the time.</li>
    <li> But, there a better prices!!!!</li>
    <li> I Love the product it just took forever to receive it.</li>
    <li> Im very happy w my purchase,  product was exactly as described.  Im very happy.</li>
    <li> This product works very well to cover up while looking natural! plus the container is stylish and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Thi . Was not like my other shade..  Had sparkles in it. Way lighter than what it should be. I have been a bare minerals customer for 16 years.. Just highly disappointed :-(</li>
    <li> This is the same size container, the exact same product that I have been paying twice the amount for at the Bare Minerals Store................Sure glad I found this site......</li>
    <li> Love this product, loved the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for last 5 years. It is great make up and foundation and coverage. My face looks natural. You all know ladies on whose face you can see tons of powder or foundation. Bare Minerals are invisible. My face becomes all the same tone of color, under eyes, blemishes, redness, everything is covered up. It is also SPF 15, which is great. I am not one of the women who puts spf lotion on their face every morning. SPF lotions make my face shiny. So with Bare Minerals i protect my face from the sun and look good at the same time.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other make ups since I ran out of this but ultimately found no other like it.  It covers perfect and is light and airy.  I simply love BareMinerals.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for several years and have turned on so many people to this that I should be a representative. I live in the Caribbean and must purchase online. Since the bare minerals site does not ship to my mail forwarder P.O. address I was so happy to be able to order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Laura Mercier mineral powder for a few years.  Decided to try Bare Minerals as it is a bit cheaper and easier to find.  Great product.  Hides the redness on my face and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I like BareMinerals, specially powder foundation.  It is so easy to apply and my face looks smooth and fresh.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This foundation is not meant for your balls, it will cake up and be very uncomfortable.  If you are a pornstar like me you need to use a lighter ball foundation.</li>
    <li> I never used to know what kind of foundation to use but as soon as I tried the BareMinerals lineup...I will never use anything else. This foundation has a very, very slight shine to it which gives you a healthy glow - instead of a matte finish which can end up looking caked on. Pairing this foundation with their Prime Time primer, blush, bronzer and highlighter creates the perfect all-day look. As a side note, I would also invest in a makeup setting spray to make that perfect look last even longer!</li>
    <li> Product arrived but half of the powder was spilled out of container.  Does not appear to be true BareMinerals.</li>
    <li> Tried others but none can compare to the BareMinerals.  Covers the face and hides many spots, lines and unwanted blemishes.</li>
    <li> The wrong color came in the jar. The jar was labled correctly for the color I wanted but that was not the color that came. I  gave it to a friend and went somewhere else for the correct color.  The wrong color made me look very pale and sickly.</li>
    <li> This product is clearly fake - i compared it to an original bought from Ulta and the labels, print and the whole package is clearly a knock-off.....</li>
    <li> Love this bare mineral products.&lt;br /&gt;The skin looks really natural, your skin never looks shinny.</li>
    <li> Is this a new formulation for Bare Minerals? I&#x27;ve been wearing this color for years and this particular one is very shiny on my face. The color is good, but the shine is awful. I&#x27;m having to use other products just to tone it down..</li>
    <li> Product itself was okay. Bottle was a little smaller than expected. next time i will be sure to check exact size of product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, still my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have horrible skin allergies and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found in a long time that does not break me out. On top of that the coverage is great and nothing about this feels &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this item in July. When I went to use this product it was obvious not original.  Does not mix with water, cakey, and the color was off. Will not buy from this person again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed....I ordered medium beige but it is too light for my skin tone...using it for adding highlights.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Bareminerals foundation line.  My face has not had a breakout in ages.  I was super excited that I got my make up in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Has a bad smell.  Not the original product.  The original is fragrance free.  The texture is different.  The color is different.  The jar is different.  I have used bm for years straight from the company Bare Minerals.  This product is not the same.</li>
    <li> I GOT RIPPED OFF!!! I GOT SENT SOME COMPUTER PART INSTEAD OF THE MAKE UP. NEEDLESS TO SAY MY WIFE WAS UNHAPPY FOR CHRISTMAS WHEN SHE OPENED THIS.</li>
    <li> Very happy with seller great price, perfect size for travel. Great price for the money . It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. How can you sell something that is not Bare Minerals? I have used bare minerals for years. I used my mother&#x27;s day gift card for your fake product!</li>
    <li> Love this product, always order the same color.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Bare Minerals and can&#x27;t get enough of them. This was a really good deal for a full size product.</li>
    <li> This is lighter than my last medium beige BareMinerals foundation that i had.  I purchased that product at a BareMinerals store.&lt;br /&gt;This product works but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same stuff. It has a fragrance to it which my last product didn&#x27;t have. I&#x27;ll use it but will probably just go back to the B/M store and pay a little more.</li>
    <li> makeup was much lighter than the original spf15 foundation-medium beige 8g.  Caked  alot also. i started off liking bm with my 1st purchase in store. Not anymore wiith this recent order from you.</li>
    <li> I have tried many types and brands of foundation over the years.  I like this one the best by far.  It leaves a natural looking face, yet has a very finished look.  The minerals are much better for my skin and easy to use.  I would recomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product at other locations and have always been happy with it.  I finally received my product (which took a LONG time) and I am not happy with it. It does not seem to be the same product as what I have purchased previously.  It is not lasting throughout the day.  I am unhappy with this product individually and the shipping time for everything else I have ever ordered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love BareMinerals and think this is a wonderful product because it covers up without feeling gunky on your face.</li>
    <li> This makeup is a knock-off of a namebrand cosmetic. They have made a fake container that looks very similar to the brand, fake labeling (you can see mistakes in the printing on the packaging), they applied a fake sticker to the packaging indicating it was Medium Beige when the underlying packaging says Fairly Medium. The product consistency is not the same as the name brand. Totally ripped off.</li>
    <li> been using this stuff for about 10-years.  I also mix it in with my moisturizer to make a liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Bare Minerals is Cruelty Free, but please note, their parent company is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a concern for me since I found out, I may have to seek another brand. Eminence makes one as well, but I don&#x27;t liek the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. My skin was awful from all the oil in other products with full coverage. Can be a bit messing, wear a bib, lol! Love this though!</li>
    <li> The product is good. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I always love Bare Minerals,very natural</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived very fast! Love it</li>
    <li> This product does not seem to have the quality like when you purchases it directly from BareMinerals.  Even though it was the same color it appears to be darker and doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have never been happier with a make-up and I have have tried several different kinds. I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> L o v e  b a r e  m i n e r a l s! It is the best foundation ever!</li>
    <li> I love BareMinerals! I do think they are expensive so was very happy with the price and promtness of  my order. I do wish they had it in more colors.Other than that, I am very pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> I just finished the one I got from the store so when I open this item from amazon  and use it...oh my gosh...its a fake or expired! No wonder it was so cheap.</li>
    <li> I have been using this makeup for years and it is very easy on my skin.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a natural makeup product.</li>
