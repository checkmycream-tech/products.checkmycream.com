      <li>I heats up quickly and does a great job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for quick touch-ups.</li>

      <li>so the compact size was great, it even came in a little case which was handy.  </li>
      <li>However, I decided to keep this because it was really cheap and it works.</li>
      <li>I primarily use this for touch-ups vs. straightening all of my hair.</li>
      <li>Bought a different one in Italy for 20 Euros that worked great.</li>
      <li>But the \\&quot;red\\&quot; light that indicates whether it&#x27;s on or not has stopped working...</li>

      <li>and it worked perfectly the entire time without doing much damage to my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> it is great for travel to straiten your bangs but to do more than that I would bring my regular flat iron. The size is great but if you could control the temp it would be an amazing product and I am sure you could do more with it then</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have the big salon version at home and was getting ready to take a European vacation. I was told that even though you have the correct adapters sometimes your products don&#x27;t work the same once you&#x27;re home. I decided to purchase this travel size thinking it woul be similar to my wonderful product at home. WRONG! This mini travel size fails in straightening hair. It doesn&#x27;t get hot at all. I have semi wavy hair and the big croc can straighten it with no problems but this small one does absolutely nothing! I was very disappointed and wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Hey everyone! I am a guy with medium long thick straight hair. Sorta like an emo/scene style and this product is great. My goal was to flat iron my hair so I could give it a more beachy look with different flips and curls. It looks way better. This mini flat iron is the perfect size and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. It heats up pretty fast but its not the fastest. If you want a 30 second heat up, this mini is not for you. It takes like 1 minute to heat up. My brother has pretty curly hair and he has a mini flat iron like me, but not the same one. He has the Jose Eber petite flat iron which is even smaller than mine and heats up in 30 seconds. I highly recommend that one too. The croc however, I think, is better for thicker hair because it has a slightly bigger plate. You can grab a little more hair and if you run through your hair slowly it flattens it out and makes it really straight. Also, I like that this flat iron has spring plates which means it doesnt completely crush your hair. It adjusts to your hair. This is supposed to be healthier for your hair. One way to check if it has spring plates (I don&#x27;t know what the plates are really called) is if you press down on the plates and it moves up into the iron. Remember to buy a thermal heat protector if you blow dry and flat iron your hair daily. Thats what i do with this iron and it makes my hair shinier than when i use the flat iron alone. It also protects your hair from heat damage and makes it look and feel healthier. If you have longer hair you shouldn&#x27;t go for the mini flat irons.</li>
    <li> This travel iron doesn&#x27;t get very hot and it takes forever to go through my hair.  I&#x27;d much rather travel with one twice the size and spend 1/4 of the time on my hair. Who has 30 minutes to straighten hair when traveling? I do throw this in my gym bag from time to time in case I want to straighten my bangs, but forget it for overall use.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel straightening iron!  While it wouldn&#x27;t work well for \\&quot;large jobs\\&quot;, it works for travel (especially overseas...I bought it specifically for it&#x27;s dual voltage) and gets hot fast!  And the price is right too!  Had I known this a while ago, I could have saved some bad hair days while on overseas vacations and thus had better vacation photos.  When I return to the states, I plan on keeping this in my gym bag, and it&#x27;s also small enough for a purse too.  Small, lightweight with heat proof bag included.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t expect too much from a flat iron that&#x27;s the size of your hand... but it worked well enough.  I was short on packing room so the compact size was great, it even came in a little case which was handy.  I have rather short hair and it did what I needed it to do, but I&#x27;m sure you out there that are blessed with long thick locks may want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;m impressed with the shipping and speed of the seller. With that being said, the MIni Croc comes in a mesh-plastic zip up pouch. Inside of that is a leather heat-resistant case that has a magnetic clasp that keeps it closed. The iron itself heats up very quickly. I&#x27;m a hairstylist and this iron works well on all hair types. There is no temp setting for the mini only the full size versions. I was using a GHD mini and full size and have sold them to upgrade to the Croc mini and full size.</li>
    <li> I bought this for our trip to Ireland, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a voltage converter for my flat iron. I was hoping the higher heat temperature would make up for the \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size.....it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was straight for about the first 20 minutes, but after that it got messy and wavy again. The price was cheaper than a voltage converter, but unfortunately it couldn&#x27;t tame my wild hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron thinking it was bigger and I had a surprised when it arrived. However, I decided to keep this because it was really cheap and it works. I just didn&#x27;t find that it gets too hot. It&#x27;s good for traveling.</li>
    <li> Tiny size makes it easy to bring along anywhere.  Also, the size helps reach the hair nearest your scalp.  This is definitely a plus.  It does not get as hot as some other flat irons. Not a plus. But it gets hot enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> This little flat iron is great! It heats up fast and really hot! Works as well as my HAI but of course too small to do all my hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull at my hair which is great. The plates are great, hair just glides through. It is perfect for what I had in mind, touch ups and my bangs. Love it! Glad I got it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron for a trip to Europe since it works with their electrical system. The iron was great! It heats up really fast, and it actually works very well on my hair. I have a lot of hair so it takes a while to get it done with the size of this little iron, but, the fact that is so tiny and that can fit anywhere in your suitcase is worth the extra 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The travel pouch it comes with is awesome, &#x27;cause you can put the iron away while is still hot, so you can just do your hair then pack the thing up and go to the airport :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for my upcoming trip to europe but also because the ceramic in my old one actually burnt out and was damaging my hair every time I used it. I plan to get the actual 1.5\\&quot; Croc iron because my hairdresser uses it on my hair and it works really well. The mini actually works pretty well also and for me it gets more than hot enough in only a couple minutes. I found that I only needed to run the iron through my hair once for it to get straight. The finish isn&#x27;t exactly as smooth as the regular 1.5\\&quot; Croc iron but it&#x27;s pretty close. I have long coarse hair and I was concerned about the size but I was able to get my whole head done in about 30 mins. In general, the iron feels sturdy and durable and the swivel cord means it wont snap with continued use. I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
    <li> this is a great straightener for traveling. I like the way it is in a little traveling pouch and it works great. It changes Volt by its self. Great little product and my daughters like it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, light weight, adaptable to 100-240V.  Worked great on my hair and heated to the perfect temperature for quick use.  This will be my only travel styling product from here on out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for vacation, but still use it daily. I wanted something little I could throw in my carry-on, and this definitely fit the bill. The price is pretty unbeatable here on Amazon. It heats up quickly and works very well considering it&#x27;s size. I have really thick, medium-length hair, and am able to straighten it all in about 10 minutes. The one thing I&#x27;m not a fan of is the on/off slide switch on the inside of the iron. I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;ll burn fingers sticking them in there. I usually just unplug and wait a minute or two before flipping the switch. It&#x27;d also be nice if it got a tad bit hotter. I still love it and it&#x27;s replaced my old Conair straightener.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I can return this but I should have known from the price that it was too good to be true.  The iron doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair at all.  It doesn&#x27;t heat up very well.  I took it on a recent trip and wound up going to Walmart and purchasing a lesser brand for less than the cost I paid on Amazon but the iron did the job.  I&#x27;m not sure if this iron was used or refurbished but it definitely did not live up to the reviews I&#x27;d seen on it.  Would love to return!!  I&#x27;d give it less than a 1 star if I could.</li>
    <li> this flat iron is the perfect size for travel and works well for styling your hair.  THe heat mat is an added bonus while styling as well as bing able to pack up right away after using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to have a small flat iron for travelling internationally.  It is well designed and all that is needed is a plug adapter to use in the country you visit.  It is currently working great in Italy!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful travel iron that can adapt to the voltage whereever you travel. all you have to do is chanage the voltage on the travel iron</li>
    <li> Hot little thing great for ends, roots and touch ups....Just needs about 2,3mins or so to get hot.</li>
    <li> gets really hot to hold on the handle part. the product just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I needed a flat iron that was dual voltage that didn&#x27;t take up too much room in my luggage &amp; didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  While this doesn&#x27;t heat up as fast or as much as my CHI, it worked on my week long trip to Spain like a champ.  Only had to buy a plug converter that worked with all of my other dual voltage apliances.  Yeah!</li>
    <li> This is small and very slim - exactly what I wanted for travel (or for your handbag).  It&#x27;s perfect for touching up and for travelling.  I love that it&#x27;s dual voltage so it works in Europe and the US.  It gets very hot when heated - some reviewers don&#x27;t agree with this but I can&#x27;t understand that.  Overall I would highly recommend it for travel and touch ups - not for daily use straighening long thick hair.</li>
    <li> The size is great for travel, and it works well with all European outlets - never had an electrical problem unlike people I traveled with that brought regular appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT.. as other reviews have stated, the iron really doesn&#x27;t get that hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think this would be an issue because I have VERY thin hair, but the combination of low heat and small size ended up being an annoyance that I didn&#x27;t want to afford while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item itself did not feel cheaply made, was easy to handle, and came with a convenient heat protection pouch. But, I wish I would have gone with a different product.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is just what I was looking for.  It does a great job straightening my hair and the size is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works incredibly well and is small enough for travel and being on the go.  I bought it for my trip to Paris and used it with an adapter.  It heats up really fast.  It felt a little too hot with French electricity, but nothing dangerous.  I have been using it for a few months now because I have short hair and it I don&#x27;t need to use my larger flat iron.  This is one of my favorite purchases.</li>
    <li> I lived in France for the summer and needed a straightener just for my bangs. I was initially hesitant to buy this product due to some bad reviews, but it turned out to work perfectly! I heats up quickly and does a great job. All you will need is a plug adaptor and you&#x27;re ready to head overseas! I now use it back in the U.S. b/c it&#x27;s so quick, small, and convenient. It also makes really nice curls, but if you&#x27;re looking to straighten all of your hair I would opt for a larger straightener.</li>
    <li> I have a short hair cut and my stylist uses this iron on my hair. I asked her about it and she said... I can get you one for $40... ummm no... I paid half the price here for it!! It&#x27;s the perfect size for my hair and easy to hold on to. But the \\&quot;red\\&quot; light that indicates whether it&#x27;s on or not has stopped working... I hope this is not a sign the entire iron will fizz out soon!!! Of course I tossed the shipping container so I can&#x27;t return it!! I would recommend this if you have short hair.</li>
    <li> It works great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there&#x27;s no temperature gauge on it. So there&#x27;s just &amp;#34;on and hot&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way to control the temp</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! it is perfect for travel...the dual voltage worked well for my trip to Italy and Spain. I primarily use this for touch-ups vs. straightening all of my hair. It works perfectly for touching up bangs. I am actually adding another one to my Christmas list this year so I can have two and keep one in my travel bag and one to use for quick touch-ups all the time. This iron is suprisingly thin and small, and heats up very fast. I also love that it comes in a nice pouch.</li>
    <li> Great little flat iron.  Bought it for vacation and it packs well in your luggage.  Gets hot fast and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for traveling and works pretty well for it&#x27;s size.  My husband and I went to Italy and wanted to carry on all of our luggage, so I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t take up space.  The case doubles as a heat protective mat, so not only could you set it down on anything, but you could wrap it up and pack it while it was still hot.  It heats up fast and the dual voltage is perfect for traveling anywhere.  It takes a little longer to straighten my hair than with my regular sized one, but was perfect for the trip.</li>
    <li> This works okay. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot, but works okay for the price. I was looking for a smaller straightener and this was one of the few I was able to find.</li>
    <li> I agree with some of the other reviews.  It doesn&#x27;t get very hot and I had a hard time straightening my thick asian hair with it.  However, it&#x27;s very portable and the price is great, so I won&#x27;t feel so bad if it breaks during travel.</li>
    <li> I just returned from vacation in Europe and was extremely pleased with this product.  It heated up very quickly and did a great job on my hair.  My hair is fairly thick and shoulder length, but the smaller size was not an issue.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the flat iron does not heat up to the level of the basic Croc irons.  It did not straighten my hair.  Loved the travel size, but needs more heat!!!</li>
    <li> I should have known from some of the low rating reviewers that this was going to be underpowered and unable to reach heat levels needed for my hair. I should have listened to the my inner cynic. But I desperately wanted to believe the happy high raters since I was heading out of the country with light baggage and badly wanted a small item like this. Fortunately, I tested it out before I left. It cannot do what I need it to do for my hair. Yes, it heats up. Probably gets hot enough to burn you hand. It will not work on thicker hair. I don&#x27;t have long hair. My hair reaches my ear lobes.But the plate and the temperature on this appliance are insufficient for me. I left it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably be dropping this off at Goodwill and reminding myself to listen to the little voice in my head when it cautions me.</li>
    <li> I used this flat iron on an overseas visit to Australia. It took up very little space &amp; is lightweight. There is no temperature control or switch for 110 to 220 volts. It did a fine job of straightening my hair. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> For the price, this flat iron is great. The size is perfect for travel and it fits neatly back into the carrying case (which doubles as a heat-protector pad). I brought it to Europe and attached a small adapter - no converter needed. Obviously not a $200 flat iron, but it gets quite hot and straightens my hair very well.</li>
    <li> The Baby Croc Hair Straightener is very compact and does a pretty nice job straightening hair.  Doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot as the regular flat iron but it gets hot enough.  Great for a 2nd flat iron especially if you don&#x27;t want to pay the&lt;br /&gt;Price for the full size.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Did not work in Italy.  Bought a different one in Italy for 20 Euros that worked great.</li>
    <li> Compact and doesn&#x27;t look to girly!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was doing more traveling and my regular one is so big to pack.  This is quite small, it is cute.  I was initially concerned that it would be too small to actually work.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It works extremely well.  Is a little narrower so a few more swipes are necessary.  However, I found it easier to handle than my large one.  The cord has a swivel on it, so that also makes it easier to use.  I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I used this for over 4 months in Europe and the UK and it worked perfectly the entire time without doing much damage to my hair. It is very small though so if you need to straighten you entire head or if you have curly hair instead of wavy, I would not recommend it for you. Heats up quickly (only has an on/off button so you can&#x27;t choose the temperature) and has a heat protecting pad so when you use it and then need to pack it right away it&#x27;s really nice! No problems at all.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! I love it. It heats up very quick and is very efficient. I love it doesn&#x27;t take up room.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for on the go and doesn&#x27;t tear or burn my hair but it definitely takes a while unless your hair is already pretty darn close to being straight.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron for short hair, really gets hot!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers, this really doesn&#x27;t heat up enough for straightening thick hair. But, it works great on long beards!</li>
    <li> Took it to Europe on vacation worked very well...a little small but I was very happy.. It worked well</li>
    <li> A little too narrow to be very useful.</li>
    <li> I needed a flat iron to take to the UK, so it needed to be dual voltage, and small, and I only needed it for my bangs, so this one was absolutely perfect.  It seems well made and the little case is a nice touch.  I don&#x27;t see a problem with any slowness heating up, as others have mentioned.  I just turn it on to let it warm up while I do other things like make-up, brushing teeth, then it&#x27;s very hot and ready to use.  It is really small though, so for more than just bangs, it might be frustrating.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely short and straight. I had purchased a small curling iron but it was difficult to get the hair around it without burning myself. This small iron does exactly what I need and my short do looks great!</li>
    <li> great for travel.  Comes in case and a heat resistant hot pad.</li>
    <li> Is it great for travel? Yeah, sure. But as a flat iron it really leaves something to be desired.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. Small, portable, powerful, you should probably buy it.</li>
    <li> So far, after 3 weeks in Italy, this flat iron has been absolutely perfect.  My hair is more or less straight after blow drying, so I mainly use a flat iron to smooth and polish my hairstyle.  I was wary of how tiny, only 5/8 inch!, this is, as I use a 2in flat iron at home.  But I have not had any problems achieving the exact same look in almost the same amount of time.  It packs up perfectly for travel and works great in different countries without any hassle of hauling around a converter.  Just remember your adapter!</li>
    <li> Loved this super slim, light weight flat iron.  I purchased it in preps for a trip to Great Britain.  It was a space saver that paid off!  For such a small iron it heats quickly and does a remarkable job.  Impressive given its size.  So, don&#x27;t let it&#x27;s petit appearance scare you!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this particular flat iron. That being said, I am NOT affiliated with any sort of professional hair service providers. I also own a 1\\&quot; HSI flat iron, and, while it is noticeably larger, making it less suitable for travel, my opinion is that it is worth the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Flat iron heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;Convenient size&lt;br /&gt;Simple interface&lt;br /&gt;Cushioned plates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Cheap\\&quot; appearance&lt;br /&gt;Plastic shell&lt;br /&gt;No temperature setting&lt;br /&gt;Low maximum temperature (ESTIMATED at approximately 300-320 degrees Fahrenheit, although I did not perform any actual test on this. Flat irons typically work best (for me) between 370 and 380 degrees Fahrenheit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I did not find this product to be useful in performing the only task I purchased it to do. Additionally, I am a male with hair relatively shorter than most women, therefore I assume straightening hair with this iron would take significantly longer with longer hair (Past neck/shoulder). The only possible use I can imagine for this flat iron are styling and detailing, although even this could be difficult with a relatively cool iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the narrower iron surface is NOT a vital detail, I would highly recommend the HSI flat iron line for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If the narrow iron IS the key aspect you seek, I recommend BabyBliss mini flat irons. I do not own one, but have used one in a salon environment and was satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great little iron!  Heats up great...  and is perfect for our motorcycle trips!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to anyone!  Great product</li>
    <li> Cheap and small so good for travelling. But I&#x27;m not sure whats dual voltage about it. Used it in Egypt for a few months and it burnt out. Also very limited power due to size. Good for one trip but wont last you much longer than that.</li>
    <li> This lightweight but powerful flat iron will be a pleasure with to travel in Europe. Will use the hotel hairdryer and finish styling with this Baby Croc. All I need is the country adapter. Tested it at home, and even though it is small compared to my big brand name flat iron, it worked just as well. My last trip overseas, I had to go in search of a country specific flat iron, because I was not aware that the hotel hairdryer power could not get my hair as dried and styled as we are used to in USA. Now I am ready to travel anywhere!</li>
    <li> Bought this to take with me on frequent trips abroad because I liked that it had the dual voltage. However, the plug is so oversized that it won&#x27;t fit into a standard adapter. That is, the American plug on this thing won&#x27;t fit into the American socket of my adapter that would make it work in European sockets -- and this is true of three different types of adapters I tried. What a waste! I do like that it comes in its own case with a heat pad, but it&#x27;s not that much smaller than my normal straightening iron so I just use my full-size iron when I travel in the US because it does the job so much faster than this tiny one.</li>
    <li> I liked that it was compact and easy to travel with, but that is about all.&lt;br /&gt;It has no dial for temperature (just an on/off switch) and it does not get very hot at all. I have thin hair that it usually very easy to straighten and this small straightener does not straighten my hair at all. .</li>
    <li> Really too small, even for very short hair!</li>
    <li> I buy to my wife, she uses in all trips. The small size is perfect to use in a trip.</li>
    <li> I took this on a trip to Berlin.  It worked flawlessly, and was very easy to store since it&#x27;s quite small.  I was a little worried about how effective it would be when I saw just how small, but it worked great.  I&#x27;m glad to have it for my travels as it is very convenient to bring along. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Small. Doesn&#x27;t get really hot. I already have straight hair, so it works for me. If you have have long wavy or curly hair, I would recommend a full size one. Quality is good. I like it. Good travel item.</li>
    <li> I have used this in several countries and had no problems. It works well and travels well as it&#x27;s light and well built.</li>
    <li> This thing is so travel friendly and comes in the cutest heat pad. I keep it at work for bad hair days or rainy days and it gets hott and straightens my hair fast and easy. I would recommend to anyone looking for a smaller compact flat iron that can fit in your purse.</li>
    <li> I bought this little unit specifically for travel, as one would expect.&lt;br /&gt;It exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I used it every day of my recent 2 week vacation. It heats up quickly to 300+ and does the job, straightening about an inch-wide swath at a time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really lightweight, and because it comes with its own little roll-up, magnetized-closure travel case, complete with elastic bands to keep the iron and cord in place, it&#x27;s super easy to throw into your purse or carry-on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the seller means by dual voltage. It has a regular American plug, so if you want to use it overseas, you&#x27;ll need to bring along an adapter. There&#x27;s no switch on it that regulates its power output.&lt;br /&gt;Since it has just 2 settings, on &amp; off, if you are obsessed with dialing around for some kind of optimum temperature, that&#x27;s not going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally wavy, but not curly, and it is not thick.  I wear it in a chin-length bob.  If you have thick or long hair, or usually straighten thick sections of hair with each swipe, I imagine styling will take longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next trip will be overseas.  Should I run into any complications, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2013 Success in South Korea!  I used it with my heavy adapter that has a switch choice of 1600W or 50W. I set it to 50 (1600W is for hairdryers). It works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;I might have been able to use the small, simple plug adapter, but this is my HAIR, and attending a family wedding with a huge singed patch on my head didn&#x27;t seem like a smart idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> this flat is good for me because i have short hair.it gets very hot so be careful,also the price was good.</li>
    <li> The size is nice and I love the case. It&#x27;s temperature is good and it slides nicely on my hair. Would be nice to get the colored one, but they charge MORE for the cute colors :(</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to flattened even one strand of hair.  I was very disappointed as I have purchased 2 full size Croc flatirons and they are amazing.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Doesn&#x27;t warn up!</li>
    <li> Good product. Great for travel. It&#x27;s going to take a bit longer to straighten a lot of hair because of it&#x27;s size but it works!</li>
    <li> I bought this based off of Amazon and other travel website reviews. The price is decent. However, when I tried it out, I was quickly dissappointed. The heat is low, and even my fine wavy hair would not be straightened. The worst part was that it smelled like burning plastic whenever I turned it on. After using it on a trip through Europe for 3 weeks, I tossed it. If you really want straight hair, bring a regular flat iron.</li>
    <li> This flat iron did a great job and quickly straightened my hair.  It didn&#x27;t take long to heat up and having the heat pad really helped.</li>
    <li> I used this in England, Italy and Ireland with no issues. The iron is quite small, but it most certainly served its purpose. I just allowed a few extra minutes to get my hair done each morning. It heats up quickly, and the protective mat was a really nice bonus--since using the iron was normally the last thing I did before packing up and moving on. The only drawbacks were, as others have stated--size is small, so you have to spend a bit more time working on your styling. (But this is also a big plus for packing--it takes up only a tiny amount of space in your suitcase!) The other is that there are no heat controls, but it gets really hot, so that&#x27;s not such a big deal. It worked great wherever we went! (Just make sure you have the correct plug adapters along with you!!)</li>
    <li> And, very convenient for using at home, because it&#x27;s so light and small - it&#x27;s especially easy to use on very short hair.  I left one in a hotel room, and ordered another one, because I missed it so much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for when I was living in Europe last year for the summer. Every pound counted as far as luggage was concerned and I refused to be in Europe without a flat iron. This one is light weight, fits easily into European adaptors and gets hot enough to flat iron your hair. My hair is medium thickness so for those with thicker hair it may take longer, but I used this item everyday for 3 months straight and it never failed me. Definitely recommend for traveling.</li>
    <li> Go hot quickly. But my hair is longer so was not as effective...but very portable and worked well with European electricity.</li>
    <li> awesome, quick shipper, and comes in a really nice small zip up bag. i would reccommend it to anyone for a nice gift</li>
    <li> The only thing was... I sent in the warrantee on the product and It&lt;br /&gt; was returned to me in the mail. Correct address, yes ... huh?</li>
    <li> Great as far as traveling because they are small and compact. Not so good if you have a lot of hair to flat iron.</li>
    <li> I am a professional hairstylist and I love this product.  It is handy for smoothing short hair as well as bangs.  It is easy to handle and use and I would recommend it to non-professionals who sometimes have a difficult time with flat irons.  It&#x27;s great for quick touch-ups.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot and it turns off after a certain amount of time, which stinks because I have a lot of hair so it takes some time to straighten it!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my trip to Europe. It works great and heat really fast. Some previous reviews complained that it doesn&#x27;t get really hot, but for me it&#x27;s hot enough. I usually set at 350 F in my regular flat iron, and for this one I feel it&#x27;s similarly hot when it heats up. You can&#x27;t adjust temperature setting with this flat iron, but for a small and convenient flat iron for travelling, I think it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> This little thing worked great in Europe.  It&#x27;s small, so perfect for traveling.  I&#x27;ll keep using it when I travel!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d probably want something a little bigger for everyday use, but this little guy is great for traveling. Comes in a nice little case, works well and isn&#x27;t very expensive. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The plates are very small and do not heat up like a full size Croc.  Hair product also sticks very easily to the plates requiring clean up constantly.</li>
    <li> A typical travel iron, does the job while on the run but cannot replace a full size flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling .  It heat&#x27;s up very nicely</li>
    <li> -The heat wrap is nice, allows you to throw it in a bag as soon as you&#x27;re done without waiting for it to cool.&lt;br /&gt;-Because it is small, real estate is limited as far as the handle goes. Just have to be careful not to grab it too high on the iron&lt;br /&gt;-Gets hot very quickly</li>
    <li> Love this Lil flat iron ðŸ˜€</li>
    <li> This is way too small!! I bought it for an upcoming trip to Europe and thought the travel size would be perfect, but it only fits a few stands of hair at a time so it takes FOREVER to do anything. Plus, it gets hot but doesn&#x27;t really straighten. I went over and over a wavy pice of hair and all it did was fry my hair without straightening it. I&#x27;ll be sending it back and getting something else for my trip.</li>
    <li> Managed to operate and work well through several trips abroad. That&#x27;s good for me!!!</li>
    <li> Traveled for two week and it was a little more trouble than a regular size straightener, but I managed. You need a transformer and plug extender in Spain. I liked having the padded carrier as I some times had to pack it warm. It did the job.</li>
