      <li>of course the argan oil is the real gem in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I really recommend it.</li>
      <li>applied the body butter all over; it&#x27;s such a full body type of cream.</li>

      <li>Don&#x27;t even feel the need to order the other brand now, found a very luxurious butter in this brand with out the sky high price!!!  </li>
      <li>The 100% pure argan oil is shipped directly from Morocco and immediately stored in a climate controlled warehouse to keep the highest potency possible.</li>
      <li>There were floral hints, but still soft.</li>
      <li>Make your skin so amazingly SOFT.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this for my wife.  Now I use it after I shave and now I&#x27;m keeping it for myself.</li>
    <li> Im super super excited to try this  product! And i tried and its super good and soft to skin. Ive been using it everyday now and i love it. Its not greasy. Its wasy to apply.</li>
    <li> This is the second product I&#x27;m trying from LT Organics and so far I&#x27;m impressed with their products. The Whipped Argon body butter smells wonderful and left my skin feeling baby soft and silky,  a big plus it&#x27;s all natural,  none of the parabens or other harmful additives in it</li>
    <li> Hate this product.  Smells bad, like stale beer.  Reviews are so misleading.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money.  Buy Josie Maran&#x27;s whipped argan oil instead.</li>
    <li> I love it thank u so much</li>
    <li> This butter is whipped, very luxurious feel to it. The ingredient list is full of organic oils. The cocoa butter is evident.  It&#x27;s in a pretty, shiny brown jar, to help preserve the product.</li>
    <li> Good price, time I like the fact that it was delivered ahead of the estimated delivery time. The scent is a light combination of citrus and nuts like macadamia and no chemicals. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells good. I use this for my body ever night.</li>
    <li> Very nice overall moisturizer.  I use it on my face, necks, elbows and legs. Absorbs quickly ... hydrates well..</li>
    <li> This body lotion is really good, I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> As with all of LT Organics&#x27; skincare, the Argan Oil Whipped Body Butter is paraben free, sulfate free, and cruelty free. The 100% pure argan oil is shipped directly from Morocco and immediately stored in a climate controlled warehouse to keep the highest potency possible. With ingredients such as sunflower oil, aloe, flax seed oil, beeswax, and rosehip oil, it&#x27;s no wonder this boy butter is a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course the argan oil is the real gem in the ingredients. The blended oil will help reduce fine lines and wrinkles, improve skin elasticity, and restore a healthy glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Ultra-hydrating whipped body butter is so smooth and creamy it&#x27;s almost yummy! It was moisturizing against my skin and I could feel the deep penetration, without any sticky or heavy residue. It&#x27;s not greasy, but it lasts throughout the day, withstanding the humidity and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the body butter all over; it&#x27;s such a full body type of cream. Even with damp skin from a shower, it applied smoothly to my skin. The consistency of the body butter allows a little to go a long way! I didn&#x27;t need to use much to cover each area of my body. Just taking a small scoop on my finger and massaging it into my skin was enough to feel fully hydrated. I always appreciate when I don&#x27;t need to use tons of a product to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was also lovely! Potent without being overpowering; elegant without being matronly. There were floral hints, but still soft. I really liked the scent, and found that it paired well with the other scents that I use in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, LT Organics crafted a full bodied, creamy, delectable Whipped Argan Oil Body Butter. The texture is soft and creamy, the scent is amazing, and it moisturizes the entire body. It&#x27;ll pair well in any skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I received this product free from the company in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> I have used the body butter only once so far, but I do like it.  I will write a review at a later date when I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to use it.</li>
    <li> Received this recently and could not wait to try it.....Well I have to say it is one of the best body butters that I have ever used.... Make your skin so amazingly SOFT.  Smells nice also, not real perfumey just of soft bouquet of really wonderful smelling flowers.  Not overwhelming, extremely pleasant.  Won&#x27;t compete with your regular perfume.  I really can&#x27;t get over how soft and hydrated my skin was just after one use!!!!!  This stuff is pretty amazing...  Wanted to try another very pricy butter made with argan oil that is sold at another shopping network - just on a whim I saw this and ordered , great price, and amazing quality.....Don&#x27;t even feel the need to order the other brand now, found a very luxurious butter in this brand with out the sky high price!!!  Really could not be any happier with this product,  If you are looking at this brand - with all of its attributes - My thoughts are order it - you won&#x27;t regret it - This stuff is really NICE - my husband commented the very first time I used this on the great smell and how amazingly soft my skin was!!!!!  That&#x27;s all the convincing that I needed - and even after my 10 hour shifts at work - my skin feels like I just put this moisturizer on......And this will last you a long time I used one dollop and it did my whole leg and my hands...so I really did not even put a dent in the jar and I used this all over.  Just really really gooooood stuff!!!!!!!  mo911</li>

    <li> Very good argan oil whipped body body. Scent is very light , goes on smooth, and leaves skin very well nourished.Very pleased with product. A little goes a long way.Will purchase again.</li>

    <li> This body butter is superb.  Wonderful smell, absorbs quickly, Doesn&#x27;t take much and my skin looks and feels fantastic!</li>
    <li> I think that this product is really awesome, it smells really nice and is really moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing I think could be improved is the ingredient list. As a vegan when I see anything with more than 10 ingredients I get a little nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product :)</li>
