      <li>I noticed how nice my fingers felt after applying it to my face</li>
      <li>It does have a kind of medicinal fragrance which is a bit off-putting.</li>
      <li>This is a good thing because I would not be able to even try out this product if its scent was overpowering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a moisturizer, this did a nice job.  </li>
      <li>Absorbs well and smells nice without overpowering your senses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this cream, moisture my skin all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself, (the account holder&#x27;s wife), and have done a previous review of it as Michele Miller.  It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer that out-does the old Lancôme Hydrazen.  I would definitely recommend and have re-purchased many times over.</li>
    <li> Want it to be an alternative to Olay Regenerist, but this moisturizer did not make my skin smoother and tender. It has some active ingredients which make my eyes sting. Eclos claims to be a natural brand, but I would only recommend their facial mask.</li>
    <li> ONLY USE IF YOU WANT HEALTHY YOUNGER LOOKING SKIN INSTANTLY!!!!! Seriously, if you smear it on, it acts like a peel. Pretty gross, but the dead skin pours off. Just smear it on, massaging it in, wait alittle while and massage off the dead skin! Will be warming to the skin and alittle redness no more than a healthy glow! At 58 this is my kinda cream! BEST UNDER EYE CREAM OUT THERE.This works better than their eye cream!</li>
    <li> Bought and use it with Serum(see my review on serum).&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thicker(of course)compare to serum and appeared to be stronger.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale and it looked natural and good. Well I have combination dry skin and for the first 2 weeks it irritated my skin which was fine because sometimes that happens. Well after the 2 weeks it stopped irritating but I noticed it was only hydrating when applied. My face was so dry in the dry spots like I put nothing on a few hours later. yet my oily tzone was like an oil slick. so It didnt help either problem at all. I finished the jar and noticed nothing different. Disappointing. I will not try anything els from this line as they have all been misses for me so far.</li>
    <li> I have reordered this after trying it the first time.  It is very dry in Wyoming and this does the trick.  Great ingredients, too!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I am 28 and just started to see small wrinkles the past few months. This cream leaves my skin soft and and I can see a more youthful appearance within a few minutes.  I also bought the intense overnight serum and there is definitely improvement each morning. I wake up excited to look in the mirror and see the results each morning. Amazon has a great price on this line of products but every few weeks ulta has a buy one get one half off on these products and they can be a little cheaper than amazon during that sale.</li>
    <li> I am a make-up artist and currently am going to school for Dermatology. I have skin that is dry, ashy, blotchy, and sometimes itchy too. I am between age groups for young and mature skin (28-33), but still not old enough for anything with severe wrinkle and anti-age protection. I found the ECLOS product line at my local Ulta store. I was out of my old moisturizer and to be honest wasnt that pleased with it&#x27;s performance. I was looking for something that offered all day moisture care and moderate to mild anti-ageing properties. I have never been to keen on jumping the gun on age preventatives in products because i believe that if you start age therapy too soon on young skin, in the end your skin will begin to depend on the things your feeding it on a day to day basis. I also have sensative skin, i am allergic to Salacylic Acid in any %. So that makes it hard to even find cleansing products most of the time. Right away I was intrigued that this product was natural, No Parabens, Sulfates, Perto-Chemicals. I liked that it&#x27;s main ingredient was organic in nature, plant derived from Swiss Apples and uses Plant Stem Cells for anti-age therapy. I purchased the moisturizer blindly, without reading any product reviews...Decided i&#x27;d give it a week on my face as both my day and night cream. Ok laides, pay attention...THIS PRODUCT BLEW ME AWAY!!! The creamy texture of it is well balanced, never heavy, greasy, or oily. I apply it all over my face AND neck. Just enough to get a good even coat (ie: 5 dots of it. One for each cheek, one on my forehead, one on my chin, and then one more for my neck). My skin is moist like i&#x27;ve never felt before, supple and \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;. It has a mild fresh lemmon scent, which is refreshing and disapates after a few minutes. For the last month my skin has been bright, firm, and has had this youthful glow. Even my Fianc&#x27;e has noticed my skin looking younger. He likes the smell, says it&#x27;s pleasant, smells clean and refreshing. The moisture this cream packs isseriously amazing, my skin stays perfectly moist all day long. It&#x27;s almost winter and for years now i&#x27;ve had a hard time with maintaining that moisture in my skin. With this product my search is over. I think the price point of this product is reasonable too, considering i&#x27;ve paid almost $40 for some name brand creams and was disappointed time after time.  Overall, AMAZING MOISTURIZER, great vaule in price! Hope this helps!!!</li>
    <li> I.Loved.This.Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Light and very whipped texture.&lt;br /&gt;  Smelled great, very citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;  I have oily, acne prone skin that scars easily. This product did not make me break out. I didn&#x27;t use it twice as day as recommended. I only applied it to my clean face at night. My skin was super velvety and soft when I awoke. My acne scars brightened considerably. I also used a product with glycolic acid to aid in the lightening of my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;  The price is fan-freaking-tastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Couldn&#x27;t wear it during the day under my makeup. I didn&#x27;t mix well with my powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Plant stem cells? I don&#x27;t know how they do that, but it seems to produce results. I noticed a regenerative sensation, and considerable reduction in signs of aging. The scent is pleasant, the cream is soothing and it made me look and feel younger. The price is definitely right as well. I know that so much of the results of these creams are objective and subject to opinion, so in my opinion, this stuff is the bomb.</li>
    <li> Great product. It smells nice, and does the job well. Really helped to make my skin smooth and well-moisturized, but never clogged my pores. It&#x27;s more expensive than other options out there, but it&#x27;s worth it. Particularly useful as a night cream. I&#x27;ll buy this product from now on. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisture cream for sensitive skin. It does not irritate my skin, has no perfume smell, and it feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v always had a hard time finding a moisterizer that works for me - sensitive to combo skin and now I&#x27;m into the 50 yr range which just adds to my issue of finding that just right cream. I&#x27;m on my 2nd container [I think using about 4 month or so?], and my skin has never been better.</li>
    <li> I def noticed my pores have gotten smaller, which is pretty awesome. My skin is soft and well moisturized. It has an OK smell, nothing over powering. It doesn&#x27;t feel to thick or greasy. I use it every morning and I like it. I havent noticed any tightening of my skin or reduction in fine lines, just the smaller pores. Remarkably smaller pores. Ive been using it about 3-4 weeks now.</li>
    <li> This product is for those of you that cannot put anything on your face because you break out. My skin is prone to breaking out for any and every reason. When I saw the ingredients this product had I thought it would be worth a try. I am so happy I did. My face never broke out, I was thinking that for sure I would break out in the beginning while my face adjusted to it. But no I never did. It even helped heal some small pimples that were stubborn in going away. I was amazed! I use it every other day at night only, a small dime size each on each cheek, forehead, chin, and neck. I strongly recommend this product! I&#x27;ve tried so many organic products but all just caused me to break out after a few days of using it. This product never caused me any breakout and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 1 month!!! Now if they only made make up!!!!  Result: super soft skin, texture appears more even, makeup goes on so much better in the morning, compliments on face galore.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the Eclos Moisture Therapy Regenerative Cream.  It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy and seems to provide a good moisturizing effect.  It does brighten dullness and I can notice a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.  At its price point, the Eclos cream certainly holds its own against expensive department store brands and provides as good or better skin benefits.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Paraben &amp; sulfate-free; no synthetic fragrances or dyes; no mineral oil or petroleum. I applied a good amount every evening after washing my face and my skin truly was feeling less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formulated with extract from Uttwiler Sp&amp;auml;tlauber, a Swiss Apple harvested since the 1800s and characteristic for looking newly harvested 4 months after picking. Search the name on the internet for all sorts of articles going back to 2009/2010. Oddly I couldn&#x27;t find the apple in the list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water,&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin,&lt;br /&gt;Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone,&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane,&lt;br /&gt;Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter),&lt;br /&gt;Ethylhexyl Palmitate,&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl Stearate,&lt;br /&gt;Polysilicone-11,&lt;br /&gt;Palmitoyl Glycine,&lt;br /&gt;PEG-100 Stearate,&lt;br /&gt;Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Centella Asiatica Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Curcuma Zedoaria Leaf Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl Acetate,&lt;br /&gt;Amyris Barsamifera Bark Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Cananga Odorata Flower Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Cymbopogon Martini Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Sorbitan Stearate,&lt;br /&gt;Nylon-12,&lt;br /&gt;Silica,&lt;br /&gt;PEG-10 Dimethicone,&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 40,&lt;br /&gt;Isohexadecane,&lt;br /&gt;Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate,&lt;br /&gt;Polyacrylamide,&lt;br /&gt;C13-14 Isoparaffin,&lt;br /&gt;Laureth-7,&lt;br /&gt;Xanthan Gum,&lt;br /&gt;Lecithin,&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium Aluminum Silicate,&lt;br /&gt;Disodium EDTA,&lt;br /&gt;Carbomer,&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol,&lt;br /&gt;Caprylyl Glycol,&lt;br /&gt;Sorbic Acid,&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Hydroxide</li>
    <li> My skin is usually low maintenance, but gets dry in the winter. This product is fantastic! I have been using it for the past 2-3 weeks and my skin feels great. I used to use an eye cream but this cream seems to make it unnecessary so I&#x27;ve been skipping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this cream is all natural. Since avalon reformulated their vitamin C face creams I had been looking for another hydrating cream that made my skin feel great and I think this is it. It also has a wonderful light scent. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was hooked on the Eclos line after trying their skin prep cleanser; the products ended up being on a super-mega sale a couple of weeks later-- so I took it as a sign of good luck and bought the rest of the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an oil-slick girl that lives in humid weather two-thirds of the year, and even though I handle my skin well, I still get some breakouts that are rather annoying (especially during the hormonal fluctuations during that time of the month). After sticking with the Eclos line for about a month now, I&#x27;ve thrown away / completely stopped using my Body Shop, Ponds and Neutrogena products. This is actually one of the most shocking things I&#x27;ve realized about my regime, since I&#x27;m a product hoarder and can&#x27;t stand to see something be tossed until it&#x27;s used to a certain extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This line really kicks some ass, and it does a great job at balancing my skin&#x27;s oil production. My favorite aspects include the scars on my problem areas being diminished, my pores refined, and my skin getting that dewy glow that&#x27;s seen in Asian skin care posters and celebrities. Every day I&#x27;ve been waking up only needing minimal concealer, blush and mascara. It definitely holds true to the anti-aging properties found in the products; I&#x27;m about to graduate college, but lately my younger sister&#x27;s (high school grad) friends now assume she&#x27;s the oldest in the family. (It&#x27;s also hilarious I&#x27;ve been getting way more ID checks at gas stations and stores, too, lol.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s ever a godsend in this world, this line is one of them. Deeeefinitely hooked, and I really hope it stays that way.</li>
    <li> Really like the Eclos products!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products and found this line to be more effective than some of the more expensive department store brands.  Everyone is going to wrinkle at some point but these products seem to relax my \\&quot;time lines\\&quot;. I noticed a difference within a week of use (I use the serum and regenerative cream twice daily w/sunscreen in AM) and appreciate the clean smell, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived within a week and intact.  Great way to shop!</li>
    <li> I just love how it makes my face feel and look.  I&#x27;m 36 and I feel like it gives me a glow.  I just really like this product.</li>
    <li> This cream first off is a little heavy. You definitely do not need a lot but it smoothes into the skin easily. Heavy but a very nice silky texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in the mornings and evenings after doing a facial exfoliation scrubbing (usually I only do this harsher scrub three times a week) and truly believe it has made a huge difference in the lines around my smile and between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I especially like about it is all the things that aren&#x27;t in it and that it uses plant stem cell for the regenerative therapy rather than anything else chemically created. Someone mentioned the smell and I really don&#x27;t notice an overpowering one at all. However, I do use quite a bit of different lotions all with differing smells so maybe I&#x27;ve built up a resistance to odd smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is extremely good for a regenerative lotion. I pay more for my night and daily cream that I use every night.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, the lack of parabens is a plus, and yes, plant stem cells are supposed to be great (although I haven&#x27;t seen any impact from past products I&#x27;ve used that feature them). This thick cream is an excellent moisturizer for night only--unless you have dry skin. I found it was too thick/takes too long to absorb for daytime use under makeup, but my skin is normal in winter/combination in summer. The smell is pleasant, and the moisturizing impact certainly lasts all night. Would recommend as an economical, natural all-around good choice for a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since found that Eclos has a whole skin system if you&#x27;re interested in checking it out. I haven&#x27;t tried it, but apparently you can buy a starter kit that&#x27;s a decent way to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> This cream is very smooth, pleasantly scented (I can&#x27;t stand strong scents) and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.  I don&#x27;t know that it has made much of difference with my lines and wrinkles, but they haven&#x27;t gotten worse!</li>
    <li> Got this one after an extensive use and satisfaction I have had with the Eclos Cellular activator face serum.&lt;br /&gt;But with this Eclos product I am very unhappy: It is too greasy, it does not soak into the skin and stays on and on like the old-fashion grandma sticky old recipes for skin spread.&lt;br /&gt;Modern technologies enables cream manufacturers to make the cream penetrate (minimally) the three outer layers of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This Eclos effort does not penetrate even the first outer skin layer: it stays there oily, fatty and greasy.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and light scent of this cream.  After using it for several weeks I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin but it does a good job as a night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> What I noticed first was it gives you a different type of clean. Beyond that I liked the fact the kit has everything I need including mask and scrub. I have acne prone skin it has not irritated my skin and after washing my face my skin literally has a glow to it. Very nice.</li>
    <li> For normal skin, Eclos performs as advertised as a light weight cream for fine lines and wrinkles under make-up. No fragrance and absorbs quickly ... Eclos Moisture Therapy is an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> Even before I ordered this product, I was excited about it.  This skin moisturizer is made with stem cells from a very interesting apple called the Uttwiler Spatlauber apple.  After reading about the specific apple and the general concept of plant stem cell products, I was ready to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that I have noticed a significant change in my skin over the past 3 weeks of using this cream.  The only thing I have noticed is a slight change in skin texture on my forehead when comparing my own \\&quot;before\\&quot; photos of my face.  Once or twice I used the creme under my eyes, but it was a little too strong for my sensitive, under eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a very pleasant, mild smell.  This may not be a plus for those with sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rich in texture, but does not sit heavy on the face.  I did not notice it after it was applied in the morning.  It also did well with my night application.  Prior to using this product, I was using very basic oils on my skin to decrease the amount of toxins that might be absorbed into the skin.  This product has done very well in my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might consider using it again depending on how my skin responds after I return to my previous regimen of simple olive oil, rose water, and jojoba oil. We shall see...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for both night and day the last four weeks and have been very pleased with it.  First let me say that I&#x27;m over 60 and love the sun, so my skin has been damaged a bit the last few years.  I am a little concerned about skin cancer, and I&#x27;ve tried different products to slow down or (hopefully) stop the dryness and wrinkles that naturally come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different skin creams to help my skin, and this seems to be one of the better ones I have found. I may be asing too much from a product like this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer commented on the smell being strong but I didn&#x27;t find it offensive and after applying it the smell was light and quickly went away almost entirely.  It absorbs quickly and has never been greasy so it works well while sleeping and also before applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall opinion is that I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results so far.  I will continue using this product a bit longer to see if the long term results are better.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!  I saw a difference the first time I actually used it which is shocking.  Usually it takes a while and then sometimes its so minimal it&#x27;s kind of not worth it.  This product is much different than anything I have used  natural or full blown chemicals.  This product works.  Well it works for me.  You don&#x27;t need to use much - it goes a long way too. I am very happy with it!  I am 52 with some wrinkling starting. I live in Southern California so we experience dry and humid air.  Works in both and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  A little bit when you first apply but doesn&#x27;t stay greasy or sticky.  Try their scrub and clay mask - both are great as well as the serum!</li>
    <li> I use the Eclos Cellular Activator Face Serum so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  While the serum is great, the cream is not.  After 2 applications, I had 3 big zits form on my forehead.  I never get acne and I know this wasn&#x27;t a coincidence.  I immediately stopped using this product and the zits went away and haven&#x27;t returned.  It may work for some, but not for me.</li>
    <li> I have aging, sensitive skin and I try to use a good quality facial wash and moisturizer twice a day. I also like to use natural products. What we put on our skin, make-up and creams - is absorbed into our bodies and I figure it&#x27;s good to keep using natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this cream. It&#x27;s very rich, but not greasy and my skin is feeling very smooth and hydrated. It does have a strong scent at first, but I like it. They use essential oils for the scent including Rosewood and Geranium and it&#x27;s got a bit of a citrusey quality, which smells good to me. This cream has Apple stem cells, Shea butter, olive oil and vitamin E in it and it doesn&#x27;t have any parabens, sulfates, synthetic fragrance or mineral oil. I like it enough, that I plan on buying their cleanser and some of their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better is the price, which is so reasonable for a good moisturizer. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I had my daughter try this cream, and she loves it. For these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;(1) It works. Her skin gets really dry in winter, and this cream has eliminated the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;(2) It is not greasy and hence leaves no greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;(3) It has a good price, less than other creams she has used that didn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;(4) And a little goes a long way. So the 2 ounces will probably last for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;(5) She plans on buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is wonderful and soothing, even on my very acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and not only have I had no breakouts, my skin has seriously looked fresh and moisturized. It has a light scent that is a little unusual, very green and clean smelling, and even my husband likes the smell! Also, it is a generously sized jar- while I will definitely be re-ordering this, to use as my new go-to product, I won&#x27;t have to order for a while- a little goes a long way, without stinting, and absorbs beautifully into the skin.</li>
    <li> Until I tried this face cream, I thought my issues with fragrance were all about synthetic fragrances.  But this cream is made without synthetic fragrances and I still have a problem with the scent being too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made from a number of different plant extracts and I think the chamomile extract is what I smell quite strongly when I first put it in.  The scent does not make me want to tear my skin off as is sometimes the case with synthetic fragrances, but it does smell strongly enough to me that it is not pleasant.  After a while the scent dissipates but the initial impression is quite strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of my issues with the scent, I did not use this often enough to determine whether it worked well on my face or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know that sometimes certain scents are so overpowering for me that I can smell them when others can&#x27;t.  So this cream might not even seem as if it had a scent to other users.  But this isn&#x27;t the face cream for me because of my issues with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is unfortunate because it is made without parabens, sulfates, synthetic fragrances, synthetic dyes and mineral oil or petroleum, which I like uin principle.</li>
    <li> I swapped this cream into my regular beauty routine a few weeks ago.  Now, when you get to be my age (older than dirt) it becomes less about \\&quot;looking younger\\&quot; and more about \\&quot;not looking any older\\&quot;.  Hey, creams, lotions and serums can only do so much, especially if you didn&#x27;t start using them until you were already well into your thirties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this cream definitely passed my test.  It&#x27;s very rich and thick but it absorbed quickly enough without a lot of rubbing (vigorous rubbing is bad for your face after all).  It has an herbaceous scent which I found slightly familiar and pleasant.  My skin feels smooth and well hydrated (no tight feeling) and it didn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy or look shiny (a sign that a lot of the emollients are sitting on top of your skin).  I also didn&#x27;t have any trouble with irritation or break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it says to use this in the a.m. and p.m. but I only used it at night because of its lack of sun screen (to speed things up in the morning I always use a moisturizer with at least an SPF-30) and because right after applying, this cream can feel a tiny bit tacky, which goes away after a few minutes but can slow down your make-up routine on busy mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a nice, rich cream that can hold it&#x27;s own against much more expensive options.  Great for night time but with a few minor shortcomings which could slow you down in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! But... It&#x27;s weird how it makes my face sweat if I do anything active while it&#x27;s on my face. It does seem like it warms my skin, so I use it in the winter. Kind of slick on my face, doesn&#x27;t really absorb very well. The smell is heavenly though so I use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick and makes my face feel oily. Better to use when goung to bed.</li>
    <li> I have tried for one weeks and caused some break out on my face, so I just stop using it and use my old product again (Natural Republic: Aloe Cream). I guess different skin type has different effect. I have a oily(T-zone) and dry skin. It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good moisture cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the way my skin is reacting positively to this cream!  It is incredible stuff.  I have sensitive, blotchy, eczema skin, and some difficult areas are quickly clearing up when medicine was doing nothing.  My forehead is often dry and flaky and now it is smooth.  I even dabbed some on the back of my neck, which is often blotchy and creased and it is already healing.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  It&#x27;s almost too good to be true, except that it IS true!</li>
    <li> I am extremely nit-picky about the type of moisturizer I use...extremely picky. I prefer super light-weight, quick absorbing moisturizers (and if they have a cooling effect...that&#x27;s a bonus). Eclos is very heavy on my skin; if 10 were the heaviest I would put this at a 7 or 8. Also, my skin does not seem to want to absorb into my skin and just sits on the surface making me feel oily and paranoid. Everyone is different in their preferences for moisturizers; some people prefer putting something heavier on their skin right before bed and with the cold weather coming on strong I can imagine for those people that this would be rather nice.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free-to-review product, and usually I am VERY skeptical about facial products because 1) I have sensitive skin 2) I have many allergies which cause can cause blistering, itching, or other unpleasant side effects 3) smells really bother me 4) I usually stick with the most basic skincare products because I haven&#x27;t found the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of skincare yet.  And my skin is a young-looking late 40s, very fair, sometimes dry, sometimes greasy, occasionally splotchy, freckly in strange places, and I still get blemishes and an occasional blackhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well believe it or not I LOVE this product!  I have been using it faithfully for just over 2 weeks and, although I have not noticed any wrinkles/smile lines/character lines or whatever you care to call them totally disappearing, they are definitely less noticeable.  Here&#x27;s my routine:  I just use Tone soap in the shower (I like the smell), I don&#x27;t dry my face with the towel but use another product called Exfolia Microexfoliation Beauty Cloth.  I have no idea how this cloth works but it scrubs off all the dead skin and rough patches like nothing I have ever tried before.  So after showering I do a quick scrub of my face and neck with the Exfolia cloth, then apply the Eclos Moisture Therapy Cream.  With the gently exfoliated and damp face, the moisturizer goes on so smoothly and soaks right in.  I have noticed that a little is enough, you don&#x27;t have to glob this on to get enough coverage.  My skin has looked much brighter and radiant without having that glitter-like crap hidden in the cream (I hate glitter and I avoid those lotions that sneak it in as a \\&quot;brightener\\&quot;).  This Eclos is just very basic ingredients--it is made without Parabens, Sulfates, Synthetic Fragrances, Synthetic Dyes, and without Mineral Oil or Petroleum.  I have no idea about the Apple Stem Cell Technology at work in this lotion but I can tell you that my blotchiness has evened out, my skin feels wonderful, the lotion doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gloppy, and I have actually enjoyed using it--it doesn&#x27;t feel like \\&quot;work\\&quot; to apply.  At first my skin did seem a little shinier than usual but it wasn&#x27;t a greasy-looking shine.  I have noticed that stubborn blemishes have faded more quickly, my skin is much more supple, feels great, and overall texture has evened out.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any scent to the cream, I&#x27;d say the scent is so light it could be almost unscented.  I noticed how nice my fingers felt after applying it to my face so sometimes I&#x27;ll even use it on my hands, and the backs of my hands do look much more supple and my cuticles feel wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, once my sample is gone I will *definitely* purchase this product. I love how my skin feels and looks after using Eclos Moisture Therapy Regenerative Cream--I think I found my Holy Grail in my skincare routine.eavy or gloppy, and I have actually enjoyed using it--it doesn&#x27;t feel like \\&quot;work\\&quot; to apply.

    <li> I am pretty skeptical about the apple stem cell extract claims but as a moisturizer, I like this product.  After 5 weeks of use I did not not really notice any anti-aging effects but my pores seemed a bit tighter and  clearer. As a moisturizer, this did a nice job.  It absorbed quickly and completely and left my skin with a nice clean feel.  I did notice a bit of a stinging feel when I first begin to use this product.  This did not lead to any irritation or redness, if anything, my skin seemed to be a bit calmer. So in summary, a good moisturizer.  Yes it contains a hyped up trendy extract with unproven claims but it is a solid performer.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It has everything I look for in a face cream.&lt;br /&gt;1). It&#x27;s substantial, with the consistency of a good mayonnaise without being greasy.  Lots of products on the market pour like lotion and feel watery.  Not this stuff.  It takes a few minutes to absorb into the skin and it doesn&#x27;t totally absorb right away.  I&#x27;ve been using it as a night cream.  It leaves a bit of a residue, but not of the 1950s variety, and that&#x27;s gone by morning.  I like that--it makes me feel like it&#x27;s really working on my skin--and there&#x27;s not enough that my husband has even noticed. (Apologies if that&#x27;s TMI!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2). The fragrance is light and undefinable.  It&#x27;s just pleasant, and goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The results are amazing!  Since I just had a milestone birthday, I&#x27;ve altered a number of things in my skin are and makeup. I experimented with leaving off and substituting elements to see if the Eclos really makes that much of a difference.  Yup, it&#x27;s the Eclos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4). I&#x27;ve recently started using Korean BB creams.  If you have any experience with those, you know that it&#x27;s important to use a really good moisturizer before applying the BB, otherwise the BB settles in the cracks and wrinkles and makes  you look old and dry.  The Eclos TRC is the perfect product to use under a BB.  It goes on gooey and combines with the BB to give a flawless finish that really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed after about 10 days:  My skin looks brighter and smoother, which is amazing, considering I&#x27;ve also had horrible sinus issues/cold/flu things going on for the last week or so.  It&#x27;s a je ne sais quoi thing and the only way it can be described is that my skin just just looks better.  When I leave off the Eclos, I can tell.  There is definite improvement, despite the flu nasties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is a no brainer.  I&#x27;ve used many, many products, at all price points.  The Eclos TRC is comparable to Dr. Perricone&#x27;s cream that comes in a jar and sells for about four times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re already a dewy cheeked young thing, maybe this isn&#x27;t a must-have, but for those of us for whom peaches and cream is now only a summer dessert, it&#x27;s SO worth a try!sells for about four times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re already a dewy cheeked young thing, maybe this isn&#x27;t a must-have, but for those of us for whom peaches and cream is now only a summer dessert, it&#x27;s SO worth a try!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It&#x27;s as good as others I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m happy with the ingredients.  Would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to moisturizer for over four years.  My sensitive 66 year-old skin loves the purity of its natural ingredients and the softness and suppleness the cream produces.  I&#x27;m still asked to show proof of age to qualify for senior discounts, probably the ultimate testimonial for this great product!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and had struggled all of my life to find something that wasn&#x27;t too heavy, too abrasive, or too light. I tried this a few years ago and fell in love with it! It&#x27;s light and is absorbed easily so I never feel greasy, yet it moisturizes so I never feel dry. Perfect fit for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this on my face every day because my skin has enough natural oil.  I have been using it on my arms (where I have some excema) and my chest area almost nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My excema would normally be getting worse this time of year (Fall) because of the dry weather. It is actually doing fairly well, its a bit better actually.  My chest&#x27;s skin is very smooth and firm feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy this cream because it doesn&#x27;t leave my feeling greasy or oily (even on my face) after I&#x27;ve put it on. I also really like the smell. Not only is it different than the weird old-lady chemical baby power smell that so many facial creams have, but its rather pleasant. It has a refreshing ginger sent--and it isn&#x27;t one that lingers around too long. Which I also really like about it, as I don&#x27;t like smelling like a bouquet all day</li>
    <li> The Eclos moisture theraphy regenerative cream has blown me away with the results. I use to have a terrible itching/scratching problem all over my body. Sweat and itching around the joints is a nightmare for itchy people. I&#x27;ve since stopped scratching, but I now have scars I&#x27;ve acculmauted over the years. Just for your reference, I&#x27;m 24, male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the Eclos cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them on my chest, the elbow pit (Not sure how else to describe), and legs. The reduction of inflammation and dark spots is noticeable. My skin feels tighter and smoother. I really don&#x27;t know how the apple stem cells work, but it has done wonders in a short period of time. I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks daily before I sleep. The little jar actually has a generous amount. You only need a little pinch to cover an area of skin. It&#x27;s not like body lotion, which requires a lot to sink into the skin. A little bit of Eclos absorbs and goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing. At this price, and if you have skin problems or just looking to tighten your skin, I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  I bought a sample kit and was surprised by how quickly I noticed an improvement in my skin.  This product in particular stood out.  Excellent at moisturizing and smoothing out fine lines.  Any cons?  I don&#x27;t use it too close to the eye area because it&#x27;s a bit harsh there and I find it is slightly greasy on my forehead but nothing some powder can&#x27;t cure.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.....I have been purchasing new and different moisturizers for a couple years now, just trying out different products.  I have been using this one for a week, and already notice a difference in my skin for the better.  So far, I love it.  My skin is dry, aging, and sun damaged.  I am 35 with tons of freckles and sun spots.  Since using this, my skin has improved in tone.  Also, it rates well on EWG&#x27;s skin deep website.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the positive reviews, this product really works! It might not erase 20 years of damage completely but it certainly smoothes fine wrinkles and makes the skin look and feel clean, velvety and radiant. Beware of prices though; brick-and-mortar stores (like Target and Walgreen) carry Eclos products 50% cheaper than some sellers on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I never rewiew, ever. I&#x27;m 26, African American and I&#x27;ve always had pigmentation problems, soooo crazy me I decided to get a chemical peel and I don&#x27;t know if you ever had a chemical peel but it left my skin sooooo dry that the skin cracked, peeled, itched and sometimes it bleed, they gave me expensive products to buy and use nothing worked or it burned, my skin was dry, and itching like crazy... So desperately I went to CVS (a local pharmacy) and started reading the ingrediance of different products, and came across this one, I was sceptical. I looked it up read some revews, 90% positive reviews, so I got it... BTW it was $22 at CVS, but I would pay what this guy is asking because as soon as I got to the car I put it on, I kid u not 20min later my skin was back, the icthing stoped, my elasticity came back, it works.. Thank God!!!! I was going crazy, I&#x27;m 26 years old I don&#x27;t use it for wrinkles or anything like that, but the moisture lasted all day, I didn&#x27;t even have to reapply. This stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> This product is so wonderfull and my sister wont use anything else! It is getting so hard to find in stores so to give as a gift for her I came to Amazon and there it was and there are more of the brand Eclos to choose from and there is a starter kit very reasonably priced if you need to check it out and you wont be sorry and there is no expiration on this product.</li>
    <li> I first bought this Eclos Cream as a clearance item at a local Target.  I&#x27;ve been so impressed with the results that I don&#x27;t want to run out!  I use it mostly on my neck and I don&#x27;t have the wrinkles and loose skin that most women in their late 50&#x27;s have!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> As a female of course I&#x27;ve tried sooo many moisturizers. Olay, Garnier, Loreal, you name it. Bought this one on a whim a year ago and I haven&#x27;t switched off it since. It really does leave your skin glowy and moisturized. I use it every morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> After using Eclos Moisture Therapy Regenerative Cream for about a month, I have decided that this relatively inexpensive cream will definitely become a part of my daily regime.  While I cannot say that I have a lot of wrinkles and therefore cannot testify to any before and after miracles with regard to diminishing lines,  I will say that this cream is a dream to put on day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may not seem like much to say, but for me it is a big deal.  I also use [[ASIN:B005XMVYBY L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle Precious Cream, 1.7 oz.]] and another product called [[ASIN:B000J47AGY Sea Chi Creme 4.17oz/125ml]], both of which are almost three times the price of this Eclos product.  During the month that I used the Eclos Regenerative cream, I did NOT find the need to use the two other products that I usually use.  The Eclos product performed just as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to heavily scented creams and lotions.  The Eclos Regenerative Cream does have a scent, but it is benign to my overly sensitive nose.  This is a good thing because I would not be able to even try out this product if its scent was overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product contains apple stem cells and the packaging claims that they have been clinically proven to reduce wrinkles and stem cells in two weeks.  I will say that this product did promote a smoother, more even texture to my skin just like the product literature claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?  The Eclos Moisture Therapy Regenerative Cream is a good product at a good price.  I have used it day and night for a month and have enjoyed fresh feeling skin with no allergic reaction.  I would buy this product regularly.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Diana Faillace Von Behren&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;reneofc\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The Eclos Moisture Therapy Regenerative Cream is a medium-weight moisturizer to be used day and night.  I like the texture, but the fragrance of the cream is off-putting.  It has the odor of a facial hair bleach.  This does not detract from the appeal of the way it feels on the face.  I think it truly is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> New cream for me but it seems already to work nicely. I gave it four stars rather than five because of the lemony smell. Yuck. It smells like a household cleaner. Already though, it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like the Reviva Organic Antioxidant and Texturizing Day Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I did read plenty of rave reviews for this before I made the purchase. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Just really don&#x27;t like the smell for a face cream. Thankfully, it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> Use in combination with the other products and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I like this line.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and effective.</li>
    <li> One of the first reviewers said that this was so natural and had no petroleum by-products.  Bull!  It has several: dimethicone, (potential skin irritant), cyclopentasiloxane, and  polysilicone11.  Paraben-free creams are now sheepishly being preserved with Phenoxyethanol which has been BANNED in Europe!  There are other toxic ingredients in this product as well.  I would not recommend this product to anyone if you are concerned with health.  Over 60% of what we put on our skin gets absorbed directly into the bloodstream.  I advise people to consult EWG&#x27;s web-page to learn more about toxic ingredins in skincare.  Always go with quality, petro-free, non-toxic skincare and don&#x27;t just go by the smell or how it feels on your skin.  That&#x27;s deceptive.</li>
    <li> I put this on every night before I go to bed and it sinks right in  No messy face  very smooth</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer, especially because I have such sensitive skin and have tried so many products. The only thing is I wish the packaging were in a pump not a tub.</li>
    <li> It was a good face lotion, liked it a lot!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and l really love it! Smells yummy and not too greasy. Nice natural ingredients. I&#x27;m only sad that Walgreens quit carrying it and now I have to order online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for a great moisturizer with a reasonable price for probably a few decades.  The moisuture cream, unlike almost every other product on the market, really lasts all day.  On top of this, every product in the whole line delivers with the same high results.  I also love the scent.  I hope it&#x27;s around forever!</li>
    <li> This is a nice smooth-flowing cream which leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed.  It does have a kind of medicinal fragrance which is a bit off-putting.</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this product along with the serum, I&#x27;ve noticed a visible improvement in skin tone and a reduction in wrinkle lines-one was fairly deep.  I put the serum on and then apply the cream over it.  Have been using it for about a month and will most definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased the trial kit at Walgreens for $20 ( valued at 40) which had 5 different products in it including this one. I recently had a facial and it reminded me of eminence smell ( I very high dollar and amazing brand) tho is much cheaper and so far I&#x27;m in love with it! Especially the cleanser and scrub.</li>
    <li> I have one nasty wrinkle on my forehead.  I call him Wally Worrywort. It&#x27;s one deep wrinkle.  I have bangs and so no one can see Wally.  But I know he&#x27;s there.  This cream made Wally much less severe. It also made my skin feel soft, but not greasy.  Clean and fresh despite the addition of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is white in color, it is thick and has a light scent.  I like the clean packaging as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really like the fresh bright results I got from this one.  It&#x27;s a great every day moisturizer.  However, why no 15 SPF?  That would make it perfect for me living in Florida.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this lightweight, comfortable moisturizer. I&#x27;m not sure about its regenerative effects but I get compliments on my complexion, especially when I reveal my age, LOL. Amazon&#x27;s prices for this product are great as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38, Italian and have had life long ance I keep at bay only through copious facials. This is the only product line I have ever found to not break me out - It&#x27;s outstanding and a total gem for ladies who struggle sensitive, oily skin. I have tried everything and have even had some of the top beauty brands as clients. (I&#x27;m a designer by trade.) This stuff is hands down the best thing I have ever found including all of the natural Sephora brands. The only other thing I can suggest that will even comes close is Ren&#x27;s line. The Shiseido line for acne is good as well, but drying. The Eclos line will not dry skin or break you out. It rocks. Warning the price fluctuates like crazy so if you see it at $12 for the wash or under $20 for the moisturizer, snag two if you end up liking it. Around the holidays this year the whole line was in short supply.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I don&#x27;t break out and it makes my skin feel really good.  I live in a very dry climate and moisturizers like this are crucial.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with this cream and it does seem to have a regenerative effect on my skin.  I am approaching middle age and having young children later in life does add a bit of extra wear and tear on me (even though they also add joy).  Since starting this cream my skin is not only looking younger but I have that glow that I just assumed I would not have in quite the same way again.</li>
    <li> lightweight.. doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin.. overall satisfied.. not oily, and moisturizes well.. the smell is ok.  price seems reasonable for what you get</li>
    <li> Really love this cream.  Most of all my face loves it.  Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first night cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I really like how it makes my skin feel in the morning.  The scent is fresh and relaxing.</li>
    <li> After the Serum has soaked into the dermal cells, the moistur therapy keeps my skin feeling elastic all day long. I&#x27;ve been trying various products over the counter and direct sales. Loreal, Eucerin, Lumene&#x60;, Almond oil. None of which has pleased me as much as Eclos.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the Eclos Moisture Therapy Regenerative Cream in a Target and LOVED it - best moisturizer I have ever used! However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the scoop:&lt;br /&gt;***My first experience with the Eclos moisturizer *from when I purchased it at a Target store -&lt;br /&gt;(Previously) manufactured by Delicious Brands, LLC and marketed with having &amp;#34;Plant Stem Cells A Swiss Phyto Extract&amp;#34;. The formulation was smooth with a faintly sweet smell. Best of all it was 100% completely un-greasy and light on the skin. Seriously, when I first began to use it I questioned if I was applying enough since it didn&#x27;t feel like I had put on any moisturizer at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had amazing results -&lt;br /&gt;1. so, my pores are hoarders - I have a history of problems using a product consistently due to clogging and randomly breaking out or getting into the vicious &amp;#34;moisturize.. clogged pores.. astringent.. dry and flaky.. moisturize.. clogged pores....&amp;#34; cycle.&lt;br /&gt;After the initial 2-week adjustment period with the eclos moisturizer I had NONE of it - no fighting clogged pores, no excessive blackheads, my skin consistently felt and looked healthy. Even when I would introduce a new product, I felt like the moisturizer was helping to protect my skin from overreacting.&lt;br /&gt;2. by the end of the jar it was obvious to me that my skin was brighter, more firm and the little signs of aging I would stare at before were not as prominent. Best of all very natural ingredients, no parabens, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***CURRENT Product, purchased on Amazon.com  -&lt;br /&gt;The Eclos skincare line was purchased (early 2012) and is now being manufactured by Freeman Beauty; Eclos is no longer made by Delicious Brands, LLC. It is now marketed specifically with &amp;#34;Apple Stem Cell Technology&amp;#34; and is (per Freeman website) &amp;#34;paraben-free, sulfate-free, free of synthetic fragrances, synthetic dyes, mineral oil and petroleum.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for between 4-6 months now and the results are in -&lt;br /&gt;1. First off, there was a noticeable difference in the smell - it&#x27;s no longer sweet, I really don&#x27;t know how to describe it - reminiscent of an astringent (but not chemical smelling).&lt;br /&gt;2. The moisturizer itself feels a little thicker and heavier than before - I can feel it in my pores now after I put it on. I wouldn&#x27;t say greasy, but I feel the layer sitting on top of my face.&lt;br /&gt;3. I am back to fighting the clogged pores...and I see the little lines under my eyes and on my forehead again *sigh*&lt;br /&gt;5. Major issue is that my foundation now settles on my skin differently - I can see it in my pores / on my face a few hours after I put on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad moisturizer and definitely a better choice than the ones formulated with primarily toxic substances, but for me it&#x27;s the end of the eclos honeymoon. I am beginning the search for a new moisturizer with which to fight the age-old battle of time....I refuse to relinquish the firmness of my dermis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note - I have no data to confirm that there was any change to the formulation of the moisturizer, but that is definitely my (disappointed) opinion. I should have known such a great, reasonably priced product was too good to last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Service review:&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was timely, no issues!</li>
    <li> Best cream I have found hands down. I use it day and night. Summer and winter. I go through dry spells with my skin on the winter, while summer months are not too bad for me. This cream gets me through all the seasons. Great when I&#x27;m extra dry and great (not greasy) in the summer! It&#x27;s not really thick or heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re just spreading water over your face either...and the moisture STAYS. Unlike some creams that absorb and it&#x27;s like you never even applied...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is something to get used to, kinda citrus-y, but after using this for a couple years I have grown to like it. Definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this at ULTA, but they stopped carrying it! So...thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I had buy for this price. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and it&#x27;s doing the trick.</li>
    <li> I had been using Loreal&#x27;s youth code moisturizer, which worked fairly well.  However, I still broke out from time to time.  A friend of mine suggested the Eclos line.  I had never heard of Eclos products. Based on the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I am very glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not heavy but is very moisturizing.  I use it under my makeup each morning.  It absorbs quickly without feeling greasy.  I like it so much that I am using it as a night cream as well.  With the cold weather coming up, I&#x27;m interesting to see this will work well as my winter night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I heard such great reviews on this. So I bought it , I have only been using it for a little over a month now- no results yet.</li>
    <li> Great Cream... I like it.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this at a local bed bath n beyond n enjoyed the moisturizing effect n it smell awesome!&lt;br /&gt;They stoppered carrying this line, so I ordered it from amazon ......at $2 cheaper!</li>
    <li> Great product. Feels  good on my skin</li>
    <li> I love this cream/moisturizer. I have acne prone skin but since I&#x60;ve been using this I haven&#x60;t had any breakouts and I&#x60;ve never woken up with a greasy face (as often happened with other creams I used).  It significantly reduced the dark spots and sun damage I have on my cheeks. And it smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product that WORKS. Moisturizes your face without making it look or feel greasy at all. The ONLY thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is the very slight medicine-like scent but I&#x27;d rather that than anything floral.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for dry skin!! Absorbs well and smells nice without overpowering your senses.</li>
    <li> I have been using eclos for a while now and loved it.  Just received another order from king of deals and it is no resemblance of cream inside!  It&#x27;s just a gooey greasy blob.  I am returning it and never ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> I had been using Lancôme HydraZen for dry skin for years and loved it but they discontinued it.  I spent hundreds looking for something that actually moisturized without being heavy nor too light.  It didn&#x27;t matter what I tried, nothing seemed to actually moisturize - it either did nothing, or was just thick and laid on my skin.  This is an amazing moisturizer and I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years now.  It&#x27;s 1/4 of the price of the Lancôme one, and my only very slight dislike is it smells a tiny bit medicinal, but that soon disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not thick nor thin, just the right consistency.  It sinks into your skin and leaves a lovely dewy feeling on your face.  I couldn&#x27;t be without it, seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in a very humid climate, and this moisturizer really does the trick due to its fast absorbency.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  It would work for any skin type most likely due to its non greasy composition.  It does what you need it to do.  Very happy with it, despite the money I spent trying to find it!</li>
    <li> This has not really worked for me.  I used Baby Face crème before starting this, and I found that a better product for my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered two jars.  One was very thick.  I was concerned it was old.  The other seemed fine.</li>
    <li> And this cream is the center piece around which it all revolves. Using the Eclos system has made my 47 year old skin look years younger after just 3 or so weeks of use: my skin is hydrated, little lines less noticeable, ruddiness calmed, and generally brightened. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 2 years or more. I have very few lines and have not gotten more during that time. This cream is also non-irritating and is not greasy at all. Lovely moisturizer</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Rich and thick but it absorbs easily and makes my skin feel moist without greasiness or excessive wetness.</li>
    <li> Immediate difference in the look and feel of skin! It is not a miracle cream, but the results are better than anything else I have used. Easiest for me to see the difference in how my hands looked...so, looking forward to trying the body cream! It feels clean on, not greasy (I have combination skin). I don&#x27;t know why I even bother with anything else...and I won&#x27;t anymore! I love everything in the line and have used all but 2 of their products.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using it for one year and my skin has definitely improve in texture and it looks over all better. I would recommend this cream to any one that wants a young looking skin. Also It seem to have helped with breakouts.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give a young man&#x27;s perspective and experience on using almost half of the Eclos line.  What attracted me to these products were the natural ingredients (no dyes, fragrances or petrochemicals), as well as anti-aging properties.  *I use the regenerative cream in combination with the serum both day and night, and a mixture of SPF 15 lotion from the Body Shop.  I&#x27;ve purchased the mud-mask, but have not used it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone will experience these products differently, so I recommend doing a patch test first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin-type:&lt;br /&gt;-Oily T-zone&lt;br /&gt;-Sensitive, fair-skinned&lt;br /&gt;-Not tolerant of fragrances, or products like Aveeno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long way... it should be considering they only give you 2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;-My face doesn&#x27;t feel clogged &amp; it really lathers out nicely -- overall it seems to absorb well&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your face and neck nice &amp; smooth the next day -- I noticed a better \\&quot;glow\\&quot; after two days of use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not really a fan of the smell -- it smells a bit like lemon grass  *This did not bother my skin, though.&lt;br /&gt;-No unscented version available&lt;br /&gt;-Very small amount for the money you pay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep purchasing this.... it seems like it will last me awhile.</li>
</ol>
