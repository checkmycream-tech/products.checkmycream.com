      <li>My hair didn&#x27;t really grow, but this made it feel healthy and smell good.</li>
      <li>It was a cheap enough product in regards to hair care and between all the products I was planning on buying this seemed like the best option.</li>
      <li>Super excited to see what it does!!</li>
      <li>It has a nice, fresh scent also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are familiar with Angel by Thierry MUGLER, this is the smell:)</li>
      <li>It really does repair your hair, making it nice and healthy.</li>
      <li>My hair is brittle and breaks off easily.</li>
      <li>And even though, no, my hair did not grow OVERNIGHT, this product made my hair so healthy, so clean and not tangled that this was the result.</li>
      <li>/&gt;some say the smell is too strong</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>I still use this product even though I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in hair growth because I have some faith that maybe one day my hair follicles will say \\&quot;fine, Justine</li>
      <li>Hair was very soft and silky!&lt;br /&gt;- Smelled good.</li>
      <li>Smells great and makes my hair super soft.  </li>
      <li>It smells like a vat of cheap perfume, and the smell doesn&#x27;t fade after you rinse and condition your hair.</li>
      <li>And this is a genuine review.</li>
      <li>not only does it smell great</li>
      <li>but it made it soft and smelling good</li>
      <li>It did however smell good and make my hair soft.</li>
      <li>It does go fast, so I would recommend ordering more than one if you plan on using it for more than a month.</li>
      <li>but it made my hair fall out more than normal !!!</li>
      <li>for the smell and how silky it makes my hair, it&#x27;s well worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>First, I LOVE the smell of this.  </li>
      <li>I never thought my hair could look this pretty, I am seriously in love with this stuff</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m female but love this kind of smell.  </li>
      <li>I feel like im on the road to long healthy hair!!</li>
      <li>The pleasant odor  of the cream s good but not good for the type of hair i have.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s different and kind of smells like a soap I would find at Whole Foods, but I&#x27;m okay with it!</li>
      <li>It smells really nice, it made my hair really soft.</li>
      <li>not only does it smell really good</li>

      <li>/&gt;i&#x27;m a LOYAL Wen user</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;First off, it is thick and gorgeous, and smells absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>Okay so I bought this product because, like most of us, I googled &amp;#34;best hair growth treatment&amp;#34; and reads the reviews to find myself choosing overnight shipping in such excitement.</li>
      <li>However, I noticed a huge difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>but it honestly feels healthy for thr first time in a long time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t handle the horrible smell...really wanted to love this product and ignore the scent but it was too gross</li>
    <li> My sister bought this for me since I had damaged hair in the front and it was really short that I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it, if I straighten it I would have to wear a bandana. So my sister bought this for me and in two weeks I saw progress in my hair. This was the best product I&#x27;ve ever use. If your loosing hair I recommend it. Left my hair super shiny and smooth. It&#x27;s god in a pink container no lie. Worth the money, do as it say and it does work. And it&#x27;s smells really good. I used every bit that I can. Awesome awesome,</li>
    <li> Just received today! Smells great! Super excited to see what it does!! I will write back and give an update in a month! Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> Bought this stuff on a whim after cutting a couple of inches off of my hair.. After using for 2 weeks, washing every day my hair has grown at least a half of an inch. Leaves your hair smelling great as well. I wash every day so this only lasted a couple of weeks...would recommend</li>
    <li> Only been using for about a week. Noticed improvement on the 1st day of use! Been noticing some growth as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About My Hair:&lt;br /&gt;- I got a perm which ruined my hair trying to grow it out&lt;br /&gt;- Natural Hair: Wavy, Shiny, Silky, Oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;- Hair was very soft and silky!&lt;br /&gt;- Smelled good. Yes, it has a VERY STRONG smell. I would not consider it a bad smell, it just smells masculine.&lt;br /&gt;- Hair is in better condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;- Small Bottles&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive&lt;br /&gt;- Too long to ship&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Products Using:&lt;br /&gt;- Lee Stafford Hair Growth Shampoo With Pro Growth Complex 200ml&lt;br /&gt;- Lee Stafford Hair Growth Treatment. 200ml&lt;br /&gt;- CHI Nourish Intense Hydrating Silk Bath Hair Shampoo (On occasion)&lt;br /&gt;- Jamaican Black Castor Oi</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft and helps with my hair fall out.</li>
    <li> Always had a problem growing out my hair. Its so dry plus i blow dry and straighten everyday. Been using this for about a month. I wouldn&#x27;t say its grown faster then usual but it honestly feels healthy for thr first time in a long time. I feel like im on the road to long healthy hair!!</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this product because, like most of us, I googled &amp;#34;best hair growth treatment&amp;#34; and reads the reviews to find myself choosing overnight shipping in such excitement. I have the kind of hair that grows to shoulder length and then takes years to grow beyond that. I used this product once and the next day, I was picking up my boyfriend from work and the first thing he says when he gets in the car is &amp;#34;whoa, your hair is getting so long!&amp;#34; And even though, no, my hair did not grow OVERNIGHT, this product made my hair so healthy, so clean and not tangled that this was the result. I can feel the difference in all ways. It&#x27;s softer, it&#x27;s healthier, it doesn&#x27;t get oily and it feels like it did when I was younger and my hair would grow at a rapid speed. I&#x27;ll write an updated review in a few weeks but as for now, I can tell that my hair is set up to grow as well as it should.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and the smell is pretty bad.</li>
    <li> I think this made a difference. I use it between shampoo and conditioner as directed and my hair feels thicker. I wish it came in a bigger size. They tell you to apply &amp;#34;the size of an egg&amp;#34; to your hair (I don&#x27;t use quite that much as my hair isn&#x27;t that long right now) but it still goes fast. I might buy it one more time.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in other reviews the smell is strong. Smells kind of like old man cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used as recommended by the container and this product gave me so much dandruff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does make your hair soft. Id personally just use conditioner if I wanted only soft hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Great smell, great conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it actually makes my hair grow (or stronger for growth) because I combine this with FAST shampoo and biotin pills.&lt;br /&gt;But for the smell and how silky it makes my hair, it&#x27;s well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Pretty much the title says it all. This stuff makes my hair soft, bouncy, and moist.. That&#x27;s even before i put in conditioner. This smell  doesn&#x27;t bother me much, I&#x27;m mixed so my hair is cruel joke by the gods. Its thick, with pretty much every combination of hair type known to man. Straight, wavy, curly,ringlets, kinky and to top it all off its shrinks when dry, however this stuff seems to help make hair  uniformed in looser curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a month (with the recommended shampoo and conditioner) so far and i&#x27;ve seen my hair grow pretty much about the same but healthier. I just wished this came in bigger jars since i&#x27;m almost out of this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after massive unexplained hair loss.  I was desperate and willing to try anything.  Prior to my hair loss, I&#x27;d always had trouble growing my hair past my shoulders due to breakage, but my most immediate need was to minimize the ongoing freaskish volume of hair loss each time I took a shower.  I&#x27;ve been using this maybe 4 months, every other time I wash my hair - so maybe 2-3x/week.  First, I LOVE the smell of this.  Other reviewers seemed mixed on the scent but I love it - smells masculine and earthy like men&#x27;s deoderant.  I&#x27;m female but love this kind of smell.  Someone else said &amp;#34;old lady perfume,&amp;#34; which I didn&#x27;t get at all.  Anyway, the scent seems to disappear the minute I hop out of the shower, so if it bugs you, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll notice it beyond the time it&#x27;s on your hair.  This stuff makes my hair so soft.  I use conditioner after but only need the tiniest bit.  As for it&#x27;s efficacy, unfortuately it&#x27;s really hard for me to say.  I think I&#x27;ve learned my hair loss is related to an iron deficciency.  I upped my iron intake after starting with this treatment, and am still losing crazy amounts of hair.  However, I have an insane amount of new hair growth and it seems to be growing more quickly, without much breakage.  I can&#x27;t say for sure if it&#x27;s this product or the iron - or something else entirely, but I just bought my second tub of this.  Smells great and makes my hair super soft.  And if there&#x27;s a chance it&#x27;s making my hair thicker and grow a bit faster too, that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it every other wash, so my hair doesn&#x27;t get brittle or fall out from too much protein (I&#x27;ve read that too much isn&#x27;t good for hair), and because I definitely don&#x27;t want to use it all up in a short amount of time because it&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to other products I use.&lt;br /&gt;People said it smelled lovely, so I was excited to smell it. When I did, I almost couldn&#x27;t believe what I was smelling. It smells like a cheap old woman&#x27;s perfume. It&#x27;s not something I would ever want to smell like. I was almost positive my boyfriend was going to cringe when he smelled my hair, but the smell actually reminded him of his aunt. So, that&#x27;s good, right?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. Other than the smell, the product works fine. I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks and my hair has grown about half an inch. I wear it in a ponytail every day, as well, just to help. :)&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this to anyone. But be aware what you&#x27;re going to smell like.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel super soft but I think it needs to be used continuously to see results. I only used one tub so I don&#x27;t think my hair grew any faster.</li>
    <li> it did make my hair feel soft, but it reeks. It smells like a vat of cheap perfume, and the smell doesn&#x27;t fade after you rinse and condition your hair. It gave me such a bad headache, I had to rewash my hair twice to get the smell out, thus negating any actual good it may have done.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing. not only does it smell great but it totally brought my hair back from the dead. the shipping time was so fast, it arrived within three days. i&#x27;m on my fourth batch now because i&#x27;m so addicted!</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly even though it came from UK, very impressed. I love this product! I use this every time I wash my hair and just use the instead of conditioner. This product makes my hair feel wonderful and I will definitely buy again! Just a short note: the actual item is quite large (larger than I expected from Amazon&#x27;s photo). Recommend!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell! Sometimes when I use it, I use it for the smell only and totally disregard what&#x27;s it suppose to do to my hair, HA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Hard to say... but it does seem to make my hair healthier so this would mean less breakage&#x3D; hair doesn&#x27;t get shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a week for it be delivered to me but its being shipped from outside the US so I didn&#x27;t mind. I bought it from Amazon since it was out of stock on ULTA for the longest time and it still got to me before ULTA got more stock in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted me a few months. I use it once or twice per week on my scalp only.</li>
    <li> Seriously, Amazing. Before this stuff, my hair, I swear, would not grow passed a certain length and I was searching for something to help and ran across this stuff. I purchased 2 containers and all I can say is &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34; It does what it says, My hair, has stopped falling out. I literally have nothing in my bottom drain anymore when I shower. I am also taking Viviscal which can also be helping the hair loss but this stuff is making my hair (namely the back of the crown area grow!! I am now on my 3rd container and this is going to be in my hair regimen for life. I am so happy. While I don&#x27;t notice it making it softer and shinier like the other reviewers&#x27; I found it got my hair to start growing past the point that it just wasn&#x27;t passing. I apply it just like the directions say.  If you are on the fence about this stuff. I am telling you....... Splurge. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Obviously you&#x27;re not going to get results over night, but my hair has always gotten to the same length (a little past my shoulders) and would stop. after using this for a little over a month, I can definitely tell that my hair is actually growing!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy like some leave-ins&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only halfway throught my first container and I use it every wash (2-4 days)&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it, but I suggest getting it at Ulta. It&#x27;s $11 there, no shipping, and of course they always have 20% off or $3.50 off coupons online :)</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well. I am very blonde and this really helps fortify dry damaged hair. Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it. It leaves my hair feeling soft, bouncy and much fuller.  Excellent product.  I need to order another container.</li>
    <li> it made my hair really soft, but if you are looking for hair growth this product didn&#x27;t do its job</li>
    <li> havent seen a difference yet</li>
    <li> Maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t in bad enough shape to really notice a difference? This just really didn&#x27;t seem like it did anything above and beyond any other protein deep conditioner. Didn&#x27;t detangle very well.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for my natural hair after a wash. Helps detangle and soften even before conditioning &amp; has lessened my hair shedding. My hair grew 2.5 inches in 40 days. Will definitely keep using!</li>
    <li> You defiantly have to use a conditioner with this because I feel like it made my hair almost like straw.  Yet, I did manage to grow my hair with also using other things. I wont buy this again though cause to me it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> Scent it&#x27;s pleasant, have noticed a little growth after 4 months</li>
    <li> loooooooove it ! . My hair was very damaged and short I swear its grown a little tiny bit and feels amazing will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> This is such a super miracle not only did it bring my hair more shine but my hair is falling out less and is definitely getting longer! You can buy it at ulta for cheaper though</li>
    <li> This product really works well! When I was using it, my hair grew an inch in a month and I would only use it sometimes. Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it, over the month and a half my hair has only grown half an inch. That really showed how well this product works!</li>
    <li> It actually works if you use it how your suppose to</li>
    <li> I love this product! a must have if you want to grow out your hair!&lt;br /&gt;some say the smell is too strong but I love how it smells!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every time I shower and my hair grows about 1.5 in. - 2 in. a month!</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t really grow, but this made it feel healthy and smell good.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because of two things, the price and the worth of the item. It was a cheap enough product in regards to hair care and between all the products I was planning on buying this seemed like the best option. And also it has been doing wonders on my head. haha I would recommend this to all who ask me about it!</li>
    <li> It smells really nice, it made my hair really soft. I let my hair air dry and it had so much body.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make my hair grow but it made it soft and smelling good</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really make hair soft. But smells great.. I&#x27;ll continue for now</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all in the title. It really does repair your hair, making it nice and healthy. As for the smell...I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s different and kind of smells like a soap I would find at Whole Foods, but I&#x27;m okay with it! I still use this product even though I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in hair growth because I have some faith that maybe one day my hair follicles will say \\&quot;fine, Justine, I know how much you want to love this product, so I&#x27;ll go ahead and grow 2 inches this month.\\&quot; I&#x27;d say buy it, man.</li>
    <li> Really conditions your hair, think it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far so I cannot say it has made my hair grow. However, I noticed a huge difference after the first use. My hair felt and looked more healthy and soft than usual. I love it. I will continue to use the product and hopefully see some results with making my hair healthy so it can grow.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little overwhelming, but after a few uses my hair was really soft. It does go fast, so I would recommend ordering more than one if you plan on using it for more than a month.</li>
    <li> this product does make a difference for your hair. not only does it smell really good but youll notice after only one use how much healthier your hair feels. it goes fast though so i would suggest buying two at a time.</li>
    <li> Not sure I&#x27;m going to get past the smell. Not pleasant at all;(  ive only used once so far I sure hope the smell goes away before morning!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...&lt;br /&gt;First off, it is thick and gorgeous, and smells absolutely amazing. I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint what the smell is, but it stays on your hair all day, and not in a bad way. It isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. My hair is very course, long, and there&#x27;s a lot of it. I didn&#x27;t need thickness by any means, but for people with thin hair, I am positive it will thicken up while using this.&lt;br /&gt;I first started using this product last winter, when my hair was a little past shoulder length. Hair tends to need a little extra nourishment in the ends and scalp during the winter, so this hair growth treatment helped a lot. I would recommend to first massage it into your scalp for a few minutes. This helps blood flow, stimulates the scalp, and frees hair follicles to maximize hair growth. This stuff is so yummy that you&#x27;re going to want to saturate all of your hair with it! Please, only saturate it once a week...you ARE going to want to do that EVERY DAY. Just keep in mind that the tub isn&#x27;t huge, and the product will go fast. I do wish it was in a bigger container, but that&#x27;s my only complaint. This product singlehandedly made my hair grow six inches since I started using it! LIFESAVER &lt;3</li>
    <li> It is okay.hair fells slim after I cast, skin fells tight, but do not have big effect after tun out.</li>
    <li> The pleasant odor  of the cream s good but not good for the type of hair i have. it dried up and make my hair brittle. so I just give it a 3 star.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have very fine, slow-growing hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now and it&#x27;s the longest it&#x27;s ever been.  On average, it&#x27;s grown about 3/4 in. a month.  For me, that&#x27;s a lot.  I&#x27;m very pleased and won&#x27;t stop using this product unless they stop making it!!  I only wish they made a larger jar, since you use quite a bit each time.  It has a nice, fresh scent also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason though, it took a long time for this product to be delivered and it was a little melted when it got here.  I&#x27;ve since located it in a store nearby and the texture was much better.  I&#x27;ll probably purchase it there instead of online from now on.</li>
    <li> i havent seen any growth  but i like how soft my hair feels, and the nice spell. still waiting on results</li>
    <li> Expensive, as it&#x27;s imported from England, but good stuff!</li>
    <li> For the product: Smell like angel from Thierry Mugler. The smell is overpowering. It leaves my hair soft but not much more.&lt;br /&gt;For the seller: shipping very fast</li>
    <li> I used this for a month my hair was very soft after treatment but it made my hair fall out more than normal !!! I did not see any growth</li>
    <li> Excellent product, smell great and leave hair super shiny! I don&#x27;t know about the growing part but it does make your hair smell amazing.</li>
    <li> Dont except sudden results. This isn&#x27;t just going to grow ten inches on your hair in a month. Nothing can do that. BUT WHAT IT DOES DO is... it gets your hair into a healthy state, so it won&#x27;t break off and it will reach its maximum potential length. I love it as a deep conditioner. It really adds health to your hair without weighing it down. Got my hair in the healthiest condition it has ever been in. I adore this product and would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> nice product it does work ive seen a change in my hair and its a flowery scent i dont mind it  . natasha</li>
    <li> My daughter has used this or months and is very happy with her results. This leaves her hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product, but it makes my hair feel nice.</li>
    <li> I just started using this a couple of weeks ago. I can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s working or not .</li>
    <li> Because of the weather- it being so cold- the cream had separated and was watery and then gritty when I received it.  I love this product but when shipping in extreme weather that could change the composition of the cream it should be shipped with precautions in preventing that from happening.</li>
    <li> My hair used to break and it was very unhealthy. After my first use, my hair felt healthy and soft. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is getting longer and I didn&#x27;t think it would work so fast. After two weeks though my hair has grown. I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that could make my hair grow. But this stuff really did work.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Granted, while it says to use it every time you wash your hair, I use it only when I remember to. I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and my hair has grown an inch (but I&#x27;ve also been taking Biotin daily). Nevertheless, I love this stuff. Would have given it 5 stars if it came in a larger container because it runs out really fast.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product for the second time. It makes your hair very soft and manageable, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. It is a portein treatment, I assume that is why you have to use a conditioner after. I would definitely recommend this product for fine and over processed hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, but I do like it. It leaves my hair soft and manageable. I can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s helping my hair grow or not, but there are overwhelming good reviews for growth on the Ulta site. The only thing is that it has a VERY strong smell. It kind of smells like cologne my grandparents might wear. The first time I used it, the smell stuck in my hair til my next wash. But I think the pros so far outweigh the cons. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> this smells amazing &amp; feels amazing in my hair. not sure if it made my hair grow longer faster but i&#x27;m still in love with it.</li>
    <li> IT DIDN&#x27;T LAST, hardly any for the price and it didn&#x27;t help the length. It did however smell good and make my hair soft.</li>
    <li> It really works!! Delivered on time and as expected. Cheaper than Ulta, which is almost always out of stock on this.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft, light, and shiny. Normally my hair is very thin, limp, and brittle, but now it has volume and the brush glides right through my hair instead of snagging on tangles. This is hands down the best conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve ever used and I will definitely be buying again. I don&#x27;t know that it has made my hair grow, but it is making my hair and scalp healthy. I am guessing my hair will be growing better now that it is properly hydrated. It says to leave it on for 5 minutes, but I usually wear it in a shower cap on my head for up to a few hours.(as long as possible) I get better results that way. I never thought my hair could look this pretty, I am seriously in love with this stuff</li>
    <li> I honestly believe this sped up my hair growth by about 50%.  I&#x27;m not sure how this stuff works, but really who cares as long as it does!</li>
    <li> I feel like it really helps! this is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered it...&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that the pot didn&#x27;t last that long, it took longer for it to be shipped to me then it did to get through the pot.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is the plus factor. If you are familiar with Angel by Thierry MUGLER, this is the smell:) I love the texture and it does the job well . The only reason I don&#x27;t given it 5 stars is because I have very long and the jar Goes away very fast!</li>
    <li> made my hair soft and smell very good but i lost alot of my hair rinsing it out. dont know if that&#x27;s because of the product or not</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t necessarily make UR hair grow but does provide hair feelig and looking healthier</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews... But I felt this product deserved it. I bought this product at ulta (which is less expensive) a few days ago and have only used it twice. I could feel and see a difference in my hair immediately. I have relatively normal relaxed hair. However, due to over processing (I color my hair about 4 times a year... If not more) and constant use of heat products... My hair is brittle and breaks off easily. I have a really hard time growing my hair out. It&#x27;s been about the same length for approximately 8 years (ahhhh! Not cool). It grows just past my shoulders... Then it stops. And it&#x27;s been this length for as long as I can remember. I constantly dream of long, beautiful locks of hair. However, even with the use of deep conditioners, oil treatments, and trims every other month or so... My hair just will NOT grow. I&#x27;m constantly on the look out for products and treatments and oils and such that claim to grow hair. I used to take a plethora of vitamins just because I thought it&#x27;d help my hair grow. Anyway, I recently googled &amp;#34;best products for hair growth&amp;#34; and this product was the first thing to pop up. I trusted google and the reviews and went to Ulta and bought 2 bottles. After the first use, I felt and saw a difference. My hair was sooooo soft and sooooo manageable. I straightened my hair that day (nothing out of the ordinary for me) and the softness lasted all day. Normally when I straighten my hair... After awhile it gets tangled and unmanageable and I end up putting it in a pony tail. Not that day. I wore my hair down all day and was proud to show off my soft and shiny hair. As I said, I&#x27;ve only used this product twice.. So it&#x27;s a little early to tell its full affect. But I can say, so far I am impressed. And I will continue to use the product. Hopefully it does what it claims and helps my hair grow. However if it doesn&#x27;t, I will still be satisfied with the fact that it makes my hair feel amazing. I would recommend this product to others. The only negative thing I have to say really is I don&#x27;t really care for the smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering... It&#x27;s just not very pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t fade. Other than that, I truly am pleased with this product. I will also add that this is not a fake review. I am an average person and consumer. And this is a genuine review.</li>
    <li> My hair has grown like crazy! I use this and the &amp;#34;not your mothers&amp;#34; brand for hair growth and its unbelievable! Definitely reccommend. Came very quickly too!</li>
    <li> this product leave your hair feeling SO soft it&#x27;s amazing. only used it once so far, so i&#x27;m not sure about the growth rate increase yet. smells so yummy and it&#x27;s indulgent as you massage it into your hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just ordered two more! and the hair growth conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m a LOYAL Wen user so i wouldn&#x27;t consider buying the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;(friends don&#x27;t let friends use shampoo ... USE WEN .. for real,  and no they aren&#x27;t paying me to say that LOL .. i wish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy growing</li>
