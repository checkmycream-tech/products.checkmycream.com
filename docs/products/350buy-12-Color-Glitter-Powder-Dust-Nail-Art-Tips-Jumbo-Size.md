<li> Other then that the colors I received weren&#x27;t exactly as shown in the picture</li>
<li> My only product was all the containers were half or less filled.</li>
<li> I got black, navy blue, baby blue, fuscia, neon orange, peach orange, red, hot pink, purple, white glitter, neon green and emerald.</li>
<li> Blue, Neon Green, Dark Green, Neon Yellow, Hot Pink, Gold, Silver, Majenta, White, Red, Orange and Purple.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Took a long time to get it.</li>
<li> and once it did about 4 glitters were open and the package was a mess.</li>
<li> the picture the only ones I didn&#x27;t get were, teal, black and the lighter shade of pink.</li>
<li> I expected bigger jars and received little jars.</li>
<li> but they just fill in half.</li>
<li> In place of those I received 2 shades of green and orange.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money...opened and glitter everywhere.  </li>
<li> Too small</li>
<li> Really small though.</li>
<li> Just a sloppy mess</li>
<li> disappointed I didn&#x27;t get white or silver.</li>
<li> Misleading at the very least.</li>
<li> only gave the product 4  stars because I was disappointed I didn&#x27;t get the Teal like color, and slightly disappointed I didn&#x27;t get the black either,</li>
<li> so ill start off my saying..</li>
<li> I will not purchase these again :(</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nice product,  good volume,  packaging may need some looking into but overall I will order Again</li>
    <li> The containers are tiny! and the box was full of dust cause the containers leaked. I will not purchase these again :(</li>
    <li> Great colors.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> Too small and i got 3 pinks😏</li>
    <li> I just purchased these and I am surprisingly very pleased. It took about a week and a few days to arrive (much sooner than originally quoted). A note to be mentioned: If you want to do acrylic glitter nails - You mix the glitter with clear acrylic powder before applying with liquid acrylic to your nails. FYI - the colors in the picture were not what I received but they were even better (in my opinion). I got black, navy blue, baby blue, fuscia, neon orange, peach orange, red, hot pink, purple, white glitter, neon green and emerald. All glittery and amazing. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Perfect to add a little sparkinl to my eyes! Arrived on time</li>
    <li> The product came in great condition, no glitter spilled, no duplicate colors, I didn&#x27;t receive the colors in the picture, though what I got were all nice colors (But I really wanted the first one in the second row, teal like.) I did however receive: Blue, Neon Green, Dark Green, Neon Yellow, Hot Pink, Gold, Silver, Majenta, White, Red, Orange and Purple.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave the product 4  stars because I was disappointed I didn&#x27;t get the Teal like color, and slightly disappointed I didn&#x27;t get the black either, but all in all the product was great, shipping was decent, about 3 weeks. I would recommend purchasing if you&#x27;re not specific on the colors you would like to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****In the picture the only ones I didn&#x27;t get were, teal, black and the lighter shade of pink. In place of those I received 2 shades of green and orange.</li>
    <li> The glitter color was great, its glitter dust just like i wanted but I did not like that it took forever to arrive and once it did about 4 glitters were open and the package was a mess. Just a sloppy mess</li>
    <li> Once the sellers read my review they made it perfect and replaced the items.  I have to say that the product is good but the shipping left something to be desired.  Once I got the new product and the containers were intact I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;The sellers are what had made a huge difference and if you have any problems just get a hold of them and they will make you whole.</li>
    <li> It was well sealed, no spills or leakage.  I loved the colors and very fine sparkles.  It also came very quickly. I will order again without hesitation!</li>
    <li> yes I have got it ,BUT! I order it because of white dust ,as you see it is on picture but there was no White in the package</li>
    <li> Definitely not jumbo size. Other then that the colors I received weren&#x27;t exactly as shown in the picture but u get more then most . The jars are 1inch in height and width .</li>
    <li> I receive the delivery on the last day of the estimated time. The product was not jumbo size at all. Misleading at the very least. I expected bigger jars and received little jars. The colors are gorgeous though.</li>
    <li> I love this glitter it is so pretty</li>
    <li> I like the glitter and perfect price and the size too</li>
    <li> This is really pretty and a great product every shinning your nails and toes ladies this is the real thing and a lot of shimmer</li>
    <li> I wanted glitter for toes and i got lots of glitter and i love the colors they look so pretty and yes i would order again if i need more</li>
    <li> so ill start off my saying..this is just glitter..you cant expect it to be tammy taylor..all you need is to mix it with some clear acrylic and theyre great acrylics! you can use it in many ways. i did not get all the colors in the pictures but i am still happy with the ones i recieved..yes there was alittle glitter in the box it comes with...theyre in plastic containers shipping from china so thats bound to happen. all in all im very happy with them and im new at doing my own nails. def will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Really wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. Thought you could sculpt with this. Fun to decorate with though.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get it. When I did get it, 3 of them were open and all over. Lost about 80% of one color. Will not buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I love this product, if you like glitter this is for you, they are beautiful glitters that have so many uses!</li>
    <li> Arrived within its time frame. My only product was all the containers were half or less filled. But the little that I did get were beautiful.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money...opened and glitter everywhere.  Custom form said phone case inside.....hum</li>
    <li> same thing, showing jumbo but they just fill in half.</li>
    <li> not so good ....they spill</li>
    <li> It is ok. most of theme were not well closed. But is not a bad product. Really small though.</li>
    <li> disappointed I didn&#x27;t get white or silver. they are pretty tho, haven&#x27;t tried them yet. but I wish I would have got the colors I thought I was going to get.</li>
    <li> Just received these today. Very disappointed. Not glitter at all. It is matte colored powder. That&#x27;s it. I would have never ordered this if I knew it wasn&#x27;t actually glittery.</li>
