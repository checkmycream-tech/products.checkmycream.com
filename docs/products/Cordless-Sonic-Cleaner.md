      <li>Love it, it&#x27;s perfect</li>

      <li>It is probably a good product</li>

      <li>and it seems to do a good job.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as I thought it would be. ...</li>
      <li>Not as good as I would like</li>
      <li>best way I&#x27;ve found to clean them (of course we each have our own).</li>
      <li>She is very pleased with the gift.</li>
      <li>Works great and does not shake off my table like most people say.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I think we change the batteries once a month, after using it most every day!</li>
      <li>tablets work great by themselves, but the cordless Sonic Cleaner is cheap.  </li>
      <li>The water container just slides out and their is no water seal of any kind.</li>
      <li>My husband uses this for his dentures.&lt;br /&gt;Although the &amp;#34;vibrating cleaning effect&amp;#34; is a nice feature, he does not use that that feature; he just uses it for a container to soak his dentures overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is perfect to fit my daughters retainer, instead of trying to find a cup to fit it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cost effective.</li>
      <li>I am happy that I have this to clean my retainers.</li>
      <li>but I have found that it is great to use for a quick 3 minute cleaning.  </li>
      <li>My orthodontia was done in my 60s; for this Golden Girl, keeping my retainers clean is now a joy!  </li>
      <li>intend to call the orthodontist to see if it is a good thing for him to use to clean his retainer.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>but it is a good place to clean retainer.</li>
      <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it is.  </li>
      <li>This is very cheap made product.</li>
      <li>Great way to keep your retainers fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not sure if it works until I find out how to use it.</li>
      <li>Most sonic cleaners shut off after&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am sure there are better ones out there, but it does work for what I use it for.</li>
      <li>Works okay.</li>
      <li>Might be better spending your money on an ultrasonic cleaner instead...</li>
      <li>It cleans so much better than just brushing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am glad I am almost done with invisalign, hopefully the night time retainers won&#x27;t need sonic cleaning often.</li>
      <li>Good product and well worth the price.</li>
      <li>When I supplied them it worked OK</li>
      <li>Love this sonic cleaner.</li>
      <li>I wanted more vibration and because of the lack of I give it a 3.</li>
      <li>steep for 10 hours then shake and do it again for 10 more hours and it</li>
      <li>Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>AND THEN SOME:)</li>
      <li>In any case, it looks better than a kitchen cup on the bathroom counter for my son to put his retainers in when he is cleaning them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make more than a hum.</li>
      <li>the water does spill to the bottom of the unit (the top is sealed)</li>
      <li>but they love it as a gift.</li>
      <li>When I opened it up it seemed ok</li>
      <li>Better off just brushing dentures or cleaning retainers with a toothbrush.</li>
      <li>That said, I was relatively pleased.</li>
      <li>Thankfully I was able to get my retainers out.</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>This cordless sonic cleaner is great for cleaning my retainers and leaves them fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>It was good for maybe the first couple of months</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how good it would be since it is battery powered, but It really cleans my retainer well.</li>
      <li>and I see this becoming a problem.</li>
      <li>So far works great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is any better than using a plastic cup filled with denture cleaner.</li>
      <li>it really works good.</li>
      <li>I have nothing but great things to say about the product.i have not been able to purchase the sonic Cleaner locally</li>
      <li>THE UNIT IS QUITE COMPACT AND EASY TO USE.</li>
      <li>It could not get my aligners clean even after having it run for more than 15 mins.</li>
      <li>If the suction cup is installed on the counter top correctly keeps the device in place.&lt;br /&gt;3.Easy to clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>unit came intact, the box was fine and the instructions were included.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This unit is fine.</li>
      <li>Battery dies every quick!</li>
      <li>This makes so much sense for keeping dental appliances fresh and pleasant to (have to) use.  </li>
      <li>This little gadget is perfect for cleaning my retainer.  </li>
      <li>The battery operated portion of this was bizarre.  </li>
      <li>Built cheap.</li>
      <li>Cheap solution to a problem you didn&#x27;t know you had.</li>
      <li>This cordless sonic cleaner is made of cheap plastic - feels like it could break at any moment.  </li>
      <li>Cheap looking and came with no battery</li>
      <li>This unit will be just sufficient for disinfecting and superficial cleaning of a denture or dental appliance and maybe for light cleaning of jewelry, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I rated this four stars because it proved to be a very useful, neat product and was needed for retainers.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product.  When I got it, it was dirty, and had clearly been previously used.  The instructions were gone and the packaging was poor.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I put a tablet in and then the upper denture and then hot water.  I run it for about 15 minutes, shut it off and go to sleep.  I run it for 15 minutes in the morning, rinses it hot water and then put it in.  It works very well.  My companion has one as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for traveling.  It looks like just the right size.  I&#x27;m very happy with the performance too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product mainly to super sonic clean my dentures between dentist appointments but I have found that it is great to use for a quick 3 minute cleaning.  I haven&#x27;t tried to clean jewlery yet.  Not used as often as I thought I would use it though.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s so small yet does the trick.  I have lot&#x27;s of silver that always needs cleaning. This little machine is fast and no mess.  Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter had her braces removed and the orthodontist recommended that she clean/soak her retainer daily. My teenagers are always in a hurry and not known for being through, I thought this gadget might come in helpful in getting into the routine of keeping that expensive retainer clean. After a month, it is still working well and it seems to do a good job.  There is no timer on this model so you have to remember to turn it off after 15 minutes and it does \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; while in use but that&#x27;s not a big deal. $10.00 was worth the price even if it only lasts a year or two.</li>
    <li> Great travel sized vibrating denture cleaner. Regular denture tablets are fine. Built in timer, then dentures just continue soaking overnight. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> For the money it does as expected. I don&#x27;t understand why people rate stuff like this badly. They complain if its too expensive and they complain if its cheap. Where is the happy medium? Listen, I work as a IT and I see this becoming a problem. People do not know how to rate based on pricing. I can see if this product cost 40 and up then you would have a valid argument. Its only $6.00! You blow that much on your way to work or on part of your lunch. People grow up, it gets a little irritating to see complaints about cheap products. I guess you want it to pull your dentures out of your mouth to right? Yeah...then you&#x27;ll be complaining about how rough the device pulled it out. For $6.00 I wouldn&#x27;t advise you to buy a device that claim to pull your dentures out with ease. Not for no $6.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;I give it just one star because it actually worked for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned two of these actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works by vibrating so the first problem we had was it moves while vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;We left it unattended and found that it \\&quot;walked\\&quot; off the kitchen counter.&lt;br /&gt;So then we barricaded it in place.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to keep it dry because your putting a tub of water (and spit) on it.&lt;br /&gt;So then it started to rust inside.  It got pretty nasty in the battery compartment.&lt;br /&gt;Then it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unit number two...&lt;br /&gt;This one had all the same problems as the first one with one additional one.&lt;br /&gt;The thing was really noisy.&lt;br /&gt;We couldn&#x27;t take it and just dumped it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Now we just use a cup.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with. I wanted more vibration and because of the lack of I give it a 3.</li>
    <li> Pros:-&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleans the retainers fairly well when I add retainer brite and run it for 15 mins.&lt;br /&gt;2. If the suction cup is installed on the counter top correctly keeps the device in place.&lt;br /&gt;3.Easy to clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;4. No cords, lasts a month with each set of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:-&lt;br /&gt;1. Noisy&lt;br /&gt;2. battery compartment rusted after 3 months. I was careful to not get the bottom wet. But the humidity in the bathroom caused it to rust. I cannot think of keeping it any other place other than bathroom counter top to be convenient, but the rusting makes it hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I am almost done with invisalign, hopefully the night time retainers won&#x27;t need sonic cleaning often. If you live in less humid places might work for you.</li>
    <li> Works well...but a little noisier than the exact same models I have purchased in the past. I set it on a face cloth and that helps.</li>
    <li> Even with this Sonic Cleaner, I soak invisaligns and they still have a film!!!!  Very unhappy!  Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Eh. Any container will do. This is very cheap made product. Doubt it does anything. Just perfect size for retainers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really clean retainers...  Good for storing them with denture cleaner though.</li>
    <li> very happy with  the order just what i was looking for good job</li>
    <li> I used the Sonic Cleaner as soon as it arrived.  It worked so well and removed stains I had been trying to clean from my dentures for the last month.  A great buy</li>
    <li> I was actually shopping for a replacement for my hubby&#x27;s cleaner when I came across this one and had to leave a review. This is the one he got from our dentist when he got partials. It&#x27;s SUPER messy. You have to really careful or else you will make a huge mess because the container isn&#x27;t seated very well and easily splashes water around or even falls out completely. Maybe it&#x27;s because of all the water, but his rusted on the bottom where the battery goes in and you can&#x27;t turn it on anymore. It was good for maybe the first couple of months but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Does a good job cleaning, may have left my retainer in a bit too long (thought it was the correct time) but piece of plastic on retainer missing when I removed it the first time.</li>
    <li> I originally had this same exact cleaner when I got my dental appliance (for sleep apnea). It was part of the \\&quot;care system\\&quot; that came with the appliance. It went missing after a move so I bought this one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some warm to hot water in the cup and a denture tablet - 5 minutes later the device is minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a fairly useless suction cup on the bottom that may keep it from sliding around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there are better ones out there, but it does work for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> This cordless sonic cleaner is made of cheap plastic - feels like it could break at any moment.  Putting the batteries in was difficult - they did not fit well.  The on-off switch is very junky looking - not even the same color of plastic surrounds the on-off switch.  Looked like it was 5 years old.  And, surprise, it didn&#x27;t work when turned on.  Returned this item for a refund.</li>
    <li> It slightly vibrates from the bottom. Thats all. Not a strong vibration that you would get from a sonic tooth brush.  Not even close.  And its a bit loud.  The water container just slides out and their is no water seal of any kind. When its \\&quot;soaking\\&quot;, you have to be careful as to not to tip it over, even very slightly. Not worth the buy.</li>
    <li> The design is sloppy and cheap.  It is loud.  It is not very well protected from water so the user will need to be careful if they want this thing to last very long. There is a small suction cup on the bottom to hold it in place while it vibrates.    Note -- its made in China.   The box it came in was smashed up and dirty.  There are no instructions in my box -- I don&#x27;t know if it was supposed to come with instructions.  The device, when we took it out of the box, is also dirty.  The battery compartment is too small for the AA batteries it calls for -- did I mention it was made in China?    Miracle of miracle, it does work.  But it is just a very loud vibrator with a little plastic tub for the retainer/mouth guard.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money. It ended up in a trash can same day I got it. Thank got I did not bet hurt. Product came with no instructions or &amp;#34;included batteries&amp;#34; like box indicated. So I put some batteries in and place water in a dish and my retainer. As soon as I turned it on it started cracking and smoking and leaking battery acid. Thankfully I was able to get my retainers out.</li>
    <li> very good cleaner for the price</li>
    <li> Note: I purchased this Sonic Cleaner through Hottest Deal Ever \\&quot;HDE\\&quot; the One-Star rating is for them, not the item, and not for Amazon.    The Cordless Sonic Cleaner gets one star because the item was supposed to be new. Box is shelf worn, not factory sealed in anyway, and the item itself had muddy-ish hand prints on its exterior. The item was cheap enough that it did not make sense to send it back so after throughly disinfecting and cleaning the unit we tried it. It worked fine, though the On/Off button is very loose. It is being used on Invisaligns with the Retainer Bright tablets.    This is a good teen and/or travel unit and \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; we would purchase it again... just not from HDE.</li>
    <li> This unit is fine. It&#x27;s just that, when you drop in the cleaner tablet to soak the appliance in when you&#x27;re not wearing it, and you turn on the unit, the foaming you get can exceed the little tub if you&#x27;re not careful to fill it appropriately. My daughter took to just leaving it off, which then begs the question as to why have a battery-operated unit. We chose a more basic unit that doesn&#x27;t vibrate, and it works fine.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much a bottom-of-the-line cleaner.  You get what you pay for, though, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.  Really it is not much more than a holder for the water and tablets you buy.  I think the tablets do much of the work.  In any case, it looks better than a kitchen cup on the bathroom counter for my son to put his retainers in when he is cleaning them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cleaner to help keep my retainers clean.  After following the instructions, I could not tell any difference in the cleanliness of the retainers.  It is loud and very annoying.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  A huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> Happy because I am happy with my Cordless Sonic Cleaner purchase.My dentist suggested that I make the purchase because of the type of partial I had made (valplast). It does not have to soak overnight. place them in the cordless sonic cleaner for 15 minutes per cleaning.Now I am asking you do you have the cleaner for vaplast partial denture. If I need a Cordless Sonic Cleaner I will order from you. I have nothing but great things to say about the product.i have not been able to purchase the sonic Cleaner locally so I have to order on line. It prove to be a great purchase Amazon.com. Just call me Happy.</li>
    <li> This item did not provide directions. I tried contacting the seller and they did not respond on two separate occasions and emails. I finally called my dentist and requested information about sonic cleaning machines for dental appliances and received two different versions. I merged  their recommendation and use the sonic cleaner. I like the appliance because it is neat and compact.</li>
    <li> Works okay. Not as good as I thought it would be. ...but dose what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> No instructions included with the product which was delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon website also does not include instructions. Product box says &amp;#34;2AA&amp;#34; Batteries Included&amp;#34;, however, they were not included.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it works until I find out how to use it.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FITS MY NEEDS WELL AND AT A GREAT PRICE! I LOVE THAT AMAZON IS A ONE STOP PLACE TO FIND WHAT EVERY I NEED AT A GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> Not as good as I would like but it does help clean my dentures. I will keep using it for now.</li>
    <li> I use with my varplast partial.  it cleans and disinfects for daily use.  runs on batteries and can travel with me</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is a sonic cleaner. It has very vibration and didn&#x27;t clean my jewelry af all after 30 minutes</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0018FNUXU Cordless Sonic Cleaner]]  Unit is inexpensive and barely adequate.  Battery operated, cannot perform as well as the more expensive, more elaborate, 110V alternatives.  You get what you pay for.  This unit will be just sufficient for disinfecting and superficial cleaning of a denture or dental appliance and maybe for light cleaning of jewelry, but that&#x27;s about it.  Don&#x27;t expect it to remove heavy stain or deposits from either.</li>
    <li> The product packaging is severely worn and faded.  There is dust on the cleaner and there are no instructions or batteries as the clearly states there should be.  I don&#x27;t know how to contact the seller, but I want what I ordered.</li>
    <li> The product was never delivered to my house. I did receive a refund for the product, but not for the shipping charge. Don&#x27;t bother to order the product unless you want to throw money away.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews - so many negatives - but figured with the low price and the easy returns w/ Amazon Prime if it was truly junk, it was worth a try.  Now I&#x27;ve used it for a few months for my mouthguard, &amp; it works just fine, no problems.  The suction cup on the bottom keeps it from moving around.  It&#x27;s quiet.  It&#x27;s compact.  I throw in a tablet of Retainer Brite, and though I can&#x27;t really prove that it makes a difference, my mouthguard feels a little cleaner than before with un-sonic soaking.</li>
    <li> Seems to have long battery life.  Well constructed and does a good job.  Since the cleaning tabs turn the water blue and then turn to clear when cleaning is done it would be nice if the cup were clear instead of blue, but that&#x27;s really nit picking.  15 minutes and my herbst comes out looking great.</li>
    <li> It does the jog as advertised - loads cheaper than any place else - i would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> If I could give it ZERO STARS I would. Purchased new, it arrived with a broken on/off switch stuck in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position. The only way to start and stop it was to insert and remove the batteries.  I tried it on dental retainers and after 5 minutes it had cleaned nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Shipping it back costs as much as buying it so I just threw it out.  I then purchased a Chicago Electric Ultrasonic Cleaner that works perfectly and would get 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> 7 June 2012,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make this short and sweet.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  Built cheap. Nothing sonic about it.  Mild vibration.  If you see 5 stars on this product, it&#x27;s probably because they are coming from the people that sell them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tablets work great by themselves, but the cordless Sonic Cleaner is cheap.  So if you are buying this products because of the sonic clearer is added to the package like I did... you bubble will be busted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, buy the tablets seperately and search Amazon for sonic cleaner.  I am buying the \\&quot;DB-Tech Ultra Sonic Cleaner with a 17-ounce Stainless Steel Cleaning Tank, Jewelry Basket, Watch Holder, 3- Minute Cycle &amp; Auto Shut-off - Generates 42,000 Ultrasonic Energy Waves Per Second by DBTech\\&quot; for $29.00 using the Super Saver shipping.  It&#x27;s on page 4.  There are 2 like it for a little less and by different makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will leave a review after using the item.</li>
    <li> Excellent for cleaning my Invisalign retainers. When used with Retainer Brite all stains and odors are removed in just a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product - later than expected - not the worst thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the shipping box to find a faded very OLD looking box (Scraped up, dented, etc.) for the sonic cleaner. I found the cleaner inside without any type of protective covering that you would normally find on a product like this. There were NO instructions. The blue faded box the cleaner came in stated the batteries would be included - they were NOT. The on and off switch look used. The water cup was scratched up like someone had tried to remove the manufacturers sticker from the bottom of the cup. Overall - Not happy. I expected a new product and it seems obvious that I didn&#x27;t get one. I don&#x27;t know if it is just the seller trying to pull a fast one on me - and it looks like others as well.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Sonic Cleaner&amp;#34; is no better than just the standard denture cup you can buy at Walmart -- just a place to put the dentures while they soak in whatever cleaner you put in.  I had a sonic cleaner once before for my jewelry -- this is nothing like that.  This just vibrates a bit until you turn it off.  My dentures actually got cleaner in the standard cup because there was more room for them.  Made in China, of course. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> The cordless Sonic Denture Cleaner is inexpensive but it works great. Drop your dentures in, add whatever cleaning agent you prefer, flip the switch on and walk away. The only con is if you forget to come back and flip the switch back to the off position as I have done a couple of times it will run until the batteries die. No auto shut off. But what do you expect for $10.00. Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> The shaking is non-existent.  It just makes the noise with no shaking.  Because I have it, I will use it, but once it breaks, I am done with it and going back to cleaning my retainer the old fashion way....warm water in a clear cup with the retainer tablet cleaner.</li>
    <li> Not worth the few $&#x27;s I spent. The vibration serves no purpose.  I used the BRITE cleaning tablets and left this to run 5 minutes and found the tablet didn&#x27;t dissolve all the way through.  Basic cup does the same job.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I expected but deep enough to soak both invisiline type of retainers! we use with the cleaning tabs</li>
    <li> It could not get my aligners clean even after having it run for more than 15 mins. I&#x27;m very disappointed with the outcome. It took a while to arrive and has not been uo to scratch.</li>
    <li> we haven&#x27;t added the batteries for the sonic effect.  This is perfect to fit my daughters retainer, instead of trying to find a cup to fit it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughters retainer. She brushes them first and then uses this. She has not noticed a big difference in it before and after usage. It might be cleaning off tiny micro organisms-not sure. Not a total waste of money-but I don&#x27;t know that I would recommend it. I do like using the tablets that I bought with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in combination with the Retainer Brite tablets for the purpose of cleaning of my retainer and mouth guard.  It is an amazing! My retainer hasn&#x27;t felt this clean since it was brand new.  It took a little while to arrive but it was totally worth the wait.  The vibration sound can be a bit loud so I usually set it up in the bathroom while I&#x27;m doing other things in another room. The only flaw is that on occasion the suction cup doesn&#x27;t stick and the unit vibrates around the counter (one time it fell off).  But I easily resolved this by just setting it inside the sink while it&#x27;s on..no big deal. Regardless it&#x27;s totally worth it for the fresh clean feeling.</li>
    <li> This a tantamount to fraud - will not return, not worth the time and effort involved to do so, however, it would seem with all the other reviews (wish I had read) maybe the Better Business Bureau should be involved.</li>
    <li> Did the job I wanted it to do - and the price was great! Others I had looked at were much more expensive.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT ITEM !!!!!! WELL WORTH THE MONEY AND THEN SOME:) IT WAS SHIPPED FAST.</li>
    <li> My two teenagers used this daily after braces came off.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical but it works very well and keeps the retainer very clear</li>
    <li> Arrived dirty. Looks like it&#x27;s been on the store shelves for years. It says batteries included on the package, but there were none. Box was all dinged up. The product does work well on cleaning my Invisalign aligners.  So I will still give it three stars for the actual effectiveness of the product.</li>
    <li> This cordless sonic cleaner is great for cleaning my retainers and leaves them fresh and clean.  I use it all the time!</li>
    <li> RECEIVED SEPT. 3 , 2014  , SEPT. 16 , 2014  SOME TIMES IT WORK BARELY WHEN IT DOES WORK . IT WORK FOR 14 DAY</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son when he got his braces off and had a retainer. I also purchased the Retainer Brite tablets with this and the two items have really helped at keeping his retainer clean and clear of buildup. The sonic cleaner stays super clean and works really well. The only trick I would add to this is when you turn it on maybe have it sit on a towel or something a bit softer because on a hard countertop it vibrates and makes a very annoying sound and it tends to vibrate right OFF THE COUNTER! LOL!  But put it on a towel and you don&#x27;t hear it at all unless your right next to it and it stays in place. I was afraid that because it used batteries instead of plugged in we&#x27;d be going thru batteries like crazy, well that is NOT the case. The battery life is very LONG and I think we change the batteries once a month, after using it most every day! I&#x27;m very happy with that! When the retainer is done I&#x27;m going to try it for jewelry cleaning. I think it would work really well.&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this item I hope you are as happy with it as we have been. I have actually been very surprised at how well it works for being so small and compact. Perfect size for a retainer!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Cleaning!</li>
    <li> This little bad boy is amazing. I wasn&#x27;t sure how good it would be since it is battery powered, but It really cleans my retainer well.</li>
    <li> There was NO instructions as to how to use, do I put water in it or leave dry?</li>
    <li> Sucks. Does not even vibrate enough to clean anything.</li>
    <li> Productc didnt work the way I thought. Piece of cheap plastic and doesnt clean my retainer well. Shipped fast though and was what was advertised.</li>
    <li> Wears out pretty quickly with daily use.</li>
    <li> Works great and does not shake off my table like most people say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I steep my e-juice with this and let me tell you.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A GREAT LITTLE &amp;#34;CORDLESS SONIC CLEANER.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it shuts off when I want it too. Most sonic cleaners shut off after&lt;br /&gt;3 min. This little guy will run for a full day until I flip the switch on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I steep for 10 hours then shake and do it again for 10 more hours and it&lt;br /&gt;makes my e-juice taste like its been sitting for over 1 month!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST BUY IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Furious~</li>
    <li> Works great.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years.</li>
    <li> I have a retainer for use after braces were worn. I purchased this to clean the retainer along with some tablets used to bubble up and be used for cleaning things like dentures, and neither one of them worked. I have to clean the retainer like before with a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent purchase. I am happy that I have this to clean my retainers. Cordless helps when you are traveling. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help boost the cleaning power of Retainer Brite.  It is a small item,it worked for a while.  It developed a crack soon after I started using the item.  I think it was a flaw in the plastic.  It is probably a good product but I was unfortunate to get a lemon this time.  I will probably buy another one in the near future and give it another try. Amazon was good about giving me a refund for this flawed product.</li>
    <li> This thing is just a little blue plastic cup that sits on top of a vibrating bottom.  It has a little suction cup under it, you&#x27;re supposed to stick to the counter to keep it from walking around, but it doesn&#x27;t stick.  If you&#x27;re not careful, the whole thing will walk right off the counter and dump everything onto the floor.  Since you have to stand there and watch over it anyway, you might as well just clean everything manually.</li>
    <li> Your putting your helwery in a vibrating cup, doesnt do anything different than dropping it into a cup at home that wasnt vibrating</li>
    <li> The cordless sonic cleaner came without instruction. The back of the battery chamber will not stay on after inserting batteries. Does not clean. Would not buy or recomend.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;Cordless Sonic Cleaner&#x27; was a disappointment.  It basically just vibrates and does not do what I had anticipated - the missing word &#x27;UltraSonic&#x27; lead to my mistake in purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter thinks the cleaner is not necessary for my grandson&#x27;s retainer.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to call the orthodontist to see if it is a good thing for him to use to clean his retainer.&lt;br /&gt;In any case it was a good price and it arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use with a set of retainers. It works fine as a bath (the green plastic part separates from the base for easy cleaning), but I&#x27;m not sure how much benefit the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action is. It&#x27;s basically a tiny motor that vibrates the entire contraption, powered by two AA batteries. I have to put it on a towel to keep it from vibrating off the counter, despite the suction cup on the bottom. The packaging suggests this device could just as well have been picked up at a dollar store. That said, I was relatively pleased.</li>
    <li> Cheap looking and came with no battery</li>
    <li> It is fine , not sure about the sonic part but it is a good place to clean retainer.</li>
    <li> I am a semi professional macro photographer and take pictures of all kind of things with ultra close ups.  I saw this advertised and figured if it didn&#x27;t work, I would have only been out $4.00.  I wasn&#x27;t wrong about being out the four bucks.  I was impressed with the packaging the cleaner was sent in and again impressed to see that the box containing the cleaner was intact.  I took out the \\&quot;Sonic Cleaner\\&quot; and was looking for the cleaning agent and batteries as was advertised in the listing.  What I got was a removable plastic tub and the main unit.  It doesn&#x27;t operate on sonic waves.  It is a small unit with a motor inside that vibrates.  I put in a coin and water.  After five minutes, I took out the coin and it was the same.  If it sounds too good to be true, it is.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  You can do the same thing by dropping a coin into a glass of water.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because it was linked to the retainer cleaning tabs that I needed to purchase. The vibrating feature is pretty weak. It should not be sold with retainer cleaning tabs.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend to purchase its a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It was used for my son&#x27;s Invisalign and it stopped working within the first 3.5 weeks. Maybe cordless is not the way to go.</li>
    <li> Battery dies every quick!</li>
    <li> AA batteries were not included as promised. When I supplied them it worked OK I think. Not recommended</li>
    <li> i ordered this to clean retainer and it&#x27;s exactly what i ordered.  thank you so much.  it really works good.</li>
    <li> I,M SORRY I DIDNT GIVE IT 5 STARS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a year. It works well for me and my Invisaligns. There are some things to think about, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My unit came intact, the box was fine and the instructions were included.&lt;br /&gt;It does clean with the tablets. It also removes any odors and saliva, leaving the braces clean.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make more than a hum. I read reviews saying it&#x27;s noisy. My unit isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;There is a suction cup on the bottom which will hold it in place, if used.&lt;br /&gt;The top is sealed, so any water intrusion is only from the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The cup is held in place by the top, a rim and the tight fit of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only replaced the batteries 3 times. Keep in mind that though the unit only requires 15 minutes to clean, I have left it on for hours at times, when I forget it. I think the batteries last an exceptionally long time, so that if I&#x27;d use it only for 15 minutes a day, I would not have had to change the batteries at all during the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW THE NOT SO GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cup&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to lose the suction cup on the bottom while traveling (it isn&#x27;t a tight fit) and the unit will walk away. Easily fixed, either with a towel or a barricade or a new suction cup. I put mine between the wall and the sink. No problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water&lt;br /&gt;Care must be taken not to over-fill the cup. It&#x27;s shallow and the water is easily spilled when sliding the cup into place due to the tight fit. However, there is about 1/2 inch of space at the top of the cup, after the Invisaligns are covered, and while it requires some care, it&#x27;s not that hard to get the cup in without spilling the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the cup is held in place by the top, the rim and the tight fit of all, care is also needed to avoid jerking instead of sliding it out when the cleaning is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the water does spill to the bottom of the unit (the top is sealed) action is required to avoid all the rusting so many have complained about. It&#x27;s been almost a year since I have spilled the water, but I pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Auto Shut Off&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off. I set the unit while I eat breakfast, then go finish cleaning my teeth right after. The shut off is behind the unit and takes a little shuffling and care to turn it on and off without spilling the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECAP:&lt;br /&gt;I like this unit. It&#x27;s small so it doesn&#x27;t take much space. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, even if it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;sonic\\&quot;, whatever that is. It distributes the cleaner with the vibration and cleans my Invisaligns. It&#x27;s cost effective. Both the unit and the cup have a substanial feel. After a year, the unit still looks new. However, it can be tricky when filling or emptying the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems people have with it are mostly with the manufacturer/vendor supplying the unit or their failure to take remedial action when playing with the water.</li>
    <li> This first one I bought lasted two years. I just bought my second one.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for someonelse but they love it as a gift. Cleanse well.  A time saver for this person.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this machine,and uses it everyday, he would not use anything else for denture cleaning, it is small and easy to take along on trips too!</li>
    <li> This cleaner seems a bit pointless. The vibration doesn&#x27;t seem to move fast enough to &amp;#34;sonic clean&amp;#34;. Definitely need to use with additional cleaning agent. Better off just brushing dentures or cleaning retainers with a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleaner for my night guard and take it on trips because it is cordless and small enough to take in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly &amp; as described.  My daughter didn&#x27;t like wearing her retainer each night without cleaning it (can&#x27;t say I blame her) and this is a low cost &amp; effective solution.  So far works great.</li>
    <li> THIS UNIT CLEANS MY TEETH STRAGHTENING RETAINERS, BY GETTING INTO THE CREVICES,  CLEANING THE PLATES VERY WELL.  THE UNIT IS QUITE COMPACT AND EASY TO USE.</li>
    <li> Our orthodontist gave us this to clean my daughter&#x27;s aligners.  It works so well that I purchased a second one through here to have in case the one they gave us stops working.  It cleans so much better than just brushing.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this for his dentures.&lt;br /&gt;Although the &amp;#34;vibrating cleaning effect&amp;#34; is a nice feature, he does not use that that feature; he just uses it for a container to soak his dentures overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it looks more attractive on our bathroom counter than the other cheap plastic, generic ones.&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd one of these that I have purchased for him.</li>
    <li> Use this with my new upper immediate partial and the fixodent whitening tablets for 30 minutes a day to save time.  Just be warned it does move across the surface it sits on and will fall off your counter unless you set it on a towel</li>
    <li> I am not really completely happy with this item.  The container is not big enough and then runs over.  Needless to say then the batteries rust and it leaves rust on the countertop.</li>
    <li> I use this only as a cup for cleaning. The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; part is junk vibration which is noisy and ineffective. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is any better than using a plastic cup filled with denture cleaner. It just vibrates on a very low speed like one of those hand held massagers. Might be better spending your money on an ultrasonic cleaner instead...</li>
    <li> When my daughter needed something to help keep her retainer clean, this was it.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money. too late to return so i am throwing it away. doesnt perform as described and left rust marks on the countertop where it was kept. DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> works best when first turned on, battery wears out fast - it slows down and cleans not as good when its running more than a very short time.</li>
    <li> This makes so much sense for keeping dental appliances fresh and pleasant to (have to) use.  My orthodontia was done in my 60s; for this Golden Girl, keeping my retainers clean is now a joy!  And my spouse&#x27;s night guard is getting used regularly, because it is &amp;#34;tasty&amp;#34; to wear.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and love how it has made my life much easier with regard to cleaning my sleep apnea mouth piece.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is not an essential gadget for dentures, as it does nothing an ordinary container can&#x27;t do.  As others have noted, it is noisy and the vibrations cause it to move around, nevrer mind the expense of batteries.  After using it without the battery for a couple of years, the inner dish became coated from either hard-water calcium or from the Smile Again denture cleaner, and could not be cleaned.  Now I use a shallow glass jar which seems more sanitary.</li>
    <li> I got mine from dentist to clean dentures; he called it &amp;#34;ultrasonic&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s obviously not ultra anything. Another ad calls a similar one a &amp;#34;sonic cleaner&amp;#34; which is more accurate. With effervescent tablets it seems to clean OK, but I was instructed to use electric toothbrush first, so it&#x27;s not clear if it does anything more than leaving the denture in effervescent solution overnight. As others have written, it can be messy if you don&#x27;t keep it from walking away; mine has four small rubber feet which minimize vibration-travel. Without those, it wouldn&#x27;t stay put at all, and wouldn&#x27;t earn one star. There&#x27;s no auto shut-off so I set my smartphone alarm for 5 minutes. It&#x27;s medium noisy but not obnoxious unless you&#x27;ve a sensitive partner hanging about. It&#x27;s very important to rinse it after each use, then wipe it dry, else water will seep into the battery compartment. Eventually even being careful cannot prevent it from getting rusted,. Mine lasted about a year until it suddenly wouldn&#x27;t start again. I haven&#x27;t taken it apart but surely will find a small corroded 3v electric motor that&#x27;s not worth trying to repair. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> my adult son and I both have dental retainers after orthodontic treatment.  best way I&#x27;ve found to clean them (of course we each have our own).</li>
    <li> Just retuned the produce today because I received it broken and I&#x27;m up set that I had to pay postage to return something broken</li>
    <li> Not pleased.  The box was dented, ancient and covered in dust, which is gross.  When I opened it up it seemed ok but I ran the container portion through the dishwasher.  The battery operated portion of this was bizarre.  It takes 2 AA batteries.  When I went to install them, they would not fit properly into the machine and the battery compartment cover would not close.  Bizarrely, when I went to switch it on, even with batteries that didn&#x27;t fit properly, it actually worked.  But if I had it to do again I would certainly buy this item elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Love this sonic cleaner. Your dentures or partials are always clean and sweet smelling. No bad breath. This is the second one I have purchased. Wore the&lt;br /&gt;first one out. Had to buy 2 of them as my cousin wanted one for herself. Good product and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Cheap solution to a problem you didn&#x27;t know you had.</li>
    <li> Wished I had bought the electric one.</li>
    <li> Great way to keep your retainers fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> It already stopped working after 2 weeks very disappointed .. Don&#x27;t buy it !!</li>
    <li> It helps, but does not clean as well as I hoped!</li>
    <li> Works great, cleans my retainer really good!</li>
    <li> Works exceptionaly well on both dentures and jewery.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife to clean and store her dental mouth piece during the day.  She is very pleased with the gift.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is perfect for cleaning my retainer.  It also works well as a storage device for the retainer too.  I have been using it quite a while now (a couple years perhaps) and would buy another!</li>
