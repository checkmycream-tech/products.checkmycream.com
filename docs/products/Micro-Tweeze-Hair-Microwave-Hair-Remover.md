      <li>To be completely honest, this product did not work well.</li>
      <li>so I just have to watch it as I warm it up.</li>
      <li>and I decided that I can wax my own &#x27;stache and save myself the $10 or so</li>
      <li>Heats up nicely in the microwave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of stopped working as well as of now</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t liked the way any of the nail shops or spas have done mine here</li>
      <li>but so worth it!!!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 10+ years and it is the easiest and most cost effective product I have ever found.  </li>
      <li>I have to warm mine for longer than it says on the directions but make sure you test it on your wrist before applying it, so that you don&#x27;t burn yourself.  </li>
      <li>This wax is so easy to use!</li>
      <li>I was so nervous but this was so easy to use!  </li>
      <li>Easy to heat and use!</li>

      <li>This is a very good wax, easy to use and very efficient.</li>

      <li>Graduated to underarms, then mustache and now most of my face, and the brazilian bikini.</li>

      <li>A huge jar for the price but also not as effective as I would like.</li>
      <li>but it sure didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome because it&#x27;s totally re-usable too!  </li>
      <li>Love this product, worked well for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I would say this product is not comparable to some of the more pricey options.</li>

      <li>Very smooth and clean!</li>
      <li>I got my eyebrows &amp; lip waxed recenty for the first time at a salon and loved it</li>
      <li>I will buy more as this was easy.  </li>
      <li>I just used this to wax my own eyebrows for the very first time.</li>
      <li>It melts easily in the microwave, goes on smoothly with included popsicle-type sticks, and comes off very cleanly.  </li>
      <li>It melts easy, stirs easy, holds it&#x27;s heat and pliability, and works.</li>
      <li>Easy to prepare...</li>
      <li>This is so easy,</li>
      <li>I was able to cleanly remove hair from where ever I applied it.  </li>
      <li>It easily peeled off when the waxed cooled anyway.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>but I like using this one because you don&#x27;t have to use the strips &amp; it comes off easily.</li>
      <li>Easy to heat, easy to apply, and extremely easy cleanup.</li>
      <li>It was soooo easy.  </li>
      <li>With that being said, this warms up easily &amp; once you get the hang of it</li>
      <li>Once you figure out the right balance its great, I highly reccomend!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After receiving a hard wax treatment at a salon for my underarms, I knew hard wax was the only way to go (at least for me). I&#x27;ve tried multiple kinds of regular hot wax and they always make a mess and only get one or two hairs. Micro Tweeze was great - easy to follow instructions, the wax never got too hot, and it got 95% of my hair in my underarms. It really only missed some of the softer, baby hairs and the ones growing in random directions. I haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere else yet, as I have to grow the hair out longer in other places, but I&#x27;m sure I will remain satisfied. Buy and extra pack of popsicle sticks while you&#x27;re at it though - this kit only comes with two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional nail tech with a wax license and have over 4 years of professional waxing experience. I have used hard wax for almost 2 years and know what I&#x27;m talking about. Normally I use wax warmer and pot wax at home but I wanted something for travel. I thought the microwavable is the answer, I was wrong about this one. This wax does not melt properly with recommended time, it brittles easily and does not remove all hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe I have to apply second time for upper lip. I will try other professional brand microwavables, at least they have a little handle that won&#x27;t burn my hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying $15 to have my eyebrows waxed and I decided that I can wax my own &#x27;stache and save myself the $10 or so that that costs so I thought I&#x27;d try this wax.  I haven&#x27;t been to a professional in about six months now because I&#x27;m pleased with this wax!  And it smells to me like it might actually be the exact same wax that the esthetician uses anyway!  It&#x27;s awesome because it&#x27;s totally re-usable too!  I tried it on my legs but just couldn&#x27;t get it right but for smaller, finer hairs and smaller areas it is perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wax for years! It&#x27;s great! No strips needed and really grabs the hair. Waxing is no fun so I&#x27;m happy this is just a one step process.</li>
    <li> Buy this with the wooden sticks and have some of the after waxing lotion handy. As everyone else mentioned, there are no directions. Depending on your microwave (mine is 900) put it in for increments of ~50 seconds on medium high and watch it. Stir it and repeat as necessary. Make sure you have your hair tied back and you test it on your finger before smearing hot wax on your face. I have some of the lotion and tools left over from a previously purchased Sally Hansen kit. You can use the wand stick that tells you if it&#x27;s too hot. I found this to be a good way to test the heat when using it for the first few times. Definitely buy those wooden sticks if you don&#x27;t already have them. There&#x27;s nothing worse than being excited to try something and realizing you don&#x27;t have everything you need:)</li>
    <li> I Have used the product once since i have gotten it in May. It worked pretty good for the first time using it. The wax is hard to get off those things after you get it on them, just don&#x27;t let it sit so long especially on your face otherwise you will probably have a hard time getting it off. It got the hairs off good too. I want to try it on my legs but it will probably take a long time and the stuff is messy too. Its to be expected when you buy it online and not from a professional hair salon.</li>
    <li> I bought this soley based on the great reviews and I am sure glad I did!  I got my eyebrows &amp; lip waxed recenty for the first time at a salon and loved it BUT it cost over $40.00!  I only spent $12.00 for a big jar of this and it was so easy to use.  I bought small applicators at my local beauty supply store and it worked perfect.  It got ALL the hair everywhere I put it.  I did a test strip on my leg just to see how if it worked there and I could not believe that it got the majority of the hair there even though I just shaved a couple of days ago and it was only stubble.  I had to melt the wax for about 2 mins before it got soft enough to use.  Also, I agree there is less redness than with other wax applications. Great product!</li>
    <li> Discovered MicroTweeze about 12 or 13 years ago. Easy to heat, easy to apply, and extremely easy cleanup. Never have to go over a spot because of missed hairs. I tried a couple other recommended brands a couple of times and none could even start to compare. Started with eyebrows and chin. Graduated to underarms, then mustache and now most of my face, and the brazilian bikini. The only reason not legs is because of the additional cost. Will never use any other product again. And, I always follow up with a little swipe of Azulene. I also have 6 daughters who now think they can&#x27;t live without it.  By the way, I am on Chemo at the moment and have 2 quarter-sized spots on my head that for some reason didn&#x27;t lose the hair. Looked like I was trying to start a new trend.  Anyway the MicroTweeze also took care of that problem without having razor stubble. As the kids say, \\&quot;This product Rocks\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have been paying top dollar for bikini/underarm waxing at the Salon for years and now that I found this product I can get them same results at home for a lot less money.  It is also much easier to not have to worry about making an appointment and trying to fit it in a very busy schedule.  I agree with the reviewer that said to have extra popsicle sticks handy and then just follow the directions that come with the product.  I have to warm mine for longer than it says on the directions but make sure you test it on your wrist before applying it, so that you don&#x27;t burn yourself.  I also pull the edges of the wax up just a little bit before it is dry and then when it almost dry and just barely tacky pull the surrounding skin tight and remove it quickly.  Painful but so worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this product it helps me remove unwanted hairs in minutes without having to go to a salon or making a mess.</li>
    <li> Removes unpleasant uni-brow hairs with ease, without the painful plucking.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product twice now and I like it quite a bit.  It is the only wax that actually removes hair and can be heated in the microwave.  I have used other products that haven&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a really easy to use product and comes with very helpful instructions and helpful tips.  I was able to cleanly remove hair from where ever I applied it.  I did get some portions didn&#x27;t come off with the larger portions.  I found that applying just a little bit more wax to those spots and then removing it typically got rid of the extra pieces.  The parts that didn&#x27;t come off I simply applied some hypoallergenic lotion and the pieces would loosen so they could be more easily removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just a couple of things I think people should be aware of and consider prior to purchasing.  1) if you use sunless tanner, it will remove the sunless tanner color. 2) as other reviewers have stated it does get quite stringy to you have to be careful that you don&#x27;t get tails/strings. You just have to develop a system for dealing with them and then they aren&#x27;t a big deal.  I will usually use my other hand that isn&#x27;t holding the application tool to break the string and then throw it in the garbage and I only use the product when I am on a tile surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product. It&#x27;s reasonably priced, works better than other waxes I&#x27;ve tried, and doesn&#x27;t require strips or a heating plate.</li>
    <li> I have used this awesome product for a couple of years now. Buying it off of the internet is so much more economical than the local beauty supply store.  This product is so simple to use. Heat in the microwave, apply, wait for a couple of minutes, then remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found it works best if I use a popsicle stick for application.  It also takes a couple of applications to figure out the best temperature for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It is fast, easy, economical.  The 8 oz jar will last you for many, many waxes.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax I have ever used!  It works perfectly!  I recently used it on my bikini line and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Best product I have ever used to get rid of hair.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Was needs strips.  I thought there was something different about this product but they it&#x27;s just regular wax (see ingredients) yet they tell you that it doesn&#x27;t require strips.  It was a crumbly and complete mess, and just not very effective.  Would probably be good if used with the strips.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax hair removal product I have found.  Easy and quick to use. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to save money removing wax at home.</li>
    <li> I have never waxed, nor ever been waxed. I have been a mite apprehensive to say the least. I decided to try this and I am loving it. I have used it on 3 separate occasions and recommend it unequivocally. I follow the directions and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this product and it does what I need it to do. I have very limited experience with other waxes so I cannot compare it to those. I use this wax on my chin and it gets most of the hairs the first time. Sometimes I have to go back and apply another layer to remove all the hairs but usually two times gets it done. The one issue I have is warming it up. I follow the instructions on the box but the wax either doesn&#x27;t melt or it melts too much. It probably just depends on the microwave and the wattage. I don&#x27;t know how to determine what my wattage is so I just have to watch it as I warm it up. I&#x27;ve never tried it on other areas of my body but if your goal is facial hair removal, then this works well.</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to hair remover for quite a few years.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to use little strips of cloth -- just the popsicle stick to apply.  I also really like that you can microwave the jar.  Waxing is never fun, but at least this does the trick!</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. I&#x27;m a spaz, and let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m a woman of a certain age. This is so easy, even I can&#x27;t screw it up. Heat in microwave, spread, let cool,yank. And it works!!</li>
    <li> This product is the greatest! Easy to use,produces great results &amp; the price was the best. I will be a repeat customer for this product!</li>
    <li> This is a decent wax. I am not a professional by any means when it comes to waxing. It&#x27;s difficult for me to figure out how hot it should be to use properly &amp; I tend to make a mess (no matter how hard I try). With that being said, this warms up easily &amp; once you get the hang of it this wax does a decent job. I use it on my face &amp; have a difficult time getting all of the hairs the first go around (my issue on how hot it should be) but I like using this one because you don&#x27;t have to use the strips &amp; it comes off easily.</li>
    <li> I needed something to replace a very similar version of this that was made by Nair and I think this one may be even better.  This product heats up quickly and was easy to apply to my legs and came off in a snap without any mess.  The hair on my leg was very short and I had no issues with this product missing any of them.  Great price and a very good product.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic because I think a lot of the reviews here are fake, but this wax really does come off clean - no sticky residue - and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to remove like wax strips.  I will most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This wax is stickier than normal when it hardens.  It makes it a little messier than I prefer.  It&#x27;s average on the pain scale.  The one thing I really didn&#x27;t like is it didn&#x27;t come in a box and there is a neon warning sticker on the jar that says &amp;#34;read directions on box first!!!&amp;#34; So, that&#x27;s ridiculous.  Fortunately, I was smart and heated it in 15 second intervals.  I have  a weak, cheap microwave and 15 seconds was pushing it.  This stuff melts fast!!  And it looks like they aren&#x27;t shipping us the full package, so I&#x27;m doing my duty as a responsible buyer and warning everyone to be careful.  It clearly states that the jar will melt if you heat it too much.  Plus, the obvious being that you could severely, and permanently, hurt yourself. So, my unprofessional suggestion, if you have a decent or better microwave, would be to literally check and stir it every five seconds... No matter how annoying or silly that May seem.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> it worked really well for a first time waxing person. The item didn&#x27;t actually include any instructions though or it would have 5 stars</li>
    <li> Difficult to use... i have to keep reheating it and it gets cold really fast...it also heats from the core so, some of it ends up being really hot and the rest not. Pain in the butt.</li>
    <li> Works okay....easier just to use real tweezers.</li>
    <li> The pro is that it is easy to use, and not that messy if you are careful. Definitely better than other at-home wax kits. The con, for me, is that it fails to get every hair pulled. I didn&#x27;t want to have to wax the same spot over again, thus damaging my sensitive skin, so I just stopped using it. :(</li>
    <li> I MUCH prefer the inexpensive Gigi home brazilian kit. Does the SAME exact thing, but of course because it&#x27;s the actual warmer, wax and accessories the wax never gets too cool. IDK about you folks but my microwave is NOT in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I once used another brand, I forget which (though I can picture the packaging - my daughter drew a mustache on the model on the box, ha ha) which used paper strips to adhere to the wax and then you pull the strips off. That worked fine but they changed the formula and it didn&#x27;t work anymore for me. For a long time I&#x27;d pluck a little bit and dye the hairs blond but I got tired of my blond mustache so decided to see if there was some other product that would work for me. This Micro Tweeze stuff had decent reviews and it&#x27;s not that expensive... I decided to give it a try and discovered that it works very well!  As well as the other stuff I liked but without the hassle of the paper strips. It takes longer to microwave than the instructions say, but not very long and it doesn&#x27;t get super hot, just warm. I put it on my lip (one side, then the other) and it takes very little time for the wax to become firm. It takes some resolve to pull it off, like removing a bandaid from a sensitive spot, but I&#x27;m tough, I can do it! My upper lip is red for a while (don&#x27;t do it right before work or a date or a photoshoot!) but the hairs are gone. Last time I used it, I had to do one little patch over again and pluck a couple of strays, that&#x27;s it. Because I only use it on my upper lip, my 8 oz container will last a very long time. I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness on other areas of the body.</li>
    <li> I have used this wax for years and love it.  You just heat it up in the microwave and go.  No strips needed.  I use it on my bikini line, eyebrows and upper lip and think it is excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a different wax for many years, but it has gotten increasingly expensive and nearly impossible to find. Because of that, I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a comparable wax that is affordable, easy to use, and EFFECTIVE. There&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than pulling a wax strip and seeing fuzz still on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax I used previously was available in a little tube, so application was a cinch. Jars and potted wax have always proven to be difficult to use - taking forever to heat up, not sticking well, feeling gummy, not removing hair, messy, etc. - but also nearly impossible to use on the brow area. MicroTweeze was a pleasant surprise! The wax (large size) heated up in a minute and a half, and it was very easy to apply. I purchased the small brow applicator wooden spatulas available/recommended on Amazon, and they really helped on the brow area. The lip and chin went easy-peasy, but for me the real test came with the brows.  With the applicators, my brows are now perfectly arched, not a stray in sight! Just put it on when the wax has cooled to the consistency of honey, make sure it&#x27;s a thick enough strip (should look caramel in color, not opaque), then when the strip is barely tacky and still pliable, hold skin taut and pull the strip in the opposite direction of hair growth. Very smooth and clean!</li>
    <li> I am a first time waxer and bought this product from the reviews.  Please note I used the entire 8oz to do my eyebrows, upper lip/chin, and arms.  I will buy more as this was easy.  It took a long time to do all this 1hr 15 mins and I was really red for about 4 hours afterwards - as I have sensitive skin.  It didn&#x27;t hurt at all - suprised!  It does smell like turpintine, you will have residue on your nails, some hairs it just won&#x27;t grab but it took out about 98%.  I found on another site for six dollars less though - upset as I order everything from Amazon so this is shocking at the price difference.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> Sorry.  I can&#x27;t stand this product.  I&#x27;ve been using the GiGi cream wax for years and thought that maybe it would be nice to not have to constantly buy muslin strips.  I read the positive reviews and was so hopeful, yet it just isn&#x27;t the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is a good wax for very fine, downy hair removal but it sure didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.</li>
    <li> To be completely honest, this product did not work well. The gel would stick to my skin and it was very painful to remove. Also, it removed very little hair.</li>
    <li> I am a first time wax-er (gotten my eyebrows waxed once in a salon, but never done it myself).  I used this product last weekend and was amazed at how well it turned out!  The product was easy to heat and, while a little messy, went on well.  My eyebrows look great and I had so little irritation!  When I got my brows professionally waxed, I was red and puffy and noticeably \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; where they waxed for over 24 hours!  With this product, however, I was red for an hour or less, and perfectly normal by the time I went to bed (and I waxed when I got home from work that night!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the excellent reviews on this product; they really swayed my decision to try it, and I am so glad I did!</li>
    <li> I moved here a couple of years ago and left behind my \\&quot;eyebrow lady\\&quot; (yes there actually was a place where people went just to get eyebrows done where I used to live) from old home and my old perfect brows.  I haven&#x27;t liked the way any of the nail shops or spas have done mine here and I&#x27;ve tried doing my own with tweezers and with a couple other at home wax like products.  So I studied up on internet tutorials on eyebrow shaping an tried this product. This one has worked the best for me.  My brows look the best that they have since I&#x27;ve moved here!  It did take me a little trial and error to figure out how much wax and how hot to go.  Too little wax or too hot is painful and unsuccessful but warm and a little more than neccessary seems to do the trick. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did at first and try to cover all the spots you want to wax before your used to it, go one at a time, (or else your going to have a long painful learning curve LOL).  Once you figure out the right balance its great, I highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different kinds of hair removal from waxes to manual tweezing to depilatories and have never found one that I have completely liked. All had one or two things that I was pleased with but often had a feature or two that made the use unpleasant.  But none ever came close to this product.  It melts easy, stirs easy, holds it&#x27;s heat and pliability, and works. Bottom line: it removes the hair. I used it on my upper lip and chin and could not believe the fine hairs that were on the wax! It also pulled out those few coarse hairs that I often have to tweeze even after a professional wax. But the best part is the fact there is NO RESIDUE. What little wax that gets left behind wipes off so easily with no stickiness to speak of. I will be buying more jars of this product and recommending to anyone who wants to wax at home. Great price and highly effective product makes this one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I am totally frustrated here.  After reading so many great reviews, I was really enthused about trying this new (to me) product.  The big brown box arrived and I unpacked the items carefully.  Hmm.  This arrived without a box, just wrapped in plastic, and WITHOUT ANY DIRECTIONS AT ALL!  I searched through reviews to put together an &amp;#34;educated guess&amp;#34; at what to do, but at this price a box with instructions is expected.  I suspect that the problem originated at the packing location, not the manufacturer, but it was a problem that gave me a rough introduction to this product.  I will not be ordering this again; hot wax is something that should not be done without a guide.</li>
    <li> Little residual, but would&#x27;ve been nice to include a small bottle of oil or something like other products to help wash it away. Soap and water just won&#x27;t do. Other than that, it works alright. Leaves some hair here and there.</li>
    <li> Good for small areas like face. Ready to use, no fuss!!</li>
    <li> I just used this to wax my own eyebrows for the very first time. I was so nervous but this was so easy to use!  It spread on easily, hardened enough quickly, and came off easily. I was very impressed with the results!  It was a little messy, but I&#x27;m inexperienced. It was also less painful than when I get waxed at the salon. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for my eyebremsows for years and had problems finding good products in my area.  this is ot only asuperior product but also an unbelievale value this will last a long time. I am so pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a rosin wax with strips for years and am very proficient.  Thought a wax that didn&#x27;t need strips would be faster. Maybe for small patches you can get the proper thickness, but on legs and thighs, putting down a longer length is necessary and keeping it thick is hard.  Plus keeping that exact temp to maintain application is short lived. I had snibels of it all over my leg, had to scrape it off with a butter knife after soaking my leg in baby oil.  Never again! $15 down the drain.</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times.  It works great.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST wax ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Please note that I have never waxed myself or even gotten waxed at a salon, but I used this product by myself and it was great.  Quick, easy, left little mess. It BARELY hurt. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this to wax my side burns and around my face. It works great and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> very few left if the targeted hair is long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Down side is having to wait for hair to be long enough. So you&#x27;re either very hairy(waiting to wax), completely bare(freshly waxed) or have to shave the hairs that aren&#x27;t long enough to be out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY economical compared to having it done in a salon.</li>
    <li> Going to the salon just got too expensive for me.  I&#x27;ve been using the Sally Hansen/Nair strips and/or creme for years.  They work in a pinch but can be a little painful and ineffective.  Some of the cremes smelled bad and the wax strips left a ton of residue.  I came across this because I did not necessarily invest in a whole wax kit (the warmer and all that stuff).  Plus, the idea is to reduce my expenses not add to them.  The microTweeze had decent reviews so I tried it.  First off I had to microwave mine for about 2 minutes.  I used one of the two sticks (included) to apply the wax to my upper lip.  It is not nearly as hot as the wax in salons.  I followed the directions and peeled off the wax.  To my surprise, it did not hurt at all.  It works better than the pre-waxed strips and less painful.  There is VERY little residue at all.  It easily peeled off when the waxed cooled anyway. It got both course and fine hairs.  It didn&#x27;t get every single last hair so I had to tweeze just a tad, but the wax made those stubborn hairs easier to pluck. It can be a bit messy, but it gets easier with practice.  I got this with Prime for around $12.  It will last a long time.  I bought the strips at $6 a pack and they lasted about a month so this is WELL WORTH the $12.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about waxing myself! This wax is so easy to use! I suggest ordering some extra Popsicle sticks.it can also be messy, But I p,an to buy it again.</li>
    <li> It can get costly going to the salon every few weeks just to wax a little bit of facial hair. This product is seriously saving me money. It&#x27;s pretty simple, heat up the wax, use a wooden stick, dip it into the wax and apply where necessary. You don&#x27;t need to use strips of fabric at all. It actually works. I recommend heating up the entire jar (the instructions say not to, but if you monitor the jar in the microwave and don&#x27;t let it get too hot, you&#x27;ll be fine). The one downside is it only comes with a few wooden sticks, but it&#x27;s pretty cheap to buy a stash of them at a craft store or wherever. Basically I spent about $13 which is lasting several months instead of $15 a month. For something that removes unwanted facial hair (and actually does!)</li>
    <li> Works excellent!  I will never buy another brand again.  Microwave the jar for 45 seconds or so and then apply with a stick.  Pull off about 15 seconds later.  I bought a highly reviewed honey type with strips and it was perfectly awful.  This stuff works!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical since all other waxes have never really worked.  I followed the directions exactly and used on my eyebrows and upper lip.  It was soooo easy.  You will a pretty gnarly red mark but i will go away in a few hours.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10+ years and it is the easiest and most cost effective product I have ever found.  I&#x27;ll never which period!</li>
    <li> It was OK. A huge jar for the price but also not as effective as I would like. It left hair behind and also tended to make little strings and was pretty messy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. There are other brands that are better.</li>
    <li> Best wax ever! Love that this wax doesn&#x27;t require anything other than a microwave! I will order it again and again! I highly recommend this to anyone &amp; everyone!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 6 years. My hairdresser introduced me to it and I now use it at home. Its great for mustache areas and eyebrows. It grabs the fine hairs and doesnt let go. I highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product repeatedly on several different areas on my body. It worked okay in some areas but did very poorly in others. It was extremely painful. Also, the jar melted the first time I tried to microwave it even though it was on a microwave safe plate. I would not buy it again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality wax. Heats up nicely in the microwave. Less messy than other brands I&#x27;ve used. Comes off easy and did a fairly nice job for a home wax system.</li>
    <li> Of all of the facial hair removers I have tried, this one works the best. It doesn&#x27;t take long to warm-up, less then 2 minutes total. When I put it on it was very sticky and left tails of wax. It wasn&#x27;t too hard to apply though. It does grab all of the little hairs and will rip off quickly and not leave any residue. The area does feel a bit tender the next day, but that is to be expected. Also, I had to so the same area a couple of times over, but it still worked better then anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for! great wax for microwave. Odor free, does not burn your skin like other waxes.</li>
    <li> Easy to heat and use!</li>
    <li> This is a very good wax, easy to use and very efficient. The only thing I dislike: the two sticks included are too small, so don&#x27;t hesitate to buy more sticks; and there are no wipes included, unfortunately. Nevertheless, this is a good product! I recommend.</li>
    <li> THis wax is GREAT!  After using waxes for years that stuck to my face and were very crumbly, and not good at removing hair, I found this wax.  It melts easily in the microwave, goes on smoothly with included popsicle-type sticks, and comes off very cleanly.  It also seems to hurt less than others I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s the best i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> great size for the price around 9bucks. I get many many uses out of this jar. I used to buy it in local drugstore, but they dont&#x27; sell it anymore. I am glad I found it online.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anybody that wants mess free waxing at home!!! Just learn to use it properly. LOVE IT will buy it forever</li>
    <li> This is the best wax ive tried. It has a slight smell, almost like wood, not bad though. And of course it stings, but it removes all the hair from the area. I have sensitive skin and had no reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 complaints. 1 it is messy, i kept having long strings of the wax come off after i applied the initial smear. 2. It cooled rather quickly. By the time i did my eyebrows and upper lip it was too cool to coniue without rewarming.</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at home waxing. It is so easy to use. The wax can get a little messy but I will have to figure that out on my own. You heat it in the microwave, put it on, let it cool a little and rip it off. That simple! I will never shave my under arms again, only wax them with Micro Tweeze!</li>
    <li> It works well enough. It&#x27;s kind of stopped working as well as of now so I think it&#x27;s time to try something new. . .</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  I was no longer able to purchase it at the local beauty supply stores and was glad to find it available on Amazon.  Easy to use because you don&#x27;t need a warmer or have to use the cloths that other waxes use.  Just heat it in the microwave and go.</li>
    <li> Painful to use. Hard to use because of no strips. Was hard to tear away because it pieces of wax would be left behind and not easy to wash off in the shower. Will never use this again. Back to strips</li>
    <li> I buy the 8oz container and use it for lip &amp; chin. Microwave for 3 minutes and it melts enough for the job. Quick and easy, and removes all hair. But cheaper at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Works great for removing facial hair.  Is a bit messy.  Easy to prepare...just microwave and apply.  Would recommend for facial hair removal.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Gets the job done. I love the ease with which you can use this product.&lt;br /&gt;So, you are getting ready to go somewhere and you realize, crap I have hair on my lip! No problem put this in the microwave and in two minutes you are ready to apply. After applying let it dry for about 3-4 minutes so it&#x27;s dry enough to just pull off.(Make sure to add an extra layer of wax it&#x27;s easier to pull off).  *Sometimes if left on too long it will take off the top layer of your skin. It also drips so I put a napkin under my chin when applying. Great for any part of the face.&lt;br /&gt; In short, easy to use, no need for muslin cloth, and great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Love this product, worked well for me. Only problem was a crack in the side of the jar. I didn&#x27;t want to send it back so duck tape to the rescue.</li>
    <li> I used this product for my lip hair, eyebrow hair and leg hair. It took longer to microwave than instructions posited, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well on my lip hair and took most of it off, although I did have to apply it a second time and tweeze to get rid of excess hair. The wax did almost nothing to my eyebrows. The fine hair that I really wanted to go away stayed. I tried at many different temperatures thinking maybe I was doing something wrong. Nope. The application on my legs was a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say this product is not comparable to some of the more pricey options. I can only use this product for my lip hair because it is not effective at taking off excess hair. I have not tried the bikini area, but I will save myself the torture. Definitely not buying this product again, and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> The BEST wax for eyebrows and upper lip. No allergic reaction, no cloths needed. I have been using for years and Amazon has the BEST price. The cost of one jar equals 6/7 trips to the salon</li>
    <li> I reorder this as I need it. It works very well and I will continue to reorder it.</li>
    <li> i wasn&#x27;t able to microwave it a second time...it started sparking, and buzzing, there wasn&#x27;t anything else in it. but i guess as far as wax goes , it worked really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert at waxing, but I&#x27;m pretty certain I did everything just as the directions describe.  But I tried this wax on my legs and it did little more than get all over my bathroom--just a little bit here, and a little bit there, but it&#x27;s very hard to clean up.  And I actually moved my microwave into the bathroom to try and minimize the mess.&lt;br /&gt;  I tried it on my upper lip, too, and it worked a little better there, but it still left quite a bit of fuzz.  Maybe 2 or 3 tries would have gotten it all, but of course, it hurts (no surprise), and I didn&#x27;t think the repeated pain was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;  Also, I&#x27;m not sure how this amount of wax is supposed to be enough for your legs--the best I could come up with was to keep reusing the same wax...?&lt;br /&gt;  Oh, well, it was an experiment.  If I ever decide to wax again, I&#x27;ll go to a salon.</li>
    <li> Best wax remover on the market for face. Don&#x27;t overheat it! If it stirs really easily, it&#x27;s too hot. It works best at a thin glue-like consistency.</li>
