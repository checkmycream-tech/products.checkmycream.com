      <li>However, I think it would be better with stronger bronzers</li>
      <li>I think you will love this, I did until the end of the day :)</li>
      <li>I kept looking in the mirror, yesterday, because I am so pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I think most people would love it.</li>
      <li>Scent free, very light and silky.</li>
      <li>I had been using Picture Perfect the pore reducing formula, but decided to try this for a little more moisture.</li>
      <li>a fine 5 star product!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>If they added perfumes to this lotion it would have a huge likelihood of causing irritations or breakouts.</li>
      <li>perfumes&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling smooth</li>
      <li>This lotion made my face extremely smooth also helped boost color with no problems with streaky lines.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a great deal and you can&#x27;t beat Designer Skin when it comes to tanning products.</li>
      <li>Has a light scent.</li>
      <li>but I tried this cuz it said it was good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, its not heavy, not oily, has bronzer in it for a nice touch of color.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin, and this is ok for me!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it hasn&#x27;t worked.</li>
      <li>Its tiny.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was quick though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The girl working at the tanning salon recommended this lotion and of course I came right to Amazon (where the prices are MUCH more reasonable) and ordered a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This lotion is listed as unscented, and I think that&#x27;s a pretty accurate description.</li>
      <li>Very very pleased with this lotion and will definitely add it to my regimen from here on out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As another cluster review said this is good for keeping all the freckles coming out when tanning I love it and will defiantly buy more when this runs out you only need a drop so it should last a while depending on how much you tan</li>
      <li>great gradual tanning product for everyday and tanning use</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I would honestly use this as a daily moisturizer I like it so much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very handy small bottle that you can take anywhere..</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this facial lotion.</li>
      <li>This lotion is okay, doesn&#x27;t give you any extra boost of color, doesn&#x27;t help with my oily skin.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what i thought i was getting</li>
      <li>not my favorite facial lotion it smells like plastic!!</li>
      <li>Its more of a bronzer lotion that you would use while applying makeup than an actual tanning lotion because the lotion itself is tinted</li>
      <li>so I was able to write a proper review based on results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had this bottle from the actual salon and even though it was $10 more</li>
      <li>Most facial bronzers run $40 and up.</li>
      <li>Would definitely purchase more.</li>
      <li>First of all, this lotion is expired.</li>
      <li>I love the facial bronzer</li>
      <li>Smells clean, soft, &amp; nice.&lt;br /&gt;Evens</li>
      <li>So if you want something strictly for the tanning bed, you might see some positive results from this.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good facial lotion, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy and has somewhat helped improve my skin tone though I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in the color of my face.</li>
      <li>Going on it feels very nice and emollient, the color is darker out of the bottle than the other facial bronzers I have used by Designer Skin</li>
      <li>Does not make my face greasy, no strong smell and nice mild bronzing action!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>lotion does not have much of a scent at all.</li>
      <li>I like it, but it will sometimes make my skin break out if I use it too much.</li>
      <li>I really like the color it gives my skin.</li>
      <li>To be fair I only tried it once, so it might be worth a second shot as any breakout can be triggered for multiple reasons.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much but make my face oily after</li>
      <li>Truly not a pore clogger which I appreciated.</li>
      <li>have combo skin and seems to be helping with pores.&lt;br /&gt;You really need a bottle of this in your tanning rotation.</li>
      <li>After using it you can really tell that it does indeed absorb the oil.</li>
      <li>So far I LOVE this facial bronzer/tanning lotion!!!</li>
      <li>The good thing is that you only need a little applied since the skin on your face is so much more sensitive than on the rest of your body, so this lotion will last for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face is a very even, natural color thanks to using this lotion!</li>
      <li>I tryed this product so far no brake outs and its been all most six months,and I think I have a few more weeks left of the bottle I go six months ago</li>
      <li>highly* recommend this lotion to anyone who, like me, wants to have their face &amp;#34;catch</li>
      <li>I have tried many other brands of tanning lotions and bronzers but ALWAYS return to Designer Skin!</li>
      <li>I bought this to see if my tanning season this year would be different and sure enough, it is!</li>
      <li>I would recommend it, but don&#x27;t set your expectations too high.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first when I saw the bronze color because I am so fair complected</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell too great and clogged my pores super bad.</li>
      <li>but it went on easily was  not too dark for my face</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product does not make my face break out or burn.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>&amp; it def kept my pores clear!</li>
      <li>Not exactly what I&#x27;m looking for since I tan to dry out my pimples, not create more.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price and works great for the face ...would order it again</li>
    <li> I thought I was breaking out on my chin because I smoke so I had just come to the conclusion its the price ill pay however the girls at my salon informed me its from using body lotion on my face while I tanned. They sold me this for $11 because I buy from them weekly. After using it you can really tell that it does indeed absorb the oil. Where have you been all my tanning life? As far as color im just at the point of maintaining but its tinted so im sure youll see color from using it.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin! &amp; it def kept my pores clear!</li>
    <li> Gives really great color very quickly! Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. Definitely worth the money. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but you only use it for your face, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells great and received the correct lotion in the bottle bc I compared this to lotion at sun city tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t break my face out. Has a light scent. Did help control oil. Arrived sealed. Used twice and noticed a color difference.</li>
    <li> Non-comodegenic (won&#x27;t clog your pores/won&#x27;t give you acne!)&lt;br /&gt;Oil-Free!&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free! Smells clean, soft, &amp; nice.&lt;br /&gt;Evens out skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;Can be used as a daily moisturizer/or during your tanning sessions!&lt;br /&gt;Slightly bronzes your face! A good pre prep for makeup users!&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive! Well made &amp; put together!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a fine 5 star product!&lt;br /&gt;Well done Designer Skin!&lt;br /&gt;A must buy product!</li>
    <li> Its tiny.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was quick though.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smell. But it does its job.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this a few times so I was able to write a proper review based on results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I got this is because I felt that I had reached a plateau in my tanning and was dark, but didn&#x27;t feel like it was a &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; enough tan; especially on my face. The girl working at the tanning salon recommended this lotion and of course I came right to Amazon (where the prices are MUCH more reasonable) and ordered a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it 3 times consecutively and am blown away by the results. I kept looking in the mirror, yesterday, because I am so pleased with the results. My face is so much darker than it was 3 days ago - not just a little darker, but a lot darker. My face has the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; color that I felt I had been missing. Very very pleased with this lotion and will definitely add it to my regimen from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion does not have much of a scent at all. It almost smells a little like plastic when you put it on and then completely fades away to smelling like nothing after a few minutes. It&#x27;s not greasy at all either. The good thing is that you only need a little applied since the skin on your face is so much more sensitive than on the rest of your body, so this lotion will last for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *highly* recommend this lotion to anyone who, like me, wants to have their face &amp;#34;catch up&amp;#34; to the rest of their tan and bring it to the next level!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear to be the same stuff sold in the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this facial lotion. My face is a very even, natural color thanks to using this lotion! I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused any flare ups. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin. My big issue is that while tanning does limit my break outs, the initial building up my base tan period seems to cause more due to lotion on my face. I bought this to see if my tanning season this year would be different and sure enough, it is! The break outs have been limited, and my face is tanning evenly with the rest of my body. The smell isnt an issue, and there&#x27;s no after tan odor that I notice.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I knew this would be along shot anyways, but this is not that great. Its more of a bronzer lotion that you would use while applying makeup than an actual tanning lotion because the lotion itself is tinted so you look tanner but its like one of those gross fake tans you get and if you rub your face or neck even a little bit it comes off in flakes. Yeah, it&#x27;s as disgusting as it sounds. It also doesn&#x27;t smell too great and clogged my pores super bad. So, I had two options keep this on and have a tan but possibly flakey face if I wasn&#x27;t careful and break out like crazy or wash my face to clean my pores, hence removing all color from my face. It literally is just a tinted lotion it did not help me gain color in the tanning bed whatsoever. I use the jwoww one and done on my body and I have just been using that on my face as well and I don&#x27;t break out as long as I wash my face that night and it doesn&#x27;t wash away my color like this does.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin... this product did not help with my oil and it broke me out a little, as well. I would only suggest this to people who don&#x27;t usually break out at all. For those who have sensitive or acne prone skin, I&#x27;d suggest using a moisturizer like Cetaphil in the tanning bed and to only use tanning lotion on the body. I give this product ONE STAR, but I&#x27;m doing three because the shipping and packaging was a five star. Thank you!</li>
    <li> So far I LOVE this facial bronzer/tanning lotion!!! I have tried many other brands of tanning lotions and bronzers but ALWAYS return to Designer Skin! I never get to use bronzer on my face while in the tanning bed because it breaks me out but now I can with this awesome product!!! Does not make my face greasy, no strong smell and nice mild bronzing action!</li>
    <li> The numbers on the bottom of the bottle are NOT an expiration date. I was concerned that they were, so I contacted Designer Skin directly. The numbers are batch numbers and are used solely for manufacturing purposes. If you look on the back of the lotion, there is an image of a jar with the lid open. Inside the jar, it will say 12M, 18M, or 24M, and that is the shelf life of your product.</li>
    <li> Excellent ! I had to purchase this because my face was breaking out with the regular lotions .. So far my skin on my face has been doing great! It does smell like tanning lotion .. I wish it had a better smell to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of price, and because it has a bronzed in it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- long lasting, as a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to carry packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Smells HORRIBLE! Horrible! I mean horrible! Like burned rubber.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t improve tan&lt;br /&gt;Leaves face greasy afterwards. (If you scratch or run your face, product will rub off)</li>
    <li> This lotion made my face extremely smooth also helped boost color with no problems with streaky lines. A little goes a long way, and lots of quality for the price. Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent so all in all, great buy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i thought i was getting</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Very handy small bottle that you can take anywhere..scent is very pleasant and does not irritate my face.  Would definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> First of all, this lotion is expired. Secondly, it came leaking all over everything. Not happy. I&#x27;ll stick to buying my lotions at the salon.</li>
    <li> Expect bottle to be way bigger but I could literally stick the bottle in a shirt pocket. Over priced for such a little bottle.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. I have to minimize use of foundation, and other make up because they&#x27;ll cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I was searching for a tanning solution that doesn&#x27;t have heavy perfumes, and wouldn&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to laugh a little about people complaining about the smell of this lotion. If they added perfumes to this lotion it would have a huge likelihood of causing irritations or breakouts. This lotion is listed as unscented, and I think that&#x27;s a pretty accurate description. I would honestly use this as a daily moisturizer I like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts&lt;br /&gt;No heavy irritants/perfumes&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling smooth&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes oiliness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get my tan dark as fast as I would like it to</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, its not heavy, not oily, has bronzer in it for a nice touch of color. My face hasn&#x27;t broken out and has developed nice color.</li>
    <li> It didnt not work well did not see any color change ...I tryed it a few times stil not change</li>
    <li> I was very pale when I started tanning and this product got my face super dark within a week. I was so very happy.</li>
    <li> Works well with my ridiculously sensitive skin. Also gives a beautiful glow after tanning. I&#x27;m very fair and it gives me a natural tan, no orange.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Works well, non greasy, gives a nice tanned glow! Yes the bottle is small, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s meant to be used on your face, not your entire body. When used sparingly on the face it lasts quite a while!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion a while back. It didn&#x27;t do much but make my face oily after and my skin broke out. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type but I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Caused break outs that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have existed. Couldn&#x27;t come close to finishing bottle because skin would get consistently worse with use. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> works so well for getting an even tan on your face and doesnt break out my skin!</li>
    <li> Has a plastic like smell but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance. Overall it&#x27;s a good facial lotion, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy and has somewhat helped improve my skin tone though I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in the color of my face.</li>
    <li> show a color different in just 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Scent free, very light and silky. I have very sensitive skin and this product does not make my face break out or burn. I apply before tanning and also use as a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make my face any tanner.  I would recommend it, but don&#x27;t set your expectations too high.</li>
    <li> I really like the color it gives my skin.</li>
    <li> Didnt make me as dark as I wamted.</li>
    <li> It was slightly larger than a bottle of nail polish.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great.</li>
    <li> not my favorite facial lotion it smells like plastic!! Still works just the same and I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> This lotion is okay, doesn&#x27;t give you any extra boost of color, doesn&#x27;t help with my oily skin.  Designer skin is overrated.</li>
    <li> As another cluster review said this is good for keeping all the freckles coming out when tanning I love it and will defiantly buy more when this runs out you only need a drop so it should last a while depending on how much you tan</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was time for a facial bronzer but I didn&#x27;t want anything too greasy. So far I&#x27;m unimpressed, but I&#x27;ve also used some terrible bronzers in my day so the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really do anything might be a good thing. It barely moisturizes, it doesn&#x27;t seem to soak in at all. I also don&#x27;t notice the bronzing effect although that could be because I&#x27;m already fairly dark. I&#x27;ve noticed after the course of a few hours I&#x27;ll accidentally scratch or rub my face and it comes right off. So if you want something strictly for the tanning bed, you might see some positive results from this. If you want something that can moisturize and perform outside of a tanning salon, keep looking. However, the price tag for a relatively inoffensive Designer Skin product is unbeatable on this, especially from Amazon. Most facial bronzers run $40 and up.</li>
    <li> I had been using Picture Perfect the pore reducing formula, but decided to try this for a little more moisture. It unfortunately caused a minor breakout, which has never happened with Designer Skin products before, I use this brand almost exclusively because I do have problems with so many others. Going on it feels very nice and emollient, the color is darker out of the bottle than the other facial bronzers I have used by Designer Skin and I think most people would love it. Unless you have rosacea or adult acne I think you will love this, I did until the end of the day :)</li>
    <li> This lotion prevents my face from drying out while tanning and keeps it from getting greasy.  However, I think it would be better with stronger bronzers</li>
    <li> Just okay! I work at a tanning salon and wanted to try this out since we no longer have it. I was disappointed to find that it broke me out. I discontinued use and my face is just now clearing up! To be fair I only tried it once, so it might be worth a second shot as any breakout can be triggered for multiple reasons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this tiny little bottle for what feels like forever now. It&#x27;s such a great deal and you can&#x27;t beat Designer Skin when it comes to tanning products.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 2 star because I&#x27;ve only used it twice. Not to mention it expired October of last year. I tried it any way and I&#x27;m pretty sure it hasn&#x27;t worked. I had this bottle from the actual salon and even though it was $10 more it actually worked and wasn&#x27;t expired. It even smelled a little different. The one from the salon had kind of a plain smell whereas this one from Amazon smells like fragrance and chemicals and is even a little lighter than the actual one. It&#x27;s probably a fake. All sellers are different but this one is a fake</li>
    <li> doesnt make my skin oily, of course it smells a little funky..they all do. great gradual tanning product for everyday and tanning use</li>
    <li> this is the first time using this face lotion and it works great I have skin problems and brake out with every thing I&#x27;ve tryed untill I tryed this product so far no brake outs and its been all most six months,and I think I have a few more weeks left of the bottle I go six months ago a little gos a long way.</li>
    <li> I love the facial bronzer and I am in love with Designer Skin products. I cannot get enough of them.</li>
    <li> i like it but the smell is not good but i use it anyway</li>
    <li> Great lotion for face.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love the way this does not break me out,or feel to slimy on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;I have combo skin and seems to be helping with pores.&lt;br /&gt;You really need a bottle of this in your tanning rotation.</li>
    <li> Truly not a pore clogger which I appreciated. It helps with some color to my face without the harm chemicals most bronzers have now a days</li>
    <li> I am fair complected, have freckles and break out easily.  Usually when tanning my freckles come out before I start getting a tan. Not the case with this stuff.  After the 2nd visit to the tanning bed I could tell I was getting color to my face and my freckles are not getting darker just getting a nice even tan.  I was skeptical at first when I saw the bronze color because I am so fair complected but it went on easily was  not too dark for my face it looked natural.  It keeps your face moisturized all day and I have not suffered any breakouts from it (I have oily skin and for my face not to feel all greasy after wearing it all day and not breaking out from it is a MAJOR plus.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought several face tanning lotions, but this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t break me out. I have very sensitive acne prone skin, and this is ok for me! I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s getting my face extremely tan though, so I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars!</li>
    <li> I like it, but it will sometimes make my skin break out if I use it too much. Not exactly what I&#x27;m looking for since I tan to dry out my pimples, not create more. However, it does help my face become darker.</li>
    <li> This item is good. Doesn&#x27;t break me out and super thin. A little goes a long way. Makes my face glow!</li>
    <li> i cant stand this crap! It was so expensive for such a little bottle and it smells horrible. i used it one time and have never used since. I put it on and my face stunk for the rest of the day. Not a good product at all. Do Not Buy!</li>
    <li> I usually use my regular tanning lotion on my face but I tried this cuz it said it was good for sensitive skin. It didn&#x27;t break me out and got me really dark</li>
    <li> great face lotion with a bronzer. Helps skin tone too! one of the best ive used, buy it, product info is accurate and it was even better than i was expecting</li>
