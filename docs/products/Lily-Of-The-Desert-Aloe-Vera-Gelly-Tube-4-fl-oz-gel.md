      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I love the product and i loved the service.</li>
      <li>Well to my nice surprise it has helped to control my acne.  </li>
      <li>but it kind of dries sticky when used by itself.</li>
      <li>I liked this product.</li>
      <li>A lovely sight for sure!  </li>
      <li>I love everything about this except the smell.</li>
      <li>I have not had as many breakouts and it helps to speed up the healing when I do have a scar.  </li>
      <li>healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an interesting article about aloe vera that explained some of its healing properties.</li>
      <li>When i ordered the gelly it arrived about 3 days later in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>Until I have my own aloe plant or if I find a more natural product, I&#x27;ll use this gel.</li>
      <li>and it is light</li>
      <li>When i used it to smooth my hair before senegalese twists it worked perefectly</li>
      <li>but when i used it to smooth my edges it provided no hold.</li>
      <li>It is good for twists and bandu knots!!!&lt;br /&gt;A must get for those who has natural hair.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product that had only aloe in it, this was the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>Works great on super dry skin too!</li>
      <li>I have a mild sunburn now</li>
      <li>I mistakenly thought this item was covered under Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;super shipper savings\\&quot; heading.  </li>
      <li>I liked the fact that there weren&#x27;t too many other ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>This is the best Aloe Vera gel I&#x27;ve found so far though it has a few ingredients in it besides what is listed on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>So, I don&#x27;t blame the seller for the shipping cost, but was surprised when I saw that the price I paid was $5 more than I had anticipated.  </li>
      <li>(next time I&#x27;ll be sure to load on the sunblock).  </li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and makes the skin soft and pliable.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was supposed to be pure aloe vera</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Hmmm, so much conflicting information out there who knows what to believe.  </li>
      <li>The delivery time was reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I use this aloe very gel in the morning, evening and during the night so 2 or 3 times a day and it controls the swelling, redness, peeling, burning and itching quite well.  </li>
      <li>I really like it on my natural hair.  </li>
      <li>This product dry quickly on skin surface, and not sticky.</li>
      <li>It does leave my skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe vera is also very good for bad sunburns.</li>
      <li>Yet aloe plants thrive, because they have developed natural antibacterial qualities, to protect themselves.  </li>
      <li>So I began using natural products and this seems to work</li>
      <li>Their natural antibacterial action is part of what makes them so beneficial to people and pets when applied topically.</li>
      <li>The skin where the scab used to be is still pink and sensitive under it, so I&#x27;ll keep applying aloe very gel till it&#x27;s fully</li>
      <li>I have also been having a problem with adult acne and face oil since the big 40.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this from my local organic store to use as a facial moisturizer and to help clear my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Because it&#x27;s full of a moist gel inside, and grows in a hot climate, the aloe plant would (in theory) be extremely vulnerable to succumbing to a bacterial infection, if it got a nick or scratch.  </li>

    <li> The tube I have looks a bit different than the picture here but it is the same thing.  I have a mild sunburn now and I grabbed this (next time I&#x27;ll be sure to load on the sunblock).  It does leave my skin very soft.  This is the best Aloe Vera gel I&#x27;ve found so far though it has a few ingredients in it besides what is listed on Amazon.  Someone commented the company should post the ingredients so I have my tube sitting here with me and I&#x27;ll list them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certified organic aloe vera barbadensis juice (gel), lactobacillus/arundinaria gigantea extract (bamboo), glucose (preservative), carbomer (thickener), aloe barbadensis leaf polysaccharides (certified organic aloesorb), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), retinyl palmitate (vitamin a), ascorbic acid (vitamin c), phenoxyethanol (preservative), glucose oxidase (and) lactoperoxidase (preservative), sodium hydroxide (ph adjuster)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t phenoxyethanol alcohol?? I&#x27;ve \\&quot;heard\\&quot; that is BAD for sunburns?? Hmmm, so much conflicting information out there who knows what to believe.  Until I have my own aloe plant or if I find a more natural product, I&#x27;ll use this gel.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this except the smell. The texture and consistency is nice but this smells like stinky plastic or something like that!</li>
    <li> Like the scent, and not oily. I use on my face. Also on winter blister sores. This product dry quickly on skin surface, and not sticky. I did use Lily of the desert on a burn blister, I do believe it helped in healing. Good product.</li>
    <li> Have bumps on your legs after shaving? Just put this stuff on and they will instantly disappear! Works great on super dry skin too!</li>
    <li> I liked this product. I liked the fact that there weren&#x27;t too many other ingredients in it. I was looking for a product that had only aloe in it, this was the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> This item seems to be what was described.  I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but it appears to be what I ordered... just in a different looking tube.  The delivery time was reasonable.  The price was good, but the shipping cost exceeded the price of the item so I wouldn&#x27;t likely purchase this item again online.  I can&#x27;t complain about the seller.  I mistakenly thought this item was covered under Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;super shipper savings\\&quot; heading.  So, I don&#x27;t blame the seller for the shipping cost, but was surprised when I saw that the price I paid was $5 more than I had anticipated.  Not the \\&quot;deal\\&quot; I had expected.  I could get a similar product at Walmart for less than I paid with the shipping included for this item.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  Absorbs quickly and makes the skin soft and pliable.  I would recommend this product for good skin care.</li>
    <li> I use this product on the skin all around my eyes.  I have chronic lyme disease and the skin around my eyes - eyelids up the brow and the skin underneath the eyes to the cheekbone - itch, burn, swell, get very red and peel - it looks pretty bad and the burning/itching gets out of control if I do nothing.  A lovely sight for sure!  I use this aloe very gel in the morning, evening and during the night so 2 or 3 times a day and it controls the swelling, redness, peeling, burning and itching quite well.  It&#x27;s not perfect but it makes this issue very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologists and ophthalmologists and tried antibiotics etc to no avail.  So I began using natural products and this seems to work the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe vera is also very good for bad sunburns.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time with no complications. I love the product and i loved the service. Thanks</li>
    <li> I like this product but I found it cheaper elsewhere</li>
    <li> I fell and banged my knee a couple of weeks ago, and got a scab...... the scab just \\&quot;sat there\\&quot; looking the same for almost two weeks.... I put a big dab of Lily of the desert aloe vera gelly on it two days ago, and the scab is gone. I&#x27;m not sure of the mechanism, but the scab began shrinking and cleared up completely in about 1-1/2 days. The skin where the scab used to be is still pink and sensitive under it, so I&#x27;ll keep applying aloe very gel till it&#x27;s fully healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an interesting article about aloe vera that explained some of its healing properties. It&#x27;s a desert plant, and used the gel to soak up and hold in water when it rains (so it can survive the long dry spells between rains.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s full of a moist gel inside, and grows in a hot climate, the aloe plant would (in theory) be extremely vulnerable to succumbing to a bacterial infection, if it got a nick or scratch.  Yet aloe plants thrive, because they have developed natural antibacterial qualities, to protect themselves.  Their natural antibacterial action is part of what makes them so beneficial to people and pets when applied topically.</li>
    <li> Used this with jojoba oil and shea butter for homemade body wash.</li>
    <li> Burned my face when I used it. I thought it was supposed to be pure aloe vera but something in this burned my face and made it turn red when I used it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from my local organic store to use as a facial moisturizer and to help clear my skin tone.  I have also been having a problem with adult acne and face oil since the big 40.  Well to my nice surprise it has helped to control my acne.  I have not had as many breakouts and it helps to speed up the healing when I do have a scar.  I use it night and day.  Currently using it to help a body acne scar.  Great as a moisturizer and helps to control acne, score.</li>
    <li> I like it but it kind of dries sticky when used by itself. I use it as a nightime face moisturizer.  So i mix my jojoba oil/tea tree with it and idont get that sticky feeling as it dries</li>
    <li> I really like it on my natural hair.  It is good for twists and bandu knots!!!&lt;br /&gt;A must get for those who has natural hair.</li>
    <li> When i ordered the gelly it arrived about 3 days later in perfect condition. I planned on using this product as a hair gel but when i used it to smooth my edges it provided no hold. When i used it to smooth my hair before senegalese twists it worked perefectly and it is light so it didn&#x27;t cause any build up in my hair.</li>
