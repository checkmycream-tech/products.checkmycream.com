    <li> A FAV I have used for years...makes a difference. Surprised to see on Amazon, but grabbed it up due to price.  Great delivery. Glad to find a better price. This 1 oz is expensive on home shopping, but I pay it normally, because I love it.</li>
    <li> did not stand up to what i get from HSN.not a good product.</li>
    <li> The Sereious Skin Care C-Serum Vitamin C Ester Skin cinditioner has some good qualities. I use it for lightening my facial skin. This is a continuous treatment that works over time. Do to different skin types, some may experience a quicker response. There is no skin irritation with this product. It is a great moisturizer and helps to lighten wrinkled areas. This contains a stable form of Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay - but don&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
    <li> Started using SSC last year after I got Shingles.  The illness and the medicine really did a number on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is really good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this product, its the best Ive ever used but please be careful what you buy, its ridiculously high on HSN but go there to check out the packaging, when youre using these products its important to have the newest product you don&#x27;t want some that&#x27;s been sitting around for 3 years or longer the ingredients are no longer good after that amount of time. You can see what the newer packing looks like and I suggest you buy that not the other, I made that mistake and had to send it back. Its well worth paying a few dollars more for a fresh product.</li>
    <li> Product has a light fragrance and works well.  Easy to use bottle.  I love using this after I use my microneedler or retin A.</li>
    <li> This is a quality C-Serum. It has made a difference in the brightness and hydration of my skin. I had only been using it for a week when a friend commented on the look of my skin. I definitely recommend this product as I would Serious Skin Care products in general.</li>
    <li> I was first leery about purchasing this item. It was recommended that I start using Vitamin C to brighten my skin tone. This stuff has been amazing since my initial use. Word of advice: A LITTLE BIT GOES A VEEEEEERY LONG WAY!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this serum,it really does meet my expectations and then some.I would totally recommend this to people no matter your skin type.It&#x27;s a keeper,probably will order again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if this stuff does much for my skin.</li>
    <li> What a difference in my skin with the C line, hydrates the skin I have mature skin&lt;br /&gt;and it is dry</li>
    <li> Loved the product because it is so moisturizing and it really brightens my skin.  I have rosea and it is helping that also. Please continue offering this product at same or lower price.</li>
    <li> The item i received was only half full.  the lid was loose and most of the cream was in the bottom of the box.</li>
