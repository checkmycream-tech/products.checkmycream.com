      <li>still, it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I really like the idea of a product that works by vasodilation to create, naturally, your own unique perfect lip gloss.</li>
      <li>even this modest improvement is welcome.</li>
      <li>The color was soooo perfect, it was like the dream pink i&#x27;ve always been searching for but never knew existed.</li>
      <li>This really truely works!  </li>
      <li>It goes on your lips smooth, stays smooth, isn&#x27;t sticky like most glosses.  </li>
      <li>and I enjoy the color it creates.  </li>
      <li>this gloss is so great that I will open my wallet for it.</li>
      <li>Not too sticky or runny, pampers lips, transforms from clear to your own unique pink almost immediately, and fits perfectly in a purse, bag or wallet!</li>
      <li>This absolutely gives your lips the perfect pink color for your skin tone.</li>
      <li>Its color is bright enough to be used as a lipstick.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true for everyone</li>
      <li>and it looks just as gorgeous and totally different on their skin tone.</li>
      <li>Blank lips before, nice pink pretty perfect lips after!  </li>
      <li>I definitely love how this lip gloss gives my lips that natural pinkish glow!</li>
      <li>It is one dollar plus tax.....and is 0.27 ounces, only .07 ounces less than this product, and it is available for a great price!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear but turns to lovely color on the lips.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite lip gloss.</li>
      <li>and the result is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it, it takes your natural lip color and magnifies it with the gloss.</li>
      <li>This lip gloss is worth at max $1.00.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lip gloss by far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super sticky and glides on easily, giving a perfect pink pout.</li>
      <li>They should rename it to Smart Lips!</li>
      <li>and after one use my life felt smooth, soft, and hydrated!</li>
      <li>My lips are naturally fairly pink but this product produces a really beautiful colour and adds extra volume to boot!</li>
      <li>ready to go!</li>
      <li>For the price of this item (it&#x27;s more of a sample-size gloss), it deserves only two stars--barely--and here&#x27;s why:</li>
      <li>I will most definitely be purchasing this again!!</li>
      <li>It truely changed my lips to a natural color!  </li>
      <li>It really lives up to its word.</li>
      <li>I have too much makeup already.</li>
      <li>I gave it a few mintues, and really liked it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a special tube or extra large</li>
      <li>i gave this product 4 stars because it does exactly what it claims: it develops a shade according to your natural lip color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just a plain tube of lip gloss that does nothing more than what a cheaper gloss does.</li>
      <li>Then my daughter showed me this new thing from Smashbox.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for a natural looking lip.</li>
      <li>I use a natural coloured lipliner before applying O Gloss and voila!</li>
      <li>Which puts it on par with many other lip glosses--it would deserve a higher rating, perhaps, for being about average except for the fact that it claims to be a greater-than-average product.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be clear</li>
      <li>It is a clear gloss that brings out the natural pigments in your lips.</li>
      <li>Just lip gloss alone, I probably have enough to fill up the whole drawer.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t turn the lips a different color that much</li>
      <li>it is a ckear gloss, it brings out the natural color of your lips.</li>
      <li>It lasts pretty long too.</li>
      <li>Anything that&#x27;s TOO pink doesn&#x27;t work for my lips, but this product is like a smart phone!  </li>
      <li>Wet n Wild&#x27;s Fantasy Makers collection, and it is exactly the same thing....</li>
      <li>There is a little stinging when you first apply it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also moisturising and doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out at all even with frequent use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is great;not tacky and lasts a while. it does provide a hint of color and nice gloss</li>
    <li> Love this product. Give it try. It&#x27;s a really soft pink.</li>
    <li> i gave this product 4 stars because it does exactly what it claims: it develops a shade according to your natural lip color. the only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because i&#x27;m not completely pleased with the color that comes out on my lips. as the title of this review suggests, i have medium brown skin, and this gloss turns rosy-red. I was hoping for a naturally brighter pink, but that&#x27;s not the case. still, it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I definitely love how this lip gloss gives my lips that natural pinkish glow! It is a must-have on every cosmetics lover&#x27;s vanity kit!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite lip gloss. A little pricey but so qorth it. It&#x27;s not super dark but it still has some color &amp; feels nice. I don&#x27;t wear lipstick or anything but still want to have a little color on my lips &amp; this is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> I love this lip gloss.  It lasts forever and provides the perfect glossy shine without being sticky.</li>
    <li> Okay, I am a makeup junkie, and even more so a lip gloss junkie. I in no way needed any more makeup unitl I popped into my local Sephora and tried this gloss on. I gave it a few mintues, and really liked it. I walked around the store for a bit, and checked it out again. The color was soooo perfect, it was like the dream pink i&#x27;ve always been searching for but never knew existed. I let a bunch of my friends try it out for kicks, and it turned out a different shade every time. Yet it flattered everyone, even my friends with darker skin tones, who vow to never wear pink makeup. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it tends to dry my lips out. I don&#x27;t know if this is true for everyone but I am perpetually dehydrated so it could just be me. Fact is I always get compliments when I wear this gloss. I could never justify spending $22 on a lip gloss, but for this, I would buy it ten times over.</li>
    <li> I have too much makeup already. Just lip gloss alone, I probably have enough to fill up the whole drawer. So I decided NOT to buy any more until they were all used up. Then my daughter showed me this new thing from Smashbox. It&#x27;s clear but turns to lovely color on the lips. I tried it and fell in love. The color is perfect for my lips and my daughter&#x27;s. I thought it might be too sheer but it isn&#x27;t. Its color is bright enough to be used as a lipstick. I think it turns to the perfect shade according to your skin tone.     So needless to say, I had to get it. I like it not just for the color but also for the fact that my purse is lighter. Just one of these replaced lipstick and a gloss. I don&#x27;t even carry lipfusion anymore.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no valid reason to pay $25 for a tube of lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lipgloss doesn&#x27;t stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a special color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t condition your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a special tube or extra large size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a plain tube of lip gloss that does nothing more than what a cheaper gloss does. Every time my lip touched something it smeared. If I didn&#x27;t eat anything and walked around with my gloss on it just came off within a short amount of time for no reason. This lip gloss is worth at max $1.00.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t turn the lips a different color that much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it before and I enjoy the color it creates.  It is a bit drying but I use Lips2Kiss products to help with moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;ve never tried this lipgloss, but you should know that there is a lip gloss on the market called Magic Gloss which is distributed from Wet n Wild&#x27;s Fantasy Makers collection, and it is exactly the same thing....only cheaper!  It is one dollar plus tax.....and is 0.27 ounces, only .07 ounces less than this product, and it is available for a great price! I have not found it online but bought it at Shopko and have seen it at Walgreens-it is a GREAT gloss. Not too sticky or runny, pampers lips, transforms from clear to your own unique pink almost immediately, and fits perfectly in a purse, bag or wallet! Be warned though, that there really is no \\&quot;fun taste\\&quot; like with other lip glosses. (But at least this one doesn&#x27;t taste nasty, just bland!) You may want to hurry up to purchase it though, because it is only out on Halloween!</li>
    <li> This absolutely gives your lips the perfect pink color for your skin tone. I always get compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s not super sticky and glides on easily, giving a perfect pink pout. I&#x27;ve had friends try it on and it looks just as gorgeous and totally different on their skin tone.</li>
    <li> This really truely works!  I took before and after pics.  Blank lips before, nice pink pretty perfect lips after!  It truely changed my lips to a natural color!  Anything that&#x27;s TOO pink doesn&#x27;t work for my lips, but this product is like a smart phone!  They should rename it to Smart Lips!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation in a women&#x27;s magazine. I thought it would be clear but it turns my lips too pink.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip gloss by far. I absolutely love it, it takes your natural lip color and magnifies it with the gloss. I am always getting compliments on it. This is a great price and for me not living close to a Sephora an even better price considering I can have it shipped to my door with prime for free! I will most definitely be purchasing this again!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my O Gloss by smashbox.  It goes on your lips smooth, stays smooth, isn&#x27;t sticky like most glosses.  I would order from this company again.  My gloss arrived ahead of schedule.  It is  an amazing gloss,  it is a ckear gloss, it brings out the natural color of your lips.</li>
    <li> For the price of this item (it&#x27;s more of a sample-size gloss), it deserves only two stars--barely--and here&#x27;s why: I really like the idea of a product that works by vasodilation to create, naturally, your own unique perfect lip gloss. Which this does--immediately--but only lasts for a few minutes, and then it&#x27;s gone. Which puts it on par with many other lip glosses--it would deserve a higher rating, perhaps, for being about average except for the fact that it claims to be a greater-than-average product. It&#x27;s different, but not worth the hoopla it claims it deserves.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  Feels good without being gooey and colors the lips perfectly</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this plumper does work.  I have tried a few others and this is the only one that makes any difference at all.  There is a little stinging when you first apply it but it&#x27;s nothing and the result is worth it.  I have thin lips and even this modest improvement is welcome.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it claimed, except that it just wasn&#x27;t the best shade on me. I would recommend it anyway as I think the shade thing is more of a preference than anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this lipgloss. It really lives up to its word. I had chapped and dry lips and after one use my life felt smooth, soft, and hydrated! Also, the color turns out lovely. It is a clear gloss that brings out the natural pigments in your lips. I was addicted after one use.</li>
    <li> This lip gloss has turned me into a lipstick wearer. It feels great &amp; is the perfect shade of pink for everyone. I buy my makeup at Walmart, not Sephora but this gloss is so great that I will open my wallet for it. It lasts pretty long too.</li>
    <li> My wife was so happy I bought this for her as a gift but is sad as she is running out of it and as you can see it&#x27;s quite expensive for a lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Love this gloss/lip plumper- it produces a truly lovely effect. My lips are naturally fairly pink but this product produces a really beautiful colour and adds extra volume to boot! It lasts longer than similar products, isn&#x27;t gloopy and even after it&#x27;s worn off, my lips retain a natural looking pink shade. When I wake up the next day following use of the gloss, my lips are still a deeper pink. It&#x27;s also moisturising and doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out at all even with frequent use. I use a natural coloured lipliner before applying O Gloss and voila! ready to go! Highly recommend for a natural looking lip. Oh, and the tingling sensation is pleasant- certainly NOT painful as some reviewers report.</li>
