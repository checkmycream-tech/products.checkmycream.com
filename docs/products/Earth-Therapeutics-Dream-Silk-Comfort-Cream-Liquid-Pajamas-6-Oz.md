      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I am searching out more.</li>
      <li>I recently started using a couple of earth therapeutic products after discovering the brand and I have loved every one!</li>
      <li>A pea-sized amount will do just fine.  </li>
      <li>Thanks :)!</li>
      <li>softens skin is extremely light weight on skin and not greasy the scent is that of herbal mix and does not overpower.  </li>
      <li>It has a light lavender smell, which is not overpowering at all.  </li>
      <li>Silky and smooth</li>
      <li>the fragrance, thin shear texture, along with the best deal ever, I decided to purchase some more for myself and friends.....</li>
      <li>I have a great deal trouble sleeping with PTSD and Vigilance issues...</li>
      <li>and I get so many compliments on how soft my skin is...</li>
      <li>and I have the most baby soft feel by morning.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>Luckily I found this at a discount store and didn&#x27;t spend much on it.</li>
      <li>It took me a little while to adjust to the strong smell, but after the first few seconds it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
      <li>I only purchased it because it had such good reviews.</li>
      <li>It is not a heavy duty lotion that will work on very dry skin, but it is effective and lovely for daily moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It really relaxes you.</li>
      <li>You really have to work at it to get it to absorb.</li>
      <li>Really silky</li>
      <li>As for moisturizing, it&#x27;s definitely good, though not great.  </li>
      <li>This lotion feels odd going on, a little slippery, but it absorbs very well and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and lightly fragranced.</li>
      <li>The size is generous and with how little is needed, I can tell this will last a long time, although if it ever goes on sale I will stock up, even my husband, who is fragrance sensitive, likes the light scent of the lotion and spray.</li>
      <li>Some people think it&#x27;s too hard to rub in, but I assure you, it&#x27;s fine as long as you use a proper amount.  </li>
      <li>I rub this on and it immediately starts to calm me down, I do take other things with it</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m so confused after reading all these reviews. I am obsessed with bedtime lotions and am usually in awe when I find anything that can help me sleep but this stuff sucks! I only purchased it because it had such good reviews. I honestly am left wondering if there was something wrong with the bottle I received? I recently started using a couple of earth therapeutic products after discovering the brand and I have loved every one! My favorite by this brand is the intensive heel repair lotion with tea tree oil, it smells so amazing! It makes my feet feel wonderful and like I just left the spa every time I put it on. Okay, so my problem with this comfort cream is that it has NO scent! I literally even rubbed some on my face and I can not smell it! I was expecting some sort of lavender scent but nope, nothing! How the heck is this scent supposed to help me sleep when I can&#x27;t even smell anything after covering myself in this stuff? Oh well... I guess I&#x27;ll stick with my aromatherapy sleep lotion from bath and body works for now. Any suggestions on something else to try? Feel free to leave a comment on my review! Thanks :)!</li>
    <li> smells WONDERFUL!  softens skin is extremely light weight on skin and not greasy the scent is that of herbal mix and does not overpower.  definitely an upscale SPA product.</li>
    <li> Luckily I found this at a discount store and didn&#x27;t spend much on it. This has an awesome smell, much like the sleep aromatherapy spray. As a lotion, this stinks. Despite not being a thick cream, it was very hard to rub in. You really have to work at it to get it to absorb. And even then, the lotion was &#x27;rolling&#x27; on my skin in some places (I didn&#x27;t have any other products on my skin that might cause this). Not a &#x27;comforting&#x27; bed time routine.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream, because I liked the scent, I tried it and I get so many compliments on how soft my skin is...&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, keeps my skin soft, and has a calming effect.  Will keep using it for after shower and night time use.</li>
    <li> Someone told me about his cream and it does work.  It really relaxes you.</li>
    <li> I normally hate anything scented, especially lotions, but I absolutely love this stuff. It has a weird consistency and needs a lot of massaging into the skin, but it smells fabulous. Great for after bed-time baths.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  Not only does it feel great and smell great, it relaxes me and helps me to fall asleep.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels even better!!!  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> helps me sleep I put it on my feet</li>
    <li> I found a bit of this at a ROss and I have grown so fond of it I am searching out more. IT works!!!! I have a great deal trouble sleeping with PTSD and Vigilance issues...I rub this on and it immediately starts to calm me down, I do take other things with it but i have noticed they work more effectively and quicker when I use this product with them, I sleep deeper and longer as well/ Great product. I am going to buy for friends and family for presents. as for the lotion, I have dry skin and this is the smoothest and most luscious feeling lotion I have ever found. I love the texture,  the smell, and the htealeutic benefits.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion!  It took me a little while to adjust to the strong smell, but after the first few seconds it&#x27;s perfect.  Also, I&#x27;m not kidding when I say this stuff helps me sleep.  Lately I&#x27;ve been having lots of trouble settling down for the night, but with this I&#x27;m asleep within 20 minutes and sleep through the night.  It&#x27;s amazing!  Some people think it&#x27;s too hard to rub in, but I assure you, it&#x27;s fine as long as you use a proper amount.  A pea-sized amount will do just fine.  As for moisturizing, it&#x27;s definitely good, though not great.  I couple it with another moisturizer before bed, and it perfect!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream for my mom because she has alot of trouble sleeping because of leg pain. She had gotten this cream from someone else as a gift. It was bought at a store and now we can&#x27;t find it, so I used the on-line way to order it. She loves it and I also have used it and would order it again</li>
    <li> Great, was not sticky at all like some lotions.  Really silky just like it says.  Will purchase again if still avaliable.</li>
    <li> I had sent to my sister as a gift--she says it is wonderful--has trouble sleeping and this helps a lot!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the same scent as a pillow spray I use and I love it....it is creamy, smooth and feels wonderful on your skin! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has helped my child with autism sleep.  We had tried everything.  Melatonin did not work for him.  This Valerian stuff really works and it&#x27;s great that they put it in a lotion.  Now even when he won&#x27;t take his meds I can use the lotion and he can rest.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Silky and smooth, liquid pajamas is an apt name for it.  It has a light lavender smell, which is not overpowering at all.  It is not a heavy duty lotion that will work on very dry skin, but it is effective and lovely for daily moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I adore this lotion and use it every night in conjunction with the pillow spray. This lotion feels odd going on, a little slippery, but it absorbs very well and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and lightly fragranced. I also use this on my feet at bedtime and follow with a pair of Earth Therapeutics aloe socks and I have the most baby soft feel by morning.&lt;br /&gt;As someone who struggles with anxiety and insomnia, the Dream Silk lotion and the bedtime spray have done wonders in helping me relax and fall asleep faster. I never was big into aromatherapy but these products have made a believer out of me! The size is generous and with how little is needed, I can tell this will last a long time, although if it ever goes on sale I will stock up, even my husband, who is fragrance sensitive, likes the light scent of the lotion and spray.</li>
    <li> as advertised!  great soothing aroma</li>
    <li> I have trouble sleeping. A friend told me to try this. It&#x27;s AWESOME!!!!...the fragrance, thin shear texture, along with the best deal ever, I decided to purchase some more for myself and friends.....</li>
