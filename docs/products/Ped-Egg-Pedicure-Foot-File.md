<ol>
      <li>It fits perfectly in the palm of your hand.</li>

      <li>so it makes me happy that hes happy .-</li>
      <li>was great</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this purchase, it is a good price and does the job.</li>
      <li>It works well in or out of the shower and helps keep my feet nice.</li>
      <li>I bought the version with the handle, which is very easy to hold and use.</li>
      <li>The Ped Egg got rid of these quickly and painlessly, and my feet are no longer a danger to my socks or my loved ones.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I wish it was a better quality.</li>
      <li>You start buying more of the ilk.</li>
      <li>but with a more refined result.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>It mostly just roughens the skin on my feet and doesn&#x27;t take anything off.</li>
      <li>- make sure you put a trash can or a towel under your feet as you do this,</li>
      <li>As always, PedEgg is awesome... shipped on time with no problems and had no damage or anything.. would definitely order from these guys again</li>
      <li>there, all…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I begin with this review of this product, let me just start by saying what many of us already know--&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
      <li>I got a ped-egg from a store SEVERAL years ago and it worked great!</li>
      <li>pleased with this purchase..</li>
      <li>The teeth sand the skin more than shave it, which I have seen with a friend&#x27;s egg.</li>
      <li>This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how most of these miracle products live up to their name.</li>
      <li>It fits comfortably in your hand.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d not say dont get a ped egg, I will still order them, $6 a month to keep my feet looking smooth and it helps me walking and</li>
      <li>It appears that the original packaging was opened, brand name Ped Egg was removed and a CHEAP KNOCKOFF took</li>
      <li>I work on a remote island and the hot sand dries out my feet bottoms, this product allows me to use it easily, cleanly and with perfect</li>
      <li>Made very cheaply and doesn&#x27;t really do the job it advertizes.</li>
      <li>I bought this and am very happpy with the purchase and use it weekly to keep healthy and clean.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay for a bit of use, but it does not replace going to get a good pedicure, and the file looses its sharp quickly..</li>
      <li>This Ped Egg was not as good as the 2 others that  I have purchased at CVS in recent years.</li>
      <li>For those who have a need for the flakes (finer than the purest snow), this product is a true win-win.</li>
      <li>Fast, clean and easy clean up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The item arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>its great to keep up on the apearence of your feet year round.</li>
      <li>Having had really dry skin on my feet, I loved this when I first got it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is still a fair price for the ability if you are like me and a man with big feet who callouses a lot, you can save a lot of money doing your own feet and hygiene this way and its a very fast device .. but the blades on the first of my two is not very good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best tool ever for dry, rough skin.  </li>
      <li>I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  </li>
      <li>one point, they were only available by special order over the phone--now they&#x27;re for sale in stores like Walgreens, Longs Drugs and the like.</li>
      <li>Like many things I had tossed the packaging and unpacked the product and assembled it and did not pay mind to read if there was such a thing as a model # on the box.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one, however, was nothing like that first one I bought.</li>
      <li>MAke sure you buy extra blades</li>
      <li>Honestly, I think the only reason it took this long to come out is the salons of the world (as well as the mani-pedi industry itself) would take a huge plunge, if not go the way of the Saturday Morning cartoon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Honestly, I think the only reason it took this long to come out is the salons of the world (as well as the mani-pedi industry itself) would take a huge plunge, if not go the way of the Saturday Morning cartoon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can restore my feet to baby soft in a evening, soaking, scrubbing, using the sand paper side then lotion and clean socks</li>
      <li>/&gt;The whole idea and practice of the pedicure first originated in Egypt using rough&lt;br /&gt;stones</li>
      <li>The initial quality was fantastic, and it did the job as promised the first two times I used it.</li>
      <li>Great little gadget for ten bucks.  </li>
      <li>My only wish for improvement is that they would make available a mode; that was constructed of stronger metal</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this would work at all for my feet because the skin there is so much tougher.</li>
      <li>recommend if the price stays around $12-$15 to get one, and if you dont callous as much as i do you&#x27;ll probably have one longer.  </li>
      <li>I will say that I have intense callouses</li>
      <li>Absolutely not.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a bitch to buy, but once you do, you just wanna tell the whole world and praise the makers.</li>
      <li>anyone who wants cleaner, better-looking feet&lt;</li>
      <li>Everything about this product screams knock off, but since I got it for $5 Im just going to keep it and get a REAL one.</li>
      <li>My family tends to get calluses so hard that they start to peel off in spikes or scales; the odd thing is that the useful part of the calluses (on the bottom of the feet) is fine; these are on the sides of the foot where they wouldn&#x27;t even do any good when running around barefoot.    </li>
      <li>Poorly made could not get top to fit or couldn&#x27;t remove file from hand case.</li>
      <li>but they dont always carry each and every one of the decent</li>
      <li>I would definitely go with a better product next time and pay a little more if needed.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes of the pediegg.  </li>
      <li>I was a little nervous to try it at first, but it works just fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;BEWARE AND STEER CLEAR!!</li>
      <li>It is made of cheap plastic, not very sturdy at all.</li>
      <li>PED-EGG is one of those miracle-products that reallydo live up to the name.</li>
      <li>… “Cleaner”, Dane Youssefdo live up to the name.</li>
      <li>was a cheap non fitting version of the real thing garage I sent it back another fake of the real ped egg</li>
      <li>Rather than buy replacement blades, I went back to my $5 foot file, which lasted me much longer and was much cheaper to replace.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your time and money!</li>
      <li>I received this 4 days after ordering and opened it, it looked old and used.</li>
      <li>But Amazon.com will send it to you direct if you can&#x27;t leave the house or are living away from&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a professional manicure or pedicure.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nor am I planning on going professional.</li>
      <li>If you do, then expect a new one if this is the current norm of quality and size to be required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It barely works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not really the type who loves the whole &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; deal.</li>
      <li>bought this product because I developed not only athlete&#x27;s foot, but calluses as well</li>
      <li>The heels of my feet, my big toes, and right below my small toes on both feet were hard as rocks, and often turned spiky when I walked on a rough surface barefoot (ruined many socks).</li>
      <li>Blades do get dull quick.  </li>
      <li>The egg is a little hard to open, so sometimes shavings fly out because I have to pull so hard.</li>

<li> smaller, about the same price as the local store, within minor % but</li>
<li> My black one lasted nearly a year and in only 2 months the white one is no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the blades dulled quickly and I was unable to use it effectively after that.</li>
<li> have not yet opened my 2nd one but its amazing cutting is already dulling like my black one did after a year.</li>
<li> The 2 pieces of the Ped Egg did not snap together properly, so I have to hold it closed with my fingers.  </li>
<li> and it actually made it harder for me to dance.</li>
<li> so no mess of debris (the extracted dead foot skin) all over.</li>
<li> at a local drugstore i bought a black pedegg and really bought this one as they did not have a black one the day i ordered hoping to take the blades and refurb my black one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Completely doesn&#x27;t take the dead skin off, I hate it completely, the better choice is the Revlon.  </li>
<li> males associate pedicures and other related things with castration.</li>
<li> Works well for dry skin.  </li>
<li> The clear plastic packaging was dusty and old looking.  </li>
<li> All the thick dead skin, the calluses, corns, bunions, etc. are beneficial for a woman in advanced ballet--as insulation and padding against the harsh environment and nature of the toe</li>
<li> Only used it a few times.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not really all-too-easy cut your foot.</li>
<li> it tries to fall apart, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
<li> Not much of the shavings go into the container.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My family tends to get calluses so hard that they start to peel off in spikes or scales; the odd thing is that the useful part of the calluses (on the bottom of the feet) is fine; these are on the sides of the foot where they wouldn&#x27;t even do any good when running around barefoot.    The Ped Egg got rid of these quickly and painlessly, and my feet are no longer a danger to my socks or my loved ones.  I&#x27;d been using a pumice stone regularly, but it was insufficient to the task.    I bought the version with the handle, which is very easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> The rate of exfoliation rivals a butcher knife but with a more refined result. You will be amazed at the amount of heel powder this device will create in a few minutes of use. For those who have a need for the flakes (finer than the purest snow), this product is a true win-win.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes of the pediegg.  It works okay I felt like you had to sit and file for a really long time with little results.  I will say that I have intense callouses so that was probably the problem.</li>
    <li> at a local drugstore i bought a black pedegg and really bought this one as they did not have a black one the day i ordered hoping to take the blades and refurb my black one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its smaller, about the same price as the local store, within minor % but its smaller size is not good for someone who is a mens 13 like me.  Also the blades dont seem so hard to dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I store it properly and I am a user of this product before.  Like many things I had tossed the packaging and unpacked the product and assembled it and did not pay mind to read if there was such a thing as a model # on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is the one locally was great but they dont always carry each and every one of the decent seen it on tv type products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im very sad if pedegg has cheapened their manufacturing.. My black one lasted nearly a year and in only 2 months the white one is no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is still a fair price for the ability if you are like me and a man with big feet who callouses a lot, you can save a lot of money doing your own feet and hygiene this way and its a very fast device .. but the blades on the first of my two is not very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d not say dont get a ped egg, I will still order them, $6 a month to keep my feet looking smooth and it helps me walking and all kinds of things to have callous tissue removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thats why I end up at 3*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend if the price stays around $12-$15 to get one, and if you dont callous as much as i do you&#x27;ll probably have one longer.  If you do, then expect a new one if this is the current norm of quality and size to be required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet opened my 2nd one but its amazing cutting is already dulling like my black one did after a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this and am very happpy with the purchase and use it weekly to keep healthy and clean. I work on a remote island and the hot sand dries out my feet bottoms, this product allows me to use it easily, cleanly and with perfect results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought other types before from other Mall Stores but this is the best one. Fast, clean and easy clean up. I can restore my feet to baby soft in a evening, soaking, scrubbing, using the sand paper side then lotion and clean socks and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this seller and this product equally I will recommend it to all people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thaiville</li>
    <li> Having had really dry skin on my feet, I loved this when I first got it. It works well in or out of the shower and helps keep my feet nice.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;THE MIRACLE PRODUCT INVENTORS HAVE DONE IT AGAIN... THEY BROUGHT US... A MIRACLE.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Dane Youssef&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey there, all…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I begin with this review of this product, let me just start by saying what many of us already know--&lt;br /&gt;Most males associate pedicures and other related things with castration. Or immediate emasculation. I&#x27;ve always said, &amp;#34;I never will. Never set toe in one of those places. Absolutely not.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really the type who loves the whole &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; deal. I often feel out of place. I&#x27;ve never had a professional manicure or pedicure. I&#x27;ve never wanted to. There&#x27;s something about those places that just... doesn&#x27;t seem like my element. To add further distaste, I&#x27;ve always found that smell in there--the alcohol, the chemicals, the products to be distasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But eventually, I had to. You see, I have been taking classical ballet for about eight years now. And I&#x27;ve performed on-stage about six times. And when you work out in something like ballet, it&#x27;s just a matter of time before you develop athlete&#x27;s foot. No really, you can set your watch to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ballet dancers are renown for contracting some of the worst problems to their bodies not only because ballet is so physically demanding, but because improper training can be lethal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I am not a female (no offense, ladies! Don&#x27;t hate me!), so I&#x27;ve never actually taken Pointe classes. No toe work for this guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor am I planning on going professional. But these courageous women who have taken up the practice of Pointe-work have had their feet mutilated, and it is strictly forbidden to pedicure in any way because al that is gruesome about an untended foot helps in Pointe work. All the thick dead skin, the calluses, corns, bunions, etc. are beneficial for a woman in advanced ballet--as insulation and padding against the harsh environment and nature of the toe shoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I developed not only athlete&#x27;s foot, but calluses as well and it actually made it harder for me to dance. I had trouble working the floor foot-wise. So what I did was order this thing (which at the time, was not sold in stores. Gee, if only I waited. There&#x27;s a lesson there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything the ad boasted was true--it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive. It fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. There&#x27;s a filer so no mess of debris (the extracted dead foot skin) all over. It&#x27;s not really all-too-easy cut your foot. Like hair clippers with comb attachments, it never lets you go that far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callused heels can tear your socks, your pantyhose, your tights. The dead skin catches ahold of the material and damages it. It&#x27;s maddening. And annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s nothing to say of how insanely itchy it is. To the point that you&#x27;ll actually want to hack your foot off with a rusty butter-knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody whose even looking at this page knows what the hell I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point, they were only available by special order over the phone--now they&#x27;re for sale in stores like Walgreens, Longs Drugs and the like. A mere $9.99. I recommend this product for... well, if you&#x27;re reading this page, odds are--it&#x27;s the miracle thing you&#x27;re looking for. But Amazon.com will send it to you direct if you can&#x27;t leave the house or are living away from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how most of these miracle products live up to their name. They&#x27;re a bitch to buy, but once you do, you just wanna tell the whole world and praise the makers. You start buying more of the ilk. You become a life-long member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To anyone who wants cleaner, better-looking feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole idea and practice of the pedicure first originated in Egypt using rough&lt;br /&gt;stones over the soles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salons and basic foot files may have become as obsolete as powdered wigs and gas-powered lamps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PED-EGG is one of those miracle-products that reallydo live up to the name. Honestly, I think the only reason it took this long to come out is the salons of the world (as well as the mani-pedi industry itself) would take a huge plunge, if not go the way of the Saturday Morning cartoon.&lt;br /&gt;I’m telling you all—don’t even bother with beauty parlors and foot files anymore. Like… ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t bother. Not ever again. You don’t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Feeling… “Cleaner”, Dane Youssefdo live up to the name.

    <li> I actually purchased this for my calluses on my hands from CrossFit.  I do a lot of lifting and pull-ups, and this works well without ripping apart my hands.  I do wish it was slightly sharper because I have to scrub REALLY hard on my hands.  I don&#x27;t think this would work at all for my feet because the skin there is so much tougher.</li>
    <li> just got the ped egg It is alright, does the job well. Only used it a few times. pleased with this purchase..e</li>
    <li> This is the best tool ever for dry, rough skin.  It fits comfortably in your hand.  I use it all the time on my heels.</li>
    <li> Omg gross! The package is completely beat up and dirty. Not to mention it is OPENED!!!! I compared this to my REAL Ped Egg and this one is indeed a horrible knock off! It appears that the original packaging was opened, brand name Ped Egg was removed and a CHEAP KNOCKOFF took it&#x27;s place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE AND STEER CLEAR!! Do not waste your time and money!</li>
    <li> It is made of cheap plastic, not very sturdy at all. Not much of the shavings go into the container. I don&#x27;t like it. Not what I expected at all.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Ped Egg products.  I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  My only warning is that I would recommend to use it over a towel or tub because not 100% of the filings get caught by the case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a Ped Egg.  It&#x27;s a knock off, so the product advertisement is a lie.  It works okay, I guess, but it&#x27;s not a Ped Egg as advertised.</li>
    <li> Made very cheaply and doesn&#x27;t really do the job it advertizes. I would definitely go with a better product next time and pay a little more if needed.  I hate giving anyone a bad review, but this item really wasn&#x27;t worth the money or the effort.</li>
    <li> He had the product years ago, and he always wanted another low and behold..... Amazon found it!&lt;br /&gt;so hes a happy camper so it makes me happy that hes happy .- Tracie Robinson Davis of Signal Hill.</li>
    <li> Totally works to get all that nasty dead skin off!</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly.  The clear plastic packaging was dusty and old looking.  The 2 pieces of the Ped Egg did not snap together properly, so I have to hold it closed with my fingers.  This Ped Egg was not as good as the 2 others that  I have purchased at CVS in recent years.</li>
    <li> Being in my late teens, I was always embarrassed to have such hard and rough feet, I hated to wear sandals or walk around barefoot. The heels of my feet, my big toes, and right below my small toes on both feet were hard as rocks, and often turned spiky when I walked on a rough surface barefoot (ruined many socks). I tried this and after 5 minutes of using it on both feet, they instantly felt softer. It&#x27;s quick and painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s only one drawback - make sure you put a trash can or a towel under your feet as you do this, cause over ½ of the dead skin coming off doesn&#x27;t go into the ped egg, it goes onto the floor.</li>
    <li> My only wish for improvement is that they would make available a mode; that was constructed of stronger metal so I would NEVER have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Poorly made could not get top to fit or couldn&#x27;t remove file from hand case.</li>
    <li> Works well for dry skin.  Blades do get dull quick.  Great little gadget for ten bucks.  MAke sure you buy extra blades</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay for a bit of use, but it does not replace going to get a good pedicure, and the file looses its sharp quickly..</li>
    <li> As always, PedEgg is awesome... shipped on time with no problems and had no damage or anything.. would definitely order from these guys again</li>
    <li> The initial quality was fantastic, and it did the job as promised the first two times I used it. Unfortunately, the blades dulled quickly and I was unable to use it effectively after that. Rather than buy replacement blades, I went back to my $5 foot file, which lasted me much longer and was much cheaper to replace.</li>
    <li> It barely works. It mostly just roughens the skin on my feet and doesn&#x27;t take anything off. Also if it did catch anything, it is incredibly difficult to take it apart to empty it.</li>
    <li> anyone who has never owned one should invest in one. its great to keep up on the apearence of your feet year round.</li>
    <li> This product was a fake and of very poor quality. I would NOT recommend purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> The ped egg does its job. I wish it was a better quality. I was a little nervous to try it at first, but it works just fine. The egg is a little hard to open, so sometimes shavings fly out because I have to pull so hard.</li>
    <li> Product was partially open and severely damaged on the inside packaging. Not even usable.</li>
    <li> Package was damaged and the product looked rusted.  Didn&#x27;t even get to use...</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving this a star is because I believe it is required. Everything about this product screams knock off, but since I got it for $5 Im just going to keep it and get a REAL one. But dont be like me. Dont waste your time or your money. Ps. Not all knockoffs are completely useless, but this is. Trust me.</li>
    <li> Le saque todo el provecho a mi producto. Me gusto esta compra. La entrega fue bastante rápida. Todavia tengo repuestos para usar.</li>
    <li> The teeth sand the skin more than shave it, which I have seen with a friend&#x27;s egg. Maybe it&#x27;s a knockoff?</li>
    <li> I got it and the package looked so dirty like ,I didn&#x27;t even want to touch it. But once I got it opened, the ped egg looked fake. Also it doesn&#x27;t even get the dead skin off. Waste of money. It&#x27;s fake, not the real deal.</li>
    <li> I ordered this ped egg and hav always wanted one and it arrived way before the estimated delivery date that&#x27;s why I gave it a two. I received this 4 days after ordering and opened it, it looked old and used. looked as if it was repackaged. the ped egg was dirty. the product don&#x27;t even stay together. evry time I move it it tries to fall apart, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Terrible. The package was half-way open when I received the product, so I was upset even before I used it. Things went downhill even faster, however, when I actually did use the product. It does not work AT ALL - just somewhat smooths out your skin. I got a ped-egg from a store SEVERAL years ago and it worked great! This one, however, was nothing like that first one I bought. I don&#x27;t know if it was a fake that was placed in the ped-egg packaging (maybe that&#x27;s why it was opened when I got it in the mail?).. I don&#x27;t know. But I do not recommend buying this product here at all.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase, it is a good price and does the job. I recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Completely doesn&#x27;t take the dead skin off, I hate it completely, the better choice is the Revlon.  Horrible product.</li>
    <li> was a cheap non fitting version of the real thing garage I sent it back another fake of the real ped egg</li>
