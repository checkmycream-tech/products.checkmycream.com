### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great decision!  </li>
      <li>great shade, colors evenly.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>As mentioned by many others it turns your hair and scalp orange!!</li>
      <li>IT LEAVES THE GRAY ROOTS BRIGHT COPPER AND THE REMAINDER OF THE HAIR JET BLACK????????&lt;br /&gt;THE COLOR PACKET</li>
      <li>Use it if you have a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; complexion but don&#x27;t if you have a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; one; there are better browns suited for warm skin tones.</li>
      <li>I loved the older version, it beautifully colored my hair, and it made my hair silky smooth and healthy.    </li>
      <li>I was really pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love the old version of your medium brown color.  </li>
      <li>A GREAT BIG THANK YOU to AMAZON, and the Clairol!!!  </li>
      <li>when I decided to see if I could order it online and found out I could,  I was so excited...</li>
      <li>Like it more than the warm brown as that made my hair brassy red</li>
      <li>I grabbed this in Clove (medium cool brown).</li>
      <li>THE PRODUCT IS CLOVE MEDIUM COOL BROWN</li>
      <li>True to color.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m done, I can still see where the grays were, and it doesn&#x27;t look a whole lot better.</li>
      <li>It was so easy to use and fast!  </li>
      <li>Have been using this for years and am glad to find the particular color</li>
      <li>I have a very pale complexion (&amp;#34;cool blue&amp;#34;) and this is the perfect hair color for me.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite color (clove) and matches my natural color</li>
      <li>not only do I get my favorite shade cheaper than I had been paying for it</li>
      <li>Overall one of the favorite self-coloring brands.</li>
      <li>It was also my first time coloring my hair at home, and it was a piece of cake.  </li>
      <li>I used Natural Instincts #24 Clove Medium Cool Brown last night, and I am in love with the new color.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why Clairol changed a previously well liked product.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions precisely and left it in for 20 minutes (the maximum time).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping the color doesn&#x27;t fade too quickly as I really like it.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
      <li>When I washed it out my hair was evenly toned, soft, and shiny and exactly the color I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other medium brown shades from Clairol, and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>On top of it, the newer formula dries out your hair and does not last as long.  </li>
      <li>I have a cool skin tone, and my hair is naturally dark blonde / light brown and washed out looking.  </li>
      <li>My hair is healthy and shiny after using this product for the past 3 years.</li>
      <li>I wanted a change but not the same old highlights I used to get, so I went darker for the first time.  </li>
      <li>I got into the shower to rinse and condition, and I had no problem getting it to rinse clear.  </li>
      <li>OR MAYBE THIS IS JUST OLD STOCK</li>
      <li>I have used clairol Natural Instincts for about 15 years...</li>
      <li>looks shiny and natural.</li>
      <li>It faded considerably within a week of frequent washing, however, while still maintaining coverage of the gray.</li>
      <li>It does make my hair a dark and cool brunette</li>
      <li>It only took only 10 minutes compared to the normal 30-40 minutes!</li>
      <li>I am not willing to pay the extra money for the product&#x27;s change to include the color fresh packet.</li>
      <li>I accidentally dyed my hair too light and needed to take it down a few notches.</li>

<li> Unfortunately, the instructions aren&#x27;t very clear on this and don&#x27;t specify exactly when to start timing.</li>
<li> I have moved to a small town/rural area of Missouri and had difficulty locating this particular shade...</li>
<li> Because my hair was very dry and porous from my recent overdye disaster, I put in a protein filler (which you can buy on here or at Sally&#x27;s) and then dyed my hair with this.</li>
<li> so it came out very dark, and will wash out a little more slowly.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t leave your hair dry or brittle.</li>
<li> It did cover the gray, in fact, the entire color was too dark.</li>
<li> THE UNGRAY HAIR JET BLACK AND THE GRAY ROOTS REMAIN GRAY.??????????  </li>
<li> black*</li>
<li> After going through all the trouble, the results were not worth it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m diisappointed that what I received was not a true reflection of what was represented in the on-line description.</li>
<li> The color itself has faded a little bit after about three weeks, but that&#x27;s about the amount of time it is advertised to stay</li>
<li> It&#x27;s missing the 2-week refresh color packets.</li>
<li> The process of using this product was messy, time consuming, and smelly.</li>
<li> different colors behind it !</li>
<li> IT DOESNT UNLESS YOU LEAVE IT ON YOUR HAIR PAST</li>
<li> I purchased Clove, medium ash brown, and used it to cover a small amount of gray.</li>
<li> Having forgotten about my prior failed use of this product, I tried it again and started timing it after all the dye was applied, rather than as soon as the dye started to get applied.</li>
<li> I also did not leave any color behind on the pillowcase while I slept.  </li>
<li> Based on all the other reviews I just threw away the booster packet, I assume it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
<li> Why on earth did you change the formula, with that stupid 2 week refresher that turns your hair reddish?  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Have been using this for years and am glad to find the particular color</li>
    <li> To Clariol    I love, love, love the old version of your medium brown color.  Why on earth did you change the formula, with that stupid 2 week refresher that turns your hair reddish?  On top of it, the newer formula dries out your hair and does not last as long.  Please go back to the oringal formulas, please!!!!!  I loved the older version, it beautifully colored my hair, and it made my hair silky smooth and healthy.    GO Back to Orginal Version, or else this customer will leave you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m diisappointed that what I received was not a true reflection of what was represented in the on-line description. It&#x27;s missing the 2-week refresh color packets.</li>
    <li> Can depend on ongoing delivery of the product and it save travel time and gas to shop for it when needed.</li>
    <li> I used Natural Instincts #24 Clove Medium Cool Brown last night, and I am in love with the new color.  I have a cool skin tone, and my hair is naturally dark blonde / light brown and washed out looking.  I wanted a change but not the same old highlights I used to get, so I went darker for the first time.  Great decision!  It was also my first time coloring my hair at home, and it was a piece of cake.  I got into the shower to rinse and condition, and I had no problem getting it to rinse clear.  I also did not leave any color behind on the pillowcase while I slept.  I&#x27;m hoping the color doesn&#x27;t fade too quickly as I really like it.  I plan on staying a a brunette a while, but I like the idea of using demi-permanent to avoid drastic roots.</li>
    <li> I purchased Clove, medium ash brown, and used it to cover a small amount of gray. Now that I&#x27;m done, I can still see where the grays were, and it doesn&#x27;t look a whole lot better. The process of using this product was messy, time consuming, and smelly. After going through all the trouble, the results were not worth it. I followed the directions precisely and left it in for 20 minutes (the maximum time). I won&#x27;t be tempted to try this product again. UPDATE: Having forgotten about my prior failed use of this product, I tried it again and started timing it after all the dye was applied, rather than as soon as the dye started to get applied. Unfortunately, the instructions aren&#x27;t very clear on this and don&#x27;t specify exactly when to start timing. It did cover the gray, in fact, the entire color was too dark. It faded considerably within a week of frequent washing, however, while still maintaining coverage of the gray. It corrected the brassy colors from a permanent dye job. Unless I forget, I would not purchase this product again because it ended up being darker than the package represented.</li>
    <li> Great product. Don&#x27;t leave your hair dry or brittle. My hair is healthy and shiny after using this product for the past 3 years. True to color.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SUPPOSED TO COVER GRAY IT DOESNT UNLESS YOU LEAVE IT ON YOUR HAIR PAST THE RECOMMENDED PROCESS TIME WHICH MAKES THE UNGRAY HAIR JET BLACK AND THE GRAY ROOTS REMAIN GRAY.??????????  MY HAIR IS BROWN THE PRODUCT IS CLOVE MEDIUM COOL BROWN&lt;br /&gt; IF YOU LEAVE IT ON LONGER  THAN THE RECOMMENDED  TIME IT LEAVES THE GRAY ROOTS BRIGHT COPPER AND THE REMAINDER OF THE HAIR JET BLACK????????&lt;br /&gt;THE COLOR PACKET SHOULD BE THROWN OUT IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR RED LIKE A CIRCUS CLOWN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTF IS CLAIROL THINKING  OR MAYBE THIS IS JUST OLD STOCK THEY ARE PUSHING ON THE PUBLIC TO GET RID OF IT. WAS THIS PRODUCT MADE IN THE UNITED STATES PROBABLY NOT.&lt;br /&gt;CLAIROL SHOULD BE ASHAMED WHAT A RIP OFF</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have never had a problem getting the desired results.</li>
    <li> I am not willing to pay the extra money for the product&#x27;s change to include the color fresh packet. As mentioned by many others it turns your hair and scalp orange!! I don&#x27;t know why Clairol changed a previously well liked product. It also now contains peroxide.</li>
    <li> Not what it said it was they put one of the color I wanted and different colors behind it !</li>
    <li> I have a very pale complexion (&amp;#34;cool blue&amp;#34;) and this is the perfect hair color for me. I&#x27;ve tried other medium brown shades from Clairol, and this one is by far my favorite. It does make my hair a dark and cool brunette but it does not turn it *black* as I&#x27;ve heard others say. Use it if you have a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; complexion but don&#x27;t if you have a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; one; there are better browns suited for warm skin tones. The color itself has faded a little bit after about three weeks, but that&#x27;s about the amount of time it is advertised to stay so I can&#x27;t really complain. Overall one of the favorite self-coloring brands.</li>
    <li> great shade, colors evenly.  I left it on for over 30 minutes so it came out very dark, and will wash out a little more slowly.  looks shiny and natural. hair does not feel too damaged.</li>
    <li> I have used clairol Natural Instincts for about 15 years...this is my favorite color (clove) and matches my natural color amazinly well.  I have moved to a small town/rural area of Missouri and had difficulty locating this particular shade...when I decided to see if I could order it online and found out I could,  I was so excited...not only do I get my favorite shade cheaper than I had been paying for it retail...I don&#x27;t have to drive all over the place looking for it!!! A GREAT BIG THANK YOU to AMAZON, and the Clairol!!!  ~Jeni Seitz, 2nd Grade Teacher, El Dorado Springs, MO</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with this product. It didn&#x27;t smell at all. It was so easy to use and fast!  It only took only 10 minutes compared to the normal 30-40 minutes!</li>
    <li> I could not find this color in the store.  Like it more than the warm brown as that made my hair brassy red</li>
    <li> I accidentally dyed my hair too light and needed to take it down a few notches. I grabbed this in Clove (medium cool brown). Because my hair was very dry and porous from my recent overdye disaster, I put in a protein filler (which you can buy on here or at Sally&#x27;s) and then dyed my hair with this.
