    <li> the product itself is as described.&lt;br /&gt;but it smells worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I have two softner sheets inside it now, not helping.</li>
    <li> Have used this bag 2 times and it is falling apart. Would not recommend it, poor quality.</li>
    <li> Good zippers can be a pain at times, but pleased</li>
    <li> 2 of the zippers were broken when it arrived and one of the pockets was torn. Was expecting low quality based on the price, but was hoping for usable.</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad for Christmas and he LOVES it!</li>
    <li> I am having to return it for a refund due to it arriving with a broken zipper. Not a quality item amd disappointed with it since it was a Christmas gift to my boyfriend. Was so embarrassed as was defective.</li>
    <li> It has compartments and some room but how much room it has is deceiving.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t put very much in this kit and expect it to work well. When I hung it up on the door the fabric ripped, the zipper ran off the track, and the hook nearly came out as well. I recommend you keep checking online for better options.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for my boyfriend and my son. They are roomy, look classic and hold a lot of stuff.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Product display was exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner. Great job</li>
    <li> So far it works great and holds everything I need it to. Zippers seem low quality but haven&#x27;t had any problems yet. Great purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and the person was well please with</li>
    <li> This was a gift to a young man.  He said that it is perfect for his travels.</li>
    <li> Looks good, front clip didnt clip. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Everything about is is great EXCEPT it SMELLS!!&lt;br /&gt;Like gasoline or strong paint thinner !!???</li>
    <li> Somewhat large but did not experience problems so far with it. This poach certainly holds all the toiletry I need for travel from the shaving foam bottle to the toothbrush and paste to ... it has some padding and as a side note, I had glass spray bottles of men perfume and the poach was in my soft travel bag checked-in and nothing broke (with no special care). The hanging hook seems flaky however (fully loaded, it feels that something is going to break) but apart from that, I think I liked it as I used to carry things in plastic bags :-) so this is a big improvement over my disorganized scheme. I would rate between OK to like it and went for the higher rating.</li>
    <li> Fits my travel bottles and what not. Can even fit most of my bathroom items at home too. The one major issue I have is the zippers VERY flimsy. They didn&#x27;t rip but you have to be careful zipping them up. If you are always running late for flights I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this due to fast zipping might break the zipper. Recommend this but be gentle and don&#x27;t over stuff.</li>
    <li> Not worth a penny. I put my toiletries in it, walked to the bathroom, opened it, and fo7nd a pocket ripped. Zipped it back up, and the zipper broke.</li>
    <li> Just an observation here but.... If this is a &amp;#34;Mens&amp;#34; toiletry bag, then what&#x27;s up with Revlon red Nail polish and and Dora the explorer toothpaste inside the pouch?</li>
    <li> Zipper is already getting stuck after 1st use. Material is a cheap crappy pleather. It would be ok if it were smaller. It just feels weak, and doesn&#x27;t stay open like it should. Some of the compartments hang at an odd level.</li>
