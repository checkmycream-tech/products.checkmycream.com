<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> first of all, the bottle is so small. I was shocked. And it smells horrible and doesn&#x27;t do a good job of leaving it luminuos at all.</li>
    <li> It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It works pretty well but still I expected a little bit more product.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots and lots of face products but never had anything that changed the texture and look of my skin like this.  Upon application I felt this smooth soft texture which made it perfect for a light foundation.  I have been a user for 7 years of the mineral foundations but i got tired of never having a soft luminous look.  Except for a light touch of mineral cover to set, i will never go back to that look! I have always had oily skin and worried about clogging pores but this does not cause skin problems.</li>
    <li> I agree with both of the reviews posted to date. I&#x27;ve found that this primer does give my skin a nice \\&quot;glow.\\&quot; It also gives my makeup staying power...it often looks almost as good at night as it did at the beginning of the day. I highly recommend it, but not from Amazon! I&#x27;m really confused at their price of $24.99. I&#x27;ve bought this same product (and the same size bottle) from both Ulta and CVS...for $9.99.</li>
    <li> For those of you who thought it was \\&quot;too glittery\\&quot;, it could be that you used too much. I use just a little dab and that smooths over my whole face. I don&#x27;t experience any problems with greasiness or too much glitter. Just a nice, subtle glow under my makeup. As they say, a little dab will do ya!  That being said, I wanted to let those of you who love this product know that you can get it at [...] for the regular 9.95 price, plus free shipping over 25 bucks. I just put in an order myself, after searching everywhere for a decent price for this stuff. You can&#x27;t even buy it on the Sally [...] website, I don&#x27;t know if they quit making it or just quit supporting it. Anyway, go over to [...] and put in your order before it&#x27;s all gone!</li>
    <li> I first ordered this product from Drugstore.com because it was only available online.  I recently ordered another bottle online but then found that CVS drug stores carried the primer as well as other Sally Hansen makeup products.  I have used the primer, airbrush makeup, concealer, cream blush, and bronzer. I really like this line of beauty products. All the items at CVS were in the $9.99 to $11.99 range and CVS had them on sale - buy one get one free.  So imagine my surprise when I saw that Amazon priced the primer alone for $29.00.  I am disappointed because I trusted Amazon to have fair and equitable pricing.  I will not make that assumption in the future.</li>
    <li> I came here to see if I could add it to some other orders.  Price is okay.  But I LOVE the product.  Makes my (older) skin feel good and my makeup to go on so smoothly.  I used to buy a similiar product from Elizabeth Arden and it was about $50 a bottle.  I was thrilled with Carmindy came out with this product, and at such a reasonable price.  However, in our area we cannot buy it in any stores, so have to get it from the internet.    My only complaint would be that the pump runs out before the bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> I noticed ULTA and CVS pharmacy are temporarily out of stock on this item so decided to check my favorite site-Amazon.com-and was shocked at the price. Why is it so high here when the aforementioned sites sell it for less than $10.00 for the same size bottle? Thanks, but no thanks. I&#x27;ll wait.</li>
    <li> This product is illuminating only because they put glitter in it! It is greasy, feels very cheap. I broke out immediately. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t bling and I don&#x27;t know if it primes.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Gives your skin an amazing glow!!! Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;m Stephanie not Jim ;)  Second off...  This stuff is terrible!  VERY glittery!  I mean I love glitter I really do, but not all over my face!  Very disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product online, but I really like the way this stuff feels. It is very lightweight as long as you don&#x27;t go overboard with it. The scent is very light and it makes your skin look and feel so smooth. Provides an excellent base for the rest of your makeup. If you put too much on, you will look like you got hit in the face with Tinkerbell&#x27;s bag of fairy dust.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, not sticky, fine base for foundation, lasts all day. Especially good on my dry skin.will order again.</li>
    <li> CVS sells this for $9.99 and on sale for $7.99.  Perhaps $26.99 is a typo?</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I order 3 at a time. I have checked this out everywhere online and this is the very best price you will find. Makes my makeup go on like silk. Puts a bit of sparkle that I just love. I hope Sally Hansen never discontinues this!!!</li>
    <li> Applicator isn&#x27;t made correctly.  There should be soft bristles instead of a hard piece of plastic that hurts when using..  Actual product doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of luminizing or highlighting.  Waste of money,</li>
    <li> Product is great but the pump on the bottle quit working after only a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m paying $9.99 for this at CVS.  I don&#x27;t understand the Amazon pricing.  It better be a quart for that price.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the pump stopped working and so I have to get the primer out of the bottle with a q-tip. This is inconvienient.</li>
    <li> I used to watch Carmindy on What Not to Wear. She is a fabulous make-up artist and manages to make women look their best without being over done. I tried many of her products in the line she had with Sally Hansen and they were great. Her lipsticks and blush were long lasting, low priced and very hydrating. This face primer is the best I have found. It is incredibly hydrating, smooths out fine lines and has an illuminating quality that makes my face look healthy and glowing. Unfortunately, I think this whole line has been discontinued and I have been paying more and more as the last of the stock runs out. I hope they reconsider making her products. They just need better marketing since it was hard to find which stores carried them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just oil with some glitter thrown in. Does not work as a primer - a moisturizer maybe. No good. Leaves skin oily with a few sparkles here and there. It does not look good.</li>
    <li> Trying to beat this product out of the bottle is a drag. I&#x27;m not wanting to mess with mailing it back so I&#x27;ll just deal with it.</li>
    <li> The item is no longer made but I read a rave review about it and wanted to try it. Not so great.</li>
    <li> I bought tis item because I&#x27;d seen something like it used on What Not To Wear and Carmindy said it was good for older skin to help give a more youthful glow.  I was hoping that&#x27;s what this would do, but what I got was a product that doesn&#x27;t even come out of the container properly (the tube that goes into the product is too short for the container) and it just feels slippery on my face and does nothing really to improve my complexion.  I think using moisturizer under my makeup is much better and I  wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  I think it was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I like it but it is difficult to get the product out of the pump bottle. It has a really smooth feel to it. it came quickly, thank you.</li>
    <li> Nice product for special evening occasions, however, I probably will not use this for everyday wear.  Tends to have more sparkle rather that a pure luminous look.</li>
    <li> As an actor its very important to have a great foundation before makeup application.  This product delivers.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no doubt Carmindy needs to come with this product. I just don&#x27;t get effect she does on TV. But then, cosmetics are about selling dreams! I&#x27;m also not sure whether it&#x27;s supposed to be as thick as it is or whether the product I received is old. It certainly clogged almost at once and doesn&#x27;t spray. Luckily, the spray nozzle is easy to remove so it can be applied without it, but it&#x27;s really a thick cream with tiny &#x27;sparkles&#x27; in it and which catch the light. Doubt it&#x27;s really worth the expense but then we all hope...</li>
    <li> This product is nice. It feels silky and simmers really nice. The only problem iOS, I have oily skin so by mid day my face is shinning too much. But if you have normal skin, you&#x27;ll probably love this product.</li>
    <li> The product is made from high quality ingredients and I could tell because it when on very smoothly and it had a nice aroma. After applying this great product to my skin I noticed that my skin felt much softer and it made my complexion look clearer. There was a notable softness and smooth feeling to my skin after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Read reviews on this product, watched videos was impressed. Bought the product and was unimpressed. The quality just isn&#x27;t as everyone ragged about. I was looking for that dewy look and after applying foundation there was nothing. It serves as a normal primer then. will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This iluminator you can use it alone or add ilumanates powder. Looks great and focus the light perfectly. The only bad thing is the aplicator.  Does not work. I have to open the bottle every time I use it</li>
    <li> This is an awesome primer! Looks great alone or under full foundation.  Gives an even look to skin.  Makes your skin feel fantastic, too.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with my order</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products. I have been using it for several years, but cannot find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I was very well pleased. it goes on in seconds and blends perfectly! It barley feels as if I am</li>
    <li> I love this primer as my face looks younger when I use it. When I wear makeup I use this primer (about 1-2x/week). You have to be careful as it comes out in a shot and product can be lost. As it is expensive you don&#x27;t want to lose any of it.</li>
    <li> Shimmery glittery facial goo?? Skip it! This belongs on a stage performer, so if that&#x27;s you, then go for it. I personally have no need for glitter on my face on a regular day at the office.</li>
    <li> I have used Sally Hansen products before and have been a fan, but I am new to using primer in general.  Even after one use, I was a fan of this product and I will use it everyday.  Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Luminizing Face Primer is not only amazing to apply all on its own, but it makes the foundation or other cosmetics that you use even and flawless.  Not only does it make an amazing primer, but it adds a nice beautiful glow to your face.  I would completely recommend this product to anyone looking to easily enhance their daily cosmetic routines.</li>
    <li> Caused my skin to itch and burn within a few minutes of applying. Evidently, this line is not for me.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product, I love how it feels and my foundation goes on so smoothly. That being said, the price you&#x27;re charging is nothing short of robbery.  This product can be found at most large drugstores or Target, Walmart type places for under 10 dollars, heck, you can even find it at Ulta for under 10.  Is this a joke or a typo??</li>
    <li> Use this product lightly for best results. Makeup glides on and looks fresh the entire day. It was two days late, but that was expected per the reviews I read. Do not use oily moisturizers with this product.</li>
    <li> My inspiration in buying this product was Carmindy herself. I love what she can beautify. My husband and I watch What Not to Wear religiously. I love my new luminizing face primer</li>
    <li> Really a must-have as the base of your make-up application. Leaves you looking flawless!</li>
    <li> Works well for me under bare minerals compact foundation</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great service!!</li>
    <li> i love this primer 1. because its inexpensive &amp; 2. it gives a nice subtle shimmery finish</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Dior spray makeup and the much more economical Sally Hansen beats it by a mile.  The finish is beautiful at 1/4 the price!!!</li>
    <li> A LITTLE goes a long way. Too much will be greasy and shiny, but a tiny drop will give your skin a nice little boost. It&#x27;s VERY light dries up to really soft skin. Even if you use too much, you will sparkle a bit but you&#x27;ll never get that \\&quot;tin man\\&quot; deal others give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never heard of primer before and fell in love with this little guy. Tried plenty of $10-$15 ones when this one got hard to find and realized primer is a difficult thing to like AND to pay for! I&#x27;ve never tried expensive ones no other cheap one I tried came close to this one. Just found it in a strange spot at CVS do I cleaned them out (no way i&#x27;d pay amazon&#x27;s $!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have great skin that just needs a slight daytime glow, this will do it. If you&#x27;re a normal human being who needs makeup, this will really minimize settling lines and pores. It helps it blend when you apply and keeps it there after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mineral-based and should not cause skin problems (has not for me and I&#x27;m quite fair and sensitive), but that&#x27;s something that you really have to try to figure out. At this price, why not?</li>
    <li> I love this product! I used this instead of my usual age defying lotion after washing my face and before applying make up. I also bought Sally Hansen no color shimmer smoothing powder.I used both products together and loved the result. My husband even commented on how beautiful and glowing I was, and I never told him I bought new make up.</li>
    <li> In a quest to reduce the number of items as well as the cost required to complete my makeup everyday I came upon this primer.  Prior to purchasing it, I had been using the Smashbox primer, which I loved.  Well this one did not let me down.  It goes on very smoothly and feels very light on the skin.  I have sensitive and somewhat dry skin, courtesy of aging, but this did not cause me to break out or feel greasy.  Some reviewers stated that it was too glittery, which I did not find.  Most of the glitter stayed on my hands. I found it gave me a very light glow, similar to what your skin would look like after a facial with some oomph.  I have mixed it with a green primer from another brand because I need to get rid of some redness and it mixed very well and worked just as well.  One pump goes a long way.  I use it under foundation powder, not liquid, and it still looks great.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the way your skin look sparkly after use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the pump to work which is super irritating.but I love the product itself...&lt;br /&gt;Good to know it is available for a better price</li>
    <li> Love the primer but it&#x27;s not in the right bottle- it&#x27;s too thick for the pump so I have to open it and &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; some out every time I use it. It&#x27;s not liquid at all- should be in a jar or possibly squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any problem with this product but the illumination is just sparkles which i am not super into. it feels good and goes on easy.</li>
    <li> Feels so smooth on my face and makes makeup go on smoother.  Only problem is that it is almost impossible to get out of the bottle.  I usually have to take the top off and get it out with a Q-tip.  Would be better packaged in a jar.  BUT---I LOVE it and will continue to purchase wherever I can find it.</li>
    <li> Primer is OK.  Packaging horrible.  Primer does not come out of pump.  Do not waste your time or money</li>
    <li> I love this luminizer and I can no longer find it in the stores.  It is very light and gives your skin a nice glow.</li>
    <li> So silky.. and adds just the right sparkle to your face.  I have combination skin, this will not help with oiliness through the day but it will not increase it either.  Great for when you already have a tan and don&#x27;t want to add foundation etc.  I love it for my natural looking days!</li>
    <li> I have many deep wrinkles and I like the product very much (agree SMALL amount works best) but am frustrated that so much remains in the bottle. It&#x27;s glass, so you can&#x27;t break it to reach the rest.  I use a cuticle stick to get out the most I can.  After make up and blush, I put a tiny amount on my fingers and dab it over my skin.  Nice glow without looking artificial....</li>
    <li> Wow! I am super impressed with this luminizing face primer. I have dry skin and just a small (seriously, SMALL) amount of this primer made my entire face silky smooth (I want to keep feeling my face!). It evens out my complexion (I have some dark spots here and there, and it just tends to look uneven) to the point where I&#x27;d be fine wearing just the primer, with no makeup. I put on some makeup (nothing major, just blush and bronzer) later that day, though, and it looked great. I love the consistency of the primer, it just glides on. As far as the &amp;#34;luminizing&amp;#34; part, it does luminize, with a slight shimmer. Slight, mind you, not glittery or washed out, nothing like that. It&#x27;s part of the reason I would be completely comfortable wearing JUST this primer. This is one of those beauty products that I&#x27;ll likely be putting in my daily routine, and one of those products that I&#x27;ll want to stock up on, because I&#x27;d like to maintain this look and this feel.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, but the dispenser clogs up and in order to use the product, you have to open it up.  This is the 2nd time this has happened.  You try and pump the product out, but it gets totally clogged.  This is the very last time I will use this.</li>
    <li> The Sally Hansen Natural Beauty by Carmindy Luminizing Face Primer is a wonderful product. It is the perfect base for your makeup and gives you a soft, silky, dewy look. The primer is moisturizing so your foundation glides on smoothly after applying it over the primer. The formula also seems to give extra staying power to your foundation so that it lasts longer and stays looking fresher and luminous throughout the day. There was no sticky or waxy feel to this this primer, it felt very clean, natural, and light. This is a great product that helps keep your skin hydrated and radiant looking all day. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This was the best thing to smooth my skin before applying makeup. Never irritating to my dry, sensitive skin and lets makeup glide on smoothly. Gives you a slight glow. If you can find it somewhere, only use a couple of drops for your whole face and neck. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product - just as advertised.  Highly recommend for those looking for a good face primer that doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the pump did not work so I had to scoop it out with the stick. It&#x27;s not worth the price when you can go to your local drugstore and buy primer for a cheaper price and works just as well if not better.</li>
    <li> globs up about half way through the bottle</li>
    <li> Love it make up stays on all day..very light on the skin</li>
    <li> It is a great product goes on smoothly !!!!</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to try a primer on my face as I&#x27;m so used to my daily routine: Face lotion and then makeup. However, I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primer is very lightweight and non-greasy, which is exactly what I need on my skin. It has a subtle shimmer that makes my skin absolutely luminous. I applied my foundation over the primer and I was shocked at how smooth it went on. I usually use mineral powder after my foundation but there was no need! My skin looked flawless and just felt good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to say that my makeup stayed fresh all day and into the night (no need to reapply) and I highly recommend this product. I wish I had tried it sooner!</li>
    <li> I have been using this since Carmindy first came out with her line. I love this product. It gives my aging skin a look of being hydrated and luminous. I was really upset when I could no longer find it in the stores. I hope that they keep producing it, though I think the price should be back to the original (around $12.00 a bottle). Also, the pump never works particularly well and doesn&#x27;t reach all of the product. I use the end of it to scoop out a small amount which goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This makes my makeup go on smooth.  I had a hard time finding this for awhile.  Glad to see it again.</li>
    <li> Makes my face soft and smooth</li>
    <li> This is the best primer ever.  It goes on so smoothly and makes your foundation go on so smoothly as well.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m sad they are no longer making it!</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth with a slight sheen to it. Great to prep your face or wear alone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine as a facial primer.  It does have specks of glitter which is what makes it luminous.  It is not at all greasy.  Maybe people think it is because it&#x27;s so smooth, but it isn&#x27;t at all.  If anything, it&#x27;s a little drying--like most facial primers I have used.  It does take a minute to dry and makeup goes over it very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is also with the pump.  Either nothing comes out or a big blob flies out and hits me in the shoulder.  I love the pump idea, but if it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s worse than a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***February 20th Edit:  I am editing this to add that you should not get it on your lips.  I didn&#x27;t connect it at the time, but a few weeks after I started using this primer I noticed my lips were uncomfortably dry.  I bought a number of lip balms looking for one that would give me relief.  I finally realized that the chapped lips started several weeks after I started using this primer.  I made sure not to get it on my lips again and now my lips are back to normal.</li>
    <li> Love it...feels like silk.  I just wished it came in a larger size for the same price. I&#x27;ll but this again.</li>
    <li> i love the way how it feels on my face but u must have to put a little on your face so it doesnot look glittery on your face</li>
    <li> I have  used a primer before and wasn&#x27;t impressed with it but this primer is great!  I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it and will continue to use this primer.  I will also recommend this to all my f</li>
    <li> I hated it .My face did not glow,it was greasy.I might as well have put lard on it.This is not what I thought at all.</li>
