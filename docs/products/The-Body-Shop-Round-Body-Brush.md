      <li>Was really dissapointed.</li>

      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>

      <li>The brush has completely eliminated the problem.</li>
      <li>it makes my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>The brush is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt and leaves a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to your skin when you are done.  </li>

<li> Other brushes are too gentle for dry brushing.</li>
<li> Also, I was a kidney donor last December and since the surgery I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems with dry flaking skin on my stomach.</li>
<li> I use it daily as a dry brush solution but have also used it with a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I noticed some reviews said the wood had cracked even when they left it to dry in areas with a lot of air.</li>
<li> I wanted to try dry brushing to improve my skin which is very sensitive, dry and sometimes a little blotchy.</li>
<li> The bristels are a bit too long.  </li>
<li> The only thing I&#x27;m concerned about is cleaning it do to the reviews about not getting it wet</li>
<li> This brush is a little bit rough still for my sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use it every</li>
<li> Finally, the knob fell off due to wood rot.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t realize - it&#x27;s for dry brushing.  </li>
<li> Shouldn&#x27;t use it in the shower but  for dry use.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s for DRY brushing, not washing.</li>
<li> As other reviewers have said, yes, the bristles are someone hard and a little unpleasant on your skin the first time you use it; however, after the third or fourth time you come to enjoy it and even look forward to the next time you use it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not very consistent with it.. and its helped with my dry skin..</li>
<li> This is a dry brush!</li>
<li> know the description says it is for dry or wet use, but I can&#x27;t see how it could work in the shower.  </li>
<li> Needless to say this was a super deal</li>
<li> Think twice before buying this product unless you plan on never getting it wet.  </li>
<li> This brush works just the same, if not better.  </li>
<li> You should never get the brush wet!</li>
<li> The directions indicate to rinse the brush off after each use; I would dry the brush bristles-up which caused the water to go into the handle and destroy the brush.</li>
<li> The bristles are stiff enough to work, but not so stiff that they hurt.</li>
<li> and this isn&#x27;t too rough to use a few times a week before the shower.</li>
<li> After the brush gets wet and dries a few times, the handle falls off, and cannot be reconnected.  </li>
<li> DON&#x27;T use it in the shower, it&#x27;ll mess it up.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a year.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many body brushes, and I love this one the best. Great for dry brushing, and I also use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will always reorder this one.</li>
    <li> Have you ever been to get a massage and they try to sell you the REALLY expensive buffing brush they use?  Don&#x27;t let them rope you in to buying a fifty dollar brush.  This brush works just the same, if not better.  I love it very much!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to exfoliate when I shower or bath.  It works great for getting rid of the old skin cells.  The brush is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt and leaves a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to your skin when you are done.  It also helps if you use a &amp;#34;faux tanning&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> I give this a great review. I&#x27;ve had mine for five year and with twice a week use it&#x27;s still in perfect shape. It&#x27;s sturdy and well designed. While I use this on myself, I&#x27;d love if it came with an attachment with a nice deep voice and lots of patience to brush my back. Slowly. Purrr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a damn shower accessory so please don&#x27;t try and make it one. Your skin and circulation will love you.</li>
    <li> Man this thing hurts.  I want to love it, but i must have sensitive skin or something.  It feels like it scractches me all the time.</li>
    <li> Think twice before buying this product unless you plan on never getting it wet.  The materials are good quality but it is not designed to last.  The body and the handle are two separate pieces of wood.  After the brush gets wet and dries a few times, the handle falls off, and cannot be reconnected.  Mine lasted about a year.  It should have been made out of a solid piece of wood.  I suspect that once, it was.</li>
    <li> I was asked to but one of these brushes on a recent cruise for about 4 times this price. Needless to say this was a super deal</li>
    <li> My brush cracked and warped not long after I began using it. After about 6 months of use, the brush split in two. The directions indicate to rinse the brush off after each use; I would dry the brush bristles-up which caused the water to go into the handle and destroy the brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush since I purchase it a few weeks ago... My body is so smooth. It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought I love it so far.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels but I have to say the lotion kind of clumps in it. I even use the body shop butters too. But I like it.</li>
    <li> This works so great on getting a great body exfoliating/ dry brushing. Great quality and the handle it&#x27;s easy to grab. My skin feels amazing afterwards. When you first start dry brushing it feels weird but not painful or uncomfortable, now it just feels awesome.</li>
    <li> The handle came off after the second use.  Was really dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Great little brush.  My kids and I use everyday in place of a loofah.</li>
    <li> The handle broke off as soon as I started using it on the first try. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Feels perfect. I have very sensitive skin and this isn&#x27;t too rough to use a few times a week before the shower. Makes my skin feel silky smooth!</li>
    <li> this item is great for slubbing off skin cells and stimulating the blood vessels.  The bristles are soft enough to do the job intended.</li>
    <li> While I didn&#x27;t notice any improved difference in my cellulite, this brush definitely helped keep that awful winter skin at bay! Silky soft smooth legs in combination with the Thymes Bar Soap, Essentials, 7-Ounce Bar :) Love how my legs feel!!</li>
    <li> This brush has a great strength to its bristles. I use it daily as a dry brush solution but have also used it with a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the handle so that I can adjust to go softer or harder on areas as I please. Other brushes are too gentle for dry brushing. My skin is super soft thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved his brush.  Other people commented that the wood cracked, so I was careful to make sure I stored it so the water would run off.  It cracked anyway, so I treated it with wood oil to keep it from getting worse. But it cracked more, and then started to warp. Finally, the knob fell off due to wood rot. This is the best body brush I&#x27;ve ever had, but unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do well with water. It lasted 5 months.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and use it everyday. I dry brush to exfoliate, and this is perfect. the handle is comfortable, the bristles are the right firmness, and the brush covers a large area without being too bulky. DON&#x27;T use it in the shower, it&#x27;ll mess it up. It&#x27;s for DRY brushing, not washing.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this to put into my gym bag for showering - oops!  Didn&#x27;t realize - it&#x27;s for dry brushing.  Could you use it in the shower?  I suppose you could.  I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but I think I&#x27;m about to.  Good quality product - especially if you&#x27;re into dry brushing your skin (which I&#x27;m not).</li>
    <li> I was looking for a body brush and really like the size of this one.  I like that you can use with the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> I love this.. I&#x27;ve never used one before.. it makes my skin so soft. I was hoping it would help with stretch marks.. I do see a little difference tho I&#x27;m not very consistent with it.. and its helped with my dry skin.. which is awesome.. deffinately worth it to me:)</li>
    <li> The body shop dry brush is excellent and made with great quality!!! Yes I would recommend to all my friends!!! thanks! cmh</li>
    <li> Great for dry body exfoliation. A little hard on the skin.</li>
    <li> This brush is a little bit rough still for my sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I do like this brush though!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try dry brushing to improve my skin which is very sensitive, dry and sometimes a little blotchy. The quality of this brush is very good, it feels sturdy in my hand and it hasn&#x27;t really shed any bristles while I used it.  Unfortunately it is a little to firm for my skin and made my dry skin problems a little worse after a few days use.  I guess I need something softer for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I recommend this body brush. Shouldn&#x27;t use it in the shower but  for dry use. It does a nice job. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The bristels are a bit too long.  it does the job well, but i think a shorter bristle would be better.  i do get very clean though</li>
    <li> This is a great, great brush for dry brushing.  My skin feels super soft every time use it; which is usually right before I  shower.  The wait was several weeks but it was well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Have to be gentle with this one or it will scratch your skin but other than that, I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give a proper review.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. The top knob is easy to grip and not awkward to use. The bristles are stiff enough to work, but not so stiff that they hurt. I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a year.  It feels great and exfoliates and softens my skin.  I hand the brush to my husband, lie down, and suddenly my bedroom is a spa.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the description says it is for dry or wet use, but I can&#x27;t see how it could work in the shower.  Based on the other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t look like a good idea.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this at all. The brush has warped and changed shape and the wood is splitting and cracked. Cool, now I can decide if I want to go through the process of a lengthy expensive return process or keep the piece of crap. NOT worth the money I paid at all!! Very UN-SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, yes, the bristles are someone hard and a little unpleasant on your skin the first time you use it; however, after the third or fourth time you come to enjoy it and even look forward to the next time you use it. I saw a big improvement on the tightness of my skin, especially in my arms. Also, I was a kidney donor last December and since the surgery I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems with dry flaking skin on my stomach. The brush has completely eliminated the problem. my skin feels softer everywhere and definitely looks nicer. This is a dry brush! I noticed some reviews said the wood had cracked even when they left it to dry in areas with a lot of air. You should never get the brush wet! and then you won&#x27;t have that problem. I&#x27;m highly satisfied and would readily recommend this brush to anyone!</li>
    <li> The bristles are perfect and even though the knob looks like it would be hard to hold, it is not.. The auto delivery for a replacement is great .. Good price</li>
    <li> This brush is easy to hold and a great dry brush all around. The only thing I&#x27;m concerned about is cleaning it do to the reviews about not getting it wet which is the only reason for four stars instead of five. It&#x27;s the best dry brush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
