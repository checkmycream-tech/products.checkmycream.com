<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product just took forever</li>
    <li> Great for picking up gems</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money!</li>
    <li> price friendly workable too</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to getting these to apply small gems to my nails. However, the tips are uneven. One is longer than the other, so it makes it close to impossible to pick anything up. Would&#x27;ve been nice, but i guess i&#x27;ll stick to regular tweezers for now.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT!!!  You can&#x27;t beat the price....  durable...  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This tool is particularly useful for applying individual lashes, although I find all sorts of uses for it besides. I use it on strip lashes as well and sometimes it is just the thing you need to get into a tight corner (I sterilize it afterwards, of course). Also can get dust out of that stand up fan, pick up small gems, or help you gently squeeze that miscellaneous blackhead which may appear in a strange place.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work perfect for rhinestones and they pick them up easily. However, I tried to use these with some nail striping tape and it totally didn&#x27;t work. I ended up using my fingers, but for rhinestones, they work great.</li>
    <li> I love this seller! I buy a lot of my nail supplies from them and have yet to be disappointed. I&#x27;ve saved a ton of money buying from them and all the products are terrific including this one. The price is more than reasonable, and the product works wonderfully! Will (and have) buy again!</li>
    <li> I was using toothpicks and eyelash tweezers to pick up my rhinestones when doing nail art. Now I have these tweezers. They seem to be ergonomic ally correct. No more frustration when it comes to picking up and applying the stones. I may also try them when applying my individual lashes.</li>
    <li> This is good alternative to high end brands it does the job well... I have the sheumura its like there is no difference highly recommend this:)</li>
    <li> Got these tweezers for doing my nails because I am VERY into painting and doing my nails. I my friend has been putting nail stones on her nails and I thought it was adorable. Well anyway. I bought rhinestones online because in stores they are just way to expensive and I got the tweezers too because how else would I pick them up ! They arrived two weeks before said to arrive and they came in a brand new box and they work great ! Defiantly recomend for nail stones and even doing your eyebrows !!!</li>
    <li> very sharp, be careful!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for picking up small gems!  They aren&#x27;t tiny &amp; feel very sturdy.  Am glad I made this purchase!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for holding/flipping over/placing or anything with Rhinestones. Also works well for helping undo tight knots.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are at a very low price and I cant wait to try them out. The only down side is that part of the black paint is chipping off.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for quality tweezers for nail art, you might want to go elsewhere.  Remember, you get what you pay for, so if it&#x27;s just a stop-gap pair you want, this is it.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, will buy again</li>
    <li> Love these! I ordered two, one for placing jems  on nails and one for applying false eyelashes. Got in 3 days.</li>
    <li> Good for small items like beads, lashes, stones, etc.</li>
    <li> Finally got the tweezers and they are exactly as mentioned. These will work well for fine details and for applying eyelashes</li>
    <li> Wanted to get this for craft work - it arrived very fast, and is exactly what I needed for precise paper craft work.</li>
    <li> They were so thin at the bottom and they held on to the rhinestone without dropping it. I was so excited when I got this.</li>
    <li> These are a must for applying rhinestones. Great at picking up and placing, couldn&#x27;t get by with my nail art if I didn&#x27;t have these. Good price too.</li>
    <li> I love doing nail art designs. It&#x27;s a lot of fun. I like being creative. Will recommend it to my friends,</li>
    <li> I like the product&#x27;s color.  It works well and its proportioned properly.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are very nice quality, perfect for picking up rhinestones/ pearls/ etc.. They are matte black, with some white writing on the side. Nothing special to look at so I think I&#x27;m going to bling them out! :)  Great price, great quality- If I ever need another pair I&#x27;ll be buying these same ones.</li>
    <li> The product is so good and the price to. Deliver the product was on time and good to. I will keep buying items with you guys. I will recommend this product to my friends and family. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Got my tweezers today and I am very happy with them. They are black. They are very pointed at the tip so it makes grabbing stones and various nail art accessories very well. It took a long time to get here but still came within the dates of delivery given.</li>
    <li> a bit sharp and pointy, but overall i love this tweezer because it can get all the tiny products that i needs</li>
    <li> I never received it!! Thank god it was not a lot or i would be livid. and the point to even add more words to this review is a RIP OFF I do not recommend!</li>
    <li> This product works good and does what it&#x27;s suppose to the reason for the 4 star rating is that it took almost 2 months to get.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the price, and these tweezers are so sharp and precise.  I plan to use these for many more things other than nail art.  I am a crafter and I see these having multiple uses.</li>
    <li> I found these tweezers to be very well made, and the ultra-pointy tips perfect for placing tiny gemstones.  They&#x27;re quite worth the price, which was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  She loves it and says it works great for her teenager and her friends. Would recommend for anyone doing nail art.</li>
    <li> Works great, picks up rhinestones securely. A great buy and a must have for nail art.</li>
    <li> Works great and cant beat price.  Easy to use specially with the extremely small stones that I add to nails</li>
    <li> These came with a very small bend in one tine that was easily fixed.They&#x27;re not the highest manufacturing quality but they serve their purpose quite well. They were cheap and they even came with a nice little tip guard so the tines don&#x27;t scratch things unintentionally.</li>
    <li> Very handing when doing french nails and with the little studs.</li>
    <li> Work awesomley are very helpful. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I purchased these art tweezers along with the Nail Decorations By Cheeky- 10 Nail Decoration Wheels of Premium Manicure.  These tweezers work great for picking up and placement of all of the nail decorations, regardless of size, shape or texture of the nail decoration.  Great addition for manicures and pedicures when using any kind of decorative stones or stick on.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work very well when picking up nail polish art (small diamonds etc)  The angle is perfect for pulling the tiny pieces out of the container</li>
    <li> Super quick delivery..Black Nail Art Tweezer for Rhinestones is perfect to use when you have to apply your rhinestones to your nail design.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the nail crystals</li>
    <li> These tweezers are very nice, I bought them to use for putting on individual eyelashes. They are perfect for this!</li>
    <li> These nail art tweezers are perfect. Not only did they come in the mail incredibly fast, they also have many purposes. I am new to nail art and they are making picking up small pieces a breeze. I also use them for other cosmetic purposes. Believe it or not I have use them for other things around my home. I am considering buying another pair. One will be just for cosmetic purposes and the other will be for miscellaneous stuff. I&#x27;m really impressed by how fast they arrived to me in the mail and how useful they are. They aren&#x27;t the prettiest things in the world, but they certainly are the handiest. if all else fails as they will be perfect self defense tool!</li>
    <li> For lash extensions, the tip is great and I like the length (doesn&#x27;t hit mag lamp).  Price and quality is good.</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezers, excellent seller!</li>
    <li> These tweezer&#x27;s serve their purpose. They are great for putting the little rhinestones on nails. Great material and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This arrived very fast! It&#x27;s perfect for applying actual individual lashes. Normally, this is done at a salon, but I&#x27;m able to do it on myself after experimenting with the knock-off drug store kind for a while. Anyway, these forceps are so perfect for applying actual individual false lashes. I know they are under nail art for rhinestones, but I used them for lashes instead.</li>
    <li> Beyond what I expected. Perfect for picking up tiny rhinestones. They came with a little tip cover thing which keeps them thr right shape. A+ would order again.</li>
    <li> Tweezer are just as described &amp; just what I needed. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product but took a very long time to receive!!!</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied with this purchase, came on time no problems.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it!</li>
    <li> They are wonderful.. I use them for jewelry as well.. A true bargain.. I am kicking myself for not buying two.</li>
    <li> I was more protected while using this because it is curved it is not like sharp points pointed directly to your eye and the material of it is comfortable while using it</li>
    <li> These are a must have for nail techs. It works amazing and is very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed then for. Looks just like the picture.  Easy to use when using for picking up rhinestones</li>
    <li> Came in a good condition. Very useful for nails and small stuff</li>
    <li> Very useful for nail art .</li>
    <li> I really needed a tool to us to apply items to nail art.  It has to be done carefully, but it has helped me many times.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these for rhinestones, but they&#x27;re amazing for applying individual lashes. I definitely recommend this product for that use.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot. They are sturdy as far as holding things go but don&#x27;t expect to use them for hairs and such. They are very sharp also- so be careful!</li>
    <li> These work very well to help put the gems on your finger nails.  Much easier than doing it without them or a normal tweezers.</li>
    <li> I use these tweezers for my electronics projects and they are even better than I expected.  I was expecting some cheap import tweezers that didn&#x27;t align correctly or would snap after a few uses.  To my surprise, these are actually well constructed for the price and the needle tip alignment is spot on.  I use them with my magnifying headset to pick up even the tiniest of screws and circuit board components.  I will probably buy another set or two just to have around.  At one point I got a tiny metal sliver in my finger, and they even did a great job with that.  Combined with my high power magnifier I was able to remove the tiny sliver fairy easily.  I couldn&#x27;t even see it with my naked eye.  Certainly a good investment for any kind of hobbyist with fine work to do.</li>
    <li> These are heavy duty, sharp, wonderful tweezers that really work.  I can&#x27;t believe they are so inexpensive, because they are high quality, and actually pinch whatever you&#x27;re using them for (yes, they will pull small hairs too,  unlike other tweezers I&#x27;ve tried).  I bought them for eyelash cluster applications, and they&#x27;re great.  My husband is using a pair to pick up small electronic parts, and loves them for that too.  I bought three pairs, and will definitely come back for more when I need them.  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you- they are wonderful!</li>
    <li> This item helps u get the smallest item &amp; makes it easier to use? Great for eyelashes and other small items</li>
    <li> Somewhat good enough tweezer for rhinestones, mine doesn&#x27;t hold the rhinestone very good which is frustrating but its to be expected for the price.</li>
    <li> This rhinestone tweezer works well and is very easy to use most of the time, however, since it&#x27;s very strong, it sometimes pop the rhinestones out because of too much grip. You really have to master controlling the grip.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, great quality, can&#x27;t beat the price! Craft stores rip you off, this was awesome. And yes it takes a little longer, but it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re not exactly waiting for every day ha ha!</li>
    <li> it was as described very helpful tool to help put you false eyelashes on. it holds them then it can move them.</li>
    <li> Feels a little cheap but it works great!</li>
    <li> I have not used it for nail art because that wasn&#x27;t the description when I bought it. It was for fake eyelashes when I bought it and it works good for applying the lashes. I tried pulling my eyebrows hairs with it and it doesn&#x27;t quite work for that. But it worked for what it was described for, it never said anything about being an eyebrow tweezer so it&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
    <li> Get tweezers for picking up small rhinestones and items to put on your nails</li>
    <li> Works great, quite sharp and precise. Good buy!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are a must for those that apply individual false lashes. Best style tweezer to use. I thought I had lost mine so I ordered a second one immediately. Unfortunately, the second one was not usable at all. Whenever I tried to grab a lash with the tweezers, it would either cut it or I was not able to get a good grip on it at all. So, I hope you don&#x27;t get a defective one.</li>
    <li> They came from China &amp; again I didn&#x27;t know, but they are really nice &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Made it very easy to design my nails.....also my family and friends nails as well.  I will always use it.</li>
    <li> Beautifully made. I have no idea how they are able to sell these for almost nothing with free shipping. If I were a store-owner I would order these by the dozen and make a killing selling them for five-times what I paid.</li>
    <li> They work great! Makes using rhinestones a breeze!</li>
    <li> Tweezer portion bends easily rendering them useless.</li>
    <li> this is a great nail art pick up</li>
    <li> These work pretty well. Good price too.</li>
    <li> does not grasp lashes</li>
    <li> Love it, it works great for it faster the shipping estimated date. I will buy from again and definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Having these tweezers near by to help pick up  very small items has certainly helped me in my card making.</li>
    <li> This  is perfect for picking up rhinestones for nail art. It took a while to get here as it came from Asia but still worth the wait. It&#x27;s well made and the tip is nice and sharp....meaning it&#x27;s accurate.</li>
    <li> I love my product! Such a great value! Exactly what I wanted! I was so happy when I received my package! I&#x27;m a happy customer! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty nice.. It makes it so much easier to select the single lashes from the box and apply ..</li>
    <li> This is a must have set of tweezers if you do your own nails and apply gems. No more dabbing a little clear nail polish on the end of a stick. These pick them right up and you just apply the gem where you want...no mess! Sparkles</li>
    <li> I placed the order on March 14th and received it on April 9th, almost an entire month later. The tweezer was shipped in an envelope too small with the tip of the tweezer piercing through the envelope. One of the tips is completely bent and now it is of no use whatsoever. Granted it only costs 0.87 cents, this is the worst purchase expereince ever.</li>
    <li> The tips are smooth so it is hard to get odd shapes. But its ok.</li>
    <li> I just love this little tweezer! I am always decorating my nails with rhinestones, so this is my tried and true tool when it comes to turning them over, picking them up and placing them. I have a lot of irregularly shaped nail rhinestones (stars, squares, hearts, diamonds), so this gives me the control I need to effectively use them without messing my nails up or dropping them all over the floor. The pointed tips make it super easy to grab even the really tiny round rhinestones that I use sometimes, which cannot be said for regular slanted tweezers. I unfortunately misplaced this particular tweezer recently, so I have been using my regular tweezers until I can find it....UGH. Talk about annoying! I can barely pick the largest of rhinestones up with my normal tweezers, so I haven&#x27;t been applying nearly as many. If I can&#x27;t find this tweezer soon I am definitely going to have to order another because those other tools just aren&#x27;t cutting it!</li>
    <li> works will with the nail jewels to place them on the nails</li>
    <li> you have to  have these to,put on the nail jewelry.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! They are very precise when picking up a rhinestone. Sturdy and light weight. I am sure they will last a long while where I won&#x27;t have to keep buying them.</li>
    <li> This resulted to be a very nice tool, of higher quality than expected</li>
    <li> I love it, very helpful for decorating my nails.</li>
    <li> I have never received this order. Since it&#x27;s cheap. I will let it go and will not ask for a refund.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  I got this for my daughter to use with the nail art rhinestones. She is very pleased!</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;I asked my daughter how she likes her tweezer because I purchased it for her. She likes doing her nails and adding those teeny rhinestones. This is all she uses she said. She loves it&lt;br /&gt;deezie</li>
    <li> I only used it once yet, however, I am sure I am going to get a lot of use out of them in the near future.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these tweezers. I use them mainly for picking up my fimo nail art and other forms of nail art and placing them on my nails.</li>
    <li> This takes long to ship but worth the wait as it looks very nice, sturdy, affordable, and best of all makes my life easier handling eyelash extensions.</li>
    <li> Not the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought. The edges are too rounded to do their job.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!  I bought this item to use for my nail art and rhinstones!  It&#x27;s perfect. I have to admit that I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to pick them up and put them on the nail and I could!  If I can anyone can!  Will buy again if need be! SUPER SUPER SUPER FAST shipping!  It was the first item to come in TWO DAYS of the 8 items I ordered!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that was received in a decent amount of time.  It is exactly as advertised.  Thanks</li>
    <li> These work very well for placing tiny rhinestones and sequins.  My fingers don&#x27;t like doing the tiny detailed work anymore , so these tweezers are a big help.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a decent amount of time&lt;br /&gt;The product wasn&#x27;t the same as described in the picture&lt;br /&gt;They are straight instead of curved at the end&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked them more if it was the curved ones like in the picture, but I still use them,&lt;br /&gt;and they worked just fine for my nail art</li>
    <li> These tweezer&#x27;s have served their purpose for helping me put bling bling on my nails and my toes.  They are very easy to use.  Glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> Picks up my gems, and makes placing gems a lot easier</li>
