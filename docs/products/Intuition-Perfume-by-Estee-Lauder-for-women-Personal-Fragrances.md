      <li>Intuition has a clean fresh fragrance and is long lasting!  </li>
      <li>Enjoy purchasing a product I normally buy for less than would have otherwise paid for it.</li>
      <li>It is not an old lady smell, but definitely for the mature woman.</li>
      <li>as a man, the thing I hate most is being in a store with these old women who wear cheap cologne and smell like they took a bath in it.</li>

    <li> The perfume is just like was stated.  Enjoy purchasing a product I normally buy for less than would have otherwise paid for it.</li>
    <li> Everywhere I wear this, people ask me what I am wearing. It seems to go really well with bright clothing.</li>

    <li> I LOVE this scent and I&#x27;ve worn it for years.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to get.  This was a good price and it arrived fast!</li>

    <li> Best price I could find on my favorite perfume :)</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and a better price than at mall...and better yet, no trip to the mall.</li>
    <li> Ordered 3.5 oz received 1.7 oz.  Was a big hassle to return and had to&lt;br /&gt;Pay to return.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and was factory sealed.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite scent by Estée Lauder. Not flowery or sweet but warm and sensual yet not heavy or musky.</li>
    <li> This is our daughter&#x27;s favorite scent...it was delivered earlier than promised (!), boxed &amp; protected with the outer box with tissue wadded to thoroughly pad the box; it will be for her @ Christmas...she&#x27;ll be delighted &amp; the price was lower than from either of the Frangrance sites that we&#x27;ve used in the past. Super service, highly recommended vendor! Will revisit to reorder; completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s is what she wanted and she now has it and loves it. She is very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  I think the product is a great price for the money.  Much less than in the department store</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume and I&#x27;ve been buying it for her for 10 years or more. It&#x27;s got a lovely fragrance and won&#x27;t knock you down with an overpowering smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean... as a man, the thing I hate most is being in a store with these old women who wear cheap cologne and smell like they took a bath in it. Whew! Similarly, being on an airplane with competing cologne and perfume smells wafting through the cabin on a long, long trip. That should be outlawed! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this perfume... you get what you pay for and this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> My favorite!  I hope it is available for years to come!  It&#x27;s been my signature scent for several years.  I always get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is my mom&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  It is usually in department stores with little discount and very limited online for less.  It is not an old lady smell, but definitely for the mature woman. I could see my wife (30) wearing this.  The price on Amazon was great with the super saver shipping.  Good gift for wife or mom.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister.  She loves Intuition, and it smells very good on her.  It&#x27;s her signature fragrance.  She couldn&#x27;t find it except for in the smaller bottles.  This one will last her about 10 months.  Intuition is an awesome perfume. I hope they never quit making it.  One spray lasts all day long, and smells great.  Unlike some fragrances by Estee Lauder that are season scents, this one can be worn summer and winter.</li>
