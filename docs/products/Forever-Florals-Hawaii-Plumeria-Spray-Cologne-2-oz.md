    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to buy this perfume in Hawaii when I was there, so when I seen it I had to have it.</li>
    <li> This is probably the 4th bottle of the cologne that i have bought from this vendor.  It is always wrapped well and comes very quickly after I purchase it.

    <li> The scent has an undertone of plumeria then other woody notes.  I had tried other plumeria perfumes this was my second favorite.  Terra Nova has a plumeria scent that is floral with no woody notes.</li>
    <li> smells great.  Just like I remember in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> An excellent scent that really reminds you of Hawaii.  It&#x27;s subtle and not over powering.  It also adds that psychological advantage of reminding you of the islands.</li>

    <li> Smells justi like Hawaiian Plumeria&#x27;s. Will be buying more right away.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, reminds me of Hawaii!</li>
    <li> I have a girlfriend who LOVES this scent, and I thought it would make the best Christmas present.  She was absolutley delighted when she opened it.
