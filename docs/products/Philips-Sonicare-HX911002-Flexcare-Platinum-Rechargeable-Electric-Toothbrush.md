<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was probably our 4th sonicare now. Love the product but don&#x27;t like the reliability. All the replacements add up to hundreds of dollars for a tooth brush, but I do believe that when it works they are by far, superior in terms of cleansing your teeth. My wife and I used to share a single brush barrel and change the heads each time we use it, but I feel that the constant changing of heads created extra wear and tear and I believe that was partly the reason why we have to keep replacing the barrels. So what we have done now is buy a his and her barrel. Its a different model to the one I am rating now, but so far, we have had about 6 months with no issues.</li>
    <li> Cleans very well and I like the massaging setting for the gums. However, I find this model to be very noisy and a bit flimsy compared to our older model, the 9500 which is still going strong after more than 12 years!</li>
    <li> It cleans, and floss teeth very well. Perfect to have it, so you don&#x27;t need to do cleaning at dentist office.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. I do not know where to begin. I can not imagine ever not owning this thing.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never felt so healthy. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! Not sure about all benefits being touted but I wouldn&#x27;t trade the feeling for the world.</li>
    <li> It is works good. Just the Handel little big.</li>
    <li> Had to replace my aging Sonicare which by the way lasted way longer than I ever expected.  So after viewing all models, I decided on this one. .  Don&#x27;t see any real difference save for the fact I like it&#x27;s slimmer profile.  Hope it holds up as long as the other one did.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes in my household for years.  In our experience, these things usually die (as in the battery no longer holds a charge or the toothbrush just stops vibrating altogether)  after about 4 years, but the quality of the clean we experience has still made it worth it for us to stick with the Sonicare line.  We currently have the Philips Sonicare HX6932/10 FlexCare RS930 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush which was purchased in April 2009. About a week after receiving the Flexcare Platinum toothbrush set, our FlexCare Plus toothbrush started malfunctioning and eventually stopped working, but that gave us some time to do some side by side comparisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The footprint of this new Flexcare Platinum toothbrush is much smaller than the Flexcare RS930.  Of course, it doesn&#x27;t include the sanitizer, but compared to some of the previous models with holders for multiple brush heads, this one does seem smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference we noticed between our toothbrushes was the sound.  This new model is significantly quieter than the older FlexCare RS930 was.  When using the RS930, it was difficult to hear the TV or other people when they were talking and it was so loud sometimes it would be disruptive to quiet morning sleep cycles.  While the Flexcare Platinum isn&#x27;t totally silent, it&#x27;s much easier to hear and no one has experienced a rude AM awaking from the sound of the toothbrush operating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were using a model like the FlexCare RS930, you&#x27;ll be pleased to know that the brush heads will work on this newer model - this was great news for me because while the brush heads that came with this new toothbrush gave me a great clean feeling on my teeth, they were a little too tough on my gums for daily use.  I was able to swap back to my ultra sensitive brush heads without issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides: The brushes that come with this don&#x27;t have the rings to mark each toothbrush, so if you&#x27;re sharing a handle with someone else, you have to figure out a different marking system.  Also, if this toothbrush is going to fizzle after 3 or 4 years, it still is pricey for a toothbrush.  As far as I can tell, you still can&#x27;t simply swap out the old dead battery and order a new one and once this beast dies, you&#x27;ll have to order an entirely new system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we&#x27;re still very pleased with this new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This thing is very powerful.  It will seem like it&#x27;s rattling your teeth out, but it does a great job and is quickly adapted to.</li>
    <li> Finally: My dental hygienist gave me praise instead of a scolding following my last cleaning a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I credit this turnaround to the Philips Sonicare toothbrush. For several years I&#x27;ve been using those disposal battery-powered toothbrushes popular in grocery stores. To me the results of those were far better than the conventional toothbrush I grew up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Philips Sonicare. The toothbrush was much more powerful than I had ever imaged a toothbrush could be. There are 3 speed settings and on the highest one I soon learned the importance of keeping my mouth firmly closed around the toothbrush: the bathroom mirror was speckled with toothpaste. At all settings your can feel your head sort of vibrate - in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also 3 brushing modes: Clean, White and Gum Care:&lt;br /&gt;* Clean &#x3D; \\&quot;ultimate in plaque removal\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;* White &#x3D; \\&quot;2 minutes to remove surface stains and 30 seconds to brighten and polish your front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;* Gum Care &#x3D; \\&quot;combines Clean Mode\\&quot; with an additional minute to gently stimulate and massage gums to improve gum health.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the slowest setting and the \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot; brushing mode. The slowest setting, however, is many times faster than the disposable battery-powered toothbrushes I had been using. It even cleans in-between teeth where my previous toothbrushes missed. I still floss, but the Philips Sonicare makes it less urgent for me to do so every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature I particularly like is called the \\&quot;Pressure Sensor,\\&quot; which will make a noise and also slow down the speed when you press too hard (I tend to do that so this is a great feature for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use an addition option, \\&quot;Smartimer,\\&quot; which automatically turns off at the end of the brushing cycle - the idea is to train you to spend just the right amount of time on each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary I recommend the Philips Sonicare toothbrush. It makes keeping your teeth and gums clean and healthy fast, east - and yes, a little fun.- and yes, a little fun.</li>
    <li> The jury is, to a certain extent, still out on this one.  I&#x27;ll try to repost once I&#x27;ve had my next dental checkup to see if i get a better report from the dentist.  But, I&#x27;m giving only three stars at this point because, comparied to the significantly less expensive Sonicare I replaced with this, it comes up lacking in many areas.  The pros are that this one has a quadpacer and it&#x27;s much easier to clean than the previous one was.  The cons?  For me, the thinner diameter makes it more uncomfortable to hold and I also dislike the the little bumps on the back of the handle - they feel like my palm is being rubbed with sandpaper while I&#x27;m using the brush.  Last, but definitely not least, even after one cycle on &amp;quot;Clean&amp;quot; and one cycle on &amp;quot;White,&amp;quot; my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they did with the less expensive brush.  Right now, this brush seems all about form over function.  Unless my checkup is much better next time, I&#x27;m going to wish I&#x27;d spent less because I don&#x27;t think I got much other than looks for the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;EDITED after dental checkup:  my last checkup, after using this brush exclusively, was terrible!  This brush simply doesn&#x27;t clean as well as other, less expensive, Sonicare products.  It&#x27;s all style over substance and a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush! I&#x27;ve always been fond enough of regular, old-fashioned brushes, but I don&#x27;t think I could go back again. My teeth always feel irresistibly clean once I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s like a trip to the dentist every single time I brush my teeth. It&#x27;s a little tickle-y, but you get used to it quickly. It fits comfortably in my hands, making it easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with the toothbrush, the base, 2 brush heads, and a hard travel case. It&#x27;s easier to just leave it charging on the base regularly, so I have yet to really test out the claim that the charge lasts up to 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it times everything for me. It times your brushing in 30 second increments, so you can brush a different part of your mouth. It automatically turns off at the 2 minute mark. There are 3 different settings - clean, whiten, and gumcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase another in the future. Unfortunately, they are ridiculously expensive, but oh, so worth it.</li>
    <li> Only owned it for a few days but I could feel the difference immediately. I can tell that it&#x27;s cleaning my teeth much better than hand brushing ever could.  I like the variety of settings you can use to customize it to your needs and the fact that it comes with a travel case.</li>
    <li> Brushes are expensive, but this is a great instrument for keeping your teeth and gums healthy for life in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to receive a demo of this to try as my sonicare elite e9000 was about to kick the bucket after 7 years of heavy daily use (my wife and I are both sonicare users and swap brush heads).  The rubber button popped through the housing and the mold and slime encrusted toothpaste just got to be too much.  Serendipity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this review isn&#x27;t about that, it&#x27;s about newer &#x3D; better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all the main photo is misleading; the unit comes with a charging base, single brush head, and travel case.  That&#x27;s it.  No fancy UV sanitizer as one might assume from the photos.  At this price point I would think it&#x27;s deserving of one.  Especially because sonicare continues to be plagued by one main issue.  In fact, my biggest complaint is a problem similar to old toothbrushes: grime.  Old toothpaste, saliva, limescale, etc.  It just seems to build up in these toothbrushes no matter how diligent we are about cleaning it after each use.  And no, we&#x27;re not slobs, either.  This particular place tends to be a ring that forms around the tooth-brush head mount in the gap.  We clean it off after swapping the brushes, but it still accumulates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other observations:&lt;br /&gt;The pressure sensor is a nice feature; I find it kicks in every so often when I am brushing absentmindedly.  The quad pacer is nice, but it keeps going...I thought there was a stop function but if left alone it will run nonstop so I just shut it down after four beeps.  Also, I have tried all three settings: clean, gum care, and whiten and have noticed absolutely no difference in the brushing sensation, but maybe I&#x27;m not sensitive enough to notice different brush stroke patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this is a great toothbrush and I&#x27;m glad we own it.  Just be prepared for diligent work to keep it clean and toothpaste-buildup-free.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare FlexCare Platinum is superb!  I purchased this product to replace an old rechargeable Oral B toothbrush.  This brush is hands down the best.  The new technology in toothbrushes is amazing.  It tells me when I am brushing too hard and the timer makes sure that I brush long enough.  There are three intensity settings which is good for my sensitive teeth.  I must say, though, the high intensity setting may be a bit too powerful as toothpaste went flying when I opened by mouth while brushing.  Also the sonic technology helps remove plaque along the gumline and between teeth.  I have used only used the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;white\\&quot; settings.  There is a third setting for \\&quot;gum care\\&quot;  that adds one minute of gum massage to the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; setting.  To be honest, I really didn&#x27;t see a difference besides the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush comes with two brush heads, the charger base, and a travel case.  The travel case appears very sturdy and durable.  One drawback is that that I did not see any difference between  the included brushes to distinguish your brush if you are sharing the base.  Also the brush head does to meet flush with the base - there is a very small gap.  Hopefully it will not accrue too much build up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is on the more expensive side, but I believe it is well worth it.  My teeth feel a lot cleaner than with my previous brush.  I would completely recommend this product for anyone wanting a high quality, durable rechargeable brush.</li>
    <li> This is my second sonicare toothbrush.  We&#x27;ve had an e series for about 7 years (still going strong) that I got on the recommendation of my dentist.  I&#x27;ve always had dental issues, a tendency towards cavities and gum inflammation that runs in my family (I eat very little sugar, soda, or processed foods, it&#x27;s just bad genes).  I first tried to go cheap on the electric toothbrush but the toothbrush broke snd didn&#x27;t really seem to help much above using a regular toothbrush). so i finally caved and bought a sonicare.  Using the sonicare cleared up those issues, no cavities, little plaque, no gingivitis for the last 7 years. So I am a big fan of sonicare toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does the flexcare model compare?  I would say this cleans as well (perhaps a bit better) than our e series.  This model has the option of choosing the level of intensity which is helpful for new users.  It can take a little getting used to and it is helpful to start low and increase the intensity as you get used to using this.  If you are an experienced user, this is an unneeded feature.  This model also comes with a whitening mode and a gum care mode.  Honestly, I saw little benefit for these modes.  I have gum issues and the regular cleaning mode is sufficient for keeping my gums healthy. One feature on this that I do rally like is that this signals every 30 seconds when this is in cleaning mode.  This helps me make sure I clean each part of my mouth equally.  Also, I have been this for about a month and I do think the battery on this does go longer between charges than our older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intensity level choice is useful to new users. Can be skipped by more experienced users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built in timer is very handy.  My older model doesn&#x27;t have this and I wish I had paid a little more for this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra modes didn&#x27;t seem to offer much value.  I would try to find the version where you didn&#x27;t pay for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush cleans very well, Just as you would expect from a sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at upgrading to a sonicare, this flexcare series seems to be every bit as good as older ones.  Sonicare&#x27;s are  pricey but they last a long time.  If you are trying to decide whether you should upgrade from an older model, I would suggest waiting.  While they seem to clean a bit better, it&#x27;s a marginal Improvement.  Overall, this is another excellent offering from sonicare.well, Just as you would expect from a sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at upgrading to a sonicare, this flexcare series seems to be every bit as good as older ones.

    <li> As some here, I&#x27;m a previous Oral-B user not convinced with their new product line-up (Bluetooth on a toothbrush. Really?). After over seven years of heavy use and unparalleled service, my old Oral-B workhorse just gave up, motor was slow and grinding and the battery just didn&#x27;t hold its charge anymore. Time for a change, and after seven years technology I figured should have improved too, which in fact did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Sonicare over Oral-B? Well, I think Oral-B abandoned me and decided to go other route on their product line, none of their new toothbrushes convinced me at all to keep the brand. I take I comprise a very small segment of their customer base and they decided to go their growth is, which is a completely valid point. So they gave me the chance to try Sonicare and boy, how glad I am I did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a laser scalpel, plasma cutter vs. a manual saw comparison, a fine precision instrument vs. a rudimentary tool. Some may say -validly- that it is not fair to compare a seven year old toothbrush with a more modern one, but to be fair at least on paper and looks the new Oral-B models looked in some way like mine, minus the things I liked about them. This Sonicare is light, ergonomic and very easy to use, and it does a superior job than what my Oral-B did, which was already good but the results now are outstanding. For example, I&#x27;m a believer of the daily three steps for healthy mouth process: floss-brush-mouth rinse. I use a Waterpik for the first step, so just to see how good the Sonicare was I brushed first and then used the Waterpik: Almost no food residues or any type of debris whatsoever came out, which I take as a testament of the good job this Sonicare did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also way more silent than my Oral-B was, and at least on my Oral-B after about one minute of use liquid from the saliva-toothpaste mix started to run from my mouth -even closed- down the brush up to my hand, kind of disgusting but I thought that was normal for electric toothbrushes. It seems it is not normal, this doesn&#x27;t happen with the Sonicare so I take it was either a design flaw of my Oral-B or a manufacturing defect, not sure. But I&#x27;m pleased it is not happening anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons? Not really. One thing could be the inclusion of three sensitive modes and three cleaning modes, I wonder who will use other setting than the strongest one and play with the pressure of the brush in the mouth, it is something that comes with use so I see no point on the tress speeds. The other two cleaning modes, gums and whitening are also pointless, there is no relevant difference among the three modes at the speed this thing is vibrating it is just not physically possible I think. So probably Philips decided to include all this customization to charge more, or to please people that like to have several options on their products. My option is simplify and conquer, look where Apple is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very happy with my purchase. As per longevity, Philips gives you a 2.5 years full warranty (2 years standard, 6 more months if you register the product), which for a product like this, at this time of fast obsolescence and poor durability I consider it enough. 160 dollars for 900 days of at least twice a day brushing doesn&#x27;t sound bad at all. Granted, my Oral-B lasted for over 7 years, but is that normal? Maybe, who knows. Too late for me to find outbrushes.

    <li> This toothbrush broke within 1 month.  I feel like the quality of the Philips toothbrushes has significantly declined over the last several years.  I love it when it works, but this is the second toothbrush that broke.  I&#x27;m not sure that I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> After doing some research, I purchased this toothbrush and It is great! I was skeptical from negative reviews but there were more positives and other websites that compared it to the Diamond stated the Philips sonicare HX9110/02 is better because it has 3 speeds and Diamond has only one. My teeth feel very clean and look much brighter and my breath smells better. People should follow the instructions on how to use the toothbrush because it is not just any toothbrush. Great product and worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is the Rolls Royce of electric toothbrushes -- it is sleek and easy to hold, it keeps  a charge forever, it comes with a nifty travel case, and it has a total of nine different settings, so you can adjust your brushing setting every day of the week if you choose.  It also gets your teeth amazingly clean.  It&#x27;s a great toothbrush and you certainly won&#x27;t be disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I don&#x27;t think you would be disappointed in any of the Sonicare models --- and if cost is an issue -- you can get a great Sonicare at a fraction of the price of this one.  Granted, it won&#x27;t have the nine settings, and perhaps it will not have the sleek body, but it will get your teeth super clean.  I have another Sonicare model that is less than half the price of this one.  Frankly, I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference in the two models.  They are similar in looks, and I don&#x27;t sense any difference in the brushing experience between the two.  The less expensive model has a pearly white front.  The less expensive model has a single control button, which functions as an on-off switch and allows you to move between the three modes (clean, sensitive, and clean and white).  The more expensive model has a silvery front, and three separate control buttons -- an on-off button, a button that allows you to move to adjust the intensity level (there are three levels), and a third button that allows you to move between the three modes (clean, white, and gum care).  And the heads are different on the two models -- but they are interchangeable, so I expect you can choose from most of the available Sonicare heads when purchasing replacement heads, and find one that is best suited to your brushing style and your budget.  Both models hold a charge well -- my less expensive model purports to hold a charge for two weeks, whereas this model claims the charge will last three weeks.  Frankly, I think theses are undeerstimations, as in the month I&#x27;ve had this brush, I haven&#x27;t once had it on the charger, and it still shows a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want all the bells and whistles, and you don&#x27;t object to paying for them, by all means spring for the Flexcare Platinum.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  But if you&#x27;re wondering whether all the bels and whistles are worth it and you just want clean teeth, rest assured, you will be well-served by any Sonicare model you choose.charger, and it still shows a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want all the bells and whistles, and you don&#x27;t object to paying for them, by all means spring for the Flexcare Platinum.

    <li> Superb toothbrush!  I&#x27;ve owned two of the lesser Sonicare models, and this really stands out as the best. The body is smaller and easier to handle. It brushed more effectively and leaves my mouth feeling much cleaner than my last Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sonicare has three modes that clean, whiten and treat gums, along with an intensity adjustment.  I find no reason to lower the intensity but this would be useful for people with sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sonicare comes with a hard-sided travel case which is important if you travel. My first Sonicare came with a soft-sided case, which failed to protect it in my duffle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life of this Sonicare is really impressive.  I have been using it for close to two weeks without a recharge.  It&#x27;s really worth the extra cash for the upper end brush. You should be using it at least once a day, and the benefits are evident. I want to keep my original teeth forever.</li>
    <li> This one si special, with several programs --gum care, white to name a couple. It will also warn you if you are brushing too hard, which is nice. ( The instructions indicate to apply light pressure for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afer using the product for a few weeks I think the gums have improved, and it does give you a dazzeling bright smile.  As others have correctly mentioned, the feeling is very similar to what you get when you go to the dentist for a regular \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my dentist likes the unit, and mentioned that it was one of the best products on the market!</li>
    <li> Very powerful and I love the smaller heads that make it more maneuverable. I feel like I&#x27;m able to reach the more difficult to reach spots.  It&#x27;s better than my old Intellisonic that I got at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been a few weeks. i love my new toothbrush. it&#x27;s really made a difference in my smile. more later.</li>
    <li> My few years old Sonicare is finally dying, the battery is lasting only about 48 hours total. I was thrilled to try the latest model of the Sonicare: HX9110/02.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improvements over the former model that are most important to me are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 brushing intensities: high, medium and low (not 2 as in the former model)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 modes of cleaning: basic cleaning for plaque removal, whitening (new to this model, love this) and gum cleaning (not sure I need to use this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New pressure sensor: If you press too hard it will change in vibration and a sound change to let you know you need to ease up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy Start: When using high intensity brush mode (which I do not use), it gradually intensifies the pressure over 14 days so your gums are not shocked and wrecked in the process of adjusting to using the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features on both this model and the older model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quadpacer: beep and a pause to indicate you need to shift brushing to the next quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smarttimer: When turned on it brushes for 2 minutes then stops at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not advertised but very much appreciated: the brush attaches with a different style and this means the old problem of mildew and mold growing inside the toothbrush head cannot occur! When I moved from New England to Houston my old Sonicare instantly started growing mold which was just nasty. After using all kinds of cleaning methods including Q-Tips and hydrogen peroxide I discovered a $3 set of silicone sheaths here on Amazon and bought them to use. They helped lock out 95% of the moisture and the mold only grew a bit. I am THRILLED that this new style of brush does not have a large hollow shaft that moisture gets trapped in which can grow mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked and loved the old Sonicare despite its mold issue shortcoming so I absolutely love this new model which has new features and prevents the mold growing problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product 5 stars &#x3D; I Love It.&#x3D; I Love It.</li>
    <li> I am comparing this new Sonicare with an older, simpler toothbrush I used to have which was made by Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference between the two brands is the speed of vibration. The Oral B has a slower, more detectable pulse, while the Sonicare vibrates so fast that at first it feels as though it isn&#x27;t doing much of anything (which is definitely not the case!) It makes a high pitched buzzing sound, which, right next to one&#x27;s ear, may take a little getting  used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B model I used has several speeds and various brush heads. A separate device is used to help the user keep track of  the recommended brushing time of 30 seconds per quadrant of the mouth, and to alert one when pushing too hard with the toothbrush. The Sonicare has both of these functions built into the toothbrush unit, which some people may find more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare has 3 speeds or intensity levels.  Both brands have settings for whitening.  The main difference is that the Oral B pulses in a different rhythm for whitening.  In the time I have had the Sonicare, it is hard to tell whether the whitening has made a difference. The Sonicare also has an Easy Start feature to help the user ease into the new routine, and a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Sonicare and the Oral B do a really good job cleaning teeth. The Sonicare may more effectively clean between teeth, but otherwise, I think picking one over the other is a mostly a matter of personal taste. I tend to  prefer the slow, kind of rolling, massaging action of the Oral B.  It could be coincidence, but my teeth and jaw ached after the first few uses of the new Sonicare, even though I had used one years ago with no trouble, and did use the Easy Start feature.  Still, many people I know love the various Sonicare products and have used them for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summing up,  the Sonicare  has the high pitched buzz and extremely fast vibration. The Oral B makes more of a gentle roar and has a slower, pulsing motion. The Oral B I used has more bells and whistles, but the Sonicare has everything necessary for brushing built into the toothbrush unit. Both highly recommended, though for the reasons above, I think next time (and my experience with these toothbrushes is that they do wear out after a few years) I will gravitate toward the Oral B.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush that impressed me straight out of the box.  It has not one, but two brush heads, which means you won&#x27;t need a replacement for a while.  Also includes is a great, white storage case.  It has different speeds.  I preferred the highest speed.  However, those with highly sensitive teeth may prefer a lower setting.  At highest settings, the brush does the work for you as you don&#x27;t even need to scrub.  Instead, simply guide the brush back and front and side to side of your mouth.  It also does a decent job loosening plaque at the gum line, which is tough with a manual brush.  Once fully charged, the brush can last you for weeks.  It has a power level lights, which lets you know when its time to charge it again.  The charging stand is not space-consuming and charges your toothbrush in the upright position.  I have tried a similar toothbrush from Oral-B(Oral-B Smartseries 5000,) but found it a tad \\&quot;too-gimmicky\\&quot; with their \\&quot;SmartGuide\\&quot; system.  This Phillips is a no-gimmick, no nonsense, minimal effort and provides great results.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 5+ year-old Sonicare.  The older one cleaned just fine but the gasket-like rubber on/off button had torn off, making it hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most striking thing about the HX9110 is that it leaves my teeth noticeably cleaner than the one it replaces.  I almost can&#x27;t wait for my next dentist appointment to see if my hygienist notices (she&#x27;s the one who recommended the original Sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older model had a &amp;#34;hollowed out&amp;#34; section where the brush head was placed.  The design trapped water and the inside had to be cleaned out regularly to prevent moldy build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model is a completely different design.  The brush head is now mounted onto a spindle with no well to collect water.  That Philips went back to the drawing board on the brush mount really impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had a chance to play with settings for &amp;#34;Clean,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Gum Care.&amp;#34;  But I have noticed when the pressure gauge senses that I&#x27;m pressing too hard: the motor slows down a bit to prevent damaging my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HS9110 is pricey.  But so far I can&#x27;t see a problem with the industrial or functional design.  And it gets my teeth noticeably cleaner than the previous model.</li>
    <li> I was a long time user of Oral-B electric toothbrushes, but made the switch to Phillips several years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back since. The main difference between the two makers, as far as I can tell, is the way the brush head oscillates or vibrates. On Phillips, the entire brush head is a solid piece that vibrates rapidly back and forth along the shaft, sending the vibration up to the tip of the brush. On Oral-B, the head rotates back and forth while the shaft remains motionless. As far as which is more efficient, I&#x27;m unable to say. What&#x27;s for sure is that Sonicare brushes are quieter and for this reason, I like them better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own 2 other Sonicares ([[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], [[ASIN:B000AMRII0 Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush]]) and this one is by far the most sophisticated. Inside the box are 2 brush heads, a very sleek looking travel case that looks like it came out of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and a charger base. The packaging is almost entire recyclable, being made mostly of paper with a PETE (type 1 plastic) pack inside holding the brushes. Kudos to Phillips for using eco-friendlier packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upgrades: The handle has 3 gentleness settings and 3 brushing modes (Clean, Whitening, and Gum Care). The default is Clean mode (2 mins) and durations increase 30 seconds with each successive mode. I prefer to keep it on Gum Care to massage my gums and leave them feeling squeaky and tingly. If you are new to Sonicare products, they may tickle the first few days you use them, so it is advisable to start off on gentle. To guard against hard brushing, which can damage enamel, the sound and feel of the brush changes when you press too hard. I find the pressure needed to trigger this is a bit too hard though. My other brushes by Sonicare do not have gentleness settings or the hard brushing indicator. Cleaning is very easy and it&#x27;s advised to remove the brushhead and rinse the connection point once a week in warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another upgrade, the battery level indicator has 3 dots, showing the current charge left. The less expensive Sonicares just have 1 light that blinks once the battery is low. The back of the brush handle is textured with hundreds of little raised dots for grip. Strangely, this brush will not charge if I set it on the charger from one of my other brushes. My other brushes will charge when put on the Flexcare&#x27;s charger however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare Platinum certainly is a luxurious electric toothbrush, but I think it&#x27;s not a great value for your money. For the price, I think it should have included the UV sanitizer as well. Are the extra bells and whistles worth the upgrade?

    <li> As users of many different toothbrushes over the years, including some of the latest sonicare models, this one is truly a step up. It&#x27;s expensive, there&#x27;s no getting around that. Over it&#x27;s predecessors, it&#x27;s a huge step up. The extended bristles make for much easier penetration in between teeth and give that &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34; feeling after brushing. The charge seems to last 2-3 weeks so far in between charges. No problems with mold or funk around the base of the brush as in previous models. The various modes they&#x27;ve introduced are a nice touch, but we don&#x27;t use them mush in all honesty. The features added that have been very helpful are the sensor that lets you know when your brushing too hard, and the little pulse that it gives out when you have spent enough time brushing one quadrant of your mouth. If I can say one thing that is the biggest improvement it&#x27;s the rate at which this new design vibrates, allowing for a much better removal of plaque. The carrying case is great to have when on the go, and the new charging base is easy to keep clean. Although the price is on the very high end, it&#x27;s a piece of technology that will last for years to come. If anyone has any questions leave a comment and I&#x27;ll do my best to answer. We did a lot of research and will help pass on any info.</li>
    <li> I could not find a suitable manual toothbrush, so I bought this. My gums are no longer bleeding when I brush. This is a great toothbrush. I chose this one over the oral-b because the oral-b you have to learn how to use it (according to reviews)  and I wanted something that was pretty straightforward. I haven&#x27;t tried all the different modes, but so far I like this toothbrush. The only thing is the brush head is small so after you&#x27;ve done the gum line and the two minutes you still have to brush some more.</li>
    <li> For years, my dental hygienist had recommended a Sonicare toothbrush.  I could not see spending that type of money on a toothbrush.  After my last visit, I relented and bought one.  I have used it for about a month and I am thoroughly impressed with this product.  It cleans teeth, removes plaque and really gets in between the teeth. I expect a much better visit when I go back to the dentist.</li>
    <li> We had the older model for many years. It was fine, but this is a quantum leap forward. It does a much better job.</li>
    <li> Love it, does a super job!</li>
    <li> The product is great, exactly what I ordered.  The problem arose when I thought I was getting a UPS delivery but the item was turned over to the USPS for delivery.  UPS delivers directly to my home in Idaho, where I was residing for the holidays.  Usually I live in the South for the winter and my mail is forwarded.  So, when the post office got the parcel, they forwarded it to Denver, Bell Gardens, CA, and then to Las Vegas.  That process took over two weeks, caused considerable anxiety since it arrived the day before Christmas.  All ended well, but it would be nice to be able to specify parcels over not be turned over to the postal service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of this electric toothbrush and loved it.  It quit after the warranty was up  and could not be reparied.  I pried it open to extract the battery so I could recycle it and was amazed at the inner workings of the thing.  It was quite extraordinary.  I had bought a Flexcare Plus, thinking I was getting a brush that cleaned 7 times the plaque of an ordinary brush and was surprised when I learned that it only cleaned 2 times.  Sl I bought this one and relegated the Flexcare Plus to a travel brush and got rid of my first ever Sonicare (eSeries). Of note is that the Sonicare Plus came with the Pro Results brushes, and I decided to call Sonicare about it.  It turns out, according to the person I spoke with, that the secret to the plaque removal is in the brush design and that I could use the newer brushes on the Platinum Plus toothbrush.  So I rushed out and bought some diamond care brushes, the latest advancement for them.  My wife changed from using Oral B electric to the Sonicare Flexcare Platinum and had her best checkup ever last month.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare was more than I expected, it does a great job in cleaning your teeth and keeping your gums healthy.</li>
    <li> Wore out the old Sonicare finally, after several years. This model is great, it cleans my teeth so much better from the older models and competitors&#x27; brushes I have tried/ used.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for years.  I have always found them to be consistently good products.  This new model is no exception.  Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;- The new brush heads have some longer bristles and it really does feel like they reach spots between my teeth better.&lt;br /&gt;- There is now a sensitivity option that gives you three settings.  My old Sonicare just had a sensitive setting that could not be combined with the other settings such as Gum Care.  On this one, you can adjust your sensitivity setting and select one of the other options as well.&lt;br /&gt;- It has Gum Care, White, and Clean options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;- It does not come with a sanitizer.  Usually Sonicare toothbrushes at this price include a sanitizer, so it was a bit disappointing that it wasn&#x27;t included on this model.&lt;br /&gt;- The toothbrush heads no longer have colored rings around the bottom, which is how my husband and I would tell our toothbrushes apart.  This is a pretty minor issue, but it requires that we have assigned spots on the toothbrush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great toothbrush. If you already have a Sonicare that you bought recently, I don&#x27;t know if the improvements on this are so huge as to warrant upgrading.  However, if you don&#x27;t have a Sonicare or have an old one, I definitely recommend purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a very good electric toothbrush. This toothbrush has three intensity levels (low, medium, high) and three brushing modes (clean, whitening, gum) to customize to your needs and situation. All the modes and levels doesn&#x27;t seem to shake/vibrate as much (compare to my other non sonicare electronic toothbrush. e.g. oral-b etc), but if I pay attention closely I can see that the brush is moving really really fast, probably at a supersonic speed, hence the sonic name :) .  I do feel that my teeth is a lot cleaner after using this philiips sonicare toothbrush compared to brushing using a manual brush.  This set comes with 1 handle, 2 brush heads with caps, a case and a charger (that can also charge some other philips product like the air floss etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidarta Tanu</li>
    <li> Merchandising always fascinates me.  I have this toothbrush to review for vine.  It has 3 speeds, 3 brushing \\&quot;modes\\&quot;,  I don&#x27;t know how many different brush heads and attachments.  Do I benefit from all these options, or are they there to upsell me to the Ultra Sooper Titanium Turbo version?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case of the Sonicare Flex Platinum, I&#x27;d say that most of what \\&quot;comes with\\&quot; is useful.  I can remember being a newbie to rotating/oscillating (Oral B) and vibrating (Sonicare) electric toothbrushes and finding the feeling of the moving bristles being distinctly uncomfortable.  Not so much these days - my husband and I have gone back and forth between Sonicare and Oral B for years - but I can appreciate the value of having a lower intensity setting for the uninitiated, and of course for the sensitive.  The quadpacer setting that is part of all three cleaning \\&quot;modes\\&quot; is actually very useful.  It&#x27;s not just kids who don&#x27;t brush long enough!  I could see right away with the Sonicare that I had previously been kidding myself about always brushing a full 2 minutes with my prior, non-timed, Oral-B.  So okay, you could just turn it on for another two minutes to allow time for special attention to the gums, or \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; - but all things (including price) being equal (which of course they aren&#x27;t), I can see the convenience of being able to \\&quot;program\\&quot; another minute or half minute with the touch of a button.  Just be aware that if those niceties aren&#x27;t in your budget, it&#x27;s still a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Sonicare makes an absolute bare bones model, the [[ASIN:B000FEIOHW Philips Sonicare HX3351/02 Xtreme Battery Operated Toothbrush]], which I recently obtained for my husband.  The e3000 relies on AA batteries vs. the rechargeable lithiums that power the rest of their line.  (In some ways preferable - I HATE throwing away a device or appliance because the battery is non-replaceable.)  No timer or intensity setting with the basic model, and it does use the e-Series heads that I don&#x27;t love (more on that, below), but it&#x27;s every bit a Sonicare, and I&#x27;d just advise you to read the reviews on Amazon of this budget-end Sonicare if you do consider it. It requires a bit of specialized (but easy) TLC to make the battery compartment watertight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back to the unit at hand.  Stylistically, it&#x27;s a little sleeker, and a little more ergonomic than my last Sonicare.  The trim is silver, the handle has a nubby \\&quot;grip\\&quot; pad on the back; I won&#x27;t drop it by accident.  (Well, not often.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is somewhat sleeker as well than what I was used to with my last Sonicare.  The Eseries heads were quick to \\&quot;gunk up\\&quot; with nasty, germy, moldly deposits, however often I would sanitize them.  (I would do so in a weak bleach solution, not the more recently developed home EV units.)  These slide onto the unit with just enough resistance between the fittings to suggest some improved degree of leak-resistance, but only extended months of use can tell the whole story there.  In the meanwhile, I&#x27;m doing what many reviewers suggest and using the finger of a drugstore latex glove to protect against seepage between powerhead and base.  (Again, see reviews on various Sonicare units for that hack - or you can buy [[ASIN:B001S2PLNK The Sonic Seal for E-Series Sonicare Replacement Heads, 3 Count (Blue, Pink, Frost)]], available in various color palettes.  A bit pricey, but less so than having to constantly replace brush heads before their time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, only time will tell how reliable this unit is.  I&#x27;ve had a spotty history with Sonicare, some units breaking practically minutes out-of-warranty, driving me back to Oral-B again.  But you know, the dentists like Sonicare better.  It feels like it does more.  You can spend all day researching these things but I know I&#x27;m not sure which Is better.  Truth to tell, durability and easy maintenance mean more to me than style or \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; settings and features, so until one of these electric brush manufacturers comes out with a five year warranty and a brush head assembly that is guaranteed 100% watertight on the unit, I&#x27;ll remain somewhat fickle about my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Flexcare Platinum IS a really nice one.sh manufacturers comes out with a five year warranty and a brush head assembly that is guaranteed 100% watertight on the unit, I&#x27;ll remain somewhat fickle about my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Flexcare Platinum IS a really nice one.</li>
    <li> Pros: Speed &#x3D; more brushes per second, Cleaning programs, Intensity adjustment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is quite packed with features that your average manual toothbrush can only dream to attain. First, the speed. This thing gives you so many brushes per second there is just no way you could do it manually. Equals a much better clean in the same amount of time. The unit has 3 different cleaning programs, and 3 different intensities. Program 1) Clean - Continuous brushing Program 2) White - 2 minutes of whitening mode and 30 seconds to brighten and polish Program 3) GumCare 2 minutes of Clean mode and 1 minute of gentle gum massage I love the 3 intensity adjustments from gentle to fast. Most of the time I just set it on 3, but it is nice to be able to turn down the intensity when I am either not in the mood for a hard brush, or if my teeth are feeling sensitive in the morning. In summary, I was very happy with the toothbrush and the experience. 5/5</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sort of addicted to this thing. I started using it, then forgot to take it with me when I went camping. It felt like withdrawals. Holy moly, this thing makes my mouth feel good. Most pearly-feeling teeth ever.</li>
    <li> Except for the noise, I like this electric toothbrush very much. It provides that clean teeth feeling that you have after a professional cleaning. The noise is not worse than other brands that I have tried or read reviews of. I just wished they could make it much quieter. I used a Braun for many years until it broke and although I was pleased with it, I am now glad that it finally broke down because this Philips Sonicare is better. I had to order it online because I wanted the Platinum version for the sensitive setting and not one store within 15 miles stocked it. It took a little while to get used to even the lowest setting; at first it vibrated and tickled my gums too much. I&#x27;m very sensitive but it only took a few uses to get comfortable. The head is small enough for me; many brands have large heads that are too large for people with small mouths and small jaws. The handle part is easy to hold on to (I have arthritis) and not too large or too heavy. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this and I finally broke down and got me one.  I can honestly say my teeth have never felt so clean.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it works great, so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.  The battery last for about two weeks before you have to recharge it.  The replacement brush heads are about ten dollars apiece, but bottom line your teeth are worth it.</li>
    <li> Had a Sonicare quite some time ago (old screw the brush on style). Happy to finally get newer version. Excellent toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I made the leap for an electric toothbrush after a recent visit to the dentist&#x27;s office, when my hygienist told me I had gingivitis (and a couple cavities, youch!) and needed to take better care of my teeth. It was embarrassing, but she was right. She didn&#x27;t directly suggest buying a Sonicare, even though they sell them in the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around a little bit and chose to buy from Amazon after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It holds a charge for three weeks with 2-3 daily use, which is incredibly convenient if you&#x27;re on the road a lot, because you don&#x27;t have to bring the charging stand with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It has three speeds AND three different cleansing methods -- clean, whitening, and gum care. Top speed is still a bit aggressive for me, but the lower two levels are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It has 30-second intervals to help you give proper care to each quadrant of your mouth. This is honestly my favorite feature. I forgot my toothbrush the other day and had to do it the old fashioned way... what a chore! But worst of all, I had no sense of how long to properly brush my teeth and, when finished, could FEEL how much less clean they were compared to a post-Sonicare brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It comes with two brush heads (distinguished by a dark dot or white square) so you can share with your boyfriend/girlfriend, whatever. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always considered myself someone who had sensitive gums. In fact, I was always amazed by people whose gums didn&#x27;t bleed while flossing or occasionally while brushing. Stupid me. My hygienist told me this was a sign of gum infection. After a cleaning and a month of the Sonicare, my gums literally NEVER bleed, even after a vigorous brushing (even at level 3 -- I just don&#x27;t like how it feels) and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that this toothbrush limits those uncomfortable visits to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for who&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what do you like</li>
    <li> ....but don&#x27;t need all the varying controls that probably don&#x27;t do a heck of a lot. It&#x27;s a toothbrush! End.</li>
    <li> We love this toothbrush! The different settings help to give each family member their own custom brushing. The older model we had was problematic because one of the buttons was in the way while brushing but this one doesn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric toothbrush in an effort to keep my teeth and gums healthy.  I was hesitant to buy this because it&#x27;s pricey but compared to what a dentist visit and dental repairs would cost me it&#x27;s a decent price.  I absolutely love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 3 settings for intensity, 3 brushing programs; clean, white and gums.  All is easy to change to suit your needs.  Automatic 2 minute brushing.  It beeps at 30 second intervals to change the brushing area.  Great feature!  My teeth feels so clean and my gums are tingly.  It comes with 2 brush heads.  I love the size, it&#x27;s perfect.  The charger is small and seems to charge quickly.  Before using for the first time the instructions says it takes 24 hours to charge but mine was ready within 15 hours.  Comes with a travel case too.  Worth every penny.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. My teeth feel so clean after using it.  It&#x27;s just a bit pricy. Why do small appliances fall apart so soon?  My old Phillips Sonic only lasted 3 years</li>
    <li> The Flexcare Platinum tooth brush is a great improvement over the original Sonicare  model.  It&#x27;s features really make for sparkling teeth,</li>
    <li> I used to have the older Sonicare toothbrush, The Essence series.  I like the fact that you have three different intensity levels to choose from. Low , medium and high intensity.  You also have three cleaning modes to choose from, Clean, White and Gum care.  Clean is the default mode and brushes for 2 minutes ( 30 seconds for each of four sections in your mouth). White cleans for 2 minutes and an extra 30 seconds for polishing.  Gum care combines clean mode with and extra minute to gently  stimulate gums.  You have to choose the mode before you start brushing, but you can toggle between intensities during your brushing.  I like the brush head also compared to my older toothbrush.  The head has more tightly compacted bristles and is a lot easier to clean than the older style tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing toothbrush and permiates of quality.  Unlike, the Oral-B toothbrushes thats brushes rotate, the Sonicare is a very gentle rub that is much softer on the gums.  Mine holds a charge for weeks at a time.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the gentle quality of this brush.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for a week now and I can tell a difference from a manual toothbrush.  I wish I had gotten something like this years ago as it would save me a lot of time and hassle with the dentist.</li>
    <li> i used oral b forever and never thought i would switch to another brand until my husband did a little research and decided to give this brush a try, so bought one too. Right off the bat i could tell my teeth were getting a better clean. the vibration is much stronger on this brush than my former one and my teeth feel squeaky clean after first rinse. I also love the timer, which helps me get every part of my mouth evenly ( without it i tend to dwell in certain areas and quickly pass overs)</li>
    <li> If used per the instructions, which are intuitive, it&#x27;s obvious why this  device is so effective -- especially at the gum-line.  High-ly recommended by my dentist as a very effective way to prevent build-up of tartar.  You&#x27;ll &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; that as you use it.  Keep handle horizontal during use; no need to use traditional brush strokes, or to press &amp;#34;hard.&amp;#34;  I think the results will be remarkable -- and I thought my brushing techniques were already thorough.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before, so there is some getting used to (the toothbrush does all the \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; for you, all you have to do is guide it from one side to the next).  I have only used it a few times, and my teeth already feel so much cleaner.  It&#x27;s an elegant toothbrush, yet very sturdy; definitley looks like what it costs.  There&#x27;s a two minute timer on it, it actually shuts off, and that takes some getting used to, too; however, there is a little tip:  The extra feautres on the toothbrush (whitens, gum care), which in the beginning sort of intimidated me, I later realized it basically just adds some time to your two minutes before shutting off. So I recommend you choose either of these two features when you first start using it. To the newbies like me, it will just give you more time to become familiar with it, allowing you to complete brushing your whole mouth before it turns off. Later on, I am sure it will be a feature I will choose once or twice a week, if I want an extra round for my gums or if I want to just focus on the biting surfaces of my teeth. You may think that two minutes isn&#x27;t enough, (it seems that way in the beginning!) but this is very different than your average manual toothbrush.  I am still trying to get used to it, but you also have to worry about over brushing, which dentists always tend to stress to people.  To those of you who do decide to buy it, don&#x27;t forget to register the product online, you will immediately add 6 months to the warranty.  It&#x27;s an expensive item, so this motivates you to take a chance and splurge on your teeth.  I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> Previously had an oral-b toothbrush and wanted a change, i feel the sonicare platinum gives a better clean while improving gum health as well.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of cleaning, however, gripping the handle often engages the intensity control, necessitating readjustment to desired strength.  The diamond shaped brush heads are a comfortable size and I also like the way they engage into the handle.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush was exactly what I expected after spending time researching the purchase.  Instructions were clear and design was easy to adapt to when brushing teeth.  I did have a problem with one of the brushes that was included in the purchase,  I did contact Phillips Sonicare and they replaced it immediately.</li>
    <li> Really like sensor for when pressing to hard.  Got mainly for the gum care.  Can see an improvement in 3 weeks</li>
    <li> There is no better powered brush. I have wasted my money on the competition -- but never again.</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing electric toothbrush.  I absconded with Sonicare and expensive brands for the $10 drugstore ones, and there&#x27;s just no comparison.  This is adequately \\&quot;abraisive\\&quot;, in that the vibrations are strong enough to actually clean your teeth.  My gums are sensitive, and I don&#x27;t have any problems.  I generally prefer the standard setting, where you spend 30s on each quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love how the battery lasts forever between charges - it&#x27;s done me well over several long trips.  Really, I never thought I&#x27;d be so impressed by a toothbrush of all things.</li>
    <li> 1ST electric toothbrush ever. We really love it thus far. It gives you that just came home from the dentist feeling and thanks to the two heads in this kit I am able to use the same brush handle and different heads for me and my fiance. We love it so much we plan on gifting one as a wedding present to my brother in law and his new wife !:)</li>
    <li> Warning, as some others have commented the battery will be dead after 13 months. It will charge up, show a full charge, then I will use it one time then the battery will be completely dead. The little LED&#x27;s will lite up on the mode/setting but the battery LED will flash and will not work. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It was a good purchase.  It really does a nice job of providing a clean brush without being overly harsh on sensitive teeth. I would recommend to any friend looking for a &#x27;step up&#x27; in class...</li>
    <li> Oh Baby!!! As a faithful Braun customer, I have been converted by the joys of Sonicare!!!  It is so good I cannot turn back, my teeth feel so clean it is hard to believe that OralB is still in business, given the competition.  Time will tell about the durability and robustness of the product but right now, there is no turning back</li>
    <li> I previously owned an Oral-B electric toothbrush but my periodontist recommended the Sonicare because the brush head vibrates (the Oral-B rotates) and therefore, is easier on your tooth enamel and gums.  I tend to brush too hard and this toothbrush has a signal to let you know when you are pushing too hard.  WalMart sells this particular toothbrush but charges over $200.  Over all, I just love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars, (instead of 5), because when spending upwards of $150.00 for a toothbrush, (including some discounts), I&#x27;d expect it to completely whiten teeth, then correct years of periodontal disease overnight, (so we&#x27;d all look like the young models on TV)--however it doesn&#x27;t, but I feel I&#x27;m on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare is a serious product in the field of dental care--you can feel its power the first time you use it.  For example, if you don&#x27;t hold it exactly as instructed, and the handle should touch your teeth, you can rattle your whole mouth in an eye-opening way. It really pays to read the instructions before using the product in order to get the maximum benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DO feel like you are giving your mouth a work-out and your teeth are completely cleaned each time you use it.  The design is such that it is easy to reach everywhere to get all the hidden spots.  When reading about the different models before ordering, I was a bit concerned that the features seemed relatively complicated, what with all the &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34; and intensities, and I was afraid I&#x27;d only use a couple of the features, but the unit is extremely well designed, and its use is intuitive and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare has the feel of a quality instrument in your hands, and the materials and workmanship make it worth what you pay.  A lot of thought and effort was put into the product, (there is a built-in timer), so you quickly learn how long to stay in each area, and when you&#x27;re finished, you feel confident that the best possible cleaning has been done,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, easy to reach &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; places, and you will use all the features and appreciate the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duane</li>
    <li> I used a Rotodent toothbrush for 10 years and this purchase was the replacement. I am very happy with the brushes capability to effectively clean my teeth and help maintain healthy gums. My Hygienist saw an improvement in my overall at home maintenance. The travel container is very good when you are away from home.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush can be very messy to use especially when using the highest setting. Be sure to lean over the sink while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The stand that is provided to coil your charging cord when not in use is cumbersome and does not handle the entire cord.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with my decision to buy this brush.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a Sonicare toothbrush and I cannot say enough positive things about it! Teeth feel cleaner then ever and plaque build up when flossing is almost nothing. I also had the beginnings of bone loss/periodontal infection on my last visit to the dentist and that has completely cleared up.</li>
    <li> Cleaning ability is great.  However, two of the LEDs went out so you couldn&#x27;t tell what mode you were on.  In addition, the rubber boot under the toothbrush head will mold over very easily and eventually fail, letting in water.  Now I have a failed $150 tooth brush after 3 years.  They should last longer.  A call to Sonicare resulted in a 15% discount in another ridiculously priced toothbrush.  They do not have a replacement boot.  Really!  This would take a few minutes to replace, but instead, I have to buy another unit.  Forget that, I will invest in one of the many other similar toothbrushes for a fraction of the price.  By the way, the heads are ridiculous too at close to 10 bucks each.  They last the same time as a standard toothbrush but at 2 to 3 times the cost.  Ridiculous!!  This is my last.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the Sonicare and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  My teeth feel cleaner than ever before and it makes brushing a pleasure to be looked forward to instead of a tedious chore.  I find that I am brushing more often and for longer durations than I ever have.  This is one of those small purchases (although not cheap) that really enhance your life and will probably save you money on future dental bills.</li>
    <li> My dentist had been telling me for a bout a year that this was the toothbrush for me since I don&#x27;t always seem to remember to floss and my gums are a little sensitive.  So after searching around for the best price - which was amazon of course, I gave in and bought it.  It was a little funny to get used to but after about a week it feels absolutely normal.  It&#x27;s nice that it has the different settings and it makes a little noise if I press too hard on my gums.  So, working great so far! I was even able to go about a week without having to charge it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has extremely disappointed in terms of durability, and has no warranty. I have had cheaper versions that lasted longer than this one, which broke after 6-months of use. It will not charge, which is quite disappointing because it actually cleans well. I was mostly impressed by the additional gum care option. Too bad I cannot enjoy it, and for such a high price (and short use ability), I will definitely NOT be purchasing another Philips toothbrush again. The two stars are because it actually cleans well, but I didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> The pressure sensor helps the brush-heads last for so so long and I brush my teeth way better with the ability to not brush too hard. Best sonicare toothbrush yet, the sensor is worth the money. I&#x27;ve had every sonicare for the past 10 years, and the pressure sensor really is worth the upgrade.</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 Sonicare toothbrushes and this is by far the absolute best!  Unfortunately, they do die after a few years, but they&#x27;re still worth it.  This one is so strong and powerful, and it has a beautifully sleek design.  When I go to the dentist, they always tell me there&#x27;s barely anything for them to clean, and I know this time they&#x27;ve got to say it&#x27;s even less plaque and buildup than ever!  I&#x27;ve recommended Sonicare brushes for years and not have several family members and friends using them.  They are definitely expensive, but they&#x27;re also very worth it.</li>
    <li> Coming from the Flexcare Plus (one of several Sonicares I have had; the metal post that you attach the brushhead to fell out... couple months after warranty ended... of course) the Platinum is not much of an upgrade.  It has less &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34; although it does add the &amp;#34;intensity&amp;#34; toggle/settings.  That said, I rarely used any of the &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34; other than the default &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; - nor do I have any need for the different intensity settings.  (for those with sensitive teeth this would be a nice addition though... of course the Plus model had a separate &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; mode, so all in all there is likely zero difference between the functionality of the two units; but one more &amp;#34;step&amp;#34; needed to get what you want on the Platinum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the intensity setting toggle switch - it is very easy to change speeds unintentionally while brushing when your hand/palm brushes against it.  The mode cannot be changed while brushing - this should have been the case for intensity as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean mode automatically turns off after two minutes - same as it has always been, to be fair - which is annoying because I generally need about 3 minutes to thoroughly brush.  (their own instruction manual states that the recommended brushing time is &amp;#34;AT LEAST 2 minutes&amp;#34;)  Yes, the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;gum care&amp;#34; modes add 30/60 seconds respectively, but the brushhead action seems different than full power/clean.  The manual is extremely vague on what exactly the differences are, and the website does not provide additional detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is no improvement over the Plus - a two plus year old Plus at that.  As stated, I brush about three minutes twice a day, so I don&#x27;t expect 3 weeks of life, but I am down to two out of three &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; on the battery indicator after using it exactly 5 times.  (yes I let it charge for 24 hours initially)  Assuming 3 weeks of advertised battery life at 2 minutes twice a day, that would be 42 uses - 14 per week/per third of battery life. With my 3 minute brushings I should still expect about 9 uses before the battery moved down to 2/3 full.  (understood battery indicators are not perfect)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It LOOKS nice.  (as did the Plus - significantly different, but both are attractive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, for someone that has never had an electric toothbrush before, or has an Oral-B, I do recommend Sonicare.  It is better than manual brushing, and (for me) gentler on my gums (at full power) than the oscillating Oral-B brushes.  I would recommend the Plus model, however.  (or whichever is cheaper; bear in mind both models are available with and without the UV sanitizer, so make sure to compare apples to apples in that regard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps... speaking of the UV sanitizer, I still have it from my Plus model, so did not need it with the Platinum.  Also, if it is actually THAT effective/important, you have to ask yourself why for a toothbrush this expensive, why they even offer it WITHOUT it.  If you are paying this much, what is another twenty bucks?  (unless they know it will outlive the toothbrush so they assume you will keep using it after you replace the actual brush.... hmmmmm)  ;)</li>
    <li> Does anyone really need an electric toothbrush that offers nine different brushing options? This is an excellent toothbrush, for sure, but two or three setting would be more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips makes an excellent product: a rechargeable, electric toothbrush that lasts for years and does a very fine job of providing clean teeth and healthy gums.&lt;br /&gt;How do you get consumers to purchase a new toothbrush when the old one is perfectly adequate? Keep on coming up with new, improved, must have features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Three brushing modes&lt;br /&gt;  a) Clean. This is the normal, two minute brushing experience. It is the only mode that most folks will ever use.&lt;br /&gt;  b) White. This is the Clean mode plus 30 seconds to \\&quot;polish the front teeth\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  c) GumCare: This is the Clean mode plus 1 minute of \\&quot;gentle gum massage\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Three intensity level settings&lt;br /&gt;  a) Low (for extreme sensitivity)&lt;br /&gt;  b) Medium&lt;br /&gt;  c) High. If you already are used to a Sonicare brush, you will start with this intensity and stay with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Deluxe charger. This is a nice, but not necessary feature. You can wrap any excess cord inside the charger case. Also, a smaller \\&quot;travel\\&quot; charger is cleverly hidden inside. To dispense with bathroom counter clutter, I just use the \\&quot;travel\\&quot; charger. For the last year or so, Sonicare products have been using interchangeable chargers. This is terrific news as you only need to have one charger on the counter at any given time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Three week battery life. This longer battery life is probably the best of the new features. You can take your brush on a two week vacation, for instance, and never have to re-charge it. The \\&quot;travel\\&quot; charger is thus pretty much unnecessary for most travel situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Quadpacer and Smartimer. The brush vibrates every 30 seconds and then turns itself off after 2 minutes. The idea is that after 30 seconds you are to move to a different dental quadrant. This can be helpful if you are vacantly staring at your reflection in the bathroom mirror while you mentally rehash the discussion you had with your boss the day before. At least you know when the two minutes of brushing time has been accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Pressure Sensor. Alerts you when you are brushing too hard! See #5 above concerning daydreaming while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Huge plastic hard case for travel. Previous models of Sonicare brushes came with soft plastic pouches to use when you take your brush on the road. This new case is ridiculously large but it would prevent any damage to the brush as well as prevent the brush from accidently being turned on while bouncing around in a suitcase. You may not be able to pack a second pair of shoes, but your Sonicare brush will be protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Two new InterCare brush heads. These new style brush heads are really excellent and I highly recommend getting them for your existing Sonicare brush. Unlike ProResults or DiamondClean heads, InterCare brush heads have three rows of longer bristles at the center of the head. I find that they do a better job of reaching in between teeth and routing out plaque and other undesirable bits. The price for these new heads is really astronomical (about 13 dollars apiece) but should come down to Earth eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle of this new model has been slightly redesigned. The on/off button is placed slightly lower on the handle and I find that I am no longer accidentally hitting the button with my thumb and turning off the brush while I use it. This is greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are new to Sonicare or need to replace an old electric toothbrush, this is definitely a top of the line model.&lt;br /&gt;If you already have a Sonicare, go find the InterCare brush heads.

    <li> I bought this to replace an older Oral B electric toothbrush that had a battery that would not hold a charge anymore. My wife and kids all use Philips and so it made sense for me to switch over. I bought this model because I am very concerned about gum loss due to brushing too hard while in my mid 20&#x27;s.  I used it for a couple weeks before a dental cleaning and received a good report about my teeth being clean and my gums looking healthy. Of course I also had good results with the Oral B so I would attribute this to using an electric toothbrush in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with 2 brush heads which is nice. You can also change the intensity level and customize the mode very easily. I have only used the gum care mode though. This mode works by doing a regular cleaning for all four zones and then reduces the intensity to go over the gums four the four zones. I am very happy with this toothbrush. I probably could have bought a lesser version and been just fine, but I am not always good at flossing and I&#x27;m hoping the extra time on my gums will help.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an upgrade when an older Sonicare that I have had for 6 years began to pass away. I have sworn by these things since I first started using them. As far as this model goes, I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as solid in my hand as my other one did. Normally, consumers enjoy lighter products as things evolve, but when it comes to a toothbrush, I like to have a little weight so that it doesn&#x27;t slip from my hands. Once you get used to that, it&#x27;s fine...just something that irked me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go into the different modes, as there is plenty of information about that, but I do like the options. It&#x27;s really just timing...the modes do do anything different from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted a star because of the price. I can&#x27;t see where this model is any better than the lesser model. I did get it on sale and with a coupon, which brought the price down, but I think it&#x27;s still a bit overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using these things, my dentist routinely remarks how clean my teeth are when I go for my semi-annual visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included carry case is very nice. I had a cloth one with my last brush, and when I traveled and the wet brush had to be in there for the trip home, it generally smelled sour by the time I got home. This plastic case seems to solve that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great toothbrush, and I will definitely be sticking with this line!</li>
    <li> Visible difference, even compared to my cheaper Sonicare. One of the most expensive yet BEST purchases Ive made in quite a while!</li>
    <li> I had had a high end Sonicare toothbrush, and knew what to expect.  This toothbrush exceeded my expectations at first.  Wow, my teeth and gums were so clean, no plague! However, after several months the toothbrush became less and less effective.  I changed the toothbrush head, and there was still no improvement.  I am contacting the company to see about getting a replacement.  Wish me luck.  I have had problems with gingivitis, and this was the only toothbrush that works; WHEN IT WORKS.  It is so bad, I have switched to a manual toothbrush.  I hope this gets resolved soon!</li>
    <li> We owned an Oral-B electric toothbrush for over 10 years.  It made trips to the dentist office much less intimidating.  After our second Oral-B died (after 8 years of faithful service), we decided to try the Sonicare Platinum.  It is amazing!  We both feel that our teeth are even cleaner than with the Oral-B.  I really liked our old toothbrush, but I love this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll leave cost considerations out of my review -- only you know if you are the kind of person with the kind of budget to spend this kind of money on a toothbrush.  What I know is that nobody I&#x27;ve met who has tried a Sonicare toothbrush has gone back to their old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an older Sonicare model, the Essence.  The new Flexcare Platinum and the Essence do a very similar job cleaning my teeth, although I do think the Intercare brush head does a slightly better job getting between the teeth, just as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare Platinum is slimmer and includes a smaller charging stand with a cord wrap (the cord wrap isn&#x27;t roomy enough for all the cord, though, so a lot of cord still hangs out if the stand and socket are adjacent, as mine are).  The stand also accommodates a second brush head, a handy feature if you share the brush, although you&#x27;ll have to figure out a way to differentiate the identical brush heads (unless your sense of romance makes that unnecessary...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model beeps every 30 seconds rather than simply hesitating (as the Essence does) to alert the user to move the brush to different teeth (top, bottom, front, back).  Users can also adjust the intensity and timing.  These were fun to play with, but I found myself settling for the defaults, which were similar to the Essence modes.  I think someone new to Sonicare brushes would like the Easy Start mode, though; I do remember an adjustment period when I first changed from a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the streamlined appearance of the brush and stand, and as mentioned, I think the brush head design does a slightly better job.  Initially, I set my old Essence aside in case I wanted to switch back to it.  Now, I&#x27;m looking for a new home for it, as the Flexcare Platinum is the clear winner.  Nevertheless, having tried both, I&#x27;d be hard pressed to spend nearly three times as much to get the Flexcare Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I highly recommend Sonicare toothbrushes, and everyone I know who has tried one prefers it.  My advice would be to jump into the Sonicare brand at whatever level your budget is comfortable with.</li>
    <li> Some might think the cost of an electric toothbrush is not worth the initial expense and the ongoing expense of replacement brush heads.  But after using a Sonicare for many years, I can tell you it is very much worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to get this new Sonicare electric toothbrush to replace my older, well used model.  I had been using another brand of electric toothbrush, which I liked, but ended up giving it to my husband.  The new Sonicare toothbrush has the durability I&#x27;ve come to expect from Sonicare but so much more than my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels more powerful but not too powerful that it would hurt when brushing sensitive gums since you can change the intensity of the brushing.  Overall, a great investment for healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel really clean and gums feel better....next cleaning will tell, I guess. Like everything about it so far. Better cleaning than the &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; electric brush</li>
    <li> This is one nice toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare fan since my dentist gave me my first more than a decade ago.  My old Flexcare was still going strong, but had developed a bad case of apparent smelly mold on the very bottom -- which I could not get out no matter how I scrubbed -- so I got this brush.  I am a happy camper now.  It really is the most thorough Sonicare product yet, feels great in the hand, comes with some rather snazzy accessories (though I doubt I&#x27;ll be using the very bulky travel case any time soon), and leaves my teeth looking and feeling very, very clean,  My only ding is that it seems to be losing its charge awfully quickly but I haven&#x27;t yet  &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; the battery by draining it to near zero, then fully charging, so that may improve.  I note the charging stand is rather small, so if necessary I&#x27;ll bring it along when I travel.</li>
    <li> I love it.  A full charge lets you use it daily for a month or longer.  When traveling you do not need to bring along the charger (which has a small footprint in itself). John/Joe Gindele. Minnesota</li>
    <li> Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes are the only toothbrushes I use. They really keep my teeth clean.  I upgraded to the platinum because I wanted the easy on-off button.</li>
    <li> The pros-the brush is powerful and really does a great job cleaning.  I was amazed to find that after using it, my dentist appointments improved, particularly with regard to healthier gums. The Con-it will spray all over the place, and yes, I actually wear a lobster bib to brush my teeth! Remember also that I am using the toothbrush on the highest settings, so if you prefer not to wear a lobster bib, just adjust the power down a notch or two and you will still benefit the precision of this toothbrush to hit your teeth in all the right places. JUST A SIDE NOTE-THE BRUSH HEADS SHOULD BE REPLACED EVERY 3-4 MONTHS AND THEY ARE NOT CHEAP.  I only use the inter care brush heads which are smaller and firmer than the other brush heads so they really offer a more deep clean. The other brush heads felt a bit too cumbersome, and not as precise in getting into smaller more problematic areas. http://www.amazon.ca/Philips-Sonicare-Intercare-Standard-Replacement/dp/B00E0CTVY0 Just an update 11 months later: still love the toothbrush and am finding the Intercare higher quality brush heads to be more readily available in Canada.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for over 7 years now. I started with the [[ASIN:B000AMRII0 Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush]]. I remember when I bought my first one, it took me awhile to get used to the power and my gums bled for a few weeks from using a standard toothbrush. Once your gums toughen up, for me it took a few weeks, you will only want to brush with a Sonicare. I remember at the time I though that was the best toothbrush ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forward a few years and I then bought the [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]. I seriously did not think brushing my teeth could get any better. The E series was nice but it was really bulky! It was hard to hold and when they came out with this one, I was so impressed! It felt great in my arthritic hands and the brush head is perfect! The buttons were perfectly located. After several years of using it, I have come to love it. I get compliments on my white teeth. If people knew how much coffee I drank, they would be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the newer one, the [[ASIN:B00CUG2582 Philips Sonicare HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], you are paying for more bells and whistles. It comes with 1 flexcare platinum handle, 2 standard intercare brush heads, 2 hygienic travel caps, 1 deluxe charger with cord wrap and brush head storage, and 1 travel case. I would never travel with a Sonicare but my father regularly takes them to Germany since they hold their charge so well. I must say the newer one, I am not as impressed. I prefer my previous one a lot more. The newer one is the exact same size and has more features, but I don&#x27;t think they needed to be improved. It has a rocker cradle on the front and I find myself pushing it in when I have a death grip on the toothbrush and it changes the settings. The rocker cradle is for low, medium, and high brush settings but if you are used to using a Sonicare like I am, the high setting is fine. Why do I have a death grip on the toothbrush? It is because it has a terrible backing to it! The previous one has a rubbery ridged back that is easy for my arthritic hand to hold and I have never had a problem with it. The newer on has a bright white back with no rubbery grips but only a few hard tiny circles. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have dropped the new one. When I am brushing my teeth and it vibrates, it is not only hard to hold on to but falls out of my hands. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have dropped the new one because of the back. Also with it being white and not a light aqua color like the other one it is more likely to get dirtier faster. I take really good care of my devices but after time and a death grip it is bound to get dirt on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also was not impressed with the brush heads. I like the other ones better too; they seem more contoured where the newer ones seem smaller. I was really hoping Sonicare was improving their product but have to say if you have not used one or are thinking of upgrading, you are not missing much. The [[ASIN:B00CUG2582 Philips Sonicare HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] has everything if not more and is a lot better in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it a few weeks, I am not that impressed and will keep using the other one I can hold onto better and know I am not accidentally changing the speeds which you can&#x27;t see since your hand is over it. I expected more from Sonicare but they did not deliver with this one.is fine. Why do I have a death grip on the toothbrush? It is because it has a terrible backing to it!

    <li> I have been using Philips Sonicare products for about four years now. Up until recently I was using the [[ASIN:B007ZN5ATQ Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White]], which is a basic unit with few settings and the worst replacement heads ever. So getting the chance to upgrade to the Philips Sonicare HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush was a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the advantages of the unit; The charging base is small so can be kept on most bathroom sinks without always getting in the way. Since it keeps a charge for a relatively long time you can also store the base. I&#x27;ve had mine for about four weeks and after the initial 24-hour charge it hasn&#x27;t needed to be recharged yet. It has a number of settings that you can choose from that best fits your brushing preference. One thing I also like it it has a pressure sensor alerting you if you are brushing too hard. The product comes with two \\&quot;InterCare\\&quot; heads which are adequate to start with. These brush heads are more standard and will fit multiple Socicare units, better than the replacement heads for the Essence 5600.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I have with the unit (and replacement brush heads as well) is that the cost is high, in my opinion much too high. I know the Essence 5600 is the cheap version but currently there is $140 difference between the two. As good as the Flexcare unit is, I question whether it&#x27;s worth it with so many other less expensive options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great unit that does exactly what it claims to do. I just wish it was a better value.</li>
    <li> NOW I see the justification of purchasing a ridiculously expensive toothbrush...Seriously. This Sonicare is clearly in a class of its own; top of the line. I have always used a manual brush and my husband also has a Sonicare, but a much lower end model. This one though is like the Ferrari of toothbrushes. There are three modes you can set it to and I actually like the one that is most intense. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth so if you do I would start out at a lower setting, just in case. Once it is charged, it keeps its charge for quite a while, which is always nice not having to worry about it working when you need it to. It is light-weight and attractive(not a selling point, but still). My teeth feel completely different using this than they ever did with a manual brush. Truly cleaner, like every crevice has been taken care of. I absolutely love this thing. What I don&#x27;t love is the cost of the replacement brushes, which are a necessity obviously. But I truly think this toothbrush is worth it. Now I just hope it lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> I have been a hard-core old fashioned manual tooth brushes user, until my dentist recommended (rather insisted) I use Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush. Doctor recommended this specific model because of the elongated shape of the brush heads- doctor said it&#x27;s better fitted to clean gums and around/under  the crowns.&lt;br /&gt;Product came well-packaged, everything as described etc.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it- giggled and was in a bit of a shock! Tickling vibrations were quite a new sensation to me! Took some getting used to, but nothing compares to the sense of cleanness and freshness  !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it- get it, totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Great price, quick shipping</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush that I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Phillips&#x27; Sonicare toothbrushes for several years, but this is is a new model.The brushes are a bit different and are advertised to remove more plaque than the old ones. I just had a dental checkup and it did seem as if it the hygienist didn&#x27;t need to take as long to clean my mouth as usual. The handle on this brush is a bit bigger than before; not quite as comfortable in my hand and a bit harder to turn quickly when the 30 second timer (a minuscule pause) alerts you to change to another part of your mouth. Also, it comes with a charger but not a sanitizer, so I&#x27;m using the sanitizer from my old unit (which lasted about 5 years, by the way - way past the warranty period and the expected life of the instrument). Phillips told me it was ok to do that. On the old brush, when one of the bristles changed from blue to white, it was time for a new brush head. I haven&#x27;t seen a reference to that with this new model - only instructions to change brush heads every 3 months for best performance. I would recommend this product, even though it&#x27;s quite expensive. And I&#x27;ve found that Phillips&#x27; customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> Had a very old model for many years. Decided to upgrade. The difference is amazing. Also love the air flosser!</li>
    <li> I have used this toothbrush for a few weeks now, and while I do like it and seems to work well.  The adjustable speeds are nice, I adjusted down for a few days when I wasn&#x27;t feeling that good and that was really convenient. The base is nice too with extra spots for the brush heads.  The base works charging my kids HX6311 version[[ASIN:B002CVTVUA Philips Sonicare HX6311/02 Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] so it cleared up some clutter on the vanity as well.  It just seems that at nearly 2 Ben Franklins it is a large expense for a toothbrush, even a nice one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t change settings that often and it seems just complicated enough that to make setting changes I had to have the manual near by, but for most things I had no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great toothbrush, but expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Sonicare toothbrushes for about 10+ years, and I&#x27;d rather not go back to regular toothbrushes, but these are becoming far too expensive to make much practical sense. If they made these with a replaceable battery, that would be one thing, but the planned obsolescence means these have a definite lifespan--when the battery dies, these are trash. I&#x27;d happily pay $200 for a Sonicare with a user-serviceable (and reasonably-priced) replaceable battery, but not for a toothbrush that will definitely become useless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used old school reciprocating electric toothbrushes, and I&#x27;ve used spinning brushes.  Both have something to offer, but neither ever wowed me.  Sonicare wows me.  Honestly I was a skeptic at first, but my teeth feel so great after using Sonicare tooth brushes.  This model is my 2nd that I&#x27;ve used, and both are amazing.  They are a bit pricey, and replacement heads do add a bit to the total cost, but they&#x27;re worth it.  Your teeth feel uber clean and smooth, the useful timing feature reminds you  every 30 seconds, so you can focus on each of four quadrants during a 2:00 brush.  It&#x27;s subtle, so you can devote your time however you like.  Ergonomics are solid, though not superb, but the weight and balance are spot on.  All in all, it&#x27;s very good.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have always used an electrical teeth brush and mainly the Oral B brand. However, my wife who purchased a similar Philips Sonicare product, advised me to buy this product since I suffer from periodontal disease. I was very skeptical in the beginning and thought that all brushes do the same, but how wrong was I?&lt;br /&gt;I bought the newer model a month ago and I am so happy with it. It cleans well and above all, it has the gum massage/cleaning option which I used at night and use the cleaning option in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product although it is very expensive in my opinion. The replacement brushes are also expensive and I wish there are coupons to use. Overall, if you hygiene freak as I am, invest the money in it and you will feel a big difference in your mouth.</li>
    <li> This is just what my dentist recommended and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Worked well and the best surprise was no surprise.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this toothbrush.  I had to replace my old Flexcare Plus when the battery finally died after 3 years.  In the few months that I was using a manual brush, I noticed my teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean (even if I tried to time the time that I was using the toothbrush).  In my last dentist visit, I learned that I was also starting to have more gum recession and sensitivity at certain times of the month. I&#x27;ve noticed less sensitivity after using the Flexcare Platinum, though that may also be because I&#x27;ve started wearing a mouthguard at night because of possible teeth grinding.  Regardless, my teeth feel clean again!    I find I started the brush at full power (3), and was fine, even when my teeth were at the most sensitive, when I first started using the brush.  If you aren&#x27;t used to an electronic toothbrush, you might want to start it at a lower setting.  However, if you are used to an electronic toothbrush, you will probably want to increase to a higher setting. I use the \\&quot;gum care\\&quot; mode at night and the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode in the morning when I have less time.  The upgrade on the Flexcare Platinum compared to the Flexcare Plus is that the brush will tell you if you are brushing too hard by vibrating at a different speed.  As someone with possible gum issues, I appreciate that feature.  I also am so excited that my teeth feel clean again.    One more thing - I kept my UV sanitizer and all the old accessories from the Flexcare Plus.  The Flexcare Platinum works fine with them, so there is no reason to buy any extras if you already have it.  I would have actually preferred to buy it without the hard case, since I still had my old one.</li>
    <li> Replaced an earlier version of a Sonicare that had a tendency to get gunk in the power head.  This one is easier to keep clean, and feels pretty durable.  I hope it lasts a few years.  Feels like it is cleaning my teeth at least as good as my old Sonicare.  The real test will be on my next check-up.</li>
    <li> I bought this Sonicare Platinum to replace an older version that I had for 10 years which finally died. Good high quality toothbrush that I expect from Philips Sonicare brand and the battery life of the Platinum is excellent, it lasted 3 weeks before having to recharge. My only disappointment about this purchase is that I thought the charging base came with the UV sanitizing feature, which it did not. Overall good purchase, but at this cost I would expect to get the sanitizing feature.</li>
    <li> I had some Amazon credit for something I had returned previous, otherwise I would not have purchased it.  The same product can be purchased at Costco with two units including 4 brushes and a water floss attachment for $124.</li>
    <li> very very good ,fully recommend</li>
    <li> Did you ever buy something you love so much you tell all your friends about it to the point of ridiculousness? That would be me and this toothbrush. I had a Sonic Healthy White which I liked pretty well but it was a little cumbersome and I felt was a little rough on my enamel. My dentist suggested I might want to try the Oral-B so I picked one up at Costco and the very next day took advantage of their generous return policy to get rid of it. Shoot, I could do a better job with a regular toothbrush and not have to listen to all that noise. After reading some good reviews on the Flexcare Platinum I decided to cough up the $$$ and try it. Worth every penny and then some. Why? Well first of all the sensitive setting is far more sensitive than the same setting on the Healthy White and my teeth feel just as squeaky clean. I find myself brushing my teeth several times a day just because it feels so good when they&#x27;re clean. Best of all, your custom settings stay put until you change them. That is not true on the less expensive models. You have to use the correct magic number of pushes on the button every single time and the button is also the power on button so it gets a little awkward. If you push the button before placing the brush in your mouth you splatter toothpaste all over your face so it&#x27;s best to turn it on after it&#x27;s in the mouth. I&#x27;ve tried several different Sonic brushes and by far prefer the soft ones. Hard bristles are NOT good for your teeth! This toothbrush isn&#x27;t going to change the world and it won&#x27;t even save your life but it just might save your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Seems less powerful than the original Sonicare yet nonetheless cleans well.  Travel case is a neat accessory.  Sanitizer a plus.</li>
    <li> Love Sonicare.  Wore through the first one we had.</li>
    <li> Since my left arm is not moving,  I love the Philips Sonicare . it &#x27;sure working for me.</li>
    <li> The brush head on this is much smaller than other Sonicares I&#x27;ve had in the past. I do not like the smaller brush. The timer part that beeps every 30 seconds to alert you when its time to move to the next quadrant, sounds exactly like the beep when you are brushing too hard. Kinda confusing. I&#x27;ve only had it a week so perhaps I&#x27;ll adjust after I&#x27;ve used it longer.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product - it does take a few days to get used to the power of an electric toothbrush but the performance and results of this product is definitely well worth the money. I do also enjoy that the device lets me know if I am pressing to hard with my teeth - which was needed the first few times brushing but after a while of using an electric tooth brush you really never have that problem.  Overall, great product and very satisfied. Carrying case with product is great for flights and travel!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Much better than my previous Sonicare.  Well worth extra cost. Much cleaner mouth including between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Much smaller, takes up less counter space and you hardly ever have to charge it so you don&#x27;t even need to leave the charger on your counter.</li>
    <li> Bought this toothbrush a 2 months ago after my last Philips finally broke after 2.5 years of use. This toothbrush was making a loud noise when using almost like the motor was burning out. This starting about two weeks ago. I tried to return it but it&#x27;s not eligible for returns. I would not recommend this model and am a bit disappointed that it can&#x27;t be returned after no longer working 2 months out.</li>
    <li> The best way I can review this wonderful toothbrush is to tell you that I suffered from Gingivitis for many years. I practice good oral health, but just couldn&#x27;t shake it. A few weeks after starting to use Sonicare, the Gingivitis left me and has not been back since. That&#x27;s all I need to tell you. I am now a lifelong customer of this brand.</li>
    <li> received yesterday. Used once - appears to be defective - you have to press and hold the brush head holder in order to work!! I have 5 year old sonicare and still works but the brush head holder is loose now that is why decided to purchase new sonicare.  Now thinking of going with oral-b 5000    returning it to amazon, called customer care of sonicare and was on hold for 35 mins and then I just hang up. No more sonicare for me I guess.    UPDATE: called them again and they sent me replacement which was  better than the first one. However, after 2 months it started sounding like plane flying next to your ear! Today I received another one from sonicare and it has the same problem right the out of the box. So this is my 3 rd replacement and I do not want anymore and will try to get my money back.    This does not deserve a single star at all!</li>
    <li> It may seem expensive, but it&#x27;s well worth the price.  Your teeth will feel a thousand times cleaner after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare brush leaves your teeth feeling smooth and your breath fresh.  The handle is the right size to hold and maneveur inside the mouth.  Fits nicely on the sink top.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist and received this when I was still in school. I used the oral B electric toothbrush before, and the difference is huge. My teeth felt a new kind of clean. You maily build up tartar on your lower front teeth on the tongue side and your upper back molars, and this helps totally minimize it. It blasts the plaque off without damaging your gums which is important. I would begin with the gums setting because you will bleed at the beginning, just like with flossing. Then when that is easier, go up to the highest setting because it will be the biggest help. If you&#x27;ve been told you have gingivitis or periodontitis, this is the best toothbrush you can get. If you&#x27;ve been told you have recession, this is the best toothbrush you can get. The pressure sensor will ensure you do not push too hard like SO many people do. All you need is a light grip and to guide your toothbrush along the gum line and tooth, the brush does all the work. The other nice thing about this brush is its a great adjunct to flossing. The brush pushes water/liquid through your teeth so it absolutely helps, so still floss but this also helps! Hope this is helpful. It&#x27;s well worth the money, I&#x27;ve had this brush for almost 2 years and am still obsessed with how it makes my teeth feel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this now for a few months and it works great.  Replace my other electric toothbrush that I could no longer find replacement heads for.  I really liked my old brush too because of the noticeable difference between a regular tooth brush and electric, but this brush is LEAGUES ahead of what I had before.  I think my teeth actually squeak with cleanliness!</li>
    <li> Battery died after 6 weeks.    I will probably at some point be able to get a replacement under warranty, but it took an hour to find the toll-free number to call (it&#x27;s 1-800-682-7664), and I chose a wrong time to call that number, and I know what this means; more and more hours trying to have a working ultrasonic toothbrush, when the current state of affairs is that I&#x27;m out six bills and have no working toothbrush.    Since what I wanted was a working toothbrush, not a non-working toothbrush and an obligation to fight repeatedly with customer service specialists on the phone for a few hours, I regret the purchase.  I will update this review with news on how the fight went, but it&#x27;d take an act of FedEx to make me change the star count.    The toothbrush is almost as good at cleaning my teeth as the 8 year old Sonicare Elite - still working, by the way - that it replaced; and it&#x27;s easier to keep clean owing to the sealed design.  If it actually worked it&#x27;d be somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.    EDIT:  Once I finally got through, during working hours, it took 32 minutes to get the guy on the other end to agree that the battery was defective.  To his credit he promptly shipped a replacement battery, which has been working fine for a month; they made me ship the old one back, on my own dime, which is against the law where I live, but whatever.  Add a Hamilton to whatever you thought this thing cost.    It works fine.  I usually spend about half as long as the device thinks I should, twice a day; and I floss once a day.  The compact DiamondClean bristle tip I chose works very well, cleans everything, even the little spaces between the gum and tooth junction; when I had to go on a trip for a few days and bring a normal toothbrush because this one was out of commission, I missed having clean teeth.    I still have all the teeth I was born with, intact; and I plan on maintaining that state of affairs for another 40 years.  This device makes it much easier to carry out my plan.</li>
    <li> best electric toothbrush on the market......bar none</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome. I replaced an original model Sonicare that I&#x27;ve had for more than 10 years because the battery was finally not holding a charge for more than a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a tremendous improvement. My teeth feel much cleaner (and remember, this is much cleaner than an original model Sonicare, I&#x27;m not even upgrading from a regular brush or other electric), the charging is more convenient, the options are better, the different brush heads are nice. Everything. I&#x27;m thrilled with this brush and very very enthusiastically recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just have to see in about 2 months if my dentist notices any improvement either.</li>
    <li> Amazing cleaning power compared to my Sonicare purchased in 2004</li>
    <li> Love this Sonicare unit. My dentist said I would. Always feels like you just got cleaned by a pro.</li>
    <li> When I was at the dentist last time, I mentioned that I wish I could have a polisher of my own at home.  That&#x27;s when the topic of electric toothbrushes came up.  I never had one before.  She suggested either Sonicare or Oral B.  I read the reviews and each seemed to have their own fan group for different reasons.  I chose Sonicare since it has a smaller toothbrush head and I am very pleased.  After using it, my teeth feel smooth, just like after a dentist visit, and it&#x27;s been able to remove some of the staining on my front teeth.  I wish I had learned about it 10 years ago.  Hopefully it&#x27;s improving my gum health too.  I&#x27;m curious to know if my dentist will notice an improvement at my next visit.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s dentist recommended this particular toothbrush, so I purchased this as a gift for my daughter! And she loves it!</li>
    <li> The dentist recommended this toothbrush for my husband who was at risk for gingivitis. It does a really nice job of cleaning hard to reach &amp; problem areas like behind the bottom teeth and back teeth. The charge lasts a while, so one can travel with it without the charger. It has 3 modes, though they are a little gimmicky. This toothbrush will give you a very close &amp;#34;just from the dentist&amp;#34; clean and will replace most manual toothbrushes, unless you keep one on hand for tongue cleaning. I think these are worth the money and do an excellent job of keeping the mouth healthy.​</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. I would never have gotten one if not for my wife needing this for a gum disease she is fighting. Eventually I started using it also and I have never had a better teeth cleaning experience short of the dentist office. I literally feel like I have left the dentist every day and night. I am sure my hygienist will be very surprised at how my teeth look next visit. Bottom line is this system is extremely effective. I love the gum health setting. I would buy it again and once you go the Sonicare way you will never go back to just a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a few months now and my mouth feels cleaner than brushing with a normal brush.  The battery lasts a long time so dont worry about traveling with it.  It may be expensive but delivers on quality and performance.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush last week and received the item promptly. So far so good. I&#x27;ll report at my next dentist appointment! I like that it&#x27;s easy on your gums and doesn&#x27;t rattle your entire head, and it&#x27;s relatively quiet for an electric toothbrush. The build is sturdy. It&#x27;s somewhat attractive for an electric toothbrush...no garish colors and it&#x27;s looks high tech a la Apple. I very much appreciate that you can adjust the intensity. This was a must for me as I need the low intensity setting. Thus far, I like this toothbrush a lot and it&#x27;s definitely much easier than manual brushing. I really enjoy brushing my teeth now and find that I&#x27;m brushing much longer as well. Ive been using it for 2 cycles instead of just one, to make sure I do a good job and because I&#x27;m just enjoying the efficiency. I feel like a master of dental hygiene, and I&#x27;m imagining how my normally somewhat morose dentist is going to be so pleased :)  UPDATE: Nov. 25, 2014 It&#x27;s been 2.5 months since my last review. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH! My teeth are so clean. The only thing I would change is to either make the quads in the timer longer because I feel it doesn&#x27;t give you sufficient time, and to follow that up with two extra timed sections to do the fronts and backs of your front teeth only, and I wish it didn&#x27;t turn off automatically after it&#x27;s done, but continued so you could do what you want to finish up. I find that I (need...or want?) to brush longer than just the 2 minutes allotted. When brushing, I use the clean setting...the whitening setting does a weird little jittery &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; every so often, and the gum care is nice as long as you don&#x27;t want to brush over two minutes. It works by going through the regular brush routine, and at the end of 2 minutes, does the gum setting which is like a massage. I used to hate...dread...and was thoroughly annoyed with having to brush my teeth every day. The Sonicare has completely changed my feelings on this and I now enjoy brushing my teeth. The Sonicare feels good on your gums, like a massage, and is almost relaxing in a weird way. A+ for this toothbrush- thank you for changing how I feel about the dental hygiene routine!  UPDATE: May 25, 2015 It&#x27;s been 9 months since my purchase and this is still the best toothbrush EVER. My teeth are cleaner and whiter than they were using a conventional toothbrush. I also love the travel case. I brush on the standard &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting and don&#x27;t see much use to the white and gumcare settings. A sonicare with only the basic function will suit most people. I purchased this particular sonicare because the intensity could be adjusted and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be able to handle the full intensity as far as sensitivity. If you&#x27;re not concerned about that, you may be able to find a &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; clean setting only Sonicare for a cheaper price, and just put the Flexcare heads on it that you can find online or in retail stores.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush on a recommendation from a friend and was hesitant to purchase because I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes in the past that didn&#x27;t seem to do much more than brush my teeth. After the first time brushing with this toothbrush, my teeth felt as clean and smooth as they do after leaving the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;After using for several weeks, I think that the health of my mouth has improved and my teeth look slightly whiter (I have always used whitening toothpaste, but didn&#x27;t think it was doing much). I have also noticed a huge decrease in pain/sensitivity in some of my teeth that used to get bothered after eating foors like popcorn or chips. I think this is because the toothbrush gets ALL the food debris out (even in tiny spaces where flossing didn&#x27;t even seem to help).</li>
    <li> Good battery life and excellent indicator for brushing to hard great feature like all the accessories and hope it lasts for years.</li>
    <li> Very poor reliability! That would sum this brush up nicely. I&#x27;ve had several Philips Sonicare brushes over the years and they all do not last any reasonable length of time. Each and every successive model breaks down. And they all break down after 3-4 months at the mount when I turn on the brush and the motor starts but does not transmit the sonic movement to the brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it could be the way I brush my teeth. I could be using too much pressure which in turn damage the mounts over time but this should NOT be a factor when manufacturing a reliable product. Philips should make a brush which can withstand a wide range of brushing style and still be reliable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I keep coming back to Philips? Well, the sonicare series do result in a very clean set of teeth everytime you use them. I like them a lot and did think they were once the best out there. But at the high price and poor reliability, I have decided to go back to Braun. Slightly slower, perhaps subjectively a little less clean, but much more reliable and those work horses will last you years to come.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush and HUGE upgrade from my prior E-series.  The Flex capabilities are nice because I&#x27;ll do the Clean mode every morning and then alternate between White and Gum Care for my nightly brush.  The price is definitely an investment compared to the more entry level models, but I&#x27;ve found it to be a worthy investment in the first month after using the E-series for several years.</li>
    <li> This if my first electronic toothbrush. It turned out really good! Highly recommended it!</li>
    <li> DiD not get this off Amazon, I have Had this for 2+ years, I am a VERY picky shopper and I love it still!</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d spend this much money on a toothbrush.  In fact, I still can&#x27;t believe I spent this much money on one. However, it does clean my teeth and mouth better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The first week I had it I kind of marveled at how clean my teeth felt.  Now a few months later I&#x27;m either used to it or spoiled by it and couldn&#x27;t go back to a regular toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t know how it compares to less expensive models since I&#x27;ve never tried them but I have no regrets spending the extra money on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see my dentist the day before this arrived and told her I&#x27;d ordered one online in a moment of crazy.  She was thrilled and told me she&#x27;d be seeing a lot less of me in the future.  After a few months using this I totally believe her.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush to me, and I&#x27;m very glad I listened to her.  I&#x27;ve had the brush for a month now, and I can honestly say my teeth feel much like they do after I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush offers a cleaning like no other. I am extremely happy with my purchase and my husband loves it too! It is very gentle and the 30 second interval reminders are great! I mostly use the gum massage mode but they&#x27;re all great! This is a steal on amazon, anywhere else they&#x27;re super expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd sonicare I have purchased. The 1st on lasted 4 years and then stopped working, not great, but my wife&#x27;s has been around for 6+ years without issue.&lt;br /&gt;They may be expensive, but the build quality is better than any other electronic toothbrush on the marker.&lt;br /&gt;The new design of this toothbrush is nice and very clean looking. They have multiple speed and intensity settings. I also like how the toothbrush will let you know when you are brushing too hard by changing the vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a nice carrying case and the charger also separate so it is easier to travel with. You can also use the new &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; brushes with this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely the only brush to get if you want to go electric.</li>
    <li> fast ship good product does what the advertising says</li>
    <li> Great value and cleans very well.  Can&#x27;t stand one has to press on button 3 times or hold down for long to shut off. Stupid feature whoever thought of that idea</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. It worked only for one year and then stopped working. Too many functionalities that you don&#x27;t really need and don&#x27;t make any difference in terms of cleaning. The brush stopped rotating and charging. I would go for older versions with less functionality to have a longer life span.</li>
    <li> This new style Phillips Sonicare is so much easier to use than my older model. It has many new features which I will have to try - one at a time. But for now, I am enjoying this much needed - newer model.&lt;br /&gt;Another feature is a very nice packing unit for traveling. I can&#x27;t wait to try that.&lt;br /&gt;This was a Christmas present from my husband (of course I told him I would like to have it).</li>
    <li> It is for a christmas gift so I can not comment but my dentist sells a different model of the sonicare so I assume it will be good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned four previous Sonicare toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve used them for 20-yrs and credit the toothbrushes with saving me from gingivitis. When it came time to replace my older tooth brush, the Flexcare+, I decided to splurge. Mistake. This toothbrush is bulkier than my old model, and a good $30 more expensive. And for what? Brushing Perfomance that doesn&#x27;t feel better, more weight, bulkier design and no UV charger. (It&#x27;s ok, since I have the old UV Charger.) Additionally, the brush has a &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; which prevents you from brushing too hard, which cycles the vibrations down and adds a pulsing frequency to let you know it does not like your technique. The problem is if you brush briskly, it activates the pulse. Sonicares do a stellar job cleaning. My hygienist always says there&#x27;s nothing for her to do because of my brushing and and flossing. So would I buy this again? No. I would buy the Sonicare Flexcare+.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Sonicare Toothbrushes since I first tried them a few years ago.  The reason I liked them right away was that, unlike other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;d tried, this brand left my teeth feeling really clean and after a week of using it, my teeth looked whiter.  The other thing that impressed me right away is that the Sonicare has never made my gums bleed which they always did with other toothbrushes and even when brushing by hand.  I have no idea why that would be, since brushing my teeth by hand seems to me to be a lot less intense.  But that really sold me on the Sonicare and I&#x27;ve been using one or another Sonicare model ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have lots of different models and I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], the [[ASIN:B0085RZLU4 Philips Sonicare HX6972/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], and the [[ASIN:B0085RZLUE Philips Sonicare HX6911/30 Flexcare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].  (It isn&#x27;t because they didn&#x27;t last, but because I&#x27;ve had a chance to try them through the Vine program.) This one is my favorite so far because it has 9 total brushing speeds (which they call \\&quot;experiences\\&quot;):  3 cleaning modes (Clean, White, Gum Care) and 3 intensity settings (Low, Medium, High). The settings are easily changed with a combination of buttons on the front. This allows me to use the gentler speeds on sensitive areas of my mouth and the more intense on my front teeth which I&#x27;m always trying to get whiter.  In reality, all these different speeds and modes are kind of a gimmick because you&#x27;ll probably find one or two that you like and those are the ones you&#x27;ll always use.  It also has a 30 second buzzer/vibration feature which lets you know to move to another area of your mouth in case you&#x27;re zoned out early in the morning or daydreaming and forget you&#x27;ve had the brush in one area for over 30 seconds.  I really like this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I really like about this toothbrush is that it has a small footprint on my bathroom counter.  It&#x27;s pretty compact and I don&#x27;t have to keep it plugged in all the time because one overnight charge lasts for weeks. It comes with a plastic carrying case too, which is also convenient.  Once I became accustomed to a Sonicare I was never content to travel with a manual toothbrush. This toothbrush is not only effortless to use, but it gets my teeth really clean.that I really like about this toothbrush is that it has a small footprint on my bathroom counter.

    <li> My wife and I are really liking this toothbrush. We are prior users of the [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush And Refill Brush Head 1 Count]] and have found the Sonicare to be superior in most categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the Sonicare is considerably queiter, with a soft hum even at high setting, versus the Oral-Bs consistent loud hum. The charge on the Sonicare is good for 1-2 weeks with two users, while the Oral-B lasts roughly 3-4 days (long enough for a weekend trip, but not for a week long vacation). My wife and I tend to use the clean setting only, but the option of tailoring the brushing to sensitivity with the High, Medium and Low setting has been a useful feature. The cleaning action tends to be more of a vibration versus the Oral-Bs scrubbing. Cost wise, the Sonicare is a bit more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we have no complaints about the cleaning action on our teeth, both feeling that our teeth come away feeling smoother and our gums less irritated than with the Oral-B (which is not to say the Oral-B traumatizes our teeth or gums, it is just a subjective comparison). P-)</li>
    <li> My previous electric toothbrush was the older Sonicare Essence model and what a difference this Flexcare makes!&lt;br /&gt;First, the design is more ergonomic and I love the smaller diameter of this new toothbrush handle. The Flexcare provides much more efficient cleaning than the previous model. I base that on the fact that my nightly cleaning regimen is comprised of several steps and after using the Flexcare as the first step in my regimen, there is less work required on the rest of my routine.&lt;br /&gt;I traveled out of the country with my new Flexcare and loved the fact that the charger is dual voltage. The charger is also much smaller and convenient than its predecessor. I charged the Flexcare fully before leaving home and was able to use it for almost two weeks before the battery charge indicator went down  to &amp;#34;one LED&amp;#34; status.  This means  I can travel for longer trips without bringing the charger along.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I could ask for to make this perfect would be the ability to replace the batteries when they eventually no longer hold their charge.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush on the market.</li>
    <li> Hi Everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Philips Sonicare for about 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i always have to replace the Sonicare about every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit gets loud, then just Stops, My wife laughed at me, because the unit got loud, but i told her from previous purchases, i still had at least one week left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Suggestion is to Certainly Purchase the Philips Sonicare, just don&#x27;t bother buying the replacement toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in 12 months, you just replace the entire Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the best cleaning, and adds smoothness to your teeth, For Sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shopped with Amazon for at least 6 years, and have always told the truth in my reviews.</li>
    <li> I have used a variety of electric toothbrushes over the years from various companies, but this is definitely the best one yet.  The price is a bit scary, but if it saves you from getting a single cavity (and the resulting dental bill), then you have probably recouped your investment.  My teeth feels clean and smooth, like I&#x27;ve just had a professional cleaning at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush comes with two brush heads, a charging base, a hard plastic travel case, and an user&#x27;s manual.  The charge on the brush lasts about 3 weeks, assuming that it is used twice a day for a two minute cycle.  For the initial charge, it is recommend that you charge it for a minimum of 24 hours.  Subsequent charges are accomplished overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush features the Quad timer.  Every 30 seconds, the toothbrush gives a slight buzz.  This is your signal to move to another quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment with this toothbrush (and electric toothbrushes in general) is that the rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t replaceable.  In order to extend the life of the battery, I do not store it on the charging base on a daily basis.  I only charge it when needed, which is about every 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Moved up from Elite series and my teeth are noticeably whiter in a week.  Nothing more to say on this.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush.  I am generally pleased, however this brush is quite noisy.  I find that factor to be quite annoying.</li>
    <li> My son received this as a Christmas gift,he was pleased.</li>
    <li> I ended up trading in my Sonicare Essentials for something more gum-health orientated. I don&#x27;t have sensitive gums, but i do have a bad habit of brushing too hard around the gum line, so i&#x27;m giving this a try and see if this does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s plastic, this does have a more quality feel than the Essentials. The essentials gets gunk buildup in it&#x27;s nooks and crannies, whereas this model doesn&#x27;t seem to get any residue. Also, interchangable heads are faster to change out, and a variety of settings and speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to say if this is helping my gumline, so i&#x27;ll have to wait and see what my dentist says.</li>
    <li> I previously was using a 6+ y.o. Sonicare and really liked it. It was losing horsepower due to weak battery so I upgraded to the Flexcare. I am impressed by the power. If you are not used to it, it could be a little too much. You have the option of mellowing it out by setting a combination of the two buttons on the handle. These buttons, however, can be inadvertently pushed during normal use and require you to turn off the brush to reset or you will have toothpaste smatterings all over the mirror. I ordered one for the wife and one for myself because we travel frequently and cannot use the same handle. The first one came with all of the required pieces. The second was missing one of the advertised two brushes. The company said they would refund $10 or send another brush. I took the latter option as it is worth more for the brush head. The second box was clearly marked &amp;#34;for professional use only, not for resale&amp;#34;. WTF? Illegal to be resold, maybe? Would recommend and buy again. No problems otherwise.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Sonicare a little over a year ago.  I had another Sonicare that simply wore out after 8 years of use.  I chose this one because my dental hygienist always said that I was not brushing between my teeth well enough.  Now, after 2 appointments with her, that problem is solved.  This brush is far superior to any that I have used before.  The combinations of brushing styles and intensity of brushing are convenient, although I tend to use the some one all the time.  I cannot comment on how long the battery will last because I have only owned it for only 1 year.  However, I can say that I get about 35 brushes between charges, using a 2 1/2 minute program at the highest intensity.  I enjoy not having the hygienist pick at my teeth any more.</li>
    <li> works like a dream. I&#x27;m 24 and this is my first electric toothbrush and I absolutely love it. I definitely recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Works great, I have been using for several weeks and I am very impressed with the performance and battery life. I would have given 5 stars but I feel the replacement brushes are over priced for what they are.</li>
    <li> works great.  brushes are tight to put on handle.  also, no easy way to keep brushes right on the counter.  but overall a great product</li>
    <li> My dentist hounded me for quite a while to acquire an electirc toothbrush. Being a slow adopter, I fianlly chose this one.and it has been great. Not cheap but it made a defintie difference in the way my mouth felt within a week or two.</li>
    <li> Very good product. My husband and I have been using it for more than 3 years now. Best product out there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  My teeth feel clean all the time and although I have very sensitive gums, I have not had any issues.  I love it this toothbrush. I love the sensor that indicates if I brush too hard, which my dentist has indicated before that I do (damaging the enamel).  It also has the timer that suggest how long I should brush my teeth.  Keeps me in check :)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve lived this long without it.</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonicare I have had over the years. As those in the past it works well for me my wife and me. One disappointment I had with this one is that the two heads included with the unit were identical. In the past there were different color rings so my wife and I could differentiate our individual heads. I don&#x27;t understand why Philips discontinued this useful feature.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is just amazing. You can feel the difference immediately after the first use. It is a lot cheaper at Costco though. They have a set of TWO toothbrushes for like 139.99 now and they lowered the price so i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s cheaper now. If you know someone who wants one you can go halves with them, so you&#x27;d pay about $70-75 and save some money. I REALLY recommend this brush. It does wonders!!</li>
    <li> My oral health began to feel improved after just two uses. My only gripe is the battery strength but hey, nothing is perfect. Thank you Phillips</li>
    <li> To be responsible, I write this review after I used it for 2 weeks. This is my second electric toothbrush from Phillips Sonicare. I feel this one is much better than the old one and has more functions.&lt;br /&gt;  These 2 weeks I used the white mode and medium intensity level.My teeth turns out to be from little light color to white. But don&#x27;t worry, the surface of my teeth still has its own protective layer, which means it not only cleaned but also protected my teeth while making teeth bright! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;  As for the battery, I only charged it once until now(2 weeks), the battery only lowers to the second light.Battery lasts very long !!!</li>
    <li> This was a requested gift.  Recipient has told me it works great and meets her special dental needs.  All happy</li>
    <li> A bit disappointed. Still need to floss after using it.</li>
    <li> Very effective toothbrush. I love the way that it cleans. Be certain to go through the &amp;#34;ramp-up&amp;#34; feature if this is your first electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! My teeth definitely feel cleaner than when I used the oral b toothbrush.</li>
    <li> So this is a lot of money for a toothbrush. How much are  your real teeth worth to you? If your dentist has mentioned this as a problem for you, this is the right toothbrush. It delivers on its promises. I only wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected from Sonicare. It is kind of weird the way it vibrates. I have had better from Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth with anything else. I&#x27;ve been buying Philips Sonicare for the last 5+ years and this is my third one. I&#x27;ve literally had better dentist checkups since I&#x27;ve been using these. Make sure you figure out the proper way to brush your teeth with this, though. I just went to the dentist the other day and all this time I&#x27;ve been using this like a regular toothbrush. Turns out I was brushing away my gums and those don&#x27;t grow back. This is called &amp;#34;recession&amp;#34;, apparently. Educate yourself on how to brush your teeth with an electric toothbrush! Ask your dentist or watch a Philips Sonicare instructional video. They are out there for your viewing and educational pleasure!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed. It has an &amp;#34;Intensity Level&amp;#34; rocker switch in the middle of the handle -- right where you grip the unit during use. Because the rocker switch requires so little force to change the setting, the intensity level is frequently being changed accidentally while in use. Additionally, the most vigorous intensity level creates so much vibration and noise that I fear the unit will have a very short life-span. I&#x27;ve used Sonicares for over 20 years and always have been pleased with them. But this model suffers from a very poor design. I wish I had never purchased it!  This is a follow-up to my original review. In my original review (above), I mentioned that the intensity level seemed excessive to me. I predicted its early demise. My prediction was correct. When it was approximately 6 months old, the pre-programmed vibration pauses (which let the user know when to move on to another quadrant of teeth) became very erratic. The time intervals were no longer consistent. After going through the four-quadrant cycle at low vibration intensity, it then went through another cycle at full vibration intensity.  I called Sonicare about the problem. And I must say that they immediately sent me out a replacement.</li>
    <li> I love how it&#x27;s just one toothbursh and a base. Oral-b&#x27;s electronic tooth brush has a whole separate monitor for it. Takes up to much space. I love the 3 functions but usually use the gentle brush fucntion. Teeth feel so clean!</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase: I bought it on a recommendation from my dental hygienist...it&#x27;s made it a lot more fun to brush my teeth and they seem to get a lot cleaner. I found a 6 pack of DiamondCleab brush heads at Costco for something like $29 with a $10 off coupon.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! By far better than I expected!!!! My teeth felt polished clean from the first time I used it! I will not be going back to regular tooth brushes... Ever! Sonicare for life!</li>
    <li> Terrific!  this is my second one and it&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> Been using this for several weeks, so far and I like it. This model has a flat on/off switch which works better with wet fingers.  Had a previous model with a light blue-green rubber dome type on/off switch that I did not care for as the dome switch was often slippery to use and harder to press.  The flat on/off switch was a desirable feature on this model for me.  This model seems slightly lighter than the previous model. The variable sensitivity options are not important to me, I have not used them and unable to comment on them. The default setting works just fine out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two brush heads come with it, and they are labeled differently. The instructions seem to indicate that the two brushes are identical. I don&#x27;t have a clue what the deal is with the two brush names, that confused me, then I forgot about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one problem with the device.  The nice flat on/off switch seems easier to toggle on/off than the rubber dome switch which has led to unintentional power-downs during use.  I had to re-learn how to hold the brush body so I did not accidentally turn it off.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. Replaced my old sonicare and what a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It was money well spent.</li>
    <li> Perfect ! great control features</li>
    <li> When I first used it the Sonic vibration was compared to an active dentist&#x27;s tool. Now after using it for several days, I have become use to it, and see the results as an excellent method to brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> So I love brushing my teeth with the sonicare. It cleans my teeth so much better than manual brushing that I will never go back and I doubt that any other electric toothbrush cleans as well, but I have not tried them all. I have run into a few problems, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the replacement heads being super expensive, and presumably of high quality, I have gotten more than one to begin to buzz very loudly while using it for only a week or so, and continue to do that for the remainder of their life. This would indicate something loose inside the head. It does not happen to all of them, hence, the heads are of lower quality than they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems: This design of the toothbrush (compared to e series) makes it nearly impossible to keep clean at the junction between the brush head and the handle at all times. When using the brush in the morning, sometimes, it sprays and aerosolizes this downright nauseatingly foul gunk all over my face, nose, and shirt. It happens in a split second and it is so gross it makes me gag. The solution is to try to be vigilant in keeping it clean, which I do. Alas, this still happens more regularly than it should. It&#x27;s enough to make me stop using the toothbrush and switch back to manual for the day, or longer while I curse about how gross it smells, then clean it thoroughly and forgive it. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> Super toothbrush.  And my dentist loves it too.</li>
    <li> Works very well, no issues.</li>
    <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.  I had a filing on a certain tooth because I brush to hard.  But now with this brush I&#x27;m alerted when I&#x27;m brushing to hard.  I&#x27;ve figured out that at a certain angle, where my cheek is closest/tightest against my teeth, and with my right hand,...I tend to brush very hard.  The cleaning is also superb.  Best purchase I made for myself .</li>
    <li> Much to my amazement and disappointment, after 13 months of use, toothbrush ceased to function properly. Started OK, but after 10-15 seconds, brush barely moves--regardless of setting, etc.  No idea why.  Weak battery? Dead battery? No longer rechargeable?  Doesn&#x27;t really matter.  Great while it lasted, but 13 months? Previous Philips Sonicare worked for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so upset, I originally bought the flexcare platinum with uv sanitizer and Loved it!!!  Then I forgot it at a hotel during vacation and had to rebuy my toothbrush. I went with this lower grade model thinking it&#x27;d be the same but didn&#x27;t need the uv sanitizer. It&#x27;s a sad replacement, It&#x27;s loud and all of a sudden stopped working!!!  Worst part, I looked to find out about returning it and for some reason can&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m so upset.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a replacement for my Sonicare HX6972/10, which began having issues after two years.  I decided to stick with Sonicare as it was a fantastic toothbrush when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer model is somewhat of a disappointment from the previous model - it is lighter and cheaper feeling and the ergonomics decidedly different.  Overall I am happy with the newer model, but am wary that it will not last due to its flimsy construction.</li>
