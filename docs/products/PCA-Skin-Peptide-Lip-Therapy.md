<li> Haven&#x27;t use it long enough to notice a decrease in lip lines but hoping it will help early stages of feathering!</li>
<li> but I also use it as needed throughout the day since my lips are exceedingly dry because I smoke.</li>

<li> This product has a weird minty aftertaste, and I will likely re-order from different merchant</li>
<li> I do notice my lips are a little fuller</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Similar to a much less expensive Sally Hansen lip peptide product.  </li>
<li> THICK AND WAXY WITH A SLIGHT MINT TASTE...</li>
<li> This was a last resort before I underwent expensive treatment from my dermatologist.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it feels thick and gummy on my lips with a rather unpleasant minty taste.</li>
<li> so I can get the product I am used to, and doesn&#x27;t seem like it is old or something else terribly tastefully AWEFULL.</li>
<li> Customer service is horrible the vendor never responded to any of my request for  a refund</li>

    <li> Love this product and glad to find it offered on Amazon.  This  is great for the winter months that are so harsh on lips.</li>
    <li> PURCHASE MADE BASED ON  RECOMMENDATION IN RECENT ISSUE OF PREVENTION MAGAZINE...THICK AND WAXY WITH A SLIGHT MINT TASTE...NO OTHER SIGNS OF POSITIVE EFFECTS..GOING BACK TO BURTS BEES AND CHAPSTICK..LOT CHEAPER...</li>
    <li> Similar to a much less expensive Sally Hansen lip peptide product.  I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s the only chapped lip relief that I&#x27;ve found that really works.  Love it. Recommend it - arrived as promised.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have used lots of different lip moisturizers but was still left with flaky lips.  This product feels good going on and WORKS! Now my lipsticks go on more smoothly and just look better.  THANKS!</li>
    <li> Love this brand and lip product.</li>
    <li> I am a return customer - thanks for the consistent product and delivery results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It keeps your lips moist for hours even under lipstick! When ever I run out I waste my money on something else and always go back to this. When I put this on at night my lips are nice and moist the next morning without being greasey. My only complaint is that I wish it came in a larger size. This beats chapstick any day. I do notice my lips are a little fuller but I think that is because they are so well moisturized.</li>
    <li> Overall, I think this is a fairly good product as it really does seem to plump up my lips and keep them soft. My only complaint is that it feels thick and gummy on my lips with a rather unpleasant minty taste. I only use it at night. Will not repurchase because of texture and taste.</li>
    <li> This product has a wonderful tingly feeling and is very moisturizing to the lips.  I really like it.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Researched what would be the best lip treatment for my chronic chapped lips and this popped up!  Thought I&#x27;d try it and am I ever thankful I did!  I am sold and will never try anything else!  Been using it a week now and my lips are smoother and stay hydrated.  Feels great when you apply it and has a pleasant taste.  Haven&#x27;t use it long enough to notice a decrease in lip lines but hoping it will help early stages of feathering!</li>
    <li> I buy this product on a regular basis for myself. Years ago, my lips cracked and the skin was peeling off of them. My dermatologist sold me this product and I&#x27;ve been hooked since then! You&#x27;re supposed to use it 2ce a day - in the morning and at night - but I also use it as needed throughout the day since my lips are exceedingly dry because I smoke. Also, at night, I use it on the lines above my lips and it softens them. With this product, my lips are smooth and moist. I heartily recommend this product to anyone with dry lips.</li>
    <li> This was a last resort before I underwent expensive treatment from my dermatologist. When used as directed, this product works surprisingly well! I noticed a slight difference in 2 weeks. My lips are dry, flaky, and sun damaged. I noticed that this product has helped hydrate and smooth my lips. I will keep using this. Thank you PCA Skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year and a half and I love how it feels, looks, and smells!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money, you might as well get chapstick, much cheaper and better product. Customer service is horrible the vendor never responded to any of my request for  a refund and I tried 3 times.  No response is all you need to know. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> No. This product has a weird minty aftertaste, and I will likely re-order from different merchant so I can get the product I am used to, and doesn&#x27;t seem like it is old or something else terribly tastefully AWEFULL.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is yummy!!! Love the feeling, zingy,  smell and my lip lines look smoother ... Im in for this product</li>
    <li> My friend recommended to use not only on my lips but on the lines surrounding my mouth as well. It is somewhat thick, but if you massage it in it&#x27;s fine. It has reduced the lines and the scent is wonderful. I am very please with this product.</li>
    <li> As you age your lips fade.  This really brings back the color and gives them a fuller appearance.</li>
