      <li>Happy to have one of my favorite fragrances once again!</li>
      <li>it smells good when you spray</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, deeper notes as the fragrance wears than I would expect from the lighter notes in the beginning.  </li>
      <li>He loved it.  </li>
      <li>RIGHT HERE!!!!</li>
      <li>This scent is great for most men.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice and the person loved the gift.</li>
      <li>Love this scent on my boyfriend!</li>
      <li>Again, not a bad scent but not my ideal type.</li>
      <li>so I purchased this for my man and was very pleased with the amazing scent.</li>
      <li>He didn&#x27;t expect to like it, but when he sprayed it on, we both liked it, not too strong and a very nice manly scent.</li>
      <li>If you can even fish out how to contact them ,then you have to imput your own phone num,ber and</li>
      <li>However it still has its own character</li>
      <li>Nice scent for a night in the house, lounging,</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews I decided to get this for him, since the others were so nice smelling on him.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re like me and looking for a Curve with a nice spice and masculinity to make women from all corners of the earth float to you</li>
      <li>and we really liked its smell.</li>
      <li>I am very happy that I did, because I was able to buy this 3.4oz  bottle at a very cheap price, and it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>Great product and unique style of a bottle.</li>
      <li>is a very pleasant fragrance that reminds me of the original Dior Fahrenheit, opening with a blend of aquatic, herbal, and \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; notes then settling into a musky fragrance that is easy on the nose.  </li>
      <li>Kind of exotic, like a holiday in the Orient.</li>
      <li>This is another one of my favorites and is good to wear for any season except the summer because it is somewhat sweet.  </li>
      <li>I received a great bargain when I purchased this NEW cologne that I have never had the opportunity to smell its scent, but based on the description, I liked what I read and decided to try.</li>
      <li>Love this cologne.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my son&#x27;s favorite parfume and I purchased it because of his birthday.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Curve for men was once my favorite cologne to smell on a man, but I have since changed my #1 from that to Curve Soul for men.</li>
      <li>tally for Soul is 4.3 stars out of five - if the longevity were greater, it would probably be close to my Top 10 list.  </li>
      <li>and I love it...</li>
      <li>This is best CURVE outside of CURVE!</li>
      <li>I like Soul much better.</li>
      <li>Curve is much more synthetic.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love this cologne and it does not sell in the stores.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tally for Soul is 4.3 stars out of five - if the longevity were greater, it would probably be close to my Top 10 list.  </li>
      <li>but I would&#x27;ve paid more regardless.</li>
      <li>I do, however, really love Curve Wave.</li>
      <li>I love the Curve line of men&#x27;s colognes and I think that &#x27;Soul&#x27; is my favorite.</li>
      <li>After buying Mambo cologne I&#x27;ve learn to fall in love with the Liz Claiborne products.  </li>
      <li>My wife had purchased the women&#x27;s curve vintage soul many times before</li>
      <li>I love the smell, but it lacks hang time.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it</li>
      <li>but I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and the original Curve scent.</li>
      <li>At first I loved it - it&#x27;s a combination of spices</li>
      <li>light and refreshing, many compliments when i wear it.</li>
      <li>Soul also offers great flexibility/versatility to be worn during any season, time of day, or any event - I think it will work well for any occasion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wish it were more available in my area.</li>
      <li>Besides I use it at work so don&#x27;t want it to be too strong - workplace rules.     </li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to cologne&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s been a struggle to find a good one for my husband that I can tolerate, and that we both like.</li>
      <li>Has a smooth, pleasing scent that isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
      <li>First time i used it it smelled pretty good (</li>
      <li>I came across a young gentleman who smelled so good</li>
      <li>Now I guess that&#x27;s a good thing if you like a sweet and light basic cologne smell, but I like a bit more masculinity to my colognes.</li>
      <li>Its my new favorite smell on him :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a warm wood gentleness to it and not SO strong that it hits you but strong enough to gently remind you of its warm presence.</li>
      <li>and I will be testing the effects of the scent (unknowingly, lol) on the women I am around to see if it&#x27;s worthy enough to wear.</li>
      <li>Soul is by Curve, and you can smell the similarity to the original.</li>
      <li>I have the original Curve as well.</li>
      <li>I have about 10 difference cheaper colognes now, and Curve Soul is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>and if you are with a special woman, I would recommend this.  </li>
      <li>Quick ship and well protected.</li>
      <li>I received within a decent time period and the price was okay.</li>
      <li>He and his wife were quite happy that you supply it and for such a reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>the reviewers who say that it smells exactly like the original curve.</li>
      <li>This is like the third time I&#x27;m getting this particular cologne, the reason is so simple smells real good not too sweet but fresh, give it a try.</li>
      <li>I would certainly keep this as my primary /everyday cologne - right after(or</li>
      <li>Curve soul by Liz Claiborne does have a nice woodsy, spicy smell but does not last longer than 2-3 hours.</li>
      <li>It has a soft scent that ladies love.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a masculine scent without being at all musky, and it&#x27;s clean without being too light.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim, considering the price was right.  </li>
      <li>I have a friend at work that fell in love with this particular brand of Curve, but has not been able to find it in a very long time.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a nice \\&quot;plan B\\&quot; type of cologne for when you want to switch it up and not pay alot for a big bottle of a decent brand.</li>
      <li>He is in his 80&#x27;s as soon as this gets low he calls me &amp; I order more for him.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say this is for the younger crowd for sure.</li>
      <li>I find Soul well rounded and masculine, the latter being most important to me.  </li>
      <li>Top notes a very different.</li>
      <li>the size of this is great and will last me a long time.  </li>
      <li>Good for all seasons and everyday use, and girls like it.</li>
      <li>This is a good everyday scent to wear for young men, sweet, spicy, and long-lasting.</li>
      <li>Nice dark smell</li>
      <li>I think this is more for older men, maybe even seniors not for younger people.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> light and refreshing, many compliments when i wear it. and for the price you cant beat it at all all</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling cologne ever!</li>
    <li> This is such a hot cologne, Liz Claiborne did it again!!  This is so sexy and it lasts all day!! It&#x27;s definitely a great buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few of the Curve colognes (most recently Crush which is not bad), but I have to say that Soul is my new favorite. It has a soft scent that ladies love. The name of the cologne should give you a hint that Soul is a soft, sensual scent.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it...what else could I want?  But, everytime I wear it someone compliments it- it&#x27;s a masculine scent without being at all musky, and it&#x27;s clean without being too light.  Great price for a great cologne.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne.  Cant find it local and bought a couple bottles!  Unbelievable price and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I have a friend at work that fell in love with this particular brand of Curve, but has not been able to find it in a very long time. He and his wife were quite happy that you supply it and for such a reasonable cost. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is like the third time I&#x27;m getting this particular cologne, the reason is so simple smells real good not too sweet but fresh, give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the rave reviews for it. I thought this would have some type of masculinity to it considering it&#x27;s look and the name \\&quot;SOUL\\&quot; but I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and the original Curve scent. Now I guess that&#x27;s a good thing if you like a sweet and light basic cologne smell, but I like a bit more masculinity to my colognes. I wouldn&#x27;t mind wearing it out and I will be testing the effects of the scent (unknowingly, lol) on the women I am around to see if it&#x27;s worthy enough to wear. The main reason behind my use of cologne is to help attract the opposite sex, and I noticed most women are attracted to a woody and spice scent. If you&#x27;re like me and looking for a Curve with a nice spice and masculinity to make women from all corners of the earth float to you then I&#x27;d suggest Curve Kicks or Curve Connect. If you&#x27;re looking for something to wear casually to smell \\&quot;good\\&quot; in the day time then I&#x27;d recommend this. Again, not a bad scent but not my ideal type.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim, considering the price was right.  At first I loved it - it&#x27;s a combination of spices that at first is very inviting (and very different from the original Curve).  But after about a month or so, I&#x27;ve gotten a bit bored with this fragrance and it&#x27;s on the shelf.  I will still wear it when I&#x27;m out of something else, etc., but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others.  I do, however, really love Curve Wave.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, deeper notes as the fragrance wears than I would expect from the lighter notes in the beginning.  I find Soul well rounded and masculine, the latter being most important to me.  To reiterate, I very nice surprise and a quality fragrance that lasts.  Quick ship and well protected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my son&#x27;s favorite parfume and I purchased it because of his birthday.&lt;br /&gt;He wears it for about 5 years and never turned to something else.</li>
    <li> Smell does nto stay for a long time...it smells good when you spray but it seems like the scent losses its fragrance right the other moment...Does not stay for a second...Would not recommend it to anyone...Or maybe I got a wrong supplier...I am not sure but there is something funky in the perfume...</li>
    <li> I received a great bargain when I purchased this NEW cologne that I have never had the opportunity to smell its scent, but based on the description, I liked what I read and decided to try. I am very happy that I did, because I was able to buy this 3.4oz  bottle at a very cheap price, and it&#x27;s worth the price! Good service from the seller too! I&#x27;ll be back to purchase more colognes on AMAZON because one can buy great and authentic colognes for very cheap prices, but they&#x27;re NOT cheap or fake imitations colognes at all!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from a third party, and this is a differnt smell and very weak, not the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should not affiliate with these type of bogus business practices.  It&#x27;s also very difficult to return to a third party. Trying to call Amazon is another issue. If you can even fish out how to contact them ,then you have to imput your own phone num,ber and they call you.  Its all set up so its difficult to speak to anyone and to return anything.  I will never order through a third party again.</li>
    <li> I bought it because as advertised here, it says, &amp;#34;for Men&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Cologne&amp;#34;.  I heard all of the wonderful reviews of how the ladies love it.  I didn&#x27;t know how it was supposed to smell, and so when I smelled it, I noticed it had an odd smell for a &amp;#34;cologne,&amp;#34; but I was still led to believe that I had cologne.  After a while it dawned on me that this has a girly perfume smell.  I looked on the box and it read &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; on it.  I didn&#x27;t know Curve even made perfume.  I was very disappointed, and perhaps more disappointed in the fact that I threw the box away.  I would consider returning it if I still had the box.  They either mis-packaged my order, or mis-advertised here.  I was given perfume.</li>
    <li> I have always been very fond of regular Curve on my husband but was looking for a different scent for him. After reading the reviews I decided to get this for him, since the others were so nice smelling on him. It smells awesome. Its my new favorite smell on him :)</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I wear. I love it</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and it does not sell in the stores. Great to see I can still get it.  I would like to get it in a bigger size, as I have in the past. I received within a decent time period and the price was okay.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  He didn&#x27;t expect to like it, but when he sprayed it on, we both liked it, not too strong and a very nice manly scent.</li>
    <li> After buying Mambo cologne I&#x27;ve learn to fall in love with the Liz Claiborne products.  This is another one of my favorites and is good to wear for any season except the summer because it is somewhat sweet.  Nice dark smell and if you are with a special woman, I would recommend this.  Not necessarily in the clubs because its a little too strong, a little too dark but one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> The product I received was obviously diluted with alcohol, decreasing its staying power. The scent would evaporate in a matter of minutes. I found the 1.7oz at Marshalls for $8. I suggest you do the same.</li>
    <li> My father loves this. He is in his 80&#x27;s as soon as this gets low he calls me &amp; I order more for him.</li>
    <li> HARD TO FIND STUFF RIGHT HERE!!!! This is best CURVE outside of CURVE!</li>
    <li> My wife had purchased the women&#x27;s curve vintage soul many times before and we really liked its smell. When it was time to buy a new cologne for me - I decided to give the men&#x27;s curve soul a try. Should not have waited that long. I LOVE it and so does she.   It&#x27;s got a warm wood gentleness to it and not SO strong that it hits you but strong enough to gently remind you of its warm presence. It doesn&#x27;t last all day I&#x27;d say but that&#x27;s how I like it - to let it wear off as the day wears off. Besides I use it at work so don&#x27;t want it to be too strong - workplace rules.     The price was great but I would&#x27;ve paid more regardless. I would certainly keep this as my primary /everyday cologne - right after(or next to) Armani by Georgio Armani.</li>
    <li> Just like described fast shipping ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Kurt</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Curve Soul for women so I purchased this for my man and was very pleased with the amazing scent. Curve for men was once my favorite cologne to smell on a man, but I have since changed my #1 from that to Curve Soul for men.</li>
    <li> I have about 10 difference cheaper colognes now, and Curve Soul is by far my favorite! I have the original Curve as well. I like Soul much better. It is slightly spicier, cleaner, and stronger. It lasts really long on my clothes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the reviewers who say that it smells exactly like the original curve. I completely disagree. Top notes a very different. Curve is much more synthetic. After a few hours, there is a slight resemblance, but I find this scent to be a much better overall scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this cologne!</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; Recently, but when I got it I was extremely disappointed to find that they had in fact sent me a perfume. The box looked exactly the same, but it said was for women instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son...it&#x27;s the only cologne he ever uses.  It smells great and a really good value.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my future brother in law.  He loved it.  Great product and unique style of a bottle.</li>
    <li> this is a great price for the amount of product.  I was surprised by how giant the bottle is! Love this scent on my boyfriend!</li>
    <li> I bought 3 different types of highly rated colognes, my wife picked this one as second place after Bvlgari Pour Homme Soir (but better than Acqua De Selva). I like Acqua De Selva the best, but hey, it&#x27;s not about me.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and the person loved the gift.</li>
    <li> Soul is by Curve, and you can smell the similarity to the original. However it still has its own character and I like it better than all the other Curves. Very citrusy with a spicy tinge to it.  Kind of exotic, like a holiday in the Orient. Doesn&#x27;t have the depth and sophistication of an Armani or Eternity, but is also way cheaper. Smells much more expensive than it is.  Good for all seasons and everyday use, and girls like it. Can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore, and I see the price has risen a few bucks from when I bought it several months ago. Best get it now while you can. As with any scent, if you haven&#x27;t smelled it before you should probably try the small bottle first, but if you like the original Curve you&#x27;ll probably like Soul.</li>
    <li> I love the Curve line of men&#x27;s colognes and I think that &#x27;Soul&#x27; is my favorite. Has a smooth, pleasing scent that isn&#x27;t overbearing. And of course the packaging and bottle look cool too, which for me, adds a visual appeal to fragrances. Only thing is like most lower end scents, it doesn&#x27;t last all day. Or at least on me it doesn&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s a nice \\&quot;plan B\\&quot; type of cologne for when you want to switch it up and not pay alot for a big bottle of a decent brand.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent!  the size of this is great and will last me a long time.  Wish it were more available in my area.</li>
    <li> Guys... I probably have seven (7) - maybe more now that I think about it - other Claiborne (i.e. Curve) fragrances and would say that I am a fan... I received Soul as a Christmas present (and four other bottles) from Sweetie and I love it... (there is some sentimental value in there too..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soul is a very pleasant fragrance that reminds me of the original Dior Fahrenheit, opening with a blend of aquatic, herbal, and \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; notes then settling into a musky fragrance that is easy on the nose.  It is not too distant from the original Curve.  I am, however, disappointed in the projection/sillage and longevity of Soul, finding it only has (at best) average longevity - lasting about 3-4 hours on the skin and clothing.  I prefer a solid 8 hours that can get me through the work day.  The solution is simple - pack the bottle and reapply as needed - I just did during the lunch break..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is the first day wearing Soul and no compliments, i.e. the Wow Factor, have been received yet.  No worries though - Sweetie has already \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; the juice with a thumbs up and a \\&quot;whoa, that smells great - what is it..??\\&quot; comment when I took it out of the bottle.  It has potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soul is packaged nicely and gives the impression of something more expensive.  I am very fond of the Soul label, highlighting the words, \\&quot;Love\\&quot;, \\&quot;Passion\\&quot;, \\&quot;Hope\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Truth\\&quot; - words to live by...  Minor deduction in \\&quot;cool points\\&quot; on the nozzle - while the amount of spray is generous and sufficient, it looks \\&quot;cheaply\\&quot; manufactured.  Again, slight deduction, from a nicely designed bottle/label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those enthusiasts with a big collection, or those on a budget, the real beauty of Soul is the price/value.  Similar to other Claiborne fragrances, a large bottle can be purchased for under $20.00.  Great deal (and scent) for the money..!!  Soul also offers great flexibility/versatility to be worn during any season, time of day, or any event - I think it will work well for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tally for Soul is 4.3 stars out of five - if the longevity were greater, it would probably be close to my Top 10 list.  Ride the wave and don&#x27;t ask where it goes..!!any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tally for Soul is 4.3 stars out of five - if the longevity were greater, it would probably be close to my Top 10 list.  Ride the wave and don&#x27;t ask where it goes..!!</li>
    <li> This scent is great for most men.  I bought for my father.  He loves it and my mom to!!!  He gets lots of complements.</li>
    <li> Curve soul by Liz Claiborne does have a nice woodsy, spicy smell but does not last longer than 2-3 hours.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant purchasing this cologne but I am so happy with how this turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial scent is spicy and sweet, with a bit of synthetic smell to it. This lasts about 30 minutes until the scent evolves into sweet green apples, lavendar, bamboo, and leather. At the end of the day the wearer smells like leather, sandlewood, and spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a long lasting scent, but it evolves throughout the day, I&#x27;d suggest wearing it casually on a daily basis, it is definitely a warmer scent meant to be worn for Spring or Fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL:DR This is a good everyday scent to wear for young men, sweet, spicy, and long-lasting. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> First time i used it it smelled pretty good (or so i thought)... but go bored with it fast. I think this is more for older men, maybe even seniors not for younger people. Gave it to my dad after couple of days.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the extra fast delivery.  Happy to have one of my favorite fragrances once again!</li>
    <li> I bought this to find out what the hell bamboo smelled like, well apparently rather sweet and woody at the same time. Nice scent for a night in the house, lounging, what not. I&#x27;d say this is for the younger crowd for sure.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but it lacks hang time. It usually dissipates within 2 hours of wearing it. I think the hang time should be stronger. I think it is a good deal though!</li>
    <li> I have never used this one before, my lady likes it. Wish the smell lasted a little longer, price was high too! Will recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to cologne&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s been a struggle to find a good one for my husband that I can tolerate, and that we both like. We could never really agree on anything, until I bought this! I came across a young gentleman who smelled so good, I HAD to ask what he was wearing. He was wearing Soul. I couldn&#x27;t believe the incredible price/value for the size bottle! I surprised my husband with this, and he LOVES it! When he puts it on, I can hardly contain myself ;o)</li>
