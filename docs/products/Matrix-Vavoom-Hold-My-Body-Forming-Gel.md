    <li> Very disappointed with this product once it arrived at home.  I have been searching for this product as Matrix stopped producing it.  I still have some of the original product but i was hoping to store-up with a few more bottles.  Once the product arrived it was very clear and evident this was not the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.  The consistency, smell and performance of the gel was not the same.  Down to the product packaging was not the same.  Very disappointed and home Amazon takes the necessary steps to assure customers receive products as advertised.</li>
