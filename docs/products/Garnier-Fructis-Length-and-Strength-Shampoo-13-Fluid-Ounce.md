      <li>A+ seller loved the product will reorder again thank you;)</li>
      <li>Have used it 2x and seems pretty good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and shiny and smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>Also within a week of using this product, the texture of my hair changed from fine, to a thicker texture, i dont know how it did it but</li>
      <li>Also, It smells FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>I *have to* condition afterwords, so after using the matching conditioner, my hair was light and</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying such a good product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been awhile now, and my hair is soooooo much shinier &amp; healthier &amp; more manageable.</li>
      <li>I was using Dove for a while, but the most recent bottle I bought was really drying out my hair, so I bought this stuff because I&#x27;ve heard that Garnier is really good for the price.</li>
      <li>Some quick history:  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, there&#x27;s a lot of it on my head because unfortunately, a good handful of hair usually comes out every time I wash my hair.</li>
      <li>I will purchase more as long as it is available</li>
      <li>Maybe it just takes a few days to switch shampoos successfully;</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so very soft and shiny, and actually gives me amazing volume, i have very fine hair, and it takes alot of work after i wash it to give it volume, such as putting alot of volumizing gels and volume hair spray.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After the first wash</li>
      <li>Sodium Laueth Sulfate&#x27;s only function in shampoo (and also in toothpaste) is to make the product appear more foamy.</li>
      <li>if it ever gets discontinued, i will be really messed up for like a month!</li>
      <li>This with one wash, can&#x27;t wait to see it after several more washes.</li>
      <li>Only use twice, so not enough time to make a fair judgement.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I have straight, baby-fine hair.</li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>I love the way the bottle is shaped and how careful the sender packaged it.</li>
      <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair very combable.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo for long hair it softens the hair without weighing it down and reduce split ends.</li>
      <li>This one left my hair very clean, but not dried out.</li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly and trouble free.</li>
      <li>I just kinda figured as I got older, my hair was getting less-resilient and,</li>
      <li>The shampoo is decent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, if you have fine hair and want volume, don&#x27;t buy this because you&#x27;ll probably feel like it&#x27;s weighing your hair down too much, but if you&#x27;re going to the longer hair smoother look, then this might be for you.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this is authentic.</li>
      <li>, my hair felt really flat and weighed down (it&#x27;s normally soft and light), and by the end of the day, it was feeling super greasy and sticky and gross.</li>
      <li>My hair is better now and getting longer and longer, and now I&#x27;m not seeing hardly any hair in the drain after I shampoo my hair, and I get tons of compliments.</li>
      <li>Hair is so silky and soft.</li>
      <li>Turns out, after the third and fourth wash (still washing every other day), my hair feels absolutely lovely.</li>
      <li>mainly because I had 2 back surgerys</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
      <li>but if you found such an amazing hair product and it got discontinued, wouldn&#x27;t you be sad?  </li>
      <li>am 63 years old, have hair to the middle of my back -</li>
      <li>I totally had the same experience the first two times I used this, and was ready to throw it out, but figured I&#x27;d try it for at least a week before I made the final call.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So instead of waiting a day, I washed my hair again the next morning, and it still felt pretty weighed down, but was not as gross by the end of the day, so</li>
      <li>cause my hands were oddly free of the wet hair that usually wound around my fingers when I was rinsing out conditioner.</li>
      <li>And then... not long after using the product -- maybe my third or fourth shower with the stuff -- I was wondering if I&#x27;d somehow forgotten I&#x27;d already showered that day or something</li>

<li> can&#x27;t tell which is responsible, since I use one after the other, but I didn&#x27;t feel like residue was left or that it overly dried (some dryness is a given, since it has sulfates).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for beauty products, because the results are so subjective. My experience with Garnier Fructis Length &amp; Strength shampoo, though, was too dramatic to keep to myself. Some quick history:  I have straight, baby-fine hair. Fortunately, there&#x27;s a lot of it on my head because unfortunately, a good handful of hair usually comes out every time I wash my hair. Never thought much of it -- shedding hair is normal, amounts vary greatly, I&#x27;m not bald or anything so I figured that was just my thing. As I&#x27;ve gotten older (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now), it&#x27;s gotten worse but not enough to worry me or anything. I just kinda figured as I got older, my hair was getting less-resilient and, I guess, \\&quot;brittle\\&quot; is the word I used in the title, here. It didn&#x27;t *feel* like it was snapping off or anything, but the evidence was clogging my drain.   I didn&#x27;t consider this an issue I could do anything about, and after some experimenting with hair boosting treatments like Ookisa, Samy Fat Hair, and Thicker Fuller Hair -- with varying and not-terribly-remarkable results --  I resigned myself to whatever drugstore \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoo caught my eye, alternated with a clarifying or moisturizing or some kinda non-volume shampoo every week or so, just to mix things up.   I ran out of my non-volume shampoo a few weeks ago, and snagged this Garnier Fructis \\&quot;Length &amp; Strength\\&quot; with absolutely NO expectations -- didn&#x27;t even read the back of the bottle, that&#x27;s how casually I chose this product. I never imagined that a shampoo could actually strengthen hair, figured it was just another marketing ploy &amp; just hoped the shampoo would smell nice.  And it did!  And then... not long after using the product -- maybe my third or fourth shower with the stuff -- I was wondering if I&#x27;d somehow forgotten I&#x27;d already showered that day or something cause my hands were oddly free of the wet hair that usually wound around my fingers when I was rinsing out conditioner. Weird.   The next day, it happened again. Or, rather, didn&#x27;t happen: I *didn&#x27;t* shed my usual clump of hair.   Nor the next.  Nor the next.  It&#x27;s been awhile now, and my hair is soooooo much shinier &amp; healthier &amp; more manageable. And there seems to be more of it! I am gobsmacked. Seriously, I never in a million years would think a shampoo could make such a difference in hair, that is already dead tissue. I didn&#x27;t even use the accompanying conditioner!   I read the other reviews about this product weighing hair down or feeling greasy and I just don&#x27;t know... maybe some people&#x27;s hair absorbs suds or is hard to rinse or something but personally I&#x27;ve never had that problem with any shampoo, certainly not this one.  This one, as I&#x27;ve said, is magic!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair. I wash it very other day because otherwise it gets really dry and unpleasant. I was using Dove for a while, but the most recent bottle I bought was really drying out my hair, so I bought this stuff because I&#x27;ve heard that Garnier is really good for the price. Another reviewer said that it made her hair feel greasy and sticky. I totally had the same experience the first two times I used this, and was ready to throw it out, but figured I&#x27;d try it for at least a week before I made the final call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash, my hair felt really flat and weighed down (it&#x27;s normally soft and light), and by the end of the day, it was feeling super greasy and sticky and gross. So instead of waiting a day, I washed my hair again the next morning, and it still felt pretty weighed down, but was not as gross by the end of the day, so I didn&#x27;t wash at all the next day. Turns out, after the third and fourth wash (still washing every other day), my hair feels absolutely lovely. It&#x27;s soft and shiny and smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy at all. Maybe it just takes a few days to switch shampoos successfully; who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you have fine hair and want volume, don&#x27;t buy this because you&#x27;ll probably feel like it&#x27;s weighing your hair down too much, but if you&#x27;re going to the longer hair smoother look, then this might be for you. I&#x27;d totally buy this again.</li>
    <li> It works great, my hair already feels stronger and healthier!! Also, It smells FANTASTIC. I love the way the bottle is shaped and how careful the sender packaged it.</li>
    <li> I use this product alongside the shampoo, and it&#x27;s wonderful. I have very thick hair, and don&#x27;t need to use a lot like I do with other products. And, it smells fabulous! Usually lasts two months when using 1-2x a week.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat tempermental relaxed afro-texted hair. I have used both shampoos that were too gentle (sulfate-free ones) or too harsh for my hair. This one left my hair very clean, but not dried out. I *have to* condition afterwords, so after using the matching conditioner, my hair was light and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell which is responsible, since I use one after the other, but I didn&#x27;t feel like residue was left or that it overly dried (some dryness is a given, since it has sulfates).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner solved any oil loss, yet rinsed out cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it may be best for relaxed/curly/thick hair types.</li>
    <li> For some reason, Garnier has discontinued the Length &amp; Strength products.&lt;br /&gt;I am 63 years old, have hair to the middle of my back - this product (along with the conditioner) has made my hair healthier than I have ever had in my life.&lt;br /&gt;Strong, silky, soft.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not colored - has a good mix of silver with the brown - this treats both types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU AMAZON for helping me to find a distributor that still has some.</li>
    <li> A+ seller loved the product will reorder again thank you;)</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my medication induced hair loss. It has helped, I use it wit fall fight conditioner so the combo is good.  It was delivered quickly and trouble free.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price.  Fast service.</li>
    <li> Hair is so silky and soft. This with one wash, can&#x27;t wait to see it after several more washes. Best!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for long hair it softens the hair without weighing it down and reduce split ends.</li>
    <li> I love all Garnier products</li>
    <li> This Garnier Length &amp; Strength Shampoo and Conditioner is the best hair product i have ever used! It makes my hair so very soft and shiny, and actually gives me amazing volume, i have very fine hair, and it takes alot of work after i wash it to give it volume, such as putting alot of volumizing gels and volume hair spray. With this all i have to do with this is just shampoo and condition, then blow dry and i have amazing volume and shine.  I love the smell of it, kind of smells like sweet smelling citrus.  i will always continue to buy this shampoo and conditioner for as long as its sold, if it ever gets discontinued, i will be really messed up for like a month! Lol over reaction, i know, but if you found such an amazing hair product and it got discontinued, wouldn&#x27;t you be sad?  Also within a week of using this product, the texture of my hair changed from fine, to a thicker texture, i dont know how it did it but its amazing.  And it deffinetly feels stronger. And i dyed my hair on december 23rd 2013, and here it is january 4th 2014 and i see my roots growing our quite a bit!!  I really dont know how you did it Garnier, but you&#x27;ve made an amazing S&amp;C that i will buy forever! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Garnier products, and this isn&#x27;t an issue. I have thick hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow out, and at first it left my hair feeling a little dry, after a week of using it it&#x27;s back to normal. It works fine for me (and I found it on a nice sale) some people seem to have problems with it if your hair is colored/treated (which I believe damages the hair before you even use this product).</li>
    <li> This shampoo should have stayed in stores. I am glad that I found it on amazon!!!  I will purchase more as long as it is available</li>
    <li> The shampoo is decent. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair very combable. The spray burns my scalp. My hair loss hasn&#x27;t changed and I have used the entire shampoo and conditioner. I won&#x27;t purchase anymore. On a good note, they smell good.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is authentic. Hum...Made hair very thin and shed. Only use twice, so not enough time to make a fair judgement. It definitely changed the texture of my black curl patterns :(</li>
    <li> This shampoo caused my hair to fall out. After using this product for a couple of weeks my shower drain would fill with hair each time I shampooed. I stopped using it and switched to a different brand of shampoo (Selson Blue) and my hair loss stopped and eventually my hair grew back. The ingredient Sodium Laureth Sulfate is the source of the problem. Sodium Laueth Sulfate&#x27;s only function in shampoo (and also in toothpaste) is to make the product appear more foamy. Sodium Laueth Sulfate is known to be a skin irritant, it contains carcinogens, and it should never be applied to your skin. Before purchasing this product do yourself a favor and Google &amp;#34;Sodium Laureth Sulfate&amp;#34; and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> has apple pectin in it which is suppossed to be great for hair.  Have used it 2x and seems pretty good.</li>
    <li> this shampoo aloud me to grow my hair to my belt line, a foot longer than ever before. they quit putting it on store shelf&#x27;s the end of 2012 &amp; my hair started to go bad till I found it here on amazon. I bought 4 of these but next time i&#x27;ll get the larger bottles. these tend to fall over, &amp; I don&#x27;t want to be bending over in the shower to pick up the soap haha mainly because I had 2 back surgerys</li>
    <li> I love Garnier Fructis Length and Strength Shampoo and loved that I could get it form Amazon! I had been looking for any source to get it, but couldn&#x27;t find any until I searched on Amazon and Viola! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for having this! My hair is better now and getting longer and longer, and now I&#x27;m not seeing hardly any hair in the drain after I shampoo my hair, and I get tons of compliments. Thanks for carrying such a good product!</li>
