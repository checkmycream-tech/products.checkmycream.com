<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Taking care of my face and using proudcts that I know are safe and will not harm my face is very important to me so I&#x27;m always looking for products that are all natural but actually work. Well I recently had the oppurtunity to try Foxbrim Natural Refresh Toner for free so I thought why not give it a try. What I really liked about this product was that is was all natural and one of the concerns I have with my face is dark spots and after using this product for a week I noticed that the spots had become lighter and my skin tone looked more even. This prouduct is also great for cleaning your skin and after using my skin felt cleaner and almost like it was tingling and I also noticed that my skin became tighter as a result of using this toner. My husband also tried out the product for some marks that he had on his head from hair clippers and he said that he really liked the proudct and could tell that the marks were becoming lighter- now he uses it everyday as well. I love this product and would defintely recommend it to others- since using this product my skin looks so much better and has a glow to it so if you are looking for a product like this be sure to check this product out!</li>
    <li> I love using facial toners and I really enjoy using Foxbrim’s natural refresh toner. This toner truly leaves my skin feeling and looking refreshed. After cleansing my skin I apply the facial toner. I like that it comes in spray bottle.This makes application quick and easy especially when your time is limited. Sometimes I like to spray the toner on a cotton round and apply to my face. Most of the time I just spritz it on my face and rub in. I can even spritz it on my face with my make-up on to help my face feel refreshed. The toner doesn’t really have a fragrance which is good for me since I have allergies and sometimes certain fragrances can irritate my allergies. I like that the toner prepares my skin for serums. I have used several toners before. Most of the toners that I have used in the past contained alcohol and always dried my skin out. This toner contains witch hazel which is beneficial for you skin without drying it out. This toner is definitely one of my favorites. If you are looking for a good toner that leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed without drying it out you should consider this toner.</li>
    <li> The natural toner works wonderful on my skin. I love how harsh chemicals are not being applied to my skin. I have being working on a skin regimen that would help clear my dark spots. I take biotin and skin hair and nails vitamins. Foxbrim in my opinion has a great skincare line. The ingredients are all natural. If you use all their skincare products, you will see greater results. My dark spots have gotten lighter and a few have disappeared. My skin feels cool, fresh and hydrated. If you are looking for a toner that is all natural and gentle on your skin, then try Foxbrim toner. You will see faster results when you  use as directed.</li>
    <li> MY REVIEW...&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should know by now I&#x27;m a huge fan of Foxbrim&#x27;s products.  I think I&#x27;m misusing one product and I&#x27;ll have the whole line, yeah me... This is their refreshing toner.  With all the natural ingredients I don&#x27;t see how it could be bad for my face.  Since using products that have vitamins, well natural ingredients period my face isn&#x27;t breaking out like a teenage boy hitting puberty.  Live this line of face products...</li>
    <li> One thing I use on a daily basis, is facial  toner. I can’t go one day without using it! I&#x27;ve noticed that it’s really hard to find a toner that doesn&#x27;t make you breakout, but maybe that’s because I have super-sensitive skin. This Naturally Refreshing Toner provides the essential toning for you to prepare your skin for cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner gently tightens pores, exfoliates dead skin cells and removes lingering dirt and grime. Foxbrim’s Natural Refresh Toner restores pH balance, which aids in a healthy and radiant glow. This product contains all-natural ingredients. No parabens. No additives. No added fragrances. This product is also NOT tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a high quality toner with an affordable price.</li>
    <li> This is a really great toner with all natural ingredients and no alcohol! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this toner! 100% natural! It comes in a wonderful spray bottle for the wonderfully lazy, like myself. Spray this stuff on, wipe it off, and you&#x27;re ready to carry on! It&#x27;s not the most appealing smell in the world, but it&#x27;s witch hazel. You can&#x27;t expect it to smell like roses!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product! Foxbrim’s Natural Refresh Toner is truly awsome. First off i love that this comes as a spray bottle. All you have to do is quick spray to your face and rub it in with your fingers or simply just let it dry while you are getting ready for the other steps. It is fabulous for glowing skin. Right away my skin looked dewy. My skin looked refreshed and felt great. I love that it is 100% natural and alcohol free. It is a great way to clean and prep your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this toner, keeps the oil level down in my skin but doesn&#x27;t dry it out too much. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which I like because I have smelled some gross toners. I would definitely recommend this toner!</li>
    <li> The Natural Refresh Toner from Foxbrim came in a white plastic bottle with a spray nozzle. It has a light gray label which is simple and nice. Before trying it, I read the directions first to make sure I am applying it right. I also tested it on my hand first to see if it would cause any reactions before I tried it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Natural Refresh Toner by Foxbrim has a water-like consistency and color and has a very subtle tangy scent. It dries up like water and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Natural Refresh Toner every night after I wash my face and put on my acne cream. Since this has Vitamin C included already, I skipped on my Vitamin C serum at night. I just spray it on my face directly and wipe off the excess droplets on my face using a cotton ball. It dries really quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how gentle the Natural Refresh Toner is. Even if I use it every night, I don&#x27;t get the dry, peeling skin on my chin and sides of the nose. It has made my skin less oilier and I like how it made my skin look fresh and hydrated. I only need 2 sprays for my whole face so that means this bottle will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subtle tangy scent is also very nice for me and the scent fades away after a few minutes. This didn&#x27;t cause me any skin reactions and it didn&#x27;t clog my pores too. I also like that this toner doesn&#x27;t sting my skin. I&#x27;ve tried toners which sting my skin after using it continuously so I am glad that this didn&#x27;t cause any stinging sensation.</li>
    <li> It has a nice bottle with a spray nozzle. After spritzing the toner on my face, it felt like an extra layer is added to the skin. Felt my skin tighten, soft and smooth and even more clean, refreshed but didn’t feel dry at all because this toner is alcohol free. It has a odd natural scent but the good news is, it didn’t last for ever!&lt;br /&gt;I think my skin glows nicely after I added “Foxbrim’s Natural Refresh Toner” to my daily skin care. Feel much better!</li>
    <li> This alcohol free, all natural toner is non-irritating and gentle, even though it contains the skin-tightening astringent witch hazel. Aloe is mixed into the formulation to provide soothing moisture and a green scent note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane), an anti-inflammatory, is also a key ingredient in this toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people feel witch hazel is an anti-inflammatory also; for me, it tends to have cleansing and oil reduction properties, but it does not necessarily reduce my normal redness levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of witch hazel plus MSM in this toner might be extra effective for individuals with sensitive skin that is prone to ruddiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a toner, this product is light and watery, not oily. It does not sting. You can dispense the toner using the built-in pump action spray nozzle, or you can spritz it onto cotton pads and then apply it that way. I prefer the cooling sensation of the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one element that might bother you, especially if you prefer your products to be unscented, is the way this toner smells--sort of green, medicinal and herbal. You can definitely tell a number of plants with medicinal properties have been added to the product. I feel the aloe note was partcularly strong, and this happens to be a scent I don&#x27;t like very much. But if you love the green, fresh smell of aloe, then this toner might smell extra good to you. In my case, I would have preferred a more floral or citrus scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it cleans anything, the cotton ball stays clean after using on my face. I cleaned my face after using this toner with my old toner and the cotton ball got pretty dirt. Feels just like water.</li>
    <li> This is a really effective toner, but part of the reason why I loved it so much was because of how reasonably priced this WAS, emphasis on the was. In less than a month, this company raised the price of this by 5 dollars. I will be on the hunt for a new toner because of the price hike. Ridiculous!</li>
    <li> Love this Toner ! Will buy again !!</li>
    <li> Enjoy the feeling of putting this on my face. The difference is noticeable on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Lavender Mist Toner, Vitamin C Lotion, and Ultra Light Night Cream for about a month now, and I love all three products. Dry spots on my face feel smoother for the first time in a long while. I also really like how the creams absorb quickly and don&#x27;t linger with an oily feeling. The toner smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a broken bottle in my first shipment. I contacted the company and they sent me a new bottle free of charge right away. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> Did not feel any difference in this toner.</li>
    <li> didnt work for me and its not able to return says in website..</li>
    <li> There were a lot of promises, but unfortunately, I did not notice any changes to my skin.</li>
    <li> nice product, good company</li>
    <li> Gets all the nitty gritty dirt right out of my face! phew!!!! thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product with natural ingredients. It leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean...oh and clearer! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and refreshing mist. A great toner and pick-me-up any time of day. Makes your face feel cool and tightens the skin after cleansing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes your skin so soft and supple.  I will buy this again</li>
    <li> I received the Refresh Toner instead of the Lavender Mist Toner by mistake~~BUT, it was a great mistake! The Refresh is a nice, energizing, cool splash(or spritz) to the skin~~I&#x27;m pretty particular about what I put on my face and Foxbrim products are GREAT!! After talking with Troy from Foxbrim, I found out that this product had been &amp;#34;reformulated&amp;#34; to the Lavender Toner, If the Lavender one is as great as the Refresh is, it&#x27;ll be a hit! I love that Foxbrim is all natural, cruelty free and made in the USA! They also have top notch customer service~Troy was quick to respond to my inquiry and had great follow through, I like that the company cares about their customers. I look forward to trying more products by the Foxbrim brand.</li>
    <li> This mist is awesome!! Contains aloe, witch hazel, vitamin C. I literally smells likr lavender. Its extremely soothing and calming i love to use this one at night after cleansing since the lavender relaxes me a lot. I also love how it comes in a spray tinted bottle, the tint helps preserve all thw good ingredients, and the spray makes its so easy to use without wasting to much product using cotton balls. I really love this toner. This is my honest opinions in trying this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toner! It is so refreshing, light, and natural. The spray applicator is great! I find that I use it as a spritz in the mornings to refresh my skin after waking up and before applying makeup. I like to spray it over the fact lightly and evenly and let soak in dry. At night, I like to spray a cotton pad and massage it over my skin after cleansing with a facial oil cleanser that I purchased on Amazon. This product can have a slight, pungent &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell, but it isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t linger. I prefer it greatly to a chemical perfume smell, for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been following a regiment of using natural products on my skin for about a week now, and I am noticing a huge difference in the appearance of and feel of my skin. It is softer, smoother, and clearer than it has been in a long time. I am pregnant and have been wanting to make a change for my changing skin, and this has been part of a very successful equation of cleanse, tone, moisturize that seems to be making all the difference! I also ordered some Manuka honey that I use as a mask between cleansing and toning a couple of times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving the brand, loving the product, and loving the results it is giving my skin! Great buy!</li>
    <li> this works wonders and I love it</li>
    <li> I actually have the Refresh Toner and I love it</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before buying this product and it&#x27;s a little disappointing. I know I was looking for a toner that had natural ingredients (or at least discernible ingredients), had pore-tightening effects, and had a decent scent. I had been using a different product for a few years and was looking for something new when I saw this on Amazon.  First of all, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s all-natural, but it is really light and it hasn&#x27;t caused me any issues with irritation, breaking out, or otherwise. If you&#x27;re looking for something to refresh your skin and tighten your pores (a little) after washing your face, this is a pretty good product.  However, I have a really sensitive sense of smell and this smelled absolutely horrible. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the witch hazel, but it made me cringe every time I used it. It has an almost astringent smell, and I had to dump a quarter of the product and mix in different essence samples (this is the before-lotion essence I am talking about, not any type of perfume) before I could put it on my face. Mixing all these products may have made it less effective, but there was absolutely no way I was going to be able to use this product otherwise. The smell goes away very quickly, but I just couldn&#x27;t do it.  All in all, it&#x27;s really great if you&#x27;re looking for something that is non-abrasive on your skin and works. However, do note that you might have to deal with the smell every time you put it on. For me, the scent of the products I use is extremely important, so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again (unless I was willing to mix it half and half with bottles of essence). I did see other reviews saying this had a nice scent, so maybe it&#x27;s just me that hates it...but it smells really weird.  EDIT: On a completely different note, customer service for this company is amazing and I would not falter in trying out new products that they may make in the future. They have a wide variety of products out already and they really do try to have the best quality with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I think I might give Foxbrim somewhat of a big head because this is the third product of theirs I&#x27;ve had the chance to review and it&#x27;s the third product I can honestly give 5 stars. This has been my absolute FAVORITE product of theirs so far. I could seriously sit and just smell the contents of the bottle, it smells of pure relaxation. Obviously it&#x27;s not intended to just smell good so I forced myself to stop smelling it and actually use it. My face feels flawless and smells amazing! My husband actually came up to me and smelled my face...slightly weird but hey, at least I know I&#x27;m not the only way who smells it!</li>
    <li> I am already using the Moroccan Orange Blossom toner, but decided to try this as well. Lavender is hit or miss with me; sometimes the smell of it is overpowering. I was excited when I saw that this was in a spray bottle. It&#x27;s a little different than the other toner, it has more ingredients in it (all recognizable, natural ingredients- nothing weird) and can be used multiple times a day as a refresher. After spraying it on my face I was pleased that the smell was not offensive whatsoever and did not linger. It was nice, cool, refreshing, and good for fixing those mid-day makeup meltdowns. I&#x27;m so thrilled with all of my Foxbrim products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a reviewer promotion for this product, but all opinions are my own. :)</li>
    <li> It had a pleasant smell, and wasn&#x27;t too sticky, I just don&#x27;t see any improvement of my skin.</li>
    <li> Mist Spray Facial Toner, 120mL/4oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshing is one of the words that happen for me when I started using the Foxbrim Lavender Mist Toner. The Lavender Toner is true to size for you get a lot for a fraction of the price. The Lavender comes out in a light mist and leaves behind the light scent of Lavender. I have noticed that my skin is looking fuller and I have incorporated it into my daily skin care. I do love Lavender and for those who don’t I still think you will love what it leaves behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.</li>
    <li> This product is great, i like it, is a good toner and im happy for this product, i got this in a discounted price, and i really wan to recommend this product .</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help hydrate my face this summer. I wanted the lavender version because of its antibacterial properties. The mist is very refreshing and smells great. This is real good after a day in the sun. It comes in a glass spray bottle, and has a fine mist sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being its 100% natural is also a plus and Its also alcohol free! I also have the non scented version/plain but the lavender really does make a huge difference in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several products from FOXBRIM. I have found all of them to be high quality and effective.  As for this Lavender I found it to be refreshing and the fact its natural makes it even better. I have bought the products I have from them because of what&#x27;s listed on the front label. However, the back of the label is where I find most of the products I get even excited over.  Ingredients like Witch Hazel, Vitamin C, Organic Aloe Vera, Yucca, Sage, Pomegranate, and other all natural healthy for the skin and body ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I keep mine in my crochet bag.  I crochet all day, because I have an Etsy shop I have to keep stocked, so I often crochet all night. Making me feel and look run down. He lavender refreshes my skin and it also helps me stay calm, so I ca go to sleep when I&#x27;m done, instead of having to wind down.&lt;br /&gt;Keep this in your bag to use throughout the day. Shake well to mix the ingredients. They separate a bit when sitting for a while.. Shaking insures you get the right combination of all of them..  I don’t like saying I LOVE THIS!, because everyone seems to say the same thing. But I can say I LOVE LAVENDER!! And this smells like real fresh lavender when shaken and sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;I love the items this company put out so far. I am looking forward to trying more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;br /&gt;My No Nonsense Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt; I could copy the description or retell you that you have already read in the description, But you&#x27;ve already read it. I will try and tell you what I see, Smell, hear, what happens, and my opinion as well as I can. So it&#x27;s easier for you decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br /&gt;As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /&gt; I have no connection to this seller and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I have never been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I don’t spellcheck or my dyslexia takes over.. But I will do my best to be honest with you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, and so far I like how it works. I have dry skin, so sometimes toners can be super drying to my skin and end up being worse for me than beneficial. I am happy to say that after using this every other day for the past 2 weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed any negative reactions. It cleans my skin, and really removes the grime from the day, yet does it in a gentle fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this like I said every other day just to be on the safe side since my skin is so dry. I wash my face first, then use this after to kinda do the &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34;. I like to use this with cotton rounds, and I use it all over my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are really only 2 things that I am not a huge fan about. First is the packaging that I have. I read some other reviews that have the same current packaging that I have, and they just weren&#x27;t fans of it as well. I noticed that the company did reply back stating they were changing the packaging to a mist form. This would be great because with the packaging that I currently have is easily prone to leaks. One thing that I might add is a safety seal as well. I feel much safer using a product that comes with a safety seal, especially skincare products. Second thing which I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of was the smell. However it is nothing too bad, it&#x27;s just more of a natural type of scent. The nice thing is that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do like this, and find it to be a nice product to have added into my skincare routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> amazing product, love how it feels on my skin.  Very easy to apply.  I wasn&#x27;t familar with toners, thanks to this wonderful product now i am</li>
    <li> This is the best toner I have used!  It removes any trace of old makeup left on the skin after normal cleansing and thus prevents blackheads and breakouts. Also helped keep my skin feeling moisturized through out the day!</li>
    <li> I love how this toner really makes my face feel refreshed and clean. It seems like it wakes my face up. It has a soft, simple smell and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Cleanse, TONE, serum and Moisturize! This should be your twice daily skin regime. This product is a great toner, I love that it is alcohol free because I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t want to feel a stinging sensation while toning, alcohol also has a tendency to dry out your skin. You can spray this on your face and wipe off with a cotton ball or spray directly on to the cotton ball and wipe around your face. Toning your skin helps get the residual makeup, dirt and debris from your face while also helping hydrate and firm your face. This has a pleasant smell and you get a lot of product for your money!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing and I love the idea of this product,  however it made me break out all over my face. I will definitely not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Great toner... But I noticed it &#x27;burned&#x27; my face somewhat, but made it look great. Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently, but it has great ingredients!</li>
    <li> Been using this every night after cleansing but it causes me to have really dry skin after. I have oily combination skin. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell nor the spray. Love that its organic though. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> LOve it! my face has never felt better. It is so hydrated and I love this toner. I am so upset that I have wasted my money on another toner for soooo long and just found out about this brand while doing a review. I have always had troubled skin and I am very nervous about what I put on my skin. So this was a big deal for me to start using this toner. I am so impressed and you have a lifelong customer now.</li>
    <li> I am a beauty product freak. I was excited for this toner. I needed a new one so bad. I have added this product to my everyday beauty regimen. Works just like a toner should. It removes any dead skin that my cleanser didn&#x27;t and preps my skin for the rest of my regimen!&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt stink either like some others I have tried!&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product at no cost in order to facilitate a review. This review is based on my own honest opinion of, and experience with, this product. Yours may differ</li>
    <li> I love that this is an all natural product and it makes my skin feel amazing</li>
    <li> Does not smell good at all</li>
    <li> This is another great product from Foxbrim! I love the pump that allows me to mist my face. The scent is nice and not overly strong. The best thing is that it makes my skin feel so good! I have particularly sensitive skin with rosacea. This product helps to calm and refresh my skin. I can really tell a difference in the redness on my cheeks. Great product! I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  This is a 4 oz tinted glass bottle with a spray dispenser. She really likes lavender scent, this one has the scent of sweet Lavender Angustifolia and Orange Blossom hydrosol.  They added moisturizing ingredients such as aloe and kelp, antioxidants like MSM, and astringent properties of Witch Hazel.  Great ingredients to fully load this toner like a night cream except it&#x27;s a skin toner!  Great that it can be used throughout the day as a facial mister, wife likes to spray her face mid day to refresh her tired skin.</li>
    <li> This serum makes your skin feel refreshed and clean. It&#x27;s perfect for all skin types, especially for those with acne. It won&#x27;t dry out your skin because it is alcohol free. The toner contains premium all-natural and organic ingredients. Add this to your daily routine to help keep your skin feel energized.</li>
    <li> To start of with I love the fact  that it is 100% natural refresh toner that has Witch Hazel +Aloe+ MSM+Vitamin C, Safe and effective for ALL skin types. It smells good and works great removing all the dirt and grime!!!&lt;br /&gt;Al you have to do is apply it with a cotton ball after washing your face.. Super easy. My skin is allergic to so much stuff and with this product I do not have to worry!! This is now my go to toner!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks FoxBrim for another great product!!!</li>
    <li> I have become a huge fan of all things by Foxbrim!  Foxbrim sent me the Natural Refresh Toner to review for them and it has found a permanent place in my skincare routine.  I really love Foxbrim products because they are made with natural ingredients and this toner is no different.  It leaves my skin feeling super clean but not stripped, which I love.  It balances my skin and leaves it in the perfect condition to apply the rest of my skincare products!</li>
    <li> I absolutely  love facial toners. I know lavender has recently been labeled, as being &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; for your skin, by some of the newer youtube gurus. I personally have been using it for years. Spas have been using it for years. There&#x27;s always some new fad of something that&#x27;s &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; for you. This is just one of those things. Personally my skin feels amazing after using this! I use it at night and when i wake up my skin is still refreshed, and soft! The smell also sticks around, which is such a soft lavender scent!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: i was sent this at a reduced price to review, but it in no way affects my opinions!</li>
    <li> Did you ever get home from work or from being outside and feel the need to clean your face?  I remember when I was a teenager using an astringent that made my face tingle, feel refreshed and best of all, clean.  I had the opportunity of reviewing a new and natural toner called #foxbrim.  It contains ingredients that are not &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; for you.  These include: witch hazel (seems old fashioned to me), aloe (Ahh- always a good ingredient) and vitamin C (interesting).  The bottle is made like a bottle of saline solution would be.  You pop the top and then squirt the astringent on a cotton ball.  There was a slight odor of plastic, which leads me to believe it is supposed to be unscented, and was I was smelling was literally the container.  It was a watery texture and I felt I had to soak the cotton ball.  It did feel natural going on, yet, I did not feel that refreshing/stinging feeling.  I did feel as if I had cleaned my face though.  I would not disregard this product as I am sure it is perfect for those with sensitive skin.  Another bonus is that it is all naural.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to review the Foxbrim&#x27;s Natural refresh toner and really liked it. I like that the bottle is a spray bottle and was very easy to use.  A few sprays is all you need for your face so the product lasts for a while. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or greasy when I use it, it makes my skin feel nice and refreshed. I used it each morning when I would wake up and it works great at tightening up your pores and when I had some dry skin on my face and rubbed in the refresh toner the dead dry skin would come right off. I love that it is all natural because I&#x27;m not a fan of harsh chemicals for my skin at all. One other thing that I love about this company&#x27;s line of product is that they have a money back guarantee. How many other company&#x27;s have that?</li>
    <li> Most toners I have used have alcohol in them. The alcohol always makes my skin burn when I use it. When I received my free sample, I was very happy when I found that this brand used all natural ingredients and had no alcohol. The witch hazel has even helped calm my red cheeks. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used once but it seems to be a good toner. It was delivered one day after it was promised but I&#x27;m sure that has more to do with the shipping company (USPS) and out of the control of the vendor so all in all, it was a good experience. Once I&#x27;ve had a chance to really use this product and determine how well I like it, I&#x27;ll decide whether to order more. *NOTE* I was not given any free samples, this review is from a consumer who used their own money to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I went to try this toner because I have acne caused by Lupus. However, I was pleasantly surprised and have now actually purchased a bottle. This toner did not have the strong chemical smell and feel that so many other toners do. It is advertised as being natural and alcohol free. It also has witch hazel in it, along with Aloe Vera and Vitamin C. I have used products with this combination before but never with the success of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product begin clearing my skin as soon as I used it. I could feel a difference in the texture of my skin, the way it looked, and could tell that it was clearing up the acne. I liked using it to take my makeup off, though it is not advertised for this purpose. I look forward to seeing what else this particular company has to offer. I am certainly hoping to find the right balance for my skin!</li>
    <li> Too soon to submit a  review.  I just started io use the toner.</li>
    <li> I love this natural and alcohol free toner. It does not dry out my skin whatsoever. I love how it fresh and clean my face feels after I apply it. Would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I am absolutely loving this toner! It is made with all natural and anti aging ingredients – properties that I gravitate towards. I noticed that it does a wonderful job as far as cleaning my skin and pores go. It’s also gentle on my crazy sensitive skin – so I can use it as much as I want! I have been using it in the morning before I put on my makeup, because it does help in shrinking my pores. I don’t have to use as much primer or foundation to hide my big pores and I love it! I also use it before I go to bed because it cleans all the dirt and makeup from my face and preps it for my other anti aging and moisturizing products. It truly is a great product that’s worth trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Feels amazing and no harsh chemicals for sensitive skin.  I have used this product for about a month now and have noticed the tone of my skin has already improved.  I will continue to use this product because I believe I will see even more results in the next few weeks/months. Love it! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c06fdd779585a300dc5409e28f79c969]] This lavender mist toner is so much fun to use! I know that sounds weird to say that an element of a skin regimen is \\&quot;fun\\&quot;, but it is! As I&#x27;ve attempted to capture in my video, the mist from this toner is so very fine, that it just feels great going on! It reminds me of the cooling misting showers that we have here at the zoo in New Orleans, so I guess that&#x27;s where I equate the fun in! But it really does an excellent job of refreshing my face, which is appreciated during these hot summer days. I use this toner morning and night during the week, and even more times than that during the weekend when I&#x27;m sans makeup, as I just love the way it makes my face feel. It only takes me 2 sprays each time, so 1 bottle lasts a long time. Since using it, I&#x27;ve noticed an overall more even tone to my skin,and the softness...oohhh the softness! I&#x27;ve also been complimented by friends as they&#x27;ve noticed a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; about my skin. The fragrance of lavender is absolutely lovely, as it&#x27;s  not overbearing when you put it on, yet is still fragrant enough to enjoy. The spray bottle sprays a very even mist which comes out easily and lightly so you needn&#x27;t worry about having a large amount of product just dumped upon you. This is the second toner that I&#x27;ve tried from Foxbrim, and they definitely did not disappoint, yet again! I never thought I could find a toner that I love as much as their orange blossom water toner,[[ASIN:B00UHS7CGU Orange Blossom Water Toner - 100% All-Natural Face Toner - Beautiful Floral Water - To Tone &amp; Refresh Skin - Balance pH and Skin Moisture - Alcohol Free - Imported from Morocco - Renowned Neroli Distillate/Hydrosol - Perfect For A Complete Beauty Regime...]] but this one is equally as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted for evaluation</li>
    <li> Foxbrim has created yet another great skin product.  I have not been let down so far, and this is no exception.  I have always heard about the healing benefits of witch hazel but never really used it.  This toner is alcohol-free and is all-natural.  So it won&#x27;t dry out your skin, and it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly without leaving behind any residue.  You are left with fresh and smooth feeling skin and you know that it is working to repair skin problems too.  You use this just like any other toner you would buy in the store, using it to clean your face in the mornings if that is your regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner comes in a large 4 oz bottle so it will last a while for you.  There are NO parabens or fillers/additives in this toner, just natural goodness that will leave your skin feeling so good.  Plus Foxbrim has a money-back guarantee, so you have no reason to not give it a try!  Another upside is that Foxbrim does not mass-produce their skin products, they make them in small batches to maintain the integrity of their products.  I haven&#x27;t been disappointed in any of them yet :)  I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
    <li> This product really surprised me.  I&#x27;ve never used a toner before--honestly, I thought it was an unnecessary step to your beauty regimen.  However, I quickly found out that my skin was thirsty for a product like this.  I noticed that not only did my skin not dry out, but it was acne-free and it just seemed like my skin was brighter.  I didn&#x27;t notice any negative reactions to this product.  I love that it&#x27;s alcohol-free and all-natural.  My only complaint is the smell.  I hate the smell--I couldn&#x27;t deal with it.  Luckily, the smell wears off pretty soon, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell and so I was hoping it would smell better.  I love that it&#x27;s a spray so that I don&#x27;t have to waste cotton balls or Kleenex to rub this on my skin.</li>
    <li> This face toner is amazing!It cleans, smoothen and brighten my skin.I love it too that it&#x27;s not so harsh in my face.It&#x27;s good o removed make ups too.I got this product with a discount but this is really more worth with the price. I will absolutely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I like their products. I just received this product and started using it. I think this toner is good for whitening, perfect for someone who&#x27;s looking for brighter skin since it contains aloe, vitamin c, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, when I received it, it was spilled. It was bubble wrapped but need to seal it.</li>
    <li> We had the chance to try this great product for free, the opinions are my own. My wife tried Foxbrim&#x27;s Natural Refresh Toner to try to get rid of some of the acne on her skin. She doesn&#x27;t get a ton of acne, but at some moments she does. This was one of those moments. She was excited about this product because it was all-natural and she knew it was not going to be harsh on her skin. She also was happy to know that the product had vitamin C in it. She has used Vitamin C Serum in the past and it did great things for her skin. This product worked great on the little bit of acne my wife was dealing with. It also left her skin feeling refreshed, without that dry feeling you can get from other products that contain alcohol. Now my wife&#x27;s skin is clean and feels refreshed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to the toners that I use on my face. I have combination/oily skin so a lot of toners don&#x27;t work for me without making my skin feel more oily. I was excited to try this Lavender toner from Foxbrim. I&#x27;ve bought products from them before and love their customer service and their products. One thing that stood out to me about their product is that it&#x27;s 100% natural and alcohol free. Witch hazel helps clean and tighten pores. The aloe in the product is there to help moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner is not only refreshing but it smells amazing and is so very relaxing. I only use it once a day unless I feel like my skin needs a refresher mid-day. If you aren&#x27;t happy with the product (but I think you will be), Foxbrim offers a total satisfaction guaranteed and will refund you the purchase price with no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW.

    <li> When I went on the hunt for a good facial toner on amazon, I looked through lots of products and almost ordered a couple, but the deal killer was that they contained alcohol. My skin is acne-prone and does NOT react well to products with alcohol, which I&#x27;d say a majority of toners have. Then I found Foxbrim&#x27;s toner-- alcohol-free! Plus, some nice extra ingredients the skin-savvy love to see: MSM, vitamin C, yucca, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this once a day for a month, here are the benefits I have found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I can see that the little clogged comedones on my forehead are now almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;- My skin produces less oil throughout the day, and my makeup stays in place better than before.&lt;br /&gt;- It seems to help my more &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; products to absorb better (like Retin A and niacinamide), and I have been getting faster results with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the smell some people mentioned: yep, that is witch hazel. It&#x27;s fairly mild, but very recognizable. Personally I prefer the natural scent to &amp;#34;fruity cupcake&amp;#34; or something artificially made like that. Overall I am very happy with my purchase. The results are not crazy dramatic, but exactly what I expect from a good toner, and it is a great &amp;#34;middle step&amp;#34; in a full routine.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lavender mist facial toner. I like that it is 100% Natural &amp; Alcohol Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and refreshing. It doesn&#x27;t linger long but provides a nice uplifting scent that is pleasant. I like to mist my face in the morning before applying my makeup and then at night after I was washed up for bed. It isn&#x27;t greasy and completely absorbs within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a nice pump top that delivers a good amount of product with just one plunge. A little bit is all you need and this bottle will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also good for a pick me up after lunch when the carb laden meal takes hold. Spritz your face a couple of times and relax while you feel the droplets sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a great addition to your daily facial care program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I love face toners and this one is no exception. When it arrived it had been leaking and dried all over the bottle druing shipping.  Even though the seller/manufactur has tried with a shipping wrap around the top. But no problem, I cleaned it off and opened it up so I could use it. I dont spray onto a pad like directions say, I just spray directly on my face. I love the cool mist it sprays and the scent of natural lavender is so nice. Lavender itself is so good for the skin and even sunburns, cuts and scrapes.  I will use this toner not only for my face but for all the others things as well.  I would recommend this product to anyone and I am so honored that I got a discount to review this toner.</li>
    <li> As advertised, but with slightly medicinal odor that takes some getting used to. It&#x27;s probably the healthy ingredients!</li>
    <li> LOVE it!!!  No more oily T-Zone, my face is balanced.  I spritz it on immediately after washing my face, Then I apply Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C Amino Complex &amp; Hyaluronic Acid, then their Youthful Eye Radiance Cream, then their Advanced 1% Retinol Complex (Vitamin A &amp; Antioxidants).  My 65 year old skin has NEVER looked better!</li>
