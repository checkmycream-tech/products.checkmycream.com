<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have one all of my piercings with these needles, and I have my belly, and both second holes done. The needles are neat, they do come very sterile all you have to know is how to pierce whatever part of your body and you are good to go with these guys!!</li>
    <li> These needles are extremely sharp and make piercing very easy.  I would not recommend piercing any cartilage at home unless you are an experienced piercer because it can be dangerous and painful.  I pierced my lobes with these and it worked perfectly.  It fits a normal piercing earring (like one you would get at Claire&#x27;s or Piercing Pagoda) nicely inside the opposite end so it&#x27;s easy to pull the jewel through.  My new piercing didn&#x27;t hurt at all afterwards.  I wasn&#x27;t in the rush to get these so the shipping time didn&#x27;t bother me at all (around 2 weeks).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too thin that it didn&#x27;t even hurt! But that&#x27;s a problem bc when I pierced my navel with it, the actual jewelry didn&#x27;t fit thru. I had to immediately use a bigger needle.. my friends one and that hurt a little. But over all I had to take it out bc when my friend did it on me I lay straight, bad idea bc it came out to be crooked! You should always mark it or do it by standing up maybe! So I decided to take it off and my piercing closed up completely healed no irritation in a week! Maybe in the future I&#x27;ll give it another shot professionally! But these needles are way too thin. Waste of $$$. Give less needles but make one that&#x27;s usable!</li>
    <li> i used this hollow needle to pierce my cartilage and it worked perfectly. the needle went in smooth and was very sharp. thank you!</li>
    <li> is it 50 or 100 needles for that price.. or just  five needles..</li>
    <li> I wanted to self pierce my own ears. The needles arrived quickly and were packaged perfectly.  I was impressed with the way they were professionally sterilized and ready for use. When I did pierce my ears, it was easy, and smooth. Great customer service from this seller.  I will for sure purchase from them in the future.</li>
    <li> I pierced my cartilage with these it turned out well! It didn&#x27;t get infected either.  They were very sharp. :)</li>
    <li> I order them and got them within 1day which is awesomely fastt the packing was super neat and clean easy to open i piercing my lip \\&quot;snakebites\\&quot; it was super easy to use they were sharp so it went right threw and i didnt even feel it im totally going to use again :)</li>
    <li> These needles are great! I needed them for self piercings (tragus and tongue web) and these worked great! They&#x27;re so sharp it barely hurt! And they are definatley sterilized! So no worries. If anyone is doing self piercings i DEFINATLEY recommend these!</li>
    <li> I used these needles to pierce my nipples and they worked just fine! i bought them along with a clamp and they did the job extremely well. Just added a little bit of antibiotic ointment to the needle and it slipped through great. They come sterilized and in a pack of 5. Will be buying more for any future piercings!</li>
    <li> I was kinda scared ordering these needles especially when I got them. The top was alittle intimidating but when I used it, it went through my lip no problem. And it really didn&#x27;t hurt....at all. The needles came completely sterile and amazingly sharp, I was very satisfied :) The only thing is, I would get them bigger because when I tried to put the stud inside of the needle, it didn&#x27;t fit, still had no problem getting the stud in my lip though</li>
    <li> these needles were amazing! &amp; so was the seller! my needles came a day earlier than expected and the packaging was in excellent condition.i used the needles to pierce my cartilage, and when i stuck it through my ear i felt absolutely NOTHING! they are super sharp and went through my ear like... butter! the only thing i had trouble with was getting the earring in the hole of the needle, but it worked after a while. overall though, these are amazing needles from an amazing seller, i would definitely buy from them again! (:</li>
    <li> After watching my friend pierce his lip with a safety pen I knew I would be buying needled if a wanted anything done. So this was the first product i found and wow thay are so sharp! It&#x27;s like a little knife at the end of it! It went through so easy and it didn&#x27;t hurt (I have no tolerance for pain) thanks so much:)</li>
    <li> These worked great while re-piercing my ears. It does take a bit of pressure to get through the ear. But it is a good alternative instead paying for someone to pierce them.</li>
    <li> The needles are very sharp so I was able to pierce my Marilyn by myself.  The one thing I would do differently is to buy a larger gauge needle.  16 gauge means it&#x27;s the same outer diameter as a 16 gauge piercing, so you can&#x27;t put the jewelry inside the needle to follow it through your lip.  I had to remove the needle and try to pop the jewelry through the hole (not fun!!).  I would recommend  getting your needles two sizes larger than your jewelry (for example buy a 14 gauge needle to insert a 16 gauge piece of jewelry).</li>
    <li> These worked great! I pierced my ears 3 weeks ago and man these were sharp. They went in real smooth and the only pain I felt was the sharp tip going through the skin however, once in it&#x27;s over. While still in my new ear piercing hole, I placed the earring on the end, pulled the needle out and placed the back on the earring, then cleaned up my ear. They were very easy to use and I am loving my new piercings.</li>
    <li> Product received was exactly the product described, and was delivered VERY quickly. Completely exceeded all of my expectations! I would definitely recommend buying from Arizona Tattoo Supply. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered these on Friday 3.9.12.  The expected delivery date was for Thursday 3.15.12 - Monday 3.20.12. The needles got here on Wednesday 3.14.12, So it was exciting to get them a day early!  I got them because one of my close friends has been wanting her lip and ears pierced for cheap. After reading reviews and looking at prices, I decided that these would probably be the best choice. I was totally correct. I used to do my own piercings with sewing needles (dumb idea when you can get 5 sterilized piercing needles for like 2 dollars).  So, I decided to buy 2 packs (10 needles). I used one as soon as they arrived, just to see if they went in as smoothly as everyone said. And they most definately did. I pierced my cartilage on my own, it was sooooooooo incredibly easy! I was honestly surprised at how easy and painless it was compared to a sewing needle haha. They came individually packaged, and sterelized, just as described. They were extremely sharp, which was really good. All in all. these are great, cheap, sharp piercing needles and I would definately recommend them to anyone and everyone. Very good product and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I&#x27;ll definately be buying again (:</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews, I ordered 2 (5 packs) and I&#x27;m excitedly waiting for them to arrive :) I also ordered a 16 gauge piercing kit from a different seller which gave me a labret ring, forceps, corkscrew, gloves, alcohol preps everything I needed to pierce my tragus. So if your really into piercings you should check it out.</li>
    <li> Excellent they worked fine no infection and no smell or taste or blood. They made me sexy and horney all times</li>
    <li> The needles were sterilized just as expected, unfortunatly i ordered the wrong size! If you are piercing your lip and have a 16g ring BUY a 14g Needle!! If you buy a 16g needle you&#x27;ll need a 18g ring!</li>
    <li> Took a little bit to come in the mail, but the quality was worth it. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> These came in early (on Christmas day, no less). They&#x27;re sharp, clean, and really professionally packaged. I literally just used the first one about an hour or so ago. Piercing my septum was no problem. Hardly any pain (though tenderness has naturally followed).   Only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the length. They&#x27;re short, but I wasn&#x27;t comfortable pushing three inches of steel all the way through my nose. I pulled it back through. The jewelry went right in, so it wasn&#x27;t really an issue, but I had been hoping to just slide it all in seamlessly.   I recommend this, 100%!</li>
    <li> They worked beautifully for piercing my ears. A standard sized earring post fits in the needle perfectly for easy insertion of the earring into the newly pierced hole. Quick, easy, and no infection!</li>
    <li> Very sharp and easy to use; however it took 44 days to arrive</li>
    <li> Sharp, strong, and clean. All you really need, wish I did all of my own piercings, cheap and simple! Would recommend to anyone who wants a piercing.</li>
    <li> These needles arrived extremely quickly. So quickly that I had to sit on my hands for 2 days waiting for my jewelry to arrive from a different company (ordered on the same day). These needles are sterile and so incredibly sharp that they glide right through causing no tissue trauma. Which means I experienced no bleeding or swelling when I re-pierced my lip after not wearing anything in it for 3 years. 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are really sharp and go through super easy. If you are looking for good piercing needles that work and have quick shipping, get these!</li>
    <li> I first used one to pierce my earlobe, and I hardly felt it. I will use these to do any future piercings. They went through smoothly and made a clean hole. It was easy to insert the jewelry. They came seperately packaged and were were sanitary. The shipping was also super fast. Definitely five stars!</li>
    <li> Quick service,good quality product, quick, precise communication. Overall an excellent purchase and buying experience , will use again in the future.</li>
    <li> They do their job. They arrived on time. Nicely packaged. I enjoy them. I love having the freedom to pierce whatever I like.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Came in autoclave packages. Went through cleanly and easily, minimal pain, no blood. Exactly the right size (16g barbell external threading fit into the back and followed through without any issue).</li>
    <li> I got my needles about two/three days after I bought it, It was very easy to pierce with. Best needles I&#x27;ve ever used. Sterilized very well, no infections. I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all. Actully thinking about buying another pack..</li>
    <li> These Sterilized Piercing Needles come in individual packaging and are small and sharp enough to be relativity painless. The needles are hollow with the sharpened end cut on angle to ease the piercing. I used these for lancing a painful abscess caused by an ongoing medical condition and these worked as well as the ones used by my doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> Did the job! Got a clean hole straight through my septum fast! They were really sharp, and I got zero infections, and actually minimal to zero bleeding! Although I don&#x27;t recommend use if you aren&#x27;t a professional, with clean hands, and sea salt soaks, this is way better than using a nastly safety pin or sewing needle...</li>
    <li> Purchased a few other sizes from another seller, these are quality needles as well.&lt;br /&gt;No infections, sealed, and they are the size I asked for. Used them all up already, will probably be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Great needles- these are perfect size for a standard earring to fit through so it&#x27;s very very easy and they are so painless. I pierced 8 holes with these on 3 different people without pain. Shipping takes awhile but it&#x27;s also free. Would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Back in my rebel days I had 6 piercings that over time I let close. Recently I decided that I wanted to re-pierce one of my cartilage piercings but I didn&#x27;t want to go pay another $60 to have it done... so I bought these needles and did it myself! For me, it was just a matter of directing the needle through the already existing hole in the cartilage which was a snap! Overall, I&#x27;m glad that I could wear my earring again without having to pay too much money!</li>
    <li> I expected it to come with just 5 needles. But it came with 25. Used one to pierce my ear. Works just like any other piercing needle. Good quality, and cheap.</li>
    <li> Though a small order, these sterilized needles were just what I needed.  They were packaged well and worked beautifully.  Many thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> very good, its sealed in some kind of sterilizing stuff, I ordered the wrong size so I had trouble putting the jewelry through but nothing wrong with this product</li>
    <li> nice this was dope and great and dope dope dope dope dope i like this ish mane ima get me some piercings</li>
    <li> Loved them! Cheap and sharp. Periced my lip with them. was so nervous (scared of needles) the needle was already through my lip and I didn&#x27;t even know it.</li>
    <li> They are amazing. They came in earlier than expected, and I just pierced my tongue web with the needles last night and it went straight in with no problem. Will definitely be buying from them again</li>
    <li> I started doing my own piercings after doing some research.  These were great, sterilized &amp; super sharp, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting them through skin or cartilage.</li>
    <li> I will purchase these needles over and over again. I pierced my ears and navel with them. It&#x27;s time for more since I use one per piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to order make sure that your earring and needle are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12g&lt;br /&gt;14g&lt;br /&gt;16g&lt;br /&gt;Etc</li>
    <li> These shipped so quickly! I pierced my sister&#x27;s ears with these and they were great. The tip was so fine that it went right through...</li>
    <li> Not the manufacturer problems ,teenager did it without my approval ,so i can&#x27;t really comment positively about it but he used it</li>
    <li> Holy shit cx I got a lot more than I thought it was, I thkught it was 5 needles but It was 5 packs which has 5 needles each xD I felt so stupid cx But I ended up using them all almost and They work really really well, they&#x27;re really sharp and They go in like nothing :3 They&#x27;re awesome.</li>
    <li> I ordered these 1/29/14, the date it was supposed to come in was 2/3/14, now it is 2/10/14 and i am not able to see any tracking information. I do not know if there was a problem with delivering or what, but i am sort of disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no professional, but I would say these don&#x27;t seem to be 16 gauge. I used them to re-pierce my nostril, and the needle was the exact size as the 18g ring I put in. Needless to say, be prepared if you plan on piercing any flesh with these as your ring might not fit in the end to glide through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise they were VERY sharp, and sterile.</li>
    <li> clean, inexpensive, and perfect.</li>
    <li> just what i needed. very sharp, and my piercing didnt hurt as much as when i did it with a sewing needle(which is a stupid idea, dont do that)</li>
    <li> These needles are great and they came so fast in the mail I&#x27;m definitely buyer more &amp;#60;3 Thanks</li>
    <li> Individually packed &amp; easy to use if you wanna get pierced very good product you need this in your life</li>
    <li> very sharp, so it hurts less and creates a clean hole. i love them and am very satisfied with my piercings:)  i would definitely recomend these for ear piercings, as well as other piercings.</li>
    <li> These are 100% sterilized needles the&#x27;re good asf</li>
    <li> they did pierce through, but not a good size for any type or thick piercing like a belly button ring.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and sterile needles that did exactly what I intended them to do. Pierced my ears myself and they went in quite easily.</li>
    <li> I like these because they are individually wrapped. They also work well</li>
    <li> I was so excited to recieve my piercing needles and they came in the mail must faster then I expected. I was so shocked to to find not just 5 needles, but 25!! Thank you so much! I can&#x27;t wait to pierce my septum!</li>
    <li> The needles did their job and they were quite affordable. I used them to get my septum pierced and it worked!</li>
    <li> Not the most charming review im ever going to write I&#x27;ll be honest ;p but anyway, my piercer boyfriend says these get the job done, and the hole they put in my lip is awesome. XD</li>
    <li> Just arrived today, 5 weeks after order placement, so that was a bit of a wait..&lt;br /&gt;They were an 18 gauge, not 16, so might want to order a size up?&lt;br /&gt;Also not as sharp as I had hoped, had a bit of trouble breaking through the other end of the skin. Came with 25 needles though! So l wouldn&#x27;t say it was a terrible buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of needles to work with&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was pretty drawn out&lt;br /&gt;Size too small</li>
    <li> Came before estimated date with more than advertised! Thank you very much! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Absolute garbage - I had to force them so hard into my ear and they still didn&#x27;t go all the way through. Do not buy - they&#x27;re garbage. Not worth the wait; no wonder they&#x27;re so cheap.</li>
    <li> They were good but the only thing is that they didn&#x27;t come in the box as pictured. Just wrapped up in bubble wrap</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp so they went through quickly, easily and virtually painlessly. I&#x27;ve had the cartilage in my ears pierced before and these needles hurt less than the one I had professionally. I Loved them and will definitely buy more. Seller was great also, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I used these to pierce a friend&#x27;s ears and they worked great!  I love how they were individually packaged and how great the price was.  If I ever need more I will definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> Super sharp. Went through before I even knew what happened, with very minimal pain. Yes, I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> These were super sharp and shipping was soo fast. I piercing my ears and it when threw my cartilage no problem. I&#x27;m going to be buying again.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong size for my belly button and didn&#x27;t realize that I ordered the wrong size til the needle was already in my belly button but it was painless! I reccomend these!</li>
    <li> Title explains it all. I was not happy with the puncturing ability. I really had to force it in there. Definitely not as effortless as the professionals.</li>
    <li> These were great it went in like butter but the stud same gauge did not fit in the end to fallow through so that was a lil difficult.. other than that it went in good i love it</li>
    <li> These are NOT accurately 16 gauge, they are closer to 17 gauge (smaller). I measured them with a high precision caliper and they are 1.19 mm. 16 gauge should be 1.29 mm. I can&#x27;t use them at all because I was counting on the gauge for precision mechanical assembly, not piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took over 2 weeks to get them. At least they came sooner than the &#x27;expected&#x27; delivery, which was marked as anywhere from 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the &#x27;positive&#x27; side, they are extremely sharp. I pricked myself trying to get one out of its package. Barely touched it and it drew blood. Good thing they are sterile, or at least I hope so.</li>
    <li> Great and really sharp.. might order more</li>
    <li> I bought these needles to pierce my septum myself and it came out awesome! It was so sharp and the pain was quick. I ended up piercing my friends tragus the same day. The shipping was fast and I will be purchasing from this seller in the future! ^.^</li>
    <li> My friend pierced my triple forward helix using these, cork, alcohol,  nontoxic marker, and regular studs. I pierced her tragus, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the exact size I asked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are super sharp and each needle is singlely packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend watching a few youtube videos on what you want pierced and a top ten mistakes of at home piercings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these came 2 days before the estimated delivery period even began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I will never NEVER but again! The gauge size was more like a 20. very sad..</li>
    <li> They worked amazingly.</li>
    <li> Great needles, But MIGHT drag and be a pain when not lubed. :) By all means, Use unlubed but only if you&#x27;re a bit of a trooper. Otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend something to help it slide through easier. Also, The ending is SLIGHTLY too small to follow through correctly when using 16g jewelry but despite this I DO NOT recommend using a gauge bigger than your jewelry size.</li>
    <li> I do condone doing anything urself . But if u r going to . Thease  r vary sharp and will slide right threw . Make sure u clean them agen  to make sure there clean . Does the job grate but research what ur doing and how to first !</li>
    <li> I have had my lip pierced by professionals over 3 times, spending 50-80 dollars on the each piercing, depending on how trendy the place was (Infinite Body Piercing, Philadelphia, PA to a local hole in Trevose, PA and Body Graphics in Pennsauken, NJ)to just getting the job done.  My body rejected it every time, but my mind rejected the rejection.  I&#x27;ve been getting piercings done for about 15 years.  Not only do I like the look, but enjoy the excitement and a little bit of pain.  What I don&#x27;t enjoy is the price.  So, to be honest, I did enjoy getting my lip redone 3 times in a time span of 1 year.  Due to having Lyme Disease, I figured that my lip would heal much better b/c I&#x27;m on antibiotics 24 hrs day/7 days/week.  I ordered the 16 gauge needles, the forceps as wells as a lip ring that gave me plenty of room for my lip to swell (which was one of the issues the other pierces&#x27; never did and the back of the ring would push through my lip, creating a horrible sore.    All the items I received came in surgical conditions, clean, packaged and covered in away that a doctor would be proud.  All I needed were gloves,a quality mouth wash, numbing agent, and alcohol pads, which I already had.  The entire cost of my piercing endevour was less than 20 dollars and a ton of excitement and pride.  I did a better job than the best of the best at Infinite in Philly.  I couldn&#x27;t have done it without this seller.  I suggest to anyone who does this regularly to trust this seller, and continue to purchase from them.  The needles are the sharpest ever, that I couldn&#x27;t even feel it, and I was doing it myself, totally sober and drug free. (No one should ever do that to themselves without full consciousness).  I not only saved money, but defaced my body ( as my mother puts it,even though I&#x27;m 35), and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ll be defacing more of it as winter comes and more purchases will be made.  5 STARS FOR YOU</li>
    <li> I purchased this almost a month ago. I know it says that the shipping was supposed to take a while, but they charged me for it and, according to the tracking, it still hasn&#x27;t been shipped out. I&#x27;ll see about adding a &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;no good&#x27; to this review when I actually get it in.</li>
    <li> I love these needles!! I will most definatly buy again if I ever need more! Painless, slides right in fast, very sharp and comfortable!! I recommend these needles!!</li>
    <li> Very Sharp! I have my ear peirced 2 times so far. Neither of the times did they hurt. Very Fast mailing! All in all Very Satisfied.</li>
    <li> came in the mail fast, everything was brand new and sealed like it should be. Very good product for who cheap!</li>
    <li> We used these to pierce my best friends septum and might I say it worked out great. She said that when the needle went through it was painless, and getting the jewelry in was painless as well (18G Jewelry). The product came exactly as said and we still have more needles to spare. Highly recommend for a household job, much cheaper than getting it done at a shop, but make sure you have the proper equipment (i.e. Clamps, Sterilizing pads, Gloves, Jewelry SMALLER than the gauge of needle bought).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Kids chose this product to do a nose piercing. They were glad for this package of needles and I didn&#x27;t hear any complaints other than going a little too far with the needle. Go figure!</li>
    <li> These needles arrived quickly after ordering and were accurately described.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re individually wrapped and each one has the date packaged and how long until it expires. The needles are sharp and pierce skin very easily with minimal pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is they do not come as shown in the photo, they come in an envelope with the individually packaged needles in one larger plastic bag.</li>
    <li> They came in the mail exactly when they were supposed to. Because of the price, I was expecting very cheap, low-grade needles, but to my surprise, these needles are legit, sterile, medical-grade needles! What a steal for a little over $2! They&#x27;re very sharp, and they come with a hard plastic sleeve over the end of the needle, so that made me confident about storing them. I used one to pierce my cousins lip, and it slid right through with ease, she barely felt a thing. I will definitely be using the rest of the needles for more piercings.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I ordered these needles just to see the quality of these needles that were going for such low rates! Long story short I fell in love with the customer service. My packaged was delayed 1 day of shipping because of weather related issues and the guys at this company contacted me immediately to make sure I knew protocol! Loved it</li>
    <li> These needles were very sharp &amp; it didn&#x27;t hurt on bit to pierce my septum.&lt;br /&gt;I love that they came individually wrapped with the date they were sterilized &amp; when they expire.&lt;br /&gt;I used clamps &amp; its perfectly straight. I love my new piercing. I definitely recommend these needle to anyone &amp; everyone!</li>
    <li> ordered this in April, it is now September and still haven&#x27;t gotten it. I wrote to the seller and have gotten no reply. Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re time or money on this one.</li>
    <li> It went in quick, easy, no blood, and it came to my house BEFORE the date set to be here. I am so glad that I had this in mind. I do not prefer you do a home piercing, but if you do, use these needles.</li>
    <li> Perfect. And nicely packaged in there on single slot. Which is great for steral process. Work great. Dont break which is a plus</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend because she wanted to pierce her own nose. They came ready to go, and sterilized in the package. Worked like a charm. Now she has a cute nose piercing. Great needles.</li>
    <li> were perfect to pierce</li>
    <li> went through the skin like good sharp needle</li>
    <li> I accidently bought the wrong needles to pierce my tounge when i needed 14g needles,but it worked out fine &amp; went through easily.</li>
    <li> 5, 16 gauge, sterilized needles&lt;br /&gt;just as ad says&lt;br /&gt;5 star rating :D&lt;br /&gt;i recommend to piercers and anyone with training</li>
    <li> these are great for those who like to do their own piercings or need to gauge up their piercings. Theyre really sharp and since i only used them on myself and boyfriend i used each a good couple of times n they were still pretty sharp. :D</li>
    <li> This product came on time very quickly even though I happened to be out and missed the delivery man but I got it and was very satisfied. The product came in an envelope which threw me off because I pictured it coming in a box but I guess since it was only 5 needles that it made sense. I already have had wonderful succsess with all my piercings using these needles.</li>
    <li> Omg I used this last night to repierce one of my ears.  It did not hurt one bit !  In fact I didn&#x27;t even know when I had actually gone through my ear!  Very happy !</li>
    <li> I bought these to pierce my cartilage with the help of a friend (who knows what they&#x27;re doing). They come individually wrapped in sterilized packaging, they&#x27;re hollow (how a piercing needle should be), and are good and sharp. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Went right through, painlessly.</li>
    <li> these are perfect, went right through and did not hurt at all.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! everything was sterile, and the needles were straight as can be! worked great! i loved it!</li>
    <li> JK .... I like it!  . . . .. . . .. . . . . . . .. . . .</li>
    <li> the needles are thick if you expect thin&lt;br /&gt;quality is not good some points are bended and couldn&#x27;t be used\&lt;br /&gt;some are ok</li>
    <li> These needles are great! i ordered them on a friday and they came in on monday! i used one to pierce my smiley and it went through smooth and painlessly. the next day i pierced my best friends septum, she also said she ddidnt feel much. the packaging was discreet which was great.&lt;br /&gt;but just remember to have the right size jewlery for the needle. these are 16g so remember youll need 18g!&lt;br /&gt;(:</li>
    <li> Wow what can i say, these get the job done. I pierced my lip with these and it went threw like better. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping and great quality</li>
    <li> I went on quite a lengthy search to find needles I thought would work the best for piercing... I decided on these. And AM SO GLAD I did... they worked GREAT. They all came individually packaged (sterile, thank goodness), and the point was protected. I double- pierced my own ears with them, as well as my cartilage. It was ALMOST pain-free. :) Then all of a sudden all my friends wanted their ears pierced too... it was that easy. I had no idea what gauge to get, but these I&#x27;m assuming are standard size, as my earrings fit perfectly in the back.&lt;br /&gt;I was a newbie, so for anyone wondering how exactly to do it, I can quick explain: you simply put the earring in the back of the hollow needle, stab your ear, pull the needle through, and when the needle comes completely out the back- the piercing will be in your ear. and PLEASE please use a high quality earring, gold or sterling silver is a MUST... NOT a cheap earring (my friend used a cheap couple-dollar set of earrings and it became infected- the metal is just not good quality, and should never be used as a first piercing).&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended not to pierce my ears myself... but I didn&#x27;t want to pay to have it done. I&#x27;m glad I did it this way- but please know what you&#x27;re doing. I was very careful, had everything sanitized, and cleaned my ears twice a day for 2 weeks afterwards. My friends, who used cheap earrings or didn&#x27;t clean their ears afterwards consistantly, got infected and ended up having to take their piercings out. It&#x27;s NOT about the initial piercing, it&#x27;s about how you do it and take care of it afterwards. Now it&#x27;s been 6 months, mine are obviously completely healed, and I&#x27;m glad I chose to do them myself :) (though if you&#x27;re a bit squeemish- have a friend do it. It can feel slightly masochistic to pull the thing through your own ear... ha)&lt;br /&gt;So... these needles are great! If I&#x27;ll pierce anything else, I&#x27;ll buy these again!</li>
    <li> They came late. I wasn&#x27;t surprised since they come from so far away. But I got what I wanted and more. It was actually more than 5 lines of needles which was awesome. I used them to give myself 3 lobe piercings (well 6 since it was 3 on each ear). They are very sharp, punctured my skin without any trouble. They should not to be reused, that is why you get so many.</li>
    <li> I had my girlfriend pierce my ears (It was my first time) and these worked great. She also did another hole on her own ear. I&#x27;ve pierced ears before and these worked a lot better an the other brand I used. It&#x27;s a very fair price for 5 needles. I have two left for whatever else I may do.</li>
    <li> I really liked these but only ended up using one of them... I used to have a cartilage piercing that would occasionally need to be re pierced if I took the earrings out for too long, but eventually it just got to be a pain and I took it out for good. I had big plans for these to do another piercing farther down my ear but was dissuaded by the fact that my upper one just never seemed to completely heal.. I had it for yearss.. at least 5, but it would still act up and feel infected if I went too long without cleaning it. I just got sick of it and decided to just keep my regular piercings on my ear lobes. Ah well.. For what I wanted them for these needles were excellent though and the price was really good : )</li>
    <li> these needles are absolutely great they are like little knives and packaged in a way that would make a doctor proud</li>
    <li> These got here early, they are great for self piercing as they are very sharp and provide little pain. They were sealed safely. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This item was great it was my first time buying these they were clean and nicely sent I was happy with this item.</li>
    <li> When I order these they were expected to come between the 20th and the 25th. However, they arrived a day early! I was very happy. They came and good shape in sterile packaging. Very pleased. I recommend this to anyone wanting to get them.</li>
    <li> Not too cheap, good quality; if used properly these bad boys are the perfect tool to get the job done. Loved them, and so happy to be able to buy a small 5pack for personal/at-home piercings instead of buying a huge box of them. THANKS!</li>
    <li> Well, the needles are too small in diameter. Other than that these are good needles. I would recommend these to everyone, but be warned they are kinda small.</li>
    <li> This needle slid through my forward helix with hardly any pressure and was half way through the cork before I realized it. I didn&#x27;t feel a thing as it went through so fast. I was using a smaller cork and it was a split second pierce. No pull, drag, or pressure was felt. I have a few &amp;#34;pro piercings&amp;#34; and this needle seemed to be sharper. Not recommending home piercing of course due to infection risk etc, but this was my choice and would buy again!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased these needles so I could pierce my ear. They worked perfect. Fast shipping. Each needle can individually packaged, which was nice. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great service and fast shipping , needles are sterile will buy again ;-) Already have Monroe pierced, but have a tendency to take it out and want it pierced again. Now I have the supplies I need to re-pierce if needed! THANKS</li>
    <li> These reviews look soo great! I just bought it and waiting for it to come! I&#x27;m planning to pierce my Conch!! Boy I hope these won&#x27;t hurt!!</li>
    <li> These were perfect! I received a great product that even came two weeks early and they gave me 25 needles which I probably won&#x27;t use all of, but extras are always nice!</li>
    <li> They were nicely packaged and look very sharp cant wait to pierce my cartilage!</li>
    <li> Three out of five of the packages came broken and opened in the mail. You cnt pierce anything safely with an unsterilized needle.</li>
    <li> This needle really helped me pierce my septum. It was really amazing and I&#x27;m thinking about piercing my lip next. Thanks</li>
    <li> its what you want in a needle. new. clean. sharp. packaged.&lt;br /&gt;i loved the piercing needles and the piercings ive done :)</li>
    <li> I used these piercing needles to pierce my nose and they were phenomenal. I had no problems and I had lots to spare for future piercings. There needles were sharp and go through your skin like butter---I didn&#x27;t feel a thing. :) Thanks!</li>
    <li> The needles I received came earlier than expected and were clean and sharp and all the things you&#x27;d hope sterile hollow needles should be.</li>
    <li> They worked great, but I couldn&#x27;t fit my 16G lip ring into the hole on the end of the needle. Measured them &amp; found out they&#x27;re only 14G! They work great, just labeled wrong!</li>
    <li> Not really sharp. It hurts and takes longer than my other piercings.</li>
    <li> Cheap Chinese needles (had simplified Chinese characters and &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34; written all over the packs) were not 16 gauge- they were hollow but not large enough to drop a 16g stud into. Would not recommend anyone buy or use these.</li>
    <li> Products was exactly as described and came in quickly. Needles were also individually packaged and each needle had a plastic covering the tip. Did the job quite well.</li>
    <li> They came totally early, the packaging was sterile and I appreciate that! They were also the same size as I ordered, which was also awesome. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I used these needles to pierce some cartilage and nose piercings and the gauge was accurate. They were sterile as far as I could see, but I still re-disinfected them. xoxo</li>
    <li> As always... Great! Second time purchasing and happy as ever!</li>
    <li> got here on time..The product was what i expected.Im a satisfied customer.and will be a returning customer..i do recommend them to others..</li>
    <li> Used these for self piercings, obviously. Haha, but they go through ears and cartilage like butter!!! Buy these seriously! now!</li>
    <li> Very sharp &amp; work great!</li>
    <li> It was very easy to pierce the skin with these!!  nicely packaged and sharp as heck! my angel bites came out clean !</li>
    <li> Bought these to self pierce my tongue web and my tragus. These needles are great! They are packaged separately and in sterile sealed baggies. Would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I used them to pierce my nipple and they are sterile, sharp so a lot less pain And cheap. I got the 5 pack because of the price</li>
    <li> Very good surprised to find 5 packs and instead of 1 so now I have 25 needles !</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
    <li> i jst recieve my needles today an i wasnt suppose to get them til tommorow but idc im happy lol ive been want to pierce my right lobe an trague lol hope the jewlz fit in the hole im sick an i took sum pills an im buzzin hope i dnt miss lmao but ill be buying these now on ill probly be getting the 14 g&#x27;s nxt time</li>
    <li> I do not promote self piercing unless you are a piercer or apprentice, however, I know many people will do it themselves. These needles are very sharp, sterile &amp; glide right thru the skin. Great price for 5 piercing needles. If you must do it yourself, use these. Great seller, will definitely shop with again!!</li>
    <li> it was fast shipment and exactly what I needed. I used it to re-pierce my monroe and it worked perfect!</li>
    <li> These are incredibly sharp and work wonderfully. The back might not be the side you want to get an earring through, but this is the 16g size, and yes, it is accurate. I used 16g earrings after piercing with this, and it was the perfect size. Amazing value for the quality of the product. They ship quickly and are individually packaged and sterilized.</li>
    <li> they turned out to be 18 gauge not 16 gauge but oher wise okay they did do the job needed but had to force 16 gauge earing in to make it fit</li>
    <li> Exactly what&#x27;s described. Very sharp. Great product.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, good packaging. Haven&#x27;t used the needles yet but they are each in a separate steril pouch marked with sterilization date and expiration date. Interesting note each needle was capped with plastic inside the pouch.  The bevels looks very clean and sharp and the needle shaft looks very well machined. I would recommend these to anyone looking to pierce themselves who will be responsible about steril environment. Very good seller.</li>
    <li> Perfect. The needles were very sharp and got the job done. They were used to pierce hand web, ears, and septum and got the job done each time smoothly. Would definitely buy again. Also they shipped quickly and were packaged well.</li>
    <li> They arrived earlier than expected,but I couldn&#x27;t be happier :) none were broken or damaged which is great. They&#x27;re very sharp and make piercing the skin easy. Love them &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I was working with a hole that had slightly closed and the product that I received was not sharp enough to pierce the skin. I finally just use a sewing needle to reopen the hole.</li>
    <li> Needle went right through my septum very smoothly, very sharp and I would reccomend these for nearly any at home piercing.</li>
</ol>
