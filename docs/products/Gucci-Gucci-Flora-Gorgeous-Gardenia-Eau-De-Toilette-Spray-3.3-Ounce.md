      <li>The scent is light and airy and very feminine!</li>

      <li>I really like this perfume which smells light and flora</li>

<li> Very light/insignificant  smell,much different than when tested at Department store...</li>
<li> But it doesn&#x27;t last long on the skin, so Im unsatisfied about that.</li>
<li> It doesnt last very long</li>
<li> The only complaint I have about this is that it does not come in an atomizer - which would make putting it on much easier for me.</li>
<li> Sad as well because I really like that perfume and thats why I ordered a larger bottle.</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical at first it if was a fake and someone was trying to make extra money for marketing it as the real deal.</li>
<li> I liked Chanel&#x27;s Gardenia until it became impossible to find and got to be too expensive as a daily perfume.</li>
<li> and I could kick myself in the a*s, I spent a little over $100 on it...</li>
<li> and.only lasted 2 hours on my skin, fake product very unsatisfied.</li>
<li> I am always afraid that I will loose my grip on an open bottle of perfume (such as this) and spill it all over the rug or counter...</li>
<li> but Amazon had it priced significantly less!</li>
<li> and I usually apply it in the morning and again at my lunch break at work.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s not lasting very disappointed especially paying $65</li>
<li> I tend to like subtle floral fragrances</li>
<li> Though it is expensive, this is the very same perfume that I have bought at the mall at the expensive counters.  </li>
<li> Too bad.</li>

    <li> Better priced, quick and my wife favorite. ..</li>
    <li> I received this perfume as a test sample from Buzzagent and I love it! The scent is light and airy and very feminine! My husband loves the way I smell when I wear this! The only complaint I have about this is that it does not come in an atomizer - which would make putting it on much easier for me. I am always afraid that I will loose my grip on an open bottle of perfume (such as this) and spill it all over the rug or counter... However, this is easily rectified by purchasing an inexpensive atomizer and transferring the contents into that!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday present and she loved it. This is a good perfume and a great present.</li>
    <li> My new favorite! Light and pretty in a beautiful bottle. And I put some in a roll-on bottle so I can take it with me in my purse.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a Christmas gift for my GF.  She LOVES the Gucci Flora GG.  I think it smells amazing as well</li>
    <li> I liked Chanel&#x27;s Gardenia until it became impossible to find and got to be too expensive as a daily perfume. I like this version of gardenia, flowery or not overly so. I have had nothing but compliments. I ordered it from Amazon because the department stores wasn&#x27;t carrying it any more. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Bought for my grand-daughter for Xmas Gift, she loves it and used it immediatly.  It was the best price anywhere and I did check all over.</li>
    <li> this was a Christmas gift and they loved the it. thank for making shopping easy. Gucci has wonderful products no many the occasion.</li>

    <li> Very light/insignificant  smell,much different than when tested at Department store... that explains the difference in price...&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware - I would like to return this product but amazon does not give you the option.</li>
    <li> Gucci is a name that you can depend on ......... and in this case, it makes Nancy feel a lot more presentable wearing it !&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I don´t have a problem with that&amp;#34; ..... says Bill ...... her husband !!!</li>
    <li> The wife loves this fragrance, and she smells great wearing it!</li>
    <li> smelled it at macys and.it.lasted me all day until night, sprayed.this one and.only lasted 2 hours on my skin, fake product very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> Smells good and the flavor is light . I like light flavor …</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. But it&#x27;s not lasting very disappointed especially paying $65</li>
    <li> I love it! It is exactly what I asked for and way better also in my price range. Def buying all my perfumes on here from now on &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Item just as described fast shipping. Will shop again.</li>
    <li> Surprised my girlfriend with this and she loves it. I Love the smell of it. Came undamaged and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I found this orginially in a Gucci store in Japan so obviously I could not afford to buy it there. I gave it a shot and found it on Amazon and decided to buy it. I was a little skeptical at first it if was a fake and someone was trying to make extra money for marketing it as the real deal. But i got it and it smells just like the one in the store. It doesnt last very long and I usually apply it in the morning and again at my lunch break at work. But I think it smells great , just like gardenia.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter - who really liked the light floral scent. She loves this toilette.  I also liked this scent.  I also tried their Magnolia spray and loved that scent.  I have never purchased Gucci Eau de Toilette before, but after this purchase, I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Though it is expensive, this is the very same perfume that I have bought at the mall at the expensive counters.  It was in the original wrapping and it had the cellophane still around it. I had a bottle that was bought at the mall and compared the two, they are exactly the same.  I don&#x27;t know the cost everywhere and if you have the time to get out in the traffic and craziness to get to the mall it might be better for you to get it that way, but for me, I am very busy and I knew I liked this scent.  It is my husbands favorite.  It is light and pretty but not too flowery or sweet.  A very beautiful scent, as expected by Gucci.</li>
    <li> Same perfume but better price than in the stores. I was happy with the purchase.  I really  love the scent.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume which smells light and flora, this is just what I love. Thanks for providing this with better price.</li>
    <li> Good product,  received on time</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend this product...puts me in a great mood everyday! Plus the compliments from people are nice too :). You must try it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. When I heard the name &#x27;gardenia&#x27; I figured I wouldn&#x27;t like it, believing it would be a strong floral scent which I do not care for but instead, it&#x27;s the right amount of sweet yet a slight hint of spice. I was looking and looking for the perfect perfume for months. I didn&#x27;t want to settle. But I found this and immediately fell in love. Even better, department stores had this priced at $72 but Amazon had it priced significantly less!</li>
    <li> This is my current favorite perfume.  I tend to like subtle floral fragrances so this is just right for me.  Got a great price compared to department stores!</li>
    <li> Lovely floral fragrance!</li>
    <li> I have somehow made it 30 years without ever wearing a fragrance. They all seemed too cloying or floral or... I don&#x27;t know, like old people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is super light, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling too strongly or putting on too much. It&#x27;s all I would ever consider wearing as far as perfume is concerned.</li>
    <li> So gad that this came in 2 days (thanks Prime!) and that it saved me almost $50 from dept store prices! Love the scent, it lasts a while, is strong, and unique.</li>
