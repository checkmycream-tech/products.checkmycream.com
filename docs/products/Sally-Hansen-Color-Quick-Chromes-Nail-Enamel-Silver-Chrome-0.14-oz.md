      <li>The polish dries extremely fast and does not seem to chip super easily.</li>
      <li>but when dry it did not look good at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not as easy and fast to paint your nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are easy to use, accurate without getting much polish on your skin, and fast drying for when you might be on the go.</li>
      <li>The chrome color is pretty cool too, and the brush gives nailpaints perfection.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Silver Chrome and the color is vibrant, bright and solid after two coats.</li>
      <li>I have a few of these pens in different colors, and let me tell you, awesome.</li>
      <li>It does dry fast as stated and it very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>and Im amazed on how fast it dryes really recommend it!</li>
      <li>I was hoping that it would look exactly like the picture on the box and come out really shiny.</li>
      <li>Color isn&#x27;t very opaque.</li>
      <li>Touching up does not really look</li>
      <li>I really like this polish.</li>
      <li>And it dries really fast as well.</li>
      <li>and I must have a different definition of \\&quot;quick dry\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a high shine.</li>
      <li>I bought it just to see how it would work, but I would stick to normal nail polish in the bottle.</li>
      <li>keep coming up with new things for nails</li>
      <li>The applicator is really easy to use, though I am concerned that the brush head will dry out and not be usable next time I use it since it is not kept in the nail polish solution.</li>
      <li>I thought, \\&quot;wow chrome, that looks</li>
      <li>The chrome colors are so different, and classy, and I am not a teenager.  </li>
      <li>I have used it several times, and the brush has not dried out yet.</li>
      <li>I normally have shaky hands when I use regular nail polish, but since I could hold this like a pen it made it easier to apply without as big if a mess around the edges to clean up.</li>

    <li> I was looking for some interesting nail polish colors today and I saw this. I thought, \\&quot;wow chrome, that looks neat\\&quot;, so I got it. I was hoping that it would look exactly like the picture on the box and come out really shiny. It isn&#x27;t as shiny as the picture, kind of like the luster of aluminum that isn&#x27;t really polished, but I think it looks great. The applicator is really easy to use, though I am concerned that the brush head will dry out and not be usable next time I use it since it is not kept in the nail polish solution. It also dries and sets really fast, I couldn&#x27;t make a dent in it with my nail just a few minutes after application. I thought I would need at least two coats, but after one coat it is opaque. I really love it.</li>
    <li> I recently have gotten into nail designs.  I have a few of these pens in different colors, and let me tell you, awesome.I love the fact that because it&#x27;s a pen, it&#x27;s easy to apply, the brush itself is pretty good, and it dries....quick!  I use the grey often as a base color.  If anything, I&#x27;ll always have the silver chrome as part of my colloction.</li>
    <li> I got this product,thinking it would be easy to use on the go. I was correct! The polish dries so quickly and is so easy to apply. I have used it several times, and the brush has not dried out yet. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My wife thinks its great</li>
    <li> I like the color. However, it goes on clumpy. I think the color has dried out somewhat. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to add some polish thinner so it applies more smoothly.</li>
    <li> Nice color.  Easy to use and dries quickly.  Good for pedicures. Seals well.  I&#x27;m going to try other colors. Happy.</li>
    <li> Clumpy and messy - disappointed</li>
    <li> Bought this for stamping. Love how quickly it dries. The silver is a good but slightly dull silver that&#x27;s perfect with a shiny topcoat or sparkles. The brush damages very easily. It&#x27;s no good as a nail polish brush but it&#x27;s perfect for stamping.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long and it&#x27;s not as easy and fast to paint your nails.&lt;br /&gt;it was a nice try, but i wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again.</li>

    <li> i use this as a stamping polish works great the polish is not hard on my nails either. love it</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I thought it would save time. The brush is unacceptable, it gets all over the place and I must have a different definition of \\&quot;quick dry\\&quot;. It is, however, quick to get gummy and stay that way for hours. It looks cheap. Mine went into the trash after one use. Save your money</li>
    <li> Super easy to apply! It doesn&#x27;t seem like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; nail polish liquid though, but that may be because I bought a metallic color? I&#x27;d purchase another because the ease of application.</li>
    <li> These nailpolish pens are great!  They are easy to use, accurate without getting much polish on your skin, and fast drying for when you might be on the go.</li>
    <li> Brush is a bit cumbersome and stiff. After about 10-12 clicks the product begins to dispense. Color isn&#x27;t very opaque. Took about 3 coats to get opacity. Doesn&#x27;t have a high shine. Possibly great for touch ups vs. full application.</li>
    <li> these are so cool to work with! hope sally comesout with more colors. delivery was very quick  thank you  keep coming up with new things for nails</li>
    <li> It does dry fast as stated and it very easy to apply.  Chips very easy so I have to touch up daily.  Touching up does not really look that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived earlier then promised.</li>
    <li> The polish dries extremely fast and does not seem to chip super easily. Great for someone who needs a quick way to polish their nails.</li>
    <li> I really liked how the color just glides on and Im amazed on how fast it dryes really recommend it!</li>
    <li> It took many shake to get any polish to come out then I put it on but when dry it did not look good at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the color at all</li>
    <li> The product applies weirdly. It is easy to apply, but it leaves a lot of streaks that you have to go over with more coats. I bought it just to see how it would work, but I would stick to normal nail polish in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Silver Chrome and the color is vibrant, bright and solid after two coats. However, the brush on this looks like the end of a frayed rope!  It&#x27;s very coarse and uneven leading to rough edges. I&#x27;m disappointed that it can&#x27;t paint a nail as intended without looking sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll still be using it when striping or stamping but it is truly ineffective as it was intended to be used.</li>
    <li> I really like this polish. The style of the bottle makes it very easy to use. I normally have shaky hands when I use regular nail polish, but since I could hold this like a pen it made it easier to apply without as big if a mess around the edges to clean up. And it dries really fast as well.</li>
    <li> Loving it! These pens are so easy to use painting your own nails.  The chrome colors are so different, and classy, and I am not a teenager.  The shipping was soooooooooo fast!!!! So happy!!!!</li>
