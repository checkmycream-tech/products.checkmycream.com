      <li>Not too strong, not too floral, not musky, very appealing.  </li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t too many perfumes or colognes that match well with my chemistry</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real shame because this summery scent smells great on</li>
      <li>I am in love with the fragrance.</li>
      <li>will get more</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>Its kinda a spicy smell but its not horrible...</li>
      <li>a gift for myself I love</li>
      <li>thank you Amazon :)</li>
      <li>but this one surely does.</li>
      <li>my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume EVER.</li>
      <li>This perfume is a lovely mix of floral, and a touch of spice (sexy).</li>
      <li>I just love this perfume and was so glad glad when I found it, as it isn&#x27;t available from many stores now ...</li>
      <li>I was thrilled I got such a great deal on my favorite perfume that I am used to spending $70 on.</li>
      <li>It is totally worth the price!!</li>
      <li>Until then, I will continue to love this perfectly balanced perfume-not too floral, not too sweet, not too spicy but just enough of everything!</li>
      <li>But not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Everyone noticed when I used it first and everyone liked it.</li>
      <li>Fell in love with this perfume the first time I came across it!</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy this again however, very sexy fragrance!</li>
      <li>Exact thing is right here!!!</li>
      <li>Another fantastic perfume from Elizabeth Arden.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly &amp; as described</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really fresh and sweet.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite scent.</li>
      <li>This is different from &amp;#34;Pretty&amp;#34;, but just as nice.</li>
      <li>I had been out of Pretty Hot for a while, so when it came yesterday I was elated!</li>
      <li>Her favorite has always been Red Door, but this is right up there with it.</li>
      <li>If you want to smell and feel sexy, this is definitely one to try.</li>
      <li>The smell is floral and fruity and quite nice, but it lasts for all of half an hour.  </li>
      <li>My husband bought 2 large bottles for Christmas</li>
      <li>The delivery was fast.  </li>
      <li>Wife really loves this gift.</li>
      <li>We highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I love expensive perfume but can&#x27;t afford to purchase it on my own.  </li>
      <li>Seductive scent, enjoy wearing it as much ads possible; your price was more than 50% less than depth.</li>
      <li>When this bottle is gone I&#x27;ll be back to purchase another one here at Amazon and maybe even try the partner perfume &#x27;Pretty&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Got it first at Kohl&#x27;s with a 30% off coupon but the bottle was smaller and the price was still slightly higher than what we paid for this BIG bottle.  </li>
      <li>This scent is sweet and a little</li>
      <li>I love the fact that all you need is a small spray of this and it lasts a very long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little &#x27;bold&#x27; at first until it settles down and works WITH my chemistry.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, spicy and romantic.</li>
      <li>This is a unique scent that is not overpowering, yet lingers deliciously.&lt;br /&gt;Not too flowery, citrusy nor musky - hard to find a scent lately that is just right.</li>

<li> its not a great smell either tho.</li>
<li> I am sad that they have stopped making this perfume.  </li>
<li> It even smells expensive, not overly priced either (on sale) as I see here.</li>
<li> So sad to see it go!</li>

    <li> Excellent purchase. Shipment was great</li>
    <li> You could go to a department store and pay triple the price.  Exact thing is right here!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is floral and fruity and quite nice, but it lasts for all of half an hour.  It&#x27;s a real shame because this summery scent smells great on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband however claims it smells like air freshener, so there you go.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the fragrance. Everyone noticed when I used it first and everyone liked it. It is totally worth the price!!</li>

    <li> I was expecting a different smell. Its kinda a spicy smell but its not horrible...its not a great smell either tho. But i did recieve my pkg in a timely manner and i was very happy with the shipping process.</li>
    <li> Elizabeth Arden comes through again! This is a unique scent that is not overpowering, yet lingers deliciously.&lt;br /&gt;Not too flowery, citrusy nor musky - hard to find a scent lately that is just right.</li>
    <li> Seductive scent, enjoy wearing it as much ads possible; your price was more than 50% less than depth. Stores.</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume and was so glad glad when I found it, as it isn&#x27;t available from many stores now ... thank you Amazon :)</li>
    <li> I received this perfume as a gift.  I love expensive perfume but can&#x27;t afford to purchase it on my own.  I am so delighted with this fragrance! It&#x27;s a little &#x27;bold&#x27; at first until it settles down and works WITH my chemistry. I love the fact that all you need is a small spray of this and it lasts a very long time.

    <li> AWESOME....smells GREAT!!  Love all of Elizabeth Arden perfumes and this one is another to add to the list!!!!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance to add to my arsenal. It&#x27;s soft, spicy and romantic. I can wear this fragrance all year long. It&#x27;s perfect for hanging out downtown with friends in the summer or even a fall afternoon date at the theater. Not overpowering at all, in fact I wish the scent lasted just a tad longer. My honey could still smell it up close to me, I may have become immune to the scent by then, not sure. I would definitely buy this again however, very sexy fragrance!</li>
    <li> GOOD NIGHT&lt;br /&gt;I ALREADY GET IT THE PERFUME OF ELIZABETH ARDEN AND I LOVE IT THE PRODUCT IT IS GOOD ! SEE YOU</li>
    <li> I was thrilled I got such a great deal on my favorite perfume that I am used to spending $70 on.</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast.  However the perfume has a weakened scent and somewhat &amp;#34;aged&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
