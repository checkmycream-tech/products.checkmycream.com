<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this stuff every day, morning and night on my face. It really helps keep my face clear from blemishes. Kind of a funky odor to it but it&#x27;s not bad and doesn&#x27;t linger. I love it</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying one without alcohol, it appears as though they have fixed the picture. Before it was the yellow label alcohol free version. Was sent the blue bottle, but like I said it is fixed now. Returns were easy.</li>
    <li> The product came when scheduled in perfect condition. I used it to make up a few batches of bug spray for my family, along with some other ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, as far back as the early 70&#x27;s.  Witch hazel is good for removing make-up.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it daily as a Facial Toner it&#x27;s great for the skin. But I  wouldn&#x27;t purchase as an add on Item again as it took nearly 2 weeks to arrive</li>
    <li> I have used Witch hazel for more years than I can Remember.  My skin (face) isn&#x27;t comfortable until I wipe it down with Witch Hazel on a cotton ball after I have washed my face. Moistuizer and cosmetics apply better after using Witchazel. However for about the past year I couldn&#x27;t find Witchazel at Walgreens every time I looked for it and they seemed to discontinue selling the large bottle alltogether. Buying it on Amazon is so easy and convienent and gets here in two days. Totally satisfied with the product and Amazon.</li>
    <li> Witch hazel is a excellent astrigent! Product was priced very high though, much cheaper at Wakmart.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the smell of this witch hazel. I was originally using it for a cloth wipe solution, but I like it so much I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle to keep around the house.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I will be a return customer.</li>
    <li> To: DreamUniverseOnline  Thank you for your timely shipping!  We received the item today in excellent  condition and appreciate your careful attention to our order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nearly 20, and decided that my one bad experience with toner shouldn&#x27;t shy me away from others (my sister had me try Sea Breeze when I was younger and not only did it sting, but also dried me out and inflamed my cheeks). I had been looking at the Thayer products because of the high ratings, when I noticed this one. Not only was it cheaper, but had more fluid ounces, and decided to get it. Right before I was going to add it to my cart, I had the sudden urge to see if Walgreens carried it. I checked, and not only did they have it in stock near by, but it was marked down from 4-something dollars, to 2.99! Not wanting to wait, I went and snatched myself a bottle within the hour and tried it for the first time along with a 6.8oz of Nivea&#x27;s Soft Moisturizing Cream (I&#x27;ll be reviewing that next) and I could see the difference immediately. My skin&#x27;s overall tone looked very well, and it didn&#x27;t sting at all. In fact, it felt quite refreshing, so I held a cotton pad of it over my eyes for a bit (I suffer from pollen allergies and my eyes have taken a beating this spring). The smell to me isn&#x27;t bothering at all. In fact, I think my mother had this one cream with Witch Hazel in it, so the scent of the toner was vaguely nostalgic for me. For some reason it almost reminds me of canned fruit or something. I used it again this morning, and in total~ I&#x27;m really diggin&#x27; this stuff.</li>
    <li> great product and one of the few liquids that I ordered which came without spill in the box.</li>
    <li> It works really good, but I think next time I will order the one without alcohol</li>
    <li> Worked on the dog&#x27;s bum, worked on her face, worked on her arm.&lt;br /&gt;Slight odor, but not strong.  Pop-top is convenient for applying to cotton ball.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, keep a spray bottle in the bathroom for after shave.</li>
    <li> Great price.  It&#x27;s 100% natural and works well to tone my skin.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> Good product for my essential oil</li>
    <li> Been a longtime user of Dickenson&#x27;s - you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is excellent. With so many uses..</li>
    <li> HAS A STRANGE ODOR - PREFER THAYER&#x27;S UNSCENTED WITCH HAZEL</li>
    <li> You can get this at your local walmart for $3.19 whereas Amazon is pricing it at 8.53. My sister introduced me to the witch hazel &amp; I love the results I get from it; So i decided to look on Amazon to see how much it was going for. When I seen the $8 amazon wanted for a bottle, I asked my sister how much she normally pays. She was astonished It was that high, I priced checked on Walmart.com &amp; it&#x27;s way less than Amazon! Amazon is getting pretty bad about pricing things alot higher than they&#x27;re worth! Shame on you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Found it at walmart for 3.19! Also doesn&#x27;t state that it contains 14% alcohol.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and perfect</li>
    <li> This product showed up when I was searching for alcohol free astringent.  But reading the back of the bottle, after I bought it, the active ingredients reads \\&quot;100% all natural witch hazel, containing Alcohol 14%\\&quot;.  I wonder how is this alcohol different than well, Alcohol.  I&#x27;m still using it since I paid a lot of money for it.  But I wish I had known what is exactly in the ingredients before I bought it.</li>
    <li> Works really well without drying out your skin</li>
    <li> We usually have this on hand (you can get it anywhere, Target, Walgreens etc) and use it for all sorts of things. It is not 100% Witch Hazel, it does have alcohol in it, but it is still gentle and works wonderfully. It is a great product for the price as well, as pure Witch Hazel can be quite expensive.  We use it on everything from blemishes to ear aches to cuts. I first discovered it at least 10 years ago when I had an infected piercing that simply wouldn&#x27;t heal, within a couple days of using this the piercing was completely healed! Since then I ALWAYS keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this!  Keeps your skin glowing without drying it out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Witch Hazel, not much you can say about it.  It&#x27;s an astringent and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Dr. Perricone&#x27;s Super Detox Elixir? What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Murad Clarifying Toner?  What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Olek Henriksen Grease Relief Face Tonic?  I could go on and on.....but I&#x27;ll just let you know. It&#x27;s witch hazel, which you can find in your local pharmacy for a few bucks,  is a great astringent. And its one in its purest form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is witch hazel? It is the leaves and bark of the North American shrub known as Hamamelis Virginiana (sometimes you might see this on a label as an ingredient in your favorite toner or astringent instead of the words \\&quot;witch hazel\\&quot;).  Witch hazel naturally grows in Nova Scotia in Canada, and Florida in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch hazel can be used for so many things but using it as your daily astringent can not only give you great skin but also a lot of bang for your buck! In addition, witch hazel is an herbal and natural product and thus it is great for sensitive skin. You can apply it after shaving, waxing and any kind of skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason you can find witch hazel in so many skin care products.  It has so many benefits: it reduces excess sweating and oil secretion, helps with large pores, treats acne, and helps with various other skin conditions.  The astringent also has anti-inflammatory properties. If you have ever had a facial, you will notice that usually after extractions, your aesthetician will apply with hazel to your skin. Witch hazel can also help prevent the development of acne as well as treat existing acne and pimples. This is the reason why it is frequently used in acne skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another approach for using witch hazel astringent is treating psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, diaper rash and poison ivy rash in the natural way. Witch hazel is also one of the best herbal remedies for alleviating sunburns and windburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is that you can pick it up at your local pharmacy for about five bucks!

    <li> I have combination skin and severe acne. My aunt told me to try witch hazel; I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and the redness and pimples on my skin and reduced dramatically! Witch hazel not only works well on acne, but with insect bites and bumps. Grrreat product!</li>
    <li> received as described. Packed well. Fast shipping. Price is reasonable. Been using this one for years and this one is the perfect astringent ever!</li>
    <li> Good product &amp; prompt shipment!</li>
    <li> I like this Dickinson&#x27;s Astringent. I clean my face morning/evening for cleaning &amp; dark spots. Still have dark spot but I&#x27;m sure it takes awhile for them to disappears, I&#x27;m waiting but I will keep you updated. Thanks</li>
    <li> If you read all the remedies for men and shaving irritation /bumps.... they all contain some form of ingredient list that matches witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply with cotton pads and watch the irritation go away!</li>
    <li> I bought this rather than other brands because it specifically contained only \\&quot;100% distilled Witch Hazel\\&quot; with no added alcohol. But this morning when I opened it for the first time, unfortunately well past the return-by date, I smelled a strong smell of alcohol. Sure enough, when I checked the ingredients, you know what was written? \\&quot;100% all natural witch hazel, containing alcohol 14%\\&quot;. Well how about that! The 86% witch hazel that&#x27;s in the bottle is 100% natural. Good to know, but I don&#x27;t want the stuff and it was a total lie to say on the website ingredients list that it contains only 100% witch hazel.</li>
    <li> I use this as a combo this with a Neutrogena astringent on 2 facial pads to clean my face and neck (guy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as an aftershave, and all parts of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for disinfecting and healing cuts, burns, bites, etc.  Really soothing to the skin.  Great in combo with other products.</li>
    <li> As others have written of their personal experience, I too have sensitive skin. There are many products I cannot use. I found this on sale at mylocal grocery store and I love it. I use it in the morning on my face after my shower and at night before bed. It feels very soothing and I dont notice the alcohol.</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE this stuff! I use it on my face and it smells so good. It makes my face soft and it removes oil (sometimes it gets a little oily in the summertime) without drying. I think it helps keep my skin looking youthful too. I&#x27;m only 23 right now but at some point my skin will show age. I&#x27;m going to keep using it. :)</li>
    <li> I just purchased this to try for a more natural alternative for toners. I&#x27;ve used Thayers non-alcoholic formula with success. I have oily skin, clogged pores and occasional disturbances when those pores get aggravated. I&#x27;m late-20s and I&#x27;ve been told every seven years your skin type undergoes changes. I bought this after reading reviews and some people were angry it wasn&#x27;t 100% witch hazel. It can&#x27;t be 100% witch hazel it would be too strong and cause more skin problems than it&#x27;s meant to solve. Their formula uses alcohol because it&#x27;s a good carrier fluid to dilute the power of witch hazel extract. Its smell is smokey, with the mild alcohol notes. It reminds me of a barbecue. The smell will go away once it&#x27;s dried. The labeling says \\&quot;100% Natural\\&quot; which does NOT mean it&#x27;s \\&quot;100% Witch Hazel\\&quot;. If it were the latter we would have to mix it with something to use it safely on skin and I&#x27;ll bet we&#x27;d be using alcohol. If you&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin I&#x27;d use caution. The Thayers non-alcoholic toners are great for sensitive skin types it is less drying.</li>
    <li> Ok- here&#x27;s the thing: the image in the pic on the right hand side of the screen is the bottle for the DICKINSON&#x27;S ORIGINAL WITCH HAZEL PORE PERFECTING TONER which is a 5 star pore perfecting toner (See my other review). The words describing the product under that image are the descriptive words for the DICKINSON&#x27;S WITCH HAZEL- the one in the BLUE BOTTLE.  Dickinson&#x27;s does make a witch hazel in a yellow bottle. The differences between the blue and yellow bottles of Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazels? WITCH HAZEL EXTRACT. The yellow bottle has witch hazel extract. Amazon has to fix the blunder. I made a review for the PORE PERFECTING TONER (The image in the picture on the right hand side of the screen) but now that I think about it, on that page- THE IMAGE FOR THAT PRODUCT IS THE YELLOW WITCH HAZEL BOTTLE WITH THE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS FOR THE PORE PERFECTING TONER. I made this review because of the folks saying that they didn&#x27;t receive what&#x27;s in the picture. I believe them because I see the error. YOU CAN BUY THE PORE PERFECTING TONER at Walmart or your other preferred drug store for about $3 cheaper than what Amazon is offering. All of T.N. Dickinson&#x27;s products that I&#x27;ve tried are all 5 star witch hazel products. The only reason that I gave this one 3 stars is because of the ERROR here. The pore perfecting toner that is in the picture IS a 5 star item but I have a strong feeling that if Amazon doesn&#x27;t fix the mix up- YOU WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE GETTING THE YELLOW BOTTLED PORE PERFECTING TONER  BUT WILL RECEIVE THE BLUE BOTTLED REGULAR WITCH HAZEL. *I am LC from NC*</li>
    <li> Wonderful product to use as toner or dandruff relief.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use to clean out my 8 month old puppy&#x27;s ears after swimming at dog parks and in lakes. He doesn&#x27;t enjoy the smell (it&#x27;s a bit potent - chemical smelling) but I wanted to use something natural. I typically wipe his face off with a puppy wipe and then blot some of the astringent onto it to wipe out his ears.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth and crystal clear, very refreshing.</li>
    <li> This time on a trip to South America a friend asked me to bring along a couple bottles of Witch Hazel.  In fact, he Skype&#x27;d me and held up the bottle I had left on a previous visit.  He said he never knew of anything that served as many purposes.  Of course I took him a couple of bottles (and also a couple containers of the Witch Hazel pads).  You will find many uses for Witch Hazel ... as I have and now a friend in South America has.</li>
    <li> It treats my acne scars perfectly&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing&lt;br /&gt;My skin just liked it so much</li>
    <li> First, I have very weird skin. It&#x27;s impossibly dry on my cheeks, but an oil slick on my forehead, chin &amp; T-Zone. I had lots of blackheads and tiny under-the-skin zits around my eyebrows, chin and the sides of my nose. I tried everything and the acne only worsened. This cleared everything completely in 4 days. After I wash my face (with Shea Moisture African Black Soap) I use a cotton ball to apply the witch hazel to all the problem areas. My skin is perfect now. Warning, it does have a strange smell, and it&#x27;s not pleasant. I didn&#x27;t deduct any stars for the smell because it disappears a few seconds after application. It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it was a miracle for me. If nothing has worked for you yet, try it!</li>
    <li> Great product that works well, but I cannot stand the smell of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as an aftershave alternative and a quick splash of this feels good while simultaneously closing my pores.</li>
    <li> Hard to get too excited about a particular brand of witch hazel, but it is a good, inexpensive alternative to aftershave and sometimes helps my wife with skin irritations.</li>
    <li> Old-fashioned product that still works today at a better price to comparable products.</li>
    <li> I spray this product on my torso before working out to prevent breakouts. My aunt puts it on face towels, which she then refridgerates, and uses to freshen her face after working out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know witch hazel is inexpensive at first so i (over)paid to get it here. this particular brand of witch hazel doesn&#x27;t smell too pleasant. It worked, but I&#x27;d suggest trying a different brand</li>
    <li> Witch Hazel is a great natural astringent. Gentle on your skin but hard on your blemishes. My skin stays clear with little to no outbreaks.</li>
    <li> Wife used this with a pad and froze to deal with post-childbirth issues... very helpful product.  I&#x27;m now ordering a second bottle because it was so useful to her sore sensitive spots then that I imagine it may be useful in the future.  Good quality inexpensive product.</li>
    <li> No more pimples... :) It does smell funny, but I don&#x27;t care. I am happy with the product... Thank you Pinterest....</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT...I USE IT AS AN ASTRINGENT FOR MY FACE</li>
    <li> if u have sensitive skin that gets irritated DONT BUY i&#x27;m a mixed black girl and i put this on my face cus it summer i went camping and my face itched it stopped itching, then 5 mins later it still itched but this time worse not only that it looked red then i had red lines on my face like it some kinda stretch mark i immediately washed my face with cleanser and i&#x27;m hoping it goes away before i start school</li>
    <li> All natural, gentle (DOES NOT STING), very light fragrance goes away when dry, and it helps relieve acne. Couldn&#x27;t get better than that!    P.s. Walgreens purchase, June 2011, paid around $6 for the bottle. It goes a long way. I use cotton squares to apply it.</li>
    <li> For those of you that may have skin problems, blemishes, acne, etc.. Witch Hazel is absolutely wonderful! Its very affordable, I don&#x27;t know about you, but, I can&#x27;t afford those dermatologist prices! You can use it as needed, and it&#x27;s natural. Most of the products that you&#x27;ll use to treat your skin anyway, will have W. H. in it ANYWAY. So, why not save yourself some money and treat your skin naturally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN, this, is a product my wife and I could not find in Dubai. Go to a pharmacy and ask for W. H. and watch how many Homer Simpson looks you get! It&#x27;s like we were asking for weapons grade plutonium or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife LOVES W. H., she uses it and it works for her and keeps her skin looking great! And her friends and family not the difference!</li>
    <li> The product description here on Amazon says the sole ingredient of this product is &amp;#34;100% distilled witch hazel.&amp;#34; It does not mention the fact that it contains 14% alcohol, which I discovered from the product label after it arrived at my house. I can get a 14% alcohol product at my local drugstore for &amp;#60; $3. I need an alcohol-free product.</li>
    <li> Great bottle of Witch hazel.  Lasts for quite a while, I use as an astringent and in my brush cleaner for helping with disinfecting.  I have purchased other brands of Witch hazel and a lot of them have odd smells.  This bottle has a very mild not irritating smell.  I will be purchasing this again when I am done with my current bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is magic even my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use Aloe (because I am allergic to it) so this is great because it is without Aloe.  I love to mix this with my Essential Oils.  When I need to fill a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Contains alcohol, i wish it didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it got to me super fast.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I use it as a facial cleanser and it works great. I would definitely reccomend buying this product.</li>
    <li> worked well with my essential oils</li>
    <li> Great witch hazel product! I&#x27;ve used this product as a postpartum perineal spray and in homemade baby wipes. Worked wonderful for both uses.</li>
    <li> Grandma was right! This is the best for astringent for your face. No extra perfumes, oils, or other things that can irritate. It works great on minor bug bites as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who does not like wearing any kind of scent. I use this Witch Hazel daily as an aftershave lotion. It is an inexpensive and refreshing astringent and antiseptic that doesn&#x27;t sting and doesn&#x27;t smell. Some aftershaves sell for $40 for a 4-oz bottle, but this is highly satisfactory at about 1/40th the price per ounce. Strongly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use this instead of vodka for my lavender sprays. Great buy &amp; use very little for the price. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchse this and use it as a toner for my face. It works beautifully without being harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am 37 weeks pregnant and the baby has been very low in my pelvis for about 10 weeks.  So, of course I am suffering hemorrhoids.  They aren&#x27;t painful but they are there and I can feel them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all over that Witch Hazel was good for hemorrhoids.  I figured I would give it a shot.  I&#x27;ve been using Preparation H for about a week now with no improvement.  My package with Witch Hazel came yesterday.  I immediately applied it, just once.  I put a little on some toilet paper and dabbed it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning they were half the size they were yesterday when I applied the Witch Hazel.  I am so happy I found this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are suffering from hemorrhoids I would highly recommend this product!  Highly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I did ask my OB before I ordered it and she gave me the go ahead to use it)</li>
    <li> Use it every night. Great for toning skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a good six weeks now. I really don&#x27;t have bad acne. I have a bit of clogged pores around my neck were I wear a sports halter-bra during a very intense workout and no matter how much of this stuff I use on those areas, it doesn&#x27;t do anything to help. In truth, nothing has really helped those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I don&#x27;t have bad acne, I can only say that I&#x27;m sure it does help with that. When I have a rare blemish, it seems to work overnight. It is not drying or irritating at all. I want to add that if I use an epilator and I get red bumps from waxing, sugaring or epilating this does ease discomfort and helps deduce the visual bumps over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very medicine smell to it. It does go away once it dries, but I don&#x27;t care for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not unhappy with this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect miracles on specific skin issues. My four star is for the smell. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this and keep it on hand for those rare break outs and maybe for medicinal purposes as well.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite items of all time! I finally get to own T.N Dickinsinson&#x27;s witch hazel! I first tried this in high school recommended by a friend and I used hers. Didn&#x27;t know where to get it around in my area so I said, &amp;#34;what the hell?! why not amazon?&amp;#34; Love this item</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with mild adult acne and I have been using this product as a toner and cleanser. It makes my skin feel refreshed and clean without drying it out. It also has a calming affect on my skin. I can see my acne spots slowly fading and my skin is clearing up. I have been using this in conjunction with a  20% salicylic acid peel to help control my acne... and I was very worried about my skin becoming overly dry but rest assure this puts subtle moisture back into my face. This is a good product. My mom swears by this stuff and now I see why.</li>
    <li> I use this on a cotton pad as an astringent.  Love it!  doesn&#x27;t seem to dry the skin too much.  Have heard it is great topical medicine for hemorrhoids too, though I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
    <li> This works great on my skin and felt soothing on some insect bites I had.  I also bought this for a DIY facial recipe.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have another witch hazel to compare this to but it has worked wonderfully for me. I use it as an aftershave after DE shaving. It leaves your face feeling very clean and smooth. I always follow it with lotion but it does it&#x27;s job exactly as it should. It cleanses and tightens the skin and I wouldn&#x27;t shave without it.</li>
    <li> The picture shows the yellow witch hazel bottle, but instead I was sent the witch hazel in the blue bottle.</li>
    <li> What a ripoff!  I assumed from the price that this was the large bottle.  I could have bought 3 bottles of this at Walmart for what this cost me!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I see how well it works for my sister in law and I want to try it out to tame the discoloration of my acne. I will update this based upon my own experience as well but it really did even out her complection</li>
    <li> I use this every day on my face to keep it nice and clear.  It is awesome stuff, keeps my acne under control with out drying out my face.</li>
    <li> Great product, works to cleanse and prevent breakouts. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used witch hazel as a facial toner before, but based on the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. After a couple of weeks, I can say I don&#x27;t really see that it has helped to soften my skin. And if I had known how awful witch hazel smelled, I definitely would&#x27;ve tried one of the many scented witch hazel products out there instead! I&#x27;m going back to using the Avalon lavender facial toner and this will go in the cabinet to try on bug bites in the future.</li>
    <li> Be careful of the price. Can be found elsewhere for $2. Nothing unique about this product so don&#x27;t pay too much.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, my favorite toner/astringent. I have acne prone skin AND some dry patches. The witch hazel cleanses gently but thoroughly, and never makes my face feel tight or itchy. It even reduces redness. I recommend everyone try it out.</li>
    <li> Got this to use in my homemade natural bug repellent! Does the job! We also use it for many things!</li>
    <li> It disinfects and soothes those annoying red bumps you get after waxing - it kills the bacteria. I&#x27;ve seen huge improvement in the amount of bumps I get after using it for a week so far.</li>
    <li> I always loved using this stuff!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know anything about it. I bought it for my daughter who is pregnant!</li>
    <li> Witch hazel is a must for any medicine cabinet. Great toner for skin and perfect to help clean wounds. Tons of other uses as well.</li>
    <li> Contains 14% alcohol.  If you were looking for a distillate with no alcohol, this is not the one.&lt;br /&gt;The label on this package is very misleading.  It actually says 100% natural astringent.  Read the fine print.  I should have.&lt;br /&gt;The product is fine, IF it did not have this labeling.  It&#x27;s a bit disingenuous.&lt;br /&gt;Guess I will just have to use it in a hand sanitizer, as not everyone can use alcohol on their face.</li>
    <li> Good astringent, smells terrible though like dirty socks! [...]&lt;br /&gt;Check out all the ways you can use it and try it out.</li>
    <li> This is fine witch hazel. It is all natural, but it is not alcohol free. This was not mentioned in the description. It&#x27;s fine for use as an astringent, but you may need an alcohol free version if making natural products.</li>
    <li> Low alcohol content astringent, that is great for occasionally cleaning pores...  Used as an ingredient in many cosmetics.  Also healing for minor cuts and scratches.</li>
    <li> This is better for your face and forget the chaffing soaps.</li>
    <li> Witch Hazel is great for so many things! I love how cheap i can get it online and how quickly it arrives!</li>
    <li> This was totally worth the purchase! I think that the quality versus quantity of product was perfectly balanced. I would reorder again!</li>
    <li> I use in my recipes for homemade facial toner, and have had no issues with it.</li>
    <li> This just good ... a friend of mine introduced this to me and a few other liquid products and it works wonders I&#x27;m glad to have very close to flawless skin coming in the new year with</li>
    <li> Price hike I went to Walmart instead major ripoff. I&#x27;m an Amazon fan however I need to keep price checking so I&#x27;m not ripped off. That should be illegal.</li>
    <li> This is the big bottle. I use it as after-shave and it&#x27;s incredible. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive alcohol-based alternatives.</li>
    <li> This same item is $3.64 at Walmart, BUT please be advised this product definitely contains alcohol. It is NOT 100% witch hazel. Many remedies for dry skin call for alcohol-free witch hazel. Try Thayers if this is important to you.</li>
    <li> Is what it says it is.</li>
    <li> All purpose cleaner and toner.  Price is right too.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and seller, the packing was good and on time, the product works well for me. I am happy with every thing :)</li>
    <li> Using this product with soft tissue is much more effective than the usual hemorrhoidal pads. They won&#x27;t dry out before use and you can control how much witch hazel you use.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I bought it yesterday and my skin looks better already, pores are getting smaller and skin tone more even. After you use it you skin is baby soft and isnt dry!! You have to buy this there are no downsides!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time and as expected.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey and too much packaging - but good!</li>
    <li> I love Dickinson&#x27;s  witch hazel because it soothes, treats and cleans. I use it wherever I need to feel clean. I use it on my face to remove residue and it gets my pores really clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love witch hazel and this bottle will last me for a long long time!!  I loved not having to send my husband to the store and him calling to tell me he can&#x27;t find the witch hazel!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps with my blemishes and has been a great product since I started using it. Love that it is 100% Natural.</li>
    <li> The Witch Hazel has a light, pleasant odor and is in an alcohol solution. Was recommended by my dermatologist for scalp itching and it does help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years first thing in the morning instead of washing my face, which I do at night.  I have never had any adverse reaction and my skin is sensitive.  I see some reviews fussing about the small 14% amount of alcohol, but it has never bothered me nor stung when applied.  It cleans a little tones and doesn&#x27;t leave my face tight at all.</li>
    <li> its witch hazel.  not much to say.  took awhile for it to arrive.  not the cheapest that i have seen.</li>
    <li> Just pointing out to everyone criticizing that it is not &amp;#34;100% natural witch hazel&amp;#34; --&amp;#62; the description states &amp;#34;100% natural, witch hazel&amp;#34; !! The comma suggests two separate descriptors, so the product is 100% natural and the product is witch hazel (mainly). Please learn the purposes of punctuation when evaluating things you read. Your opinion is invalid if you cannot understand.</li>
    <li> #1 brand of Witch Hazel that I use every day on ANY part of my body. It is a gentle, refreshing, cleansing product, and I believe it is safe for all skin types. It&#x27;s a great economical astringent, and I keep a bottle in each of our bathrooms.</li>
    <li> This was advertised as alcohol free -- but the label says it is 14% alcohol.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, nice bottle and cap</li>
    <li> Am a big fan of Witch hazel - my Mom and Great Aunt used it religiously - really good and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.  Will continue using and ordering the same.</li>
    <li> Great quality Witch Hazel!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does has a slight smell, but it&#x27;s worth the purchase. I don&#x27;t need any expensive skin products now that I have this. My skin looks amazing and it&#x27;s good for so many things other than just  making my skin look good. I suggest this product to people in my every day life and I don&#x27;t usually do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side (which is not that big of a down side) Is that the product you get is a blue bottle, not the yellow bottle pictured. But it&#x27;s real witch hazel. So the color of the bottle doesn&#x27;t really matter actually.</li>
    <li> works great for the skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure why witch hazel is not completely main stream and used for everything. It really works for many problems from hemorrhoids to pimples</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Witch hazel has a toner for a while, I always apply it after washing my face.  Before this I has an alcohol free and unscented version.  I was unable to get it this time around so thought I would try this one out.  It works just as well for half the price, however, it&#x27;s got an odd smell.  The smell goes away shortly but you and everyone near you will notice too.  Don&#x27;t let this stop you from buying this product, it will work amazing on your skin, either for a heathy look or to clear up acne.  Just keep in mind it will have a odd smell, but that it will go away and no one will know.  If you&#x27;re really worried about it you can spend more on one that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  Every cleanser I use will either give me hives, over dry my face, or make it super oily.  This stuff gets the oil off my face without over drying it.  My skin feels clean and looks so much healthier after using it.  I swear by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it after I get my eyebrows done to help calm the redness.</li>
    <li> This works great for healing minor scrapes and as a natural astringent for oily skin. I also use it to dilute essential oils before further diluting with water for room and linen sprays (you can&#x27;t smell the witch hazel, bcs it&#x27;s only 1 tsp/oz). There are a bunch of other uses I haven&#x27;t tried yet. Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this stuff earlier. I don&#x27;t love the smell on its own, but I&#x27;m thinking of adding essential oils for topical uses (lavender for cuts and geranium for skin, maybe?)</li>
    <li> This product was as described.  Good price and in good condition.  Shipping was speedy and packaging was appropriate.  It has a top that allows you to control how much comes out, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting too much.</li>
    <li> Once you get over the odd scent, you will be pleased with the way it cleanses the skin without stripping it. It smells nothing like the toners and astringents you might be used to. The scent does not linger, but the clean feeling does.</li>
    <li> I use this in lieu of aftershave and it works well. This product DOES contain alcohol, so if you are looking for an alcohol-free witch hazel than this isn&#x27;t what you want.</li>
    <li> I love this witch hazel ,I love the pop open top for squirting on a tissue .  Witch hazel is great for cleaning and tightening the pores on our faces and helping with clear acne free skin, it has many great uses ...</li>
    <li> The product arrived in very fast and in good condition.  Been using it for my face and so far works great!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and goes a long way at this side. I mix it with green tea for nighttime toner, and use it before masks for a light astringent.</li>
    <li> Shady marketing!! it states &amp;#34;Ingredients: 100% distilled Witch Hazel&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;yet it contains 14% alcohol. :(( Disappointing</li>
</ol>
