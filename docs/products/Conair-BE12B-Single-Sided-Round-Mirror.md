      <li>GREAT MIRROR...</li>
      <li>The magnification is REALLY good, I can literally see the pores in my skin and it makes doing makeup a lot easier.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice lighted mirror, good magnification for me, but that light is VERY bright.  </li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>The light is great and allows you to work on all your imperfections.  </li>
      <li>nice for travel packs</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have power access it works just as great on the batteries but drains them rather quickly.</li>
      <li>The light is EXTREMELY bright however so after awhile it hurts my eyes.</li>
      <li>The light is also way to bright, i can&#x27;t even us</li>
      <li>This is ok for what it is.</li>

      <li>Bright light, nice colored frame, and very portable.</li>
      <li>Nice product Amazon, thanks again :)</li>
      <li>REPLACEMENT BULBS ARE AVAILABLE  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s fairly light without batteries.</li>
      <li>I use it as a background light and use my original mirror.</li>
      <li>I finally found a colorful replacement and I&#x27;m happy as can be.</li>
      <li>In order to SEE clearly, it&#x27;s needs a strong light shining on your face, which means a strong light is in front of your eyes.  </li>
      <li>The color&#x27;s really what throws me off the most.</li>
      <li>then the cool toned purple in the picture).</li>
      <li>so good that I couldn&#x27;t look at it long</li>
      <li>It is great for traveling and everyday, use as well.</li>
      <li>The light is extremely bright (I can light my way in the dark with this freakin&#x27; thing) which I like (just try not to stare directly at it on accident, it&#x27;s blinding from a close distance).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this same Conair Mirror since it came out on the market so many years ago.  </li>
      <li>When I traveled with this for the first time, I wrapped it in bubble wrap and placed it in a corrugated cardboard box the exact size of the mirror -- AND THE MIRROR SHATTERED.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased a mirror like this from Sharper Image.  </li>
      <li>As my eyes age, I need the use of a close-up mirror for certain tasks.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; but practically magenta, a much warmer tone</li>
      <li>This mirror really solves a lot.</li>
      <li>In order to see what I&#x27;m doing I have to get up really close to a mirror which is a hassle because the makeup brush or eyeliner pencil</li>
      <li>I covered the light bulb area with a couple layers of white post-it&#x27;s, and that helped quite a bit.</li>
      <li>It magnifies very well and is sturdy and  makes applying makeup much easier.</li>
      <li>too much magnification  </li>
      <li>The mirror on this one was not as magnified as my original but I am able to attach my own mirror to the base and that is the part that wears out on these.  </li>
      <li>I actually ordered more later to give to family members.</li>
      <li>The are almost exactly the same</li>
      <li>Complete junk!</li>
      <li>My 16 year old daughter loves this mirror!</li>
      <li>The original worn one failed when my two-year-old narcissistic grandson fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>The color wasn&#x27;t my first choice (or even fourth choice . . .)</li>
      <li>Its inexpensive, light is adequate, small enough to travel with</li>
      <li>otherwise I&#x27;d realize how old I&#x27;m getting hehe.</li>
      <li>As long as I don&#x27;t look directly at the light, or cover it a little, all&#x27;s well.  </li>
      <li>But was sad the first time I plugged it in my light bulb blew.</li>
      <li>but you really have to twist it off roughly if you&#x27;re a weakling like me.</li>
      <li>I only wish that this mirror came with adjustable height (it only tilts forward and back) and that the color wasn&#x27;t SO far off from the picture</li>
      <li>It was so funny to see him toting it around to admire himself that I allowed him to destroy it.  </li>
      <li>It is small, but powerful.  </li>

    <li> This takes batteries for travel or plugs in with included adapter.  The mirror section detaches and has a stand for tabletop use. It folds small enough to pack on trips. Battery life is not great, but AA&#x27;s are available everywhere. This was a replacement for an identical item that was used daily for well over ten years and traveled from Tahiti to England. I never even needed to replace the bulb. The original worn one failed when my two-year-old narcissistic grandson fell in love with it. It was so funny to see him toting it around to admire himself that I allowed him to destroy it.  The color wasn&#x27;t my first choice (or even fourth choice . . .) but it was the last one in stock.</li>
    <li> I have this same mirror and it was from Sharper Image.  The are almost exactly the same and I can interchange the mirror and base.  This mirror has only a 5X magnification and the sharper image one has 7X.  The sharper image one is a lot better and this mirror seems distorted.  The light is also way to bright, i can&#x27;t even us it.  The sharper image one is discontinued so i tried this one from conair.  I&#x27;ll will return it though since i don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> The light is great and allows you to work on all your imperfections.  I actually ordered more later to give to family members.</li>
    <li> As my eyes age, I need the use of a close-up mirror for certain tasks. This one works perfectly and allows me to tend to my brows perfectly</li>
    <li> This is a great buy, searched all over for since it was a discontinued product.  I finally found a colorful replacement and I&#x27;m happy as can be.</li>
    <li> I first purchased a mirror like this from Sharper Image.  They discontinued it at some point.  The mirror on this one was not as magnified as my original but I am able to attach my own mirror to the base and that is the part that wears out on these.  Great travel mirror!</li>
    <li> I like the mirror because a battery operated mirror with high magnification is hard to find.  The problem is the bulb burned out after 5 minutes of use.  Hopefully I can find a replacement bulb and it will work.</li>
    <li> Reminds of my sharper image mirror years ago.  I can use with batteries or the a/c cord.  The cord does not twist out of the mirror like other mirrors.  I prefer this mirror over anything currently in the market.</li>
    <li> nice for travel packs well I also use it on a daily basis IT also has an adapter and batteries</li>
    <li> Love it. But was sad the first time I plugged it in my light bulb blew. Any suggestions where to buy a replacement bulbs locally&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> GREAT MIRROR...RUNS ON AA BATTERIES AND DC POWER..  NOT BULKY....REPLACEMENT BULBS ARE AVAILABLE  JUST HAD TO BUY A VOLTAGE ADAPTOR TO SUIT AUSTRALIA</li>
    <li> Great magnification and bright light. If you don&#x27;t have power access it works just as great on the batteries but drains them rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Complete junk! Don&#x27;t waste your money. This thing burnt out the second time I turned it on.</li>
    <li> This mirrors bulb burned out within 1 minute of me turning it on.  I was super unhappy with this purchase, will not buy again!</li>
    <li> Disappointed because I didn&#x27;t read anywhere that this was a magnified mirror. I use it as a background light and use my original mirror.</li>
    <li> This is ok for what it is. I like that it can work on batteries or by plugging it in. And it&#x27;s fairly light without batteries. However, because of the location of the light, it was shining almost directly into my eyes when I used it, which was very uncomfortable. I covered the light bulb area with a couple layers of white post-it&#x27;s, and that helped quite a bit. If I hadn&#x27;t thrown away the packaging, I would have returned this item.</li>
    <li> I TRAVEL A LOT AND THIS IS THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD....IT GOES TO EUROPE, TO THE CAMP...EVERYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE CONAIR NO LONGER MAKES THEM, THIS IS ONLY THE 5X...I HAVE TO USE THE 8X, BUT ALL THE PARTS ARE THE SAME!!&lt;br /&gt;I BLEW MY ADAPTER IN IRELAND, DARN IT!!</li>
    <li> I have extremely poor eyesight and always wear glasses, the problem is when I do my eye makeup I have o take them off. In order to see what I&#x27;m doing I have to get up really close to a mirror which is a hassle because the makeup brush or eyeliner pencil I&#x27;m using starts bumping into the mirror and messing up what I&#x27;m putting on. This mirror really solves a lot. The magnification is REALLY good, I can literally see the pores in my skin and it makes doing makeup a lot easier. I only wish that this mirror came with adjustable height (it only tilts forward and back) and that the color wasn&#x27;t SO far off from the picture (it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; but practically magenta, a much warmer tone then the cool toned purple in the picture). The mirror can be removed from the pedestal but you really have to twist it off roughly if you&#x27;re a weakling like me. The light is extremely bright (I can light my way in the dark with this freakin&#x27; thing) which I like (just try not to stare directly at it on accident, it&#x27;s blinding from a close distance). But yeah, I like it. The color&#x27;s really what throws me off the most. It doesn&#x27;t match my purple decor at all.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great. It magnifies very well and is sturdy and  makes applying makeup much easier. The light is EXTREMELY bright however so after awhile it hurts my eyes. You can either use batteries or plug it in and I like having both options.</li>
    <li> too much magnification  - had to return it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice lighted mirror, good magnification for me, but that light is VERY bright.  As long as I don&#x27;t look directly at the light, or cover it a little, all&#x27;s well.  Of course, that&#x27;s the issue with all lighted mirrors.  In order to SEE clearly, it&#x27;s needs a strong light shining on your face, which means a strong light is in front of your eyes.  I don&#x27;t use this for applying makeup, I use it when I&#x27;m plucking eyebrows and other facial tasks, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works as a makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter loves this mirror! Bright light, nice colored frame, and very portable. The magnification is very good...so good that I couldn&#x27;t look at it long otherwise I&#x27;d realize how old I&#x27;m getting hehe. Nice product Amazon, thanks again :)</li>
    <li> It is small, but powerful.  the mirror is flat, so there is no distortion of the image.  it travels well - the mirror disconnects from the base, so it is easy to pack.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for several yrs but ended up either blowing the bulb or transformer while travelling; always bought the same mirror to replace the ones which I have ruined. Its inexpensive, light is adequate, small enough to travel with</li>
    <li> I would recommend this mirror to anyone!  I&#x27;ve used this same Conair Mirror since it came out on the market so many years ago.  It is great for traveling and everyday, use as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a another customer review that she used it when traveling all over Europe.  When I traveled with this for the first time, I wrapped it in bubble wrap and placed it in a corrugated cardboard box the exact size of the mirror -- AND THE MIRROR SHATTERED.  There is nothing behind the mirror to support it.  It&#x27;s a hollow lamp!  DO NOT BUY this.</li>
