<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great price for this cologne.......have been wearing this for years and not sold in the department stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell and wasted my money. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this !!  I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of all time!</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for well over 30 years.  No matter how much I spend on other perfume I never end up using them more then once or twice.  I always try to keep this Liz on hand.  It must just go with my body chemistry.  Love,it.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday...love it very soft perfume...always get compliments and very reasonable thru amazon...at the retailer they want 50 dollars...</li>
    <li> Everyone comments on this perfume.  They always ask me what perfume are you wearing ... it smells so fresh!  I have worn it for years and I love it..</li>
    <li> light clean not overpowering</li>
    <li> This is one my 4 favorite scents. I use it and get complicated often. It&#x27;s not overpowering but fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the speedy service I received from this seller.   I would use this seller again.  The item was received in excellent condition.  It was very well protected when packed.</li>
    <li> The scent wasnt as pleasant as I thought it would be.  Kinda smells \\&quot;old ladyish\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Was not happy that I couldn&#x27;t return it soon after I received it and realized it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> great price for a really good product that my wife loves. fast shipment, I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Liz Claiborne perfume for my mother&#x27;s birthday.  I had free shipping which usually would mean about 7 days before I get it.  Instead, I received it the next day !  It was a large and decorative bottle.  Great value !</li>
    <li> If you like the Chanel No. 5 scent, this is one you will enjoy wearing. I always turn to Liz Claiborne for a classic approach to everyday. I have used &#x27;Claiborne&#x27; for years and am always complimented when wearing it. I am VERY SENSITIVE to perfumes and colognes and this is one that is reasonably priced, yet carries a much more expensive quality to it. It can be a little difficult to locate from time to time, but I can always count on Amazon to have it available when I can&#x27;t locate it a nearby store.</li>
    <li> Was as advertised....love it.....thank you....</li>
    <li> I LOVE Liz perfume and I couldn&#x27;t believe I found it cheaper on Amazon.  I&#x27;ll be buying more when I need to!</li>
    <li> My mom gave me a bottle of this perfume in 1986 as a gift. She never liked the scent, but it was always my favorite. It is THE ONLY perfume that I have used up and repurchased more than once. It is a great light everyday scent for me (it did not smell the same on my mom, though). I just think this is a classic scent that will always appeal to me. And, this is a good year-round scent. I tend to wear some perfumes only during certain seasons...ie spring/summer vs fall/winter, but this one is good anytime of the year.</li>
    <li> I have been using Liz Claiborne for 20+ yrs. This is the only fragrance that does not give me an \\&quot;instant headache\\&quot; or bothers my sinuses. It is hard to find in any stores, especially this size. I thank you for offering it on Amazon.com. Please do not discontinue selling the product.</li>
    <li> Claiborne By Liz Claiborne for Women is a beautiful light refreshing scent. Every time I wear it I am complimented on my fragrance.  I found it by accident on sale about a year ago. When I ran out and went to purchase more it was out of my budget.  To find it here on Amazon.com at such a great price was like finding a treasure. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the price.</li>
    <li> This does not smell anything like liz claiborne :(  I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for many years so I would know what it should smell like.  Thank goodness it was not a lot of money.</li>
    <li> The bottle of fragrance I received does not smell the same as the scent I have been using. I&#x27;ve worn Liz Claiborne for over 20 years. This does not smell like the Liz Claiborne that I&#x27;m currently using that I bought from a department store. This fragrance has a strong musty and alcohol odor. Not sure if the bottle I received was old or if there is something wrong with this particular product. It is obviously defective in some way. Amazon&#x27;s website states it can&#x27;t be returned. I will never buy fragrance through Amazon.com again. Wish I could give this product less than one star.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Amazon customer service was amazing and gave me a refund. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent for years.  It doesn&#x27;t burn and I am not allergic to it.&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> Been using this for many years and still love it after all these years, don&#x27;t you?  Will continue to use it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I used this perfume in the late 80&#x27;s and loved it then, I also got lots of compliments. I saw it on amazon in dec. and bought it. the price is great, it still smells great and i still get compliments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for 20 years.  It is my favorite all time.</li>
    <li> I love Liz Claiborne, it is one of the older one but I just love it and get a lot of complements about it when ever I wear it.</li>
    <li> I got this because the perfume I originally ordered was too much for my credit 7 other Money wasn&#x27;t back on credit card yet. I thought it was regular Liz Claiborne like the Red lid just different color so got it used to wear red lid years ago &amp; loved the smell  but this is horrible. The smell is just sickening, cannot believe it. Just shocked!! Guess it will sit in box. Sad because Amazon has never disappointed me EVER!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for years but the star I shop at stip selling it.  I purchase it from Amazon and I love it and got a few compliments😄</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LIZ CLAIBORNE FOR YEARS  THE PRICE HERE IS GREAT THANK YOU</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite...I hope it is always on the market because I get so many compliments about how good I smell...</li>
    <li> I have used Liz Claiborne Eau De Toilette Spray for more years than I care to count. I get many compliments as it is a fresh light scent, not over powering.</li>
    <li> Why not. We all deserve to go out of our way and reward all our hard work. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re a fool.</li>
    <li> inexpensive fragrance, but very up tempo .</li>
    <li> I have been using Liz Claiborne perfume for years. It is my favorite. And I was so exited to see that I could purchase the Eau De Toilette Spray online through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Thank you for having this perfume.  I used to wear this all the time years ago.  I love this!!!</li>
    <li> I love this scent. it was released when I was in high school, and now my oldest daughter wears it too. hard to find in retail shops so i&#x27;m glad I found a good source online.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This was one of my all time favorite scents, but I think they changed or it&#x27;s a knock off ??? Will keep though, but not in my fave list any more 😳</li>
    <li> Nice price for this product.</li>
    <li> AWFUL!  So old and doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Liz Clairborne use to.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for many years; and really enjoyed wearing it.  Lately it seemed harder and harder to find at local stores.  When I found it on Amazon I was very pleased. I received it promptly and am enjoying this scent once again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It brings back so many memories.  I am so glad amazon carrries it.  I ordered one for me and one for my sister.  Please keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance.  I looked for it for several years and didn&#x27;t recognize it.  However, found it thru Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Seems they have everything I need.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom for xmas one year and SHE LOVED IT. This is one of her FAVORITE perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she asked how much I spent (because usually its really expensive) she was shocked and impressed! I am so happy she loved it, and because its such a good deal, I will buy it for her again when she runs out! That is, if she don&#x27;t come buy it on here herself (;</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite perfume.  I have worn it for years, and it goes well with my body chemistry.  It has a nice, light smell, and not overbearing or heady.  The combination of ingredients is PERFECT!!  This is an excellent price.  When I put it on, it makes me feel happy.  I have received numerous compliments when I wear this  ....  probably hundreds.  I have had people follow me around the store, mall and supermarket, just to ask what fragrance I am wearing.  Once, a gas station attendant put his head inside my driver&#x27;s window to take a whiff, and to ask me what fragrance I was wearing.  LOL LOL  This is the one my family and grand children say reminds them of me whenever they smell it.  I shall wear it as long as they keep making and selling it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, as we both love the scent. What else can you really say? A good deal for a great perfume. This particular seller even sent me some samples of other fragrances and a small compact in the box, which was a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the fragrance of this perfume.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to self for under the Christmas tree and it wasn&#x27;t until april that I finally opened it and it must be really old - it smells like an old ladies perfume.  I have used Liz for 20 years now and I never had it smell like this does.  I am now out my money seeing I bought this 4 months ago.  If you purchase this open and smell right away so you can exchange it before yout hrow out your packages.</li>
    <li> Sometimes hard to find, but this is my favorite fragrance and has been for years!  Super easy to order at a good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent // I love it.. When I can I will purchase another one .. of course. Tanks for this purchase</li>
    <li> Love Liz and she&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of strong perfumes.  Liz Claiborne has a light scent and it&#x27;s not over powering at all.</li>
    <li> I bought Claiborne when it first came out and I have used it ever since.  It is just a classic fragrance and I am constantly asked what scent I am wearing.  It has become my signature scent;</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom for Christmas, why mark it as prime if your not gonna give 2 day shipping? I am glad my membership expires Christmas eve. As for the perfume this is my moms favorite, she&#x27;s gonna love it.</li>
    <li> it is one of her favorites so I made a lot of brownie points with this and it is very reasonably priced</li>
    <li> Had leaked in the box, but they refunded my money. But the package smelled good before I even opened it.</li>
    <li> Love the savings.  Everything as expected, great delivery.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> A long time favorite. The Eau de Cologne lasts a long time. Arrived sooner than expected. I&#x27;d buy again, and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t imagine what those people who criticized this cologne received - mine was exactly the same as what i have been using lo these many years.  it&#x27;s not easy to find and i was delighted to see it on amazon - amazin amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Now who of us wouldn&#x27;t like Liz Claiborne???  Love the smell, like to use it on special occassions, or sometimes just to go to the store!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and know it was bought on Amazon.  It is definitely not the fragrance I had before.  It is totally different and doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much! This is my FAVORITE perfume and only at a fraction of the usual price anywhere else! Hands down, THE BEST! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find this. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores so I had to buy other perfumes. I still love it.</li>
    <li> Was thrilled to find this on Amazon.  My sister used this for years and has been unable to find it for quite awhile.  I got this for her and she was thrilled.  Her favorite scent.</li>
    <li> The wrong perfume was purchased</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume!  because it is an older version, it is difficult to find.  I was so happy to find it!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Try it you might love it I do</li>
    <li> i love this perfume and i have for over 30 years. i still get compliments on the wonderful spring like smell. i am so glad that i have found it in a larger bottle. no one in our area carries the larger bottle. a must buy for anyone.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I always look at the percentage and the price..this person happened to have both and now I know why.  Everything was great including the packaging.</li>
    <li> This perfume smell good and it last for a few days too it came on time and i give it and A for all area</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I received it within a few days! Awesome!!! I will definately buy from them again.</li>
    <li> when i recived my order it was the wrong perfume they were quick to respond and get the problem resolved</li>
    <li> love, love, love this.</li>
    <li> I love Liz Claiborne!!! I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since I discovered in the late 1980s..... The best ever made as far as I am concerned.....</li>
    <li> Fast shipping nice perfum</li>
    <li> Worn it for years and love it. Fresh and clean scent and it&#x27;s not overpowering. I get many compliments when I wear it and hope it continues to be available!</li>
    <li> Love it was a gift for my mom... thank you</li>
    <li> Scent, so light had difficulties,smelling anything on my wrist. I&#x27;m very,very, disappointed by this it is so fifteenth from what I remember.  Very fake.</li>
    <li> The smell of this perfume brings back memories. My mom wore this perfume for years when I was a kid and I can never find it in the store.</li>
    <li> I have used Liz Claiborne since I was 16 years old. It has become harder to find in stores and when you do I stock up on it. I was hoping this was the real deal and not a knock off.  When I opened the package and sprayed the perfume I was very satisfied it is exactly the same perfume.  I will be ordering this perfume again.</li>
    <li> okay i am very picky about perfumes so maybe it is just me but i dont like this at all. the only reason i have not returned it is because i got it at a good price. i will be giving this away to someone who likes this scent or i will include it in my semi annual goodwill donations</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom. She loved the size and I love that I could delivery it directly to her in the east coast all the way from the west coast - thank you!</li>
    <li> This is an old favorite of mine....I saw it on amazon and it was priced right so I ordered a bottle, and it smells just like I remember.</li>
    <li> What a woman wants for Christmas. I saw it, I bought it, she received it as a gift and she is happy..therefore I am.</li>
    <li> THE BEST EVER 2 USE , I LOVE IT !!!</li>
    <li> Love this. Another staple for my moms perfume collection. She loves it and she gets so many compliments.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It has always been my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my Liz Claiborne favorites. As I stated before I think I ve had almost all of here scents. Everyone will compliment you on your smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like the perfume I used to get from Emporium Capwells in the late 80&#x27;s.  Will be regifting to my sister . hee hee.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND, NOT KNOWING IF SHE WILL LIKE IT..........WELL, SHE LOVE IT...AND WHEN SHE HAS IT ON.....I LOVE IT TOO...WOW.........</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite seem to have the same smell I remember as a kid, it has a faint urine scent to it. I don&#x27;t know if others notice it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she said it was old and did not smell like the Liz Claiborne she&#x27;s familiar with. The aweful thing is I can&#x27;t return it becuse it&#x27;s considered hazardous waste materials. Yet they sold it to me. Wow.</li>
    <li> I get compliments at work all the time for this perfume. I love it since it does not give me and my daughter a head ache from sneezing because it&#x27;s too strong. It&#x27;s just right for work and general use. May I say IT IS a Great smelling one.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance have used it for 45 years, unable to use anything else. Always get compliments on the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is still a great fragrance even after all these years.  The Eau De Toilette is pleasant without being overbearing.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Liz Claiborne Eau de toilette spray for many years now.  It is is light scent which lasts long and I always have someone asked me what I am wearing and they really like it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was really good for me and I am happy with it.  But I will not buy perfume on line anymore because you never know if it will be good or not.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as promised.</li>
    <li> This is not authenic Liz Claiborne since it has icky smell along with the fragrance.  Fragrance is right with exception of the added smell that is not even tolerable. Wasted money since cannot use.  Tried this same fragrance at Rite-Aid Drug and smell was same as this.  Really let down since don&#x27;t know where to come by the untampered original fragrance.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a bottle this big before! And I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 25 yrs! I&#x27;m totally satisfied!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this perfume at this price on Amazon.  3.4 oz. is a lot of perfume.  This will last quite a while.  I was hesitant because some of the reviews stated that it did not smell the same as it did in the 90&#x27;s.  I think the scent is exactly the same!  I love it!  The price was perfect too!!!!</li>
    <li> made my mother very happy. she love this perfume and it was a very reasonable price.I would order it again</li>
    <li> I love the Claiborne Eau De Toilette Spray because my daughter had it on her Christmas &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; and it arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it and is quite happy.  It is hard to find in stores.  I&#x27;m glad I found it because it is her favorite.</li>
    <li> Liz is my favorite fragrance.  I have used it for years. It melds with my body chemistry perfectly.  I get compliments every time I wear it; without exception.  It has become very difficult to find. Liz Claiborne has manufactured many new fragrances and for some reason this one has kind of gone by the wayside. So I was delighted to find it on Amazon and hope I will continue to be able to find there.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the original Liz Claiborne scent that I fell in love with in the Nineties.  I was told that this was the one but it is definitely not the scent that it was back then.  Both my wife and I were disappointed and I can&#x27;t return it as they don&#x27;t seem to allow returns on perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money here.</li>
    <li> Perfumes, fragrances, and scents are all subjective to each person’s individual preferences and to complicate this issue, everyone’s body chemistry is different, which has everything to do with how fragrances smell, and it depends on the pH of your skin.  Therefore, my experience can be completely different from your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely wear perfume, but when I do, I prefer a fragrance that is very light and pretty.  I do not care for either very sweet or musky scents, as they will give me a headache.  This perfume ‘Claiborne’ by Liz Claiborne fits my requirements in this matter, however, as I do not apply a large amount the scent fades rapidly, much faster than other fragrances that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, Claiborne has a light and pretty fragrance, not too sweet or flowery, however this pretty and light scent does not remain for long, and I just wish the fragrance would last a little longer.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find in stores and it&#x27;s my favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> The sprayer doesn&#x27;t spray out much perfume like it should. I have bought this perfume a lot of times and never got one like this one.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Liz and it was a great price.  Got it as promised.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great delivery.</li>
    <li> This is the best fragrance out there! And with this amazing price AND quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m please to say my aunt enjoyed her bday  gift she says its hard to find her brand a perfume and all I had to do was go on amazon and buy it .. Now she wants me to buy one every time she fans out .</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume years ago so I decided to try it since was so reasonably priced.  It smells nothing like the scent I fell in love with.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I was actually pleasantly surprised when I received it and realized it was the big bottle! I paid the same thing for the small bottle at Wal-Mart! Will be purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> This has been my scent since high school. But only 3 stars because it has a smell after opening like its old. Not as fresh smelling as I remember. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Old school smell, still smells great</li>
    <li> my Wife loves this thank you</li>
    <li> Always arrive on time and great price.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years, it&#x27;s my signature......citrus and yet earthy....hmmm....</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume she got some for herself and her mother for Valentines Day. She absolutely loved the price to</li>
    <li> my absolute favorite scent! I wish everything smelled like this!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted....speedy shipping</li>
    <li> I have wore this for 20 plus years and still love it! Over the years I have got so many compliments! It&#x27;s a soft sexy scent that is great to wear year round! It&#x27;s so hard to find in stores... So I&#x27;m glad to find it here!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I absolutely love the fragrance, the packaging...everything about it.  As long as you carry it in inventory, I will be reordering this often.</li>
    <li> I love the shape of the bottle. Priest gift for my grandma Christmas and it is not overpowering scent. Very settle.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom.  She&#x27;s worn this scent for years and still smells wonderfu</li>
    <li> This perfume is not typically sold in stores anymore and I&#x27;ve been using it for 20 years. I have allergies and sensitive sinuses,  this perfume is non-irritating and I constantly get asked what am I wearing because it smells so good. I don&#x27;t even smell it after spraying myself and just chuckle to myself when asked the question.  I love this original Liz Claiborne perfume!</li>
    <li> great size and good price love this stuff always get complements when I where it. can&#x27;t find this size just everywhere. very good buy, this is my 4th or 5th order.</li>
    <li> Not the same product that I had used for many years! The outer packaging is the same but the bottle and scent are totally different and the fragrance is not pleasant at all. Very disappointing, especially when I checked the return info and it appears that it is not returnable. Plan to call and see what other options are available.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a long-time fan of the old Liz Claiborne, don&#x27;t buy this product!!</li>
    <li> Smells very old. This is the second fragrance that I have ordered from Amazon that smells nothing like the original.</li>
