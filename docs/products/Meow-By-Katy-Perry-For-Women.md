<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> daughter loved the smell and wears it all the time</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites, despite the fact that I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume.  It is a very sweet scent that makes me feel sensuous and sexy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Beautifully scented perfume bought this both for my 14 year old daughter and my mother. Great value.</li>
    <li> My kids first wanted this last year and now my wife is hooked too. Kind of pricey for kids but oh well, thy like it.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells really nice! And it has what I call a double bonus- a cute bottle AND a necklace!  It smells very florals and a little fruity. The necklace is diamond studded cat with solid perfume inside!</li>
    <li> Was a great buy.my sister loved it.</li>
    <li> the scent fades away real quick and doesn&#x27;t last all day long , I would say it last like half hour , smells more like alcohol I would say it is not the original parfume, I had this before and it doesn&#x27;t smell the same 😒</li>
    <li> The bottle is adorable and a lot bigger than I expected!  Sweet, delicate scent...  I just love it!  I bought this as a gift but I&#x27;ll have to buy another one since I decided to keep this one for myself.  :)</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and I fell in love with it immediately! The perfume smells AMAZING! Not only does it smell great, but it goes a long way. Plus the bottle is really cute! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> 18 yr old granddaughter loves this perfume....</li>
    <li> I love the decanter and the perfume smells real good.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great. . .I get many compliments on it!</li>
    <li> very happy with this.  my daughter is a big Katy Perry fan and the fragrance is very nice.  she will be very excited when she opens itl</li>
    <li> The scent is really nice. The company I bought it from (discount perfum) packages it really good and was shipped in a timely manner. I would be buying again very soon! :)</li>
    <li> I am happy I bought this! Love the powdery, vanilla &amp; musky notes in It.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the authentic but it does smell nice (has a bit more of an alcohol-y scent to it than the regular along with some other scent difference I just can&#x27;t place)</li>
    <li> great value fast shipping</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift for my Granddaughter and she loved it.  This perfume is what she wanted for Christmas.  Linda Harris</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this perfume.  She says it&#x27;s perfect.  Not to strong nor to light.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it last year for Christmas and this year she wanted a larger bottle for her Birthday!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved this.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase!!!! It was a Christmas present. It arrived on time, the packing was excellent. Everything about this purchase was just fine. I bought several fragances for my family they were all very happy!!!!</li>
    <li> love the smell, much cheaper online than in Kohl&#x27;s. always get plenty of compliments when i wear this. kind of sweet but i prefer sweet fragrances. excellen price</li>
    <li> have two bolltle in the past, this is the third one, wont go out without it. got lof of compliment from friends</li>
    <li> i love the smell and the bottle is so adorable. the one of the reason why i purchased this perfume is bottle :))</li>
    <li> I thought the bottle was cute and bought it as more of a decor, but wow, the smell is horrible.  It&#x27;s sort of like a body spray trying to be a perfume, mixed with a headache.  I guess this would be a hit with pink sugar fans, as it is very similar.  It&#x27;s nothing I would be caught wearing, though.  There are so many beautiful fragrances out there, don&#x27;t waste your time on this one.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this scent and would recommend this product to everyone! it is very strong. but sadly doesn&#x27;t last the whole day :( you may have to reapply this perfume 1 -2 a day. but other than that its great quality and one of my favorite scents right now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this fragrance.  Purchased Purr as well but Meow is 10 times better. :) This might become my signature scent.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!! It has a sweet but not overpowing smell, then it goes to a subtle scent. I&#x27;m 25 years old and I am not into the musky scents like white diamonds etc... The more mature scents I should say, I&#x27;m more into soft, sweet, fruity Scents and this one is perfect. I think it&#x27;s perfect for teens and adults because the scent isn&#x27;t too fruity and it&#x27;s not sweet like candy but it&#x27;s a sexy sweet (lol if that makes scents....haha just a little joke) overall will def recommend this.</li>
    <li> Gift recipient loved the kitty which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. It&#x27;s not overly strong &amp; has a nice soft scent. I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments on it. I would highly recommend buying.</li>
    <li> The packaging is so cute, and the smell is nice as well. It kinda smells like Fantasy by Britney Spears, but more soft.</li>
    <li> This smells really good it has cotton candy mixed with a sweet candy apple scent to me. This fragrance also reminds me of enchanted by bath and body works same exact smell. Love it</li>
    <li> Purchased as Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;It is as cute as it can be.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as described and pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This made an excellent Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  It arrived perfectly packaged so the box wasn&#x27;t damaged.  I was happy with this purchase (and my granddaughter was also!)</li>
    <li> This was such a great deal.  I returned the smaller bottle with a much larger price that I had gotten from a major retailer.</li>
    <li> Arrived the day after i ordered it.. love the smell, love the bottle but the only problem was the packaging, the cap didn&#x27;t smoothly come off the bottle because part of the bottle was wedged into the cap, i was able to fix the issue though by prying it out, now it opens and closes fine.</li>
    <li> I ALREADY HAD THE KATY PERRY PURR PURFUME I HAD FOUND AT MARSHALLS AND I FOUND OUT ONE DAY THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER FRAGRANCE IN THIS LINE....AFTER READING THE REVIEWS I HAD TO TRY MEOW...I AM SO GLAD I DID! IT HAS BECOME MY EVERYDAY SCENT...ID SAY THE STAYING POWER IS GOOD LASTS A WHILE ...OVER TIME DIES DOWN BUT I FIND HOURS LATER I GET A LINGER OF IT! GLAD I PURCHASED!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so nice and light and fresh, perfect for everyday wear! And the bottle is so cute! Definitely keeping this on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> I love my new perfume and the timely manner in which ir Arrived</li>
    <li> It is perfect for a gift, the price is reasonable, I don&#x27;t know much about perfumes but girls just love it!</li>
    <li> Scent review: sweet scent reminiscent of confections without being too overpowering. Light and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle review: What to say? It is a cute, pink kitty cat.</li>
    <li> my niece love this, I came right time her birthday, shape is nice. My friends love it. They said will buy some.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume, it&#x27;s my new favorite and I&#x27;m definately going to buy more when I run out. It has more of a sweeter scent, unlike Purr that&#x27;s more floral. This is the 4th Katy Perry perfume I&#x27;ve purchased and it&#x27;s in my top 2 along with Royal Revolution. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and delivery was right on time.</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s my signature scent! Very sweet and soft. Seems innocent too. I totally dig it. I wanna buy another bottle so when I run out I don&#x27;t have to be without it. Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last long. Many perfumes give me headaches but not this one. It&#x27;s perfect! So happy! I would recommend to anyone. Definitely for a sweet perfume lover. It bubbly and fun.</li>
    <li> I think it is really cute.  I bought it for the cat container.  If you like cats, you will like this.</li>
    <li> Nice perfume for your daughter she&#x27;ll love it. Very nice scent. Your wife will love it too go ahead and buy it.</li>
    <li> Great scent and my teenager LOVES it.  Well worth the price and would buy again.  Not to strong and a nice scent for any teenager.</li>
    <li> Love Katy Perry perfumes.  They are all sweet, clean and soft scented.  Definitely one I will continue to buy for myself or as a gift.</li>
    <li> Scent wears off in a very short time.  Bottles very cute for collecting if that&#x27;s your interest.  Great smelling for the short time it lasts though,.</li>
    <li> Pleasant, like a fruity  milkshake, but it&#x27;s so soft I don&#x27;t even notice it unless I smell my skin directly. No sillage whatsoever. This would make a great first perfume for a five year old girl.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as good as other celebrity fragrances, like Britney Spears Fantasy and Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy.</li>
    <li> I just tore open the delivery box, and doused myself in this scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like Fantasy fell into a small vat of Pink Sugar, and the outcome was a headache-inducing, wretched stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantasy smells fine, I wear it.  Pink Sugar is a long-time favourite of mine, just for a point of reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Meow&amp;#34; is awful, and cannot be returned.  Go somewhere and sniff it before blindly buying it, like a dummy.  Lesson learned.  Finally.</li>
    <li> My child was so happy with the packaging and product definitely will be buying more for special occasions even her friends love it</li>
    <li> This is a very sweet, young, candy scent! I love it! I don&#x27;t think this scent is ideal for someone who is older so beware. For me however, this is the perfect scent!</li>
    <li> Smells like candy and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Great price on line and super stocking stuffer for my Katy Perry fan in the house.  The bottle is cute, too.</li>
    <li> I chose this perfume cuz it smells so good on my girlfriend. But when I purchased it I noticed the cent only lasted for a few hours then it just runaway I find myself spraying myself throughout the day several times so the perfume doesn&#x27;t last very long. However I do love the the smell of this perfume and it&#x27;s only a little bit over 20 bucks so for me it&#x27;s worth it to buy a couple of them cuz I like it so much.</li>
    <li> I discovered this fragrance about two years ago at a big chain store. I had a terrible time ever finding it again when I ran out. Luckily Amazon solved my problem and I was able to purchase more of it without running all over the state to try to find it.</li>
    <li> My teenage granddaughter got this for Christmas and I liked the smell so well, I bought myself one.  I would suggest trying to find it locally, it may be cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and really liked the scent. Then my 12 year old started using mine and it was all gone so I got her this big bottle for X-Mas for a great price. I also have Meow which is more musky and I&#x27;m using that now so I don&#x27;t smell the same as my daughter.</li>
    <li> This perfume was purchased for my 9 year old and it smells great for her.  She loved the bottle too.  I plan on making it a collection for her my accumulating the others.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the bottle &amp; it is purrfect for a cat lover, the photo does not do justice. BTW, it does smell nice too!</li>
    <li> Smells good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. Better for kids/tweens. What else can you expect from a cheap perfume, I guess?</li>
    <li> I used to love this perfume and I still do! It gives me a slight headache once in a while tho. It smells amazing and so sweet and fruity. Love this stuff &amp;#60;3 :) ;)</li>
    <li> Such a cute bottle but the perfume is sweet.  Definitely geared toward the younger set.  Great gift for a teen.</li>
    <li> Love d packaging&lt;br /&gt;Perfume smell gr8</li>
    <li> It smells AMAZING.., but doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 minutes... Kind of a waste of money :(</li>
    <li> Got it on a last minute Christmas stocking stuffer whim....&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loved it and the bottle was cool looking as well as great smell...</li>
    <li> smelled this perfume on a woman at a store and had my wife ask the woman what it was. I really liked the fragrance and got a bottle for my wife along with Katy Perry &amp;#34;Purr&amp;#34; and am very satisfied with product. shipped on time and a great price !</li>
    <li> the title meow is what I like and smell amazing like cream and ice cream strawberry&lt;br /&gt; just amazing I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super picky when it comes to my perfumes. I bought this one based on reviews alone and I have to admit, I was a bit scared that I wasn&#x27;t going to like it but i have to say I was not disappointed at all! This smells kind of like a mix between Fantasy by Britney Spears and Viva La Juicy (leaning more towards fantasy though). It&#x27;s a sweet scent (not too overpowering though) with a hint of class and it lasts an impressive amount of time, not to mention that the bottle is super cute! If you&#x27;re a fan of sweet smelling perfumes, or Katy Perry perfumes, I would totally give this one a chance. Very happy with this purchase and will most likely buy again!</li>
    <li> It may smell super sweet, however, there&#x27;s a slight musk that seeps through (more as time goes) that balances the sweetness and makes it so it&#x27;s not nausiating! The musk isn&#x27;t over powerful though, and it&#x27;s still mostly sweet. Very good for every day  wear and I agree with the other reviewers, it lasts ALL DAY! No wearing off! I just got it at kohl&#x27;s this morning, put it on, and it still smells amazing at 8:30pm. :) very happy!</li>
    <li> I usually wear Calvin Klein Eternity during the day and Dolce and Gabbana The One for evening.  This scent is so flirty and enticing.  It has amber accents to the lighter underlying scent which makes it an elegant and &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; scent despite it&#x27;s cute bottle and packaging.  I wear it all day every day.  I have noticed that the scent fades within a couple of hours so I tend to reapply it whenever I can.  Nonetheless, I have gotten many compliments on Meow from men and women alike.  Finally, I LOVE the bottle.  Looks great on my dresser, especially since I do love kitties.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great for younger girls.  It has a very fruity smell.  It smells very similar to Purr.  But, her newest perfume called Killer Queen is the best of them all.  I am a male reviewer and my daughter now has all three.  Killer Queen has more of an &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; scent but yet it&#x27;s my little daughter&#x27;s favorite scent of the three as well!  But if you like fruity smells, try Meow or Purr and even Killer Queen.  It&#x27;s also similar to Britney Spears Circus but an improved version.  Kind of like in real life.</li>
    <li> I can not understand all the hype about this!It smells like a cheep vinalla an musk, an thats about it!but maybe its just me! I wouldnt buy again! Its nothing special.</li>
    <li> When some other reviewers said that they could only smell the perfume for a few moments, I thought they were exaggerating.  Less than 15 minutes after applying, I hardly smelled anything at all, even with my nose directly on my wrist.  I sprayed the same area twice in under one hour, and that didn&#x27;t help.  While it lasted, though, there was the ghost of a powdery fragrance with a touch of pear...and there might&#x27;ve been a hint of vanilla as well.  I want so much to give this a higher review, because the scent is indeed pleasant; but it&#x27;s so soft, and I just can&#x27;t get it to stick around.  For this perfume to mean anything, I&#x27;d probably have to carry the bottle around and spray myself every hour.  At that rate, a 3oz. bottle would be gone in no time.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know what went wrong here.  Even by &#x27;light fragrance&#x27; standards, this would be ridiculous.  I don&#x27;t want to just jump to conclusions and blame the seller for sending me a product that was watered down.  Meow! itself hasn&#x27;t even been around that long to have gotten an &#x27;old&#x27; bottle.  I might have to see if I can find this in a store to compare.&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, the bottle is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. It&#x27;s a shame that I go through this perfume really fast. One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the bottle, I fell in love with it because it&#x27;s cute and I&#x27;m a cat fan! I have cats too. But in terms of scent, it&#x27;s not surprising because the scent is just somewhat like juicy couture Viva LA. I&#x27;m disappointed because i thought i would discover another unique scent .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the bottle but the scent is just like other known perfume.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to be a Katy Perry fan to appreciate this perfume for what it is. I find the scent to be only slightly floral, more fruity with a heavy base of vanilla and amber. It&#x27;s very light and clean. It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s not at ALL strong, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about overwhelming passerby with a heavy perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something subtle and feminine, this is the perfume for you. Not only that, but in this bottle, you can&#x27;t pass it up. Such a creative idea, and a really great quality scent at this pricepoint.</li>
    <li> This smells like candy, cotton candy, pear!! Its so light fresh and delicious! Love the color and unique bottle. Will order again and again!</li>
    <li> I just received my Meow perfume and whilst I absolutely adore the bottle,I have to say that I had rather higher expectations as to the exclusivity of this perfume/ according to the rave reviews online/.Instead this is just another generic  celebrity sugary scent,very reminiscent of Angel by Thiery Muggler and almost 99% identical to Fantasy by Britney Spears. It is a very bubbly, young, girlie fragrance,very strong and sweet.Age wise is probably more suitable for teenage girls and young women than for mature women,so please take the age factor into account when purchasing this perfume.I could not smell any fruit undernoters/peach,tangerine,honeysuckle/,just sugar,pure sugar.If you like cotton candy smells,then you will love this scent ,but it&#x27;s too intrusive and loud for me ,I like more subtle,understated,elegant scents.I would not re-purchase.</li>
    <li> The scent is not over powering! Ive had friends tell me it&#x27;s reminiscent of a spicey vanilla... I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it drives my boy friend crazy. I have enjoyed this perfume alot. I would recommend anyone who loves fruity smells to buy it</li>
    <li> The girlfriend adores it so I love it as well</li>
    <li> Great smell, I received a lot of complements by both men and women. It is however too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; for me; it&#x27;s a scent that a H.S girl would wear; smells like cotton candy and everything colorful. I would only wear this in the summer, because it can surely hold up.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it !!</li>
    <li> My daughters and I all love this perfume.  Smells great and such a cute bottle.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is delicious and the bottle looks cute on my dresser next to the other bottles of perfume that I own.</li>
    <li> ARRIVED ON TIME AND SMELLS WONDERFUL BUT NOT LOUD</li>
    <li> It smells okay, but it is a bit teeny-bopperish and the smell doesn&#x27;t last but an hour or so - then you have to reapply.</li>
    <li> This is a very sweet vanilla scent. I liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> This perfume makes me think of a dollar store perfume rip off. It is far too sweet, and it makes everyone sneeze when I spray it. Not happy with this product, but maybe for a tween it would work out.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume.  It last a couple of hours on me.  It more of a sweet scent so if you&#x27;re into sweet scents you may want to give this a try.  Came nicely wrapped and the bottle is a big size and very pretty in appearance.  I also went ahead and purchased &amp;#34;Purr&amp;#34; as well. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> The perfume was everything I asked for. It came unbroken, not even scratched, and smelled exactly as I remembered in the store. The bottle is adorable too.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and the price but the perfume doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I wish. However, that&#x27;s okay... I still love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Scent isn&#x27;t overpowering yet it lasts all day. It&#x27;s perfect for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a teenager or a 40 year old (no offence ladies!!!) It bears similarity to Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy, though, it isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;fruity.&amp;#34; Bottom line, its flirty yet modest.</li>
    <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t wear a celebrity fragrance, but I found this while browsing in Ulta a couple of years ago and I loved it. It&#x27;s kind of my secret shame. Now that she has other fragrances, Ulta seems to have phased out Meow, so I turned to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I would hope if you&#x27;re purchasing online, you&#x27;ve already smelled it in person. I find it to be a nice daytime fragrance that&#x27;s distinctive and appealing. I wish it had more staying power.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, but by the time I get to work, I can no longer smell it.  I have one perfume that stays with me ALL DAY and would give this 5 stars if the scent lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I tried it in a department store and thought it smelled awesome but, they wanted almost double the price that I paid for this one and it was half the size. I&#x27;m glad I came across this.</li>
    <li> Big fan of this fragrance and purr. This scent is sweet but not overpowering. I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;a big cat lover and the bottles are adorable. I&#x27;m a perfume addict and without perfume I feel a bit naked so this is a great everyday scent that can dress up any outfit. I hope she comes out with another feline themed scent...&amp;#34;roar&amp;#34; perhaps with a leopard print or turquoise bottle? Ideas Katy...ideas!-Brisce M</li>
    <li> I bought the 100 ML bottle without ever trying the scent before, because it never came to my city. There is not much to the scent, just a really sweet, soft, milky, SLIGHTLY fruity scent. It is very sweet, almost like bubblegum, but also has a \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; essence to it. Sort of like a Fresh Sweet Soft Pear, coated with bubblegum. Really great scent. The projection is nothing. No one could smell me. Didn&#x27;t last long on my skin, either. I also have a HUGE problem with the bottle. The \\&quot;M\\&quot; emblem falls off,and you can&#x27;t keep it on the bottle. The Rim of the bottle comes off every time you take the lid off, and it is really frustrating having to keep putting the rim back on every time you open the bottle. The paint also chips. Not just my bottle, every bottle is like this. Super cute bottle, but very troublesome, and complicated to own.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas , She Loves it .&lt;br /&gt;I Like it myself  , Thinking i might buy it for me next .. Happy with this purfume!</li>
    <li> If you love the smell of vanilla then this is the perfume for you.  The perfume stays with you and is not overbearing.  I receive many compliments from both male and female on what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> This product has a great smell and is her favorite present. She is thrilled and very happy. Very nice packaging.</li>
    <li> I got this in my stocking for Christmas this last year and I absolutely love it!! My roommate last year wore it everyday and I had wanted some ever since! Naturally, I was thrilled when I saw it that morning! It smells sooo good and I love the cat bottle it comes in, its adorable! My letter &#x27;M&#x27; hasn&#x27;t stayed on the bottle at all, but that&#x27;s okay. It&#x27; doesn&#x27;t detract from the perfume!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, it smells beautiful, the fragrance lasts all day, perfect for day or night! Thank you Katy Perry</li>
    <li> My daughter is a fan of Katy Perry and I am happy with your perfume. Excellent presentation and a delicious aroma.</li>
    <li> Meow arrived in 14 days, with a broken seal so the bottle was half full in a box which was damp. I sent an email to explain my concern. NO return email.</li>
    <li> soft, beautiful scent. Not offensive.</li>
    <li> I loved the perfume&#x27;s shape, but I bought it for a friend, so I can&#x27;t say what it is like..I think it&#x27;ll be good.</li>
    <li> I will get this one over Purr, I am a straight guy that does not mind wearing feminine perfume, I wear Curious by Britney, but I need my own new bottle of something good and this is it, and guys don&#x27;t be afraid or shy to try Meow!!!</li>
    <li> Just a wonderful surprise for my daughter.  Not having smelled or knew anyone who bought it it was a very pleasant surprise to try it out.  100%+ satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of embarrassed that I bought this but I really wanted the cat bottle for myself and my other friend who likes cats.  I don&#x27;t mind Katy Perry but I know some grown ups probably don&#x27;t.  Surprisingly I like the smell of the perfume as well.  It&#x27;s a sweet, candy, perhaps vanilla/cinnamon smell.  It&#x27;s not too strong so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m reeking of it when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it was half the price on Amazon than it was in the K@lh&#x27;s store I saw it in.  My husband thought it might be counterfeit.  I can&#x27;t tell if it is.  It came in the box wrapped in cellophane, the words on the box are all spelled correctly. ;)&lt;br /&gt;I like it.  I hope my friend likes hers too.</li>
    <li> Katy Perry both this  one and the the Prrr.. Smell like heaven love them. I cant even choose from one or the other. But I did buy the bigger bottle in this one totally worth it!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great and it is a bigger bottle than I expected it to be. I bought this as a present for my wife and she really liked it. With the relatively low price and the big bottle, I would say that this is a good deal.</li>
    <li> The bottle is beautiful and smells good too. It has a sweet smell. Have the other perfume as well Purr which I think smells better. They both smell good. Would recommend it. My order came fast as well. Thanks</li>
    <li> Lovely smell, it&#x27;s nice and sweet but not overpowering! I would recommend trying this perfume if you&#x27;re looking around for something new. I get a bunch of compliments on the smell of it. This is my second time buying this perfume because I just can&#x27;t get enough, it&#x27;s one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> This smells pretty good. It smells like Electric Youth by Debbie Gibson from the 1980s if you remember that perfume.</li>
    <li> This perfume is just what I was looking for, a sweet smell and a nice light spray.....now if only it didn&#x27;t come in a torn box, with a broken bottom and the charm jiggling around in the bottom of the box ! The head fell off the second day I had it, and when I went to fix it I realize the piece that connects the cap the neck had broken off inside the head! won;t buy from here again!</li>
    <li> This was a gift but granddaughter looked it</li>
    <li> Love my perfume. Smells soft not too strong.</li>
    <li> First time trying this fragrance I must say it smells, really good great price especially for size of bottle.</li>
    <li> I loved Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr, and especially the pretty bottle it comes in. So, I decided to give Meow a try and found I like it even more.  The scent is sweeter and fruitier than Purr.  Purr could be considered a more mature scent, as it has a musky undertone.  I prefer Purr for evening wear, but Meow is a great everyday scent.  And the two bottles look so cute on my dresser!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like sweet smells so when I first tried this, I fell in love. My skin has a way of sticking to sweet smells so I was happy that it came out really well. Even when the scent changed at first due to some high acidity or something, it smells slightly citric and fruity, but morphed into some sweetness that I couldn&#x27;t resist getting. It&#x27;s definitely cute too. No regrets! And what a price! It&#x27;s usually $61!</li>
    <li> I love the scent, the bottle and of course the price!!&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweet scent that any age would love it!&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this perfume</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teen daughter. The scent is light and sweet, almost fruity -- perfect for a teen girl. She loves it and tells me her friends (boys and girls) love it too. It&#x27;s fairly obvious that this perfume is marketed to the younger generation, though I enjoy the scent and I am no longer considered &#x27;younger generation&#x27;. I spoke to Amazon and they said because this is a flammable liquid, there may be a little extra time for delivery. When you order it, pay attention to the estimated delivery date and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> Katy&#x27;s Meow Perfume Smells great! Our daughter loves it! The bottle design is a good accent in her room too.</li>
    <li> The pear is the strongest fruit note in MEOW and gives the fragrance a light and watery feel. Combined with the whisper of tangerine, I find the fruits used in MEOW to be milder and fresher then those used in Purr. I also think there is a touch of peach to soften the fresh feel of the watery pear note down a bit. The soft vanilla is present through all of the fragrance, with adds a creamy sweetness and warmth to the mix from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floral notes used for MEOW are disappointingly underdeveloped. Aside from a breeze of orange blossom and subtle honeysuckle, none of them are strong enough to stand out individually from the fruits and vanilla. This is definitely a fruity perfume. I sometimes think that I can make out the lily, but it&#x27;s too short-lived to really be sure what I think I&#x27;m sniffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant trickle of pear, peach and vanilla. The sandalwood and musk are mingled closely together so it is a warm and creamy mix - nice, but it is nothing we haven&#x27;t seen before, many, many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent notes; Tangerine, pear, jasmine, gardenia, honeysuckle, lily of the valley, orange blossom, amber, vanilla, sandalwood and musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEOW is richer with the fruits then it is with the florals, so the lasting power is nothing to shout about. It averages between four to five hours - good, but nothing special. Purr focused on the fruit notes over the florals to, but it still isn&#x27;t as light as MEOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this is mild and sweet it seems like a playful fragrance. I think that this is best worn for casual daytime wear, as I personally think it&#x27;s a bit too young for work. As it&#x27;s mild and not very long lasting I find it too &#x27;gentle&#x27; for evening wear, but if you don&#x27;t wear perfume whilst out for a statement and to be noticed then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my Mum to pick up a bottle when it was released in America, close to Christmas last year. It was nice enough, but I found it too mild and watery in colder weather and the coldness seemed to halve the lasting power, so I didn&#x27;t wear it much. But now that its getting a bit lighter and slightly warmer I&#x27;m finding MEOW much more enjoyable to wear. Plus the fruit is watery and the florals mild, so it&#x27;ll carry through to the summer months too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: MEOW is &#x27;nice&#x27;. It&#x27;s pleasant and easy to wear, but it isn&#x27;t in the slightest bit original and the mildness of the different scent notes make it seem quite flat and one dimensional. Pair that with the so-so wear and you get another average, been-there-sniffed-that release. Out of the Katy Perry releases I&#x27;d recommended Purr over this, as the floral notes are a bit more developed. MEOW reminds me of something, but I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what. Victoria&#x27;s Secret Pear Glace body mist, or perhaps one of the Harajuku Lovers releases. Aha; now I think it was actually Christina Aguilera&#x27;s Secret Potion. So iff you like that then it&#x27;d be fairly safe to order a bottle of MEOW untested online.to Christmas last year.

    <li> meow by Katy perry is a great perfume it smells sweet and i am a boy a STRAIGHT boy and i wear it and purr and Nicki Minaj Pink Friday and Lady Gaga fame and all the Britney Spears they all smell good</li>
    <li> I purchased this because all of the reviews stated how pleasant it is and that it smells fruity. I wanted a perfume that I could wear as well as my daughters. I received this from Amazon. It smelled great and I sprayed my shirt a few times, then 5 minutes later there was absolutely no scent left on my shirt. So I tried to spray myself about 10-15 times, but I had the same issue. This perfume has no staying power and it was weaker than a cheap spritz. I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a bad bottle or what. But I won&#x27;t be investing in this on Amazon anymore. It has the potential to be a great perfume, maybe if I buy it from a department store it won&#x27;t be watered down or whatever was going on with it. The worse part of it all is that I can&#x27;t return it because my young daughter is attached to the bottle and won&#x27;t let me have it back! But I figure it&#x27;s weak enough for her so let her keep it!</li>
    <li> I love the shape of the bottle and the smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering but it lasts for me. I usually spray some in my hair before I leave and I get whiffs of it through out the day.</li>
    <li> she loves cats.&lt;br /&gt;loves the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;loves the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;likes Katie Perry.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend this to her friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find these on Amazon! They&#x27;ve been discontinued, so I worry about continuedly finding non-expired versions. However, I&#x27;m happy to say the product I received was fresh and has lasted a very long time. On me, the sweet vanilla base notes last all day. It&#x27;s quickly become my signature scent. Most celebrity fragrances don&#x27;t last and are sickly sweet, but Meow has a great balance!</li>
    <li> I bought it on a whim. I was looking for a lightly scented vanilla perfume and this one hits the spot. I got it in the mail quick and immediately sprayed it on. It lasted for hours on my skin and forever on my clothes. My boyfriend said he loves the smell and wants me to keep buying it so itll be my signature scent. Lovely bottle too(:</li>
    <li> Katy is one of my idols and absolutely love her! She has picked me up when I was down plenty of times!&lt;br /&gt;After I purchased her &#x27;Purr&#x27; fragrance, I immediately found out about &#x27;Meow!&#x27; it was a little irritating since i felt like i was late on everything Katy lol Nonetheless, this perfume is very sweet! very fluffy and delicate. It will leave you feeling cute. It smells like vanilla and maybe some cotton candy. After all, it is based on her California Dreams Tour! and she did want it to smell like her Caliornia Gurls &amp;#34;Candyfornia&amp;#34; setting. As for duration, I would say it lasts about, 6-7 hours (for me) it all depends on your skin really. Everyone is different. Overall, great fragrance! I look forward to her new scent &#x27;Killer Queen&#x27; !</li>
    <li> My granddaughter&#x27;s favorite and could not find anywhere else, so decided to check with amazon and surely you had it.  It will be opened around Christmas and she will sure be surprised.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> My daughter love the bottle and the perfume.</li>
    <li> I love it...I love the price especially I love her scents and I have purr already which is the purple one so I have a meow for my purr...lol love the bottle designs...thank you keep up the affordable cheap prices I definitely come back to shop again granted the prices stay the same</li>
    <li> This is just absolutely wonderful. It smells so fantatic!!! It&#x27;s really sweet smelling so if you don&#x27;t like sweet perfumes, don&#x27;t get it. Although I recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> Katy Perry&#x27;s meow perfume is very sweet smelling, almost like cotton candy-ish. Smells nice and sweet for a casual day to day perfume spray, not so suited for a formal adult occasion. Teenage girls and the tweens will love this! To top it all off the glass cat bottle it comes in is absolutely adorable. super cute to have set out in your vanity!</li>
    <li> Meow is great.  Smells like sugar, but not as overpowering as Pink Sugar or Fantasy.  It&#x27;s nice and light, feminine and tasty. A terrific perfume for such a low price.  And I think the bottle is absolutely adorable! Too cute NOT to have in my collection!</li>
    <li> it a really sweet candy like scent and it stays on pretty well. my husband loves it and so do i. you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one</li>
    <li> Fiance loved the scent!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice.  Just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I ordered this before, the price you cannot beat and I recommend it for girls n women of all ages ;)</li>
    <li> This is a large amount of perfume for a great price. It smells great, this should last me a while.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long and the bottle is very pretty, bought it for my mom but I had purchased one for me before.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! The bottle is so cute, I will keep it even after the perfume is gone! The perfume smells fabulous, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I just can&#x27;t stop smelling this perfume!! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> YOU CAN SMELL PEAR AND FRUITY AROMA .IT DOESN&#x27;T LAST LONG .&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A GOOD GIFT FOR YOUR G.F , BOTTLE IS CUTE AND GIRLY .</li>
    <li> I got this for my little sister and she loves it. I think the packaging is very cute and the smell is light and fruity. I would recommend this to any floral and fruity perfume lovers.</li>
    <li> Smells great . Like cotton candy on me</li>
    <li> For my granddaughter &amp; she liked it!</li>
    <li> Amazing product and great price..love the scent! Scent lasts a long time..sexy fruity scent. New fave</li>
    <li> This parfum was very sensual and very pleasing to wear. The life of the scent was decent, would require reapplication after 5 hours or so. Soft scent, not too heavy. Would recommend this to young women for a light and flirty fragrance.</li>
    <li> Perfume came super fast, however when I received it the tag on the bottle was missing (being the little metal &amp;#34;M&amp;#34;.) Wonderful perfume though! Love it!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this scent and it actually smells really really good, I bought it for my mother</li>
    <li> This perfume is awesome! Smells really softly like vanilla and isn&#x27;t so strong that it slaps someone across the face when they&#x27;re near. Love it.</li>
    <li> This perfume is not genuine. buy some days ago , perfume arrived with damaged and perfume bottle and lasts bounced the odorless one hour, for me it is not original. I feel cheated .</li>
    <li> I love this scent! I prefer this scent to Katy Perry&#x27;s other scent for the simple fact that this one is more sweet and less musky to me. I couldn&#x27;t believe how large this bottle is for the amount paid. I just think It&#x27;s a fantastic value compared to what you might pay in stores. If you love this scent, I definitely recommend buying it here. The shipment came packaged well and very fast.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re into sweet vanilla scents you&#x27;re gonna love this! I know I do! I like Purr too but I like Meow more. It smells sweet but it doesn&#x27;t make me feel dizzy... I get compliments all the time when I use it. I just wish it lasted longer.. :)</li>
    <li> This perfume is one of my favorites.  Not only does the bottle have a nice design but it actually smells REALLY good.  To me, it does smell a little like cotton candy (light and fluffy) but even better.  Another good quality is that it is long-lasting.  Two sprays in the early morning and, even after hours of working or going to school all day, I can still smell it on my wrists at night.  It never fails, every single time I wear this perfume, someone tells me that I smell good.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a go-to perfume for any occasion or everyday use, not overbearing, but sweet enough to leave a lasting impression.</li>
    <li> We bought a small roller ball size of this perfume in a department store and both of my girls loved it so for Christmas I got them both one.  Not only did my perfume come in a discreet, well packed box I go a lot of samples for other colognes and coupons!</li>
    <li> I would have never expected to love a perfume by Katy Perry (not that she is not great........but I am not young)  I was at nordstroms to buy Prada Candy and the sales woman suggested that I smell the Meow.  Much to my surprise, I fell in love with it and it is now a staple for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my wife a couple of months ago... it legitimately smells great (regardless of whether or not it has Katy Perry&#x27;s name stamped on it) and I love it when she wears it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that, as a man who (with my wife&#x27;s full permission) drools and has terrible naughty thoughts at the sight of Katy Perry, there wasn&#x27;t a picture of her wearing a skin-tight cat-suit on the box that this perfume came in like there is on some of her other fragrances... but I&#x27;ll live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End note: Product highly recommended.</li>
    <li> came shipped on time and the smell of the perfume is to die for i get so many complements on it,  smells wonderful vanilla and ? but it is great.</li>
    <li> I already have the Purr bottle which I adore and now I bougth the Meow kitty perfume and I am so in love with my two cats. Both are delicious, lasting and so sexy perfumes.</li>
