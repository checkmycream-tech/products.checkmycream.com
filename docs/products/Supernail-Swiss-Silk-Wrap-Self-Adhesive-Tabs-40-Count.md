      <li>always keep this product handy in my home manicure station.  </li>

      <li>is perfect for keeping these dust free, clean and on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>THEY FRAY VERY EASILY</li>
      <li>This silk wrap is the best one that I have used thus far.  </li>
      <li>They have worked perfectly for me and even last through a couple of nail polish changes.</li>
      <li>Put two stamps on a package, but better yet, don&#x27;t order from these guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>:)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;hqEkfHBnVfc (there are others too).</li>
      <li>but these pre-cut ones are more convenient</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It works better than the powder repair kids as I have tried them before as well.  </li>
      <li>I also keep some of these in my purse for an emergency fix on the go: looks better than a band-aid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would use more of it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I may adjust that if I just fall in love w/ how this works.</li>
      <li>Also, need more glue on them.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Use with nail glue - smooth before applying polish and nail stays put!</li>
      <li>This product is ok, I was using to try and save split nails.</li>
      <li>Works great on your real nails.</li>
      <li>I suppose if you are experienced at using these they would be a good buy, but the adhesive was so light that they wouldn&#x27;t stick well enough for me to trim them - they just slid off my fingernail.</li>
      <li>With these silk wraps and a bit of fingernail glue; they are as good as new!!</li>
      <li>Very good for classical guitarists!</li>
      <li>Still, I was happy to save 3 nails so far.</li>
      <li>Great product if your nails are brittle or soft.</li>
      <li>I found this product very good it made mending my nails very easy having the slightly self-adhesive backing .</li>
      <li>And be easy taking them off.</li>
      <li>They are easy to apply, have a sticky backing and you can even cut them to size.  </li>
      <li>Easy to place on nails, then add some nail glue.</li>
      <li>It is easy to shape these to your nail</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>They go on easily and smoothly and don&#x27;t show under my manicure.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stay on more than a couple of days, even with liberal doses of super glue.</li>
      <li>Even the smallest size was huge.</li>
      <li>Or maybe it was just the cheap nail polish I was using.  </li>
      <li>It works fabulously for growing out a nail that&#x27;s damaged.</li>
      <li>Overall good product and works much better than sticking a bandaide on your nail until it grows out.</li>
      <li>So far in my try  for repairing my natural nails - this is the best one.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re super light on the nail yet they are strong.</li>
      <li>have now ordered the glue (luckily was available with free shipping).</li>
      <li>These are great to use for nail repair and overlay when your nails are already long.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t a huge issue for me, as my nails grow quickly</li>
      <li>Getting a good result with silk nail wraps definitely requires patience and practice.</li>
      <li>, having had measured before hand, the appropriate size of silk, I remove the backing and apply the wrap close to the cuticle but obviously not on it, making sure to thoroughly cover the split area.  </li>
      <li>My nails seem to like to split across the nail along the side into the quick</li>
      <li>You need nail glue to use these, so if you&#x27;re new to this type of nail repair, you should know that up front (EDITED to remove snark). :)</li>
      <li>I did have to use two pieces because I wanted to be sure it would get me through the upcoming Thanksgiving to New Years holiday season...</li>
      <li>The plus side, I&#x27;m pretty sure I can cut the &amp;#34;thumb&amp;#34; size in HALF, lengthwise, and get even more tabs. :)</li>
      <li>So I revised the review to be much higher than my original estimate.</li>
      <li>I will be back for more!</li>
      <li>I first clean the nail with nail polish remover and I repair the split with brush on glue.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for reappearing split and/or broken nails, allowing you to keep the length while the break grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would be much easier to work with if they were more reasonably shaped.</li>
      <li>again - worth the effort</li>
      <li>, the stuff pops right off your nails.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply and it last for weeks.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, adds a great deal of strength to my thin nails.</li>
      <li>I personally have a bit of a problem finding the perfect size to fit my nail completely from side to side, but as far as repairing the crack and overall strengthening of the nail this is a product worth buying.  </li>
      <li>and I was being very gentle  </li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for something to use for repairing a torn nail, I don&#x27;t recommend this at all -- though I can see how it would work pretty well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also simply used the silk wrap with nail glue and a top coat, which works just as well.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>and I have been able to use smaller pieces of each to reinforce my nail tips.</li>
      <li>* the silk wrap had both cracked in the exact spot where the tear was.  </li>
      <li>You really need to practice a lot in order to get it right</li>
      <li>Also best used if there is only a slight crack in the nail and not too far in or</li>
      <li>My nails are in pretty good shape, but I use these when I get a small tear or break</li>
      <li>So I revised the review to be much higher than my original estimate.to arrive), and it worked really well actually.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised at how effective this silk wrap is, when combined with IBD Brush-On Gel Resin as suggested by other reviews.</li>
      <li>Product works really well for me.</li>
      <li>Instead of applying and filing off the excess, I trim the silk to fit prior to putting it on my nail.</li>
      <li>These silk strips work great for broken nails.  </li>
      <li>These are so much easier to use than the ones that don&#x27;t have any adhesive.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have much difficulty sizing them to my nails and putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so here I am again applying them on each nail so I can get them long and strong</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy I purchased these, and this one little box of wraps will go a very long way.</li>
      <li>My new can&#x27;t live without product!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product! Good company! Thank You!</li>
    <li> This product is to be used with nail glue per the instructions that are INSIDE the plastic container.  This is not noted in the description of the product or on the outside of the product. I wanted an adhesive product that would stay on a few days while a split nail grew out without the bother of nail glue.  So this is not what I was after.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these wraps because they were hard to apply and we difficult to smooth out after they were on.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to apply by myself. It didn&#x27;t stay on more than a couple of days, even with liberal doses of super glue. I have tried acrylics, gels, and now silk wrap to add strength to my weak nail, but I have not yet found satisfaction.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these things!! ;-)</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say is that these wraps are really difficult to apply, I will be giving them away on freecycle.</li>
    <li> This silk wrap is the best one that I have used thus far.  It is very easy to apply and it last for weeks.  When using this product it is best to also purchase a gel brush on glue/resin to bond the silk wraps to your fingernails.  I would highly reccommend this item to every one with natural, brittle, and fragile nails!</li>
    <li> Works great for flamenco guitar players!</li>
    <li> These are so much easier to use than the ones that don&#x27;t have any adhesive. The adhesive is not strong at all, but it is just enough to keep the wrap positioned while you get the glue on it. They have worked perfectly for me and even last through a couple of nail polish changes.</li>
    <li> This is cheaper at Sally&#x27;s.  I tried this several years ago and didn&#x27;t care for it, not easy to apply if you&#x27;re not savvy!  For some reason I felt I should try it again.  I shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> Used this to mend a nail that broke in the middle of the nail bed. It&#x27;s only been a few days, but it&#x27;s still holding strong.</li>
    <li> great product what can i say it came on time and could nt wait to use them with my asp lightless gel kit lasted one month on my nails. i will order again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, wanting to see if this would make my nails stronger.  What I received was the Supernail Nail Bandage, which is like a plastic decal (not the correct size for any of my nails, and not silk at all.  Maybe I should not be reviewing this, since I didn&#x27;t even receive the product I ordered, but this was my experience with Supernail.</li>
    <li> THESE WRAPS ARE STRINGY...HARD TO TRIM AND HARD TO GET INTO PLACE....THEY FRAY VERY EASILY AND LOOK BAD.....HARDLY ANY WAY TO GET THEM TO LOOK NEAT AND I&#x27;VE BEEN DOING NAILS FOR YEARS....</li>
    <li> I purchased these based on the good reviews but I was disappointed.  Although I knew I would have to cut them down, I didn&#x27;t realize just how large they were and it took WAY to much time to create the right sizes (which were never exactly the right sizes). I suppose if your a professional it might be easier but I am not.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I had a torn thumbnail.  After a few practice tries, I was able to get the silk to fit over the whole nail.  Then I applied a couple of layers of nail glue.  Then I buffed, as instructed, and applied several layers of nail polish (I use Opi).  That night when I went to bed, I figured, problem solved.  Next morning when I got up -- and I don&#x27;t know how it happened -- the polish *and* the silk wrap had both cracked in the exact spot where the tear was.  So I tried again, this time with two silk wraps, one on top of the other, followed by at least five coats of polish.  That lasted maybe a couple days.  So if you&#x27;re looking for something to use for repairing a torn nail, I don&#x27;t recommend this at all -- though I can see how it would work pretty well if all you wanted to do was strengthen a nail.  I don&#x27;t think I want to use it for that, though, since it takes soaking your nails in acetone nail polish for ten minutes or so to get the wraps off.  Acetone seems to make my nails split and peel.  Or maybe it was just the cheap nail polish I was using.  I guess I&#x27;ll find out, since I had to use acetone to get the silk wraps off my thumbnail.</li>
    <li> You need nail glue to use these, so if you&#x27;re new to this type of nail repair, you should know that up front (EDITED to remove snark). :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, yes the SIZE of these tabs are RIDICULOUSLY HUGE. Perhaps there should be a &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; version (these) and then a smaller version w/ sizes more in line with smaller fingers. The plus side, I&#x27;m pretty sure I can cut the &amp;#34;thumb&amp;#34; size in HALF, lengthwise, and get even more tabs. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that plastic case is REALLY hard to open, I&#x27;m going to break my nails before I get to protect them w/ these adhesives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you receive: just like the picture shows, it&#x27;s a small, hard plastic case with that little insert (instructions, which mention the need for nail glue), and 40 tabs, 5 different sizes. Yes, they can be cut or filed down in order to fit your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now ordered the glue (luckily was available with free shipping). Will update this review when I actually get to try the product. Very disappointed that these require an extra product in order to use them, and very disappointed in the overly large size (I have tiny nails so I&#x27;m used to having to file things down to fit, but these are ridiculous). So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve given it a low rating. I may adjust that if I just fall in love w/ how this works. We&#x27;ll see ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never done this before, I *highly* recommend watching some youtube videos 1st. :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;hqEkfHBnVfc (there are others too). The videos I&#x27;ve watched have all recommended 3 coats of glue (or resin/activator).  Also be sure you don&#x27;t go to the cuticle with the wrap or the glue; your wrap will lift and it will likely be painful on your cuticle &amp; skin. Finally, this very long video shows how to shape the wrap into a more natural &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; shape so don&#x27;t end up with paddles at the tips of your nails. :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;nfnquiX1-X4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I&#x27;ve tried this product with just clear nail polish (while I waited for the glue to arrive), and it worked really well actually. With just nail polish, it lasted 5 full days, and has saved the broked nail, which is awesome. So I revised the review to be much higher than my original estimate.to arrive), and it worked really well actually. With just nail polish, it lasted 5 full days, and has saved the broked nail, which is awesome. So I revised the review to be much higher than my original estimate.</li>
    <li> these did not work as they say that they should. the adhesive did not stick to my nails like they say they are. Even with extra adhesive i was not able to keep the wrap from moving before the adhesive set.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Easy to use.  Loved the variety of sizes and the quality of the silk.  The adhesive material made it simple to apply.</li>
    <li> junk, did not work at all would never purchase again , waste of money don&#x27;t waste your time, minus stars as far i am concerned</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used wraps before, so it may be &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34; here, but I find these very difficult to apply. The wraps are either way to big for my nails or way too small and it can be a pain cutting every thing to size and getting them to be just so. After only a week, two of my nails are already peeling so I&#x27;m not sure that it is worth the time and effort.</li>
    <li> Easy to place on nails, then add some nail glue. My nails tend to break on the corners, so if that happens, I put  the wrap over that area and then use brush-on nail glue. Next I buff the nail and then apply polish. Product works really well for me. I use this product for repairs and do not use it just to wrap all my nails.</li>
    <li> These are nice, because they already have the adhesive and they&#x27;re pre cut.  I didn&#x27;t have much difficulty sizing them to my nails and putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected.  They started coming off about 1 week later.  This wasn&#x27;t a huge issue for me, as my nails grow quickly and I would&#x27;ve had to reapply anyway to cover the new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I still give these 4 stars for ease of use and because they did help me grow out my nails.</li>
    <li> I had long nails and one cracked but I didn&#x27;t want to file them all even so I put on a bandaid and waited out the two days for this to arrive. My nail was saved. I did have to use two pieces because I wanted to be sure it would get me through the upcoming Thanksgiving to New Years holiday season...and it did!!! Thats quite a long time to have a repair that i never had to touch again except to change the polish. I think that says it all!!!</li>
    <li> Even tho this product is OK, it is very difficult to place it properly on the nail, especially long nails, without air bubbles. You really need to practice a lot in order to get it right</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t needed to use these yet, but upon inspection I found them to be high quality silk wraps.  The shape and self-adhesive option seems to be a big plus.</li>
    <li> Great product if your nails are brittle or soft.Offer sufficient protection from breaks.Very pleased with results.Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I found this product very good it made mending my nails very easy having the slightly self-adhesive backing .</li>
    <li> Will last me a long time, and us also a better and safer alternative to gel and acrylic nails. Happy with this product</li>
    <li> Even the smallest size was huge. Pointless to have in a nail shape being you have to trim so much down (like in half). I have average size hands.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re super light on the nail yet they are strong. I usually file them down before I put on my nail polish and they seem to last from manicure to manicure until the nail chip or split is grown out.</li>
    <li> Great way to fix nails.</li>
    <li> They took a little getting used to applying and there is a time investment - my nails became so long and sexy and were not damaged by the glue - so I decided to do without these because of the time involved and my nails began to peel, break and all that un fun stuff - so here I am again applying them on each nail so I can get them long and strong again - worth the effort and you will save a lot of $$ by doing them yourself</li>
    <li> Getting a good result with silk nail wraps definitely requires patience and practice. If you are willing to put in the time, these can be used as an all-over cover to strengthen weak nails as they grow out. My nails are in pretty good shape, but I use these when I get a small tear or break so I don&#x27;t have to resort to cutting all my nails down. I also keep some of these in my purse for an emergency fix on the go: looks better than a band-aid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are self-adhesive and come in different sizes (most of which are way too big for my nails). Instead of applying and filing off the excess, I trim the silk to fit prior to putting it on my nail. After a coat or two of brush-on glue---and time to allow it to dry completely---it&#x27;s ready for polish. Be careful not to overlap it on your skin or your cuticle, because that can cause it to start lifting away.</li>
    <li> Perfect for reappearing split and/or broken nails, allowing you to keep the length while the break grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To repair a broken nail I first clean the nail with nail polish remover and I repair the split with brush on glue.  I then spray the area with spray on nail glue dryer to instantly dry the glue, saving me some drying time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, having had measured before hand, the appropriate size of silk, I remove the backing and apply the wrap close to the cuticle but obviously not on it, making sure to thoroughly cover the split area.  I make any adjustments if necessary. I then cover the entire silk with brush on glue and I spray the area with nail glue dryer and I repeat another layer of the brush on glue and the nail glue dryer.  Then I gingerly buff the area so as to blend in the silk and glue.  It is virtually invisible but you do have to buff it just enough to blend.  The I wipe the nail with an alcohol swab and I polish my nails as usual and it hold my nail in place for weeks.  At times when I remove my nail polish with nail polish remover, I have to re-apply a thin layer of the brush on glue to re-enforce the repair but its not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are easy to place on nails and the little plastic box they come in is perfect for keeping these dust free, clean and on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other silk wraps for repairing split nails, the ones that are not pre-cut, and they work fine but these pre-cut ones are more convenient I find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this product for repairs, I do not use it just to wrap all my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always keep this product handy in my home manicure station.  Highly recommend them for repairs.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell from the picture what quantity of silk tips I was getting (but it looked like a lot) and the description had no info. I found the SAME PRODUCT - EXACTLY - at a local beauty supply place for $3.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Amazon wanted to charge $4.98 for return shipping!!!! PLEASE. Put two stamps on a package, but better yet, don&#x27;t order from these guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product. Completely outrageous pricing.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, adds a great deal of strength to my thin nails. I have finally found a solution to breakage!</li>
    <li> Difficult to apply, but they work great.</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly for mending a couple of cracked nails that I had.  Before I would just cut all of my nails short after a broken nail.  These allow me to grow out the broken nail and keep the rest of my nails long.</li>
    <li> When I have had splits and cracks in my nails, I have been using this product to prevent me from cutting them completely down.  I was skeptical at first since I have had bad experience repairing already damaged nails.  They never seemed to hold up past 2 days.  But with the silk, they are so durable and lasts even after I use nail polish remover weekly to prepare for my next manicure.  My new can&#x27;t live without product!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these for repairs. Great with gel nails for strength.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, I was using to try and save split nails. Perhaps that is not what product is intended for. I m not into wearing fake nails, this seems like it would be a better alternative if you want to take the time to apply.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this product and would use again.  It took a few tries to get it to fit on my nail properly and not stick or be bumpy. Also best used if there is only a slight crack in the nail and not too far in or the nail will just continue to break anyway.  Once you get the hang of it and apply polish, cannot tell there is anything there.  Overall good product and works much better than sticking a bandaide on your nail until it grows out.</li>
    <li> In the past, when my nail ripped, I used a combination of basecoat and tea bags to fix the rip temporarily. Putting polish over it always made the nail look wide and lumpy, no matter how carefully I filed it down and how good it looked sans polish. After a few days, the tea bag always ripped and I had to remove all polish and repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plus the bondini nail glue on Amazon has helped me fix nail rips in a way that has lasted for over a week. I want to change my nail polish colors before this fix loses its grip at all. I don&#x27;t know why all the nail sites even mention tea bags when this exists as a solution.</li>
    <li> its okay if you know how to use it, but its not too complicated.</li>
    <li> Hard to peel off backing, and cut to size.Medical tape works just as well, and not as expensive.</li>
    <li> These silk strips work great for broken nails.  They are easy to apply, have a sticky backing and you can even cut them to size.  Use with nail glue - smooth before applying polish and nail stays put!</li>
    <li> I suppose if you are experienced at using these they would be a good buy, but the adhesive was so light that they wouldn&#x27;t stick well enough for me to trim them - they just slid off my fingernail.</li>
    <li> I guess I need to read the directions.  These are not &amp;#34;tabs&amp;#34; nor are they self-adhesive.  Was I sent the wrong product?</li>
    <li> I had three cracks to mend, two on one nail, and one crack on another. One tab was enough to mend ll three cracks. I used this product in conjunction with IBD Gel Resin, found here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UBMC3O/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1. I&#x27;m a nail blogger, and change my polish daily, sometimes more than once, and in the three days I&#x27;ve been using them, I&#x27;ve had at least five polish changes. Not only are my patch jobs holding up, but you can&#x27;t tell they&#x27;re there at all, even when I choose lighter colors. I&#x27;m happy I purchased these, and this one little box of wraps will go a very long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a musician and play in a finger-picking style. I use these to repair splits and cracks on my nails - they&#x27;re fairly easy to apply, last well and help prevent further splitting.</li>
    <li> My nails seem to like to split across the nail along the side into the quick (I do use my hands a lot). With these silk wraps and a bit of fingernail glue; they are as good as new!! Keeps my manicure looking fabulous!!</li>
    <li> Nothing like silk wraps to patch a break.  Without them I would have stubs instead of nails.  Easy to use.  And it works.</li>
    <li> These are great to use for nail repair and overlay when your nails are already long. For short nails using as tip be ready to apply maybe 10 coats of glue to use with it to make it thick enough to avoid chipping and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finished product of silk wrap but began to chip after a week. I used it with the brush on nail glue.</li>
    <li> So far in my try  for repairing my natural nails - this is the best one. l tried some others (self adhesive type &amp;#34;bandaids&amp;#34; for your nails that didn&#x27;t work at all) but these ones seem to be working well.</li>
    <li> These silk wraps are great. You can use the presized self adhesive wraps to cover an entire nail, or you can cut what you need for a break or crack. I do acrygel, which is a UV gel base with acrylic powder on top and cured. I do this for breaks or cracks. It works fabulously for growing out a nail that&#x27;s damaged. I&#x27;ve also simply used the silk wrap with nail glue and a top coat, which works just as well. I like a longer lasting fix, or strengthener, say 3 weeks. But with nail glue these stay on for 1-2 weeks. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works great on your real nails. Beautian showed me how to use this and it works good. I would use more of it.</li>
    <li> As a person with small finger nails I need to cut these down in width. Does not include nail glue so grab that, a buffer block, small scissors and a nail file. Take your time! And be easy taking them off. I destroyed a few nails because I was impatient!</li>
    <li> I love this product. feels like i have a salon in my house.</li>
    <li> I use these to protect that one nail that won&#x27;t stop splitting no matter what I put on it. There&#x27;s lots of product here and since I only use a tiny bit, this will probably last me forever. I use this with a brush on glue I got at CVS. Needs replacing periodically. I soak it off with acetone and reapply. The glue makes the silk virtually disappear so that it doesn&#x27;t even look like there&#x27;s anything there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would suggest....don&#x27;t try to use this after you&#x27;ve applied lotion or the silk won&#x27;t stick to the nail.</li>
    <li> These stay on and protect my nails allowing me to go for over a week between manicures.  They also protect my nails from breaking when doing chores. They go on easily and smoothly and don&#x27;t show under my manicure.  For added endurance, I attach with a nail glue.</li>
    <li> awful, they tear as you are trying to put them on nail and I was being very gentle  need to be stronger</li>
    <li> extremely thin fabric makes it hard to apply</li>
    <li> Great stuff, this silk wrap for nails. I&#x27;m hoping it will prevent my nails from breaking off after a split.</li>
    <li> Meh.  Please don&#x27;t believe the &amp;#34;stick on&amp;#34; label.  It doesn&#x27;t at all.  Further, I had to cut down all the wraps except for on my thumb nails.  they were 1/8&amp;#34; too wide.  You apply them and use nail glue to put them in place.  The idea is to keep your nails from splitting or chipping, so I was all YAYHOO! NO MORE SPLITS!  Well, by four hours later, I had the tips chipped off my nails, and one had delaminated/split.  I was careful to have the glue and wraps extend to the edge of my nails, too.  Not only that, the stuff pops right off your nails.  Nail polish remover won&#x27;t dissolve it, but you can chip it with little effort.  After the first nail came off, I removed all of the wraps that way in ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;All that said, it might just be my lack of skill at fault here.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Learned how to use them on YouTube and I&#x27;m hooked!  A must-have for emergencies!!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. The slight tackiness makes application much easier. It is easy to shape these to your nail and I have been able to use smaller pieces of each to reinforce my nail tips. I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how effective this silk wrap is, when combined with IBD Brush-On Gel Resin as suggested by other reviews. Once cured and sanded down, the patched area looks like the rest of my nail, albeit a bit thicker, of course. This is a great product for repairing cracked and chipped nails. Very good for classical guitarists!</li>
    <li> These worked well repairing a torn nail.  I used with a nail repair &amp;#34;resin&amp;#34; I also bought on Amazon, which is really the equivalent of crazy glue, but easier to apply because it has a brush. I personally have a bit of a problem finding the perfect size to fit my nail completely from side to side, but as far as repairing the crack and overall strengthening of the nail this is a product worth buying.  It is completely necessary to get a resin or crazy glue to properly use this product.  It may state that on the description, but if it does not, please know that you must buy a crazy glue or the resin (which I personally like) to have this product work the way it is intended.  It works better than the powder repair kids as I have tried them before as well.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Hard to use, and pop off after 4to 5 days and u have ti do it all over again.</li>
    <li> broken nail as good as the others, like this product</li>
    <li> These work to support glue in repairing natural nails. But - they are sized for Amazon woman finger nails. Only the very smallest ones will work for my nails. All the others must be cut down. I am giving it a 3 because I think the size is too little far out. Would be much easier to work with if they were more reasonably shaped. Also, need more glue on them. Still, I was happy to save 3 nails so far.</li>
