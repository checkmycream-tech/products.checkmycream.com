      <li>ORIGINAL.  </li>
      <li>I was right!</li>
      <li>I thought it is a great cologne for the money I&#x27;ve spent for it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Actually, don&#x27;t buy this, because there should only be one man who smells this good: me.</li>
      <li>I love Chrome its a light clean scent that&#x27;s not over powering I spray one time on my shirt and go pretty much all day with the scent on me</li>
      <li>Shipping was really fast!!</li>
      <li>Here you can enter the batch code on the bottom of your bottle to see when it was made and how fresh it is.</li>
      <li>This took me a lot of work and chance to make sure it&#x27;s right because I got the 6.8 Oz bottle for $53.28, so I wanted to save all of you the time I spent and make your life easier.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also has a reasonable price</li>
      <li>I have to give that much.</li>
      <li>Got mines today so far what I seen it&#x27;s a real fragrance and not a fake.</li>
      <li>Love this cologne, very good price... always hard to tell if online colognes last as long as they typically should... seems like they don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Yes, 6.8 oz was a huge jar, but not worth the money.</li>
      <li>B00BOHHH68 under PRODUCT DETAILS, instead of the old</li>
      <li>My husband was running low of this same exact cologne</li>
      <li>my previous cologne was Dolce&amp;gabbana Light Blue</li>

    <li> Shipping was really fast!! My husband loves this and the price can not be beat!</li>
    <li> Got mines today so far what I seen it&#x27;s a real fragrance and not a fake.</li>
    <li> I thought it is a great cologne for the money I&#x27;ve spent for it. I always get compliments on this cologne.</li>
    <li> Spray it in your hair, spray it on your junk, brush your teeth with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, don&#x27;t buy this, because there should only be one man who smells this good: me.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast I have to give that much. Product was too good to be true. Yes, 6.8 oz was a huge jar, but not worth the money. The scent was so weak and not long lasting how it should be. My husband was running low of this same exact cologne so I figure why not and now I regret this purchase. Never will I buy cologne from here again. Just stick to department store when it comes to things like this.</li>
    <li> The best cologne money can buy. One spray is all you need. All My Bitches Love Me. Try it out</li>
    <li> READ if you hate receiving old batches of cologne! This is how you check!&lt;br /&gt;Batch code  208113&lt;br /&gt;Production date 2012-08&lt;br /&gt;Shelf life  5 years&lt;br /&gt;Expiry date  2017-08&lt;br /&gt;Notes the codes are repeated every 10 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st of all, there are 2 versions of this on Amazon Prime shipped from the warehouse. I chose the more expensive one because I thought it&#x27;d be a newer batch. I was right! To check when your bottle was produced aka \\&quot;shelf life\\&quot;, go to [...] Here you can enter the batch code on the bottom of your bottle to see when it was made and how fresh it is. This is my info off the bottle I just received today, Nov 14th, 2013. The difference is this bottle was like $8 more, and this bottle had ASIN: B00BOHHH68 under PRODUCT DETAILS, instead of the old so make sure yours has that ASIN. This took me a lot of work and chance to make sure it&#x27;s right because I got the 6.8 Oz bottle for $53.28, so I wanted to save all of you the time I spent and make your life easier. Smellin fresh, enjoy peoples! Please rate my review so it can help many others, thanks!</li>

INFELIZMENTE NÃO D&amp;Aacute; PARA DEVOLVER, J&amp;Aacute; VOLTEI PARA O MEU PA&amp;Iacute;S. NÃO COMPRO MAIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE CHROME AZZARO TO MANY YEARS AND THIS PRODUCT IS NOT ORIGINAL. IN LESS THAN ONE HOUR OF USE THE PRODUCT EXHIBITS. I&#x27;M DISAPPOINTED. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN NOT RETURN, I&#x27;VE ALREADY COME BACK TO MY COUNTRY. I DO NOT BUY MORE.</li>
