<li> This cream is definitely designed for people with dry to normal skin.  </li>
<li> I was afraid to use it at first because there is a mild fragrance (which can irritate me), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate my skin after months of use.  </li>
<li> I recommended this product to a friend who is a couple of years younger than me and was also experiencing that dry, thinning skin that comes with aging.</li>
<li> I bought this while on vacation in Vegas as I had gotten extreme wind burn on my face during an open air scooter excursion through Red Rock Canyon.  </li>
<li> I got this because I live in the desert and my skin is super dry during winter, which makes me crazy.</li>
<li> Thus I bought Vichy( the heavy one) in case that my sensitive skin gets allergic.</li>
<li> This lotion helped me through dry summer</li>
<li> The weather in my place is extremely dry.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t just use it on my face, but have found that it works well for dry spots on my hands too.  </li>
<li> but I started to get dry this winter.  </li>
<li> I refuse to go a single day without using it.</li>
<li> Also, I would like to point out that I&#x27;m still using the same jar I initially purchased and still have enough to use for at least another 4-6 weeks.</li>
<li> So, while it may seem a bit expensive it&#x27;s really not because it&#x27;s so rich and works</li>
<li> I have very dry and flaky skin on my face</li>
<li> It is think which helps with very dry spots or for winter weather.  </li>
<li> I even gave her enough of mine to use for a few days</li>
<li> A bit expensive but worth the price.</li>
<li> It also keeps me from getting those rough, dry patches that are common for rosacea and/or eczema sufferers during the winter months or in a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;</li>
<li> I have a very dry skin, plus I&#x27;m a redhead, so my skin is very thin and sensitive.</li>
<li> I used the La Roche Posay Effaclair which really dried up my skin.</li>
<li> and I just got a new one because it&#x27;s getting cold.</li>
<li> Difficult skin that gets dry even though it&#x27;s still oily in my T zone :/.</li>

    <li> decent moisturizer but the intense smell of hairspray makes me choose another brand</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream..it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for to heal my dry skin. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this face cream, I am a male that used Bobbi Brown&#x27;s face cream until this was discovered. This is my permanent replacement for the product, and at 1/3 the cost!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, rosacea and eczema.  If I don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; products on my skin, it will be bright red, with bumps and blotchy areas - as well as sensitive to the touch.

It also keeps me from getting those rough, dry patches that are common for rosacea and/or eczema sufferers during the winter months or in a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Rich, creamy, fast-absorbing, non-irritating, soothing.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tad of background on me:  I&#x27;m 39, diagnosed with rosacea in 2004, very fair skin/coloring, extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this moisturizer by the beauty tech at a local pharmacy. I have very dry and flaky skin on my face so I use this and the Thermal Spa Water cleanser also from Vichy. I really do like how this product makes my face feel exfoliated and hydrated, however it contains quite a bit of fragrance which makes my face burn like hell when I apply it and for some time after. I&#x27;ll get through these bottles because I paid for them but I would not recommend this for skin sensitive to fragrance.</li>
    <li> A light but creamy moisturizer which protects my face all day and helps  keep my make-up on all day as well.</li>
    <li> Love this cream very much. You can see effect right away The skin became soft, light exactly as describe by Vichy. This is a must for every day, does moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Good choice for sensetive skin</li>
    <li> I bought this while on vacation in Vegas as I had gotten extreme wind burn on my face during an open air scooter excursion through Red Rock Canyon.  Went to the drug store and asked the beauty consultant to recommend a really good moisturizer.  I could not use the first one he suggested due to the sunscreen ingredients so he recommended this.  Within 24 hours my face is moisturized and the windburn skin has been exfoliated.  My face is very sensitive to lotions and this has caused me no problems.  I paid an inflated price on the Vegas Strip, but I feel it was well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I got it very fast. I kind of like the feeling after you put it on. Buy I can not tell how good it is because I have not used for long yet.</li>

    <li> love it! love the smell!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and love the cool feeling it gives me. Honestly this really does moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and arrived before expected. I am absolutely amazed with this product. I used the La Roche Posay Effaclair which really dried up my skin. This moisturizer from Vichy was heaven sent.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream&amp;#62;  It gives a nice glow to my skin and doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I would recommend this to all women.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry skin, plus I&#x27;m a redhead, so my skin is very thin and sensitive. This lotion helped me through dry summer and I just got a new one because it&#x27;s getting cold. So far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Super rich cream, scent is very &amp;#34;elegant&amp;#34; like something you would pick up at Macy&#x27;s.  I still notice that it doesn&#x27;t relieve the flakiness around my nose but maybe, I need an even richer cream.  This cream is definitely designed for people with dry to normal skin.  Don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;ve got oily skin.  Combination skins could give it a try (like I am, but I am more leaning to dry). This is also more for night time use, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the day as it is very thick.</li>
    <li> I Love it, my skin is very dry, but with this product it stays hydrated and soft. Brightens my skin, not heavy.</li>
    <li> I used Vichy ever since I was back home in Europe. I moved to the States and none of the creams I tried worked for my skin. I was ecstatic when I found them on Amazon - a bit of background info - I&#x27;m 30 and have combination skin. Difficult skin that gets dry even though it&#x27;s still oily in my T zone :/. This cream works wonders - it gives me the moisture I need without getting my face greasy and making me break out. Terrific product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  A bit expensive but worth the price.</li>
    <li> Refresh your face and non grease</li>
    <li> very watering and I love it</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is think which helps with very dry spots or for winter weather.  I don&#x27;t just use it on my face, but have found that it works well for dry spots on my hands too.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores which is a major plus as well.</li>
    <li> I  have very dry and very allergenic skin,VICHY product  are perfect for me.Thanks</li>
    <li> As always, Vichy you are the best!</li>
    <li> I have used Lancome  Absolute for a long time but I started to get dry this winter.  I bought this one for winter. Not greasy at all and keeps my skin comfortable all day.</li>
    <li> I love it , my skin looks younger</li>
    <li> It is working for me!</li>
    <li> I can feel it soaking into my skin right away.  The texture of the cream is very soothing.  The scent is clean and fresh  I went through this last winter in Chicago (or Chiberia as we say) and the cream was definitely up to the task.</li>
    <li> It was wonderful. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight,effective moisturizer and my dry skin loves it.As usual,Vichy products do not disappoint.In about to finish the first aqualia thermal  and will definitely repurchase.Very subtle pleasant scent,does not leave skin oilish,but keeps it moisturized throughout the day.Great for my very 30 some years old sensitive skin,witch is showing the first signs of aging.</li>
    <li> The weather in my place is extremely dry. Thus I bought Vichy( the heavy one) in case that my sensitive skin gets allergic. You could feel that your skin is feeding water. Good but not for oil skin and summer time!</li>
    <li> Definitely a great moisturizer, keeps face moist the entire day.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Does an excellent job of moisturizing my mature, dry skin, it absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, my skin is extremely smooth and soft, and the moisturizer smells wonderful. The moisturizer arrived very quickly and on time and was nicely packaged. I would recommend this product 100%. In fact, I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several friends and family members.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day for three months now and continue to absolutely love it. Also, I would like to point out that I&#x27;m still using the same jar I initially purchased and still have enough to use for at least another 4-6 weeks. So, while it may seem a bit expensive it&#x27;s really not because it&#x27;s so rich and works so well that you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it. My 60-year old skin has improved tremendously since I started using this. Tiny, fine lines caused by dry skin have disappeared and my skin feels so soft, silky and hydrated. I refuse to go a single day without using it. I recommended this product to a friend who is a couple of years younger than me and was also experiencing that dry, thinning skin that comes with aging. I even gave her enough of mine to use for a few days so she could try it out for herself before spending any money. She liked it so well that she purchased her own jar and is just as pleased and thrilled with it as I am.</li>
    <li> This is one of  my favorite moisturizers, love the smell and it comes straight from Greece!!</li>
