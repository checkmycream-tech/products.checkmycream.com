    <li> Was a little skeptical as the price was lower than others. But took a chance and bought it. Fits perfectly with a round base styling chair and the quality is quite nice. Feels great to stand on and has a great low profile edge so hair and debris doesn&#x27;t find their way under the mat.</li>
    <li> good quality, ordered 1 more.</li>
    <li> I bought these for two salons I own.  After just a few months the edges peel upward causing a trip hazard for both the stylist and the customer.  I even tried tapping them down, that too did not work.  I would not buy these.</li>
    <li> I think these are great! I bought 2 for my stations they are big but I love them :) my legs don&#x27;t hurt at the end of the day like they were!</li>
