<li> This is a large shower sponge that hits almost my entire back without any trouble at all.  </li>
<li> Very little nylon mesh which was loosely tied together with cotton twine; it snapped during the first use.</li>
<li> Looks like it will last for a long time ....</li>
<li> Too bad, it looked nice.</li>
<li> i found it was not effective as it did not unfold enough for scrubbing the back.  </li>
<li> It was also a little rough on the skin.</li>
<li> Would give negative stars on product and vendor if possible.</li>
<li> I like the feel of this Back Scrubber not to stiff or hard on my skin.</li>
<li> As others have mentioned, this is a cheap bit of crap that will fall apart on you after just a few uses.  </li>
<li> And unfortunately, this product is no bigger and no better than the ones I bought at the dollar store.</li>
<li> not sure how it&#x27;s falling apart for others</li>
<li> Unfortunately there were no dimensions of this product.</li>

    <li> started coming apart after first use</li>
    <li> Fell apart after only one shower</li>
    <li> Fell apart on first use. Junk.  Would give negative stars on product and vendor if possible.</li>
    <li> I now can reach areas that I could not before. I like the feel of this Back Scrubber not to stiff or hard on my skin. Looks like it will last for a long time .... good purchase well worth the price. The delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Very little nylon mesh which was loosely tied together with cotton twine; it snapped during the first use. This is dollar store quality -- if that.</li>
    <li> These are my husbands favorite.  They&#x27;re not meant to last for years.  They&#x27;ve lasted for several months, so I think they hold up fine.</li>
    <li> This is a large shower sponge that hits almost my entire back without any trouble at all.  I&#x27;ve had it a few months now and it is holding up fine.</li>
    <li> i love this so much. not sure how it&#x27;s falling apart for others but i&#x27;ve been using this for about a couple months now and it&#x27;s the greatest scrubber ever. the straps are elastic so it does stretch for people with big backs or short arms. personally this is the best scrubber i have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> yes, used it on a snow day...when i recovered out of the tub..llookedoutside..there was SNOW all around, its magic a scrubber</li>

    <li> Great shower sponges.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately there were no dimensions of this product. And unfortunately, this product is no bigger and no better than the ones I bought at the dollar store. Would not recommend this product. Same money and buy from your local store.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Cleans without being too scratchy</li>
    <li> One of the two back scrubbers I purschased fell apart when I removed them from the shipping package. I would not recomend this item</li>
    <li> My husband loves this sponge he is able to wash his back in the shower with the rope on each end for and easy grip.</li>
    <li> Bought this through eBay for 5.00.  Same company provided it.  Have been looking all over for a back scrubber like this one so I was really excited.  Second shower and the end &#x27;puff&#x27; thing with it&#x27;s handle fell off.  Can&#x27;t reattach it because the strings are so short.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/22/2013&lt;br /&gt;Went through Buyer Protection on eBay and got my money back.  Found the same item at Rite Aide for same price and it is doing just fine.  No more dealings with All Top Bargains.</li>
    <li> The ultimate shower sponge</li>
    <li> Nice back scrubber that fits in my gym bag!  Some said that it fell apart after a short time but mine has been just fine. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Fell apart on first use.</li>
    <li> string broke after first use</li>
