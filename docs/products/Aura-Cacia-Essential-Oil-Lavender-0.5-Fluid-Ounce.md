<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only other brand of lavender I&#x27;ve used is doterra. I could put three drops in my bath and my entire bathroom would smell like lavender an hour later. I can put 6 drops of this in a bath and I can no longer smell it by the time i turn the water off. I&#x27;ve tried diffusing it as well and can&#x27;t even smell it all the way through the room. With other brands I can smell them all the way through the house within 15 minutrs. Very disappointed. I&#x27;ve also ordered two of their blends. Maybe they will be different. Wish I had waited.</li>
    <li> The best and purest lavender oil around!</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful, and I use it daily in my dispenser.</li>
    <li> Lavender is the BEST!!</li>
    <li> Smells great! I mix around 20 drops with distilled water and a bit of witch hazel for a general fabric freshener. It&#x27;s also great a good spray to put on your pillow before bed...great for relaxing! I sometimes put a few drops in the tub, but it&#x27;s a little oily.</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought it to go along with my peppermint oil that I already haveto help with my migraines as I am trying to cut down on the pharmaceticals I have to ingest. I am tired of taking pills, so I am looking for alternatives, and the combination of peppermint and lavender is a well-known combo to combat migraines. It really does help if I get to it in time, and it is much less troublesome than taking a bunch of pills inf ront of my students and looking like a pill-popper to them.</li>
    <li> super fast shipping! LOVE IT! one of my fav scents!</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is alright.  I&#x27;ve tried worse and I&#x27;ve tried better.</li>
    <li> The Best Lavendel Oil Ever!!!</li>
    <li> I love it, okay?&lt;br /&gt;I have an unhealthy addiction to lavender.&lt;br /&gt;YOU get over it.</li>
    <li> Very small amount for the price</li>
    <li> My grandma buys these oils at her local health store, but they&#x27;re cheaper here, so I decided to purchase the lavender scent to save money. However, the oil did spill a little (not too much, just up to the top of the label under the cap) so that&#x27;s why I have it three stars. It wasn&#x27;t a lot and I primarily use it for aromatherapy so it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described and is excellent quality</li>
    <li> I have used other products from Aura Cacia and they are all outstanding products as is this Lavender!</li>
    <li> This smells AMAZING! I put some into my fragrance-free conditioner, and my hair smells like lavender- wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I use it for many different things: add to moisturizer to help clear up breakouts fast, add some to my garbage disposal so it smells better, add a few drops to my pillow before bed to help me sleep, use it on my wrists as a perfume, rub a little on my forehead to help with motion sickness. It smells amazing! After a few weeks I am almost done with my first bottle and will definitely be buying more. Also it shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Love this lavender oil! I use it everyday. Very good scent!!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality lavender. The whole transaction was a good and smooth experience.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  I use at bedtime on my neck and shoulders.  I also put a few drops in the bath.</li>
    <li> This oil did not smell like lavender at all.  Doesn&#x27;t necessarily have a bad odor, but it is nothing like lavender in my opinion.  I have had better luck with another brand.  I&#x27;m new to this brand and really like the orange so I don&#x27;t want to discourage people to not order from this company.</li>
    <li> The top was kind of difficult to take off and it leaks a little. When my bottle arrived, the box was full of fragrance and the oil only filled the bottle to the top of the label. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s how it was supposed to be or if it leaked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great. I mixed 5 drops with 1/4 cup of coconut oil to use as an ointment for a raw nose when I had a cold.</li>
    <li> I love this lavender essential oil.  It is great quality and does not seem diluted in any way.  You can use this oil in so many ways, I love to put drops of the oil in my bathtub and sit and soak in the tub with it...so relaxing.  My favorite is it put some drops of lavender oil directly on my skin before bed time, and it always helps me relax and get to sleep in no time.  I only have good things to say about this oil.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smells just as it should and is perfect in our diffuser as a nighttime solution.</li>
    <li> This smelled totally different than the aura cacia lavender that I buy at my local health food store</li>
    <li> A lovely oil at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Smells sweet and light but still potent.</li>
    <li> it is just great. you should study all the things it is good for.</li>
    <li> adds a light pleasant smell to my homemade face wash</li>
    <li> It smells like lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No actually it&#x27;s the only kind I buy now. I&#x27;ve bought other kinds and this is the best. I don&#x27;t know what else I can say about it. It&#x27;s certainly relaxing, but not sure if that isn&#x27;t because I associate the smell of lavender with aromatherapy massages.</li>
    <li> Product not properly sealed! It arrived to us in a lavender-oil soaked box with 1/3 of the bottle empty! Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Box smells damn soothing though.</li>
    <li> Heaven in a bottle this works great when you make it  into a spray and throw some drops into your lotion.</li>
    <li> I like the scent but price was high, I can get it cheaper in the health food store</li>
    <li> Only recently did I start using essential oils in cool mist diffusers. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands and scents, and so far this Aura Cacia lavender is my favorite. I&#x27;m well familiar with Aura Cacia from the many years that I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores in SF and later in the Midwest, starting in the late seventies. Aura Cacia is a well-established company that started in 1982, with an excellent reputation in the industry, I have complete faith in the brand, and their lavender essential oil does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drops in a diffuser yields a great scent, a scent which I can favorably compare to that of the lavender I grow in my herb garden. I find the scent of Aura Cacia lavender essential oil calming and relaxing and when I use it at bedtime, sleep inducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aura Cacia was acquired by Frontier Co-op in 1993. Frontier is another great, well-established company with an excellent reputation in the natural food/wellness industry (Frontier started in 1976). I stress the fact that Aura Cacia is well-established because nowadays there are many essential oil brands in the marketplace, many of which are offered by companies about which it can be difficult if not impossible to find information on. Ideally, before I buy an essential oil I want to know that it&#x27;s coming from an established, trustworthy source. Aura Cacia is such a source.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this essential oil in lavender!  I sprinkle some on my pillow for a restful nights sleep....better than any sleeping pill, and no side effects!  The ingredients in this product are pure and of excellent quality. I e been using this product for a couple years and was delighted to find it on amazon, and at a lower price.</li>
    <li> Love this oil - great for diffusing at nighttime, smells very good.</li>
    <li> Good fragrance.  A bit pricey for a small amount.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using aura cacia oils for years....I also like their blends. They make a Quality product with a fair price.</li>
    <li> I have anxiety and use this on rough nights when I&#x27;m trying to relax. I put a couple drops on wrist, temples, forehead, belly button. The smells is very calming, relaxing, and makes me smile. I also like using it in an oil diffuser and on candles. Anddddd I like to massage it into my hair. :-) love it</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia is a decent brand, and this is a good quality oil. Not the highest quality out there, but the value for the price is dead-on and this is perfect for skincare and aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> Lavender EO&#x27;s vary SOOO greatly in scent, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to know if it&#x27;ll be the nice relaxing floral scent or more like something nauseating scenting your Gramma&#x27;s sock drawer. This stuff is my favorite lavender EO by far, and my massage clients go crazy for it. It&#x27;s super relaxing, strong enough to smell, but light enough that it doesn&#x27;t give you a headache. You can&#x27;t miss with Aura Cacia.</li>
    <li> Loved the essential oil-made &amp;#34;Hot Sacks&amp;#34;-flannel bags filled with flax seed that can be used chilled or heated in the microwave for headaches,&lt;br /&gt;strained muscles, or just comfort for Christmas presents-add the lavender essential oils and they are wonderfully fragrant. A really big hit by&lt;br /&gt;my family!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product of consistently high quality.  Great for sprinkling in closets to keep away bugs or using in bedrooms for a calming effect to soothe yourself or others to sleep.  Aura Cacia is highly respected and has been around a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this essential oil in my bath at night. It is very fragrant and relaxing. I like this brand because of its high quality. The scent is wonderful, and it does the job. When I feel extra stressed, I will put a couple of drops on a bath cloth and put it on the armrest of the couch while I&#x27;m reading.</li>
    <li> High quality oil at a fair price. Aura Cacia is my go to brand and would recommend it to anyone. The smell is sweet and diffuses so well. I also mix it to make mosquito repellant. It&#x27;s was packaged well and arrived at my doorstep in the same condition is expect if I purchased at my local health food store</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy the other brands.  Pay the extra and buy this one.  I bought a cheaper brand and the oil doesn&#x27;t even smell like lavender!  I&#x27;ll be going back to Aura Cacia!</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia is my go-to brand for most of my essential oils .Lavender ,in particular, is the one I buy most often. Lavender oil is one of the most versatile of oils and has many  uses .I use mine in the bathtub, combined with baking soda and epsom salt for an incredibly relaxing and detoxifying bath (I found this remedy in Mark Hyman&#x27;s, &amp;#34;The Ultra Simple Diet&amp;#34; book -a book worth checking out,by the way! ) It can also be sprinkled onto the shower walls prior to a hot shower (an amazing DIY mini-spa experience ! ), sprinkled onto your pillow at night (only a couple of drops,as it&#x27;s quite potent) to help you drift into a peaceful sleep,dabbed on your wrists as an all natural, calming and soothing  perfume , used in sachets or simply sprinkled onto a paper towel and put into your drawers and hampers to keep your clothes  fresh-smelling,dabbed on burns and bug bites to reduce inflammation ,mixed with a base vegetable or nut oil  and applied topically to help heal  skin conditions(psoriasis,eczema,and dermatitis),mixed with olive oil as a skin moisturizer,added to water and sprayed on your body (and even around doors and windows) to help repel insects naturally,sprinkled onto dried leaves and flowers for an all natural,non-toxic, homemade potpourri ,added to facial toner or cream to help alleviate acne, and as an aid to nosebleeds and motion sickness-this is by no means comprehensive list! The thing that I like best about the Aura Cacia brand is its potent,yet natural smelling scent;I&#x27;ve had bottles of this for years that have retained their aroma and efficacy.I highly recommend Aura Cacia Lavender oil.</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia makes a very good Lavender Oil--this smells fresh and alive, not preserved and chemical, as with some brands.  Add this little bottle to their aluminum lavender spritzer and spray it all over your bed before you go to sleep.  Not a cure for insomnia, but definitely a lovely add.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years in my moisturizing lotion.  Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. So far I have used the oil for room fragrence, on eczema(with coconut as carier oil), and to freshen my laundry in the dryer balls I use. I am happy with it, but have never used another brand. The price vs. quality seems perfect, I am very happy with the price I paid and think the quality is great. I have a friend who has access to another theraputic grade brand of oils and am not even tempted to pay an extra $10 for the oils she can purchase. The best thing is the packaging gives use and mixing instructions so you know exactly how to get the most of the oil. I ordered another oil from my friend and had to referr to the packaging in the Aura Cacia brand for instructions on mixing (because you cannot put these oils directly on skin&#x3D; irritation).</li>
    <li> Does not smell anything close to lavender.  It smells like rancid oil.  It&#x27;s a bummer that i can&#x27;t return it.  waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> Lavender essential oil can be used for so many things. It is good for burns, massage, baths, stress, acne, insomnia and depression. It helps the skin heal faster and seems to actually prevent breakouts from even occuring if you apply it directly in time. If you have trouble sleeping you can put some of this oil on your pillow case. It can also promote a feeling of well being when burned in an oil burner. Aura Cacia is now selling this in a box for some reason. In the box they include a pamphlet that describes other essential oils. There is also a dollar off coupon for your next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I need it for my big, boil-like acne that keeps on growing on my chin. I apply through the day, neat, the next day, my acne has shrunk tremendously.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with this brand. Consistent, high quality product.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST lavender essential oil that I have found. I use it on my eye mask at night to help me sleep and I also use it when I make soap. This is the real deal!!!</li>
    <li> I received the product but was only filled to under the label. It smells lovely , but I didn&#x27;t realize I didn&#x27;t purchase the Organic Lavender Oil. It came in a aura Cacia white box without a plastic seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated it 5 stars as I usually buy from my local health food store.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. Fill up a big spray bottle full of water, put in 100 drops of this and mist my sheets and pillowcases after I put them on my bed. Smells incredible.</li>
    <li> Lavendar oil works great for many uses.  Mosquito bites, burns, to relaxing.</li>
    <li> I love Aura Casia! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Essential and potent with a great price tag!  Long-lasting, not watered down.  Thankyou.</li>
    <li> You must buy this!  SSSOOO amazing! Excellent quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box it says: origin: Ukraine and/or Bulgaria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it diluted with distilled water and a drop of vodka for room deodorizer. the NATURAL way.&lt;br /&gt;can also be use as linen spray! works GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product from a reputable company. I&#x27;ve been buying Aura Cacia products for many years. And they never disappoint. I always try to save money and in the past have bought other lavender essential oils for less. It has never been worth it. One time I ended up getting a very week/diluted form of lavender oil with (I guess) a carrier oil. But the fact that the product was diluted was not disclosed online or in the packaging. Another time I received something that smelled faintly like lavender and strongly of something very bitter and &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying that no other company out there distributes great essential oils, I am just saying &amp;#34;buying beware&amp;#34; if you are considering trying other brands.&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact I very recently discovered another company here on Amazon that makes fantastic EO blends! (But I will continue to get my basics from Aura Casia) -- but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;Aura Cacia&#x27;s lavender essential oil is great. You can diffuse it, dilute in a carrier oil for massage or a bath or add it to spray bottle with distilled water to make your own room or relaxing linen spray at a great price. I have insomnia and seem to be perpetually stress, and I find this essential oil very soothing. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Seems to be of good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Always love Aura Cacia essential oils, fine quality every time, recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  It&#x27;s a lot better than the brand &amp;#34;Now&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I found this under the listing for Organic Lavender Oil. There was 2.5 oz or 5 oz options I chose the 5 oz and apparently it was only the 2.5 oz that was organic. I wish there was just a separate listing for both. Other than that it is just as advertised and a good brand.</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia makes superior essential oils.  I love this brand.</li>
    <li> Met all of my essential oil expectations.</li>
    <li> i love lavender essential oil, it&#x27;s a staple oil for me. Aura cacia is one of my favorite brands. My first bottle leaked a bit in transit and when I contacted amazon they shipped me a replacement immediately.</li>
    <li> Love Lavender! We use it in a mist bottle for spritzing our pillows at bed time. So calming.</li>
    <li> This is the brand of Lavender oil I have been buying for years. Great value.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. This is pure lavender not a mixture. Don&#x27;t be fooled by others, with oils it really matters. This is a great product and I use it to relax, it really helps me. It puts me in a calming state.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful. added a few drops to my dogs shampoo because they STINK! :) plus lavender helps repel insects .</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! Amazing scent and great price!</li>
    <li> The product is fine, but when it arrived it had leaked in the box and it was missing approximately 1 mL (I compared it to other products of the same brand i recieved on the same day)</li>
