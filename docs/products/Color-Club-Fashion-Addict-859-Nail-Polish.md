      <li>but with two it was AMAZING!</li>
      <li>Good for winter and summer, all around a great polish.</li>
      <li>It holds better than the Layla Holographic polish and is thicker so you don&#x27;t have to use 4 coats to create the desired result, but it isn&#x27;t quite as shiny--still great polish!</li>
      <li>Beautiful color:)</li>
      <li>Price was nice and color was good.</li>

      <li>I love both the color of this polish and the gorgeous holographic that goes with it.</li>
      <li>It looks so good on your nails that you can&#x27;t stop staring at the cool effects</li>
      <li>This holo is not as strong a holo as the rest in the collection, but I am glad I ordered it and love wearing it!</li>
      <li>and I told my husband if he wanted to buy me any more I would not object...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Absolutely stunning to me.</li>
      <li>, i love the prism look.</li>
      <li>love this.</li>
      <li>I had a much better experience.  </li>
      <li>it looks like a gel polish, and I LOVE the color.  </li>
      <li>I want to get more colors now.</li>

      <li>but I will consider color club instead since the price is better as well.</li>
      <li>Love this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>I love color club polishes.</li>
      <li>I love this polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love it</li>
      <li>The holo is fabulous!</li>
      <li>With the addtion of the Seche Vite top coat this polish can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>The colors are amazing when the light hits it.  </li>
      <li>This is my first review on Amazon and it&#x27;s for good reason.</li>
      <li>They make really great nail polish in general, this was one of their earlier holographic colors,but now they make a way more awesome holo polish.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on easy, does not strick, dries well and looks</li>
      <li>The color, however, is a very pretty lilac shimmer, but I was expecting way more holographic effect.</li>
      <li>This shade varies from silver/gray to lightly iridescent hues.</li>
      <li>Mine went on so smoothly</li>
      <li>it dries pretty quickly, only needs two layers at the most and comes off very easily as well!</li>
      <li>It looks a little bit more purple than in the pics this site shows, but its gorgeous</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an obvious, striking holo, which I love.</li>
      <li>It does come off quickly though</li>
      <li>Very pretty and holographic, as described.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t even need to be out in the sun for the holo to be evident; works as well under fluorescent/incandescent/natural light.</li>
      <li>great over black.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m sure that could be fixed.</li>
      <li>To me it looks like a flash of rainbow right on your nail.</li>
      <li>Polish goes on smooth, no bubbles, streaking, lumps, and two coats is sufficient for complete opaque coverage.</li>
      <li>It looks exactly like it does in the picture.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>However I can add now that it did really well at not chipping !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently useing ( sally hansen No Chip Acrylic Top Coat)</li>
      <li>How pretty is this polish?</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really pretty to look at.</li>
      <li>I want Color Club to make more polish like this in different colors.</li>
      <li>I am definitely going to order more Color Club colors.</li>
      <li>I ordered this polish after seeing several pictures online showing the strong linear holographic effect of this color.</li>
      <li>The color is darker, more of a pink than what is shown in the picture, it does have some holo effect but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped for.  </li>
      <li>I really dig this polish and my lady friends have all begged for me to give them a mani using it.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a pearly-white with a hologram, but it is definitely light purple/Lilac in its overall color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice as a few coats by itself or as a top coat over a solid color for a different effect.  </li>
      <li>The polish did go on smoothly and dried quickly.</li>
      <li>an average polish when it comes to chipping but with a stronger top coat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pale lilac color, with a shimmer that gives off a nice rainbow of colors.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>However, the bottle I received only had a very light scattered holo effect only visible in direct sunlight.</li>
      <li>I Went like three days with only minimal chipping and that is RARE for me, most chip the same day.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a little more purple than i expected, but it&#x27;s still very pretty.</li>
      <li>Not wrong enough to return, but not what I hoped for either...</li>
      <li>This polish is a pretty pale lavender color and it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Not terribly long lasting on your nails, but so worth it for the brilliance</li>
      <li>I have been through OPI and China Glaze and other halographic polishes and this is the first in years that is truly halographic.</li>
      <li>Grainy, barely any prism.</li>
      <li>but indoors it looks pretty plain, like a gray/lavender glitter polish.</li>
      <li>The holograph effect is slighly less noticeable under &#x27;fake&#x27; lighting, but it really pops in natural light.  </li>

<li> This polish has a slight purple tint to it.</li>
<li> I take the precaution of using rubbing alcohol to clean the soaps and moistureizers off my nails before I put down a base coat</li>
<li> and I had seen a few girls on Instagram use it.  </li>
<li> The basic color is like a dusty, pinkish purple but the holo effect also gives off multi-color shimmer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this nail polish! An amazing quality! Beautiful color:)) shine like a rainbow! I want to buy more colors!</li>
    <li> This polish is a pretty pale lavender color and it dries quickly. It&#x27;s an obvious, striking holo, which I love.</li>
    <li> I thought I already reviewed this polish, but Amazon is reminding me, so I guess not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI this polish is Lavender or Lilac colored, not white with purplish highlights as the picture might indicate. I was hoping for a pearly-white with a hologram, but it is definitely light purple/Lilac in its overall color. The holo is fabulous! You don&#x27;t even need to be out in the sun for the holo to be evident; works as well under fluorescent/incandescent/natural light. Polish goes on smooth, no bubbles, streaking, lumps, and two coats is sufficient for complete opaque coverage. I really dig this polish and my lady friends have all begged for me to give them a mani using it. Good for winter and summer, all around a great polish. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> How pretty is this polish? Fashion Addict has holo glitter in it and it&#x27;s really pretty to look at. The basic color is like a dusty, pinkish purple but the holo effect also gives off multi-color shimmer. To me it looks like a flash of rainbow right on your nail. I want Color Club to make more polish like this in different colors. It&#x27;s Absolutely stunning to me.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a holo polish that wasn&#x27;t $15 a bottle and this was it! Price was nice and color was good. It does come off quickly though</li>
    <li> This polish is the most expensive in my nail polish collection and in my opinion it was NOT wort it. it looks really nice in the sun but indoors it looks pretty plain, like a gray/lavender glitter polish.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish.  The holographic effect is visible and the color is very trendy.  Highly recommend.  Had never tried color club before, usually use OPI but I will consider color club instead since the price is better as well.</li>
    <li> I love this polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easy, does not strick, dries well and looks amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is so deep and complex it is mesmerising!</li>
    <li> I ordered this polish after seeing several pictures online showing the strong linear holographic effect of this color. However, the bottle I received only had a very light scattered holo effect only visible in direct sunlight. Apparently, there have been issues with this and other Color Club holo polishes having inconsistencies with the amounts of holographic particles from bottle to bottle, resulting in several \\&quot;duds\\&quot;.  The color, however, is a very pretty lilac shimmer, but I was expecting way more holographic effect.</li>
    <li> This product shipped the day I purchased it.  The color is darker, more of a pink than what is shown in the picture, it does have some holo effect but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped for.  I also ordered Revvvolution but have not tried it yet.  The polish did go on smoothly and dried quickly.</li>
    <li> Pretty in the sun, but not much to look at if in artificial light.</li>
    <li> Very nice color. I love color club polishes. This holo is not as strong a holo as the rest in the collection, but I am glad I ordered it and love wearing it!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting one of these colors for soooooo long its crazy. They are just so expensive in the stores. The pigment with just one coat was pretty awesome but with two it was AMAZING! I want to get more colors now.</li>
    <li> They make really great nail polish in general, this was one of their earlier holographic colors,but now they make a way more awesome holo polish. Which I now also have, but I would still recommend because I like a variety</li>
    <li> Beautiful holographic lilac</li>
    <li> Never had a holographic nail polish and I had seen a few girls on Instagram use it.  I bought it and LOVE it!  It looks so good on your nails that you can&#x27;t stop staring at the cool effects lol</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to have holographic bits, but it&#x27;s 99% silver and pink shiny bits. Not wrong enough to return, but not what I hoped for either...</li>
    <li> Very pretty and holographic, as described.  It&#x27;s nice as a few coats by itself or as a top coat over a solid color for a different effect.  Seems to last for awhile.  Looks amazing in the sun.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little more purple than i expected, but it&#x27;s still very pretty. it dries pretty quickly, only needs two layers at the most and comes off very easily as well! i love it! an average polish when it comes to chipping but with a stronger top coat i&#x27;m sure that could be fixed.</li>
    <li> I have been through OPI and China Glaze and other halographic polishes and this is the first in years that is truly halographic.Looks fab in the sun and when in the house. I got it in several colors. Not terribly long lasting on your nails, but so worth it for the brilliance</li>
    <li> This is my first review on Amazon and it&#x27;s for good reason. This polish is amazing, so sparkly and shiny. As my first hollo polish purchase, and am so Impressed with the effect. With the addtion of the Seche Vite top coat this polish can&#x27;t be beat. I would say if you were looking for a good deal and love lilac then BUY THIS POLISH!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this instead of shelling out 15, It&#x27;s a purple holo .. I don&#x27;t love it but I don&#x27;t hate it either... However I can add now that it did really well at not chipping ! I Went like three days with only minimal chipping and that is RARE for me, most chip the same day.</li>
    <li> I love both the color of this polish and the gorgeous holographic that goes with it. Works well as a base or for stamping.</li>
    <li> product not what i thought it would be but shipping was on time</li>
    <li> This shade varies from silver/gray to lightly iridescent hues. great over black.  love this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It looks a little bit more purple than in the pics this site shows, but its gorgeous, i love the prism look.</li>
    <li> This polish has a slight purple tint to it. It holds better than the Layla Holographic polish and is thicker so you don&#x27;t have to use 4 coats to create the desired result, but it isn&#x27;t quite as shiny--still great polish! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this nail polish for it&#x27;s originality it is beautiful on and I told my husband if he wanted to buy me any more I would not object... the only issue I have with this nail polish is I&#x27;m having a hard time keepin it on my nails. I take the precaution of using rubbing alcohol to clean the soaps and moistureizers off my nails before I put down a base coat but I still have issues with the nail polish cracking and comming off the next day. But I&#x27;ve discovered that if you don&#x27;t put down a base coat it doesn&#x27;t chip and crack off... maybe it&#x27;s the base coat I&#x27;m currently useing ( sally hansen No Chip Acrylic Top Coat) but in any respects I absolutely love this polish and the halo effect it has. I would recomend this nail polish to anyone to buy.</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing when the light hits it.  I get compliments from everyone, including men.  I&#x27;ll be posting my nail designs</li>
    <li> Nice color I really like it.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  It looks exactly like it does in the picture.  The holograph effect is slighly less noticeable under &#x27;fake&#x27; lighting, but it really pops in natural light.  I saw a couple of remarks about inconsistency, and the color being pink.  I had a much better experience.  Mine went on so smoothly it looks like a gel polish, and I LOVE the color.  It&#x27;s a very pale lilac color, with a shimmer that gives off a nice rainbow of colors. I am definitely going to order more Color Club colors.</li>
    <li> Grainy, barely any prism.</li>
