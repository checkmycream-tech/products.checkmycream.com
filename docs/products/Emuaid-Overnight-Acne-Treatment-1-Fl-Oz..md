      <li>, hopefully they will fix that part as the product is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Always excellent service never any complaints</li>
      <li>Benzyl Peroxide seems to work best for me (Acne.org&#x27;s version), but it was ruining my clothes and sheets...</li>
      <li>Works the best out of all I&#x27;ve tried for post menopausal cystic skin issues.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Best applied overnight</li>
      <li>Dries up acne, very good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I did!&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so happy of the makers of this.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>This stuff works amazing on stubborn acne!</li>
      <li>The product is great and the color blends in like a good make-up.</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this product because of the good reviews it had.  </li>
      <li>I think that this treatment is probably good for spot treatment, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
      <li>Just buy the calamine lotion which by the way is cheaper and worked better!</li>
      <li>This seemed interesting and it works!  </li>
      <li>this a try, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
      <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t really follow the directions, as they are not the best to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I kind of recommend if you&#x27;ve tried everything out there.</li>
      <li>It kind of works, but it won&#x27;t make any acne disappear overnight.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m thrilled i took a chance on this product.</li>
      <li>If you do, it can be very drying and make your skin peel or crack which isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful to have complete relief so soon.  </li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t expect it to smell nice or be something you can wash off easily.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>If you have acne, this is the top of the tree.</li>
      <li>My teenagers love this product.  </li>
      <li>The Emuaid product, and most (if not all) of the sulfur smell should be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cystic acne may require more treatments but stick with it &amp; you&#x27;ll get results.</li>
      <li>He rinses it off in the morning and then uses a moistorizer without oil, a sunscreen and his face is so much better.</li>
      <li>my skin is looking so much better.  </li>
      <li>or just moisturize the area more often throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make sure to get most of it off.</li>
      <li>And make sure to have a really strong face wash too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>for putting on the product, it&#x27;s fairly easy.</li>
      <li>It has a really strong sulfur smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Either the product is so strong that it has gone underneath my skin, or it is not washing off my face.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t break me out or make any new acne pop up, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>Great for acne healing especially if it&#x27;s inflamed!</li>
      <li>Fantastic med, works overnight.</li>
      <li>But that is probably the normal time it takes for any kind of acne to go away too.</li>
      <li>I bought the original on a groupon.  </li>
      <li>For best result, dip a Q-tip into the pink sediment, draw it straight out, and apply.</li>
      <li>The dermatologist &#x27;s visits, acne cream, special cleansers and doxycicline costing over $200 and did nothing to improve the situation.</li>
      <li>Wow, this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>apple cider vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, coconut oil, mild face peels (Paula&#x27;s Choice), bacitracin ointment, Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid) and L-Carnitine (which does help over time), and changed my brand of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>He absolutely loves it!!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell if I was able to wash it off in the morning, but once morning comes and I try to wash it off my face (3 or 4 times w/ different face washes), I can still smell the strong sulfur scent on my face.</li>
      <li>a little dab before bed and when you wake in the morning the offending zit will be greatly reduced, if not gone.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing at reducing inflammation and will bring deep pimples up to the surface for faster healing.</li>
      <li>Only use this for spot treatment, and nothing more.</li>
      <li>This acne treatment is only okay.</li>
      <li>One bottle can last you many months if you do not use a swab and just use your finger to spread on your face.</li>
      <li>I bought this a 2nd time and really love it.</li>
      <li>Works fast too!</li>
      <li>FIRST PRODUCT THAT SEEMS TO HELP MY SON WITH HIS ACNE</li>
      <li>I am elated that I can finally stop reading and looking for more products.</li>
      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s gonna last more than a year</li>
      <li>Wow, I am in shock!!!!</li>
      <li>Only thing is the mixture dries up easily even if there&#x27;s more liquid than the pink part of it.</li>
      <li>Please know whoever came up with this formula is a straight up genius.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;reducing pore size&amp;#34; but nothing does that really.  </li>
      <li>I applied Emuaid Overnight Acne to a very inflamed face with infected pustules.  </li>
      <li>i still don&#x27;t know why i decided to try it, since i really couldn&#x27;t find a lot of reviews.</li>
      <li>it really helps a lot</li>
      <li>He started using this at night after gently washing his face with an acne bar soap from GNC.</li>
      <li>this stuff really works but the shipping was a problem for me</li>
      <li>However, one thing that I really don&#x27;t like is the smell.</li>
      <li>Dip your cotton swab into the sediment &amp; pull straight out &amp; apply.</li>
      <li>You kind of have to shake it because the product separates in the bottle with the pink powder stuff and the clear liquid.</li>
      <li>But I definitely recommend you only use this product if you live alone or have your own room.</li>
      <li>It does get a bit messy, but once you put it on your face, it dries pretty well and will stay on your face for most of the night.</li>
      <li>sure you let it settle so that the clear liquid sits atop the pink sediment.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; claim is suspect as it has taken 4 weeks to make even modest progress on certain areas of my face.  </li>
      <li>Then, just go wash your face like normal.</li>
      <li>The smell is super bad and affects my breathing lol.</li>
      <li>The first night I used it, I ended up putting a lot of it on my entire face.</li>
      <li>this REALLY works instantly!</li>
      <li>So I began experimenting with natural remedies......</li>
      <li>At 65 years of age, I&#x27;m experiencing perioral dermatitis ~ adult acne on and around the chin area.</li>
      <li>Works overnight; my 13 yr old son loves it-</li>
      <li>If you experience dryness in the area of application, rub any natural oil (vitamin e, castor oil, argan oil, etc.)</li>
      <li>The instructions say to use a ear swab to put it on your face, but what happens is that the product will be absorbed by the swab itself, while there won&#x27;t be much left to actually put on your face.</li>
      <li>It will significantly reduce the size of a pimple overnight and clear it within a few days.</li>
      <li>I always only wash my face once in the morning, but this product required that I wash my face at least 4 or 5 times to get most of the smell</li>
      <li>so hes not home every night, but we have finally found the light at the end of this long dark tunnel we have been in.</li>
      <li>Nothing has ever worked, most treatments have made the condition worse.  </li>
      <li>We tried other things like proactive and different acne creams nothing really worked.  </li>
      <li>Could it be a little less pink though and more human skin color?  </li>
      <li>The clear acne-fighting medicine sits atop a pink sediment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the BEST overnight pimple remover I have ever used.  I bought the original on a groupon.  Amazing stuff.  Virtually disappears overnight.  No kidding.</li>
    <li> Wow, this product is amazing. I&#x27;ve always been a Proactiv customer but only because of the repairing cream, it&#x27;s what actually gets rid of the acne. I&#x27;ve never experienced acne problems &amp; only suffer from the occasional premenstrual pimples, which is why I finally decided to dump Proactiv &amp; gave this a chance....I&#x27;m so happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emuaid got rid of my pimple overnight &amp; I couldn&#x27;t believe it was gone! Even Proactiv doesn&#x27;t do it in one day. I&#x27;m so happy I found this. It&#x27;s only $20 &amp; it&#x27;s gonna last more than a year, I KNOW it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you let it settle so that the clear liquid sits atop the pink sediment. Dip your cotton swab into the sediment &amp; pull straight out &amp; apply. Best applied overnight so it works with your body&#x27;s regenerative state during your sleep cycle. Besides, the stuff is pink &amp; you&#x27;re probably not going to want to walk around with pink crust on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cystic acne may require more treatments but stick with it &amp; you&#x27;ll get results. If you experience dryness in the area of application, rub any natural oil (vitamin e, castor oil, argan oil, etc.) or just moisturize the area more often throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try, you&#x27;ll be glad you did! 😃</li>
    <li> My teenagers love this product.  It works.</li>
    <li> Always excellent service never any complaints</li>
    <li> I followed the direction but it did not work on me at all. The smell is super bad and affects my breathing lol.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Put on the infected area within 3 days it&#x27;s gone. Such a miracle. Even its 1 pimple or painful pimple it really helps a lot</li>
    <li> Helped to make my breakouts smaller and lighter in color. I would definitely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> Works overnight; my 13 yr old son loves it-so rapid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great-authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again-Thank You.</li>
    <li> Amazing! At 65 years of age, I&#x27;m experiencing perioral dermatitis ~ adult acne on and around the chin area. The dermatologist &#x27;s visits, acne cream, special cleansers and doxycicline costing over $200 and did nothing to improve the situation. The prescription actually aggravated the eruptions  So I began experimenting with natural remedies......apple cider vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, coconut oil, mild face peels (Paula&#x27;s Choice), bacitracin ointment, Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid) and L-Carnitine (which does help over time), and changed my brand of toothpaste. Then I saw an review for Emuaid as I was perusing the web for other avenues. What the heck, I&#x27;ve tried everything else. ONE application and a saw a vast improvement. I noticed a new blemish forming ~ a deep, blind pimple. A dab of Emuaid and hours later it was gone....GONE! Just don&#x27;t go overboard using this (once a day is enough). I also suggest doing a gut cleanse (check with a homeopath or naturopath).</li>
    <li> Terrific even for teenage sport sweat related acne!  Could it be a little less pink though and more human skin color?  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my daughter&#x27;s acne! Overpriced calamine lotion knockoff,  Just buy the calamine lotion which by the way is cheaper and worked better! jmo</li>
    <li> I have suffered with severe acne and rosacea all my life.  I have used everything the Dermatologist prescribed for 40 years.  Nothing has ever worked, most treatments have made the condition worse.  I applied Emuaid Overnight Acne to a very inflamed face with infected pustules.  The oil that my nose and face excretes literally burns my skin.  All other products just seem to make the burning worse.  This product calms, clears, and stops that excess oil, heals the wounds and pustules.  It is wonderful to have complete relief so soon.  It is really sad that this product is not on the shelf at Walmart for a more affordable price.  I am re-ordering because the small bottle is half gone after just two days.&lt;br /&gt;  I was wrong about the bottle being half empty after two days.  These bottles last me almost a month and I apply liberally every day.  The product is great and the color blends in like a good make-up. I have much less acne now than when I started using this product about 3 months ago.</li>
    <li> Fantastic med, works overnight.</li>
    <li> I have spent over 1,000 on products for my 15 year old son. Hes been to 2 dermatologist, I&#x27;ve bought everthing I could find at the drug stores. I ran up on this and of course I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order. Wow, I am in shock!!!! This stuff is amazing!!!! My sons acne is really bad with big red blotches and puss. He started using this at night after gently washing his face with an acne bar soap from GNC. He rinses it off in the morning and then uses a moistorizer without oil, a sunscreen and his face is so much better. Hes 15 so hes not home every night, but we have finally found the light at the end of this long dark tunnel we have been in. If you have acne, this is the top of the tree. Pro active is a joke as is agne.org. I am elated that I can finally stop reading and looking for more products. This is his best friend and a life savor for embarrassment. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. We are customers forever!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i bought this treatment through a livingsocial deal -or was it groupon? i don&#x27;t remember. anyway, it was two bottles for under $20 so i figured i&#x27;d give it a shot. i still don&#x27;t know why i decided to try it, since i really couldn&#x27;t find a lot of reviews. but out of the handful of written reviews i could find, they were all positive.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried countless products, both over the counter as well as prescription and this stuff beats all of them. a little dab before bed and when you wake in the morning the offending zit will be greatly reduced, if not gone. it&#x27;s amazing at reducing inflammation and will bring deep pimples up to the surface for faster healing. i&#x27;m thrilled i took a chance on this product. i will be reordering once i&#x27;ve used up my current stash.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son cause he has had a bad acne problem! This is part of his daily facial cleansing routine!! He absolutely loves it!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son..... We tried other things like proactive and different acne creams nothing really worked.  He tried emuaid and it works!  In a couple of days I noticed it was working and still is.  The one thing he doesn&#x27;t like it leaves his skin dry but he puts moisturizer on in the morning and it&#x27;s fine.  I would recommend buying emuaid.</li>
    <li> This acne treatment is only okay. It kind of works, but it won&#x27;t make any acne disappear overnight. Maybe if you use it 2 or 3 nights, then the acne you are targeting will go away. But that is probably the normal time it takes for any kind of acne to go away too. However, one thing that I really don&#x27;t like is the smell. It has a really strong sulfur smell. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell if I was able to wash it off in the morning, but once morning comes and I try to wash it off my face (3 or 4 times w/ different face washes), I can still smell the strong sulfur scent on my face. I always only wash my face once in the morning, but this product required that I wash my face at least 4 or 5 times to get most of the smell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the product is so strong that it has gone underneath my skin, or it is not washing off my face. The first night I used it, I ended up putting a lot of it on my entire face. The next morning, I realized that I couldn&#x27;t fully wash it off. I went to work, hoping that other people wouldn&#x27;t smell the sulfur on my face. I&#x27;m not really sure if they did or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean I wouldn&#x27;t care of the smell if the product worked wonders on my face, but for actual efficacy, it&#x27;s probably not worth the smell. I think that this treatment is probably good for spot treatment, but that&#x27;s it. It didn&#x27;t break me out or make any new acne pop up, so that&#x27;s good. But I definitely recommend you only use this product if you live alone or have your own room. The smell will definitely bother other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for putting on the product, it&#x27;s fairly easy. It does get a bit messy, but once you put it on your face, it dries pretty well and will stay on your face for most of the night. The instructions say to use a ear swab to put it on your face, but what happens is that the product will be absorbed by the swab itself, while there won&#x27;t be much left to actually put on your face. This will waste the product. I usually just shake it a little and then put it on my finger and then my finger spreads it on. Also, the instructions say to not shake it. You kind of have to shake it because the product separates in the bottle with the pink powder stuff and the clear liquid. So don&#x27;t really follow the directions, as they are not the best to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I kind of recommend if you&#x27;ve tried everything out there. This product uses both salicylic acid and sulfur in one product, plus calamine lotion type stuff to soothe your skin, that this is probably the reason why this product may work for you. But don&#x27;t expect it to smell nice or be something you can wash off easily. Only use this for spot treatment, and nothing more. And make sure to have a really strong face wash too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/14/2014&lt;br /&gt;So I am still using this product after 4 months from my initial review. One bottle can last you many months if you do not use a swab and just use your finger to spread on your face. I&#x27;ve also discovered a way to get rid of the product and its smell in the morning. Before you wash your face, get a wet towelette and wipe off the Emu Aid product from your face. Make sure to get most of it off. Then, just go wash your face like normal. The Emuaid product, and most (if not all) of the sulfur smell should be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this for spot treatment now. I do not put it all over the face. If you do, it can be very drying and make your skin peel or crack which isn&#x27;t very good. For me, this  is still 3 stars.</li>
    <li> awesome product. it started drying up my pimples. i do recommend it.  i love it</li>
    <li> I have tried almost everything and I am 39 years old and hated seeing that my face still looked as if I was a teenager.  Hands down this has beat everything I used.  I no longer hide my face. It does work so well that it dries you up but with shea butter and vitamin e my skin is looking so much better.  I swear by this stuff I dunt care what anyone says this is a miracle bcz I usually have the worse case of acne known to man don&#x27;t care about writing reviews but I&#x27;m so happy of the makers of this. That i had to write.  Please know whoever came up with this formula is a straight up genius.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works but the shipping was a problem for me, hopefully they will fix that part as the product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product because of the good reviews it had.  My daughter and I tried this for several days and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Not even a little bit.  Maybe this was old/expired.</li>
    <li> I bought this a 2nd time and really love it. If you have a breakout and need it gone the next day- this REALLY works instantly!</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazing on stubborn acne! Works fast too!</li>
    <li> FIRST PRODUCT THAT SEEMS TO HELP MY SON WITH HIS ACNE</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well</li>
    <li> Works the best out of all I&#x27;ve tried for post menopausal cystic skin issues.  The &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; claim is suspect as it has taken 4 weeks to make even modest progress on certain areas of my face.  It is terribly drying but for those of us suffering from oily, bumpy skin, that isn&#x27;t such a bad thing.  I will buy again and hopefully it will continue to help.</li>
    <li> Great for acne healing especially if it&#x27;s inflamed! Only thing is the mixture dries up easily even if there&#x27;s more liquid than the pink part of it. It&#x27;s just a waste of money if you can&#x27;t use all the product. But aside from that i believe this helped heal my acne.</li>
    <li> Smells a bit bad, but works.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a miracle cure for me.  I&#x27;ve had cystic acne since my mid 20s (mid 40s now) and hormonal acne since my mid 30s...so I&#x27;m always fighting something.  I&#x27;ve tried all prescription things topically and orally (except Accutane).  Benzyl Peroxide seems to work best for me (Acne.org&#x27;s version), but it was ruining my clothes and sheets...but I put it up with it for decades.  I decided again to try SA.  This seemed interesting and it works!  I wake up every morning with some skin sloughed off and softness!  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;reducing pore size&amp;#34; but nothing does that really.  My skin IS dry, but no more or less so than with other products.  I only use this once a day (at night as it leaves a chalky pink face) and OIay Nighttime Elixir DURING THE DAY under sunscreen.  I have used the Olay for a few months and had results as far as skin softness and resurfacing, but between those two I am on the way to CLEARER, softer, and less scarred looking skin.</li>
    <li> Dries up acne, very good</li>
    <li> The Emuaid is supposed to look like it&#x27;s separated. The clear acne-fighting medicine sits atop a pink sediment. For best result, dip a Q-tip into the pink sediment, draw it straight out, and apply. Allow the Emuaid to dry over the pimple, and the pink sediment will create a &amp;#34;shield&amp;#34; over the blemish (this way it won&#x27;t rub off while you sleep).  Emuaid is supposed to be used as a spot treatment, not as a treatment for severe (all-over) acne. For the occasional pimple or blemish, it works! It will significantly reduce the size of a pimple overnight and clear it within a few days. (If the bottle arrives with the contents mixed, allow it to sit undisturbed for awhile and the pink will settle to the bottom.)</li>
