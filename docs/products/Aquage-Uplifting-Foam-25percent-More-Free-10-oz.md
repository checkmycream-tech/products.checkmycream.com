      <li>I received it very quickly and will reorder.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Light weight and easy to massage through the scalp.</li>
      <li>and I was in search of a good product that would help bring back some volume I had when my hair was shorter.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find the product to perform any more effectively than other mousse products and had no uplifting properties.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite hair product</li>
      <li>and it really helps!!</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and straight.  </li>

      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>my only issue is that I&#x27;ve developed a lot of static since I started using this.</li>
      <li>In your best interest you should only buy from a local salon, about 98% of the professional products for sale on here are diverted and usually very old living out their shelf life long before you buy them,</li>
      <li>Finally I found something to give me lift for my hair without making it feel super sticky.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recomend this product.</li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t notice that big of difference and the price is pretty high.  </li>

      <li>It is a very light foam and gives lift without being heavy and weighing down fine or thin hair.</li>
      <li>I have super thick hair and after following a blog from a hair stylest</li>

<li> This product did the trick hands down.</li>
<li> It is weightless and lifts my limp hair from the roots.</li>
<li> So I bought it in hopes to give my heavy hair some volume.  </li>
<li> I have heavy hair</li>
<li> I learned about this product from the small things blog.  </li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> /&gt;a bit expensive though</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This really helps if you have problems with humidity and your hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter had heard about the product from a friend and wanted to try it..we ordered a can and then she loved it so much that all her friends wanted it so I ordered 5 cans...quick service and lower price than the first place we purchased from, will definitely be using this seller again..</li>
    <li> wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a bit expensive though</li>
    <li> I watched an online tutorial on how to apply this to your roots. Talk about great volume and hold! I had movie star hair until I was through!</li>
    <li> Love this product, great lift and texture. I have thin hair and it really helps!! I use on bangs too for extra texture and hold.</li>
    <li> I loved it the first time I used it. Now, I think it&#x27;s overpriced for what it does.  It has a small nozzle to get under layers of hair, but the same affect can be achieved with a mousse that you first dispense into hands before applying and doesn&#x27;t have as high a price point as this product. Just my thoughts. Hope it helps!  Cheers ~</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly and have found the best price on Amazon.com. I would recommend this product to anyone. I have heavy hair but this product still gives me the lift I desire.</li>
    <li> It was not as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> I read about this product on a blog and it was highly recommended for volume and lift for fine hair. I didn&#x27;t find the product to perform any more effectively than other mousse products and had no uplifting properties.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and I&#x27;m so glad I found this!!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all or make it greasy at the roots.  It gives me volume so my hair doesn&#x27;t hang so flat and holds the style.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this!!</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair and after following a blog from a hair stylest she said that she wouldn&#x27;t go a day without using it.  So I bought it in hopes to give my heavy hair some volume.  It was just OK, I have not used it for about a month now.  I just didn&#x27;t notice that big of difference and the price is pretty high.  I will stick with the Kendra Volume spray she recommened though.  It is great!</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does! Adds texture to hair as well, which makes styling easier.</li>
    <li> Cap was broken -- but I was able to use cap  from old bottle so no problem</li>
    <li> Amazing product-love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!!!  It&#x27;s THE BEST.  My hair is fine and straight.  This gives me just the right about of lift if I want it.  I can finally have body.</li>
    <li> Light weight and easy to massage through the scalp. Gives hair a lift with out making your scalp feel like it has a lot of product. I would highly recomend this product. Its one of the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  It gives your hair so so so much lift!  I can style my hair and wear the style 2-3 days without shampooing it!  I highly recommend it!  &#x3D;)  I will never go without this stuff again!</li>
    <li> In your best interest you should only buy from a local salon, about 98% of the professional products for sale on here are diverted and usually very old living out their shelf life long before you buy them, even worse, half the time they put a different product in the actual bottle you are buying and that&#x27;s SCARY. Not to mention, what happened to supporting a small business by buying that product there and helping the economy? Just sayin.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I have very flat, straight hair and have tried all kinds of things.  This really gives the volume it promises and has a nice, soft hold that lasts all day.  I received it very quickly and will reorder.  This is my new favorite hair product</li>
    <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or crunchy at all!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  Finally I found something to give me lift for my hair without making it feel super sticky.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Aquage Uplifting Foam is THE BEST product I have come across for adding volume and lift to my thinning, fine hair. I learned about this product through thesmallthings.com blog and have been using it continuously since January of this year. It will always have a place in my morning routine!</li>
    <li> I use it on my bangs, it makes it easier to keep my curly bangs in place after drying my hair.</li>
    <li> Love many things about this product--the smell, the way it builds texture in my hair...my only issue is that I&#x27;ve developed a lot of static since I started using this. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Aquage helps me style my thick, fine blond hair.  It is weightless and lifts my limp hair from the roots.</li>
