      <li>Great blades.</li>
      <li>Great Value I paid under $13.00 for 100.</li>
      <li>Love these blades best</li>
      <li>These are a good blade.</li>
      <li>Almost as good as the feather blades and at a lot lower price.</li>
      <li>I tried these blades out in a sampler and loved them immediately.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As Good as my favorites, Kai and feather.</li>
      <li>it is every bit as good as any blade I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 5 months shaving with just them, and I can say they are giving me the most consistently great shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>But over-all they do the job nicely.</li>
      <li>recommendation to anyone new to DE razors is to order a sample pack to figure out what blades work best for your face.</li>
      <li>Very good blades and they shave real close.</li>
      <li>Work the best so far in my Merkur 39c.</li>
      <li>the test I thought I liked Big Ben and Mercur best.</li>
      <li>In fact if the manufacturer were to ask for my advise on how to make the product better</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve tried many blades Feather,Vincent,Dorco</li>
      <li>Better and sharper than derbys dorcos and personas.</li>
      <li>To date my favorite and go to blade has always been a Merkur.</li>
      <li>you can just breeze through,but to me what makes these blades outstanding is when you shave bald clients.</li>
      <li>I could only say &amp;#34;throw in a happy ending or leave it the hell alone&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>My favorite razors.  </li>
      <li>i love them.</li>
      <li>My husband likes them better than all the others he tried.</li>
      <li>They may not be the greatest for someone with a coarse beard, or for someone who doesn&#x27;t shave every day.</li>
      <li>They seem pretty mild to me, but the shave is good.</li>
      <li>Smooth cut everytime.</li>
      <li>I would pay double great blades.</li>
      <li>Recommend you pick up a sample pack first, then choose the blade that gives you the most comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>At the end the three top blades were Gillette Nacet Stainless @ .22 cents per blade, Feather @ .29 cents per blade, and Treet Platinum @ .13 cents per blade.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, great clean shave</li>
      <li>Better than any DE blade I am aware of consistent quality.</li>
      <li>The great thing is that they are half the price.</li>
      <li>Assuming the quality is consistent these things are a steal!</li>
      <li>Wilkinson and Persona also make some very good blades and if any of the aforementioned blades were the only blade on the market I&#x27;d never complain.</li>
      <li>,they are very durable ,and smooth.</li>
      <li>Using less product and getting a better shave and better looking skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>During the 5 month trial I used the same razor (a Ebo Jager), soap (from a local artisan soapmaker) and badger brush to minimize variables as best I could, and followed the same routine faithfully.</li>
      <li>first time trying and didnt really like them.</li>
      <li>Fyi, the two shave thus far have been in a Merkur 34c and a 1952 Gillette Super Speed.</li>
      <li>But this one rates very high.</li>
      <li>I am a barber and use these for straight razor shaves and line-ups.</li>
      <li>is that they are very forgiving</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used straight (cut throat), safety, injector, cartridge, and electric shavers.</li>
      <li>This blade works very well for me.</li>
      <li>Shave is much smoother.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The other 99 blades may suck and this one may only be good for two but at the price, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
      <li>To this point (normally limit blades to 4 shaves)</li>
      <li>Im a professional barber</li>
      <li>I was delightfully surprised by Treet.</li>
      <li>the face is almost like a racetrack.lol you don&#x27;t have to press hard and with the right shaving cream and the right amount of pressure and angles</li>
      <li>Dont dry shave with these, u must use a shave cream or shave gel first to moisturize the skin so the razor can glide.</li>
      <li>Smooth andclose - even on neck and under chin, usual problem</li>
      <li>Tried it as well as a new soap at the same time.</li>
      <li>Currently shaving with Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Shave Soap and some homemade Bay Rum aftershave and a rosemary-lavender lotion with shea butter to moisturize.  </li>
      <li>Face turned bright red and burned like hell after a cold water rinse and alum block.</li>
      <li>Next day, I used my regular soap (Proraso - Sensitive).</li>
      <li>Using it on sensitive skin that leans towards dry with no problems.  </li>

<li> With these I&#x27;ve shaved 12 bald heads a week without nicking anyone and these are  the same clients i&#x27;ve used with  the other razors</li>
<li> I&#x27;m upgrading from Feather razors that only stay sharp for 1 or 2 shaves.</li>

<li> Also these are packaged inside two seperate layers of wrapping paper which make it hard to snap in half, so I treasure one of the wrappers off first then split in half.</li>

<li> I recommend that anyone starting with a safety razor follow the method I used as the results will vary according to your skin type, but for me Treet were the winner - hands down!</li>
<li> They stay sharp for 5+ shaves on a Feather AS-D2.  </li>
<li> other razors seem to be inconsistent with their sharpness and edge quality.</li>
<li> These razor blades are an extreme value.  </li>
<li> With the other razors some were too sharp and would nick no matter</li>
<li> This one seemed to be a little less &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; than some of the others in the sample pack and ended up being repurchased.  </li>
<li> Feather, 7 O&#x27;Clock (yellow and black) and Astra all ran closely behind.</li>
<li> So as usual your mileage may vary.</li>
<li> Never use a dull blade.  </li>
<li> Very thin sharp razor.  </li>
<li> Sampling and testing was blind: I rated the blades without knowing which blade was loaded in my razor by removing the blades from their wrapping, so I couldn&#x27;t tell by the wrapping which I was choosing, then putting all the blades in a box, and randomly selecting and loading one on my razor in the dark (not one cut finger!).</li>
<li> I selected these after a blind trial that lasted over 5 months.</li>
<li> MY BAD!!  </li>

    <li> These blades are the best out . Im a professional barber so I&#x27;ve tried many blades Feather,Vincent,Dorco,Murker yet these are are better.what makes these blades great is that they are very forgiving ,they are very durable ,and smooth. Shaving  the face is almost like a racetrack.lol you don&#x27;t have to press hard and with the right shaving cream and the right amount of pressure and angles you can just breeze through,but to me what makes these blades outstanding is when you shave bald clients. With the other razors some were too sharp and would nick no matter how well you shave. With these I&#x27;ve shaved 12 bald heads a week without nicking anyone and these are  the same clients i&#x27;ve used with  the other razors</li>
    <li> Safety razors are much better (and less expensive) than newfangled razors.  Never use a dull blade.  Recommend you pick up a sample pack first, then choose the blade that gives you the most comfortable shave.  This one seemed to be a little less &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; than some of the others in the sample pack and ended up being repurchased.  Using it on sensitive skin that leans towards dry with no problems.  Currently shaving with Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Shave Soap and some homemade Bay Rum aftershave and a rosemary-lavender lotion with shea butter to moisturize.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a long time. To date my favorite and go to blade has always been a Merkur. Feather, 7 O&#x27;Clock (yellow and black) and Astra all ran closely behind. Wilkinson and Persona also make some very good blades and if any of the aforementioned blades were the only blade on the market I&#x27;d never complain. All that being out of the way, let me just simply say this, I&#x27;ve shaved but twice with the Treet Platinum. To this point (normally limit blades to 4 shaves) it is every bit as good as any blade I&#x27;ve ever used. In fact if the manufacturer were to ask for my advise on how to make the product better I could only say &amp;#34;throw in a happy ending or leave it the hell alone&amp;#34;! Fyi, the two shave thus far have been in a Merkur 34c and a 1952 Gillette Super Speed. WTG, AcTG and AgTG, with a 4th pass diagonally on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other 99 blades may suck and this one may only be good for two but at the price, I don&#x27;t care. Assuming the quality is consistent these things are a steal!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a quality product</li>
    <li> My husband likes them better than all the others he tried.</li>
    <li> I selected these after a blind trial that lasted over 5 months. During that time I had many brands of blades that I randomly selected to test and rate  in several categories that I made up: pull, burn, closeness, nicks &amp; cuts, and number of shaves. Each category was rated on a scale of 1 to 5. Each brand of blade had 5 samples, so I could try each of them multiple times. Sampling and testing was blind: I rated the blades without knowing which blade was loaded in my razor by removing the blades from their wrapping, so I couldn&#x27;t tell by the wrapping which I was choosing, then putting all the blades in a box, and randomly selecting and loading one on my razor in the dark (not one cut finger!). I only looked at the brand after I was finished with that blade trial. During the 5 month trial I used the same razor (a Ebo Jager), soap (from a local artisan soapmaker) and badger brush to minimize variables as best I could, and followed the same routine faithfully. Brands tested included Treet, Shark, Wilkinson, Derby Extra, Asco, Big Ben, Dorco, and Mercur, .Before the test I thought I liked Big Ben and Mercur best. But the highest scores went to the Treet Platinum., again and again.I couldn&#x27;t argue with the results. It&#x27;s been 5 months shaving with just them, and I can say they are giving me the most consistently great shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I am 53 and have been shaving since I was about 13, so that&#x27;s about 40 years. I&#x27;ve used straight (cut throat), safety, injector, cartridge, and electric shavers. And Treet is the best yet. Of course every razor and person is different, but for me, these rock. If you&#x27;re on the fence, give them a try!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your service.  The razors work great.</li>
    <li> My favorite razors.  They stay sharp for 5+ shaves on a Feather AS-D2.  I&#x27;m upgrading from Feather razors that only stay sharp for 1 or 2 shaves.</li>
    <li> first time trying and didnt really like them. MrOfficial on instagram recommended these so i thought id have a try. I only used them for a little bit ,the rest I threwed them away.</li>
    <li> As Good as my favorites, Kai and feather. The great thing is that they are half the price. I was delightfully surprised by Treet.</li>
    <li> Great value, great shave, great durability. I tried these blades out in a sampler and loved them immediately.&lt;br /&gt;A recommendation to anyone new to DE razors is to order a sample pack to figure out what blades work best for your face.</li>
    <li> Great blades. After shaving with these, I bought a pack of feathers because of their popularity. Went back to my Treets to shaves later. Shave is much smoother. I found feathers to be inconsistent</li>
    <li> These are a good blade. They seem pretty mild to me, but the shave is good. They may not be the greatest for someone with a coarse beard, or for someone who doesn&#x27;t shave every day. But over-all they do the job nicely.</li>
    <li> Great shave!! Great price!!</li>
    <li> Best blades iv ever used. Better and sharper than derbys dorcos and personas. Smooth cut everytime. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> these razors are the best safety razors i have tried. i love them. no irritation or pulling. other razors seem to be inconsistent with their sharpness and edge quality.</li>
    <li> Better than any DE blade I am aware of consistent quality. Great Value I paid under $13.00 for 100. I would pay double great blades.</li>
    <li> One of these came in a sampler from Amazon. Tried it as well as a new soap at the same time. MY BAD!!  Face turned bright red and burned like hell after a cold water rinse and alum block. Next day, I used my regular soap (Proraso - Sensitive). Very brave of me but I wanted to see if the blade was at fault (razor and 3 pass technique remained the same).What a difference a soap makes! No redness or sting with alum block. Smooth andclose - even on neck and under chin, usual problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying the rest of the blades in the sampler. But this one rates very high.</li>
    <li> Love these blades best I&#x27;ve used...mo complaints</li>
    <li> Very good blades and they shave real close. Almost as good as the feather blades and at a lot lower price. Thank You</li>
    <li> Work the best so far in my Merkur 39c. Blades are a highly personal selection. So as usual your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> These are the best Razors I&#x27;ve ever worked with.</li>
    <li> Very thin sharp razor.  I am a barber and use these for straight razor shaves and line-ups. Dont dry shave with these, u must use a shave cream or shave gel first to moisturize the skin so the razor can glide. Any friction and this blade WILL cut your client. Also these are packaged inside two seperate layers of wrapping paper which make it hard to snap in half, so I treasure one of the wrappers off first then split in half. Other than that, great clean shave I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This blade works very well for me. Very happy !</li>
    <li> These razor blades are an extreme value.  I purchased a multi-pack of razor blades a couple of months ago and began rating (1-10) the different brands of razor blades as I used them.  I rated by comfort, length of use, and cost of the blade.  I have been having problems with a rash on the side of my face and also noted whether the blades increased the problem.  At the end the three top blades were Gillette Nacet Stainless @ .22 cents per blade, Feather @ .29 cents per blade, and Treet Platinum @ .13 cents per blade.  The cost was through Amazon.  For comfort at a cost of about half the cost the Treet Platinum were the clear winner.  I recommend that anyone starting with a safety razor follow the method I used as the results will vary according to your skin type, but for me Treet were the winner - hands down!</li>
