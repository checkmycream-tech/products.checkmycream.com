      <li>The quality is still excellent.</li>
      <li>Perfect service.</li>
      <li>Great for travel.    </li>
      <li>but they are a good product and have 4 rows of brush compared to the 2 the airline gave out.</li>
      <li>Cheap price, and they&#x27;re great for what they are.</li>
      <li>Nice to have one for backpack and one for the office.</li>
      <li>Nice travel set.</li>
      <li>They work great, are not flimsy and, most important, do not create static in my hair.</li>
      <li>Plastic is cheap but product works good</li>
      <li>but it gets the job done in pretty happy with it</li>
      <li>It is very cheaply made and can easly break if you have think hair like mine</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>cuz I just didn&#x27;t need so many.</li>
      <li>I love these compact brush/comb.  </li>
      <li>The brushes are comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>Because they were so cheap</li>
      <li>The teeth on the comb and the brush are finished so they are smooth at the tips.</li>
      <li>Also, it folds conveniently to fit into your pocket.</li>
      <li>These fit the bill.</li>
      <li>portable, light.  </li>
      <li>The teeth on the brush actually have rounded ends - nice touch.</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>: I ordered a second set of the brushes because my traveling and sailing friends wanted more.</li>
      <li>As others have said, the brush teeth are not beaded on the end, but instead are just straight prongs.</li>
      <li>Given the price, about a buck apiece, I was not expecting much.</li>
      <li>Fold into a slim shape to fit easily into a pocket or small purse.</li>
      <li>I had a similar comb and wanted more of the same.  </li>
      <li>Love these little foldable brush combs</li>
      <li>This product is great value for money, can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
      <li>I am a male with thinning scalp and as such, the sparse brushes are fine.</li>
      <li>However, I have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>Although the tips of the brush bristles do not have plastic balls, the tips are not sharp.</li>
      <li>These look the same, but the plastic is not quite as hard as my original.  </li>
      <li>To my surprise, they are pretty sturdy and did not stink like a petrochemical waste product.</li>

    <li> They get the job done. They are not super high quality but like I said it gets the job done</li>
    <li> I love these compact brush/comb.  I put one in my backpack, one in travel bag, one to my daughter, etc.  The price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; is somewhat pliable with just enough give that brush and comb don&#x27;t hurt the scalp. The teeth on the comb and the brush are finished so they are smooth at the tips. The brush bristles and comb teeth are long enough to style medium length hair. Fold into a slim shape to fit easily into a pocket or small purse. Great for travel.    I was dubious as the seller is located in Hong Kong and shipping was estimated to be several weeks-- arriving Oct. 7. In fact, they arrived on Sept. 3, sent via air mail. Perfect service.    Update in 2014: I ordered a second set of the brushes because my traveling and sailing friends wanted more. The quality is still excellent. Although the tips of the brush bristles do not have plastic balls, the tips are not sharp. The brushes are comfortable to use. As in 2013, the shipping was faster than advertised. Perfect service.</li>
    <li> The comb brushes that came were spiked and not with the little balls on the end as the picture shows. Because they were so cheap I gave them out as xmas stuffers instead of returning them. Still looking for this combination brush comb with balls :(</li>
    <li> The airlines used to give out something like this when flying overseas. But over the years I lost a few and ordered these to place them everywhere, car, backpack, office etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a long time for shipping but they are a good product and have 4 rows of brush compared to the 2 the airline gave out.</li>
    <li> This product is great value for money, can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Also, it folds conveniently to fit into your pocket.</li>
    <li> portable, light.  would recommend</li>
    <li> Okay. Given the price, about a buck apiece, I was not expecting much. To my surprise, they are pretty sturdy and did not stink like a petrochemical waste product. The teeth on the brush actually have rounded ends - nice touch. I have multiple uni-purpose bags (gym, travel, toiletry, etc) and put one of these combs in each of them. I am a male with thinning scalp and as such, the sparse brushes are fine. Not sure if a female would find these brushes acceptable.</li>
    <li> Compact and just the thing if you occasionally need a brush or a comb. Buy the five pack so you can have one for car, work, dresser, travel bag &amp; gym bag.</li>
    <li> Plastic is cheap but product works good</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve read the reviews. Product delivered is not what is pictured - with the thinner comb bristles and protection knob on the end. I&#x27;ll see what my wife says, but I doubt they&#x27;ll work the same.</li>
    <li> Cheap price, and they&#x27;re great for what they are. Nice to have one for backpack and one for the office. Gave away the others cuz I just didn&#x27;t need so many.</li>
    <li> product as described and expected. arrived on time. great seller!</li>
    <li> Got what I expected to, and while they&#x27;re soft plastic, they work. I dont expect this item to last me 3-5 years, and thats why I have 5.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the brush teeth are not beaded on the end, but instead are just straight prongs.</li>
    <li> Nice travel set. Thank you</li>
