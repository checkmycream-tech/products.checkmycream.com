      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>However, ItCosmetics has a much better moisturizing stain with the \\&quot;Je</li>
      <li>The color is great alone or over your favorite neutral shade and it is really moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Always love their products.</li>
      <li>so I was glad about that.</li>

      <li>Love the texture and the color.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve had this Anti-Aging Lipstick before and love the feel and results.  </li>
      <li>You will LOVE this and all It Cosmetics products.</li>
      <li>Moisturizing, conditioning, beautiful, and soft.</li>
      <li>Quoi is the lightest shade and gives a beautiful baby pink shade to lips, also nice and glossy.  </li>
      <li>I am a fan, and I am so impressed that I plan to try other products from this line.</li>
      <li>The little bit of color it puts on your lips is perfect!!  </li>
      <li>It is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun to see the color change also!  </li>
      <li>The product feels great on the lips and gives your lips a bunch of hydration with just a hint of pink.</li>
      <li>In fact, I love it so much I&#x27;ve given it as a gift.</li>
      <li>I admit I am tickled by this charming French phrase used to indicate a quality that, I don&#x27;t know what.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I wish the stain would last longer and the they weren&#x27;t so soft they do break easily but feel great on.</li>
      <li>So moisturizing, evens out to the best natural pink lip, so worth the money</li>
      <li>GOES ON CLEAR AND TURNS INTO A BEAUTIFUL LIGHT PINK SHADE.</li>
      <li>I prefer to look more natural and this lipstick does that for me.</li>
      <li>My wife says that this product is well worth it</li>
      <li>&quot; shade simply turns to a very bright pink.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I really like this lipstick!</li>
      <li>The first time I put it on my lips the product fell apart and landed on the ground :</li>
      <li>I love it, it moisturizes and protects my lips, it lasts a long time and it still is in one piece and never moved around in the tube.</li>
      <li>I have never used a lip stick, lip balm, or lip gloss as much as this one.</li>
      <li>This product is very moisturizing on the lips.  </li>
      <li>IT IS VERY CONDITIONING ALSO.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this product after seeing it numerous times on QVC.  </li>
      <li>Ready to try new color.</li>
      <li>If you decide to try these I recommend starting with this light pink shade first.  </li>
      <li>Just a suttle difference from my natural color</li>
      <li>I have medium skin with a yellow undertone, and this color is very flattering.  </li>
      <li>( I tried to put it back, but it didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
      <li>Even the very dark \\&quot;Pretty</li>

<li> : when I received it it had apparently come out of it&#x27;s box and was loose in the envelope.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a person who really wears a lot of lipstick because usually it ends up looking like I&#x27;m too made up.</li>
<li> long lasting</li>
<li> I have tried almost all the shades and they all turn to various degrees of pink.  </li>
<li> If you ever used the lip stains from years ago by Alexis Vogel, those all did the same thing, turning pink.  </li>
<li> The first reaction is a subtle blush of color, but a tinge remains after the gloss wears down a bit.  </li>
<li> and I only got half of what I paid for.</li>
<li> I wear this alone or under other lipsticks.</li>
<li> I was mad because it&#x27;s pretty expensive</li>
<li> One negative though</li>
<li> The color it gives is not nice.</li>
<li> It came to me on time and packaged well, not sure what happened to the product after that!  </li>
<li> When I opened the tube about 1/2 of it had broken off and was destroyed.</li>

    <li> Bought for my daughter, she loves it.  Delivered promptly, on time.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product after seeing it numerous times on QVC.  It came to me on time and packaged well, not sure what happened to the product after that!  The first time I put it on my lips the product fell apart and landed on the ground : ( I tried to put it back, but it didn&#x27;t really help. The product feels great on the lips and gives your lips a bunch of hydration with just a hint of pink. Might need to just buy this from QVC next time though!</li>
    <li> My wife says that this product is well worth it</li>
    <li> This product is very moisturizing on the lips.  It gives a hint of color and glow, without having a bright color shade on.  I like to wear it at work where I don&#x27;t like having on bright lip color.</li>
    <li> I love it, it moisturizes and protects my lips, it lasts a long time and it still is in one piece and never moved around in the tube. The tip is a bit pointy but that is just from the way I apply it!  I love It Cosmetics!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. Only lipstick I use now. Love the texture and the color. Ready to try new color. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lip flush in Je Ne Sais Quoi.  I admit I am tickled by this charming French phrase used to indicate a quality that, I don&#x27;t know what.&amp;#34;  I have to say the lip flush lives up to its name.  It has an elusive quality .  The first reaction is a subtle blush of color, but a tinge remains after the gloss wears down a bit.  In addition, my lips were left feeling supple and hydrated, even after a meal. I have medium skin with a yellow undertone, and this color is very flattering.  I am a fan, and I am so impressed that I plan to try other products from this line.</li>
    <li> I CAN NOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS LIPSTICK. GOES ON CLEAR AND TURNS INTO A BEAUTIFUL LIGHT PINK SHADE. IT IS VERY CONDITIONING ALSO. WILL BE ORDERING MORE.</li>
    <li> Saw this on QVC and had to have it!!! Just wasn&#x27;t buying through them. The little bit of color it puts on your lips is perfect!!  You will LOVE this and all It Cosmetics products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE It Cosmetics and I heard this was their best selling color. Well, now I understand why. It is fantastic. The color is great alone or over your favorite neutral shade and it is really moisturizing. Can&#x27;t get any better than that. I would never be without it. Love it!</li>
    <li> very nice gloss.  not greasy or drying and the light color just enhances your own lip color</li>
    <li> I really like this lipstick! I&#x27;m not a person who really wears a lot of lipstick because usually it ends up looking like I&#x27;m too made up. I prefer to look more natural and this lipstick does that for me. Just a suttle difference from my natural color so I was glad about that. One negative though: when I received it it had apparently come out of it&#x27;s box and was loose in the envelope. When I opened the tube about 1/2 of it had broken off and was destroyed. I was mad because it&#x27;s pretty expensive and I only got half of what I paid for. I probably will not order again because of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Anti-Aging Lipstick before and love the feel and results.  It&#x27;s fun to see the color change also!  In fact, I love it so much I&#x27;ve given it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I keep several a tubes of this around because I never want to run out!  Perfect texture, perfect tint and great moisturization.  I wear this alone or under other lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick! So moisturizing, evens out to the best natural pink lip, so worth the money and I&#x27;d recommend it for any skin tone.</li>
    <li> This is my go to. I have never used a lip stick, lip balm, or lip gloss as much as this one. Moisturizing, conditioning, beautiful, and soft. Brightens up my face even on no makeup days. Had to get more!</li>
    <li> The Je Ne Sais Quoi is the lightest shade and gives a beautiful baby pink shade to lips, also nice and glossy.  Non- drying,  long lasting but I do re-apply to keep the glossy moist look.  I have tried almost all the shades and they all turn to various degrees of pink.  Even the very dark \\&quot;Pretty Woman\\&quot; shade simply turns to a very bright pink.  If you ever used the lip stains from years ago by Alexis Vogel, those all did the same thing, turning pink.  However, ItCosmetics has a much better moisturizing stain with the \\&quot;Je Ne Sais Quoi.\\&quot;  If you decide to try these I recommend starting with this light pink shade first.  Its truly my favorite!</li>
    <li> This a great feeling lipsticks. I wish the stain would last longer and the they weren&#x27;t so soft they do break easily but feel great on.</li>
    <li> Always love their products. They definitely have staying power through the day.</li>
    <li> Did no like it al al!!! The color it gives is not nice. Gave it away...</li>
