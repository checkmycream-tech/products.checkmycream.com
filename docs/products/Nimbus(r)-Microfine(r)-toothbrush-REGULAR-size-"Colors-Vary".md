      <li>and I really liked it.  </li>
      <li>but it feels so effective.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this brush (switched from an electric that I liked and had been using for years)</li>

      <li>but this one has worked the best so far!</li>
      <li>they are very comfortable and effective when brushing gums and teeth.</li>
      <li>It is the best toothebrush to use whether or not you have sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>This is a perfect toothbrush if you have sensitive teeth or receding gums.</li>
      <li>I will stick with the nimbus as I really liked it even better than Oral-B.</li>
      <li>the longer bristles really help, feeeeels good!</li>
      <li>Healthy for you teeth.</li>
      <li>I have come to Amazon through a google search looking for where I can purchase more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m convinced this is better than the electric.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order more at some point.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more of these.  </li>
      <li>While the $200 brush polishes better, it doesn&#x27;t get at the gums and between my teeth as well as</li>
      <li>People with healthy gums that are up on and between the tooth like they should be are going to feel the bristles of this toothbrush poke them.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering this again!! :)</li>
      <li>I truly love this brush.  </li>
      <li>My hygenist has healthy gums and complains this toothbrush hurts her gums.  </li>
      <li>I knew that it would be better for my gums and teeth in the long-run.</li>
      <li>Better check-ups, too.</li>
      <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I think this toothbrush cleans between your teeth better than others but</li>
      <li>SO much better than the supposedly &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I immediately ordered 5 more, and plan to tell my dentist about them.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The bristle get my teeth nice and clean without having to push or be forceful.  </li>
      <li>This makes them more durable and makes the brush more precise to control.    </li>
      <li>very soft and very effective</li>
      <li>If you have periodonitis, cleaning between your teeth is the most important because floss does not do the job.  </li>
      <li>The toothbrush is very soft and the longer fine bristles do a great job of cleaning between your teeth.  </li>
      <li>If only I had discovered this brush right after I had gum grafts, it would have been perfect.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is not only kind on your teeth, it is more effective.</li>
      <li>The product is fine.</li>
      <li>From the moment I put it in my mouth, however, I felt a HUGE difference.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny and more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;BTW, it *is* still available in a multi-pack.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable grip.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ergonometric and comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>Nimbus could definitely help educate people about why this feeling occurs and why it is good for you, otherwise many will reject the brush for reasons stated.</li>
      <li>After the first use, I immediately ordered more.</li>
      <li>This is by far and away the best hand-held toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>well while the longer bristles get along the gum line for an unsurpassed feeling of clean.</li>
      <li>FEEL so clean afterward.  </li>
      <li>; they never seemed to get my teeth as clean as I wanted.  </li>
      <li>it had been like brushing with a steel wire brush that you use to clean spark plugs</li>
      <li>My teeth did not feel clean using this toothbruch</li>
      <li>I needed a softer brush that still got my chompers clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sort of signal that your teeth are clean.</li>
      <li>my teeth do thank Nimbus for keeping them clean...</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are great and worth the extra cost.</li>
      <li>Yes, good for any age, especially for supporting healthy gums.  </li>
      <li>Also, the bristles of variable length are good at getting between teeth and into crevices much better than other toothbrushes</li>
      <li>It is amazing how far under your gums it gets.</li>
      <li>I use Lush toothy tabs as toothpaste and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with my smile these days.</li>
      <li>I just got it today, seems to do the job, soft like I wanted, the longer bristles may have to go, They poke into my gums and kind of hurt, I&#x27;ll wait and see, if they continue to poke at me</li>
      <li>After I&#x27;d used this brush for a year, I bought one for my son and I&#x27;m getting more for the whole family.</li>
      <li>Nimbus is super soft and yet amazingly effective at getting your teeth clean.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the nimbus toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Yep, it&#x27;s a nice toothbrush with super soft bristles...</li>
      <li>This was the toothbrush my periodontist gave me as a sample to use,  I loved it, it is soft and gentle to the gums and the bristles can get through between teeth.</li>
      <li>Super-soft, different length strands for good periodontal stimulation, perfect for my sensitive gums, beautifully constructed (they last twice as long as my previous favorite Gum brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have to order another one, maybe two. The best toothbrush I have ever found, and I&#x27;ve been trying em all out there. This one is truly the best for oral health. No more irritated gums. Better check-ups, too.</li>
    <li> I was using Medium and sometimes very stiff brushes before, thinking these would get my teeth cleaner, and that these wouldn&#x27;t work very well, but paradoxically, these allow you to be a lot more aggressive without damaging your gums or without you feeling uncomfortable, so I think that my teeth are much cleaner when using this very comfortable toothbrush. Also, the bristles of variable length are good at getting between teeth and into crevices much better than other toothbrushes have done fore me, something else I was worried it would not be good at. I&#x27;ve also had for a few months and it is holding up very well. I will definitely buy this one again.</li>
    <li> My hygienist introduced me to these toothbrushes. This is the softest toothbrush I have found, even compared with other brands \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot;. I have porcelain veneers that require a light, gentle touch (especially around the gumline). These toothbrushes can be purchased cheaper at the Nimbus website ($9.99 for 5 + $2.99 shipping).</li>
    <li> After just one brushing with the extra soft regular size Nimbus, I threw my Colgate brush in the garbage can- it had been like brushing with a steel wire brush that you use to clean spark plugs with!The Nimbus is super soft and yet amazingly effective at getting your teeth clean. If only I had discovered this brush right after I had gum grafts, it would have been perfect.I have sensitive receding gums, and this brush is the exact cure for them.</li>
    <li> Got one of these from my dentist and when it wore out I tried to go back to my regular \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot; toothbrush. It doesn&#x27;t even compare. My teeth feel so much cleaner with the nimbus and the other brush feels like it is tearing up my gums. Really so much better than any other toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; toothbrushes and brushed carefully since I was 15 years old and my mother had a periodontal scare that taught me the value of good brushing, focusing on the gums. For thirty years I used many brands, but liked Gum best because of their construction, shape, and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother introduced me to this toothbrush three years ago, and I&#x27;m hooked (line and sinker!). These toothbrushes are fantastic! Super-soft, different length strands for good periodontal stimulation, perfect for my sensitive gums, beautifully constructed (they last twice as long as my previous favorite Gum brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about these. If my family, friends and I are any example, once you try these you&#x27;ll never go back to any regular soft toothbrush. I gave one to my dentist and now she&#x27;s hooked, so her whole office uses them!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is not only kind on your teeth, it is more effective. After using this brush, given to me by my former dentist, I can&#x27;t stand the stiff hard things they sell as \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes at the grocery store.    The bristles on this brush are perhaps not as soft as most soft toothbrushes. This makes them more durable and makes the brush more precise to control.    But the all-important ends of the bristles are tapered and very kind to the gums. Despite the softness the pointy ends of the bristles get into small crevices and do a better cleaning job.    I&#x27;m here ordering a few more for myself right now.</li>
    <li> I bought 10 and have given them to friends and family as well as used them myself.  They are especially helpful if you have or want to prevent gum recession.  The bristles feel great - even though they are delicate, they last for a good long while yet help you do a thorough job cleaning your teeth and gums.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order more at some point.</li>
    <li> I alternate using this tooth brush and an electric OralB that cost me $200.  While the $200 brush polishes better, it doesn&#x27;t get at the gums and between my teeth as well as this Nimbus does.  It makes me feel much less for skipping daily flossing.</li>
    <li> After I&#x27;d used this brush for a year, I bought one for my son and I&#x27;m getting more for the whole family. Yes, good for any age, especially for supporting healthy gums.  [[ASIN:B001B6ECGU Nimbus® microfine toothbrush REGULAR size \\&quot;Colors Vary\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> I used to use the Sonicare electric toothbrush religiously.  I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find a traditional toothbrush that would give me the same clean feeling after brushing.  The Nimubs microfine toothbrush does just that!</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehesive about purchasing this brush when I first heard about it from my dentist.  I mean, how could a manual toothbrush be better than an electric one?! From the moment I put it in my mouth, however, I felt a HUGE difference.  It has these longer brittles that get to the hard to reach areas better than the ones that claim the same.  I used it for a week and then tried my old toothbrush to compare the two.  I have to admit that it makes \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes feel like you&#x27;re brushing with a brillo pad!!  I will never go back to anything else, including my expensive electric brush!  Even my usually indifferent boyfriend only uses the one I snuck in to his toothbrush holder.  I plan on buying some for the whole family as stocking stuffers.  I&#x27;m hooked and a life-long customer now.</li>
    <li> I am a fanatic about my teeth.  Consequently I tend to brush for a long time.  I was therefore making my gums recede.  The nimbus is the answer.  I can brush for a very long time and it&#x27;s so soft that it doesn&#x27;t bother my gums.  My teeth feel great!!!!  My dentist is very happy, he&#x27;s the one who gave me one.</li>
    <li> Healthy for you teeth. Its like a massage for your teeth</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this brush (switched from an electric that I liked and had been using for years) I&#x27;m convinced this is better than the electric.  The surface of my teeth feels cleaner, and the first few times I used it I got blood, even though I hadn&#x27;t been getting any with the electric.  Comfortable grip.  I really like it and am ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it *is* still available in a multi-pack.  [[ASIN:B005LB75NI Pack of 5 Nimbus microfine toothbrush REGULAR size \\&quot;Colors Vary\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> these brushes were recommended by my endodontist for gum disease. they are very comfortable and effective when brushing gums and teeth. i&#x27;ve been using them for 2 years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush from my dentist in my \\&quot;goodie bag\\&quot; and was skeptical (I usually prefer a stiffer brush). But WOW.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a brush and my mouth/teeth FEEL so clean afterward.  I have wisdom teeth still - and it can be difficult to get back there, but this brush, due to the softness, can get back there.  I truly love this brush.  I never thought I&#x27;d write a review for a toothbrush, but well, here it is.  I noticed some gum soreness initially, but it got much better with use.  Favorite brush by far.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this after I heard a friend recommenced it.  I like it as much as you can like such a practical item.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush makes my old name brand extra soft,compact,sensitive toothbrush feel like a brushing with a rock. After the first use, I immediately ordered more. It really does feel like brushing with a cloud. It cleans very well too and my teeth look like they were polished. I use Lush toothy tabs as toothpaste and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with my smile these days.</li>
    <li> I suspect that people will either love or hate this toothbrush. I was very surprised at how soft the brush was, yet left my gums pulsing/throbbing after brushing. Turns out that the tapered bristles are so effective at getting deep under the gum line and cleaning that it leaves your gums throbbing afterwards. No other brush I know does this. The feeling is similar to when you leave the dentist office after a cleaning and your gums feel a bit sore. So the Nimbus brush is very effective. I figured that after a few days that my gums might become even healthier and get more used to this brush, but it still throbs after I brush. I&#x27;m ok with this obviously because it is doing it&#x27;s job (unlike other brushes) and also because the throbbing goes away after 5-10 minutes. It&#x27;s a sort of signal that your teeth are clean. But I think that some people will absolutely hate/reject this brush because of the throbbing feeling. Nimbus could definitely help educate people about why this feeling occurs and why it is good for you, otherwise many will reject the brush for reasons stated.</li>
    <li> This was the toothbrush my periodontist gave me as a sample to use,  I loved it, it is soft and gentle to the gums and the bristles can get through between teeth. Im glad it is sold at Amazon from this seller.  Great experience from this seller, will buy again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Yep, it&#x27;s a nice toothbrush with super soft bristles...it&#x27;s ergonometric and comfortable to use.  While it just may change your life, I wish I could choose my color...a yellow toothbrush just isn&#x27;t my style...but that&#x27;s not the end of the world, is it...my teeth do thank Nimbus for keeping them clean...now if brushing would floss with ease and comfort...someday...someday...</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush after reading the reviews (all 5 stars). I have a problem with brushing too hard, which is making my gums receed, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.     My gums were sore for literally hours after using it, each time, and that is after letting hot water run over it for 10 seconds and brushing really lightly. The bristles feel really soft, but it has a bunch of single bristles shooting out from the head, so I think they might have been the problem.    Even with \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; toothbrushes, my gums have never felt like that, so yeah, I feel like I wasted $7.    I&#x27;m switching back to an Oral B Extra Soft.</li>
    <li> This is by far and away the best hand-held toothbrush I have ever used.  My dental hygienist recommended that I purchase the Nimbus (which, I&#x27;d never even heard of, and was unable to find in a store).  When I searched for it online I was pleased to have found it on Amazon.  What an awesome find. I have already stocked up on this product.  Hat&#x27;s off to my dentist office -- and hygienist!</li>
    <li> Very soft brush. The bristle get my teeth nice and clean without having to push or be forceful.  I bought one of these after a word of mouth recommendation and am now back to order more as the wife wants one. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My dentist started giving this toothbrush to all her patients and I must say I was a little disappointed as I have never been a fan of soft-bristled brushes; they never seemed to get my teeth as clean as I wanted.  After using this brush for the first time, I knew I would never use another toothbrush again! It&#x27;s soft, okay - that&#x27;s obvious, so I knew that it would be better for my gums and teeth in the long-run. What surprised me was how clean my teeth felt and how stimulated my gums felt. It was a whole new brushing experience. I&#x27;m sold and now I&#x27;m in the process of selling all my family and friends on it. You can oder a pack of 5 from the Nimbus website for $10 ($2/brush) and they come individually wrapped - great stocking stuffers or just a nice little - \\&quot;hey try this\\&quot; gift.  Bottom line is . . . this is the best brush you will ever use, guaranteed.</li>
    <li> I received one of these brushes from my new hygienist the other day and I really liked it.  I have come to Amazon through a google search looking for where I can purchase more.  I do not have periodontal disease.  When you feel the brush with your fingers, the bristles are quite soft.  When I brushed my teeth with the brush, I had no trouble and my gums did not hurt afterward.  I have receding gums due to long-time use of hard bristled brushes, and will never go back to the hard bristle again.  Previous to this nimbus I used Oral-B sensitive.  I will stick with the nimbus as I really liked it even better than Oral-B.</li>
    <li> I like the long bristles- I think this toothbrush cleans between your teeth better than others but the other bristles are so soft I have to brush a really long time to get the gum line clean.</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product. This toothbrush was given to me at first by my dentist, and now I can&#x27;t use any other.</li>
    <li> bought previously, great product (I use for guests</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive or receding gums, best toothbrush out there and for a great price. I definitely recommend.. . .</li>
    <li> I have some gum recession and my periodontist gave me one of these to try.  He highly recommends them.  It is amazing how far under your gums it gets.</li>
    <li> Received one of these brushes from my periodontist, and when it came time to replace it I scoured the planet looking for one for a year and finally was able to buy them through Amazon! An extra soft brush is so essential to people like me with gingival recession.</li>
    <li> The product is fine. They led me to believe I was getting several toothbrushes for $2.50 however I only got one!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a toothbrush like this for years!  It is very gentle yet it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My gums bleed easily with a soft toothbrush.  This is the softest brush I have ever used.  However, I can see that it does not remove the plaque around the teeth, so it may not be effective.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect toothbrush if you have sensitive teeth or receding gums. I was buying the regular over the counter extra soft toothbrush and this one puts them to shame. I tried one but will be definitely be buying the 5 pack next time. Worth every penny and more. Nimbus is perfectly named, it feels like a cloud!</li>
    <li> My teeth did not feel clean using this toothbruch</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was recommended to me by my dentist. It&#x27;s the softest toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever used.  While soft, it still feels like it&#x27;s doing a good clean without pressing hard.  Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Nimbus toothebrush is an excellant toothebrush that has super soft bristles that really clean your teeth and massage your gums. It is the best toothebrush to use whether or not you have sensitive teeth. My boss recommended the brush to me, and I now buy it on Amazon by the dozens and give them to my whole family. I started using the Nimbus because I have sensitive teeth, and I noticed my gums were receding. This brush will prevent that. I wish I had started using this brush when I was younger, I probably would have healthier gums today. All the so called \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothebruses are not soft enough. Perfect for children too.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth, so when i eat chocolate, my teeth will start aching like crazy. And i always thought that was the problem, eating sweets (which i never really do anyway), and then getting a shocking aching feeling instantly. But then i read somewhere that if you use hard bristled, or normal toothbrushes, that it can cause irritation on the gums, from brushing with that type of toothbrush. Its not necessarily the amount of pressure you put on the toothbrush, but its the toothbrush itself. So i bought this toothbrush and it is amazing. When it arrived, the bristles felt a little harder then i expected, but when i actually brushed with them, they were very soft, and if i ate something, or drank hot or cold water, that instant pain would show up and it made me very happy! Keep in mind that if the bristles look like they are frayed or all over the place, then its time to replace it, but thats the same for every toothbrush. I will be ordering this again!! :)</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush invented by a periodontic doctor.  Bristles are very soft but if you use the standard 2 minutes for brushing they clean your teeth just as well without tearing your gums off and saving your enamel</li>
    <li> I just got it today, seems to do the job, soft like I wanted, the longer bristles may have to go, They poke into my gums and kind of hurt, I&#x27;ll wait and see, if they continue to poke at me I&#x27;ll just cut em off. But like I said soft..I changed my mind..the longer bristles really help, feeeeels good!</li>
    <li> As the title reads, it&#x27;s the best brush I have ever used. It&#x27;s soft enough so it feels real nice when brushing but still firm enough to do it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s actually the softest brush I&#x27;ve ever used but it feels so effective. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have gotten these at the dentist before and found them to be superior to any other manual and with my electric down for a battery change I needed a manual and bought these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are great and worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering these from now on, so soft that it doesn&#x27;t cause gum irritation. My gums are sensitive so this works so well! SO much better than the supposedly &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes you get at the store, they are much more harsh on the gums.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. Only review I ever wrote about a simple toothbrush. It is very soft but the bristles get teeth clean. I use it with Sensodyn (sp?) toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush seems to have helped my three teeth with exposed gums. They are less sensitive using this brush.</li>
    <li> 12/25/10 Merry Christmas! I just found out you can buy this toothbrush cheaper at Nimbus.com.      I feel like I need to edit this review so some are not misled.  I think this toothbrush is really for people who have early stage to moderate periodonitis (perio).  It has short stiff bristles that clean the surface of your teeth and fine longer bristles that clean between your teeth.  The toothbrush is very soft and the longer fine bristles do a great job of cleaning between your teeth.  If you have periodonitis, cleaning between your teeth is the most important because floss does not do the job.  I have heard some complain that this toothbrush hurts their gums.  My hygenist has healthy gums and complains this toothbrush hurts her gums.  If you have perio, I don&#x27;t think this brush will make your gums sore.  People with healthy gums that are up on and between the tooth like they should be are going to feel the bristles of this toothbrush poke them.  It is the bristles that are trying to work between your teeth, but if you do not have perio, you may not need it, but you may really like it.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well this toothbrush works for me.  I have been using it for almost two (Now probably 4 years) years now and I have early stage perio.  I had a deep cleaning done two years ago and have been able to maintain the positive results of that work with the help of this toothbrush.  I also have recession, I found this brush, for this perio patient, to be gentle.  You do not need to apply much pressure at all with this brush.  So with this clarification, this is an excellent manual toothbrush.  I highly reccomend anyone try it if you have periodontitis.  The next best would be an electric toothbrush, you know the ones in your dentist office that cost a small fortune?  I don&#x27;t have the money for that so for now I will stick with the Nimbus.</li>
    <li> I first was introduced to this toothbrush when it came in my goodie bag from my dentist office.  I came home and ordered 3 more right away its like brushing your teeth and flossing at the same time.....its a little on the soft side so if your used to a harder bristle then its probably not for you.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush feels better than any I&#x27;ve ever had, even the Sonicare I have been using until recently. The short, stiff bristles clean tooth surfaces well while the longer bristles get along the gum line for an unsurpassed feeling of clean. I have fairly sensitive gums and I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with this toothbrush. Plus, a variety of spiffy colors!</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, but otherwise, nothing to like here.</li>
    <li> This is the type of toothbrush I&#x27;ve been looking for for a long time. Can&#x27;t understand why I don&#x27;t see this type anywhere in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;A well designed brush for sure.</li>
    <li> very soft and very effective</li>
    <li> Great product! Soft yet manages to clean teeth very well, easy on gums too. Well worth the higher cost! This is my new favorite toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I&#x27;m going to order a box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a quite a few toothbrushes that claim they&#x27;re sensitive enough for sensitive teeth but this one has worked the best so far!</li>
    <li> BEST toothbrush ever!!! I use it ever day and it does not hurt my gums! I love it ! !</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this toothbrush YEARS ago. I just tried for the first time and immediately went and ordered a quantity pack of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with sensitive teeth and gums, and thinning tooth enamel, and was diagnosed with the beginning stages of periodontal disease. Every toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried has been too firm, even the ones labeled &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;. This is the only one I&#x27;ve used that does not hurt my gums at all, it is super comfortable. This encourages me to brush longer (2 minutes is the recommended duration) and to use it on my gums to stimulate circulation, also as recommended by dentists. It does not seem at all abrasive on my tooth enamel. I absolutely love it, and look forward to seeing what my next dental checkup reveals after using this for awhile.</li>
    <li> Not what I was wanting, wanted a fuller head...too small.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a very soft toothbrush for my very sensitive gums for a few years now.  My former favorite brand of soft toothbrushes had been discontinued, so I have been suffering each time I brushed my teeth.  I took a gamble on the Nimbus based on the reviews, and I am very happy with it.  I immediately ordered 5 more, and plan to tell my dentist about them.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was given this toothbrush after I had a deep cleaning with the dental hygenist.  I took it home and put it away.  A few week later I took my new nimbus toothbrush with me when I went for a weekend getaway.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and gentle the bristles were on my teeth. This toothbrush is amazing. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the nimbus toothbrush. When I got home I ordered 15 Nimbus toothbrushes to give to my family and friends. I also threw out my old soft bristle toothbrush. FYI: Order from Nimbusdental.com as it is cheaper than other sites like Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a super soft brush.  Just what I was looking for.  I will be ordering more of these.  Has a sure grip handle and the bristles are super soft on my sensitive gums.  Can&#x27;t find this level of brush at the stores.  Happy I found Nimbus.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite toothbrush and the only one I will use for as long as possible. It is incredibly soft and does exactly what you&#x27;d expect a toothbrush to do. Superb for anybody with sensitive teeth/gums or with sensory trouble.</li>
    <li> I got a NIMBUS toothbrush from my dentist a few years ago and after trying it I could never use another brand. I have sensitive teeth and I like a soft brush but with most brands soft doesn&#x27;t really mean soft.. NIMBUS toothbrush is super soft and gentle, doesn&#x27;t hurt/irritate the gum at all. It also has some thinned out longer bristles (if that makes sense.. ) that reach under the gum around the teeth and between teeth. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t found it in stores yet so I always have to order it online.</li>
    <li> My dental assistant girlfriend was right, you don&#x27;t need a stiff toothbrush to knock that nasty plaque off.  These super soft toothbrushes do the job extremely well.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I needed a softer brush that still got my chompers clean.  This is perfect.  Yes, your gums are slightly sore the first couple of times you use it.  This stops after several brushes.  Its worth it.  It gets close to the gum line and slightly under and it won&#x27;t wear down your enamel as fast especially if youre a somewhat vigorous brusher such as myself.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!  Who know one could love a toothbrush??!  It has long and short bristles and IS like flossing while you brush your teeth.  I needed to use an extra soft brush due to being a &amp;#34;rough brusher&amp;#34; and was wearing away my gums....per my DDS. I still floss every day, but my teeth really feel clean.  I am going to stock up on these!</li>
