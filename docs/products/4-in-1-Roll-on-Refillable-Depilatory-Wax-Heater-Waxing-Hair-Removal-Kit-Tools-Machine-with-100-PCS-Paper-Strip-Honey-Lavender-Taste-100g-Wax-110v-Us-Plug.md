      <li>But this one was great!</li>
      <li>Everything was perfect.</li>
      <li>But that was a great decision.</li>
      <li>This product is very nice and the service too.</li>
      <li>It is amazing!</li>
      <li>You have to warm the wax for 30 to 40 minutes in the wax warmer</li>
      <li>In the beginning I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy this product or not.</li>
      <li>Its easy to use</li>
      <li>It might pinch a little but at the end it is perfect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, exactly to the picture</li>
      <li>The machine itself is good but the wax is quite low quality.</li>
      <li>I purchased the wax heater, because I didn&#x27;t want anything that would make a mess in my house, but I wanted to have my own kit and so far so good.  </li>
      <li>Seller was considerate but the product was not as good as expected.</li>
      <li>Arrived before than expected, good quality and saved a lot of money with this purchase.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t heat up right</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like this product will last more than a year.</li>
      <li>but you have to wait some minutes for it gets hot.</li>
      <li>The wax was great, I usually have very very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Wax removed hair quite well and really fast.</li>
      <li>My daughter used it and it gives pure clear skin.</li>
      <li>I liked the product and will be using it for legs and arms but not sure about facial use.</li>
      <li>and theres absolutely no mess.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t heat up right and broken on first use.</li>
      <li>Does not get hot enough to roll on without extreme pain.</li>
      <li>(heat up the wax) and no disgusting mess and the wax is not open for dust or little bugs to fall on it.</li>

<li> (heat up the wax) and no disgusting mess and the wax is not open for dust or little bugs to fall on it.</li>
<li> The wax is extremely sticky to work with and really hard to clean.</li>
<li> Use only the strips that come with the kit or recommended ones as other types will not take the wax off and it will stick to the skin.</li>
<li> It does take off the hair after dealing with the extreme pain.</li>
<li> so every time I get a wax I usually get red bumps, usually because  the wax is too harsh.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product,  it doesn&#x27;t work or heat up.  </li>
<li> You have to press on your skin really hard for anything to come out, tearing your skin.</li>
<li> wax is too hard to get heated.</li>
<li> I spent hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong</li>
<li> , the was is too thick</li>
<li> It is too bad.</li>
<li> Worst product</li>
<li> that comes with the roll on wax especially in cold weather so that the wax is liquid.</li>

    <li> It is too bad. It doesn&#x27;t work. Connected for 2 hours and it didn&#x27;t heat up right and broken on first use.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, exactly to the picture but you have to wait some minutes for it gets hot.</li>
    <li> I like the paper, I like the wax. Even the heater works, I think... But the wax does not come out! The roller doesn&#x27;t roll the wax onto your skin. You have to press on your skin really hard for anything to come out, tearing your skin. I&#x27;ve tried. I didn&#x27;t give up. I spent hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong why it wasn&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waaaaah.... Why can&#x27;t anyone make a wax heater that works!?</li>
    <li> Arrived before than expected, good quality and saved a lot of money with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough to roll on without extreme pain. It does take off the hair after dealing with the extreme pain.</li>
    <li> It is amazing! My daughter used it and it gives pure clear skin. It might pinch a little but at the end it is perfect. But it takes aling time to get the sticky stuff off but thats what every wax does. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Seller was considerate but the product was not as good as expected. The wax is extremely sticky to work with and really hard to clean. But i will try to work with it.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice and the service too.</li>
    <li> The machine itself is good but the wax is quite low quality.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but for this one I felt like I had to. In the beginning I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy this product or not. But that was a great decision. Its easy to use and theres absolutely no mess. The wax was great, I usually have very very sensitive skin so every time I get a wax I usually get red bumps, usually because  the wax is too harsh. But this one was great!</li>
    <li> I purchased the wax heater, because I didn&#x27;t want anything that would make a mess in my house, but I wanted to have my own kit and so far so good.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and it did it&#x27;s job (heat up the wax) and no disgusting mess and the wax is not open for dust or little bugs to fall on it.</li>
    <li> Wax removed hair quite well and really fast. You have to warm the wax for 30 to 40 minutes in the wax warmer that comes with the roll on wax especially in cold weather so that the wax is liquid. Use only the strips that come with the kit or recommended ones as other types will not take the wax off and it will stick to the skin. I used Neutrogena oil after the waxing but you can use baby oil too to soothe the skin. I liked the product and will be using it for legs and arms but not sure about facial use.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever!&lt;br /&gt;The wax is too hard to get heated. The heat provided by the unit is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the was is too thick so you would end up peeling your skin along with your hair!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product,  it doesn&#x27;t work or heat up.  I had mine connected for 2 hours and it didn&#x27;t heat up right</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like this product will last more than a year.</li>
