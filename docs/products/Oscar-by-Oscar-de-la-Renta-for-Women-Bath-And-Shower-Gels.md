    <li> My all time favorite.</li>
    <li> Great body wash; smells fresh, skin soft</li>
    <li> This is my favorite bath gel and I love the packaging. It&#x27;s silky, matches my perfume and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body bath for over 30 years.  There&#x27;s nothing that smells better, with a VERY clean fragrance, very light, not heavy at all, as so much perfume is today.  The body bath is my fave, although the Oscar perfume is also light, and the body lotion, which I use on my legs after my bath, is nice and creamy.  I use the bath powder after my bath too, which keeps me fresh all day.  Above all, in 30 years of use, I have  never had any complaints in a closed (office) situation, but in fact have had many compliments about my &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t bought this for years.....makes getting up in the morning delightful.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on schedule and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was ordered as a gift for my wife.  My wife really likes the product and that is what is important to me.  So, eventhough it was a gift for my wife we both get to enjoy the product, because after she uses the product she sure smells nice.</li>
    <li> What can I say ladies except that it&#x27;s the Bomb!! Leaves your skin feeling velvety soft and that special someone close to you will notice the delicate fragrance and your soft to the touch skin! Love it!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 85 year old mother in law for Christmas.  (She just doesn&#x27;t need more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.). She absolutely loved it.  She  told me that she feels so &amp;#34;pampered&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> love the door delivery.  Made this a wonderful surprize.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance. Very pleased that I was able to find this product on your site.</li>
    <li> The wash is fabulous but the pump did not work. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This body soap is top quality and the smell is wonderful.  Very little is needed when bathing or showering.  It is great for when shaving legs.  I love this product, it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Good, product is a little old and has a bit of an old smell to it but still good.</li>
    <li> Love it. The only problem is in the shower it is Hard to pump out the gel. But it is so wonderful I don&#x27;t mind. Wish I could find it cheaper. I&#x27;ve been using this line for years. Thanks for letting me find the perfume and body wash.</li>
    <li> The body bath is okay.  The scent doesn&#x27;t really smell like the ones you buy at a fine store such as Dilliards.  The scent smells like the brand new dolls or barbies back in the day (60&#x27;s-70&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> She has been using this for years. Great price, fast ship. Will be ordering more. Nordstrom must be wondering why their sales dropped</li>
    <li> Will let you know after I use the perfume, body powder, body lotion and now the body, bath how wonderful it is</li>
    <li> I met the Oscar fragrance in the 1970&#x27;s and have used it since.  The treatment products are hard to find so when I do it creates much excitement.  This body wash scents and softens and followed by Oscar lotion and or body powder leaves you feeling very feminine and pampered.  Viva Oscar!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, great S&amp;H.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for many, many years, I love it &amp; my family always tells me how nice it is.</li>
    <li> I love Oscar and this body bath is just great! Just the right amount of scent and lasts all day!</li>
