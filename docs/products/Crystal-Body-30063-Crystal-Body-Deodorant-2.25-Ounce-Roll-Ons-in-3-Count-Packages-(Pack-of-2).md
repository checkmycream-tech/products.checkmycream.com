      <li>I was incredibly apprehensive when I bought the Crystal roll-on deodorant.</li>
      <li>not an antiperspirant but is a great deodorant.</li>
      <li>and it is great.  </li>
      <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
      <li>Really great product</li>
      <li>A good choice for those looking for safer health and beauty products.</li>
      <li>This stuff&#x27;s just as good and so inexpensive on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have no idea how it manages to get so many good reviews!</li>
      <li>br /&gt;I am very pleased and have used it for a couple of years now.  </li>
      <li>Amazingly, and perhaps unintentionally, it also works for me as an antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>I would change every so often as it would not be as effective.  </li>
      <li>This is probably the best product I have ever used on my body - as a skeptic of natural products, this one has made me a believer.</li>
      <li>It is VERY effective and you can feel good about using a product that is natural.  </li>
      <li>My first impression was it felt like I was wearing no deodorant at all, which was a very nice feeling.</li>
      <li>glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>And the price on Amazon is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I will tell you I am over 45 and have been wearing deodarant for many years.  </li>
      <li>After some more reading I found out there was a liquid roll-on version of this product and a lot of people were vouching for its quality.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>and this is my favorite of the two.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, I wish it could also stop perspiration, but otherwise I am most pleased.</li>
      <li>I was still nervous and was checking every hour to make sure this stuff was still working...</li>
      <li>Need I say more?</li>
      <li>, just one more thing.</li>
      <li>With Crystal, I am completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and I just love it.  </li>
      <li>ok I think.</li>
      <li>I came across a Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant and enjoyed using that, for the most part, but when it ran out I looked for another alternative.</li>
      <li>In fact, it lasted throughout the day even during my most stressful days.</li>
      <li>But, I think that is a worthwhile trade-off for the health benefits of eliminating chemicals and aluminum chlorohydrate.</li>
      <li>I loved it at first and would still love it except now</li>
      <li>Let me get straight to the point: Crystal is by far the best product I have ever used for controlling BO.  </li>
      <li>It works all day 99% of the time and is easy to apply.      </li>
      <li>but what i believe is happening is the product is so effective it kills all the good bacteria allowing the yeast to multiply.</li>
      <li>when I go to the gym at 5:30 a.m., I&#x27;ve had the stuff on for about 21 hours already, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.    </li>
      <li>And I sweat less than most people!!!     </li>
      <li>Now, I don&#x27;t use it during the warmer months, simply because the huge pools of sweat under my arms aren&#x27;t too attractive, but I don&#x27;t *</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use it every day, the head dries up and you have to break it free with your fingers or it will sand your armpit,</li>
      <li>Knocks out order and is very cost effective.</li>
      <li>Although it isn&#x27;t the best anti-perspirant, it definitely controls odor without strong chemicals and no harsh scents.</li>
      <li>original Crystal rock required putting it under running water to activate it.</li>
      <li>The liquid is unscented, dries clean and has been working through the summer heat.  </li>
      <li>I was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t be able to control the odor, but to my surprise it really did.</li>
      <li>No bad ingredients.</li>
      <li>It also seems somewhat effective in controlling wetness, even though it is not touted as such.  </li>
      <li>I still smelled like I had just gotten out of the shower with no artificial scent.</li>
      <li>This is useful when you use perfume.</li>
      <li>In addition, its a safe product for my husband who is aluminum sensitive.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant was as useful to me as not using any at all.</li>
      <li>As the days got hotter and more humid, I found myself having to clean under my arms and reapplying around two or three times daily.  </li>
      <li>I would say that this product should be okay for most, but for those with extra sensitive skin, you may one to purchase 1 in a trial run, and not buy in bulk.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice not to have to run around scratching my armpits like a monkey.     </li>
      <li>Dries quickly, no residue, you smell good all day.</li>
      <li>My husband is also wearing it and likes it very much.  </li>
      <li>I first tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine lemongrass scent and that yielded unfriendly results.</li>
      <li>Simply put, I love it.</li>
      <li>My whole family is now using it!</li>
      <li>I first tried Mitchum which worked very well, however it felt like I had plastic wrap under my arm all day - powerful but chafing.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m really stinky!</li>
      <li>The biggest problem with Crystal stick, was it didn&#x27;t last much more than 6 hours</li>
      <li>Not only did it poop out halfway through the day, it also made my skin MORE irritated if I re-applied it.</li>
      <li>I see people saying this product doesn&#x27;t work, and criticizing it for something it was never intended to do in the first place.  </li>
      <li>I have put it on after a night-time shower and didn&#x27;t reapply the next morning, and I stayed smell free!  </li>
      <li>What I like most about the crystal is that in the roll on form it is simple to use.  </li>
      <li>I never thought this natural stuff would work, but it works better than my old deodorant without the aluminum.  </li>
      <li>But I saved the best part for last: NO MORE DEODORANT SPOTS ON ANY OF YOUR CLOTHES!  </li>
      <li>There are tons of overwhelmingly positive reviews -- believe the hype, they&#x27;re all true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It will hurt the first time but if you use it regularly it really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
      <li>As the day went on I noticed it not only wasn&#x27;t itching, but I wasn&#x27;t sweating much at all - surprising since this product doesn&#x27;t actually block your pores from sweating like antiperspirants</li>
      <li>I had almost given up until I found Crystal which is as good (if not better) than products *with* aluminum.  </li>
      <li>Really helps control perspiration odor without perfume-type cover up.</li>
      <li>and that is the real problem with just about any anti perspirant.</li>
      <li>Totally fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I will admit I really had no faith in it not being an anti-perspirant</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>This really works.  </li>
      <li>Plus you won&#x27;t have an armpit hair shadow, which is really unattractive.</li>
      <li>price that I got it for on Amazon was the very lowest I have ever paid.</li>
      <li>This is so much simpler.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care about that aspect.  </li>
      <li>Also, the bottle is a comfortable roll-on, which I actually prefer to sprays.  </li>
      <li>Like, I put it on ONCE in the morning and it works for the whole day.     </li>
      <li>The odor is just neutralized, which is really all you need.</li>
      <li>This product really does work.  </li>
      <li>It really works, both the stick and roll-on.  </li>
      <li>Even though, there is not yet any scientific evidence that aluminum chlorohydrate and other chemicals found in antiperspirant deodorants cause breast cancer or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, I believe reducing the chemicals and metals that we introduce to our bodies, can only be a good thing.  </li>
      <li>My significant other was using this product in the solid form, and I really enjoyed it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it is great.  The sale and delivery where excellant.  Karin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice not to have to run around scratching my armpits like a monkey.     I tried a couple of other kinds of natural unscented deodorants. One smelled like pine trees (Tom&#x27;s) and the other smelled like beer (Kiss my face). And considering that neither of them worked, they both smelled like body odor after a few hours. This was in the winter, too. And I sweat less than most people!!!     I purposely waited for summer and for my trip to Texas before writing this review. This deodorant is really REALLY scentless, I don&#x27;t look like a monkey, and IT ACTUALLY WORKS. Like, I put it on ONCE in the morning and it works for the whole day.     Wicked Awesome!!!     *** I am editing this review because I remember having read others about people who developed rashes. I found that in my case the rash was caused by a combination of using this deodorant and shaving my armpits. If I were you I would try an epilator before giving up completely. It will hurt the first time but if you use it regularly it really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Plus you won&#x27;t have an armpit hair shadow, which is really unattractive. Once I started using the epilator the rash went away. I hope this helps at least some of you with sensitive skin. :)</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  It succeeds where every deodorant has failed in some major aspect.  There are tons of overwhelmingly positive reviews -- believe the hype, they&#x27;re all true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed the ball applicator can become stuck if I don&#x27;t use the deodorant for a period.  This is not typically an issue for deodorant I keep at home for daily use.  But this is a /minor/ irritant for me when I travel with my toiletry bag where I store this in there.  Every time I travel, I have to \\&quot;un-stick\\&quot; the deodorant before I can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also worry it will be less effective if I put a shirt on too soon after application -- does this need to dry?  As it is, I usually wait a few minutes to air dry before I put a shirt on.  I will probably end up purchasing [[ASIN:B001ET765S Crystal Spray Body Deodorant]] in hopes a fine mist will dry faster than a rolled-on liquid solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  the [[ASIN:B001ET765S Crystal Spray Body Deodorant]] is no better at drying faster.</li>
    <li> This deodorant was as useful to me as not using any at all. I have no idea how it manages to get so many good reviews! Its expensive and ineffective, in my case anyway.  I have only used it for two days after showering but it does not work on me. Maybe I&#x27;m really stinky!</li>
    <li> Pros:    1. No alluminium chlorohydrate (Mentioned on the cover)  2. Approved by cancer associations (Mentioned on the cover)  3. No residue after application  4. Totally fragrance free. This is useful when you use perfume. I used to have a problem wherein the deo smell would mixup with my perfume fragrance, resulting in an odd smell.  5. No irritation after application.    Cons:  1. Armpits do tend to start smelling, maybe after 5 hours of application. But thats ok I think. Hence 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Like many here I loved it for 6 months then developed a horrible rash.  Unlike others here, the rash isn&#x27;t going away, and I&#x27;m going to have to go to the doctor to get it checked out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d tried \\&quot;the rock\\&quot; products before, and they just didn&#x27;t protect long enough during the day. So, I was skeptical about this. But, I tried it, and guess what? IT WORKS! How about that? I&#x27;m still amazed!</li>
    <li> I have tried other natural deodorants without success.  This really works.  I have put it on after a night-time shower and didn&#x27;t reapply the next morning, and I stayed smell free!  I was beginning to think that I had a major odor problem, but other products that I tried just did not work for me.  This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these, the roll-on version, for about 10 years now.  It is the best deodorant on the market. Amazingly, and perhaps unintentionally, it also works for me as an antiperspirant. Even when I bike or run. Need I say more? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, just one more thing. I wish I had the courage to tell all those people whose BO endlessly irritates me that there is a solution.</li>
    <li> I heard this mentioned as a recommendation by Howard Stern on the radio and glad I tried it. My wife and I both use it and buy our supplies from Amazon for the best pricing. Really helps control perspiration odor without perfume-type cover up.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased that this product works as good as regular anti-perspirants w/o the dangerous chemicals! I will only use this product from now on!</li>
    <li> I hate anti-perspirant with something of a passion. It cakes going on, it burns after you shave, it leaves marks on your clothing ... I have little luck with it.    I came across a Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant and enjoyed using that, for the most part, but when it ran out I looked for another alternative. My significant other was using this product in the solid form, and I really enjoyed it. However, living in a college dorm, it&#x27;s not always practical to bring your deodorant into the bathroom with you to run it under a sink, so I purchased the roll-on version.    Simply put, I love it. I apply it twice a day, maximum. Now, I don&#x27;t use it during the warmer months, simply because the huge pools of sweat under my arms aren&#x27;t too attractive, but I don&#x27;t *smell*. Just let it dry a little before putting on a top and you&#x27;ll be fine.    One other plus--I have another salt deodorant, but this one does NOT burn when I put it on after I shave my underarms. I think that&#x27;s fantastic. I highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Even though, there is not yet any scientific evidence that aluminum chlorohydrate and other chemicals found in antiperspirant deodorants cause breast cancer or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, I believe reducing the chemicals and metals that we introduce to our bodies, can only be a good thing.  So, in my quest to find an alternative to everyday antiperspirant deodorants with chemicals and aluminum chlorohydrate, I tried quite a few natural alternatives without much luck.  The only one that even somewhat cut it as a deodorant was the Crystal stick.  The biggest problem with Crystal stick, was it didn&#x27;t last much more than 6 hours and it was a pain to apply (Running under water).  Then I found the Crystal roll-on over a year ago, and I&#x27;ll never use anything else.  It works all day 99% of the time and is easy to apply.      If you are like me and have used an antiperspirant deodorant all you life, it is a little weird getting used to a plain deodorant, since you will naturally sweat and have damp armpits most of the time.  But, I think that is a worthwhile trade-off for the health benefits of eliminating chemicals and aluminum chlorohydrate.</li>
    <li> I bought the Crystal for Men mineral salts stick at the drug store back in October &#x27;07.  I didn&#x27;t know to dry it off after use, so it started deteriorating, so that eventually when I applied it, the craggy edges pulled my hair (sorry if that&#x27;s TMI).  Then I read the reviews for the roll-on here on Amazon and decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and I just love it.  I shower in the morning after the gym, so when I go to the gym at 5:30 a.m., I&#x27;ve had the stuff on for about 21 hours already, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  Yeah, I sweat, and a lot, but I don&#x27;t stink, not at all.  It&#x27;s so freeing to wear this and when you take a shower you don&#x27;t have to use steel wool to get products like Mitchum anti-perspirant off your skin.  It really works, both the stick and roll-on.  I&#x27;m a total convert.  By the way, there&#x27;s a fancy body product store here in Seattle - L&#x27;Occcutaine or something like that - that sells a mineral salt rock - for $21 - yes twenty one dollars.  What a rip.  This stuff&#x27;s just as good and so inexpensive on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Knocks out order and is very cost effective. The problem is that i get a rash from it each and every time i tried to use it. Im a guy so i dont shave my arm pits so its not that. I once was on a forum which was discussing natural deodorants and this came up. There seem to be a small percentage that also develops this \\&quot;rash\\&quot; with accompanied small welts in my case. Ive tried this a couple of times and same results. I once even waited about 6 months and tried to use it and still the rash appeared.  I tried using it every other day and still same rash with welts. The rash usually appears after about 3 weeks of use.  If anyone is reading this i believe the rash to be some sort of yeast/candida infection. If left on its own it took a little over 2 weeks before it went away. At few times i did treat it with Tinactin and it went away quicker. I did go to my Dr once, however by the time he saw me it was almost gone. Though he also commented on it and thought it was some sort of yeast infection. Im no Dr but what i believe is happening is the product is so effective it kills all the good bacteria allowing the yeast to multiply. Since it doesnt stop you from perspiring bingo you have a over abundance of yeast. I want to add to whomever is using this for the first time it usually takes 2-3 days of use before it starts to work. So for that time period your arm pits will smell. For those few who may try this if you get a rash i suggest try some type of antifungal powder or cream. Of course you can check with your Dr office as well.  If you happen to get a rash personally I would discontinue use because most likely it wasnt a fluke and you will continue to get it like me.</li>
    <li> I got tired of the \\&quot;Cool Rush\\&quot; smell with my current deodorant, so I started looking for something unscented. I first tried Mitchum which worked very well, however it felt like I had plastic wrap under my arm all day - powerful but chafing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I started looking around on some forums and came across \\&quot;The Crystal Stick\\&quot; - I was more than skeptical that rubbing a rock under my arm would work better than chemical deodorants. After some more reading I found out there was a liquid roll-on version of this product and a lot of people were vouching for its quality.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I picked up a roll-on bottle and gave it a try. My first impression was it felt like I was wearing no deodorant at all, which was a very nice feeling. Then I started getting worried - I&#x27;ve forgotten deodorant in the past, and it can get itchy when I start sweating. As the day went on I noticed it not only wasn&#x27;t itching, but I wasn&#x27;t sweating much at all - surprising since this product doesn&#x27;t actually block your pores from sweating like antiperspirants/deodorants do. I was still nervous and was checking every hour to make sure this stuff was still working... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By the end of the day I still smelled like I had just gotten out of the shower with no artificial scent. This is probably the best product I have ever used on my body - as a skeptic of natural products, this one has made me a believer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard about this deodorant for years but only got to trying it out recently.  I&#x27;d been using Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; herbal deodorant for several months, which worked really well for me up until summer hit.  As the days got hotter and more humid, I found myself having to clean under my arms and reapplying around two or three times daily.  After a while of that, I called an end to our run together, as I didn&#x27;t feel Burt&#x27;s was doing enough for me anymore.  So, I picked up this deodorant, remembering that I&#x27;d never heard any bad reviews from anyone I knew who tried it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, this is one of the best switch-overs I&#x27;ve ever made.  The liquid is unscented, dries clean and has been working through the summer heat.  I haven&#x27;t had to reapply once, and I normally sweat a lot.  Also, the bottle is a comfortable roll-on, which I actually prefer to sprays.  If you&#x27;re on the look-out for a new natural deodorant, I definitely recommend this one.  Just keep in mind that this is not an anti-perspirant, so you will still sweat.  The odor is just neutralized, which is really all you need.</li>
    <li> This product is *excellent*.  I tried to get away from deodarants with aluminum, but they did not work at all.  I had almost given up until I found Crystal which is as good (if not better) than products *with* aluminum.  Buy with confidence and be kinder to your body at the same time!</li>
    <li> Let me get straight to the point: Crystal is by far the best product I have ever used for controlling BO.  I have tried several brands of deodorant in my experience (Old Spice, Axe, etc.) and none of them work as well as this product.  I&#x27;ve read several reviews for this product around the net, and a lot of people are either braindead or totally missing the point.  I see people saying this product doesn&#x27;t work, and criticizing it for something it was never intended to do in the first place.  This product is not meant to prevent you from sweating; this is NOT an antiperspirant.  Honestly though, none of the antiperspirants I have ever used in the past really decreased my sweat levels in the first place, so I don&#x27;t really care about that aspect.  What I do care about, however, is the fact that I can go play my drums for about 2-3 hours, be absolutely DRENCHED in sweat, and still be totally stink-free.  Another terrific thing is that it has no fragrance, so if you wear perfume or cologne you won&#x27;t have conflicting scents.  It&#x27;s also all-natural, so if you buy into all that \\&quot;go green, stop global warming\\&quot; hippy crap, it will help boost your ego and further enforce your false notion that you are saving the world.  All I care about is the fact that it works, and works well.  But I saved the best part for last: NO MORE DEODORANT SPOTS ON ANY OF YOUR CLOTHES!  Do yourself a favor and pick this product up.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I have a hard time finding products that I will not develop an allergy too.  Initially, I believed this product was the answer. Its an excellent deodorant and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with perspiration. However, after about 4 months of use, I developed a severe rash to this product, welts and all, and had to discontinue its use. I would say that this product should be okay for most, but for those with extra sensitive skin, you may one to purchase 1 in a trial run, and not buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product.  I tend to sweat alot and worry about odor.  This product really does work.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems.  Although it isn&#x27;t the best anti-perspirant, it definitely controls odor without strong chemicals and no harsh scents.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but it does. Dries quickly, no residue, you smell good all day. No bad ingredients. A good choice for those looking for safer health and beauty products.</li>
    <li> I have the same problem as the reviewer and her husband. I loved it at first and would still love it except now when I use it I start to itch under my arms. It is an uncontrollable itch and after scratching, red bumps start to appear and really irritate my skin. I wish I knew what is wrong because it really does work for controlling odor. It doesn&#x27;t control perspiration but that is O.K because you want to allow the toxins to be released through sweat. It is the only deodorant I have tried that really controls odor and believe me I have tried them all. After stopping use of it the itching and rash goes away after 3 - 4 days.</li>
    <li> I recently broke out in a rash from a deodorant I was using (Secret Platinum Vanilla Chai, for those interested)and that had never happened to me before. I went through two other natural deodorants before finding this one. I first tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine lemongrass scent and that yielded unfriendly results. Not only did it poop out halfway through the day, it also made my skin MORE irritated if I re-applied it. I was incredibly apprehensive when I bought the Crystal roll-on deodorant. I was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t be able to control the odor, but to my surprise it really did. In fact, it lasted throughout the day even during my most stressful days. Oh, and did I mention my rash is now gone? If you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashing, I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I give it only 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration. But, I think only aluminum chlorohydrate can do that and that is the real problem with just about any anti perspirant. I am SEVERLY allergic to aluminum chlorohydrate and have been for years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of the non-aluminum chlorohydrate products that I have tried over the years have eventually caused me irritation and redness.  This does not. What I like most about the crystal is that in the roll on form it is simple to use.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The original Crystal rock required putting it under running water to activate it. This is so much simpler. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and have used it for a couple of years now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The price that I got it for on Amazon was the very lowest I have ever paid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, I wish it could also stop perspiration, but otherwise I am most pleased. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the roll on and crystal stick and this is my favorite of the two.  It is VERY effective and you can feel good about using a product that is natural.  It also seems somewhat effective in controlling wetness, even though it is not touted as such.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this works.  I will tell you I am over 45 and have been wearing deodarant for many years.  I would change every so often as it would not be as effective.  A while back I noticed it was not working very well at all anymore and saw this and took a chance.  I will admit I really had no faith in it not being an anti-perspirant but I was shocked.  I absolutely love it.  My husband is also wearing it and likes it very much.  Really great product and I highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is the BEST deoderant EVER!!!!  No Aluminum at all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty</li>
    <li> I read about this product in the book Easy Green Living and now that I am on a &#x27;green&#x27;, all-natural kick I thought I would give it a try- albeit very skeptically. This deodorant is the best! I am a very, very active person. I bike everyday, weight-lift a few times a week, take yoga classes, and still have time to walk my dogs. I have tried every anti-antiperspirant/deodorant out there, especially the kinds that say they are for sports. I have never found one that worked which meant I was harming my body for nothing! After reading the labels I say they all had aluminum! Well, into the trash they went. With Crystal, I am completely satisfied. It is really weird because I still sweat, slightly, but there is no odor at all, even at the end of the day. And, I don&#x27;t feel the need to re-apply all day either. It baffles me, but it works!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY natural deodorant that works!  I have tried everything and have very sensitive skin.  All other deodorants make me break out under my arms or have stopped working by 3pm.  I can even apply it after shaving without it burning my skin.  I apply it after a shower in the morning.  I rub a lot on until my whole underarm is wet.  That seems to help it last longer.  There is some break-through body odor by the next morning, but who cares, that&#x27;s 24 hours later.  Take another shower.  Absolutely love it.  And the price on Amazon is fantastic!  As long as they make this, I will buy it.</li>
    <li> not an antiperspirant but is a great deodorant.</li>
    <li> Hypoallergenic and a lot easier to apply than using the solid rock.  If you don&#x27;t use it every day, the head dries up and you have to break it free with your fingers or it will sand your armpit, but otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.  The roll-on works well over hair (whereas the spray just drips all over the place!).  Don&#x27;t bother to use if you have not bathed, however:  it&#x27;s not strong enough to combat an existing bacterial layer.</li>
    <li> I never thought this natural stuff would work, but it works better than my old deodorant without the aluminum.  My whole family is now using it!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I bought this product, but for 5 or 6 bucks I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It is definitely different in appearance - a clear rock- but man does this stuff work!  I just spent the whole day working outside in 90 degree heat and unbearable humidity, but I do not smell AT ALL.  Nothing!  And though it doesn&#x27;t claim to keep you dry, it worked for me.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works for most of the day if I&#x27;m not too active.  With a lot of activity and subsequent sweating, I found that after about three hours it didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
    <li> My husband and I highly recommend this product.  He&#x27;s an HVAC installer (which means extreme heat, while in attics during the summer) and has zero odor problems with this by the time he gets home.  I&#x27;m a SAHM, with 2 dogs (so, pretty active) and also have no odor problems.  In addition, its a safe product for my husband who is aluminum sensitive.  It also doesn&#x27;t irritate, or cause constant itching after shaving my armpit area.</li>
