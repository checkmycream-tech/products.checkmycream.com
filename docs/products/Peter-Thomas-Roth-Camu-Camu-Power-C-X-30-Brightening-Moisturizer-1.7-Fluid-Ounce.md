      <li>Really nice formula.</li>
      <li>This is nice.  </li>
      <li>It is a joke and a HUGE, HUGE Rip off!!!</li>
      <li>On top of this cream, I use a very light touch of a mineral foundation but to be honest, after using this product for a month, at my age, I can go without make-up!  </li>
      <li>Brightened my skin made it look and feel softer , smells good and is very light and easily washed off .</li>
      <li>I have been using peter thomas roth since 2005 and this stuff is by far the best!</li>

      <li>i&#x27;ve got really nice skin........ and want to keep it that way :)</li>
      <li>have fair, sensitive, combination skin and this has been great.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many moisturizers over the years and this one is the best by far.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this product it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
      <li>My skin looks quite &#x27;rosy&#x27; after using this (which is why I use it at night) but it looks its very best the next morning after the more intensive treatment -- smooth, bright and glowing.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff, and all Peter Thomas Roth Products....</li>
      <li>Works even better with Dermalight Spa Sonic</li>
      <li>Love that I can use this morning and night.</li>
      <li>Been using it for about 3 weeks and am now choosing to go without makeup most of the time.</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer</li>
      <li>Lessened my breakouts, and has given my skin more of a glow.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Excellent facial cream which moisturizes and brightens skin perfectly!!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such an awesome product!</li>

      <li>That&#x27;s okay...</li>
      <li>I just wish the price was more affordable.</li>
      <li>but I like this better.</li>
      <li>And once it &amp;#34;soaks in&amp;#34; at night, I put the PTR anti-aging night cream on top.</li>
      <li>so if you like a more matte finish this is not the cream for you.</li>
      <li>I should probably start getting into a better skin regimen at the age of 30.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My skin texture has changed for the better</li>
      <li>Talk about moist, soct, smooth, lighter skin!</li>
      <li>I bought this product as well as the matching serum on the recommendation of a friend who had the most luminous skin, as well as her preferred foundation (whose brand I will not name here.)</li>
      <li>so I have to add another moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
      <li>This is an ok product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s such an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy it is absorbed in the skin very quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Very nourishing. Like the Orange/citrus scent. Don&#x27;t notice a big difference to the brightening effects as it claims but have only been using it for a few weeks.  Wondering if there will be issues with product waste due to the pump (you have to push down on the top to dispense product...  Not sure if that pump can be removed.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product so I can&#x27;t comment on the skin &amp;#34;brightening effect&amp;#34; however I it seems to be an excellent moisturizer. I do notice that my skin has a softer look and feel.</li>
    <li> Awesome for mature skin.</li>
    <li> Works great on my skin! My skin hasn&#x27;t been dry since I started using the product and my skin has been clearer and brighter</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will order again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Amazon after trying a sample from Sephora. I loved the sample and how it felt on my face and appeared to be working just from the few days I was using the sample. After that I decided to purchaase it. However, I was trying to save money by ordering from Amazon as the price at Sephora is $70+, and it was on here for $45. I received it from Amazon and the jar I recieved must have been old or expired as it caused by face to break out in non-pimple bumps. This is typically a reaction that I would get if I use an old product. When this happened I went straight to Sephora and just paid the price and I&#x27;ve been using the new jar for about 4 days now and have had no reactions. I&#x27;m returning the jar I got from Amazon. I highly recommend this cream though. It&#x27;s not overly thick and smells like a tangerine. I have very sensitive skin and usually will break out with heavy creams. This cream (the jar from Sephora) caused no breakouts and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky on my skin. It&#x27;s also very hydrating and I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t wake up with any creases from sleeping either. My skin looks smoother and brighter and softer. No cream is going to a miracle, but I truly believe this cream does what it says! Just be sure you buy from somewhere like Sephora though.</li>
    <li> Great product with poor packaging .&lt;br /&gt;In order to use the product has to break the container because the patent issuing cream does not work .&lt;br /&gt;Bad product .&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money !</li>
    <li> I love this stuff....it really brightens my complexion and makes it appear &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34;. I use some other PTR products and this just ices the cake. Use it over the moisturizer for the fullest effects.  The only thing that would make it better would be to see when it gets low , so that I don&#x27;t run out.  I will definetely continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Just arrived this week. Have only used it twice. Face feels silky.  I have lots of face creams. I like to try different ones. This is nice.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer  plus the camu camu lightens dark spots.  My 4th bottle. I already put the  camu camu line. . Love  it</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this with the camu camu Brightening Serum. I use these 2 products every night and it has made a difference in my skin. My skins softer and my pores smaller.</li>
    <li> Works even better with Dermalight Spa Sonic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now. I love it! What I first noticed was the instant brightening effect and how well it moisturized my skin, lasting through the entire day. Also, the hyperpigmentation that once existed on my cheek area has deminished, if not completely. Pore size also greatly decreased. This product holds so many of the key ingrediants one should look for when chosing a anti aging cream. I highly recommend! Too add...I&#x27;m 41with fair, dry, sensitive skin and being an aesthetician I&#x27;ve definitely used my share of profucts. I&#x27;ve decided this will be a new staple in my regimen.</li>
    <li> This is an ok product.  Moisturizes well, but I&#x27;m not sure about the brightening effect.  I&#x27;ve used the serum as well, and think that does a much better job at brightening.  I would probably not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Bought this cream for my wife and she&#x27;s happy with it received it early and way cheaper than the store thank you</li>
    <li> I must say that at my age, I have tried nearly every face cream, from high end to low end, but this face cream is truly amazing.  After only one month of using the cream, I have people stopping me to ask me what I am using!  They tell me that my face has a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; and \\&quot;brightness\\&quot; to it and I have never had a compliment like this before. I am 61 years old and many people tell me I look like I am in my early 50s which is very nice to hear!  On top of this cream, I use a very light touch of a mineral foundation but to be honest, after using this product for a month, at my age, I can go without make-up!  Must, must try this and I never provide reviews of this nature, especially not all stars!  I am going to go in now and purchase another bottle because I simply cannot be without this cream!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is a fake it doesn&#x27;t smell the same or look the same as the moisturizer I have bought from sephora</li>
    <li> Excellent facial cream which moisturizes and brightens skin perfectly!!&lt;br /&gt;Also a perfect cream for women with melasma.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the brightening serum you can have best results.</li>
    <li> An amazing product. My face is now more even tone since the dark marks have disappeared.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I used it for a month or two and had great results.  I do not use it every day now because I don&#x27;t need it.  I highly recommend this product.  I have used Philosophy Turbo Booster C Powder but I like this better.</li>
    <li> Love love this stuff!! I live in the desert and my skin feels amazing. My skin texture has changed for the better</li>
    <li> When I put the cream on it absorbs quickly into my skin, which is good, but then my skin still feels dry so I have to add another moisturizer on top of it.  For the price, I expected more.</li>
    <li> This product is not a miracle worker but it does what it says it will do.  A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Brightened my skin made it look and feel softer , smells good and is very light and easily washed off .</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money on skin care over the years and read reviews and bought stuff that I realized I was not happy with after a couple weeks but this one has been one of the best I&#x27;ve used in a long time, I would like to see more of this line sold in Department Stores even Sephora. I think women over 40 should definitely give it a try, it is so silky and smooth and smells great! I will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I get asked at least once a day what I use on my face. It makes my skin glow. This stuff is powerful!</li>
    <li> I use it as night cream just for the case the vitamin c would be sun light sensitive. So far love it</li>
    <li> Loved this cream. I have not used Peter Thomas Roth products a whole lot so I was worried about ordering it, but the cream was great for my skin.  I could see the difference the very next morning. So I ordered the PTR Hyaluronic acid as well. Now I apply it after applying a concoction of Peter Thomas Roth Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C powder (from Cosmedix). I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Peter Thomas Roth while traveling as one of the hotels carried the bath products in the rooms. Since I was looking for a good vitamin C moisturizer, decided to try PTR&#x27;s Camu Camu, and I am very happy I did. This cream has a wonderful orange scent and absorbs well. I have been using it for a few weeks now and my face feels incredibly soft and smooth, and feels hydrated and healthy.  Felt that way as soon as I began using. Will definitely continue to purchase. P.S. I use this at night and use PTR&#x27;s Max All Day moisture defense cream with SPF 30 in the morning. The combination is a TKO (total knock out).</li>
    <li> This is fabulous moisturizer! My skin has never felt as hydrated as it does when I use this product. I am a true convert! Plenty of product in the jar, I have been using it for over a month both morning and night, and there is still enough to last me another month. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!!!  I have used this product for almost a year and no one ever believes I am 51...  Ten - twelve years younger is what I hear!!  My face never felt or looked better!</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to refresh and renew my 64 yr old face! Love it!  Smells good too!  I use it am &amp; pm....And once it &amp;#34;soaks in&amp;#34; at night, I put the PTR anti-aging night cream on top.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of products and none really seem to make a difference however this has brightened by complexion to the point where people are complimenting how good my skin looks. While I do notice a brighter smoother complexion I don&#x27;t notice any improvements with wrinkles or fine lines that why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> After the first use I saw a difference in the brightness of my face and felt very moisturized as well. I use it AM and PM.Very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> Talk about moist, soct, smooth, lighter skin! Love Peter Thomas Roth products!!  For me they all work.</li>
    <li> Gives you a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and with all of the research on Vit C hopefully will work in the long term!  Apply Vit C after Retinol products have been absorbed-supposedly ramps up the effects of Retinol.</li>
    <li> i got it for my mom and she likes it. we see the difference in the skin texture after few days of usage</li>
    <li> This is my third container of the Camu Camu and I love the effects it has on my skin.  It&#x27;s smoother, softer, brighter and I&#x27;ve had people ask me what&#x27;s my secret to looking ageless.  I only wish it contained an SPF so I wouldn&#x27;t have to apply another product.</li>
    <li> Extremely nourishing and moisturizing for my skin. So thankful I found this product and the price is much better than other beauty stores. My skin has improved tremendously after using this product and it is more beautiful than it has ever been! Soft and radiant!! I give it my complete recommendation and it will become your favorite beauty product. Worth every penny IMO.</li>
    <li> I am a 46 year old woman and I feel I have tried everything \\&quot;under the sun\\&quot; and when I say that...I mean it!  This by far is THE best product I have come across in nearly 10 years and I thought I was already using the best.  I am a nutrition student and recently started studying camu camu.  I found this product on a google search, immediately ordered it and fell in love.  My friends and family constantly tell me how great my skin looks and that I am aging freakishly well.  I take good care of my skin and body, but this product by far and away is the biggest difference in how I look and feel lately.  I noticed a difference in the FIRST day!  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this one and if you buy it, you will not be disappointed with it in any way, shape or form.  It&#x27;s worth the price and compared to other products it&#x27;s really not even that much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the same time I ordered the&lt;br /&gt; Laser-Free kit from same company. It works wonders for the skin. The products work so well together. Results are almost immediate. I will reorder this again.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I had anticipated</li>
    <li> The product is good, it smells like vitamin C and has a nice consistency.  The problem is with the packaging, the lid opens and closes counterclockwise and is always getting jammed.  It is as if the seal is stripped.  I have to get my husband to fight with it each time I use. I would not purchase again, this is a major flaw.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for two days and I am stunned at how beautiful my skin looks. Pores minimized, skin is clear and bright and moisturized in a way I have never experienced before. It also self dispenses just the small amount needed so as not to expose the vitamin c to the air. I can stop looking for a great face cream, finally!</li>
    <li> I love it. I had never tried this moisturizer before, and it is fabulous. It leaves your skin soft and smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for almost two weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic difference in the pigmentation of my skin. My acne marks are almost gone and the dark circles around my eyes is gone. My neck and face are actually one color now since using this and I rub some on my lips at night so it evens out the skin tone. This cost double the price at sephora so I&#x27;m glad I found it on amazon for half the price; I am really loving this product, because it works and does what it says. I also use this with the PTR glycolic acid face wash which is really helping the resilience in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that makes my skin feels wonderful.  I have used a few Peter Roth Thomas products and like the anti-aging Camu Camu line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan and regular user of other Peter Thomas Roth skincare products so I decided to try this brightening moisturizer with Camu Camu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a number of different vitamin C serums under my moisturizers and nighttime creams, so I was hopeful (based on PTR advertising) that I&#x27;d get the same benefits or better from using this [[ASIN:B008UPSGPS PTR Camu Camu Power C-X 30 Brightening Moisturizer]] which is supposed to have very high levels of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week or so, I was disappointed to find my skin texture becoming less smooth and dewy-looking.  I stuck it out though, thinking that it just needed time to do its thing.  Never happened for me.  I&#x27;m nearly through one container and I&#x27;ve decided to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others may have a different experience than mine or perhaps those who haven&#x27;t (up until now) been taking good care of their skin will notice an improvement.  But, I&#x27;m going back to using vitamin C serums followed by my favorite other PTR daytime moisturizer ([[ASIN:B0022F9NLS Mega rich Intensive Anti-aging Cellular Creme]] and night creams ([[ASIN:B0013718S2 Un-Wrinkle Night]] and [[ASIN:B00APVZFH2 Firmx Firming Night Moisturizer]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most expensive facial creams, the container looks much larger than \\&quot;what you get.\\&quot;  That&#x27;s okay...I&#x27;m used to that; however I dislike containers such as this one where you can&#x27;t see if you&#x27;re getting low on the product and also can&#x27;t get the last little bit out.  Other than that, the dispenser works well.  If you press down on any section of the wide dispensing surface, the cream will come out of a small hole in the center.  You can regulate the amount from just a teeny bit to a pea-sized amount or larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Besides using various brands of \\&quot;dropper style\\&quot; vitamin C serum, once or twice a week I make up my own high-concentrate vitamin C serum which I think works better.  I use equal parts of [[ASIN:B000EYPSB8 high-quality vitamin C powder]], pure jojoba oil, and distilled water.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to measure out, so I only mix up enough for one application (maybe 1/4 or 1/2 tsp of each ingredient).  If you make up more, keep it in the fridge and use within a few days.  After applying to my face, neck, etc, I allow it to set for a few minutes before applying a night cream over it.  My skin looks quite &#x27;rosy&#x27; after using this (which is why I use it at night) but it looks its very best the next morning after the more intensive treatment -- smooth, bright and glowing. Because it seems stronger than other serums that I&#x27;ve bought, I only use this homemade version 1-2 times a week and use the other dropper style ones on the other days.and distilled water.

    <li> Lessened my breakouts, and has given my skin more of a glow. My face feels moisturized and non greasy. Been using it for about 3 weeks and am now choosing to go without makeup most of the time. It has really improved my skin. Love that I can use this morning and night. The dispenser on the jar is fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, sensitive, combination skin and this has been great.</li>
    <li> This is great but it does make my skin quite shinny.</li>
    <li> excellent moisturizer</li>
    <li> Spent 22 years as an Esthetician and PTR was always one of my best sellers-why-it works! Nice cream, great scent (very light dissipates quick) deeply moisturizing without triggering my cystic acne. Jar is nice but you can&#x27;t tell when you&#x27;re getting low.</li>
    <li> Product was not sealed, feels like they are almost empty, product is not cheap and I want to get my money&#x27;s worth. I have ordered this product before and the jars were sealed. The product itself I love!</li>
    <li> Tried this product at an high end retail store and immediately fell in love with it.  I am a 52 year old female that was looking for a moisturizer that brightened my skin and minimizes fine lines.  The bonus on this item is the smell is to die for.  A light citrus scent that makes your skin feel wonderful.  The pump action on the jar (you remove lid and push down) ensures that the product is well controlled (dispensed) and eliminates any chance of being accidently spilled.  Found this item on amazon at the fraction of the cost as a department store. I should also note that I have had numerous people ask why I smell so good, imagine there suprise when I tell them its my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> great stuff and the jar size is fine as i&#x27;m on the 2nd month @ twice a day and there&#x27;s still half ..... face,throat&amp;chest .... yes i see a noticeable difference.... but .... i&#x27;ve used Avon in the past that i DID see this much of a change .... now i&#x27;m up for the OZ vitamin C serum.......  and will get back to you ..... @ 60 i&#x27;ve got really nice skin........ and want to keep it that way :)</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing. It smells like oranges - and in the morning there is no better smell to put you in a great mood! It goes on smooth, and does not leave your skin oily.</li>
    <li> My face feels flawless after just one use … NO LIE WHAT SO EVER i will absolutely purchase this product again and look into other Peter Thomas Roth products as well great quality</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the laser-free regenerator (LFR) moisturizer at the same time after I realized I should probably start getting into a better skin regimen at the age of 30. The camu camu made me initially break out with little whiteheads (and I never break out). I read other users had similar issues because of the high Vitamin C content so I decided to stick with it and tough it out. I use a small amount of this before applying makeup and find that my makeup looks flawless afterwards. I also stopped using this at night and the &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; went away. If you are searching for a good PTR moisturizer I definitely recommend the LFR moisturizer over this one. It feels like silk on my skin and never had an issue with any breakouts. All in all the camu camu is still a good product and you can&#x27;t go wrong with PTR.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many moisturizers over the years and this one is the best by far.  It took at few days for my skin to adjust, but once it did, my skin was clearer, brighter, and the lines less noticeable.  I am 58 years old and I would swear by this product!</li>
    <li> I use this whole line and absolutely love it. At first I felt like it was drying my skin out a little bit but after persistent use my skin feels great. I made it through a NY winter without getting dry patches. I also notice my skin tone looks a little more even. I highly recommend using this along with the camu camu serum and sleeping mask.</li>
    <li> The product has a distinct orange smell that lingers for a bit. It goes on easily. There are two problems with this cream. The first is gaining entry. There are no instructions for how to access the cream. Do you unscrew the inner white cap? Do you lift it off? Is it defective? After numerous attempts with various devices, I accidentally pressed down on the top and cream squirted out of the small hole in top of the inner top. Fine, so it&#x27;s more sanitary than sticking your (own) fingers in a cream jar, but once you get nearly finished you won&#x27;t be able to keep popping cream out and you&#x27;ll have to break into the top to get to the sides and bottom. I could not break in with screw driver, steak knife, tweezer. . .&lt;br /&gt;Second problem is the cream leaves a greasy film on my skin which is dry and flaky. It never fully absorbs. So after I apply it I must blot off the sheen. Net net for the price I won&#x27;t buy it again because of the poor design, children&#x27;s vitamin scent, and failure to absorb on my skin.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! Their &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; lid makes it impossible to use one-fourth of the contents!!!  It is a joke and a HUGE, HUGE Rip off!!!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> After dealing with lots of acne scars that never seemed to fade, I decided to give this moisturizer a try. After about a week of use, I see a tremendous difference. My skin is looks refreshed and my acne scars have faded a substantial amount. I have somewhat oily skin, so I only use at night because it does leave my skin looking oily during the day-but so far this hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> with an abundance of crèmes to pick from..... this one was fine enough. A bit pricey to indulge in regularly for me...but I had no reactions in my combination complexion!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Smells great, brightens your skin and has sunblock.</li>
    <li> too oil for me, especially in summer. when i use it in winter, i also feel uncomfortable, oil and may be suit for especially dry skin in extremely cold winter.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It moisturizes without feeling heavy in any way. As Vitamin C is degraded by air, the jar has a very effective &#x27;pump&#x27; distributor so only the squirt you use is expelled from the jar. It works well. Good, every day moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this cream a few times a week when my skin needs hydrating, it goes on well...smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I have oily combination skin, and it is fantastic.  No breakouts with this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as well as the matching serum on the recommendation of a friend who had the most luminous skin, as well as her preferred foundation (whose brand I will not name here.) The concentration of Vitamin C is supposed to be very good for your skin and I have received compliments when I use it in conjunction with the foundation (which also has brightening qualities), so I&#x27;m not quite susre which is responsible, maybe both, for my look.  In other words, I don&#x27;t know whether to recommend these two products or not.  They certainly are not doing me any harm!</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction to the vitamin C AND the retinol pm and I have beautiful skin (dermatologist confirmed) so these three products come before anything else. I am extremely happy with the results and people ask what I use.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products over the years, but Camu Camu is the best face product of any I have tried. Is great for dry skin and gives a highlight to my face.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD! MY WIFE LIKES IT.</li>
    <li> Would not use anything else!</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews on P T R Camu Camu moisturizer,&lt;br /&gt;I decided it must be the best in the universe, so I indulged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a good face cream, but the reviews?  Seemingly a bit&lt;br /&gt;once side with 5 star ratings.  I&#x27;m more objective based on&lt;br /&gt;five weeks of using the product.,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good moisturizer is only a part of my facial care program.&lt;br /&gt;Along with all the other products I incorporate, i.e. rose water&lt;br /&gt;instead of soap in the morning followed with argon oil and&lt;br /&gt;a camu camu hyaduronic acid at night, again topped with a&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer, sonic brush cleaning  three nights per week, a good&lt;br /&gt;diet, exercise and a few supplements, my skin feels and looks&lt;br /&gt;wonderful for maturing skin, perhaps with or without an expensive&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I object to with this product is the extreme pricing, and&lt;br /&gt;tricky packaging that probably makes it too easy to over use the&lt;br /&gt;amount.  There&#x27;s no way to predict when it is empty, and so as&lt;br /&gt;of last night, I am without a moisturizing face cream.  It lasted&lt;br /&gt;less than 5 weeks.  That said, after further reviewing products, I&lt;br /&gt;have just purchased Amazing organic  moisturizing cream.  Check&lt;br /&gt; out my evaluation of that product in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely read in reviews or beauty books about the fabulous&lt;br /&gt;benefits of adding facial exercises.  If we are willing to purchase&lt;br /&gt;expensive creams, we are likely interested in the best possible&lt;br /&gt;skin appearance. Amazon carries simple books on facial exercises.  Using&lt;br /&gt;my own selected facial exercises from several different books,&lt;br /&gt; 20 minutes 3 times a week, I believe I&#x27;ve knocked off at least&lt;br /&gt;a decade from facial aging. Loving my tight neck and chin, wrinkle&lt;br /&gt;free eyes, and uplifted checks.  Seriously!</li>
    <li> I like PTR products but not this one.  It&#x27;s very sticky.  Doesn&#x27;t work well under makeup so I will have to use it only at night.  No matter how little of the product I use or how long I wait for it to sink in, it never does and just sits there still feeling sticky and wet.  Needless to day you can&#x27;t put makup on top of it without looking weird, sticky and orange.  It does smell nice however.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. It has a lovely citrus-y scent...goes on feeling substantial and soothing but blends in very quickly so that it&#x27;s easy to put make up on after just a few minutes. I use it night AND day...well, sometimes just night.  It is the most unusual container I&#x27;ve ever seen for a moisturizer.  You simply push down on the top and moisturizer comes out of an opening on the top...I suppose it&#x27;s to prevent oxidation.  Hard to tell how much is left...it thought I was running out so I bought a new bottle, the old one has still kept going and it&#x27;s been weeks!</li>
    <li> I used the whole container and could never tell any difference in my skin. Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like the cream. It makes my skin dewey / shiny  and a little sticky so if you like a more matte finish this is not the cream for you. I just wish the price was more affordable.</li>
    <li> Love the smell,  i been using it for a week now, no complaints so far and i can tell my skin texture and tone has improve!!! Love it</li>
    <li> Really like the product and it does everything that it states along with what other reviews have stated.  Love the product and if in doubt, please try it.  And it smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  If your thinking about making the purchase but you think the price is too high it isn&#x27;t.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Not overly impressed. I&#x27;ve had this for almost a month now, and I haven&#x27;t seen any real difference in my skin. In fact, I seems to have more random breakouts on my forehead than I did before I started using this... and I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin before. It also leaves my skin feeling greasy all day, no matter how much or how little I use - it&#x27;s like it never fully &amp;#34;sinks in.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m only continuing to use it until my new moisturizer arrives in the mail and then I&#x27;ll toss what&#x27;s left, high price tag or no! (I&#x27;m going to try CeraVe instead, in the hopes that it&#x27;ll actually be non-greasy).</li>
    <li> Really nice formula. I will continue with this product. Hydrating for my slightly sensitive and very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love this product I will continue buying it! It had given my skin a luminous look.</li>
    <li> I should start by saying that I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  Sensitive isn&#x27;t really even a big enough word - you look at it funny and I break out or get a rash.  I had read in other reviews that sometimes it takes a bit for your skin to get used to the strength of the vitamin c in this cream, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to go through that waiting period...and I did break out from it.  I gave the remaining cream to my sister and she loves it.  I believe in vitamin c for skin...I&#x27;ve seen the results it can give me.  I just didn&#x27;t want to go through that breakout period. If you have skin that&#x27;s not as sensitive or if you don&#x27;t mind a bad patch to get to the good part, you may like this.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and all Peter Thomas Roth Products....</li>
    <li> this product has clearly been altered. it has a different smell and makeup than the original.</li>
    <li> The brown spots disappeared on my face and my skin has a noticeable difference in spots and dry areas.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in perfect shape. Smells and feels great!</li>
    <li> So far works well to soften, smooth and brighten skin.  It&#x27;s a thick, creamy feel, but smells great, sort of fruity. I hope by the time I&#x27;m finished using the entire jar, I&#x27;ll be satisfied with the results. But so far I&#x27;m pleased with the product. Giving it a five star rating. Will surely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve used some high end creams! Great scent too!</li>
    <li> Not good for very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product to even out skin tone and increase luminosity. I also use the serum which has done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome decreases break outs. Makes face look clean fresh bright like new</li>
    <li> I have been using peter thomas roth since 2005 and this stuff is by far the best! It keeps my dry skin moisturized and smells so good! I feel it has helped me with my break outs.</li>
