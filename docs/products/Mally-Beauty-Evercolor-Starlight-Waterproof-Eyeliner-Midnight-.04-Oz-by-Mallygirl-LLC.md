      <li>I have used this eyeliner for years and still love it.  </li>

      <li>With Mally&#x27;s you pay a bit more, but it seems to work better (at least for my eyes.)  </li>
      <li>DOESNT SEEM TO REALLY BE WATERPROOF .... :</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m reasonable to think that I may need to reapply once or twice a day, but need something that won&#x27;t give me racoon eyes soon after application.</li>
      <li>I have ordered Mally waterproof eyeliner pencil in the past and have been very pleased with its staying power.</li>
      <li>It doesnt stay on and smears under eyes after two hours, is it really waterproof?</li>
      <li>It is very smooth and applies dark.</li>
      <li>OK, so you&#x27;ve probably searched around for a decent eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t turn you into a raccoon with dark circles around your eyes.  </li>
      <li>This eyeliner goes on smooth and stays on all day long!</li>

    <li> I like this product but it&#x27;s not as dark as expected, and it does smear after a few hours. It does apply easily.  Not sure f it is worth the $$$ or not, but better than many drug store brands. Rimmel waterproof eyeliner is actually much less expensive, has a nice dark color, glides on easily,and lasts longer than the Mally.  Its also available at Walmart.  Save your money people and try out the Rimmel.</li>
    <li> DOESNT SEEM TO REALLY BE WATERPROOF .... :(&lt;br /&gt;I PURCHASED THIS ONCE BEFORE AND IT WAS WATERPROOF BUT NOW I REPURCHASED IT AND IT IS NOT THE SAME.. IM SO SAD ABOUT IT ....</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s mally, what more can i say</li>
    <li> I dont like the liner. It doesnt stay on and smears under eyes after two hours, is it really waterproof?</li>
    <li> I am always searching for a good dark eyeliner that will stay put throughout the day. I&#x27;m reasonable to think that I may need to reapply once or twice a day, but need something that won&#x27;t give me racoon eyes soon after application. I stare at a computer screen all day and my eyes become watery and tired easily.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say this eyeliner has hit the mark. It is very smooth and applies dark. I have been wearing it for a few days and it stays put. No smudging. No racoon eyes. I apply to the lower eye/waterline area. It works great there. I took a nap and woke up to find the eyeliner still in place with just a little smudging into the inner corner of the eye.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on the top line (above the lashes) and sadly it did not stay put. It smudges in the inner corner and also the outer corner leaving me with bloops of black &amp;#34;eye buggers&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this eyeliner. Mally is the bomb! I will definitely be trying more of her collection.</li>
    <li> OK, so you&#x27;ve probably searched around for a decent eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t turn you into a raccoon with dark circles around your eyes.  I want my eyeliner not just for the top of my eyelid, but also inside the bottom line of lashes.  And usually that&#x27;s what goes wrong.  With Mally&#x27;s you pay a bit more, but it seems to work better (at least for my eyes.)  Sometimes, I&#x27;ll dry that lower lid with a q-tip before applying the eyeliner, and that keeps the eyeliner on longer, and in-place. I prefer the Evercolor pencil rather than the automatic Mally product because the color does seem to last longer.  (Keep the pencil sharpened for best results, and by the way, the pencil itself seems to last longer than the &amp;#34;bargain-priced&amp;#34; ones.)</li>
    <li> Would not purchase again. Expected a waterproof eyeliner to stay on longer.  Put on in morning, by noon it disappeared.</li>
    <li> The color of black in this eyeliner pencil is hard to describe.  It is really deep and more like a kohl color.  I run it through my top lashes from the bottom for a pop.  You will love this eyeliner.  I have other colors in this line, but this one is the best.</li>
    <li> The eye liner when on so easy and smoothly. Beautiful color for dark eyes. Will buy again when needed. Loved it.</li>
    <li> The waterproof eyeliner works great! I usually order this item from QVC, but the price was so low w/ Amazon that I could not resist. It came in a very cute mesh bag. If you are a Mally Beauty user, this product is for you!</li>
    <li> The best - better than all the rest!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on smooth and stays on all day long!</li>
    <li> Stays put, even after strenuous exercise!  Takes a minute or two to set, so can smudge if , you put on mascara right away.</li>
    <li> I have used this eyeliner for years and still love it.  I use it to line the inner rims of my eyelids.  It goes on smoothly and truly lasts all day.  I wear contacts and have had problems in the past with other eyeliners.  But not with this one.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner, have been using it for years and it is always my go to in my make-up bag.</li>
    <li> no smudging, glides on. Great price also, I&#x27;ve seen these go for over $20. I would totally recommend this product and supplier</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered Mally waterproof eyeliner pencil in the past and have been very pleased with its staying power. I need to sharpen it fairly often because I like the sharper point for lining my eyes. Have used it in several colors; all good.</li>
    <li> love love this eye pencil, have been using this product now for about 3 years.  Mally is right, it is bulletproof.... glides on, stays on all day, yet is easily removed at night.  Will never use another eye pencil again.  It lasts a long time.  I wear it everyday and use about 2 pencils a year... so good value as well.</li>
