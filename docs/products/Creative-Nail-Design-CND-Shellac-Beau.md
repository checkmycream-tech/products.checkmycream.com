<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this line of shellac nails.  This color is just the right combo of sheer and sparkle.  With two coats on, it&#x27;s a light pink sheer and has a fine glisten of sparkle in the light.  Very feminine and subtle.</li>
    <li> This is a very good brand of gel. I recently bought this whole line, my clients are very happy with the outcome of their nails!</li>
    <li> This stuff does exactly what it says it will!  I used steel wool to scrub out a pan recently and my nails still look perfect.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it is not the color I was expecting from the color of the bottle.  I would suggest looking for pictures on line of what the colors look like when applied because only one of the three colors I bought looks the way I expected it to look.  Other than that, this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> SHIPPING/ARRIVAL - This polish arrived quickly, was packaged well and appeared to be a new, unopened bottle.  COLOR - I ordered this color based on another&#x27;s review and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This color is NOT OPAQUE like it might appear based on the way the bottle looks, but a sheer clear with a very light pearlized lavender shimmer which is just what I was looking for.  I wanted something that would look good as a french manicure, while allowing my natural moons to show through and it does that.  Also, so many clear base coats turn a little yellow after a while.  This one does not do that.  LONGEVITY - This is my first time using the Shellac system and after 3 weeks or so I like it a lot.  However, I am still having a some lifting of the polish off the edges of my pointer and middle fingers on both hands after about 3 days. I have been using a different color on my pedicure and have not had any problems there. I think I am following all directions, but need to figure out the cause of this, whether it be my application method or just this color. Luckily, I have been able to cut the loose lifted polish off with tiny scissors and just refill in the edge with the base/color/topcoat which seems to do the trick with virtually no demarcation line. This technique may not work as well with a color that is not so sheer, but I guess I&#x27;ll find out later when my nails have gotten longer and I&#x27;m ready to go with an opaque shade.  NAIL RIDGES OR IMPERFECT NAILS - I found that this CND UV polish is able to self-level in ridgy nails and camouflage imperfections that my other non-UV polishes seemed to amplify. That makes my very happy. The polish when cured feels almost like a stretchy rubber covering on my nails. I notice that my nail edges do not catch or snag on anything anymore as they are now covered and protected. This feature alone will allow me to grow my nails more easily!</li>
    <li> This color is super light. It would be a great color for a french manicure. If you want just a slight tint to your natural color, than this is the polish for you. This is not a matte color pink. It is basically a clear color, with a hint of pink.</li>
    <li> This color is transparent, so I can still see the pink and white part of my nail through two coats.  My nails look shiny and very slightly pink - just a little pinker than clear.  Great if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, but I wanted an opaque pink and I had no way of knowing that this would be so see-through.</li>
    <li> This is my favourite colour for french manicures (paired with CND&#x27;s &#x27;Studio White&#x27;), as it is barely pink with a faint shimmer/sparkle. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it alone, and it gave my nails a slight pink look (didn&#x27;t really like it as much as when paired with white for a french).</li>
    <li> This is my second time using Shellac polish. This color would be the preferred one out of the two I have tried. It is exactly what I was looking for in a polish and color. It is a transparent light \\&quot;natural\\&quot; pink color with slight purple sparkles in direct light. For the very clean, manicured, natural nail look. It may also look nice with white tips. I used this Shellac polish (two coats) with the Gelish top and bottom coat. Stayed on like a charm.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional, and I bought this polish, the top and base coats, and UV lamp, and my nails are fabulous. I will probably never go back to regular polish again. This stuff may be a lot more expensive, but with as little as I use and how long it stays looking really fresh (over 2 weeks), it&#x27;s totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> The CND Shellac products are amazing! The Beau color coat is the perfect clear coat for a French manicure. It is a clear coat with a barely noticeable pink tint to it. It also has just the right amount of shimmer in the sunlight, but is not sparkly. This is exactly what I wanted for my French Mani. I will warn you that if you are looking for a solid light pink color this is not for you. The colors of the shellac bottles are a little misleading since they have to block out all UV light.&lt;br /&gt;I recenly bought the base and top coats, beau and studio white to do my French manicures at home. I also purchased a french manicure brush, 99% rubbing alcohol ( to remove the tackiness once you are finished- I could only find this online) and a UV curing light to properly \\&quot;dry\\&quot; the polish ( make sure to buy a 36 watt UV light or it will not cure properly- I bought the thermal spa brand and it works great).&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is curious, here&#x27;s how I now do my manicure:&lt;br /&gt;*prepare nails by cleaning up the cuticles and pushing them back; file nails to desired shape.  Make sure to do a dry manicure. Soaking them in water will interfere with the adherence of the shellac. Also, do not apply lotions or cuticle oil until the last step.&lt;br /&gt;*apply base coat and cure for 10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;*apply beau to entire nail and cure for 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;*apply studio white to tips of nails and use the manicure brush dipped in the rubbing alcohol to make the \\&quot;smile line\\&quot; then cure for 2 minutes. If you apply this correctly you will only have to do one layer of white.&lt;br /&gt;*apply top coat to entire nail and cure for 3 minutes. ( the CND instructions say to cure for 2 minutes, but I have found that 3 gives&lt;br /&gt; me longer lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;*use a paper towel dipped in the rubbing alcohol to remove the tacky layer on top by vigorously rubbing it on each nail. You&#x27;re done. You do not have to wait to touch anything, the manicure will not chip or smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some helpful hints:&lt;br /&gt;* shake each bottle at least a minute before using it&lt;br /&gt;* do each hand individually&lt;br /&gt;* do not cure until you have cleaned up the edges. If the polish is touching your skin, you need to wipe it off before curing or your Mani will peel after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;* apply polish in fairly thin layers, but not too thin. Let the brush barely glide over the nail; do not press the brush against the nail&lt;br /&gt;with too much pressure or you will create bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;* with each layer make sure to seal the nail by painting the edge as well. This is super important and will ensure you get 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;out of the manicure.&lt;br /&gt;* make sure your bulbs aren&#x27;t burnt out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* if your manicure doesn&#x27;t last 2 weeks, chances are you messed up one of these details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This takes a little bit of practice but is actually very easy to do at home. If you can paint your nails with regular polish then you can easily use this product. My initial investment was about $130 before shipping. It would cost me close to $100 per month to have this done at the salon, so this pays for itself after about the third or fourth use. This product may not be for everyone, but it is fantastic in my opinion. I am a nurse and am not allowed to wear acrylics or any nail polish that is chipped, so this is the perfect option for me!

    <li> This and Negligee are the only 2 transparent Shellac colors I&#x27;ve found and I love them both!  They are fantastic for a french manicure or alone for a very natural look.  Beau is slightly more pink and Negligee is a little more white.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light pink for french mani but this just a clear with a slight pink tint and no sparkle or shimmer. It doesn&#x27;t change the color of my natural nail at all. So, if you are looking for a &#x27;clear&#x27; or if your natural nail beds are white this color will b fine. However, if you want a &#x27;natural&#x27; pink that you can notice may I suggest Strawberry Smoothie!</li>
    <li> The CND Shellac system works great if you follow the instructions. I am very pleased with this purchase. Highly recommend! This color was a little more pink than I was looking for but that was my mistake, as I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of the color I really wanted. It is still a nice color though!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that there is a difference between shelac and gel but I guess there is. As far as color all the previous ratings were correct</li>
    <li> This is a nice sheer pink color. Négligée is my favorite but this is a close second.  CND products are awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a nice and light pink color, a little see-through (which is what I was looking for). Definitely a color for someone who wants a more natural-looking color that won&#x27;t stand out to much. Easy shellac &amp; uv light application with great wear and tear as compared to regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> This one is a very light pink, use it with cream puff for french manicure. Use it alone for an almost bare look.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect color if your are going with a french tip manicure. It&#x27;s not quite pink enough to be a french manicure, but not brown enough to be an American manicure. It&#x27;s a little of both worlds.</li>
    <li> This is a very soft pink, you can do two coats if you want it to be a bit pinker.  It is perfect for a french manicure, makes your nails look very healthy.  The shellac polish is very easy to use and wears well.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a sheer pink soak off gel and this comes the closest...it&#x27;s a sheer pink with a touch of bluish tint and some very slight sparkle...wish it showed a little more pink but by far the closest I have come to that perfect sheer pink!</li>
    <li> Great polish, great color.  Shipped in a timely manner.  Seems like the nail techs out there don&#x27;t do as good a job with my nails so I decided to do them myself.  This is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> This is a great color to have on hand - it&#x27;s complimentary to all skin tones, and it&#x27;s a great shade for a fast manicure - when you just don&#x27;t have time to be very careful applying a dark color!</li>
    <li> This is a great nude spring / summer color!  Sheer enough to use without painting nail tips white and still get the French manicure look with your natural white tips showing through.</li>
    <li> I love this color use it alone or you can use on top of another color to tone it down. I used tropix and use this to top or second coat looks like sherbet. Nice</li>
    <li> I love to get my nails done and this shellac color lets my natural nails show through.  Lasts a long time despite me doing yard work.  Highly recommend that you try this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and am very pleased with the results.  The first bottle lasted me over a year doing my nails every 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought a system including a [[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]] with CND base and top coats about six months ago.  Beau applies smooth and evenly.  Very sheer pink with the two recommended layers.  Great natural look and perfect for layering over darker shades to soften them a bit.  Lasted a full month without chipping.  Neutral enough the 3/8\\&quot; new growth at the cuticle wasn&#x27;t obvious at first glance.</li>
    <li> These polishes work great and this is one of my favorite colors for French Manicures.  It can be used alone as well.</li>
    <li> This color is perfect all by it&#x27;s self.  Lets your tips show thru for a really natural look with the tiniest hint of pink/blush tones with the tiniest bit of sparkle if you look at it in the light.  I love it.  Now I know that shellacs can be layered for lots of color combos and some of them that I have seen use Beau as the last top color- can&#x27;t wait to try it.  This is the color that would go with any skin tone I think.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural color.  I especially enjoy it in the summer months. You will not be disappointed with this color choice.</li>
    <li> Great sheer reflective and slightly shimmery color. Very natural and goes on thin. Perfect for French manicures. I&#x27;ve had great luck with CND products.</li>
    <li> The CND product line else where is pricey, but through Amazon it is a great price.  The polish is easy to remove (about 20 minutes). Most gel like products take a lot longer to remove and most do dry out your nails. The CND Shellac is the opposite on your nails. It wears very well for about 2 1/2 weeks (my nails are very short). The shine is good !!!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go back to regular polish again.  I love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I wanted a clear shellac with a hint of pink.  It Is just that, with a dash of very fine sparkle.  You only see that under bright light and it&#x27;s very subtle.  I read all the reviews about different colors and decided this was the one for me.  Just love it and I&#x27;m excited about trying some new colors as well.</li>
    <li> This is just the right shade of sheer pink. I just got it a couple of days ago and quickly used it. The only thing is I painted 1 layer of Romantique first, then 2 layers of Beau. My next attempt will be without Romantique at all. I believe Beau is more my style all on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CND Shellac is the BEST things for girlie girls! I always get compliments on my nails (even when they&#x27;re up to 2 weeks old!) While I recommend this for those of us that would normally go to the salon normally and don&#x27;t want to spend $50+ each time we need our nails painted...I would also recommend this to anyone who normally paints their nails at home anyways. While it takes a few extra minutes on the front end because of the curing time for each layer of polish, it saves you hours of drying time and the aggravation of messed up paint color from smudging it while still wet. But what is PRICELESS is the fact that it truly does NOT chip...ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop reading reviews! Just get it! &#x3D;)</li>
