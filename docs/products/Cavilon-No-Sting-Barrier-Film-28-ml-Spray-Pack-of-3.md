    <li> I got this product as a request from a friend. it is working perfect in his Dad. excellent product</li>
    <li> My husband has an ostomy and uses this and loves it!  He applies it as a barrier between his skin and the adhesive of the stoma apparatus.  This product helped rid him of all the open wounds and lesions he had developed.</li>
    <li> Very good for large skin areas.</li>
    <li> Did what was expected</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product when caring for an invalid who tends to develop small abrasions from something as simple as friction caused by a sheet.  Unlike other &amp;#34;liquid skin&amp;#34; products, one can lay on a protected film on a given area without causing the patient any pain.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have an adhesive allergy and have had an ileostomy. My wound care nurse had never had a patient with my allergy so we were not sure what products would or wouldn&#x27;t work for me. This is an amazing product and I would recommend it to anyone. I received a bottle from wound care, and a bottle from my in hospital nurses.  My supply company sells the wipes from this company, but not the bottle. The spray bottle is much easier to use than the wipes, especially when having to use a stomahesive protective powder for lesions. My local Walgreens sells their version of this, but ithe come in an aerosol can that sprays too much at a time, clogs up, and sometimes comes broken. In a sinch, you can put that in your Cavilon bottle while waiting for the real Cavilon to ship. Stick with Cavilon brand, it is far superior to others.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Good product for use with ostomies.</li>
    <li> It is the best on the market for my particular problem!</li>
    <li> Better value than local medical supply. Still expensive may try the wipes next order. No waste I hear.</li>
    <li> Works great on skin around ileostomies. Do not use too much, only a very thin layer creates a nice dry skin barrier.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a patient who was undergoing chemo and needed protection on the skin for sores.  It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> Really works great.  pray on and let dry, and your skin is sticky enough that the colostomy bag will adhere perfectly.  Two glued surfaces.</li>
    <li> I like this more than other brand similar products,my skin feel comfortable.I&#x27;ll be back in the future.</li>
    <li> works just as described</li>
    <li> Works great!!! No experience of using anything else though so can&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...before leaving the hospital they gave me 2 samples.  These samples lasted me for over 7 months, and my first few weeks had me changing the pouch quite often. While I am a senior ostomate with medicare...my medical supply company doesn&#x27;t carry this product.  The price through Amazon is good and the delivery time is great!</li>
    <li> Exactly the product I needed, reasonable price and delivery. Perfect.</li>
    <li> A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. WOUL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Great for some things&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for what I hoped but not the products fault.&lt;br /&gt;Was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Very sticky.  The lotion version is a little on the greasy side but this is stiicky.  Works for protecting the area needed.</li>
    <li> Worked as prescribed by wound nurse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many barrier films and this is by far the best. I just wish it came in bigger bottles!</li>
