      <li>Yes I love the products.</li>
      <li>It is more for food products.</li>
      <li>I got the 100ml bottle that had packing tape around the top.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this oil.  </li>
      <li>and I can eat it too!:)</li>
      <li>buying more A+++ seller</li>
      <li>Love it ....</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>OKAY I BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 5 YEARS.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of coconut oil.  </li>
      <li>It is also the best brand for applying on dry and chapped skin and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But my son insisted that I warm it up first.</li>
      <li>cover comes sealed to ensure that the oil is unadulterated.</li>
      <li>Great to take on a weekend trip but order a bigger size if you plan to use it often.</li>
      <li>, my scalp feels good and my hair feels alive again.  </li>
      <li>I smelled it after i shook it in liquid form, and wow, it smells good.</li>
      <li>I recommend this oil for damaged hair gives amazing shine and health back to hair :)</li>
      <li>It is great for dry damaged hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>Just right!</li>
      <li>** the picture of the bottle looks like the full size</li>
      <li>I think the title should mention this since I would have gone for a full size even with the ml displayed.</li>
      <li>I guess i really did not pay attetion to the how many ml, but the should show the extact size</li>
      <li>I also mixed it with coconut conditioner ($1 kind) and refrigerated can of natural coconut milk--to get it more whipped(dollar store brand) to get an even better effect.</li>
      <li>However, I do think it may not be enough if used alone for this size bottle--best to get creative with it. :)</li>
      <li>Does magic to your hair makes it so soft to manage</li>
      <li>, I bought this to use in my hair, it makes it very soft, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant at all</li>
      <li>Came quick bottle was pretty small but smells great and leaves the hair</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly, but definitely smells of coconut, and leaves a bit of a lingering fragrance on my clothes that is very nice but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Remember, 100 mL isn&#x27;t very much, so don&#x27;t be misled by the picture.</li>
      <li>Being unemployed at the moment, and given the economy, this size bottle is very reasonable for the price.</li>
      <li>Also, I let it float in hot water for a bit to get it watery</li>
      <li>Thanks seller!</li>
      <li>It did smell like used bacon grease at first, I almost just tossed it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this oil smells really like a coconut idk if I would buy it again because for the size of it I&#x27;m not really liking, but you pay for what you get, but I probably will buy it again because it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like my homemade coconut oil that I always extract from the freshes coconut in the food market.</li>
      <li>I have used it for healthy strong strands but usually buy from the Indian Market.</li>
      <li>I took his advise and ran it under hot water where it went liquid fast.</li>
      <li>It is great to add a dab or two to a cassia or henna mix with other oils etc will really make this bottle last!</li>
      <li>I used it with pure cassia obovata powder (zenia,only $5) and camomile tea to help bring moisture and shine to my hair.</li>
      <li>The bottle was a mini travel size and I was expecting a large bottle.</li>
      <li>This product works very well and it made my hair super soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>I can tell this is the real deal for pure 100% coconut oil.</li>
      <li>But, the body that they advertised is very deceiving to customers.</li>
      <li>Works very well</li>
      <li>REALLY?</li>
      <li>and they are now smooth, instantly.</li>
      <li>Using it will see how well it is really.</li>
      <li>My next purchase would be definitely a bigger bottle to last me a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>first of all the coconut would not come out the bottle and second i did&#x27;nt</li>
      <li>Too early to tell about the oil and how it works, so far used it on my hair and skin.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>It does make your hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Once this seal is broken, and once the top cover is opened, it closes in a neat snap-in manner to keep the oil from getting oxidized.</li>

<li> Carrying too big a pack during your travels might result in the oil becoming stale because it is not used up</li>
<li> I was a little surprised by how small the bottle is, because I did not remember how big a milliliter was relative to an ounce (sadly, I don&#x27;t remember my metric very well), but that quickly turned out not to be a problem.</li>
<li> It spreads very well from very small amounts, and even with daily application, this little bottle lasted me for several weeks.</li>
<li> I put it in my hair when it is dry</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my natural thick hair nor it relieved the itch from my scalp.</li>
<li> /&gt;The 100 ml pack is and extremely convenient size, neither too big nor too small.</li>
<li> It was such a small bottle</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small 100ml was, only 3.22oz misleading just a little  by posting 100ml.</li>
<li> IT IS NOT A FULL SIZE.</li>
<li> Not sure if that was on my end or if that was deceiving product display.</li>
<li> The bottle is small.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be.</li>
<li> USUALLY BUY IT AT THE STORE $4</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to get out.</li>
<li> This is travel size and is not worth the $5 unless you want to have an expensive travel bottle.</li>
<li> This product is very very small.</li>
<li> Has a weird smell</li>
<li> Was very disappointed when I received it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very fast shipping and the best coconut oil!</li>
    <li> This bottle is the size of a travel size lotion. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> It did smell like used bacon grease at first, I almost just tossed it. But my son insisted that I warm it up first. I took his advise and ran it under hot water where it went liquid fast. His lips were chapped so I gave him some and they are now smooth, instantly. I smelled it after i shook it in liquid form, and wow, it smells good. Nice and sweet like coconuts! I got the 100ml bottle that had packing tape around the top. There is no bar code but on the side it is printed \\&quot;Not To Be Sold Separately\\&quot; and \\&quot;Extra with 500ml\\&quot; so it looks like this is one of those extra samples you get when you do buy the bigger bottle. Good value for the price. Thanks seller!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my natural thick hair nor it relieved the itch from my scalp.</li>
    <li> love oils so its a great purchase online for hair and body buy in bulk I bought just to try it out now I need more lol so just buy n bulk.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and it made my hair super soft and silky.  I had to heat it up in the microwave to make it runny because it is a solid but with heat will turn to a oil.</li>
    <li> pay attention that the bottle is tiny</li>
    <li> This is definitely not for your hair!!! It is more for food products. Was very disappointed when I received it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil.  I massaged it into my scalp and hair and OMG, my scalp feels good and my hair feels alive again.  I am going to purchase a larger bottle especially since I didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the size of this bottle when I placed my order(this is a travel size bottle).  I will use this exclusively as my hair moisturizer.  What a treat and it smells wonderful too!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The bottle was a mini travel size and I was expecting a large bottle. Not sure if that was on my end or if that was deceiving product display. The actual oil works well though.</li>
    <li> This is AN AMAZING product for hair and skin. I have used it for healthy strong strands but usually buy from the Indian Market. ***Warning*** the picture of the bottle looks like the full size IT IS NOT A FULL SIZE. This is travel size and is not worth the $5 unless you want to have an expensive travel bottle. I think the title should mention this since I would have gone for a full size even with the ml displayed.</li>
    <li> Remember, 100 mL isn&#x27;t very much, so don&#x27;t be misled by the picture. The bottle is small. Like all coconut oil, when cold (and even room temperature, the oil solidifies, so put the bottle in warm water to melt the oil, otherwise you won&#x27;t be getting any out of the bottle. I love coconut oil for cooking, for hair treatments, for my hands, and for the smell! Definitely a product you can use for a million things</li>
    <li> Like it a lot, not oily or greasy!! Just right!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small 100ml was, only 3.22oz misleading just a little  by posting 100ml. And the picture don&#x27;t help but the product is great. Now I have a pocket size to travel with. So still a win win.</li>
    <li> I have been using Parachute Pure Coconut Oil for more than three decades, and affirm that it is the best brand of coconut oil that is available for use as hair-oil in India. It is also the best brand for applying on dry and chapped skin and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parachute sources best quality coconuts for producing its Coconut Oil. The production, purification, and packing  add to the quality and preservation of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100 ml pack is and extremely convenient size, neither too big nor too small. Carrying too big a pack during your travels might result in the oil becoming stale because it is not used up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover comes sealed to ensure that the oil is unadulterated. Once this seal is broken, and once the top cover is opened, it closes in a neat snap-in manner to keep the oil from getting oxidized. It also prevents leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product it works wonder for my son eczema!!!</li>
    <li> In very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Works very well, I bought this to use in my hair, it makes it very soft, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant at all</li>
    <li> first of all the coconut would not come out the bottle and second i did&#x27;nt like the smell or bottle it was in. It was such a small bottle i just felt like i was cheated. i will never buy this product ever in life.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my keratosis pilaris after reading that coconut oil is the best thing for it, and I have to say, it does the job nicely. It doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly, but definitely smells of coconut, and leaves a bit of a lingering fragrance on my clothes that is very nice but not overwhelming. I was a little surprised by how small the bottle is, because I did not remember how big a milliliter was relative to an ounce (sadly, I don&#x27;t remember my metric very well), but that quickly turned out not to be a problem. It spreads very well from very small amounts, and even with daily application, this little bottle lasted me for several weeks. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Yes I love the products. I love the smell of coconut oil.  It does make your hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> For a while now I wanted to try this oil by parachute and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try. I can tell this is the real deal for pure 100% coconut oil. It smells exactly like my homemade coconut oil that I always extract from the freshes coconut in the food market. I use to think that the oil wasn&#x27;t suppose to smell like it&#x27;s been roasted of some sort (the homemade way you have to fry the coconut milk in a skillet or silver pot until the oil separates from the water). Now I don&#x27;t have to spend about three hours to extract the oil from the coconut it self. My next purchase would be definitely a bigger bottle to last me a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> Love it ....I put it in my hair when it is dry and I can eat it too!:) Great product!</li>
    <li> Too early to tell about the oil and how it works, so far used it on my hair and skin. But, the body that they advertised is very deceiving to customers. I guess i really did not pay attetion to the how many ml, but the should show the extact size</li>
    <li> REALLY? OKAY I BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 5 YEARS. USUALLY BUY IT AT THE STORE $4 LAST ME LIKE 12 USES. I ORDERED FROM THIS SELLER AND THEY SENT ME ONE THE SIZE OF MY FREAKIN PINKY LIKE ARE U KIDDING ME?? I ORDERED 2 BOTTLES FOR 9 BUCKS AND IT WILL ONLY LAST ME TWO USES. I AM NOTTTT RXAGGERATING THE BOTTLE IS THE SIZE OF MY PINKYYYYY!!!!</li>
    <li> Does magic to your hair makes it so soft to manage</li>
    <li> Came quick bottle was pretty small but smells great and leaves the hair beautiful xoxox buying more A+++ seller I recommend this oil for damaged hair gives amazing shine and health back to hair :)</li>
    <li> Has a weird smell but I like how it makes my hair feels. It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Greasy! It does not feel like coconut oil and it smells synthetic. I think I threw it out, if I find it, I will.</li>
    <li> Best coconut oil! I cant wait to place another order.</li>
    <li> Being unemployed at the moment, and given the economy, this size bottle is very reasonable for the price. It is great for dry damaged hair and scalp. I used it with pure cassia obovata powder (zenia,only $5) and camomile tea to help bring moisture and shine to my hair. I also mixed it with coconut conditioner ($1 kind) and refrigerated can of natural coconut milk--to get it more whipped(dollar store brand) to get an even better effect. After putting it on I wrapped my head in plastic wrap and sat for an hour for extra moisture like a deep conditioning. It is great to add a dab or two to a cassia or henna mix with other oils etc will really make this bottle last! Also, I let it float in hot water for a bit to get it watery (you can check it by squeezing the sides in moderation to see if its still solid). I decided to use it because I saw someone on youtube use it in a cassia/henna mix and had great results as well. However, I do think it may not be enough if used alone for this size bottle--best to get creative with it. :)</li>
    <li> Not as good as I wished.But it will do for now. Using it will see how well it is really.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil smells really like a coconut idk if I would buy it again because for the size of it I&#x27;m not really liking, but you pay for what you get, but I probably will buy it again because it&#x27;s cheap it came in about a week</li>
    <li> Best oil i&#x27;ve used for my hair</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like the smell and it&#x27;s hard to get out.</li>
    <li> This product is very very small. It is travel size. I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be. Great to take on a weekend trip but order a bigger size if you plan to use it often.</li>
