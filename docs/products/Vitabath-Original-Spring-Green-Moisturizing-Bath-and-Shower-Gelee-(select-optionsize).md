<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> We spend 6 months every year (now that we finally retired) at our vacation home in the South of France......I know, \\&quot;what a life\\&quot; you must be thinking to yourself. I couldn&#x27;t agree more. While my husband and I worked our butts off for 45 years, a 2nd home in France was always our dream, our goal, our raison d&#x27;etre. We realized our dream in 2000. But enough about us, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friend&#x27;s in France is absolutely HOOKED on Vitabath. She&#x27;s a MAJOR bathtub-soaker person - wouldn&#x27;t THINK of taking a shower, non, non! Ever since she discovered Vitabath here in the States, years ago, you&#x27;d think it was caviar on toast with a flute of champagne. She&#x27;s crazy about it. Because she can&#x27;t buy it over there, I bring her a great big new bottle of the stuff every year when we go back to France for our Spring / Summer / Autumn stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my story, and I&#x27;m stickin&#x27; to it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body wash - it smells so fresh.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere except online - so glad I finally found it again!</li>
    <li> Nice, clean smelling bath products.  They are a staple in our house.</li>
    <li> Wonderful bath experience.  Refreshing and delightful.  Feels good on the skin.  Not drying especially since I am a Senior.  Leaves a wonderful aroma in the bath room as well as on your skin.  Can us sparingly and produces wonderful lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not loose its feel throughout the Bath.  The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming as often scented soaps/gelees are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found it.  Thanks Amazon for your choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernardine</li>
    <li> . . .When we use this emerald &#x27;goo&#x27;(gel) . .  it always gave us the feeling, - that we actually love our physical-body, and - it gave us the idea , that we are indeed i m p o r t a n t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the weight in emerald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY, - ENJOY, - ENJOY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(... we have nothing to do with the producers of this product. (For sure)</li>
    <li> Sometimes the tried and true is the best. I first used Vitabath Gelee, Original Spring Green when I was in college and nothing I have used since that time has remotely come close. This is the best shower wash, bar none!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally a European concept, Vitabath was an exotic indulgance back in the &#x27;60&#x27;s when it was first introduced in the US. Americans who had traveled to Europe had experienced Badedas, a German made, bright blue shower and bath gel that contained horse chestnut extract and smelled like a Happening in a pine forrest. [[ASIN:B000KVJMVW Badedas Rich Bath Gelee Original]]  Back in the &#x27;60&#x27;s most Americans considered Dove soap to be an ultimate indulgance. Paying good bucks for a \\&quot;shower gelee\\&quot; seemed a bit over the top and quite sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Vitabath Gelee became available in the US, those familiar with Badedas jumped to it. Many have copied it. I guess you can say it was the first soft soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, it&#x27;s much, much more! Men and women love it and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bright green gel that when mixed with water, lathers into great luxurious clouds of bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is unisex and absolutely devine! If you are put off by the pine association....relax! This is nothing like Pinesol. It&#x27;s totally yummy, delish. Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a Norwegian wooden sauna.....soft patchouli, rosewood and floral pine. A fragrance that manages to be energetic and relaxing, senusous and bracing, masculine and feminine. A perfect combination of Yin and Yang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel contains Vitamins A, D &amp; E and botanical extracts such as horse chestnut and sunflower oils and lanolin to soothe and condition the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans quickly and rinses easily. The skin is left soft and glowing and lightly moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitabath makes several versions, some more moisturizing than others. [[ASIN:B000052Z9F Vitabath Moisturizing Bath &amp; Shower Gelee, Plus For Dry Skin, 32-Ounces]] Spring Green is the original and is not as deeply moisturizing as some would like. I have dry skin and I find Spring Green to be wonderful.....but it must be rinsed off the body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend who used Spring Green for a bubble bath (it makes a great bubble bath!) but neglected to rinse the soap from her body after bathing. She was quite unhappy with the product because she found it drying....and it will be if left on the skin. If you only take baths and you don&#x27;t like to rinse after, this is not a product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favortie uses for Vitabath Gel is to use it for shaving. Its a perfect shaving gel that smells great, washes clean and provides a smooth, slippery surface for the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product that has been highly recommended and I have tried is the Olay Body Wash Ribbons (various versions) with glucosamine. [[ASIN:B001F51TS6 Olay Ribbons Body Wash plus Body Butter Ribbons, 18-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]] Its good. It&#x27;s much less expensive. It&#x27;s just not Vitabath!

Vitabath Bath &amp; Shower Gelee Spring Green is totally, absolutely great! Its well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is it.  The first bath gelee in the original scent.  For a blissful feeling of CLEAN, the refreshing scent of pine cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;A shower or bath, with Vitabath Original Spring Green leaves one clean, moisturized and renewed.  I love the generous bubbles for washing off true grime following a session of gardening, and the feeling of cool even on a hot, summer day!  I buy it in as large a container as I can, and keep it in the shower year &#x27;round.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for Vitabath, I was looking forward to trying something moisturizing.  I thought this contained Vitamin D but it seems to have been reformulated from what was described online.  Anyway, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product but I didn&#x27;t even try it after smelling it.  I didn&#x27;t think it was very \\&quot;green\\&quot; to try to return it so I will give it to someone else to try.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to strong scents, this may not be for you.  The shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitabath for about 35 years now, and still love it.  I&#x27;ve tried other bath gels, and keep coming back to Vitabath. I don&#x27;t travel without a small travel size. It makes my skin feel so clean and moist after a shower.  And smells GREAT. I am a fan of Original Spring Green.</li>
    <li> quality expected and arrived fine</li>
    <li> Various family members have used these products for years, and they&#x27;ve never disappointed.  They will forever be a favorite, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to give them as gifts.</li>
    <li> We just love the scent of this product and always have one on hand.  Of course it cleans well but most important it lhas a nice aroma when you get in bed.</li>
    <li> I swoon at the scent. Best bubblebath ever!!</li>
    <li> My aunt always had this in her shower many many years ago and I always loved the scent and the way it made made my skin feel and it has not changed in all these years, it will be a staple in my shower for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with Vitabath. I&#x27;ve used this product for 30 years, will use it till I die and will now order from Amazon.com. Thank you</li>
    <li> A fresh clean smell....my favorite for years.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much I named my first born vitabath</li>
    <li> Love love love my vitabath.</li>
    <li> I remember buying this from costco so many years back and I&#x27;ve been searching for this again! Glad to have found it! It has a nice green citrus smell. Whenever a family member uses this, you know right away because the bathroom smells sooo good!</li>
    <li> A little does a lot!  What a value</li>
    <li> Reward Time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lovely way to end the day after a long day &#x27;s work.  I am so happy to find this product again.</li>
    <li> Having purchased Vitabath Gelee for many years, from several suppliers, I expect it to be a thick, concentrated gel.  What I received in this order is a thin, watery, diluted product -- very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love this product but I wish it was cheaper!! Smells Great!  I had a couple bottles delivered where it had leaked all over my package. They sent me a new one to replace. Good product.</li>
    <li> My grandmother has been using this for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;m not partial to the fruity, flowery, etc. shower gels that smell mostly of chemicals. This has such a deep, earthy, almost woodsy fresh smell that&#x27;s so comforting. My boyfriend loved it so much he buys it now. It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than in stores and the 32-oz. bottle lasts me forever. I&#x27;ll keep buying if they keep selling!</li>
    <li> I adore this shower gel. I ADORE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super-sensitive skin, so I tend to have to use fragrance-free products for my skin--Aveeno, Aquaphor, Cetaphil. This, however, is one fragranced gel I can use and NOT itch or get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that it cleans so well without stripping the skin unduly. It leaves you feeling miraculously fresh and the scent is this perfect green-herbally smell (reminiscent of the original green scent of Herbal Essence shampoo back in the seventies, which was my fave shampoo scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the pump is a good one. Even on the big bottle, it doesn&#x27;t clog up or malfunction. At least, I&#x27;ve never had one go bad on me, unlike some other pump bottles for hygiene/shower products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s a tad pricey (but worth it for the quality), I use this not everyday, but on my workout days--that is, right before going to Pilates, I shower with this, because it totally keeps me smelling nice without perfumes (verboten at the studio) and I don&#x27;t get stinky, even after an hour of sweating it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gorgeous product. And at this sale price, I&#x27;m psyched! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(They also make a \\&quot;sugar scrub\\&quot; in this scent that is wonderful for a very light, non-irritating scrub of the feet and elbows.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I shower with it every day.  Will definitely buy it again.  Wish I had found it a long time ago..</li>
    <li> Awesome invigorating scent.</li>
    <li> I have used Vitabath in the past so I know what it is supposed to smell like.  This bottle seems rancid.  I used a few times thinking it was just me, but the more I use it the worse it smells.  Don&#x27;t  think it is right to return after I used a few times, but I feel really ripped off that I am out that much money and know I have to throw the rest away because it  is just gross.</li>
    <li> I love this product normally, it is a wonderful product.  HOWEVER, this particular bottle that was sent to me must have been very old.  The contents no longer smelled like that fabulous scent I love to pay so much money for.  The product went bad and it smells horrible, no scent of evergreens at all, just a yellowy-ish gel that stains your body and smells putrid.  What a huge disappointment.  I opened the product just recently and it&#x27;s outside of the window to return the product apparently.  I wasted my money, first huge disappointment from Amazon prime.m</li>
    <li> If given a choice, I would always buy Vitabath. It smells wonderful, moisturizes without being oily, and makes my skin feel silky. It&#x27;s great with a loofah or as a bubble bath. I just wouldn&#x27;t wash my face with it... maybe a bit too rich for that. The only complaint I have is it&#x27;s pretty spendy... but I guess you get what you pay for in this case. So if it doesn&#x27;t kill your budget, buy it and feel how great your skin feels even in the coldest, driest weather... or if you want to go out in the Summer and have your skin look silky and not overly shiny.</li>
    <li> The best.  I have been using this for years.  Before using this product I had skin reactions to most soaps.  Since using this I have not had any issues with my skin.  It lathers beautifully and rinses off cleanly, and I really like the smell.  It smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; to me.</li>
    <li> Have been  using this since the late 1960&#x27;s.  Love the refreshing feeling after using the gel in the shower and it does not dry your skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this bath gel since I was in college decades ago. i love the fresh, clean scent and the bubbles. It is still my favorite after collecting a whole shelf full of gels</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite scent in Vitabath which I&#x27;ve used  for years but it does have a clean, fresh scent which is a change from time to time. My favorite is the Plus For Dry Skin scent.</li>
    <li> Great product.  For an old guy it makes my skin feel great and smell great.  Great smell and easy to pump.</li>
    <li> Vitabath is very good on my skin when I shower.  It is getting harder to find it in my local stores.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this.  Comes in several scents, all of which are great.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of fresh evergreens buy this gel. Not only does it smell wonderful, it leaves your skin soft and fragment.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - fresh, clean scent and feels good.</li>
    <li> This arrived today 8/21/2014 and it was the correct emerald green and had the rich scent I know and love. I could smell it before I even opened the box! The bottle came from Lot #415051.</li>
    <li> When they took this product out of the Drug Stores and the upscale Dept.Store I was very upset.I really love the clean&lt;br /&gt;fragrance of this shower gel.I was pleased to fine it again.I get so many comments from people how good I smell.Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not much to say - it&#x27;s the classic Vitabath \\&quot;Spring Green\\&quot; scent which was based off the German bubble bath, Badedas.  Vitabath is a great product and if I cannot find or purchase a reliable source of Badedas, this is my shower gel of choice.  It smells wonderful, washes off clean, and is better for the skin than any mass-produced American product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Seen this size sold for much more in stores, so was a good buy. This smell is so refreshing and smart. The product in Europe is Beddess, or something like that, and is hard to find.</li>
    <li> quite happy with this classic for my daughter-in-law. it&#x27;s such a great product and the purchase of it through amazon made gifting easy.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering again, as soon as I finish what I have.  Thank you.  Hope I can continue to find this product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> love this product have been using for 30 years.</li>
    <li> I rate this product a 5. Makes a great gift for your special someone.I have use the bath &amp; shower for years.</li>
    <li> My grandmother used to use this product and she would give me this shower gel at times. I love the scent and the lather it produces. A great product and a great price!!</li>
    <li> The Shower Gelee was very good indeed</li>
    <li> A favorite bath product from the 1980-1990s but unable to locate in stores (in Los Angeles) for more than a decade. A GREAT body cleanser with a refreshing, lively scent that leaves me feeling good and ready to begin my day.  A downright must-have product if you enjoy a wake-me-up, but relaxing, silky feeling kind-of-shower. I generally need only a one-pump measure of Vitabath on my shower pouf to cleanse from neck to toes; very concentrated. The pine-like scent is heavenly! I am glad to make my re-aquaintance with Vitabath on Amazon.com. Try it for yourself! Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Product is great, however, I ordered two items which was to result in a discount. Second item was cancelled by the merchant because it was not in stock after the order was placed, and I was charged full price.  Could have ordered it from another merchant but chose this one because I use this product and could appreciate the discount. No shipping order enclosed with the shipment either.</li>
    <li> I love vitabath and the smell takes me back to younger times.&lt;br /&gt;We live at high altitude (5400 ft) and when the boxes arrived, the soap had leaked out. I smelled this as soon as I picked up the package.&lt;br /&gt;I wish Vitabath made a lotion.</li>
    <li> Best shower gel you can buy.  Scent is strong and last throughout the whole bottle.  No soap residue in the tub.  You can count on a refreshing shower everyday..</li>
    <li> I love Vitabath. It smells absolutely amazing! This was a huge, generously sized bottle. I saved quite a bit vs purchasing from Ulta.</li>
    <li> For awhile I couldn&#x27;t find the item. Then by accident I was delighted to find it on Amazon. This bath and shower gelee smells like you are in a wonderful forest. I have been using this product for many years. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else for bath. Fresh, woodsy scent, never dries out skin and takes a very small amount to lather up.  Wish they would sell a candle and room spray in this scent. Just be sure to choose &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; Spring Green, they sometimes have sold a new green scent.</li>
    <li> NOTHING is as GREAT as Vitabath!! Green has wonderful fresh scent, and you cannot beat it for skin-softening bubbles!</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of Vitabath, and I can assure you this is not the real product. The color is wrong, the smell is way off, and the viscosity of the gel is off too. I am perplexed that Amazon is selling a fake product through Prime. Huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> Makes you smell like an evergreen forest.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 40 years...excellent!  Love the scent and how it makes my skin feel.  Pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this item during a stay at the wonderful Vier Jahreszeiten Hotel in Hamburg, Germany a few years ago. I never forgot the fine lathering quality and bracing &#x27;green&#x27; fragrance that Vitabath offers.  Fortunately, I can buy this at Amazon with just a few key strokes...which saves me a bundle on plane and hotel $$$!  I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> greatest bath gel ever.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;ve changed the formula. It smells different.  It feels different. I&#x27;ve used Vitabath since 1970. I dropped this one in the trash and will look for something else, Very sad and disappointed.</li>
    <li> This has a fresh smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering and seems to help with skin that tends to be on the dry side.</li>
    <li> These products, both the shower gelee and the moisturizing lotion, are absolutely fabulous!  Great fragrance and makes you, and  your bathroom and other rooms, smell so fresh and clean after you shower using the gelee and apply the lotion.  I have used the shower gelee for years and never get tired of it.  I always request it for birthdays, etc.  Tried the lotion this time and really like it, too.  Great products!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just magnificent for my skin, it has a divine aroma!  What else could one want. Although its pricy it lasts a long time! I use it in the shower as I don&#x27;t take baths, but it works so well.  I think anyone would love it!</li>
    <li> Makes me feel so clean and refreshed! Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive as its a real treat I give myself in between other body washes</li>
    <li> I used this product on my granddaughter when she was a very young child.  She is now 26 yrs. old and would continue to use it herself if given to her as a gift-she cannot afford to buy it for herself.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is distinctive and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Love it love love it makes me feel great!  Thick, just a little goes a long way.  Try it you will like it.</li>
