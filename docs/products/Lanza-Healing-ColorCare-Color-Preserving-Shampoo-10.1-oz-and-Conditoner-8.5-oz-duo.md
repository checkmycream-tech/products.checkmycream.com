<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for over a year now and think it is a great product. It keeps my hair conditioned and doesn&#x27;t bleed it of color, so I color it less frequently.</li>
    <li> Love this product it&#x27;s wonderfully.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says, it truly preserves the color. I wear lowlights and highlights combined and I have them done every 3 to 4 months. Well, by washing my hair with this combo, the colors of both remain the same tones until the next time I need to have them done again. I am happy because I used to have issues with my color fading away after less than a month of having my hair done. It was quite upsetting until I found this shampoo and conditioner and they both have worked for me pretty good.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I will never switch!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair now has the body which was missing from all the other so called great shampoo&#x27;s. Not only does it have body, my fine hair now is actually thicker, shines and I can use less product.</li>
    <li> Great product! It leaves my hair soft and manageable. Unlike many other products my hair remains soft even after blow drying and ironing. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;D.Cenga.</li>
    <li> These were  gifts for my daughter...it&#x27;s the only hair cleansing product she uses</li>
    <li> good for hair that&#x27;s colored..</li>
    <li> Good product for straight low maintenance hair. Shipping time, amazing</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and she would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for over 5 years.  The beauty shop no longer stocks this product; so, I am very pleased that I can find it online.  I believe it does preserve my hair color.  And, it seems very gentle too.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair and this has been by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have tried. My hair doesn&#x27;t get dried out and I am able to go more than 1 day between washes which I have never been able to do previously.</li>
    <li> Had these products before. Very good</li>
    <li> I love the smell and performance!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner. My hair salon sells them for $24.00 each! I was paying about 50 dollars for these small bottles, but the price on here is amazing. Thank you soooo much</li>
    <li> So I ordered the shampoo and conditioner combo. When I got the product I got vitamins! YES, PILLS! When I tired to return it the buyer would not allow a return or exchange! So I had to call amazon and get it all sorted out. I was not happy!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!  My hair is soft and my color stays gorgeous!  I recommend this to anyone looking for an amazing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Very good products that help retain the color in the hair.</li>
    <li> No other products are gentle enough on my hair without over conditioning. Also, one of the only product lines out there with UVB protection in addtion to theothers...</li>
    <li> Great value.  Very pleased.  Prompt delivery.  Well packaged.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes my fine hair so soft and light. So glad I purchased this shampoo for this great deal!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I have super dry hair.  These appear to work about the same as anything else I could buy.  Had they worked better than I would have given five stars.  Just be aware that while they aren&#x27;t bad, they really aren&#x27;t that great either.  They get the job done...barely.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST product on the market.  I have spent a lot of money over many years buying every product at the various hair salons and nothing compares to L&#x27;Anza. Over the years I have permed my hair and colored it.  It is naturally thin and it was damaged, badly. I tried it all and then finally a new hair dresser I went too after I moved sweared by L&#x27;Anza so I figured why not, I&#x27;ve tried everything else.  Within a few weeks my hair was no longer brittle and dry looking.  Felt soft, looked fuller, and I noticed I didn&#x27;t have to color my as often as I have in the past because of the protection it gives to color treated hair.  It&#x27;s truly Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this! I use this on my hair now, and love how it makes my hair feel.  It&#x27;s nice and soft after use.  Would recommend to anyone else looking for new hair care products.</li>
    <li> This product keeps color and healthiness in your hair.I would highly recommend to all my friends and family. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have used Lanza Healing Color and the Healing Moisture line for years. I have tried other product lines but always come back to Lanza.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, color treated hair.  The shampoo does a great job of washing without stripping my hair.  I have blonde hair so fading isn&#x27;t as much of an issue as with other deeper colors.  Conditioner does a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and responds differently to products.  This line is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Good afternoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder where the product is bought. To date not reached the destination, although it appears as delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magali Scherer</li>
    <li> Great product! Have used before. Cleans thoroughly; smells great; easy on your hair; extends the life of your hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5455wherry</li>
    <li> I color my hair red and with the summer (sun, pool, ocean, etc.) my color usually fades quickly, but not with the L&#x27;Anza product! I love the shampoo.. it lathers but not too much and a little goes a long way. I do not wash rinse, lather and repeat. I just wash it once and this does the trick. I like the conditioner but I like the shampoo better. The price is better on Amazon than in my salon. I also use the L&#x27;Anza treatment as well and that has definitely helped with breakage, etc. The smell is wonderful too.</li>
    <li> Great deal and I love these products.</li>
    <li> For the first 3 weeks I felt like this was the best shampoo &amp; conditioner on the planet but after the 3rd week of use it started to leave my hair feeling dry. By week 5 I stopped using it completely because it made my hair feel dry as straw.</li>
    <li> The Conditioner is not authentic.&lt;br /&gt;It smell bad!&lt;br /&gt;I sent company an email and never heard back- and they doubled my shipping cost!!&lt;br /&gt;Not happy!</li>
    <li> excellent - thank you.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy after my hairdresser uses it at her salon.  Leaves my hair soft, manageable and beautiful.</li>
    <li> By far the BEST shampoo out there!  Lanza products are number one - from shampoo to all of the other products they produce, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser originally suggest this product for my color treated hair.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I have never used another shampoo that protected and lengthened the life of the color as much as L&#x27;Anza.  I won&#x27;t use any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hair products! All of them :)</li>
    <li> Great product good buy</li>
    <li> These products are making my hair soft, silky and shiny.  Will definitely buy again.  The best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are pricey, but worth the extra money.  I have color-treated, naturally curly hair that tends to be a little dry.  This product maintains hair color and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> Smells floral.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t seem to maintain my color (bright pink) more than any other shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner is not hydrating enough for my bleached and colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> First time using this seller and am very pleased. Items arrived VERY fast and packed well! Great prices and would definitely use again!!!&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Anza works exactly as promised. Color stays bright and hair feels like it&#x27;s never been damaged. Doesn&#x27;t take much shampoo or conditioner, rinses out well and leaves hair shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!!</li>
    <li> In the past I have had a hard time maintaining the highlights I get put in my hair.  They always fade and turn orange.  With this product my highlights stayed true and my hair is soft and manageable.  The only down side with the conditioner is how thick it is and not getting the last bit out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair dresser and I just love these products.  I have short hair so I need only use a very small amount to get lather and cleaning, so it lasts a long time.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair too soft and unmanageable.  Actually, I have dried my hair without applying styling gel and could still create a nice style.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 1 year.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My hair is very clean feeling and smooth.  It is also very managable. I French braid my hair and this makes my hair easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy/curly, natural brown hair and I color it auburn. Red is tricky to begin with, so I needed a shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t strip the color out and make it dull. This shampoo has a great, sweet smell without being nauseating, lathers great and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and my hair is as vibrant as it was when I first dyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, so I&#x27;m not sure if you do, it&#x27;ll lose the color over too many washes.</li>
    <li> Great hair product for colored hair.Leaves my hair very smooth and easy to control.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. I have a keratin treatment and the hairdresser recommended this. Its sulfate free. Works great and my hair is in great condition. Much better value on amazon than anywhere else. Its expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Roland product and seller</li>
    <li> Love this product, but when it arrived some of the shampoo had leaked out of the container making a mess. Hopefully that will be corrected.  I subtracted a star for the shipping mess.</li>
    <li> So my stylist used a different version of this brand on my hair during the last visit and I LOOOOVED the way it made my hair move.  He suggested I try this specific line to help protect against the abuse I put my hair through (lots of outdoor time).  I have been using for about two weeks and I am not in love.  It does not reduce the frizz like my last brand and while it might help with fading, I am not seeing a remarkable difference.  The shampoo is better than the conditioner, but for me, conditioner is key to the health of my hair.  I need something that will condition, but not weigh me down.  I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> While this shampoo smells nice, it absolutely stripped the color from my hair and left it feeling very dry!</li>
    <li> I was concerned I wouldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; buying L&#x27;Anza online, but it was fine and cheaper than I could buy it myself in the beauty supply store.  Great shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair!</li>
    <li> Great product and shippping</li>
    <li> seeems very thick and difficult to wash out.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I usually buy it evertime at get my hair done.  Fortunately I found a better deal through Amazon.  I just wish they had the bigger bottles available.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice lather &amp; it&#x27;s very easy to comb hair after washing-even if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner. The downside to that is I can&#x27;t skip a day of washing my hair. The next morning it is greasy feeling. I will continue to use to see if it makes my color last longer. Overall, I do like the shampoo &amp; conditioner,but if you have fine hair,you might need to wash daily.</li>
    <li> great price, good product</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy, dry hair that I color regularly.  This shampoo and conditioner made my hair look and feel amazing!  I also use Pureology products.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this line and I really like it.  I live in a dry climate and blow dry and iron or curl my hair regularly.  I have really coarse hair (because much of it is gray now) and while my original hair was straight, my gray hair is very unruly and wavy.  My hair tends to be dry both due to the climate in which I live and my use of heat styling appliances.  This shampoo and conditioner works really well and my color does not fade and the conditioner works well without being heavy.  You don&#x27;t get any waxy residue in your hair, just nice and clean and soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Helps frizzies hair soft.</li>
    <li> Loved it but ran out way too soon.  :)</li>
    <li> My sister, who is a hair stylist, recommended this shampoo and conditioner to me. She said it&#x27;s the best she has ever used and that it makes her color last longer than other shampoos. I was really excited to try this! Her recommendations for me are usually spot on. However, while I felt my color was holding nicely, there was a huge drawback for me. I naturally have oily hair, so I do have to wash my hair every morning. However, with this product, my hair would look oily by mid-afternoon! This is super-frustrating to me because my hair would look wet or greasy, especially at the base of my neck and around my face. I have short hair too, which makes it really noticeable. The shampoo feels a little waxy to the touch, which must have something to do with how my hair gets greasy by the end of the day. I have since quit using this product and will give the remainder of it to my sister.</li>
    <li> I bought this because wen cleanser for colored hair was drying out my hair. I&#x27;ve used Lanza moisturizing shampoo and had good results so I tried this duo because I don&#x27;t want color fade. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and so far seems to clean well without too much fading. Leaves my hair a bit dry so I may try another conditioner with this. It doesn&#x27;t get super sudsy more foamy. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Smells floral and I don&#x27;t see a lot of hair loss after using this and hair looks pretty good.</li>
