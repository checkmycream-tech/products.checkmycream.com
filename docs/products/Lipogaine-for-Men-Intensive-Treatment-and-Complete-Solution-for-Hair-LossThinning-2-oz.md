<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. i have been using Lipogain for about a year now and i can see a difference in the thickness of my hair. The first six months i used it twice a day as recommended, then I have gone to once a day. I highly recommend this product over Ovation cell therapy.</li>
    <li> it did take over 3 months but I have noticed that my hair is thicker, I&#x27;m not losing much hair anymore but my hairline has not come back down. I would give it 5 stars but like I said my hairline has not changed. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if you notice lots of hair loss in the first 1 to 3 months. I have been using lipogaine for over a year now and I am very satisfied. I also take finasteride / propecia, along with hair vitamins with my lipogaine. I believe using all three of these things in combination help me keep my hair. For the price of lipogaine you should at least give it a try because if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re going to lose your hair anyway. I only use it before bed, once a day.</li>
    <li> A picture tells a thousand words! This is progress in the course of five months.</li>
    <li> Has been working very well, been using for several months.  I will say if they could make a foam version that would be awesome.</li>
    <li> Very useful product. Lipogaine has helped me recover hair in my hairline which is something no other product I have tried in the past has done. I went through rogaine, procede, revivogen, castor oil, and various shampoos with no success. I have had noticeable regrowth in my temples which seems impossible to get from any product in the market. One point that is worth mentioning is that you must be patient as the results take time to become visible. This product won&#x27;t fail you if you stick to it for a while so don&#x27;t lose hope and give lipogaine a try.</li>
    <li> My wife pointed out that the back of my head what people are calling the crown area was thinning. I checked it out in the mirror and freaked out I never in a millon years thought this would happen to me so I did my homework online trying to find the best thing I can do to reverse this thinning process. That&#x27;s when I came across Lipogaine saw that it had a bunch of good reveiws and the price wasen&#x27;t at all bad. I was on the fence if this product would really work or not but I gave it a shot anyways results didn&#x27;t come right away on the box it states that it usually takes about 6 months before you see any growth. After 6 month I did notice that the crown area where my hair was thinning was starting to close in. It&#x27;s safe for me to say that this product does indeed work you just need to give it some time. Buy it apply it regularly and you&#x27;ll soon see the results you would exspect from this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best topical anti-hair loss solution that I&#x27;ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;No itchiness or inflammation for me.&lt;br /&gt;It works better than minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair regrowth? I&#x27;m not sure, I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;But definitely strengthens and thickens existing hair so it looks and feels like you have more.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for a 1 year and I gotta say that it works pretty well on thinning areas. As long as you&#x27;re consistent with your application and use it as directed, you will see hairs growing back.This is by far the best regrow product out there. I use it along with the Big 3 shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lipogaine product for about 1 year now.  I apply this to my hair once a day.  Overall I am happy with the result.  I can’t say I am seeing my hair re-growing, but I feel I am not losing as much.&lt;br /&gt;I have a receding hairlines 5 years ago.  With the Lipogaine use, the tinning seems to be slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, the yellow color and smell of the product didn’t really bother me much.  The smell is mild, and it goes away within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Rogaine for a short time, but Lipogaine works better to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I like this product and it works fine for me.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t any better then regular generic minox. Just a bunch of ineffective added ingredients to justify the ridiculous price.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine has significantly slowed further hair loss for over two years now, when regular minoxidil did absolutely nothing for me. It also stops scalp itch that was horrible when I wasn&#x27;t using the product and that resumes if I miss a day for whatever reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it didn&#x27;t reverse my hair loss and hasn&#x27;t stopped it completely, I do wish I started using it sooner, and would recommend trying it at the first sign of a problem. I lied to myself for two years after I first noticed a receding hairline before trying anything, and it&#x27;s time I can&#x27;t get back now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the hair loss sucks, but the scalp itch had a profound impact on my everyday activities. Other products had no impact or even worsened the itch. I&#x27;d have gone insane by now if Lipgaine didn&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> About a year ago have noticed thinning/receding on the temples and front hair line. Did some research and decided to go with this product and been using it ever since. It&#x27;s been maintaining and recently I have noticed some growth (on my hair line where i have been applying it). I see some reviews where people except some kind of miracle to happen. You gotta be realistic, your hair is not going to grow over night and in most cases you will never have the hair you had when you were a teenager. But a product like this one can certainly help, and if you can at least maintain it i would say its being successful. I also have read you can use this with a combination of an oral drug (finasteride) for maximum results, i might look into that once this starts to lose effectiveness. Ohh and the year i have been using this product i haven&#x27;t experienced or noticed any side effects. i use it twice a day once in the morning and once in the evening as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to everyone</li>
    <li> I started using regular minoxidil about 20 years ago and it stopped (or at least slowed way down) the thinning of my hair. About 3 years ago the minoxidil seemed to start losing it&#x27;s effectiveness and I started losing the battle of the balding again. At this time I decided to add Lipogaine to my regimen and after a month or two I noticed that the thinning once more stopped and I started to see regrowth again. This has been true now for these three years. What I have been doing to save some money is use .25 mL for each the front, middle and back of the top of my head and then use about .25 - .50 mL of generic inexpensive minoxidil over all my head again to compliment the Lipogaine. This stretches the Lipogaine out for much longer than a month. If money is not an issue then I would recommend using more Lipogaine on the areas you are concerned about. Lipogaine also has more consistency and does not run as much as regular minoxidil. I can put Lipogaine on and wait a few minutes and comb my hair and can hardly tell I put anything on. One more tip for some who need or will need it: as long as you can keep some type of hair on thinning areas of your head that is all products like Caboki need in which to cling to and give you an illusion of a nice head of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now. I&#x27;m in my early twenties and started noticing some slight thinning on my hair line. I began using the product to try and limit the amount of recession. Since I started using it, i haven&#x27;t noticed any increased thinning. I have some slight hair regrowth around my temples and few hairs have grown around the middle of my hairline. I use the product regularly after I shower and before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would caution those who are just starting out to not expect results immediately. You may also see more hair falling out, which is normal when you first start using this product.</li>
    <li> We tried this product cause my husband started complaining of his hair loss, he has been very happy with it says his hair seems thicker and is growing in spots where he was losing all of his hair!!</li>
    <li> no ingredients on the bottle, no info on what is exactly in the bottle&lt;br /&gt;have been using it for a month.. seeing no effect!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to work?, even though I only apply it once a day. It&#x27;s easy to apply and it dries fast. I will keep using!</li>
    <li> I began shedding a lot of hair a couple of months after a big move/break-up. I did some research and found that this product seemed to be a favorite. I have used it twice a day ever since, so I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 3 years. After using this product for a few months, my hair stopped shedding and slowly began to fill back in. My hair loss was on the right top area of my head and stretched to the crown area. Now I have a perfectly full head of hair at 35 years old. I recommend this product very strongly due to my good experience with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Kirkland Minoxidil and DS Laboratories Spectral.DNC products before. You&#x27;ll notice that Lipogaine has ingredients that the others don&#x27;t have, such as apple polyphenol.  I&#x27;ll take all the ingredients I can get to fight hair loss.  Lipogaine dries quickly when applied to the scalp.  This comes in handy especially before going to bed, since you have to apply this product twice a day.  It also has low viscosity, so it spreads evenly on your scalp.  I massage the product into my scalp with my fingertips after applying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for almost 2 years and the results have been consistent.  It says you&#x27;re supposed to use it twice a day but it is very difficult to keep up with that therefore I usually only use it once per day with occasionally skipping a day.  But all in all I&#x27;m very happy with the product and hair growth was really good during the first 6 months of using the product but in the last year has only maintained hair growth.  I do still have hairs falling out every day though but fortunately I have maintained my current amount of hair over the last year.  This may be due to only using the product once per day though...  Ryan, Michigan</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s helping me regrow my hair, but it&#x27;s certainly slowing the loss process, and I appreciate that immensely.</li>
    <li> The Lipogaine Intensive Treatment is a very high-quality Minoxidil (5%) product. In addition to Minoxidil, it has several other ingredients that help block the effects of DHT and stimulate hair growth: Saw Palmetto, Biotin, and DHT blocker proprietary blend. Previously, I had used Rogaine foam for two years. I found that the Rogaine foam makes the hair very sticky and flat. The Lipogaine product uses a dropper to get the product directly on the scalp as opposed to on the hair where it cannot be absorbed. The product dries within 10 minutes and will not leave the hair flat. You can style your hair as needed once the product is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the product for 2.5 months so I can&#x27;t say for sure if new hair will grow as a result of continual use. I can say that the product will at least slow and maybe stop further hair loss. In order to see the full effect, the product must be used continuously for 6 months. I plan to continue this product at least until that time frame. So far, it is the best Minoxidil product I have tried.</li>
    <li> The best Minoxidil product currently on the market. I have been using Lipogaine for a while now (currently on my 10th bottle) and can see a noticeable difference, particularly on the crown. What separates from others? It&#x27;s not runny; it smells better; it&#x27;s consistent; it&#x27;s complete - adds B vitamins and biotin among others.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine on and off for about 2 years now when I noticed that my hair started shedding. Originally they had azelaic acid in their formula which I loved, and when they took it out I stopped using the product. After trying other products I missed the results Lipogaine have me, so I decided to try it out again even though the azelaic acid was not in the formula anymore. I was pretty surprised to see that the results were pretty much just as good as before. To be honest I think it may have been like 15 % better with the azelaic acid in the formula BUT it still works wonders. This product is great and if you are thinking about using it just know there is a bit of a shedding phase which is normal. I wish I took before and after pictures but I stand by this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old and my hair has been noticeably thinning for the past four years or so. I have tried MANY different products with little to no success. When I started using Lipogaine early in December, I looked like a man who was clearly loosing his hair. Now after almost five months the difference is obvious and dramatic. I look like my old self again. Several coworkers have told me they like how I’ve been cutting my hair and one relative who I haven’t seen in a few months told me that my hair is “All lush now!” I use Lipogaine twice a day and have only missed one evening dose since I started. I also recomend Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo several days a week as well as Biosil and ReserveAge Keratin booster. But these only play a supportive role in hair growth. I know that not everyone will respond as well as I have, but it’s worth trying to see how you fare.</li>
    <li> this is the third time I uses this product the only problem its leave the hair so dry and not manageable</li>
    <li> I tried 2 bottles, which lasted for about 10 months.  I only applied on the \\&quot; temples\\&quot; around my receding hairline and although it seems something was working, it was just a hassle to apply it twice a day. The product is a little sticky and a little messy and it gets frustrating to try to work around it, in the morning, when you&#x27;re putting hair gel, and at night, when you have to time the moment you wash your hair/let it dry/apply the product/let it dry/go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict for receding hairline: Too much work for the little results achieved.</li>
    <li> I am convinced that this product is filling in and strengthening my hairline while growing hair on the top of my scalp as well. Combined with a nice quality shampoo this product becomes a very powerful tool in my arsenal against hairloss. I have been a user for several months and will continue to use this fine product. Thanks Lipogaine!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 2 1/2 years now and I love it! I have been using it only on my hairline during that time and it has helped make my hair look much thicker and healthier! I haven&#x27;t seen any hair loss progression since using this product. I will definitely be using this product as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for about 3 years for a thinning hair in the frontal part of the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the product spreads very well and dried quicky.  It doesn;t leave your head looking greasy like a lot of the other product out there.  I have had success in keeping any further loss from happening, and may have had some regrowth.  I know any minoxidil is not ideal treatment for my specific hairloss but I can say this has helped stop the loss from getting any worse if not helped regain some lost ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product to those who are looking for a high quality minoxidil that won&#x27;t leave their head looking gross!</li>
    <li> Tested for 2 months. No good. Makes my head very itchy and when i scratch it, even more hair fall out. I&#x27;m only 21 and my hair is halved every month, going bald soon...  &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This product was recommended because it provided minoxidil and azelaic acid in one formula which is a dynamic combo.  At some point without notifying customers Lipogaine removed azelaic acid.  There is no reason to purchase this now.  I had some good results from this product at first and then nothing which now I come to find out is because they took out the azelaic acid!!  Bottom line don&#x27;t buy, get rogaine foam.</li>
    <li> I am a 26 year old medical student who started using this product around 2 years ago and i can honestly say that i have seen an improvement in the fullness of my hair.  My problem areas were both in the front and on the crown of my head.  After about a couple of months of using this product i could see that my hair appeared fuller and that the product was working.  I would recommend this to anyone who has recently noticed mild to moderate hair loss as this will help give you fuller hair and slow down the rate at which your hair is lost.</li>
    <li> The only hair product that has worked for me. use twice a day morning and night..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair will initiallly fall out then start regrowth. some itching if over use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fish oil and Bioten helps also</li>
    <li> I initially started using Lipogaine for Men due the great reviews it received on Amazon, and due to its ingredients that are proven to stop hair loss. Once I started using Lipogaine, I noticed hair regrowth which was the intended use of this product and is more than enough for me to continue using Lipogaine.  Additionally, I also noticed Lipogaine makes my hair more manageable, thicker, and fuller - it has literally eliminated the need for me to use any other hair products for styling my hair.  For those of you who are trying to stop your hair loss, and trying to regrow hair - this is the best product for you.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping A+ work</li>
    <li> Ive been using it for almost 48 dys and have seen no hair growth yet.still waiting</li>
    <li> after weeks of usage i can assure you this product works a lot better than i expected. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds and hundreds of countless dollars on this kind of medication and non of them are working as good as this, I would recommend this to anyone looking to regrow their hair. Don&#x27;t spend on any other products other than this !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 months. It started to show obvious results just after first month of use. The new hair grow longer and thicker now. I didn&#x27;t have the  dizziness side effect as I had from another famous product. It really works for the forehead also, it may be the only product can do that on the market. I am pretty happy with it so far and plan to keep using it for at least one year and see the long term result.</li>
    <li> I used Lipogaine for a week and started to have severe rash around the neck. Now I have to stop using it. I read a lot of reviews of similar products and many people claimed that rash could be a problem. I thought I could be lucky, but no luck this time. I will wait for the new generation of hair regrowth solutions that will be on market within 5 years according to people who develop them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) In May 2007, U.S. company Follica Inc, announced they had licensed technology from the University of Pennsylvania which can regenerate hair follicles by reawakening genes which were once active only in the embryo stage of human development. It will take a few years to bring this solution to the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) In December 2010, scientists at the Berlin Technical University in Germany revealed they had grown the world&#x27;s first artificial hair follicles from stem cells. Research leader Dr. Roland Lauster said within five years millions of hair-loss sufferers could grow new hair from their own stem cells and have it implanted into their bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have rash from hair growth solution like me, there is hope on the horizon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month and I think it&#x27;s great.  Works better the typical minoxidil products on the market.  Others I&#x27;ve used in the past had an odor or left a white chalky residue.  This product is easily applied and does not have a smell or leave a residue.  I&#x27;ve noticed results as far as thickness and rate and growth.  I like that it comes with more than just the active ingredient.  I will continue to use this product and highly recommend it.  Just try one bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with Regenpure Kit for a year.  I noticed that the first 2 months didn&#x27;t make much of difference.  But starting the 3rd month, hair stopped falling and regrowth is somewhat noticeable.  However, I also found that after about 10 months into using the product, the hair growth effect got weaker.  I guess it&#x27;s like anything your body takes, once it&#x27;s got used to something (caffeine, sugar, antibiotic,...), the results are not as prominent as they first started out.  So I am taking a 2 months break hoping it would give my body a chance to reset.</li>
    <li> This product is far more efficacious than generic minoxidil or even Rogaine. I used the latter two products since turning 21, over the course of 5 years. They worked well enough for a while, but then I noticed my shedding accelerating. At first I added propecia to my routine, but I began noticing side effects almost immediately. I discontinued that and sought a product that included topical DHT blockers. I found both my minoxidil AND DHT solution in Lipogaine. After about 2 months of use, I noticed far less shedding and thicker, fuller hair - including in the temple regions.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product along with their Big 3 shampoo and Nioxin&#x27;s normal to thin hair shampoo (alternating every other day). As the instructions suggest, I am conscious to apply the solution twice a day, and I do not wash my hair afterward. While tempting, it is far better to avoid washing your hair twice in the morning, as that will cause follicle damage and your hair to increasingly appear thinner, as well as prevent the full absorption of the Lipogaine solution into your scalp. You&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s less greasy than generic minoxidil, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, by using the above routine I am happy to say my hair is looking much better than it did 3-4 years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for a year now. It seems to have slowed hair loss, but hair loss/receding of front hair line is still occurring. I bought the product to help with the receding temples areas, but new hair growth does not seem to be occurring, at least in a way that is noticeable. It is also difficult to fix the hair when the product is already in, because it is greasy and gel products don&#x27;t seem to work well with it. However, hair loss does seem to have slowed, which is good...but I was hoping for much more. I&#x27;m scared to get off of it, because I don&#x27;t want to lose what I&#x27;ve helped to slow. I give the product a 3 of 5.</li>
    <li> Only giving four stars as it is too early to determine hair growth.  However, I love that it is pliable after applying and I can style my hair.  Rogaine leaves a stiff mess that brushes out with white flakes.  Lipogaine is so much better!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the Big 3 Shampoo for about 4 months now. So far ,I have to say that I my hair feels thicker. I still have a full coverage but my hair was getting extremely thin. I have been noticing very fine hairs where I haven&#x27;t had noticed hair in quite a few years. I will continue to use it to see if these hairs get even thicker. I want to give it a bit more time. Since, for the most part I have only been using it once a day and not the twice a day as recommended. Simply because the only down side to this product is that it can leave your hair pretty matted down and tacky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product I think for about 2 years, if not a bit longer. I switched over to this from a 15% minoxidil product that has been so far discontinued. I chose this product originally based on the positive reviews.    In addition to Hairomega pills, this product seems to have helped in slowing the rate of hair loss. I can&#x27;t say that I have seen lots of regrowth, however. One drawback is that this product takes a long time to dry. A faster drying product that leaves behind little to no residue would be a godsend, and I&#x27;d likely be able to adhere to two applications per day more regularly. But with my schedule, 1 per day is already difficult enough.    With that said, I will continue to use the product and hope that the rate of loss is slow enough to give me a couple more good hair-filled years.</li>
    <li> It works slowly but it works specially if your hair loss is under 5 years it is a bit hard to pull it all back in 4 months or a year of all products I&#x27;ve tried this is the most effective, But be ware it must be used according to the directions I also place few drops in my forehead hair line to keep it from retracting against my will, overall I&#x27;m happy with the results but need more time to fix the years of damage I hope this help you make the decision,&lt;br /&gt; PS: it is not for women this product like many others cause collagen deficiency to which men are less susceptible.</li>
    <li> This review is in response to an offer from Lipogaine for three free bottles, but what I say here isn&#x27;t slanted by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For several years I used Minoxidil (generic Rogaine), which did indeed provide hair growth on the crown of my head.  Eventually, though, I was only maintaining past progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switching to Lipogaine has produced further hair growth on both crown and temples.  I apply it only once a day, in the morning.  To verify, last summer I went back to straight Minoxidil and soon noticed the tide slowly going out again, confirming that (at least on on my head) Lipogaine&#x27;s additional ingredients do make a difference.  The only downside is a slightly sticky residue it leaves on the hair when dry, but I gladly put up with that for the benefits.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in the morning after I shower. At night I&#x27;ve been using the Minoxidilmax 15% to compliment my use of the Lipogaine in the morning as recommended from some other reviews I&#x27;ve seen.  The 15% is pretty sticky, but the Lipgaine doesn&#x27;t leave as much noticable residue. I was pretty much bald on the crown of my head and very thin in the front of my scalp and receding fast.  My hair is medium blond, but now there are a whole bunch of new light blond hairs popping up between the little growth I had left before using this product.  The hairs are getting thicker each day - literally.  I don&#x27;t normally take the time to review products, but because I&#x27;m already seeing some results I wanted to give this product the props is deserves so far.  I&#x27;ll post an update in a few more weeks to let you know if I continue to have progress.</li>
    <li> This def works but you have to remain consistent and patient.  You don&#x27;t see results until a couple months if any.  Look closer and you will start to see a lot of baby hair but if you stop the baby hair does and doesn&#x27;t become fully grown.  This is more of a lifestyle addition than a treatment for once you stop hair falls off.</li>
    <li> Great product! Can see actual results.  Used this in combination with Regenpure shampoo system as some other Amazon reviewers have suggested and it is by far the best combo I have used so far.  It is not going to give you a full head of hair so don&#x27;t expect magical results.  But, if you consistently use it, after about a month you will see gradual results.  Use it about 2-3 months and you will see hair coming out of places you didn&#x27;t see before! Previously was consistently using Rogaine regular and the foam, but it left my scalp oily (it didn&#x27;t feel good on). Lipogaine dries up quickly so you don&#x27;t have that oily feel. I also see more steady results without hair falling out as much with use of Lipogaine as opposed to Rogaine.  All in all really happy with the results. Keep using it daily and remember to combine with a good anti-hair loss shampoo system and a good diet.  Do your research and pour through the reviews of other users to get suggestions. That&#x27;s what I did and it led me to Lipogaine and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Period. As an African American I was skeptical it would work on my hair...I was wrong. My frontal hairline is back, but most importantly my confidence is back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first your hair will shed, but I&#x27;m currently in my 3rd month and I&#x27;m beyond satisfied with the results. Hang in there for the long term.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have been using the product for six months and have seen noticeable growth during that time.  I would encourage anyone that is experiencing hair loss to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair regrowing products for many years.  This is the first one I see a difference in using it for only 3 months.  Definitely worth trying it.</li>
    <li> After using it for several months, seems is stabilizing the situation and hair look thicker. though haven&#x27;t see many that it turns those fine hairs into thick yet. I will stay patient. Dry very fast and no smell. Give me comfort. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for about 2 years for androgenic hair thinning.  I feel that it slowed the progression of it and even helped to regrow some hair that was lost.  I like that it has the dht blockers. It&#x27;s not cheap but seems to be worth it. I wish it came in a discounted 3 month pack.</li>
    <li> This was working pretty good for me when I first started using, eventually it starting having little effect. So I started using bosley shampoo for thinning hair when i showered as well as this during the day and it actually made for a good combo to stop the hair from falling out and regrowing.</li>
    <li> I had to discontinue the Kirkland&#x27;s 5% Minoxidil and the 5% Target Minoxidil due to a severe rash caused by Propylene Glycol. Based on the list of ingredients, I thought I would give Lipogaine a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did! I alternate it with the 5% Dualgen (without PG), and I am seeing a lot of regrowth. Additionally, my scalp is back to normal, no itching, redness and thick flakes. Highly recommended! Hope this product is never discontinued!</li>
    <li> Just recently I had to stop using Lipogaine when my funds got a little tighter. I switched over to generic Minoxidil and within a few weeks I was losing MUCH more hair in the shower and on my pillow hair than when I was using Lipogaine. I used up my generic supply and switched right back to Lipogaine. It works great to minimize hair loss and provide a bit of hair regrowth. If you are like me and that is what you are looking for, then I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product for now almost 1 month i did not see any hair growth on my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order another bottel its delay almost 5 days behind did not happy with shipping process&lt;br /&gt;I buy this product bec i read all review now i feel some review are fake they are not real hope lipogaine help me abt this&lt;br /&gt;Thank you have a bless day</li>
    <li> We have tried other products that costed a lot more money and saw no results.  But with this one hair is already growing.  A big difference in a short time.  Will keep ordering this one.  It do work.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My hair started thinning when I was 22. By the time I was 24 I decided to take action and got the bosley hair restoration surgery. After the surgery, you&#x27;re told to protect your investment by taking Propecia daily and using a Monoxodil product.  After trying out Rogaine&#x27;s topical product,  I decided to look around to see if there was. better one. Rogaine&#x27;s topical solution had the tendency of making my hair look oily or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soon saw a private product review for lipogain by the hairloss from steroids guy on YouTube.  He recommended it because it wouldn&#x27;t make your hair oily so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  I&#x27;d never go back. My hair looks thicker than it has since high school and you can never tell I&#x27;ve used it.  The trick is continuity.  You must use it DAILY!  Over time yoy will definitely notice results. I would also recommend using a micro dermaroller lightly on your scalp before applying. It seems to absorb better.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine has helped me maintain a good hairline for a couple years now. I know eventually my hairline will recede to the point of no help, but this product has severely reduced the recede rate. I use this product morning and evening on my front hairline and an added bonus is after a rub the solution into my scalp I run my fingers through my hair so it doubles as a styling gel too.</li>
    <li> Good product for frontal lobe balding. It didn&#x27;t have miraculous affects but significantly slowed the progress and helped regrowth a bit. You won&#x27;t see its impact and actually it might speed up the balding when you start using it. You will see its affects after 2-3 months of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside is missing a few dosages can have significant impact over a week or two. Don&#x27;t forget to bring it to your vacation trip. Definitely helps regrowth however don&#x27;t expect a complete full patch back, at least that was the case for me. I would recommend the product to those with frontal lobe balding. I have been using the product over a year and plan on using it in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this treatment as part of an overall regimen along with Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, Pura D&#x27;Or Shampoo and Avodart prescription. I can&#x27;t totally put my finger on which element is working best therefore but the combination has been much more effective than back when I just used Minoxidil and Finasteride, my hair looking generally fuller all around. So I suspect that indeed the added ingredients in Lipogaine help the penetration of the minoxidil component to aid the overall effects. Isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any smell that I&#x27;ve ever noticed so very unlikely to be detected by anyone else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approx. 2 years now. I have not experienced any additional hair loss since I started and have even seen some new hair growth. I use in combination with Bosley shampoo. I&#x27;ve used other products. This stuff works!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and a half now. Before finding Lipogaine I had loss a lot of hair on top over a few years. After using this for about 6 months I can honestly tell that it makes the thin and fine hair you have left thicker and more pronounced. It appears to work very well in making the small hairs longer, thicker. I don&#x27;t think it regrows hair that is gone, but it does help keep the hair you have left from falling out. Wish I had used this sooner.</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend in Ethiopia who was having hair loss and he told me that there is a huge difference since he started using Lipogaine. Now we are ensuring that he never runs out of Lipogaine to not run out hair.</li>
    <li> By the end of the bottle I did notice a slight change.... but now I realize that I don&#x27;t want to use this the rest of my life... and as soon as I stop using it I&#x27;m sure all my hair will fall out.</li>
    <li> Works well but propylene glycol burns and itches after a few months.  Switched to a PG free product, Tribooster.  No irritation because propylene glycol free</li>
    <li> Hey guys, I don&#x27;t work for lipogaine but I&#x27;m going to give it to you straight... This product is a life changer. I mean honestly, look down the review page, have you ever seen a product with so many happy customers itching to tell other people about it. I&#x27;m a 23 year old who started losing his hair at 21. My hair, along with my confidence was thin and receding. I started using rogaine and had good results. Later on I stumbled upon a review of this lipogaine stuff. After a month I started seeing the difference. This stuff doesn&#x27;t play around. Hard to believe such great results from a topical product, but if this solution was a honey, it&#x27;d be Pam Anderson running down the beach in that tight red bathing suit. If it was a man, it would be Arnold Schwarzenegger chowing down on some barbells. Seriously though, just when you think you&#x27;ve hit maximum results... BOOM!!! Something new pops up, whether it be thicker hair, regrowth or hair growing in a place you never thought you&#x27;d see again. The only side affect is.... And this is hard to say... But you&#x27;ll have to start fighting off honeys left and right! Add this miracle worker to your cart, ASAP!</li>
    <li> Hair Loss Treatment is a complex thing. With topical minoxidil, it takes at least 3-5 months of continued used (twice daily) to achieve minimum visible effects and takes 2 years of continued used to achieve maximum results. I have not yet used this product for a continued period of 5 months or greater, so I cannot give the product 5 stars. However, the ingredient profile is very impressive and contains many scientifically proven ingredients to inhibit DHT&#x27;s effect on hair follicles. I have experienced some moderate-heavy shedding with application of this product (which is expected and a sign that something is at work). I don&#x27;t know what this product holds in store for me in the future but I am excited and confident to see results with prolonged use of this product.</li>
    <li> it does work! I also take 1000mcg biotin, and use Lipogaine big 3 shampoo together. I am not sure which product did most of the trick.     But I am afraid of dropping any one of them so I will keep using them.</li>
    <li> It might need longer time or it&#x27;s just me, but the hair is still coming down as usual and what&#x27;s not there is still not there. I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle, but there&#x27;s just no change whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Definitely helping to regrow my hair back combined with the big 3 shampoo.  You need to use this consistently for about two months for noticeable effects. Worth a try if your hair is starting to thin.</li>
    <li> No sign of improvement with this imported product. Not sure all 5 star reviews are fake or from real users. I would probably start with my old Indian brand i.e. Tugain 5% solution (in night) and MX 5% solution (in morning).</li>
    <li> This product is great. When compared to other minoxidil products, lipogaine has been the most consistent in its formulation compared to the other brands I have tried. I have been using this product for about 2 years now and it works, my hair loss has all but stopped, and I have seen regrowth along my hairline. Unlike other brands, this product does not leave your hair feeling greasy or oily. It does provide some body to the hair as well, and I find that it helps to control the frizziness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will say that you must give this at least three months before you start seeing results, so don&#x27;t give up if you aren&#x27;t seeing anything after the first bottle. Like all minoxidil product, if you stop using this, your hair loss will start again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this and Kirkland&#x27;s and a couple of different DS Laboratories minoxidil cocktails.  This is a good medium.  DS Labs was too expensive, but when I switched to Kirklands I had tons of crazy shedding.  This seems pretty good, for a good price.  I use it once a day in the morning and then Nioxin Scalp Treatment System 6 in the evenings, along with sometimes using DS Labs anti-dandruff shampoo and RegenePure nt/Dr. Shampoo and Nioxin Scalp Therapy System 6 conditioner.  It seems to keep my hair from falling out as much.  But I&#x27;ve never seen any regrowth with any product.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 3 month now and I do notice hair growth. Though it is more like peach fuzz but it is some growth. Will continue to use it and see if it would get any thicker. Would recommend product to others.</li>
    <li> I made the jump from Rogaine foam to Lipogaine based on all of the positive product reviews. After using Lipogaine for around 6 months, I have to say that I prefer it over the Rogaine. It definitely slows down the shedding process (I only lose a hair or two each shower) and seems to grow back hair - maybe not as much as I had hoped, but there&#x27;s definitely progress. The hair that has grown doesn&#x27;t seem as strong (it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34;) and seems to stand out among the rest, but it&#x27;s better than nothing. Full disclosure, I don&#x27;t use Lipogaine twice a day as the directions say - I only apply it before bedtime each night. Overall, I would recommend this product and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy that I was told about Lipogaine by a friend.  I was skeptical, but I figured I would give it a shot.  After a few months I noticed the hair growing back in the problem areas that I had.  I have been using this now for over a year and I have seen definite results.  I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> The only Minoxidil product that I have seen with both Azelaic Acid and Saw Palmetto both great DHT blockers, besides the vitamins and retinol. After shampooing and spray apply, I never have heavy sticky or gummy hair. It dries or blow dries without a problem. I have sensitive skin and scalp but no problems from a twice a day application. I use it as a maintenance and works great for me. So much better that any of the drugstore brands I hope it is always available, started using it last year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v been using this for a few years now and I find this to be an effective product for my hair. Though it may not help re-grow hair that is completely lost it can grow hair in places where the follicles are still active or in the process of dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment you realize that you are losing a lot of try using this product. Blaming hair loss on water quality, humidity doesn&#x27;t work as these have an impact on hair loss it is mainly each person&#x27;s genetics. You have to follow a strict regimen and use this product twice a day. You will see noticeable improvement in a month.</li>
    <li> Good news - it works. I have been using it for a while- 3 or 4 month and told nobody except my wife. I only had one comment on it, from a relative of mine telling me I seem to have much more hair now. He said it without me even talking about it or asking about it. So, the product works.&lt;br /&gt;Bad news- it is messy. It is messy and not pleasant to use, it drips to your eyes sometimes etc.Also, the head board on my bed colored in that stuff now and it&#x27;s not easy to get rid of.Or even impossible to clean it of my bed. That is why I switched to other their product - shampoo with the same formula (supposedly). But I really think this product gives better results than shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion : If you are desperate and see a lot of hair loss: buy it, use it 3-4 month and you should see your hair grow. It will not happen overnight or next week, so you know. Just not so pleasant to put it on your hair because it drips and you have to re-order all the time and it&#x27;s 25 bucks! But hey- I have more hair now !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated : since they raised to $30 from 25, I took away two star. It is still works, but for that money I would look at some other products</li>
    <li> TO START ...IM NOT BALD ...I AM SLIGHTLY RECEDING...AS FAR ASVI CAN TELL THIS PRODUCT IS SLOWING DOWN THE RECEDING. I LIKE THIS PRODUCT MUCH MORE THAN THE MINOXIDIL PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This works much better than rogaine. I am using it with  [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]] and my hair loss has completely stopped, and I am seeing a lot of new growth after about  3 months. Amazing combo!</li>
    <li> This treatment is overpriced and did nothing, I have used the other minoxidils, which is 1/6 of the price and that worked better</li>
    <li> Great product! Noticed results within several months of use, one year later it has definitely helped slow down hair loss and has started new regrowth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lipogaine (once per day) for nearly a year now and overall am happy with it and feel it is better than regular minox.  Overall it takes a little longer to dry than generic minox but is not too bad.  There is no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for certain it is better because I have always used it w/ another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If cost is a big issue then it is best to just get the generic minox as you will not see 3x the amount of growth in this product.  However, if the money is not a big deal for the potential of better regrowth than purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company, which used to MinxodilMax before the FDA crackdown on 15% formulations, explains their ingredients rather than using a bunch of BS marketing and hype that some other manufacturers do.  Considering the amount of over-hype snakeoil hair loss products out there it makes me trust this product more than others.  Also I am pretty sure many other products on Amazon have lot&#x27;s of fake reviews, I do not think this is the case for this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. It works well so far for the last six months.  I&#x27;ve had my hair gradually back on the top of my head. It&#x27;s getting thicker and darker too.  I will keep using it and I highly recommend Lipogaine to anyone who is willing to make a change for hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 6 months now and he has worked great for me!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband because his hair really started to thin out on the sides of the top of his head. He used it for 4 months now, applying every morning and night and is very happy with the results. I couldn&#x27;t believe myself that it actually worked. Before the hair started to came back it even looked worse for a while. I have been trying to find an original picture I took of him before he started using this product but only found the one we took after 3 months of using Lipogaine. Before he was almost bold there on the sides. He also switched to Lipogaine Big 3 Premium Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo and is taking Biotin 5000mcg. We just ordered out third bottle of Lipogaine and definitely going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I started noticing my hair thinning around age 30.  I never really did anything about it until a few years ago when the front and top of my head started rapidly thinning.  I looked into Lipogaine and it sounded like a solid product.  I knew Rogaine or the Kirkland brands were cheaper but $25/month was worth it..if it worked.  So I figured I had nothing to loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it, as directed, in April 2013, twice a day...everyday.  At first it was difficult to get used to, but it quickly became part of my morning and evening routines.  I knew it would take a few months to even show any results.  Along with the twice a day application, I also take biotin supplements every day.  I also use the Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo about 2-3 times a week.  So about 2 years later I finally write this review to tell you: it is working for me, with no side effects.  I started noticing little &amp;#34;fill-in&amp;#34; hairs growing around my scalp in about 4 months of initial use.  The growth of very thin hairs seemed to &amp;#34;peak&amp;#34; around 1 year. .  My hair stylist of 4 years always comments on how thick my hair has become.  She had me send her the Lipogaine information for her other clients.  I understand minoxidil is about 85% effective, and I&#x27;m glad to be in the group.  I will continue my 3 part routine as long as it continues to work.  One day genetics will take over and win... but for now I have a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> I used Lipogaine for a month and a half, and I saw noticeable growth in the first week. One bottle lasted for a month exactly as they said. I was only using it on one area at the time, however; the front. I used it in combination with The Big 3 Shampoo (which lasts much longer than the base product), and I advise using both minoxidil and the shampoo. I experienced shedding about a month in which revealed balding on the top of my head due to using the shampoo, unfortunately, but this is normal and necessary for new hair-growth to occur, and that hair would&#x27;ve slowly been lost on its own anyway, so better to deal with it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, it&#x27;s been working even in this relatively short period of use. It seems for me, minoxidil in general worked better at the front than in the back; the back took literally four months to show growth. While the results for this product are true, I switched to an off-brand, liquid minoxidil for nighttime use, and Rogaine foam for morning use. They&#x27;re better in terms of price and quantity by a lot. The Big 3 shampoo is still a product I use and love, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further note on reason for switching:&lt;br /&gt;The shedding that revealed balding on the top of my head as well means I&#x27;ll be using more of a base product, and I doubt it&#x27;ll even last a month at this rate of use. So yes this product works, but I&#x27;m switching due to low quantity in combination with high price above all else. Wish everyone the best of luck with this.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work but it is way too expensive to keep using it. I would have to buy 2 bottles a month. There are shampoos that work better</li>
    <li> Slowed down hair loss.  Easy to apply. Fast delivery. No scent. Immediate results. Works in receding hair line. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product works well. I use it twice a day and notice thickening of the hair on my crown where I apply it.</li>
    <li> omg this made my heart race and dizzy</li>
    <li> Better than other brands, recommend to use it twice a day and take some Vitamins and control diets will help a lot.</li>
    <li> Father is bald, so I decided to be proactive and take lipogaine 2 years ago bc i Started noticing hair thinning slightly. After using hair is fuller no BS. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year now and I have had in general good results with it. Due to it&#x27;s cost I combine it with regular minoxidil so my morning dose is usually the normal strength and the nightly one is lipogaine. I have definitely seen improvement but there is something that I didn&#x27;t like as much. I believe the quality deteriorated over time I noticed the liquid turned from dark yellow to lighter yellow and the consistency in general seemed &#x27;watered down&#x27;. It&#x27;s either that or the density of the liquid between purchases has been inconsistent. I will continue to use it as it is a product that helps and I have seen results. So anyone starting out I say give it a try and if it works for you keep it in your regimen.</li>
    <li> Best product out there , be patient it works !</li>
    <li> I am using it for the past 1 month. It creates dandruff. I do not have it before using it. I dont suggest this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is actually working, you have to apply it consistently for it to work, been using it for almost a year and it somehow halts my MPB. I&#x27;m also seeing new fine hairs, and hopefully will thicken over time. Thanks Lipogaine!</li>
    <li> Lipogaine is a great product for hair loss. I am very satisfied and I will continue using it. Best product so far I tried.</li>
    <li> This product works for me.  I&#x27;ve used consistently and found that it dries quickly and helped limit the shedding.  I prefer this over the other 5% minoxidils. Dries faster than brands I&#x27;ve tried. I would suggest using it if you can not get results elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  However, I only use it at night because it makes my hair greasy in the morning.</li>
    <li> Much better than Rogaine in stopping hair loss and it worked fast. Cheaper and more effective and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This is working for my husband and he has been using it for over a year now with success. He has grown back a little, but has stopped losing hair. This product does not stop him from styling his hair and has a great smell to it. I just wish that it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I definitely recommend it. Due to some stress in my life, and being genetically predisposed to Alopecia, I began to loss tons of hair! So I began try out several products in the hopes of finding something that would prove to stop the hair loss and/or promote regrowth. After arduous research and several attempts, I came across some research on Minoxidil. This chemical was first used in the 70&#x27;s to treat high blood pressure. The people began to grow a lot of hair and the scientists created a topical solution that when applied promotes blood flow on the capillaries and therefore brings the necessary nutrients to the hair bulb to ensure it&#x27;s growth. This product does a great job at infusing Minoxidil with other vitamins and DHT blockers that create a powerful effect. I recommend applying it every day and the results are noticeable after 3 months of daily use. After a year to a year and a half there is a substantial difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since November 2014 and still no full head of hair.  I&#x27;m an optimist, so I&#x27;ll probably be their only customer while the others just stop using it since it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> just wanted to say ty for making this product available.  when acne starts forming for me on outlying areas of hairline and itching i know i&#x27;m in trouble from dht buildup.  the acne and itch stops when using this compound.  thanks for saving my hair friend.  would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 2012 to help mitigate hair loss in my frontal crown. I noticed within the first month that little hairs were growing where previously there was no hair, after a few more months, more little hairs that were slightly thicker would appear. After a few years of use, those areas appear to have filled in about 20-30% from what it was when I first started. At this point, I feel that the product has slowed down hair loss in my crown and its interesting to check every month or so to see how my hairline has changed. Usually I will notice shorter hair in my crown that is about 1/3 to 1/2 the length of the hair on the top of my head and that is thinner. Lately I have noticed a few of those previously shorter/thinner hairs are thick and long just like the hair on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion to those who use it is to follow the instructions and do not miss treatments. That sounds like a no-brainer, but if you miss applications here and there, you may notice the effectiveness plummet. I also like the new formula as it is less thick than the previous formula, its gelatinous enough for me now to help style my hair like a lightweight pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a good shampoo and conditioner. I use Ketoconazole shampoos like Nizoral and have even gotten a prescription from my doctor of 2% Ketoconazole shampoo. For the last year I have been using the Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo which works excellently in combination with the Nizoral or alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a thickening hair conditioner called Formula 500 that I bought on Amazon, this is something I am still working on as I am cycling through different brands for a conditioner I really like. But it makes my hair feel soft after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I take a biotin supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that helps, definitely has changed my hairline and is buying me time for sure while growing some new hairs back.</li>
    <li> I always had fears of growing bald since my father is bald. I shaved my head down to the wood after I turned 21 because I was noticing some hair loss. Finally after 3 years I decided to let my hair grow out again and there were some bald patches. I tried a lot of products and I can honestly say that I trust Lipogaine the most. I have been using it for around 3 years and hair loss has stopped and my hair looks fuller. Thanks Lipogaine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since the PerfectImage super-concentrated Minoxidil solution was discontinued a few years back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works nearly as well as the PerfectImage one did. It&#x27;s also relatively easy to apply and dries quickly, which is a plus. Because it dries quickly I can apply it right before I go to bed and not get it all over my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle comes with a dropper applicator which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with Finasteride (Propecia). It works much better if you&#x27;re taking Propecia or generic Finasteride, and works reasonably well if you aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+Reasonably effective&lt;br /&gt;+Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;+Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;+Super fast shipping and delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive - this will cost you 4 times more than generic Minoxidil&lt;br /&gt;-It claims to last a month per bottle, but my bottles only last 10 - 12 days each. The bottles are very small.</li>
    <li> I was loosing hair since I was 16, now 23, this made the hair loss stop and I regrow a considerable amount of hair in 2 months of use. I have been using it for almost 2 years now consistently and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I use along side with the Lipogaine big 3 shampoo which helps prevent hair loss even further. Best 1-2 punch on the market.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 6 months, I have been happy with product and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair regrowth products over the past several years. Nothing compares to Lipogaine in stopping hair loss. My hair has even grown back along the front hairline. It would be hard to live without Lipogaine after seeing the results. I highly recommend Lipogaine for anyone struggling with hair loss.</li>
    <li> A little over 5 years ago I was experiencing abnormal hair loss and became very frustrated. Several people recommended propecia and Rogaine, the most well-known hair loss products. I avoided propecia due to side effects but did try Rogaine foam and serum. Both were okay but caused me to have a very itchy and burning scalp, causing me to finally stop taking it. I was scouring the internet for alternative solutions and came across Lipogaine and their great reviews. Since the great find, I have used Lipogaine daily. I apply the solution at night, massaging the solution throughout the most impacted areas. The dropper which is included with each bottle works perfectly to help target the worst areas.  The results have been great and I can’t stress how awesome it is that Lipogaine does not come with any side effects. Lipogaine is a hidden gem in the hair loss care product arena and is very affordable.</li>
    <li> No real benefit to hair loss... shame on me for hoping</li>
    <li> I used Rogaine for several months before trying this. As you can tell by the ingredients, as well as using it, it&#x27;s a more comprehensive product. I have achieved better results than by solely using Rogaine. Even though they&#x27;re both marketed at 5% minoxidil, I believe this is more potent. I often get headaches after using Lipo, which is a symptom of minox overdose. I&#x27;ve found the best method is to use 1/2 dose of each, no more headaches.</li>
    <li> I switched over to Lipogaine as my minoxidil solution around a year ago and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The fact that Lipogaine applies and dries in a matter of minutes makes it worth the money. No more greasy hair or residue! Put it in and a few minute later brush it out. In addition, the biotin, while not actually responsible for growing hair, has made my existing follicles in the areas I treat thicker and healthier.</li>
    <li> My husband is using this product for over a year and I think it working for him.  He does have a lot of hair loss so it is taking time , but I can see the difference.  There is more hair developing on the treated areas.  It is not a quick fix, but if you faithfully use the product as directed and be patient it you will see results. It is easy to use, he uses it in the morning and evening and there is no discomfort or funny smells.  Not a full head of hair yet, but it is definitely seeing progress especially at the back of the head and he is not loosing anymore.  My husband never runs out and always wants to make sure he has it on hand.  I would recommend this to those you are dealing with thinning and hair loss.</li>
    <li> its really a good product, its working ,i love lipogaine, my hair doesn&#x27;t fall , and i have new hairs grown on my hairline,i am using this product almost more than year,its working very good , thanks for lipogaine, better than rogaine , it works ,it works ,it works</li>
    <li> I have been using lipogaine for approximately 2 years, I started to see results after about 4&#x3D;6 weeks. I have been using this product with a vitamin (biotin) supplement and a medicated shampoo (nizoral AD). I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but after giving it a fair trial, saw results and continued to purchase. My hair is continuing to fill in and I am 67 years young.  WBM</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for Men for about 2 years to the point that it now has become part of my daily routine. Immediately after I shower while my hair is still damp but not soaking wet I grab my Lipogaine dropper and apply it to the back of my head where my balding starts. A little goes a long way so I completely cover most of the back of my head with one application, it only takes just a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is not using the product earlier at the first signs of losing hair but I guess I was in denial. I have definitely seen an improvement in my balding area and I will continue using the product to maintain what I have and if I do grow new hair I&#x27;ll take it as an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 6 moths months now and people tell me they see new thin hair in my hair, it is actually working!! My bald friends already asked me the link so they can purchase it too!, now some recomendations from my personal experience:  1) Use it two times a day per indications 2) DO NOT use hats, beannies, etc it will make the new hair to fall as head needs oxygen 3) Do not go totally bald while letting this to grow, you can use size #2 or #1 of trimmer in the meantime (I know bald it is better to avoid hairless zones to be seen, but it is a sacrifice) 4) use the shampoo each 3 days (for instance Monday, Thursday, Sunday, etc)  Hope you guys have same real results just like me  Hope to have great results in 6 months :)</li>
    <li> I believe it might have helped to stop the loss of my hair, but I don&#x27;t see a much fuller hair line.</li>
    <li> Great product. Been using it for years now-- about 4-5 total. It is the base for my whole hair loss regimen. I previously used generic minoxidil, but was unhappy with the itchiness, residue, and dandruff it inevitably left behind. This product--even with the composition changes it has incurred over the last few years-- does a much better job of cutting out those unwanted side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual hair: This product has definitely made a difference. I do not think I have gained much if any hair, but my hair loss has slowed significantly. I started using this product in my early 20&#x27;s when I first noticed hair loss around my temples. I knew the ubiquitous &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; shaped hair pattern was not too far behind. Almost every single male on both sides of my family, past and present, has suffered from baldness. Those whom are unaffected started using finasteride at a young age. I, on the other hand, stubbornly eschew use of any oral hair loss medications for reasons well documented on other sites. When I first started, I hoped a single medication would hold me over. Fast forward a half decade later later and my hair line has changed little. I have also become more astute in my hair regimen. For optimal absorption, I use a 1.5 microdermaroller. I have, also, just recently, starting mixing careprost/latisse into my bottle of lipogaine. For the hairloss junkies who pour over hair loss forums for a magical mix of potions, the lipogaine/careprost mix may be something to look into. For me, for the last three months on lipogaine/careprost, the hair shedding has decreased significantly more and the feel of my hair has changed also. I understand the uneasiness some may assume with my non-scientific speak, but as a lay person and hair loss junkie, I have to say the lipogaine/careprost regimen is compelling. At the very least, and for purposes of this review, lipogaine is a substantial foundation for any regimen you may intend to pursue.</li>
    <li> I have always been afraid of losing my hair at such a young age of 21, when I first realized I was shedding constantly and not growing the hair back fast enough I decided to look into lipogaine hair loss treatment; and I never regretted it. This product works amazingly, and it&#x27;s results are spectacular! I have seen fast results in just a few months with little to no side affects! I&#x27;m glad there is a treatment for hair loss that actually works. I highly recommend Lipogaine to anyone who is willing to make a change for the better.</li>
    <li> I tried many products but no results.  Finally, I found this. It works like magic. The only problem in my opinion is that you must use it forever or you will lose the results.</li>
    <li> Great Product, works as advertised. Seems to keep my hair feeling and looking healthier.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for about two years now. The product is easier to apply than Rogaine and can be applied throughout the scalp. Rogaine is formulated only to the vertex of the scalp. The product is not greasy, easily absorbed dries quickly. As far as minoxidil 5% goes, by far this is the best product out there. I wished the company would lobby the FDA to bring back minoxidil 10%.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for well over six months now to combat a receding hairline, and though I cannot say my hairline is restored, I can say it hasn&#x27;t receded any further (not sure if that can be attributed to the product or not). I gave this 3 stars because, although it didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping for, I have noticed little hairs growing, but nothing substantial. Maybe in another six months I&#x27;ll get the results I want, and if that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;ll update my review to reflect that. Unfortunately, I cannot say as to whether or not this is for you, but it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot. If you have a receding hairline, I don&#x27;t really recommend this at the moment based on my personal results (or lack thereof). However, if you are suffering from male pattern baldness and vertex loss, I&#x27;d say give it a go. I&#x27;ve heard people have had great luck with this and if anything at all is going to tackle your balding woes, this is as good (if not better) a choice as any. Stay tuned for my post year update!</li>
    <li> I have been having hair problems for over 5 years now and have tried many different products with little success. I thought of giving Lipogaine a try, have been using it for about 6 months now. It took about 3 - 4 months before I started seeing satisfactory results, it may differ person to person. It has helped in arresting hair fall and also in regrowing some hair. The texture of hair has also improved, and it does not leave an itchy feeling on scalp after application.</li>
    <li> using this as an addition to my hair treatment routine...it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than the monoxidil you can buy at Target or Cosco, but this product contains other ingredients that I feel are important to keeping the hair that you have healthy and in place. I&#x27;ve done some research and this formula has the 5% monoxidil plus B vitamins, biotin and niacin...not to mention other ingredients that help keep your hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I used this for about 3 weeks now.  Looks like there already more hair than before, do not know it just hair looks thicker or it did grow more.  But one thing make me worried is that after applying this product, my hair become  very dry. So now I use once two day instead of twice per day.</li>
    <li> Great product indeed! I&#x27;ve noticed hair regrowth and my hair appears thicker. Great results, and will continue to purchased this product as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
    <li> i have been using lipogaine for over a year now and am having great results. my have is coming back slowly and i am definitely not losing it anymore, which i will be happy with. i usually apply two full droppers every night before sleeping and wash it off in the morning. sometimes i even apply one full dropper in morning after washing and drying my hair and leave it on all day.</li>
    <li> By now we should all be aware that most haircare products that promise hair regrowth are not really proven to do so. Save yourself the money and cut your hair shorter.</li>
    <li> Do not buy, all it will do is dry out your remaining hair. It looks like the formula was changed and now it&#x27;s totally worthless, you will find better alternatives in amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for about ten months and was very happy with it until about three months ago when I suddenly noticed that I was losing all the hair I had gained in the previous seven months. Of course I initially didn&#x27;t blame Lipogaine until I realized that they secretly had dropped a key DHT blocker - Azelaic Acid! Now I concede that the jury is out on AA as some folks are convinced that it does very little for hair loss. Others maintain that it reduces the amount of DHT in the scalp by greater than 98%! But if they didn&#x27;t believe it was working when they started out - why take it out now? And why do it without mentioning anything to their existing customers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given Ockham&#x27;s razor - if in doubt the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should be selected. In other words, the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. I personally believe that this cannot be coincidence as I saw a massive improvement and regrowth until about three months ago after which I experienced increasing hairloss again. I have not changed my lifestyle in any way but that was about the same time when Lipogaine reformulated their product - this time without Azelaic Azid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point Lipogaine is nothing but an expensive 5% and sticky Minoxidil solution. I wrote them several inquiries about this but they never responded as to why they took it out. Given that I have to resort to the lowest rating possible. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to cheapen a product once a brand has earned a good reputation - resting on their laurels will bite them in the rear in the end. If anyone has noticed more hair loss in the past three months please respond to this review.</li>
    <li> And... I&#x27;m back to using Lipogaine.  I first used Lipogaine a little while back with some great success.  Success to me meant I stopped looking at my head in front of the mirror every morning thinking I&#x27;m gonna look just like my dad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most reviewers, it did take me a few months of consistency and patience to get there.  After that I went into &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; mode and applied it only once a day before bed.  I was still able to keep what I had grown this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too long ago, I saw that Costco had a 6 pack and switched and now I&#x27;m freaking out again.  I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s all the other ingredients in additional to the minoxidil that makes Lipogaine work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back on Lipogaine and once I&#x27;m back to &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; mode, I&#x27;m gonna not go cheap again.  It&#x27;s well worth the price of what I might spend eating dinner one night to not lose my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did experience dry scalp as a side effect.  To relieve it, about once a week, I would mix a couple tbsp of aloe vera with a few drops of argan oil and rub it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Im a African American male and this product is the best!!  before i was bald at the sides, hairline, top and back.... now after 4 months everything is filling in greatly.  the only part that is still bald is part of my hairline. I have more of a &amp;#34;m&amp;#34; shape instead of the horseshoe. its a small &amp;#34;m&amp;#34;.... Im surprised this worked so good.  I have been balding since I was 19. Im almost 30 and I will continue to purchase .. for the past 4 months i have bought 1 bottle a month because i was unsure but now I may buy the 3 month supply since i know it works.. if your skeptical just buy one month.. dosent hurt... im sure we all spent more than  $25 on stupid things....</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months twice a day. I have noticed that i am losing a lot less hair than before when i shower. i recommend it</li>
    <li> lthe differance after a month of use</li>
    <li> very effective product. I make sure that I never run out</li>
    <li> Im gonna make it short Very good product requires at least well for me  took 7 weeks to c any results I shedded hair in the beginning but it&#x27;ll get bttr patience is a virtue my friends</li>
    <li> This a great product that actually works. I saw results within the first 3 months and I&#x27;ve been using it since then. I really love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Lipogaine for Men hair regrowth formula (minoxidil)  and the Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo for 6 months now. I am  definitely seeing regrowth in both the receding areas on the back and on the front of my scalp. Prior to Lipogaine I was using Rogaine foam and Nioxin shampoo.  The Rogaine and Nioxin were helping to maintain the hair I have, but I was not seeing much re-growth. I still use the Rogaine in the mornings as I like the way I can style my hair with the foam (works similar to a mousse). I use the Lipogaine minoxidil formula every evening. I use the Lipogaine shampoo 3 times a week and still use Nioxin shampoo the other days. The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars (yet) is I want to give it another 3 - 6 months  since I currently only use the Lipogaine regrowth treatment once a day. The shampoo works well too, and it contains a conditioner (and so sulfates, which is less harsh on your scalp).</li>
    <li> I have tried several different formulations of minoxidil containing products and I have experienced the best results with Lipogaine.</li>
    <li> 26yr old male, noticed a little general thinning from the back (vertex) towards the front of the top of my head and a little recession at the temples. I started using Rogaine foam (5% Minoxodil) twice a day morning/bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 2-3 weeks: Hit the shedding phase which is super scary bc my hair was falling out like crazy! I wanted to stop but upon extensive internet research I confirmed this is normal and in fact means it is working. DO NOT STOP HERE! It will be in vain! Minoxidil forces your follicles into the growth phase, which begins by first shedding old strands for new ones (should last no more than 2 wks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-5 weeks: My hair loss began decreasing steadily. After the 2nd Month I switched to this product since it has some extra ingredients to increase penetrance, disrupt DHT, and I wanted the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m at six months...no hair loss! Haven&#x27;t seen a single hair in the shower or on my book pages for months! I can see a little baby hair growth along my temples, it&#x27;s hard to tell if I&#x27;m growing anywhere else yet but at least I&#x27;m not losing anymore :D From the sounds of it, regrowth takes some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is a little tedious. I kind of put a few drops then sway my head around so it trickles about, then a few more drops, etc... I&#x27;ve also been taking Biotin and Saw Palmetto supplements daily, use shampoo w/ salicylic acid (Neutrogena T/Sal), and a Bosley conditioner. I highly recommend this product as part of a \\&quot;big three\\&quot; treatment (Minoxodil + Biotin + Antifungal shampoo). The shampoo should have either salicylic acid, or better, ketoconazole as the active ingredient. It gets expensive month after month but well, you want hair? Feel free to question/comment! Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Saw so many good reviews here and wanna give it a try. I used for about 3 weeks already and didn&#x27;t see any improvement yet.</li>
    <li> I started noticing my hair was thinning out a couple years ago and so like many people I started freaking out!  I started researching about different products and tried a few others before this one.  The other products stained my clothes or made my head really itchy.  I delt with it for a while only to keep finding hair all over the place (more than normal).  I watched a YouTube video that promoted this and figured Id do more research on it.  I cant say I noticed much more hair growing back, but I certainly stopped seeing my hair all over the place.  I use the Lipogaine shampoo as well and between the two my hair has been doing well.  I will definitely keep using these products!</li>
    <li> There is no cure for hairloss, but this is the best we have without messing with hormones(propecia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is superior product to rogaine. It contains the same concentration of minoxidil(the active ingredient), but it also contains a proprietary blend. Sadly the FDA banned minoxidil products that contain Azelic acid, but I am willing to bet Lipogaine&#x27;s &amp;#34;Azetinol&amp;#34; is Azelic acid, which is a topical DHT blocker. Overall I saw better results with Lipogaine after using it for 2 months than I saw with Rogaine foam after 5 months. It&#x27;s more expensive, but if you can afford it, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> 5 weeks into this product, on the second bottle, so far no drastic changes, but the labels reads it can take up to 6 months to see improvement... tune in for further review</li>
    <li> Really notice a difference in the fullness of my hair, both on my crown and hairline.  Gotta be patient though, it only starts working after around 3 months of solid day/night use.  You can really start seeing results after 6 months and beyond.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Definitely works. You have to use it twice a day as recommended. When I lower the dosage or stop using it eventually the results will go away and your hair will start thinning again. I recommend using this with a derma roller on areas of the scalp where hair is thinning.</li>
    <li> It did work for me, initially. I have been experiencing really bad dandruff since two weeks. I had to buy anti-dandruff shampoo to supplement.</li>
    <li> So bottomline: I&#x27;m 19 and have a widows peak. I noticed that part of my head was thinning hard and thought i might try this. Been using for over 2 months and not pleased, in fact I kinda wish I never started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first bottle was a darker yellow than the second but both did not contain the azelaic acid people rave about and the FDA took away. I bought a second bottle because I was going into this for 3 months. Well its been a little over 2 months and I have a widows peak so those areas were balding and let me tell you, this product just doesn&#x27;t work. I was really excited after the first month when the thinning stopped and some small hairs sprouted, that excitement has now just turned into disappointment. This product I think made me go bald in areas I wasn&#x27;t going to go bald in for some time and the widows peak is just as it was before I started using the product. I really do not know what to use now because this product was my first hair loss product and I am currently starting over. Granted it has only been 2 months and the label says to wait 3 so I will update come Christmas with whether or not this product did anything but I have no hopes for it to be positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product and I don&#x27;t know if the pre-FDA formula would have worked but me being an activist I&#x27;m sure it would have and it&#x27;s just another thing the FDA took from us. I might just use a DHT blocker shampoo just to stop any more thinning because I hear the foam doesn&#x27;t work and the generic is no better than this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do still intend to use this let me say that the product dries fast and it doubles as your styling product as well. I never used my axe hair gel because this product let me style my hair the way I wanted. The application is a bit messy but it would never be a complaint of mine how messy any product is as long as it regrew my hair. During the first month I became super bald, I lost all confidence but just stuck with it because that&#x27;s what everyone says to do and my hair is much better than it was one month ago but now there are a lot of bald spots in my hair and I don&#x27;t think that should&#x27;ve happened and I should&#x27;ve never started using this. However, I can live with what this product did to my hair as I will just switch to a DHT blocking shampoo and just not cut the top hair only sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope soon that there will be a breakthrough in hair regrowth but for now, this product was the best and now it has only gotten worse and does not work. I hope you guys find this helpful and who knows maybe after 4 more weeks I&#x27;ll have hair like I did at 17 but I can only laugh at that statement right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace</li>
    <li> Use this product in conjunction with BIG 3 Shampoo.  This hair serum does not leave any oily residue, dries quickly.  Use it morning and night faithfully.  Hair that was once thin is not thicker after two months of use.  Plan to use this product as I seem to be regaining hair that I had thought was gone for good.  Thanks again for a great product!</li>
    <li> I used to use this product religiously when it was known as &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Lipogaine for Men: Minoxidil Enhanced with Azelaic Acid DHT Blocker, Biotin, Vitamin, Intensive Treatment &amp; Complete Solution for Hair Loss / Thinning.  Then they made a stealthy and unpublicized change to their product formula....and no good since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was thicker and growing back. Friends and even my barber noticed and quite impressed. But later I noticed my hair was not doing as well as before.  After reordering time after time your product I realized they TOOK OUT &amp;#34;Azelaic Acid&amp;#34; and bingo that was such a big turn off and deceptive.  So I stopped buying products. The previous formula was far superior with the Azelaic acid.  Now it&#x27;s nothing more than minoxidil that can be purchased everywhere and cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great minoxidil product I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little less than two years. In that time I&#x27;ve seen some thickening and regrowth in the crown and temple regions.  During that time I have used no other hair loss treatments like finasteride or ketoconazole shampoo, but I am considering those to augment my results.  Lipogaine dries fast so it is little trouble applying it twice a day. I can still style my hair once it is dry. I do experience less scalp irritation with Lipogaine than with generic liquid minoxidil.</li>
    <li> Even a star is to much for this product. Thanks to this I lost the hair I had left.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using it for five months now, and my hair loss has stopped, Minoxidil is known for its properties of stimulating hair growth and this product contains DHT blockers and nutrients everything in a single bottle.&lt;br /&gt;For best results use with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willy</li>
    <li> 1. Buy a 3 month supply (to get started)&lt;br /&gt;2. Use as directed&lt;br /&gt;3. Watch you hair stop falling out and grow back&lt;br /&gt;Read the other reviews&lt;br /&gt;My personal experience was that I did not loose additional hair and I started to see a differance in the second month</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products over the years to combat hair loss and now after three months I can say this one works the best! I am seeing good regrowth in areas that did not respond to regular minoxidil. It may not work for everyone but of all the products available it definitely has worked the best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really that picky, and all I really want is a product that works with no negative side effects. I&#x27;ve used a bunch of products and most of them were just crap. I limited my treatment options down to HairIntegro and Lipogaine. Some cheaper treatments had given me a skin rash after I&#x27;d used it, and one oral supplement made me sick to my stomache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here&#x27;s a breakdown of what happened with lipogaine: I used it for about 3 months, and it was starting to work as far as I could tell, and by the 6 month mark I could definitely tell it was working. By then my wife noticed a change and kept mentioning it. BUT, then for another few months after that, it didn&#x27;t seem to be getting that much better from month to month. I didn&#x27;t know if that was unique to me or what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I switched over to my 2nd choice, hairintegro. I keep close track this time of whether or not it was working, and it turned out that after using it for 4 months, my hair regrowth was a little more significant than it was before. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s how it would be for every person or what the reason for that was, but I think it&#x27;s because the oral supplement in hairintegro that goes along with the topical treatment may have just pushed it over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend testing out both to anyone who&#x27;s not sure, but at least I know which one worked a little better for myself.</li>
    <li> This is just glue for hair and who wants to wear glue. It leaves a residue on the scalp and some of it comes off almost as dandruff. Yuck!!!</li>
    <li> I used DualGen-15 and LipoGaine from Minoxidilmax for about one year. I used lipogaine in the morning and DualGen-15 in the evening. Lipogaine absorbs and dry very quickly so it&#x27;s better for morning.  I think the result is much better than what i expected.  My hair is growing faster than normal.  It is a product that could improve the situation and also at a more affordable price than other products.  Buying similar products like Regaine in my city is very expensive and did not really work that well.  On the other hand, I think Lipogaine is a good product.</li>
    <li> So far I really love it. This is a far superior product to rogaine in terms of how your hair looks and feels after you use it. It&#x27;s totally nongreasy. After you use Rogaine you look like you need a shower. I also apply it with a spray which I had bought on my own and I feel it is a much better and even application</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 months now. I can see that my hair is slowly becoming thicker and darker again in my temple areas. I also noticed that there are new hairs growing on my temples that seem to slowly be getting darker and thicker (they are still very small). This product seems to work but it will take time. I started losing my hair when I was 19 I&#x27;m now 24. If most of my hair grows back in half that time I&#x27;ll be a happy customer.  I&#x27;ll update my post again in a few months or sooner if I see any major changes.</li>
    <li> Would give 0 stars if possible. Been using product for about a year. Really greasy and clogs pores. Also caused many sebaceous adenomas and acne in my scalp which I never had before. Lost more hair using this product. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Have used the product for 4 weeks......after showering, my comb still has many hairs pulled out. There is probably a better product?</li>
    <li> Okay so I will say that this product DID start to regrow hair, both noticeably and visibly. After 2 months using it even my family said &amp;#34;Is your hair growing back?&amp;#34; And I could see a big difference in hair that was gone returning. I was really excited...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, little did I know that it would come with a ton of bad side effects. Not only did I start getting irregular heartbeats, but then at times would have trouble breathing. My feet also were swelling up eventually to the point where it was painful. I couldn&#x27;t understand why all these things were happening to me and thought it was stress but when I read the back label all of these symptoms and more were placed as &amp;#34;Stop Taking Immediately If any of these things happen&amp;#34; type of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does it work? Yes. Would I ever use it again? NO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too much risk to my health long term just to grow some hair back... And yes all the regrowth I got was gone in a couple months after stopping using it.</li>
    <li> LEAVES HAIR WAY TO DRY (I have crew cut)  DRY HAIR IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AS THE HAIR NEEEDS NATURAL OILS TO GROW ,  but every 1 else seems happy jus.got.my.botttle.so.will.continue to use and use with castor oil for natural oil and take biotin pills</li>
    <li> A great solution to hair loss. However, you need to be consistent and at least get ready to apply this product for more than a year.</li>
    <li> Amazing results in 4 month</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay ... switched from Rogaine foam to this. Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference as far as hair regrowth goes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product back in October 2013 and loved it. It had a feeling different from general minoxidil, almost a tingling sensation. I got more dandruff initially but I used Nizoral to help with that. The liquid appeared more viscous than minoxidil with solutes. All in all the bottle didn&#x27;t last a month but I was generally satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months later I went to order 2 bottles and one of the bottles came looking completely diluted. I put a little on my scalp and the feeling was not the same. I have come to the conclusion that either Lipogaine could not get a hold of anymore of the azelaic acid that was in here previously or they have been attempting to maximize profits by diluting their compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel cheated and its unfortunate when companies like this pull a fast one. Thankfully amazon refunded my purchase and I went through amazon because with a shady company like this I suspect I would have got the run around.</li>
    <li> I did not see any new hair growth, however, it appears that is has slowed or stopped any additional hair loss.</li>
    <li> Wish it still contained azelaic acid however...it seemed to be more effective with it.  Probably still the best of what is out there though.</li>
    <li> I have to say first that this product is not a &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; product, you won&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;Chris Hemsworth&amp;#34; hair the day after you use it. You need to understand that this product will work but in a long term. If you are bald or starting to get bald, it will gradually increase your hair quantity and you would be able to notice a difference with pictures between the 3rd and the 6th month (in my case it was after the 3rd month).&lt;br /&gt;You just need to apply in the morning before going to work, and in the nights before going to sleep (you&#x27;ll get use to it).&lt;br /&gt;This is not only a cheap solution, but the quality of the product feels good and no one notices that you have it.</li>
    <li> Great product, it works..bonus is that I no longer get dandroff which I used to with other minoxidil liquid brands I have tried in the past. Wish they would do a foam version of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for over two years now. I had been using the most well known hair regrowth product on the market for over a year but I noticed it was no longer working as effectively. I read positive reviews of Lipogaine and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine has become part of my daily routine and it&#x27;s been very effective at stopping my hair loss. I used to shed a lot of hair but now that&#x27;s stopped. I think for some people the application of a liquid might be a bit strange versus a foam, but that&#x27;s a minor adjustment versus the results.</li>
    <li> Works better than Rogaine, that&#x27;s not saying much however. Haven&#x27;t noticed any additional hair loss since I started using this about a year ago. Some spots have filled in, I don&#x27;t expect my hair to go back to how it looked when I was a teenager, but if I cut my hair low now the hair loss is barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> This product never showed any concrete results, and my hair loss continued even during the application regimen.</li>
    <li> It gives me itchiness and dandruff a lot in the morning, it may works for the other not for me.</li>
    <li> After years of studying everything out there to treat my thinning hair I come to the conclusion that Lipogaine is by far the best hair loss product out there! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months in conjunction with Regenepure Dr shampoo and I&#x27;ve seen thicker fuller hair in less than 4 weeks. I&#x27;ve previously used other products (Kirkland) brand etc which was good but takes forever to dry and causes a lot of flakey dandruff due to the alcohol in it. Lipogaine dries fast and does not contain alcohol to dry the scalp out like some of the other brands. When hair dries it has like a hairspray effect where I don&#x27;t even have to put product in it to style most times, it&#x27;s great and not greasy at all. I recommend you give this a go for at least 4 months before you contemplate taking Finasteride or Propecia.</li>
    <li> We received what we expected with this purchase. Appreciate the detailed description. There is nothing unusual to report.  Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> I just bought it a few days before and applied it for two times,the only thing I worry is I feel a little dizzy like half a hour after applying it ,anyone having the same symptom?I&#x27;m not saying it is terrible product,if it can regrow my hair,it worth the discomfort, what I want to ask is Can my hair still get regrown when some side effects like dizziness occur?Do i need to stop?anyone answer me?</li>
    <li> my head itched way too much, but it did seem to help after a couple months. Now after 3 months of discontinuing hair is falling out again. going to try the 5% minoxidil foam instead and will post follow up.  The dermatologist says it should react less with my scalp. Also going to use a recommended dandruff shampoo lilke Nizoral or</li>
    <li> Best product of its type out there.</li>
    <li> I used Kirkland Minoxodil on and off for about 5 years when my hair first started thinning.  I was in a very stressful job, so I would forget to put it on for days at a time, and only do it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I realized that I was really going bald and decided to really make an effort, so I started using a combination of Kirkland and Lipogaine (I have a fair amount of hair left so it takes quite a bit of product to actually get to my scalp, and Lipogaine is expensive!)  I&#x27;ve been using it like that for about 6 months and let me tell you that progress is slooooooowwwwwwwww.  But make sure to stick with it (and take pictures after a similar haircut at the beginning, and every few weeks after that so that you can see what are tiny differences) before you give up.  I understand it&#x27;s only effective for certain people, but if you&#x27;re going to do it, really take a shot.  It has worked for me, I&#x27;d be 40 and almost bald, but I&#x27;ve got a full head of hair instead!</li>
    <li> The truth is if I had not fallen right, maybe I do not notice the change that I wear only once before bedtime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different minoxidil products over the years and have found Lipogaine to work best for me.  The product definitely works if used twice daily as suggested.  The hair growth isn&#x27;t substantial but it&#x27;s a definite improvement, and more importantly has kept me from losing any more hair.  It will stain fabrics (pillow cases, hats, etc) if you&#x27;re not careful so keep that in mind.  I&#x27;ve found it best to apply shortly after showering and drying hair, then removing the excess that&#x27;s not absorbed into the scalp about 20 minutes later by rubbing a towel through my hair.  The cost is comparable to other brands if not a bit cheaper which is another plus.  All in all, this is the product that I&#x27;ll continue to use to help maintain and restore my scalp hair.</li>
    <li> Using just a small amount of this each day in combination with the big 3 shampoo has completely stopped my receding hairline, and has even caused some hair to regrow.</li>
    <li> After trying Rogaine foam for a couple years and then realizing that most of the product gets stuck in my hair and not the scalp where the minoxodil should be, i decided to give lipogaine a try due to the good reviews and the extra ingredients like azealic acid and biotin. I can honestly say it has helped the hair loss on the crown of my head a lot and grown new hairs as well. My case wasnt severe but it is noticable for sure and without lipogaine I for sure would be in a much worse situation. My friends even noticed when I stopped using it for a few months. This product isnt a miracle but it surely is the best minoxodil product out there. Definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This has definitely helped me reduce hairfall. It works well as long as you continue using it. It is one of the better minoxidil treatments out there with some added ingredients to boost effectiveness. Like all Minoxidil products however, it makes your hair brittle &amp; dry when applied (temporary drying &amp; brittle effect - becomes normal when you wash your hair that evening or the next day).</li>
    <li> This combination of products were recommended by this website,( [...] and Id like to send a big \\&quot;Thank you\\&quot; to them. Since I began using this product, my hair is markedly thicker, and it has helped more then anything else Ive tried to  cover my thinning areas. Ive only used it for one month, so I cant comment on new growth yet, but already I am sold on the product, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a little help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.R.D.&lt;br /&gt; Va. Beach, Va.</li>
    <li> I switched to this instead of a generic minoxidil.  I likes the idea of the added supplements.  I use this in combination with dht blocker and nizerol shampoo.  Within a month I am really starting to see some results.</li>
    <li> I stopped using this product when the azelaic acid was removed from the formula about 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The first bottle I used after the azelaic acid was removed from the formula,&lt;br /&gt;I could notice the difference immediately.  My scalp began to itch and my front hairline&lt;br /&gt;became unstable and began to fall out again.  I am very suspicious that large pharmaceutical&lt;br /&gt;companies have negatively influenced lipogaine&#x27;s product because it actually used to work.</li>
    <li> I started using Lipogaine 7 months ago.  I was not seeing any results with Rogaine to be honest.  However, with Lipogaine I do not seem to be having anymore hairloss, some hair has even started growing back.  I would definitely recommend this product over Rogaine.</li>
    <li> There are enough reviews about what it does or does not. I will not complicate it more, or try to be repetitive. I would tell just my part of story why I am staying with Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was on it for some time, but discontinued due to bad scalp condition, was using Ketoconazole shampoo along with this, and daily shampooing made my hair more worse. Took a break and tried other Minoxidil products, but was out of luck. Later, I decided to try this once again after 6 months with a different shampoo \\&quot;[[ASIN:B0032FSDOA Regenepure DR Hair Loss Shampoo For Hair Loss, Scalp Treatment and Dandruff Relief in Men and Women 8.0 fl oz]]\\&quot;, which just works like ketoconazole, but goes smooth and take care of you scalp better. The results were good, shedding has come down and my scalp is much better now(especially no inflammation). But, I want to give a try on \\&quot;[[ASIN:B004N1EQNO Lipogaine Big 3 Hair Loss shampoo (8 oz)]]\\&quot;(will edit the review after using it) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, there are some lessons I learned while looking for best minoxidil in the market.&lt;br /&gt;  - it doesn&#x27;t work the same for all, and there is varied sentiments across the products&lt;br /&gt;  - there is this element of marketing gimmick out there too, ad spam (very hard to find a genuine review/side-effects with all this&lt;br /&gt;  SEO/SEM thing)&lt;br /&gt;  - Google is not the only place to look for, considering the SEO/SEM axe on the head. Try getting info from other search engines&lt;br /&gt;  like YAHOO, BING, ASK,DUCKDUCKGO, AOL etc. The search results vary from each other, if there is a&lt;br /&gt;  genuine article out there, you should find it. You could take one step further and try non-English search engines, like&lt;br /&gt;  BAIDU(from china), YANDEX (from russia). The thing is, we could use google against google, by using google translate, or&lt;br /&gt;  Chrome web browser which translates pages for us to see foreign language pages in desired language. This method could be&lt;br /&gt;  used not only for &#x27;minoxidil&#x27;, but for anything. As a experiment, try &#x27;lipogaine reviews&#x27; or &#x27;lipogaine side effects&#x27; across several&lt;br /&gt;  search engines to evaluate the product.&lt;br /&gt;  - should be smart in evaluating a product, use forums like hairlosstalk, hairlosshelp etc., video reviews, talk to friends with&lt;br /&gt;  same problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all this my overall feeling was, with the products like minoxidil, it is always good to follow the crowd, and be safe as much as possible. I decided to go with crowd and I am good with the results so far. Sometimes have to try product in random to see how it works for you, even if it burns your pocket. Keep an open mind, see where research is heading in the domain, and watch out for new products. So here I am with this review. Hope this helps you.</li>
    <li> Yes, I, 100%, agree with Chris G. I was actually thinking to write a review saying the same. I think they have changed something in the composition that made the initially excellent product (it worked for me excellently in as little time as 3 months) almost a useless. If you observe, most of the early reviews were very positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suspect there may be some fake Lipogaine sellers in the market. After I use the product for about 2 to 3 months (sometime in March 2013), I clearly observed significant new hair growth (better than I expected), even at frontal hairline. Before that time, I had been trying almost every hair regrowth product in the market. I saw some significant hair regrowth with Finesteride but at a cost of some serious sexual side effect which prompted me to stop using it. Lipogaine was the best product for me until couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like Lipogaine is no longer doing its job. By the way, when the product was actually working, I did experience a side effect. My eyes were becoming little blurred after each time I apply Lipogaine to my scalp. Now, no more blurred eyes and of course no more hair regrowth too. In fact, I have lost some previously regrown (by lipogaine itself) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I say good bye to you guys, I would like to share my another relevant observation with either any generic Minoxidil or even with Lipogaine. I guess, these formulations contain some kind of instant hair thickening agents which just stick (coat) to hair shafts and make the hair thicker. This temporary hair thickening effect goes away after subsequent hair wash. I think this temporary thickening effect is what is keeping some fake hair regrowth products in the market (of course at least temporarily :)).</li>
    <li> To be totally honest, this has been one of the only hair loss treatments that has actually worked for me. You can see that I am a REAL person as this account is my Seller account here on Amazon, and I&#x27;m writing this review under this name to rebuff any skeptics that might think I&#x27;m paid or with the company. I am none of either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about the product and my history...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was severely thin on top. Used special DHT shampoos, Rogaine, Spiro Cream, etc.etc. Nothing worked remotely. I didn&#x27;t want to go the route of surgery or Finesteride pills. My treatments in my mind had to be topical or nothing, and if internal it has to be natural. So a month ago I heard about Lipogaine. I ordered some after the reviews here. Was skeptical at first because I thought a minox based product was going to be another failure. Received the bottle and started doing the twice daily applications. I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that I have grown more hair, and the hairs I did have are thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable? Yes. Not fooling myself, not wishful, pure fact. And this is only maybe a little over a month in. (I don&#x27;t now how usual this kind of growth is). Believe me or don&#x27;t, but ask yourself if I would take the time to write this under my seller ID, if I was lying??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 stars because the first 3 weeks or so this stuff made my head itch like crazy. And it&#x27;s kind of sticky. It takes about 15 minutes to dry completely for me. And after each application I feel a little itchy but it gets better over time. BUT, I would gladly put up with 15-20 minutes a day of sticky feeling and tiny amount of tingle, for these results. To balance it out I use this shampoo called \\&quot;Regenepure\\&quot; which is sold on AZtoo. It would be hilarious if THAT was the key to all this. I take the time to massage my scalp fully. And usually after shampooing for about 2 minutes in the morning, at night I don&#x27;t shampoo. But the Regenepure helps with inflammation. I also seem to have a funny taste in my mouth after an application. I have no idea if it&#x27;s my nose being affected or what, but it&#x27;s strange. What&#x27;s the deal with that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the PRICE is too high. It should be HALF the price in my opinion because $25 is a lot for a Minox based solution which is cheap to acquire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have no clue if these results will remain, but being that I&#x27;m only a month in, I can&#x27;t imagine it stopping now. I&#x27;m not claiming this is a cure or total solution but whatever they&#x27;re doing, they&#x27;re onto something. If you&#x27;re curious...my hair pattern was &#x27;diffuse thinning&#x27; on the whole type, not really a &#x27;receding&#x27; type. My growth with this is pretty much all over. I can even see little hairs coming in and the hair I did have is definitely growing. Definitely will be ordering more to see how far this goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post updates with any changes I notice within the next weeks/months.ith inflammation.

    <li> Just read the review by &amp;#34;Crossfield&amp;#34;, I can vouch that my experience is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the first four bottles under the old batch in late 2012 before their tweaked the ingredients, and it worked so wonderfully.  My hairfall stopped, new hair growth observed and hair felt thick.  The best product ever. I ordered the second batch earlier this year (6 bottles this time), and didn&#x27;t realize the missing azelaic acid until a month or two later when the new hair stopped growing. That&#x27;s when I found out they tweaked the ingredients. Emailed them and got the same response with everybody else, which was a canned answer. Hairfall started the rear its ugly head on my last 3 bottles. I was back where I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine is not what it used to be before they changed the ingredients. Maybe azelaic acid, maybe azetinol, maybe FDA but one thing is for sure it doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore.  Now looking for alternatives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in the past. Those left dark circles under my eyes and in fact aged my face a bit.  Lipogaine uses the highest ingrediants and works best. Highly rec.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for a few years now and it really helps to get hair loss under control! But you need to use it every day twice a day as instructed...... Also, in my case anyway, I&#x27;ve noticed that I get even better results being careful about what kind of shampoos I use. The ones which work well for me are the scalp detoxifying ones. Eventually I&#x27;ll find a homemade solution (maybe with aloe vera or cucumbers) to replace store bought shampoos.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine is unquestionably the most effective hair regrowth product that I have ever used.  I have tried nearly every minoxidil product on the market, but none are nearly as effective as Lipogaine.  One of the characteristics that I appreciate most about Lipogaine, is that, one applied, the solution dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my scalp.  This allows me to apply it just prior to work, jump in the car, and by the time I get to the office there isn&#x27;t the slightest indication that it was ever applied.  Lipogaine has helped me significantly reduce the diameter and intensity of my bald spot, which has given me so much confidence.  Thank you Lipogaine!</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for just about 7 months now with great results. I&#x27;ve  previously tried to use Rogaine for about 12 months with some success. After the 3rd month of using Lipogaine my hair started to get much thicker.  I use Lipogaine twice a day and do not see myself ever stopping again. Before using this product I almost excepted the fact that I would never have a head full of hair again but Lipogaine has worked 110% for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product before. Not to sure if it works or not. It may help. But this time the product came in a much clearer color and not in its classic yellow. Seems watered down. Like lightly colored water. The consistancy is also lighter. When I apply it to my scalp there is a quick drip making the diluting more noticeable. I´m not giving it a rating of 1 because I don´t hate the product, just like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the generic brand for years however did not see any improvement on my temples. But when I switched to Lipogaine 6 months ago I am now 100% sure that my temples have started to fill in nicely and becoming thicker and stronger as the time goes on (also I have to mention that I started to use the shampoo in the past 2 months). My hairline is definitely better than it was 6 months ago. I have no plans for dropping this stuff soon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine now for several months, and have been using it consistently. I have noticed that my hair has maintained it&#x27;s current density and the hair loss has also been noticeably less. As long you apply it to towel dried hair, the texture of the hair becomes very similar to what it would feel like with a little bit of product in it. Unlike Rogaine, I did not notice any stains on clothes or pillows, after use/during sleeping. I am very happy with the product and will be a return customer.</li>
    <li> In 2012, I started using various products containing minoxidil to deal with thinning hair. It was most noticeable in the crown area, but also thinning elsewhere. I&#x27;ve used Rogaine Foam, Spectral DNC and Lipogaine. Lipogaine comes out the clear winner of the three. All 3 helped re-grow hair, but only Lipogaine did this without unwanted side-effects: Lipogaine does not smell bad (like Spectral DNC) nor change the texture of your hair in ways that makes styling difficult (like Rogaine Foam).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that&#x27;s starting to use a product containing minoxidil needs to first realize that the process of re-growing hair is long-term. I did not start seeing noticeable results for about 3 months. Again, I emphasize START SEEING RESULTS. You are not going to grow a full head of hair in 3 months - but if you keep at it, the product will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One aspect of my thinning hair I don&#x27;t like is my hairline at the forehead. Although I&#x27;ve read that minoxidil products are not best at working in this area, I have spent several months carefully applying Lipogaine to this area and have seen definite regrowth. Hopefully I will work as well as it has with the rest of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the results. My head of hair is fuller and the hair is strong. I also like the fact Lipogaine (unlike other minoxidil products) does not have a bad smell and does not create problems with styling my hair.</li>
    <li> I do not see the improvement anywhere and we&#x27;ve been putting it on for 2 months. It fell short on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine works very well and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like other products.  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> From all the reviews Ive seen you only talk about hair results but does it work for a patchy beard too ?</li>
    <li> Not sure if this actually does anything.</li>
    <li> The bottle came with a tampered or improperly sealed top. The carrier packaging was perfect. The bottle must have been leaking for an extended period of time because when I opened up the product box, a corner was slightly wrinkled, like when wet paper dries, and the opening and on part of the bottle side had dried, crystallized remnants of the product. I called the manufacturer, and they were of no help. If not for Amazon care, I would&#x27;ve been stuck with paying for a tampered or improperly sealed product that I paid full price for.</li>
    <li> It started dropping more. And it&#x27;s too expensive than other products. I tried because I thought it is expensive so it might work. But it&#x27;s completely waste of your money and time.</li>
    <li> I used to love this product and found it to be highly effective but as the other reviewers have pointed out, I am convinced it has lost its effectiveness after they were forced to remove and replace one of the ingredients.  What a shame because they really had the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; formula.  Now I&#x27;m back to regular Rogaine (in the foam version) and not too sure about it&#x27;s effectiveness either.</li>
    <li> I have used Lipogaine for 9 months now.  I have a decent head of hair, but have noticeably receding hairlines, which is the reason that I purchased Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realizing that everyone is different, I saw results in 4-6 months.  Hairs began appearing in the receding areas (both sides), and I noticed my existing hair getting thicker and growing faster than usual.  I continue to use, knowing that the hair fallout and receding will probably continue if I discontinue the use.  It&#x27;s the nature of the cycle that was occurring with me, and anyone else who is losing hair.  It gets worse without assistance, not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is priced high, which is why I only give it 4 stars, since price value is one of my criteria for evaluating any product.  They need to find a way to reduce their operational costs and lower the price.  I purchase by using my Discovercard bonus dollars;  otherwise, I would have to purchase much more sparingly.  As it is, I only use 1 ml at night, and do not do the 2 applications / day suggested.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and an very pleased with the product!!  There is no odor and with the application tip its very easy to apply.  I feel the product is helping my thinning hairline, and I will continue to use this solution as long as needed!!  The seller has always shipped the product very fast and I am beyond pleased!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a year and it has been a key in restoring my thinning and loss of hair. It took my hair a long time to regrow (results vary for other people), but my hair has regrown and I went to a haircut shop a few months back and the lady wanted to use &amp;#34;Thinning Scissors&amp;#34; on my hair and I told her &amp;#34;No!&amp;#34; - Was a great feeling and still is a great feeling to have a piece of my dignity back.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review for my fiance who used the product for one bottle. After one month he saw some peach fuzz growing. Nothing to be overly happy about, because he believes he lost more hair than grew in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, he didn&#x27;t put the product on for three days and it went all down hill. He hadn&#x27;t reacted badly at all to the product until he stopped using it and it was BAD. His whole head turned red and was itchy. That wasn&#x27;t even the worse part. It made his ears bright red and gave him a burning sensation. This reaction lasted for over a week. There was nothing he could do to help with the burning (anything and everything made it worse), he had to simply let the solution leave his body. It left him miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is not the only one who has had this reaction (I searched reviews and online). Not everyone will experience this, but just a warning that it might happen to you too.</li>
    <li> There does not exist a magical solution that will immediately start growing thick hair on your head. So I wouldn&#x27;t read too much into reviews saying how this stuff doesn&#x27;t work after just a few weeks or 1-2 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different products in the past, but after a long time of researching and trial-and-error-ing, I stuck to this product. AND IT WORKED FOR ME. This is one of the best products out there according to many different sources. After using it for several months very diligently (once in the morning before going to work, once at night before bed), I have seen a drastic improvement around my front hairline and crown. You have to be very diligent, and patient with battling hair-loss. No product is gonna give you instant results. But if there are so many good customer reviews and results posted all over the web about Lipogaine, maybe it&#x27;s worth a shot for you too. $25 a bottle may sound expensive, but the bottle lasts a month, which is basically a dollar per day for your precious hair. If you care enough about hair loss to be reading my review right now, a $1 per day is really not that much to ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: a few days ago, Lipogaine sent me a surprise package with a complimentary, month supply of bottle, with a personalized message on printed paper. Great product, company and customer service. They really care about their product, improving it, and want you to get good results from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless what you do or what you take, maintaining good health, diet and a good care of your body and life is probably the most important above anything else. Once those basic things are all checked off, good products like Lipogaine will definitely bring good results.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for men for approx. 1 year now.  While I have not seen much of an increase in hair growth, I would definitely say that I have not seen a decrease, which is, really, what I am trying to accomplish.  This product will yield different results for all individuals, so my experience may not be yours, however, I have been happy with the status quo, as hair loss essentially runs in my family, so keeping what I have is great!</li>
    <li> My scalp is constantly dry even after using shampoo for thinning hair and it is constantly irritated until I started using this product.  It stung initially as my scalp was really dry but after a while, it gave me a soothing feeling every time I apply it to my scalp after showering.  My spouse noticed that my hair appears fuller in some places this product is definitely doing something right.</li>
    <li> So i wanted to write this review to say This stuff works great!!!!  I have tried alot of others from 2010 to2014 which kept what i have up till when i saw lipogaine which had alot of great reviews so i figured i give it a try and the first month i notice spiky small hairs coming threw, Than in the 3rd month they was coming out all over my head.  Im on around my 7th bottle and i uploaded 2 pics from December 1st till now.  one bottle was lasting me like 40days at the start cause i had less hair. But sense i have more hair now it lasts me around 30days.  Pretty much lets just say nothing comes close to lipogaine. And for any new people wanting to try it you have to give it time and not quit after the first or 2nd month You have to stay with it for at least 6months.  Pretty much lets just say nothing comes close to lipogaine.  And for any new people wanting to try it you have to give it time and not quit after the first or 2nd month You have to stay with it for at least 6months and don&#x27;t be scared seeing shedding because i had it the first months you will see it and when that happens it means its working because its getting rid of the dead hair to make room for the new.  But this stuff is worth it to give it a try.  It working for me as you can see by my 2 photos:) still have more to go tho but i know its working:)  Some will see faster results than others i say im around the middle? But so far i been very happy with the product:)  Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> great product! I have used different minoxidil brands over the last couple of years, and Lipogaine is the best. It has the best effect on my hair and makes my hair to look more.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market today. I&#x27;ve been using for 7 months now and I have significant hair growth in areas I haven&#x27;t had since I was a younger. I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair is more fuller then it was before I started using this product.</li>
    <li> After two months of using this product...i was really amazed at the difference.  it definitely works...i use this in conjuction with emu oil and my hair loss has completely stopped.  I initially was losing about 40-50 hairs...I was on doctor prescribed medication as well.  so i am not sure whether it is medication induced shedding.  ...actually, my shedding stopped 2 weeks ago and i have been using this for 2 months already.  but within the 2 weeks, i have seen drastic improvements.  i can&#x27;t wait for it to fully mature</li>
    <li> Using this product for almost 1 year, I can definitely say it slowed down my hair loss and i&#x27;m starting to see new hair growing back. It dries very quickly and there&#x27;s no scent. There was little bit itching when I started using Lipogaine but it went away after that.</li>
    <li> I tried minoxidil years ago, and I don&#x27;t know why I stopped. I suppose I was expecting something more instantaneous. This time I used Lipogaine meticulously. I&#x27;m at my forth month and yes, it works. No doubt. I can actually easily predict that in 2 o 3 extra months I will have more hair than in my 20&#x27;s. Keep using it and buy yourself some biotine too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on now for maybe 2 years.. I cannot say with 100% certainty that it helps grow back lost hair, but I think it is a great solution to maintaining the hair you currently have... If you catch your hair loss at an early stage, I recommend using this to prevent further hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product, by far lipogaine gave me the best result, I combined it with biotin vitamins, it works both hairline and crown and I must say it works great for me, my front line started to thin a little but using lipogaine it was the first place I seen growth and I no longer have any hair in my comb. Give it a try you would not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m saying 3 stars because I only been using it for 3 week.  Seems like something is going on. I use this with the mm shampoo.  you only need to put it on the balding spots twice a day. I use it for my hair line.  The left side of my hair line seem much better. You really have to look up close to see were the thinning hair spot was so so far good!  will keep you posted</li>
    <li> This si a good quality product and reasonably effective as far as I am concerned. Also amongst the best value for money</li>
    <li> Well, the product I purchased more than a month ago was thicker, stickier, more yellowish in color (could it be oxidation over time?!), and had a more potent drying effect that I used to notice on my forehead and scalp. I purchased Lipogaine for the second time about a week ago, and it seems different than the one I got before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have concerns about other reviewers mentioning Azelaic Acid being removed from the formula a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have no other choice but to question the higher price tag compared to other cheaper generic Mioxidil products out their.</li>
    <li> Switched from 10% minoxidil to Lipogaine. Previous one gave loads of dandruff, scalp irritation and finally recalled from market. After days of research, Lipogaine solution looked best. I settled on Lipogaine primarily for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5% minoxidil - Higher concentrations are not proved safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azelaic Acid - DHT blocker is my primary concern. I am not sure when I can see new growth of hairs but azelaic acid immediately stops current hair loss and help retains natural hairs. Sooner you start using DHT blocker, better volume of hair you can maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol - Dont like stinking foam or any other way for minoxidil. Retinol is best base to get minoxidil in odorless 1 ml of liquid drop. Now you can use minoxidil every day and still keep it unnoticeable in your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin - I never saw biotin in previous minoxidil solutions I used. My dermatotologist once prescribed me biotin capsules to prevent hair loss. Happy to have it included in my minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw palmetto - Even this I never had in other minoxidil solutions. Heard that saw palmetto is natural herbal to block DHT. Thanks to Lipogaine to include this as well in same bottle of minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use, my hair loss is very minimal. Prevention is better than cure, I prevented further hair loss and ensured rate of hair loss is less than or atleast equal to rate of new hair growth. Minoxidil will continue its work and reduce the possibility of having a bald patch in coming years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend Lipogaine minoxidil for men. Minoxidil is same minoxidil in every brand. But with lipogaine, you get best combo of DHT blockers to reduce loss of your existing hairs, contains effective nutrition (vitamins) to nourish hair, with retinol which is best and cleanest way to absorb minoxidil and finally with a company you can trust to have good quality control.</li>
    <li> I must give this item the props it deserves. I have been using Lipogaoine for 4 months and have seen great results. My thinning hair at the crown has significantly gotten thicker. Will continue to use this product and recommend it to anyone wanting to improve thinning hair. Apply twice daily and you can expect results within 5-8 weeks. Product  is nearly untraceable. No smell, no color. Easy to apply with the dropper provided. I am a big fan of lipogaine and almost didnt give it a try. I was discouraged after using rogaine for 6 months and noticing little to almost no results. Lipo is great.</li>
    <li> I start losing my hair early 20s and I&#x27;m 30 now and i have never used any treatment just because i do believe that there is no solution. Anyway, I decided to go a head and buy this product - which have good reviews - because my friend encourage me to use minoxidil as his friend start to have hair regrowth. I choosed Lipogaine because the other ingrediants that include and other products don&#x27;t have it like rogaine besides rogaine clearly said that is only work on the vertex. my complaint about the side affects that i start to have after using it for three weeks SKIN DAMAGE AND EYE SWELLING. i&#x27;d rather staying bald than have an older face than my real age. welcome to the balding group again. good luck for you guys.</li>
    <li> I stopped using Lipogane because i was losing more hair with this product than whit out it. I did not see any side effects but for me did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt; I continue to use Lipogaine and I read online that this was normal.&lt;br /&gt;I am not losing the same amount of hair like before, actually is working really good, my hair is getting thicker and is growing faster, but is to soon to say, i will post any changes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product works well, the quality of my hair looked a lot better. mostly stopped my shedding and notice my hair looked like it was getting thicker. I recommend it over regular minoxidil.</li>
    <li> Did not work, I tried it for 4 months and no results, Regaine is much better as far as results go</li>
    <li> so i have used this product for about three months. maybe it should be at least 6 months? not so sure. anywho! i myself did not or could not tell if i had any regrowth in general. my hair sure didn&#x27;t seem like it got thicker. i don&#x27;t lose batches of hair in the shower or in general but i have very fine, thinning hair and i&#x27;m just not regrowing back what i am losing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i gave this product 3 stars bc it did make my hair look thicker when i would apply it and blowdry it. but i think that was only bc it would tangle my hair so much and become so dry that it just created a nest affect. i didn&#x27;t get dandruff or had any side effects like some others did but i do know i started regrowing hair on my face in general which was annoying bc i want it on my freaking head! not my chin! it almost seemed like those hair styling foams that thicken your hair once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anywho, i think the worst thing about this formula is that it does indeed leave a horrible ashy dust on your hair when it dries and you comb through your hair. that was a pain bc it looked like i had gray patches of hair bc of the formula. i would try to spray those areas with a little water, in hopes it would disappear but it didn&#x27;t really. sometimes hair spray would lessen the ash but not so much. the only reason i haven&#x27;t reordered is bc i have some other products i haven&#x27;t used that i want to get through first and bc this is definitely pricier than anything else i&#x27;ve tried. i&#x27;m still debating if i want to reorder and give myself a long long trial with the product. the dryness sucked but at least it did make my hair look a little thicker right after i put it on. i noticed too i starting getting a lot of white hairs after using this product. at an annoying rate. i wonder if maybe those were new hairs that were growing in but for some reason just didn&#x27;t have any color? not sure.</li>
    <li> use lipogaine twice a day and shampoo using BIG 3 shampoo they provide.  for sure your hair loss will stop.  I will report further  been using it for two months and one week.  Used to have my hands full of hair in the shower.  now only a few.  very little hair in my brush and very little hair on my pillow.  my hair is coming back from crown all the way to the front line of my hair line.  if you are a young guy this is your solution.  much better and probably more effective than rogaine alone or propecia.  good luck.</li>
    <li> This stuff seriously works!!! I did a lot of research on hair products and this one was the best! It can leave you a bit itchy which is the only downside but the results are great. Not only did i stop losing alot of hair but even some regrowth was happening.</li>
    <li> Since I have started using Lipogaine 5 months ago I have noticed my hair is fuller and healthier looking.  I am taking it in con-junction with biotin pills and Finasteride prescription so I am not sure which of the products is making it all happen but its happening so I am sticking with Lipogaine.  Also, I used to use minoxidil from Costco and it felt so nasty on my hair.  Lipogaine doesnt feel sticky and nasty, it actually helps with the styling a bit!  I am satisfied and would recommend the product to others trying to give their hair a new boost and most importantly, keeping what you have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for over a year now and have had considerable success in reversing hair loss not only on the crown but also the temples.  I experienced an increase in hair shedding for about a month.  I noticed about 10 more hairs in each hand when washing my hair in the shower. Once the increased shedding ceased I noticed at 2 months I was losing very little hair when washing in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At month 3 is when I noticed an increase in the density of hair on my crown and at month 4 I noticed my temples had re-grown hair. After over a year use my crown has completely regrown all the hair I had when I was a teenager and my temples have re-grown about a half inch of hair.  My hair is now the way it was before I started getting male pattern baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine&#x27;s formula is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried on the market and will continue to use it indefinitely. Don&#x27;t be discouraged as it can take several months for the results to really kick in. Highly recommend to anyone losing hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for a while now about 7 months and I have to say, I didnot notice any regrowth in the hair I am not talking about the little peach fuzz on your hairline that&#x27;s pointless. I have been using it everyday with a 1.5 MM microneedle but haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference in my hair regrowth. I just remembered this I was told that this product is awesome and my hair regrowth would be outstanding, I will track down this guy and kick him in the back</li>
    <li> I use this treatment in combination with the Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo. Once in awhile, before applying the product I use a microneedle (1mm or smaller is recommended) to open up the pores of the areas where balding is occurring and the product is absorb and all the effects are multiplied. I have seen some results when doing this. At times I feel like results are progressing slowly, but in my condition any result is better than no result. Also it is preventing me from losing more hair than I already loss so to me it is a big plus. I have bought 3 months supply and I am seeing little hairs where there was no hair before. On my one year anniversary of using this product I will post another review to my results.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get your hopes up. I tried it for 6 months, spent  $150.00 and not a sprout nor a fuzz to be seen. No hair in the drain though, however, I had no hair in the drain with Kirkland 5% Minoxidil and $25.00 for a six month supply. This was an expensive experiment and it failed to produce any growth.</li>
    <li> Seems to work for me.</li>
    <li> This product is a gift from the gods. I &#x27;ve been using for only 1 month and I can already see regrowth. Its the fuzzy kind, but that&#x27;s what you get in the beginning when  your hair starts to regrow. I shave my head so I don&#x27;t have to worry about this product being a little sticky. So far its working for me so I can&#x27;t wait to see what 1 year of use will do</li>
    <li> it caused itches in my hair, i bought rogain and very happy with this&lt;br /&gt;i bought two bottles lipogain and progress was unsatisfactory</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 2years now. Working for me!</li>
    <li> The product seems to be working fine, I had no adverse reactions of any kind. It takes a while to see some changes, but the main point is to keep on schedule with the daily applications. Does not leave any &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; on my hair as other cheaper brands do.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for 3 yrs now and I have the best results ive ever had. Its a great product drys quick and best of all real results. In my opinion I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have tried this for five months. No results in the positiva side. I dont recommend it. Hair transplant is my next choice.</li>
    <li> twice a day for 8 months and nothing.  found regenepure dr and nt to be more effective without this.  read that you shouldn&#x27;t use regenepure every day and also read that you can use it every day without any problems.  i use it every day and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
    <li> As I have written before this product keeps working for me.&lt;br /&gt;Nice slim container, easy to slip in a travel bag.I started using it&lt;br /&gt;about 1 and a half years ago.For the first 6months I applied&lt;br /&gt;it twice a day.Currently I apply it once a day, most days.More specifically&lt;br /&gt;I apply it 2 times a day 2 days a week.I personally have zero side effects&lt;br /&gt;that I am aware of.I do feel comfortable with this product.</li>
    <li> I got an allergic reaction from using it the first week or so. Swelling, and severe itching. I can&#x27;t say weather it works or not because I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my grandson who is only 20 years old and has significant male pattern baldness.  He has been using it for almost a year and it seems to have slowed the hair loss--hard to tell for sure.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a year with decent results, then they changed the formula.  For the next six months (using the new formula) I lost much of the hair that I had gained, leading me to believe that the new formula is inferior in some way.  This is simply my opinion as a 14 year Minoxidil user.  I have since begun using a basic 5% formula from Kirklands, and putting my own Azelaic Acid Flakes into the mixture.  I also use a ketoconazole shampoo.  I have already begun to see some areas thickening back up, and it is MUCH cheaper.</li>
    <li> The application is very easy, and straight forward. Just apply the product using the applicator. I usually run a straight line of the product on the area needed and then run my fingers through, making sure the product is spread evenly on the scalp. I haven&#x27;t had any problems and I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now, no dry scalp, dandruff or itchy scalp. I apply twice a day, just make sure your scalp is somewhat dry that way the product can settle in. I started using it to keep the hair I have on my head, lol. But I have to admit, it even started regrowing hair on my hairline, which is great because I never noticed my slightly receding hairline till I saw baby hairs popping up! Let&#x27;s face it, as we get older we WILL start losing our hair, but using this product will help keep, maintain and regrow our hair. As long as you stick and upkeep this regimen, you will have no problems with hair loss. Hope this is helpful!</li>
    <li> Lipogaine works and I&#x27;ve used this product for well over a year. It has effectively stopped my hair loss. Initially, I used it twice a day (once morning and once before bed); now, I maintain my current hair with a once-a-night application. I recommend pairing this product with some form of anti-DHT shampoo for even stronger effects.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband in hopes it would work.  He had been trying Rogaine - but without much success.  With Lipogaine, he feels he is definitely keeping the hair he has and believes his hair looks fuller and thicker on top. He has been using this product for over a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 4 or 5th one and it still has not done anything. My hair got even worse and i thought this would work for me like other stated. I quit and will not be buying another. It sucks because it was so expensive. I used it for so long and just nothing happened, just more increased hair loss. be warned.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for more than a year and I can honestly say that it works. Before using this, I had so much falling hair that I would normally see in the tub. It doesn&#x27;t really make your hair thicker but it does prevent hair from falling off -- so it protects what hair you have left, at least in my case. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective and low-cost hair loss treatment.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for 2 years and have seen AMAZING results, i will use Lipogaine forever!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for the past 4 years and I absolutely love it. It has reduced my hair fall manyfold. I use it in combination with Biotin tablet supplements and a Ketoconazole shampoo. I won&#x27;t say that my hair fall has completely stopped, but it has gone done a lot. I recommend it to everybody in my family and friends circle. Too bad they don&#x27;t sell internally (India) as my brother there would have benefitted from it. Thanks Lipogaine!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great it helped with my hair loss problems I highly recommend it to anyone who is having problems with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I think this product cause face buffiness more than the regular rogaine. Ingredients listed are good tho , not sure houw it could&#x27;ve been better tho</li>
    <li> I started to experience some rapid hair loss after a severe illness, which caused me to finally look for a hair loss treatment. I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for about 1.5 months now, and have really noticed a difference! It took about 3 weeks for me to stop seeing hair loss, but at the same time, I noticed new, albeit light and thin, hair start to emerge along my hairline above my forehead. I actually think I have hair growing in places up there that I haven&#x27;t had since college 10+ years ago. I am definitely not back to the density I once had, but I am still only 1.5 months in. I just ordered 3 more bottles so I can continue with it and hopefully see more gains! I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review after a few months</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband and he likes it. We have noticed that the hair loss hast stopped. It has been almost 6 months and seems like the hair is growing very slowly. So far this is the best product he has tried. He tried Monoxidil alone and it did not work. Once he stopped the hair was falling even faster. With Lipogaine it has not been the case. We are pleased with it even though it is slowly working. This product has vital nutrients for hair follicles that helps regrow the hair.  He even uses it for styling his hair. We recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Used it for more than three months. I believe that quality costs money. So, I didn&#x27;t care about the price when I bough it. I regret it. It simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I started to lose my hair around the age of 20. I did a lot of research online until I found a product that I could trust and had very good testimonies from its customers. In my research I bumped into a YouTube channel that discussed hair loss and that is where I was introduced to Lipogaine. After reading and hearing what others had to say I decided this would be the first product I would try and I am sure glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After consistent use I started to see some regrowth around month 3 and by the 6 month my hair was noticeably thicker and my hairline was getting way better. I have also recommended this product to a few family members and the few that decided to try have had good results. Some even better than mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very easy to apply, Doesn&#x27;t have any sort of odor, and for me or anyone I know does not cause any type of discomfort. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using Lipogaine because of the results I&#x27;ve had with it.</li>
    <li> I am an 80-year old man in excellent health with all of my original teeth but was losing my hair at age 60 and started using using Rogaine .  Rogaine slowed down hair loss but I never any evidence of new hair growth except for &amp;#34;peach fuzz.&amp;#34;  I finally realized that I was in denial and changed over to Lipograine 3 months ago.  I was surprised that it left my hair stiff after applying, however, I was able to style what I had a litter easier.  After massaging it twice a day for 3 months, I notice that my hair is darker with new growth at the temple and vortex.  My barber commented on the change and asked me what I was using.  People ask me if I am dying my hair which I am not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 80 but still interested in my appearance so I will continue using Lipogaine and hopefully, the price will eventually go down.  I also am using the Laser Comb.</li>
    <li> This is very productive. I&#x27;ve seen results and will continue to use their products.</li>
    <li> Been using Lipogaine for a few months now, shedding has certainly slowed down. I can&#x27;t say for sure what the full results will be but I would recommend trying it out if you&#x27;re thinking about it.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It works better than Rogaine, in my experience, and it&#x27;s not quite as irritating to the scalp. That being said, I only gave it four stars because it still can make your scalp feel pretty itchy with extended use. I try to take a break every few days. All in all, four stars for being the best topical out there right now, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet such as hair growth, but we update the review if I start to see anything.</li>
    <li> I order Lipogaine for my husband. He swears by it. His hair really is much fuller since he&#x27;s been using it. He tried other products with out any results and some left a weird coating on his scalp. But Lipogaine never does it works well and it&#x27;s not expensive and one bottle lasts or a month. The order comes quickly and I&#x27;ve never had a problem.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy this even after reading the great reviews because you never know how these products will work with different kinds of hair. But let me tell you: I&#x27;m African American and it worked great! I was losing at the temples and on the sides but now it&#x27;s all back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a little more than a year. Unlike others I didn&#x27;t see significant regrowth in 2 or 3 months. It was about a full six months before I knew it was working. But now it&#x27;s all back and when I tell people I use hair loss treatment they look up at my full hair and then look at me like I&#x27;m crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip: when you are using it, try not to line your hair up at the barbershop because sometimes barbers will shave away new growth before you even realize it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be easy with how much you put on. When you apply a lot, it becomes white when it dries and that&#x27;s especially noticeable when you have dark skin.</li>
    <li> This product works great to control hair loss.  I started getting thinning hair about 2 years ago and no other hair product has done the work like Lipogaine.  You&#x27;ll start seeing the difference gradually, don&#x27;t expect to see results over night.  I have started applying the product on dry hair  every night for the las 7 months and now I can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is important, use the product regularly for best result.  Compare before and after pictures every month to see the progress...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 18 months.  It definitely regrows hair without a doubt but expect it to take 3-4 months before you see results.  Be patient and use it twice a day everyday, otherwise you won&#x27;t get the results you&#x27;re paying for.  I was losing my hair in my early twenties and was able to keep some after a few years of Rogaine but after switching to Lipogaine my bald spot is almost completely gone.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It not only helps regrow the hair as it promises but also clears the dandruff. I apply at night and leave it overnight..I have tried several non-priscrption product and i can say with authority that this is the best by-far. The only problem is the price. I hope they come down on the price little bit; it would help extensively.</li>
    <li> It has changed my life !! I waited to see results to write a review . My hair was so thin and falling out. This product has thicken my hair and has stopped the fall out , have repurchased it 3 times .</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order of a month supply. So far so good. My hair stopped from shedding everywhere. Its a start 😕</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite product among the rest and i have tried many. Until new discoveries on hair regrowth I&#x27;m sticking with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months after al the stellar reviews. I did not want to believe it but I have finally pinpointed my terrible acne break to this product. First let me say that after 6 months I have not seen any noticeable change at all. That&#x27;s not the reason that I stopped using the product. I stopped using the product because everytime I would sweat - my sweat would give me a stinging burning sensation on my forehead. I would sweat a lot and will feel this god awful feeling, and I did not know where it was coming from. That&#x27;s not the worst part... I started getting these huge pimples that turned into lesions. I&#x27;m talking about nuclear size and just down awful, destroying my skin.  Can it be that I&#x27;m just allergic to a particular ingredient in this product? I don&#x27;t know. My forehead feels fried, I have terrible acne, oh yeah... my ears where also burning red for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, this is what happened to me. Can it work for you? Maybe. Do you want to take a gamble with how your skin and face will look from using this product?  I wish I would have read more of the negative reviews when I first purchased this product and not just the stellar ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be taken off the market... that&#x27;s how strong I feel about it after my personal experiences. Maybe I&#x27;m just a special flower who is allergic to such product, but believe me, I never had anything like this happened to me before, and I&amp;#34;m not really prone to strong allergies. Anyways, heed my warning and decide for yourself.  All the best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Expensive. Dries quicker than regular minoxidil. But, dries very crusty and stiff on your head and hair. Think Something About Mary.  Wasnt worth the drying quicker for me.</li>
    <li> It is not working and just like other minoxidil products. hair loss increased and no hair growth. waste of money</li>
    <li> Didn’t work for me!!! Severe skin rash, my suggestion is have a talk with a physician before use.  I used the product for two weeks which caused a brutal skin rash, I had to go to the hospital and my physician advised me to stay away from the product. I guess this was not made for me.</li>
    <li> This product is very expensive. I only purchased one bottle and never bought it again. I am going to look for other alternatives out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for three weeks and am very happy with the results this far.</li>
    <li> I am in my ffities and have been using this product for the last several years.  It is the best one currently on the market.  It definitely has held my hair loss at bay for those last several years.  When I first used Lipogaine, I got quite a bit of new hair that first came in as fine hairs, but thickened over the next several months  Lipogain has allowed me to maintain that new growth to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brothers serve as a kind of control for whether Lipogaine is working.  Every time I see them, I am suprised by how much their hair loss seems to have progressed.  They ocassionally ask me why I don&#x27;t seem to being blading like them.  I tell them to give Lipogaine a try, but so far I dont think any of them have pulled the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I had tried both Minidoxil and Propecia.  Propecia didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me on the hair growth front.  But, it did give me a bunch of nasty side effects.  Not the right product for me.  Regular 5% minidoxil worked ok for me, but defintiely not as much regrowth or thickness on new hair.  There was a product that was over 5% minoxidil on the market, which worked well, but the FDA shut it down due to concerns about potential side effects.  For me, Lipogaine work at least as well as that banned product and I have not had any negative side effects with Lipogaine.  The banned product did seem to cause some odd, transient blood pressure drops (dizziness).</li>
    <li> This works. I had a thinning crown and tried this along with Finasteride. That was about 3 years ago. I did not like the side effects of the Finasteride at all, so I stopped it, cold turkey. It&#x27;s been a year now and my crown is still completely full. Obviously, the Finasteride was not doing anything at all and the regrowth of hair was 100% due to Lipogaine. They&#x27;ve gained a faithful customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months. Around month 3 I noticed a big difference especially around the crown of my head. There has been a slight improvement to my front hairline. Haven&#x27;t noticed any more significant changes since month 3 but maintaining the hair growth.  Will definitely continue to use this product.  It&#x27;s worth noting that I also use a derma roller in conjunction with this product. I used to use Spectral DNC before but did not have as good of a result.</li>
    <li> This is now my 5th bottle of Lipogaine and I love it.  I had used the other main competitors product for a few years and felt like they kept changing the formula and it wasn&#x27;t as effective anymore. This goes on easily and is not sticky at all.  Let it dry and style hair as usual.  I liked this product so much that I started buying the Lipogaine Shampoo and love that product as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for about 4 months and my hair has stopped thinning out, and can even see some new growth, I&#x27;m going to go on for 6 months to see what type of results I receive. This solution drys really quick which is a good thing and really affordable.</li>
    <li> i already used the lipogaine that made me happy with the resuts and now wanna&#x27; continue to treatment but can not order this item to Turkey. Please help me :(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he was shedding hairs quite quickly. He used this product for about 2 months, and it didn&#x27;t really make him grow more hair, but it did seem to reduce his shedding problem so that he wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair as he was before. But, this could also be due to the fact that he was less stressed and eating better, so it is hard to say what factor really changed his hair. I&#x27;m more inclined to think that it was a combination of these things that helped improve his hair and not one thing alone. But, I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair loss product I have tried. I really wanted this to work, but unfortunately my body has rejected something in this solution. After a month of use, what I initially wrote off as just shedding and itchyness has also turned into an irritated red rash around my crown, dry &amp; flaking skin and oddly inflamed/red ears. I am going to go ahead and assume this is not normal and I should cease using the product. I did however also buy their shampoo and I like it, wished this worked for me too! Has anyone had the same problems?</li>
    <li> First of I would like to say I have always been skeptical when it comes to products that claim they can either stop hairloss or regrow your hair.  I first tried this product in July of 2013 twice a day once in the morning when I wake up and once at night about an hour or so before I go to sleep since the product dries in about 15 min and theres no residue left on my pillow.  For the first few weeks my hair loss increased which made me nervous but I do understand that it is making room for the new hair to grow. after a couple of months my hair loss slowed down significantly and a few months after that the vortex part of my head started to get darker if I let my hair grow out which I usually don&#x27;t do.  I also applied the product on my hairline. I seen a little peach fuzz hair grow in the areas that need it and it has also stopped the receding portion so I am happy with those results.  I suggest at the first notice of fall out try out the product and it will at least save what you have left and it can even regrow some hair as long as your follicles have not died out.  Overall I give this product a solid &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; and I will continue to use it since I personally have seen great results.</li>
    <li> the best product I had ever used. It works when I used on bottle for a month. My hair in forehead began to turn thinker and darker. I can feel by hand that there was some short hair regrow on my top scalp.</li>
    <li> Having used Minoxidil (brand name) for over a year, I was getting an itchy scalp and dandruff like build up. I read the rave reviews about Lipogaine and decided to give it a shot. I have been using it for the past 9 months or so by alternating with Minoxidil and I can say that the hair loss has been stabilized. I don&#x27;t think I have seen a very visible re-growth yet but I am happy with the hair loss stop. Also, I guess due to extra ingredients, I am not getting an itchy scalp which is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I feel that this product is less greasy than regular Minoxidil and dries faster. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I started using this in mid January and haven&#x27;t really noticed too much hair regrowth yet, but I haven&#x27;t lost anymore hair either.</li>
    <li> Cleanses the scalp very nicely, my flaky scalp disappeared in 1 week.  After 1 month I noticed my hair stopped sheading as much. I would definitely recommend this product for hair loss and flaky scalp.</li>
    <li> I researched several brands and I chose this one from all the great reviews it has received. I have been using this product for 6 moths and I can say I saw results in my first month. My hair stopped falling out as much and even almost completely stopped by my 3rd month. I have seen defiantly improvement of my regrowth of hair and I can say for certain this really works! I highly recommend this for Men with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This product takes a few months before it starts working. It took close to 6 months before I started noticing any results. My hair is now getting thicker and stronger and continues to do so while using the product. Do not stop using if you do not see results right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for about 6 months now and I have definitely noticed a slow in the rate my hair has been thinning. As for new hair growth, I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of that. My thin hair is still the same as when I first started using the product which could be a con for some consumers but I look at it as a plus. I don&#x27;t expect to ever find a magical cure for my hair to grow and become thicker than ever; I&#x27;m just looking for a product to slow my hair loss until I feel I am a reasonable age to be bald (I&#x27;m currently 22). If you&#x27;re looking for a product to slow your thinning hair this might be worth a shot. Just make sure to use it properly, and make sure it dries before you fall asleep, it is a terrible experience to get in your eyes. In the mean time, if you want to make your hair cosmetically look fuller in a flash try Toppik Hair Building Fibers. That product hides my thinning crown in a flash. In combination with Lipogaine I feel I still have hope. Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and unlike Rogaine foam I didn&#x27;t see any hair shedding. It especially works well in frontal hair loos where I see a significant improvement in my hair line. I also use it on my eye brows where I see some slow thicken growth.  What I like most of about this product is that I don&#x27;t see any further hair loss. I use it in combination with Nizoral shampoo and a daily multivitamin. It works.</li>
    <li> Have been using once before bed on front crown area where hairline was receding. Has actually helped the area become fuller and hair thicker so I&#x27;ll continue using it. best thing I&#x27;ve found since the higher level minoxidil products were taken off the market.</li>
    <li> My husband was using the Bosley system for a year with no regrowth. He began using Lipogaine Aug 22, 2013 twice daily in conjunction with a .5mm micro needle roller before each application and shampooing once daily with Surface Awaken therapeutic shampoo. After 2.5 months he has tons of new growth around the front hairline and within his hair. His hair is also growing VERY fast.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about two years ago due to the positive customer reviews, and I have been very happy with the results. Before I began, my hair was thinning rapidly, but since I started using Lipogaine twice daily, I stopped loosing my hair and some of it has grown back. The combination of minoxidil and DHT blockers really works!</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me. My hair started  thinning around six years ago. After done some research on internet , finally I found the product that really worked to cure my hair which is Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Lipogaine around April 2013. At first I was using it twice a day. After a couple months I saw some baby hairs start to grow on my temple side.&lt;br /&gt;Really a recommended product!</li>
    <li> Just finished my fifth bottle.  There has been some regrowth, but I don&#x27;t have the typical top-of-head bald spot that they say it works best with.  I have thinning down the middle, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well for that type of balding.  I am using a hair-loss DHT blocking shampoo in conjunction with it.  As others have said, it can get a little crusty, especially the second application after washing your hair (it&#x27;s not good to wash your hair more than once per day).  However, it does dry faster than regular minoxidil.  I guess that&#x27;s the tradeoff.  But I&#x27;d rather have my hair a little crustier (can always say it is hair gel) than have to get up 30 minutes earlier in the morning to allow more drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: it is a little yellow/orange in color, so make sure you apply it an hour before going to bed to give it time to dry.  Or switch to beige/tan or black colored pillowcases.</li>
    <li> My son orders this product Lipogane for Men. He has taken before and after pictures and the product really does work. His self esteem has returned as well as the hair that he had loss. He continues the product as a form of maintanence.</li>
    <li> I started using this product along with Lipogaine&#x27;s shampoo and Kirkland&#x27;s Minoxidil 5% about 2 months ago after reading this guy&#x27;s seemingly successful routine for hair loss treatment  ([...]). I try to be consistent in my usage but it&#x27;s not always easy. Most days of the week I apply both the Lipogaine and Kirkland Minoxidil once each. Which one is applied at what time just depends on the day really. Bottom line is I try to wait anywhere from 10 to 16 hours between applications. I just ordered my third bottle of Lipogaine after running out so I&#x27;ll be strictly on the minoxidil for a couple days.    My hair loss is evident to anyone who glances at me. My hair line recedes pretty far and my temple is balding the worst, but the entire top of my head is also very thin. So far, I have experienced pretty much no visible change. There may be just a few new hairs at the front of my scalp, but you really have to take a look up close to notice. I haven&#x27;t really entered a phase of increased shedding, which apparently is supposed to occur before legitimate regrowth. However, my hair loss hasn&#x27;t slowed down either. I&#x27;m still going to give this another half year at least probably, but I&#x27;ve gone through this before with a different minoxidil product and that didn&#x27;t work after 6 months or so. Though, I am trying to be more persistent with my usage this time around. I&#x27;m also on a Saw Palmetto supplement and I take a vitamin powder from GNC which has all kinds of stuff in it.    As far as side effects are concerned, I have one and it&#x27;s annoying...flakes. I thought it was dandruff at first, which I haven&#x27;t had badly in the past at all, and now I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s just flakes from the dried product(s). There isn&#x27;t really any itchiness or irritation (although I was a little itchy for some minutes after only my first usage), it&#x27;s just flakes. I&#x27;ve read about other side effects that don&#x27;t make sense to me such as wrinkly skin or lacking libido. I&#x27;ve always looked a little old for my age butthat&#x27;s just how I am, I don&#x27;t look extra old from putting this on my scalp and certainly am not lacking libido from it.    Anyway, giving this a 3 for the moment because it&#x27;s too early to knock it. Taking pictures every several weeks which I&#x27;ll try to post if I ever have success with this, but again, so far not much change.</li>
    <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s all about just sticking through it and applying the product. It takes time, but trust me it works certain people have different results. For my sake it has helped a lot.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for about 2 years now. The product works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Apply it about 15 minutes post shower in the morning &amp; about an hour before I go to bed. The product does not make my scalp look oily like before.&lt;br /&gt;There has been definite hair growth, saw results in about 2 months after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it to men.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for Men regularly now for the past year.  I can honestly say that this product really works.  I was a user of Rogaine liquid and foam for many years and Lipogaine is far and away a better product.  I had decent results with the Rogaine liquid, but it irritated my scalp severely.  The Rogaine foam was just a complete mess and I could never apply it accurately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then discovered Lipogaine and can honestly say, not only does it work faster than Rogaine, but there is absolutely no scalp irritation whatsoever.  As with any minoxidil based product, you must apply it twice a day (which can become tedious).  However, you will begin to see results rather quickly (about 2 months for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not a miracle cure for baldness, but it does work and is more effective than the other minoxidil based products on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months and have noticed an improvement in the thickness of my hair. Before I started I was experiencing a burning and itching feeling in my scalp and a lot of shedding. After about a month the burning sensation went away and the shedding slowed down. At the 6 month mark, the shedding has stopped and my hair looks healthier, fuller, and thicker. I was skeptical at first but the treatment really seems to be working for me.</li>
    <li> Heard this is a really good product so I brought it for my dad. I will definitely come back if he said it&#x27;s useful.</li>
    <li> Have tried several other products but i would say it was a waste of my hard earned money. This one can be an exception; however, it is not all that perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product since Feb and it appears that the product helps to reduce my hair loss as my hair barber did comment my hair has been fuller than before. I have not seen any significant improvement on restoring the receding hairline on my forehead but again it appears my hairline stop receding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that i gave this only four stars is the product makes my scalp itchy and causes lots of dandruff. But I think I can live with it so that my hair loss at least can be stopped.</li>
    <li> There are lot of minoxidil product. But I really choose Lipogaine products because it has an intensive treatment that really help cure my hair loss problem.</li>
    <li> seems to work a little. I have been trying it for a few weeks, I think I see a little progress.</li>
    <li> No new growth yet but it seems to have slowed my hair receding. Three months use so far, hopefully I see something.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen results yet</li>
    <li> I have got good results with this products. But still not perfect yet. Hope it will get improve with permanent results.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic...Was. I went through a very stressful time and my hair was just falling out! Desperate to do something, I grabbed a bottle of this and after a few months, the hair stopped falling out. Did I get new growth? None that I noticed at my hair line but the area thinning out from stress for sure has come back. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it lasts a very long time. I use it 3 days a week and am still on my first bottle. I didn&#x27;t notice much shedding at the beginning but my hair was falling out any ways so perhaps I didn&#x27;t notice. I recommend trying at least one bottle and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing ever created !!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for last 10 days. i have stop using it because it has adverse effect on my hair. i start losing more hair. i lost most of hair which I able to grow using different products within last 3 months.Anybody can help me to file a lawsuit again this company?my email address is jogeshishah@yahoo.com. I also request Amazon to stop selling such anti hairgrowth products.</li>
    <li> Very potent. The effects are tangible. Totally recommend. I do have to say that once you start using it you must continue using it. Otherwise, you will start to lose the gains you made.</li>
    <li> have been using it for 5 years and it has stopped hair loss and I also have new hair growth</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by the goodlookingloser blog and since then, this brand has been my go to for minoxidil. I even tried buying costco minoxidil to save some money after the first few months of lipograine, but I encountered shedding so I had to order lipogaine again with prime and never looked back. What&#x27;s good about lipogaine is that it doesn&#x27;t get too greasy like some brands. I use azaelic acid separately (skinoren) since it is no longer included in the formula. It&#x27;s worth the extra few bucks to get a non-greasy high quality minoxidil</li>
    <li> No results whatsoever. I used it for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;According to the bottle text: &amp;#34;Most people see results in 3 months, some people may need up to 6 months to see the results.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;With all the youtube videos and positive reviews, I&#x27;m beginning to think this is a very clever scam campaign in order to sell a useless product.&lt;br /&gt;Throw your money out the window instead - saves the daily time and energy spent on this scam.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.</li>
    <li> Probably the best over the counter hair restoration product on the market, and believe me...I&#x27;ve tried many. Not only will Lipogaine help keep the hair you have, over time it you will begin to see new growth. I have more hair today than I did when I was 30!!!</li>
    <li> The best over the counter hair restoration product out there! Helps maintain hair in the crown area, and also aids in regrowing some hair on the top of the scalp, as well as the temples. To be clear, this is NOT a miracle cure, though. But if you&#x27;re looking to maintain with a good chance for some regrowth, Lipogaine is not only worth a shot, but a great value as well.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work well. My only complaint is that it dries a little sticky.</li>
    <li> Been using Lipogaine for 3 years now. Great product that works. Thankyou</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and have noticed a difference. I have not lost any more hair and have seen definite progress with my quickly receding hair line. It has been stopped and my wife made a comment that my hair looks fuller. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and it has truly helped the &amp;#34;thinning spots&amp;#34; on his head. It is not a significant amount of hair loss, just receding spots near his temples. I can&#x27;t really tell but I know that it bugs my husband. He didn&#x27;t want to try other treatments available in box stores for fear that they are laced with strong chemicals that he might be allergic to. He tried Lipogaine, as I was given the chance to do a review on it and was very satisfied with the results. He started growing tufts of tiny hair where his hairline started receding. I am very happy to see how happy my husband was with this product - definitely worth repurchasing and using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried sooo many products before! and of course I was exceptional about trying this. But after giving it a try about the 3rd week of using it mornings and nights I saw a noticeable regrowth on the crown! and it definitely stop my overall shedding, now, like with any other product out there you have to stick with the program! Don&#x27;t stop using it or it won&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy about this product and is the one that I can really use with my hair styling routine, I shower then towel dry my hair, use a light folicure hair spray and after is done I just let the drops fall and roll over directly on my scalp (where it needs to be!) I don&#x27;t massage it because that way it gets more on the hair than on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I definitely recommend it! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Rogaine and then generic Minoxidil for a few years, to pretty decent results -- hair stopped failing out as much. I stopped using it for probably a three-month period maybe two years ago, and the balding accelerated greatly. Despite returning to it, I was never able to regain my previous coverage. I am in my late 30s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had two areas of hair loss -- a triangle roughly 2.5 inches in size on my right forehead, and then on that same side, in the back and top of my head. It necessitated a come-over of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Lipogaine. After two weeks, there were signs of thickening hair.  I am on my third bottle (over about six months) and I&#x27;m about 75 percent to total coverage, the kind of thick hair I had in my early twenties. I use Lipogaine once or twice a day, sometimes using leftover Minoxidil to complement it and as a styling agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve in how to apply it so you hair doesn&#x27;t look too matted. I&#x27;ve had bad hair days because of the gummy feel of this once it dries. You have to get it on your skin, not the hair. Well worth the effort, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a product that has significantly improved my quality of life. If you are curious, I would buy a bottle, try it everyday and see if you see any benefit, as probably not everyone responds to it. It has worked for me, luckily.</li>
    <li> hey guys my name is broderick milburn  im a realy person you can look my up on facebook if you want im telling you this guys this really really works i been using it for 2 month  and im hair is coming back i love it af about two more month with this i will care you guys updated&lt;br /&gt;ps im growing my hairline back for you guys who are looking for something for that like i was  XD</li>
    <li> Very strong, effective solution to grow hair on my receding hairline. Seems to have noticeable impact within one month, started to see hairs growing back. I&#x27;m about 6-7 months into it now and I still don&#x27;t have my full hairline back, but I have to admit I haven&#x27;t been using it twice a day as specified by the product&#x27;s use instructions due to some side effects that I&#x27;ve experienced.  It seriously is very strong and sometimes causes the affected areas of my head to itch and produce a lot of dandruff flakes. At one point, I was getting severe dry skin all over my ears and face so I stopped using it for about a week. After I recovered, I really wanted to try it again and so I started just doing it once a day (morning). I was getting some new hairs to stick around now, but need more to make the area thicker. So now I&#x27;m back to twice a day and am seeing good progress again. I learned to apply only a very thin layer of the product each time and to rinse it off after letting it sit for at least 4 hours to prevent flakiness, and definitely rinse it off before going to bed.  I also take supplement pills (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MMA7W5C?redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5) to help with the hair growth and hair health, but I feel this topical treatment alone is enough to get it done.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than year and half. Lipogaine definitely prevents or at least slows down further hair loss process. I would recommend this product to all the guys who suffer from hair loss.</li>
    <li> Tried many topical Minoxidil 5% treatments. This is by far the best one and worth the few extra dollars. If you can keep up with the treatments and use it religiously, you will see the difference.</li>
    <li> Having tried other products in the past that had a poor odor and equal performance I was hesitant about this product.  But the price was not outrageous so I gave it try and was pleased to notice it had virtually no odor.  The bottle has enough solution for one month which is not enough to see results; after the first month a bought a 3 month supply and have continued doing so.  Having used the product for about 9 months I&#x27;ve seen improvement in hair growth and fullness.  This is not to say I&#x27;ll look like a 70&#x27;s rocker but I&#x27;m sufficiently satisfied with results to keep on using it.  I&#x27;m guessing it won&#x27;t work the same for everyone but if you try it you should anticipate at least 6 months use to determine effectiveness.</li>
    <li> The product is great and easy to use.  It&#x27;s a little bit sticky but I&#x27;m confident works much better than comparable products.  I also find that one bottle does indeed last a month.  With other products I had to use much more to get enough coverage.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if this helped or not. Mixed it with Minoxidil and used both. It didn&#x27;t detract from results, but I&#x27;m unsure if it helped me. Maybe, maybe not. Your mileage may vary. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for the last few months and have been able to retain the hair I have while also growing some back! I&#x27;ve noticed much more hair on the back of my head where it was feeling slick beforehand. I plan on continuing using Lipogaine for as long as possible. So far so good here. Hope it works for you too!</li>
    <li> By far the best treament i have come across that treats and helps regain hair along the hairline, i use lipogain and have seen my hair grow and stay... Will continue to use this product...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for about 10 months. It took a couple of months to see any results, then I started to see some growth in the back/crown, and maybe even a little bit up towards the front (I was applying to both areas). I think the results plateaued after about 6 months (noticed maybe 20% improvement?), and now I use it to maintain that improvement (rather than risk losing it, which I believe I would if I stopped using this product).  Hopefully someday they come up with a cure for male pattern baldness...until then I&#x27;ll likely stick to this combined with finesteride.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  I have on occasion tried other products in its place, but have always returned to Lipogaine.  Let me say that this product has preserved my hair in its present state.  When I took a break, my hair began to thin, but with an immediate return to its use, my hair returned to its more plentiful stable state.  I also find the thicker state of this product adds a fuller look of my hair than other minoxidil products.  It is in this respect, hair preservation,  that I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> I started using Lipogaine about September of 2012.  Within about 2 months, the constant hair loss I was experiencing over the previous few/several years had stopped.  From that point until about April of 2013 I saw a wonderful amount of regrowth.  Regrowth meaning that areas of my scalp that had very little hair left, were repopulated significantly (not fully), giving me coverage, and other thin areas were now thick/dense as it used to be.  I was rather amazed at the point, and had my first sigh of relief and hope since the last few/several years.  I was also doing scalp/galea loosening exercises during this time, some home low-light-laser therapy (LLLT), as well as consuming 2-4 teaspoons of flaxseed oil a day.  (A tight scalp may reduce blood flow through the capillary network for the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, sometime in April progress seemed to stop, and I might have experienced a bit of hair loss again thereafter.  I lost some faith in my routine, although perhaps it was just temporary (There might be a pattern of spring-time hair loss for me).  Also, I had read that for some men minoxidil works for a while then somehow loses effectiveness. I thought maybe that was happening. Because of that and the irritation and itching I experience from Lipogaine (learned later that I was applying too much). I began reducing my application to once a day, and became complacent and inconsistent with it, while focusing on scalp exercises.  Over several more months I noticed a slight decline in density, but not overly concerned. 2014 was pretty much the same – inconsistent application, scalp exercises, and LLLT, while realizing slow thinning and loss of density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late December 2014, I stopped applying Lipogaine completely.  Sometime in late February I began to shed significantly. It is now mid April and I have lost a lot, and still shedding.  This might be one of my worst points in hair loss, and very concerned.  Needless to say, I’ve started back on Lipogaine, however applying less than I did before over the scalp. This has reduced the itchiness.  I’ll see what happens from here.  Based on my experience, I think Lipogaine can have a significant positive regrowth effect (if even for a time), and at the least can significantly slow thinning and loss of density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note what others have said about applying Lipogaine.  Try to apply it directly to the scalp.  You don’t need very much on the scalp, and in a minute you’ll see it absorb into the skin.  I keep the dropper/applicator out of the bottle, and put only the tip in when drawing some out.  This keeps the solution off of the glass applicator, and thus, less gets in your hair.</li>
    <li> I buy Lipogain because it is not greasy and has a lot of extra hair friendly ingredients. I works well and I have been using it for a number years.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel comfortable with too many dandruff and harsh chemicals, no fun experiments twice a day and I have no plan to use it again.</li>
    <li> Slowly but surely this works, Covering my recess  line. I wish I got more thickness, but might be too early for full thickness. I&#x27;ve been using it less than 2 months</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while, on and off.&lt;br /&gt;When I just started using it for a few months, I feel that I have more hair, and I stopped (being lazy).&lt;br /&gt;Then the hair started getting thinner and the balding starts showing.&lt;br /&gt;This last time I made an effort to use it everyday, and its been close to 6 months.  My hair are fuller and thicker.  My family noticed it too, my daughter, who always kid me on the balding, said that &amp;#34;Dad you have more hair&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I am not exactly sure that it regrows hair, but I can say for certain that my hair does not fall as much, as evidenced by there is not much falling hair on the bathroom counter top, not on the pillow case etc, and I do noticed the thicker and fuller hair.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any rashes or irritation on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using this product as it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product and service!</li>
    <li> Tried it for a month, nothing. Regenepure is the only hair loss treatment that some what works. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This product works well for my husband. He complimented the product by adding, &amp;#34;the product goes on cleanly and has the consistency of hairspray.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using this for last year, but I haven&#x27;t really seen any improvement as yet. For first 6 months I used 1 ml twice daily, and for last 6 months I&#x27;m using only 1 ml daily. My father who has quite a bit balding also has been using this for about 6 months, but he didn&#x27;t get any results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used minoxidil for years and began to notice that the produce was not working any longer.  I started using Lipogain that has supplements beyond the monoxidil that help reinvigorate the hair and stimulate growth and definitely stopped the thinning.  It is a great product and should be considered as an overall treatment plan.</li>
    <li> I used this religiously for 3 months, it did NOT regrow any new hair. It did make the hair I already have have feel strong(er), kind of like straw. Left a yellow stain on my scalp if it didn&#x27;t dry correctly. I would NOT recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to contact the seller @one point to complain about a leaking package I received, and they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer. Replaced the product without an additional charge, or any fuss. If I could give a separate review for them it would be positive, as for the product they are selling...like I stated before it simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is the best product out there for hair loss. Unfortunately it is very expensive, because for less than 1 of these you can get a 3 month supply of the plain generic minoxidil. So if you have the money, get this no doubt.</li>

This product is intended for use on men only, reviewing this item with hubby using product and telling his thoughts on the product while also telling you about the product to the best of my knowledge!***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is your holistic approach to fuller hair if your a man that’s interested in hair regrowth without unknown chemicals or if your a gal looking for a product for your man that’s a natural alternative to something he may already be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby’s words:&lt;br /&gt;The product takes a few minutes to dry but there is no itch or anything bothersome. The smell isn’t terrible which is surprising as he was expecting a stronger smell from it. He said it was easy to apply daily and it became a part of his routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my husband has one thick full head of hair, he has no issues in that department, however he has zilch for facial hair. No idea why, but he’s had issues growing facial hair for a long time! This might be awesome to some but not to him so seeing as we had seen this has been used by others to help with beard growth as well he tried it out! He went from baby face to having a good bit of hair growth over his lip, some areas more than others but he’s continuing to use the product! These results are enough to have him wanting to keep using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> Been on this four about 5 months. I had used regular generic minoxidil for about a mont prior to this. Lipogaine feels like a much higher quality product in my opinion. It drys faster and dosnt make my skin peel as much. I&#x27;m only 5 months in but I do see some pretty good results so far. I&#x27;m also on propecia and am using LLLT. Shall see how this goes.</li>
    <li> After doing some research,  I came across lipogaine,  and this stuff finally works. I tried all kinds of stuff before using this. Being African-American,  I wasnt sure if I could find something that works on my hair type because all the other hair products that promise regrowth,  they used all white people. I was on YouTube and I saw a video of this African-American guy using it and his hair grew back in like 6 months, and people were giving him a hard time and saying he was never balding in the first place. Well at this point I had spent a lot of money on other stuff and it was costing me money. U have to give each product u try at least 6 months to 12 months. Im 28, and I dont have time to waste because I dont look right with a bald head. I was tired getting my hair cut to blend in my sides every week. So looking at the negative feedback this guy was getting because people assume he was faking it because his hair grew back full in 6 months,  I decided I will give it a try because he is the only African-American I have seen using any of these regrowth products and he has a full head of hair.  I spent 12 months using this crap called SCALP MED, and they were a scam. It might work for some people but for me, it was costing me $80 a month,  and once u start using it, u cant really stop until u see results.  So 12 months of my life was wasted. So going back to the youtube video, I decided to order this stuff, lipogaine,  and I noticed my hair line in like 2months, it was so cool, I saw little hairs along my hairline that I havent seen In 5years. 6 months later my hair filled in.  5yrs of searching and trying products,  and I now use something for African-American men. I walk around now looking like my real age not a 40yr man balding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give thanks to jesus on this. ..for those who believe in him, I prayed one night and I told God I was running out of money trying all this stuff and it was super embarrassing walking around in the summer with a hat onall day.. I asked God to show me the exact product I need to use. That same day the lord led me youtube and as I was searching something totally different from what I was looking for, I looked down and saw this African-American guy on YouTube talking about lipogaine.  I never heard of lipogaine until that video.</li>
    <li> Have been using them for about a year, nothing happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended!</li>
    <li> i tried this... and after weeks of no change, was told by my wife that i was VERY grumpy, and a LOT angrier than i have EVER been. also went to the Dr as it raised my heart rate a LOT... do not use if you have heart issues..</li>
    <li> I have used all the generic minoxidils and Lipogaine is by far the best. I have used lipogaine for 3 months now. I got the expected shed the first month and the new hairs are coming in and my hair looks a lot healthier and darker too. Some people use generic minox once a day and lipogaine once a day together. I would recommend using just the lipogaine twice a day to get the best of it.</li>
    <li> 6 months later it just didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I have been using lipogaine for about 16 months and I can honestly say it has worked to an extent.  I am in my late 30&#x27;s and my hair has always been thin but of course the older you get the more noticeable it becomes.  I am showing signs of thinning around the crown and my so-called friends let me know about it.  It bothers me but I couldn&#x27;t show them that.  The lipogaine has helped my hair grow back some but its not the miracle potion to make the thinning go away 100% but I can say it&#x27;s the best thinning solution I have used and I continue to use it.  I have been pretty pleased with the results at least now it takes my thinning hair back to the stage it was in my early 30&#x27;s where it wasn&#x27;t as embarrassing as last year</li>
    <li> No results for my hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about eight months now.  The initial results were promising, and I continue to grow light hair.  However, the new growth does not stay.  Much of the new growth falls out again, so it appears that I have reached a plateau.  It has definitely slowed the thinning process and has generally helped me to maintain my hair.  The best thing about Lipogaine, as compared with other Minox products, is that it dries quickly.  Many over the counter Minox solutions leave my hair greasy feeling for hours.  Lipogaine does not do this.  It is sticky, not unlike a styling product.  But that is to be expected.  I will continue to use Lipogaine, as it is the best Minox product that I have found thus far.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Lipogaine for almost three months and I can say that it has helped with his hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decreased loss of hairs - balding has slowed considerably&lt;br /&gt;Overall hair texture feels thicker&lt;br /&gt;Increased regrowth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair tends to be a bit stiff but this can be resolved with using a bit less that the amount prescribed.</li>
    <li> I order Lipogaine every month and use it once a night (before bed). The reason I like Lipogaine is because it seems to work quite well and is a safer option than Propecia. I stopped taking Propecia about a year ago and have felt way better/happier since then. During that time I kept using Lipogaine and really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in hair loss when switching to just Lipogaine. Overall, this seems to have a better chemical make up than cheaper products like Rogaine. Combine Lipogaine (every night) with Nizoral or Regenepure Shampoo (1x a week) for best results.</li>
    <li> I purchased lipogaine with scepticism thinking like most products it would be a complete waste of money. Anyway I began noticing early staging of hair loss with the front hairline although not particularly noticeable yet enough for me to buy lipogaine. The first 2 weeks I was alarmed at the sheer level of hair shedding , however as you probably know its a sign the product is working. So I continued applying twice a day as instructed and after 10-12 weeks I was noticing small hairs appearing and after 4 months the receding area had improved by 25%. I was very pleased thinking if I continue using this product I will eventually have a full head of hair. Unfortunately after month 4 there was no improvement and this continues to be the case after 7 months. So in a nutshell it is not a long term solution and I am now contemplating having an fue transplant! A word of caution if buying lipogaine, one bottle will not last anything like the 4 weeks it suggests!</li>
    <li> Im 24, I have been using the lipogane for about a year and some change, after i did some research about it. and its the only product I use since my hair started to thin. It gets the job done if your looking for something to help regrow and fight thinning hair in the begging stages ..best product for your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months and I have seen great results.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several products and this one has been the best thus far.</li>
    <li> I think after the second purchase we could really see the difference!!! He was very skeptical about the whole thing but once he started seeing results he was sold!!!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this for 3 months. I really didn&#x27;t see any improvement. actually I started losing more hair. went back to Kirkland minoxidil. much cheaper and I put twice as much. but I love their shampoo</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for about a year now and it works noticeably better then when I used Kirkland 5% minoxidal only, especially in the front. For front thinning or balding I have noticed great improvement. The product is always shipped fasted on time and packaged great. I would only recommend using it with the Micro  needle too for even better results.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  I love this treatment...my hair has shown great results!</li>
    <li> For nearly a year I have been using Lipogaine and I can definitely say that it works. While it&#x27;s not as thick and luxurious as it was in my younger years it has certainly halted the hair loss and has grown back a bit on my vertex and also the front of my hairline. I notice that when combining this product with regular exercise my hair comes back even thicker. Also I want to add this product does not work overnight. It does take a while and you will shed in the beginning, but as I said, it does work.</li>
    <li> Besides not working it&#x27;s sticky, putting it on at night time and waking up in the morning feels like you have honey in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;TERRIBLE.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give any chest pains. It is not itchy or smelly. It is very potent and along with finasteride, seems to be very effective. It works for frontal hair too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular Minoxidil user for over 6 years now.  I switched to Lipogaine about 3 years ago after my previous brand (DS Labs Spectral DNC) suddenly switched their formula to an ingredient called &amp;#34;Nanoxidil&amp;#34; (whatever nonsense that is) and it was awful.  I am happy to say that Lipogaine has worked to maintain my hair very well -  especially on the crown.  My hair is still slowly receding up front (thank you DNA!) but it definitely has slowed down the process. I use the product everyday, usually one application in the AM and occasionally at night.  Aside from some minor itching and dryness (which clears up quickly with a good quality shampoo and conditioner), I can happily say I have never experienced major side affects.  I like the measured dropper that allows the right amount of product to be applied.  The formula dries fast compared to the last brand I used and even adds some volume.  I rarely use styling products because this stuff asks like it&#x27;s own styling product if you catch it towards the very end of drying and rub gently with a towel.  Be diligent with application- minoxidil is a commitment.  I would definitely recommend Lipogaine to guys looking for a quality minoxidil product.</li>
    <li> It works but not that good as I expected. At least I am not losing that much hair as with \\&quot;help\\&quot; of other products based on minoxidil.</li>
    <li> I think the product became really watered down. The consistency of the liquid is not the same as it used to be. Before it was a thick, oily, yellow, very viscous fluid. Now it&#x27;s almost close to water, very very light in color, no oil what so ever. I was very happy with this product before and really felt like it was helping my hairloss but ever since the change in some of the ingredients I feel the product is not working as well.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it said it would do. What more can I say...</li>
    <li> Hate it. I tried using this and lost the hair which is actually  healthy. DONT BUY this crap</li>
    <li> I am the type of person that does an extensive amount of research before buying something, especially when I decided to buy something to start taking care of my thinning hair. I chose Lipogaine because it is only topical, as some of the ingested solutions can have seriously negative side effects. Also, not only does it have the active ingredient of minoxidil that increases blood flow to the area, but also other ingredients that like saw palmetto that help seed the scalp for hair growth as well.    I was 21 when I started using Lipogaine and have been for about 2 years now. I noticed results after about the first 3 months when it seemed my hair stopped falling out and baby hairs were noticeable. After 6 is when friends and my girlfriend started mentioning that my hair appeared to be thicker and fuller. Before I had to keep my hair very short in order not to accentuate my thinning, but now I can go to a barber and enjoy getting an undercut done. In order to truly get results and not lose them, you have to be strict on using Lipogaine twice a day EVERYDAY, otherwise it will stop working, and in fact your body will seem to want to make up for lost time and encourage your hair to fall out faster.    After combining the topical solution with the Big 3 shampoo, I have noticed that the my hair completely stops shedding altogether, nothing on my fingers when i run my hands through my hair in the shower. This product worked better than I had hoped and I encourage anyone to give it a try before resorting to riskier or more expensive solutions.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he is experiencing hair thinning in the front of the scalp. Rogaine indicated that it will not work on front scalp thinning so I thought to give this a try. We have noticed less hair loss in the front scalp and there are hair starting to grow back in the thinning area. So it seems to work. It is not, however, an instant, magic solution so don&#x27;t expect overnight results. We went on travel for 2 weeks once and he forgot to bring the bottle. We then noticed that hair loss was happening more than usual again. So there&#x27;s definitely negative results when you stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it goes in the long run but so far, we are happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years, and it doesn&#x27;t have any odor and has not irritated my scalp, unlike other minoxidil-based products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  However, it does leave my hair very sticky and has a yellowish tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed much, if any, hair growth, but my hair loss has slowed down/stabilized.  All in all, if you&#x27;re in the market for a minoxidil-based hair loss product, you may want to try Lipogaine.  Just have reasonable expectations.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it any more since it no longer contains azelaic acid which helps keep hair from falling out.  i now buy one from The Minoxidil Store that is 5% minoridil and 15% azelaic acid.</li>
    <li> Started using this product about five months ago noticed within a couple of months regrowth of hair in the crown vortex area significant results in thickness I am very impressed with product and will recommend this product to anyone suffering from thinning loss of hair</li>
    <li> Gives me itch and dries my scalp completely</li>
    <li> only used for month and a half.  Hair is already beginning to grow back!  great when combined with a derma roller.</li>
    <li> I have been using lipogaine for 5 months now. I must say that I have seen some regrowth in the crown area of my head. Also, I have seen a little regrowth in my hairline as well. I am hoping to see more growth after a few more months to come. I can say that this product has worked in comparison to other products I have used.</li>
    <li> Just ok ...No real big results for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my dad. He has tried many other product in the past. Lipogaine seems to be working for him. He likes the ingredients. in both the drops and shampoo. He is very excited about the results with Lipogaine.</li>
    <li> I started using Minoxidil more than 3 years ago. The result was not bad and not good. My hair loss had stopped but I didn&#x27;t grow new hair. I got disappointed....I did a little bit research on the internet and I cam across Lipogaine. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year now and I&#x27;ve seen new hair on my head. When I go to get a haircut every month, they always mention that WOW you&#x27;re getting more hair each time. I think the secret to Lipogaine is that they use a good carrier for the minoxidil. It will easily absorb by the skin and that&#x27;s why it works. I will happily use it forever (if it&#x27;s what it takes to keep my hair :) )</li>
    <li> I have been using it from a month now. No progress.. But lets see.. It says try for 3-4 months. Overall no side effects to me.</li>
    <li> Alright guys Im going to make this brief so you get what you want quick. Im white, 26, and have thin wavy hair. I began balding at 19, by 25 I was having trouble convincing myself I wasnt a norwood 4. It was bad and I had used rogaine foam and propecia from age 23-24 and felt unsatisfied. I believe now I was having positive results but because I was young and naive and shed from them I didnt make a objective adult evaluation of the results. I told myself I would not write this review until I had been using the product for 4 months. In this time I have used 5 bottles, I use it all over my scalp. Please do not put stock or even read reviews in which the reviewer has only been using the product for 2 weeks, unless they mention a shed or scalp reaction. If they say &amp;#34;2 weeks and I see new hair&amp;#34; they are completely full of you know what, or not in reality. I am at 4 months now and guys I am the happiest I have been in a long time. All hair that shed at the one month mark has returned and unless you are closely inspecting me, my mpb is not very noticeable. My hair loss has always been such a source of embarrassment for me that I would never comfortably discuss it openly with anyone. I recently attended a christmas party and received so many compliments of how good I looked that I actually opened up to some people. 6 months ago....the thought of this would make me cringe. So in conclusion here is my routine....1mg propecia, biotin supplement, microneedling my scalp before lipogaine application, lipogaine over crown, vertex, mid scalp, and frontal scalp usually only once a day.......every day. I also recommend lipogaine shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is total waste i used it for 1 year and i see more hair loss..baldness...stress problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont know who are these people giving 4/5 ratings. For god sake please stop fooling people.</li>
    <li> After 10 days from secretely using this product, my wife told me that I look 10 years younger (similar to when we got married), This works great. I used Rogain several years ago and caused severe itching, then I stopped. This product gave me very minimal itching, which is overcomed by shampooing with similar product every 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over four months now. I took photos at day one and have been taking one every month. The results are very noticeable! Seeing the results has driven me to continue use and see great results. It is very simple to use and becomes a pretty sime routine. I also purchased the recommend shampoo. A little goes a long way! Very please and it is nice to see my hair on my head and not on my pillow!</li>
    <li> My story is very complicated, so please bare with me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June 2013, I received an ACL reconstruction, which led to Telogen Effluvium. My family has a long history of baldness or somewhere close to baldness, so I knew genetics was a primary cause. My hair became so thin and hairline receded tremendously, so I jumped on finasteride (brand name Propecia) and Lipogaine in October. After being on finasteride for 2 months, I could not take the initial shed+depression anymore, so I dropped finasteride in December. I continued using Lipogaine until now. I saw major regrowth until March, but started seeing a lot of shedding starting April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is almost back to where I started October 2013, and shedding is still going on. In addition to shedding, my scalp feels itchy as hell, tingles every minute, and feels irritated all the time. I am taking natural supplements currently such as vitamin B complex, MSM, silica, iodine, iron, and biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing about this product is that it affects your sexual desire and mood. I have used this product for longer than 7 months and now I do not have much sexual desire. My libido is fine, but I don&#x27;t feel like having sex or masturbate. I&#x27;ve never had this issue until recently. Also, please keep in mind that low sexual desire/change in mood started simultaneously with increased shedding. Shedding has been going on for approximately two months. There are tons of posts about low sexual desire from Lipogaine when you search on Google. I was very skeptical of those comments, but now I know for a fact that this product is the culprit. I am returning the last bottle I have. If you want to use this product, please use it for 6 months or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, so do not take my words as recommendation. Do your due diligence please.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a couple years now.  It one of the best minoxidil I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m using it as a preventive measure.  I actually grew some hair and my hair looks thicker. I haven&#x27;t lost any hair since using it either.  It has a lot of other great ingredients as well. When it had azelaic acid it was even better, but it got banned:( I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price and even better results. Recommended to anyone who wants to keep or regrow their hair.</li>
    <li> Chris A.- I have been using this product for several months now, and it is by far the best minoxidil product I have ever uses. I have noticed most if not all of my hair loss has subsided. Also, my existing hair is thicker. I am also seeing some new hairs. One of the best things about this product is the way it dries on the scalp. Other generic and name brand products leave an oily film on the hair. This product dries completely and leaves the hair feeling thicker. Also the price for this product is very reasonable. Other products that have similar ingredients go for twice the price. I will be using this product until there is a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;! Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had thinning hair around my hairline for some time now. (The sand traps formation). I tried many of the all-natural, herbal topical creams/sprays with little, if any, results. Minodoxil 5%, alone, did not seem to work either. (However, that product even states that results are normally only found in the &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; region). But, to my surprise, Lipogaine has not only thickened the barely visible stalks of hair that were still alive, but also regrown some hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did happen over night, of course. It took about three months to begin seeing results. But I am very glad that I stuck with the regimen. I suggest using a micro needle stamp/roller in conjunction with Lipogaine for aid with the absorption. (The micro needles also break down the scar tissue, allowing for the skin cells to regenerate and hopefully make way for the new hairs. - I&#x27;m not a doctor but, if you research the benefits of the micro needle stamp/roller, you&#x27;ll see why it helps). You may also wish to take finasteride/propecia and an amino acid supplement.  I use all of the aforementioned and have had wonderful results thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for about two years now and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. Lipogaine has been the only product that has improved the look my hairline and I plan to stick with it for years to come.</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used other hair products from amazon before, none of them could give me satisfying results. I started to use lipogaine 3 months ago, just wanted to change a product. I did not have too much expectation for it either, just like other products. Surprisingly, after  a few bottles, my hair seems to be thicker and healthier. Honestly, I have never written reviews for any products, and this is the first one I&#x27;m really willing to recommend to other people who have the same hair problem.</li>
    <li> HI&lt;br /&gt;I just received and started using Lipogaine for men on the 12th July so it is too early to give a honest positive review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did arrive well packaged and very quickly from supplier and will definitely use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product I have found it does make my hair slightly sticky but that’s not a problem I just brush the stickiness out when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t experienced any itchiness or redness of the scalp only some minor shedding which is expected at this early point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Lipogaine and I will update progress of any regrowth of hair or any problems every 3 months</li>
    <li> oily residue just like basic rogaine, hate that oily feeling. went back to spectral dnc</li>
    <li> Product works great. I&#x27;ve used it consistently with the lipogaine shampoo for about a year now. I&#x27;ve noticed the hair I have seems thicker and more full and it seems to have stopped the hair loss I was having. I prefer this to other products because it doesn&#x27;t have all the alcohol to dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> Bought it once my hairline was starting to go. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 7 months, it&#x27;s easy to use and washes out without leaving residue, unless you leave it in all day for some reason.  I&#x27;ve been seeing slow but steady growth on my hairline, which is fine given how notoriously hard the front of the hairline is to grow back.</li>
    <li> I use the shampoo and really like it. I have only just started using this intensive treatment but I am really looking forward to it. I&#x27;m hoping most of these reviews here are real. I will update this and tell of my own results soon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for over 4 years and it is much better than just using Minoxidil or Rogaine  alone.  I have seen appreciable results with much more fill in of new hair on the crown of my head. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just under two years to combat a receding hairline. My hair loss has been slow and began 5 years prior to using this product. I have no hair loss on my crown. At the same time I began using this product, I also began using a ketoconazole shampoo daily to additionally help prevent hair loss. Lipogaine has helped me successfully stop my hair loss. My hairline looks the same or a little better than it did the day I began using the two products. I did get some minor regrowth due to the minoxidil in this product. It definitely did not regrow everything I had lost, but it was good to get some back. The only downfall of this product is that the hair around where it is applied gets stiff as if sprayed by hair spray.</li>
    <li> This is the first review that I have actually sat down to write. I&#x27;ll share my personal experience. About 3 years ago, I would be in the shower and notice more hair than usual.left in the bottom and the walls after I was done.so I took notice. After a while when I was combing/brushing my hair at the sink, I would see more hair. Okay, I was starting to freak out a little.I went shopping on amazon looking for products...don&#x27;t know why and I didn&#x27;t read any reviews but I chose Lipogaine. I used it for several months...6 or so and noticed a reduction in the lost hair in the shower and at the sink. I went shopping at Costco and bought the Kirkland brand of minoxidil I was encouraged by my girlfriend..and didn&#x27;t even use one can before my head started to itch and I am not sure of fact ... but to me that is an indication of &amp;#34;hair falling out&amp;#34;. I  quickly ordered more Lipogaine and have been a faithful user since. You can try all the other products you like ..... but my advice is to not screw around and use a product that works! Cheers!</li>
    <li> I have tried a majority of the products on the market but I find that Lipogaine is simply the best for my hair. With Rogaine and some of the Minoxidil based products, they simply weren&#x27;t strong enough to keep my hair growing after more than a year. The problem seemed to be that they simply did not have enough of the DHT inhibitors and other active ingredients necessary to keep my male pattern baldness from coming back and I would shed my new growth after a few months. With Lipogaine, I don&#x27;t have the dry powdery feeling of basic minoxidil, nor do I have the thick, greasy feeling that I get with other mixtures or proprietary concoctions on the market. Lipogaine keeps my hair full looking and my new growth is sill in place, well after 18 months of continuous use and I don&#x27;t get the itchy feeling that I used to get with solutions that didn&#x27;t effectively block the DHT in my scalp. Lipogaine also doesn&#x27;t stain my pillow while I sleep at night which was another problem that I had with other products in the past. With Lipogaine, I love seeing my fuller, thinker hair in the mirror and I no longer have that regretful feeling anymore, wishing there was something on the market that worked. Lipogaine works for me!</li>
    <li> Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Grows slightly thicker hair over time, even on the receding hairline area (not just the crown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Slightly Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Have to use twice everyday, does dry out the hair after few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine seems to grow hair on the crown area, and a little bit on my receding hairline area as well. It seems better than just using rogaine, as before this, i have tried the rogaine foam for more than an year, before starting on Lipogaine. Rogaine grew some hair on the crown area, which fell out later, almost none in the receding hairline area. But it did not make much difference. Then I did lot more research and decided to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few weeks, this really irritated my scalp, but i started seeing thin hair growing in 2-3 weeks. Though that hair fell out, i continued using this and now i have slightly more thicker hair (not as thick as my original hair, but slightly thicker than the first time around), the irritation continued for few more weeks, then either it stopped, or i got used to it :-) To go with this, I had also used different shampoos like Nioxin, which used to give good volume to the hair. But I think this combination started causing serious flaking on the scalp. I have stopped Nioxin since then, picked up Regenepure-DR and now finally, Purador, which seems to be doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been using Lipogaine for more than an year now, have grown slightly thicker hair and am satisfied with my experience. It is slightly expensive but seeing that it is preserving my existing hair and growing some more, I plan to continue with this and see how much more thicker my  hair can get. Mind you, at-least for me, it is not regrowing all the hair lost, just some of it. I guess what&#x27;s lost was lost permanently when i was ignoring my balding in early 30s.</li>
    <li> I have used a few similar products in the last 18 months and this one works and applies the best.  Not yet seeing regrowth yet but the drastic thinning has stopped.</li>
    <li> Since my early thirties my hair has been thinning I would guess I have maybe 75% of the hair I had in my twenties and Im late forties now. After reading all the great reviews for Lipogaine I thought I would give it a shot, my experience has been good, not great but good. After maybe three weeks small new thin hairs were appearing at the hair line as well as a small lowering of the middle hair line, this continued for a few months and kind of leveled off to having maybe 85% of my hair so a 10% gain, not too bad really. One odd effect was hair was growing between my eyebrows and ears and even under my eyes, nothing a razor can&#x27;t fix, but shows the stuff does work. Zero side affects for me.</li>
    <li> Good product and works as advertised. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Finally something that works I have try many things in the past and this is the only thing that works I&#x27;m a very happy customer THANK YOU :)</li>
    <li> Iam a medical student and i bought this product using third party company...It is great product and better than other brands it drys faster after one month of using it my hair stopped falling out and now i feel it is thicker than before ... iam also use multivitamins ,saw pallmeto extract ,biotin .. I give it 4 stars because the price it high ..after three months i will update this review.</li>
    <li> Seems to be slowing down the hair loss progress.  Not seeing any new growth, but I think this is helping</li>
    <li> My hair is not falling as much. I have been using this product for few years now and think it helps.</li>
    <li> I switched over to 5% Lipogaine for Men since the 10% Minoxidil from another company was discontinued...and that was several years ago. The initial transition from 10% to 5% minoxidil was harsh because all my beautiful hair that grew from the 10% fell out, but I believe that if it wasn&#x27;t for this Lipogaine I would&#x27;ve been in much worse shape. I still have a full head of hair, and still using Lipogaine for men, but  I don&#x27;t respond as well to it as I used to. However, it is defitnitely maintaining what I have left..There are some days, that I see a lot of hair in the shower drain, and some days I don&#x27;t see as much. But when I look at my hair closely in the mirror, I still see baby strands sprouting up. So there you go....I will be a Lipogaine user for a long,  long time... Too scared to stop...</li>
    <li> Not sure how good it works but would recommend over rogaine. I used this consistently for 1/12 than switched to rogaine foam which seemed to increase hair loss, came back to lipogaine and want go back. I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and no sticky and does not itch like other liquids. Use twice a day.</li>
    <li> Good value, seems to work better than the other product I had been using.  Combining this with the shampoo is a good idea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and have had tremendous results. Experienced hair regrowth and thickening. It&#x27;s a little greasy so I only use at night, but the the results are fantastic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not going to grow new hair for you but so far it helps you keep the hair that you have. It dries quick and is not too messy.</li>
    <li> I started using Rogaine in 1988 when it was  a 2 per cent solution and then switched to the 5 per cent . After several years, the results began to fade. I recently started with Lipogaine and could tell a big difference. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants an upgrade.</li>
    <li> hair feels a little thicker.</li>
    <li> Very good product!!!!! I really happy with the results. Its take at least 4 to 6 months to see the results...</li>
    <li> Can definitely tell a difference in losing less hair while using this product and when you combine it with the lipogaine shampoo in time you will also see growth and if you have a receding hairline it will decrease</li>
    <li> Good product . Ordered lipogaine oil and big3 shampoo about a year ago it worked great, stopped for a little bit but now I am back using it again , it has stopped/ decreased  my hair loss&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve been able to find on amazon for countering the effects of hair loss. Reasonable price and good mix of essential ingredients.  Perhaps some day we&#x27;ll be able to get a higher percent of minoxidil.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I&#x27;ve tried romaine and other off-brand variations but this product is the best! I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 7 months consistently and I have really noticed a curtailing in the amount of shedding that I&#x27;m experiencing. Plus my h feels healthier and it doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp oily. Plus they send out quickly so I&#x27;ve never had to miss a dose! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money this does not do anything to hair loss you will continue loosing it until nature or genes stop the process</li>
    <li> I did some research to buy the Minoxidil for hair loss and find this product that has multiple ingredients. I decided to give a try. I was losing my front head hair a lot. After using the product, I can feel the hair is regrowing. My friends is also saying my hair is coming back. I would recommend this product for you if you are also having the same problem.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair regrowth product that I have actually seen results from.  I have tried other products (Rogaine from Costco), but none have produced similar results. I think it&#x27;s the blend this product uses that made the difference for me. The only suggestion I can make is to be patient and diligent - this product took about three months of DAILY applications before I saw new hair. As long as you keep using it, the hair stays.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and used it like it said and to be honest it made his hair fall out way more than before!!! Very disappointed</li>
    <li> just go bald save your money, when you meet the right girl she wont care about your hairline, but instead your bank line muahaha money talks baby</li>
    <li> Great product and should get great results</li>
    <li> i am 40 and have been losing my hair for 15 years. I have had a receding hairline that was dead and could never grow back; however, this stuff is doing it. after three months my hair line that was slick and shinny has quater inch long hair all over it. Lipogaine has done more in three months than rogaine has done in 10 years. My hair is growing back all the way down to my original hair line. I would not believe it if i didn&#x27;t see it. Everyone else sees it too. My wife, my kids and my parents are all blown away, mostly because they know the results i had with rogaine. i use dawn dish washing liquid to scrub and clean my head with a tooth brush, rinse thoroughly or just wipe off with towel, then i use a generic 192 micro needle skin care roller and then apply the lipogaine. that is it. i do it twice a day. Amazing. i wish i could have found this 15 years ago.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t last a month with less than normal use. With normal use will be gone in 2-3 weeks. Doesn&#x27;t work at all. It leaves your scalp feeling slimey and nasty and your hair feeling like straw. Total waste of money. I did not even see the slightest improvement--I used it for several months too. All the other crap in it must lessen the potency of the Minoxidil, either that, or its a really crappy quality grade minoxidil. Do yourself a favor and get Costco or CVS brand minoxidil or real Rogaine instead.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for one month. I noticed it has minoxidil which also Rogaine has. One month is too soon to notice change, which I have not seen. But I have noticed something and it is that this produces a massive itch, could be that Im allergic or something. But in my opinion it is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Minoxidil has proven benefits. If you use (or are planning to use) minoxidil, this is a solid, well made formulation that is much less irritating than the name brand. In addition, it has other ingredients that augment the effectiveness. I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for at least 3 years and I believe it is markedly better than other brands at delivering the benefits of minoxidil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now. Did nothing else but this. Sometimes once, sometimes twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first 2 months I have seen pretty significant hair growth. Now on month 3,4 it kind if just levels off. I&#x27;m still bald. Oh well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medical hair restoration is going to be a future goal.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a couple of years now and have been pleased with results.  Not a full head of hair- but hair loss has stopped with some growth noticeable.  Been struggling with hair loss for 28yrs and have tried most everything and have managed to keep a lot of my hair on my head.  Good product easy to use- biggest thing is keeping what Hair I have left on front region of scalp-hairline has stopped receding in the front- can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
    <li> i will be buying this stuff until i die! great stuff! ive been using for about a year, most of my hair has grown back, not 100% regrowth but like 80% at least. dont assume you will grow all of your hair back, it wont. it will grow a good amount of it back though. keep in mind i am 19, didnt have that much of hair loss in the first place.</li>
    <li> 3rd month of use i &amp; i coul see the difference great product, user need to patiente</li>
    <li> still in the testing mode. have seen any results yet but i only strt like a month now so more time need</li>
    <li> I was loosing my hairs a lot especially after using hair products from Axe. First 1.5 months of using this product my hair loss increased dramatically (they have warning about it), but I&#x27;ve decide it to give it a shot. And to my surprise after 4 months of using product my hair lose is way fewer than it was before even though I&#x27;m still using Axe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products including Rogaine brand and off brands and Lipogaine has given me the best results in a number of areas.  For one, I believe it stops hair loss if used on a regular basis.  A good way to judge this is to see if any hairs come out when you comb or brush your hair.  Basically, you shouldn&#x27;t have hairs coming out daily.  For me, when using this product, no hairs come out.  I&#x27;ve not sure how well any of these products work for re-growing hair that has fallen out already, but it does allow me to keep what I&#x27;ve got.  Another feature I like about this product is it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my scalp like the Rogaine related products to.  That residue tends to dry and flake on some occasions.  Lipogaine seems to absorb better and just feels like it disperses into the scalp better.  The bottle is small but with the dropper, a little goes a long way and one bottle lasts about a month and that&#x27;s with using it twice per day.  Remember, results when it comes to hair don&#x27;t happen over night or within a week or two.  With hair it usually takes an ongoing steady routine.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used for my thinning hair. I tried quite a few other products, but this by far is the most effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;Filled in my bald spot almost completely. DHT blocker is big. Keeps my hair on my head and not down the drain. Been using&lt;br /&gt;this product for a while now. Results don&#x27;t happen overnight. Took about 6 months for me to actually see results. The wait was well worth it for me. will continue to use this product. Verry satisfied with the results. Thank you Lipogaine for restoring my confidence in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Have seen a reversal in my thinning hair. Been using for over a year and don&#x27;t plan on stopping. Highly recommended for real results.</li>
    <li> (Posting on my wifes Amazon Prime account)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I feel I need to give encouragement for anyone who might have been in the same situation as me before I purchased this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a male in my early 30&#x27;s and have a family history of hair loss.  I actually began losing my hair in high school so having a product like Lipogaine available (that actually works!) is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for about a year now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  My hair is MUCH thicker and it&#x27;s helped my confidence a lot.  I actually used it previously for a few months but got discouraged and impatient because I didn&#x27;t notice the results I was looking for.  My wife encouraged me to give it another try and I&#x27;m very grateful I listened to her advice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, if you&#x27;re on the fence about getting this product, get it and be patient.  Use it as directed and I&#x27;m confident you&#x27;ll love the results just like I am!</li>
    <li> Best high quality minoxidil solution available on the market with excellent penetration power into the scalp. Have been using this product for the last three years every morning and evening (both crone and front hairline) with visible results. It takes persistence to use it on a daily basis but results come with time. Also, I notice every day in the morning how healthy my hairs look when the lotion is applied the evening before. A must to use as part of an efficient hair loss prevention regimen.</li>
    <li> I have been using lipogaine twice a day for over a year.  I was skeptical about buying a hair regrowth product, but the results with lipogaine have been amazing.  Saw visible results within the first 2-3 months of use.</li>
    <li> I have used many topicals since 2000, but they have ranged from sticky, gummy, flaky, irritating, oily...you name it.  Lipogaine is the only one that once it&#x27;s on my scalp and dries, I forget that it is there.  I have used a well-known minoxidil product (spray/foam) with ZERO results.  I am pleased that this has been effective in preventative treatment, as I started seeing hair loss at age 19.  I am very happy with Lipogaine and will continue you to use it.</li>
    <li> The item may work. But too oily it does not fade like Rogaine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now, in combination with Rogaine and various natural shampoos and a biotin supplement. It&#x27;s hard to say if I&#x27;ve had actual &amp;#34;new growth&amp;#34;, and my thinning is definitely at the mid-beginning stages, but I can say that I have noticed that any progression of thinning seems to have been reduced since adding this product to my routine. There are so many variables in the fight against losing one&#x27;s hair it&#x27;s hard to say one thing will be a miracle fix for any one person - but I can say that this product is certainly worth testing in your arsenal and always have patience and test products for an average of 3 months. Good luck and I hope it works well for you!</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time, and is really easy to use. Just dab it on your head in places where you want it to work. The great thing about it versus generic minoxidil is that it dries a lot faster. Generic minoxidil can take at least an hour to really dry, while this will dry in 5 minutes or so. It&#x27;s a better product in the morning for when you need to head out, and you want to style your hair, which is really hard to do with generic minoxidil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three months and my hair loss is definitely stopping. No sign of regrowth yet but I&#x27;m giving it time. More effective than Rogaine.</li>
    <li> Product worked well to shape the hair and act like a product</li>
    <li> I have been using for almost 1 year now. It took about 4 months to start seeing results. I only use once a day , not twice as recommended. Honestly, everywhere that I placed drops consistently i have grown hair . It has also thickened the existing hair. It takes a good hour to hour and a half for product to dry completely.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping and it can be used as a hair gel.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several topical products for hair loss over the years and Lipogaine is the only one that works. When I started Lipogaine my hairline was receding and my hair was thinning on top. I was primarily concerned with stopping my receding hair line and Lipogaine did it. My hairline has pretty much stopped receding and my hair looks fuller and thicker as well. I use it twice daily once in the morning then in the evening. It dries quickly and does not my hair sticky.</li>
    <li> I have to agree that this product is very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t get in the way during the day or at night.  It can give you a cowlick, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about its effectiveness though.  I was losing my hair due to work related stress that had overworked the muscles in my forehead and constricted blood flow.  My hair naturally grew back once I I worked out the muscles around my head with deep tissue massage and cut down on work stress.</li>
    <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my father to start using Lipogaine. Wow. One bottle and his almost bald area started to grow hair on the lower back side and on the top, and after just two bottles I see a huge difference. It&#x27;s kinda scary as I thought he would never have hair there again but apparently it&#x27;s not genetic but something other, DHT or vitamins, stress etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, he&#x27;s so much happier that I found this and we are both growing our hair back! I&#x27;m impressed. We were going to do implants but they are not permanent and cost waaaay too much. The problem with implants is that if your issue is high DHT for example, implants will only be a temporary solution, the hair will fall weak to the DHT and fall out again and you have to pay for it again as no hair implant service does lifetime implants for one cost and they will not guarantee the implant will not fall out. They are only in the business for a temporary solution not a permanent one. Implants are only ideal if for example you are not eating right and you lost your hair and nothing else is the cause, and you start to eat correctly then implants may be a way to go. For now I rather do this with Lipogaine instead of paying a professional to determine what the cause of our hair loss is, and then pay more for implants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iv&#x27;e been losing hair on the back (vortex) for quite a few years and it&#x27;s very noticable. Iv&#x27;e taken vitamins and have been using Minoxidil for years and the best result was small fuzzy hairs, so small it&#x27;s almost no effect and a waist of money. After reading about Lipogaine and it&#x27;s ingredients, it made sense to have DHT blocker all in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After One bottle I saw a huge difference in one month, and I&#x27;m on the second bottle and the hairs are getting longer and longer. This stuff is amazing! If you are using Minoxidil at any percentage, stop now and use Lipogaine! I can&#x27;t thank Lipogaine for making this product as it&#x27;s one of a kind and it really does work and with no side effects or awful smells.  I will continue to use until all the hair is restored. Thank you for a wonderful product I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> This seems to work. I think it works better than the other minoxidil treatments BUT the price is very steep! I bought couple of bottles in July of this year and it was $25 per bottle. I guess it&#x27;s selling pretty well so they raised the price. It was a little expensive at $25 but tolerable. I can&#x27;t wait untill my new laser helmet arrives because this Lipogaine is getting way too pricey...it would cost $360/yr if bought every month.</li>
    <li> I like this Minoxidil supplement. Its quite a bit more expensive than Rogaine but Rogaine makes my head itch and this doesnt. I think the Azelaic acid to help with DHT is a good add on.</li>
    <li> My husband started using this product about six months ago, and so far he has seen good results. His hair was just starting to fall out and I would find his hair is all over our bed and pillows... It was driving me nuts! I ordered him three months of this product to see if it would work, and we could both tell by the end of the month three that there was a lot less hair loss.  I can&#x27;t testify to how this product may work when there is advanced hair loss, but for those of you who are just starting the hair loss process, I can say that this worked very well for my husband and I continue to order it on a monthly basis from Amazon now. I&#x27;ve watched him put it on, and it only takes him a few seconds to apply the product and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any offensive odor or anything gross or sticky about it. We are happy customers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year straight and I can say that I feel that it has prevented additional hair loss but I cannot say that I have seen any regrowth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it doesn&#x27;t do much. I have thinning hair, Ive had it for years now. It&#x27;s not worth the price at all. It&#x27;s always very greasy when applying to the hair. I hate this the most. It&#x27;s impossible to really style your hair, if it&#x27;s really long. It&#x27;s messy. It doesn&#x27;t smell at all though.    I&#x27;ve notice people complaining about itching scalp, I&#x27;ve had that problem too. I&#x27;m switching to Kirkland once I&#x27;m done with my bottles. I given it a fair shot, doesn&#x27;t re-grow hair like it claims. At least not for me.    I don&#x27;t see the point of paying so much money for something that doesn&#x27;t really work.    If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, I wouldn&#x27;t. Just buy rogaine or Kirkland, I doubt the results differ at all. The other ingredients don&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
    <li> Good product, works as described for me.  Don&#x27;t notice much hair in the drain anymore and believe this product helps you keep the hair you currently have.  Easy to apply, and drys within a couple minutes.  I&#x27;ve used this for over a year, and am quite happy.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Maybe I need to buy another bottle but I don&#x27;t see too much results other than slowing down hair loss. It&#x27;s a good product for perpetual use.</li>
    <li> Good Price, quick shipping, good packaging, would recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair loss is not very bad. I forgot exactly why I chose this product rather than others. It might be because it has more ingredients than other minoxidil. My hair is a lot thicker than before after using this product for 7 months. My only complaint is that I need to use the product every day.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every dollar, it is easy to apply and quick to dry! I am at the beginning stages of thinning hair not completely bald, not everyone is going to get bald. My dermatologist explain some people will just have severe thinning, so I tried for some months to reverse it and I have seen good results with it and hair growth, it needs some time to work. At first you experience some hair shedding because it is a sign of pushing out the hair so new ones become stronger and visible. I also use the micro needle to stimulate hair growth, it makes the lipogaine to work better given it a synergy effect. I try both and work for me, I apply in mourning and before bed.</li>
    <li> Great Product, stopped my hair from falling and even helped it grow! I reccomend this to all who have problems with balding and want to see real results. While most products I&#x27;ve used have irrated and swelled my skin, this is the only one that seems to do anything proactive for me. In just a few months I have really seen the difference, all I can really say is, THANK YOU lipogaine!</li>
    <li> I am giving time to see if it works; it&#x27;s the second bottle and I&#x27;m half way - so far nothing has changed, but I&#x27;ll give more time.</li>
    <li> I am a 40 year old mother of 3 boys. I am taking the Hair Covet vitamin  and very happy with it. My husband is not very happy with his frontal hair line. It receded a lot over the years. I bought this product  for him. He has used it for 5 months and result is fantastic! There is a lot of hair regrowth on the hair line. The only issue is that it seems that regrowth on two sides are not the same, one side is a lot of more than the other side. Right now, he is applying more Lipogaine on the side with less regrowth, hoping that will make the regrowth even on both sides. lol.</li>
    <li> I have tried Lipogaine for about 4 months, in the beginning at first two weeks I noticed slight fuzzy growth (as I have 10x Magnification Mirror.) After that no more progress. I am giving up on this product.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair all greasy, I use this for about 3 months I have not seen any difference what so ever!</li>
    <li> I used it for a while in combination with other products and saw results, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was because of this product.  When I stopped using it, I didn&#x27;t loose any hair.</li>
    <li> Just ok.  Way too many 1 review reviews for this.  No change from regular minox after several bottles. Its very sticky, takes forever to dry and even when you think its dry it will leave yellow stains on your pillow.  It might have been better back in the day, but they changed their formula somewhere around the beginning of 2013.  I will say it doesn&#x27;t have the itching problem that kirkland minox has, where I want to tear off my skin as if I was on meth.  Just think there are better cheaper alternatives out there.  I do like their Big 3 shampoo though.</li>
    <li> this has pretty good reviews, its well recommended. i got my lipogaine shipped quickly, damn regenepure hasnt even been shipped! after 1st application it doesnt hurt or itch. dries quickly and doesnt smell much. ill give it 6 months. if no improvement ill shave my head.</li>
    <li> I am a female, but have been using this for a month and a half and I have little sprigs of hair popping out everywhere.  I AM VERY PLEASED.  I used Kirkland&#x27;s minoxidil 10% for a while, but it was too harsh and gave me sores on my head.  I moved down to this strength and wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I am very excited about my results and fully intend to keep purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Lipogaine for over a year and a half and find it really works. My hairline started to recede a bit and I tried Rogaine at first, which caused immediate shedding, so I switched to Lipogaine and found there to be no shedding. My hairline stopped receding and after 6 months small hairs started to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of the product is that it clumps your hair together a little, but that might be part of why the hair doesn&#x27;t shed so easily.</li>
    <li> This product works. It&#x27;s awesome and really helps control and restore hair problems.</li>
    <li> Started Sep 2013...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first month or so, and occasionally still, I get some irritation on my scalp from this product. Dryness is an issue as well and so I use a scalp moisturizer every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lost hair in some weird spots on my head since using it, and grown some new hairs - not a lot - on the front hairline where no hairs were really visible before. They don&#x27;t do much for my hairline but they do a little. Like a 15% improvement. No idea how it is working on the rest of my head but in general, hair looks thinner to me since I started using it. Had I not seen the very slow regrowth in the front, I might have quit a while back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using Lipogaine twice a day, and now just once due to the shine/sticky factor of what it does to my head. I keep my hair very short or shaved so it&#x27;s easy to see results, and shine, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that this product has a tendency to cause &amp;#34;sheds&amp;#34; and so I am reluctant to dump it altogether until I&#x27;ve been on it for 1.5-2 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use nizoral, take one propecia pill per day, biotin and mix up the shampoos with Big 3, Nutroegena T-Gel, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 38...managed to keep my hair up until now, with only noticeable thinning starting in the last year or so...not terrible considering many in my family have no hair. But it looks like a transplant is in my immediate future. :(</li>
    <li> I was not convinced when I read that this product works on the entire scalp. I am a believer now after 6 months of using this product. Not only is the hair on the top of my scalp getting a lot fuller, but also the hair on the frontal is a lot thicker than before. What is interesting is that my beard seems also grow faster and thicker, which is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately 7 months now. I have noticed that it has maintained fullness and I have not suffered marked hair loss as I did before using this product. However, I have not experienced the regrowth that others have experienced which is unfortunate. Regardless, I would still recommend this product over generic Minoxidil because it appears that it did a better job of reducing the rate of hair loss.</li>
    <li> Exelent product. A+++</li>
    <li> I have been using lipogaine for almost a year, It is the only thing that really helped me without any secondary effects. I highly recommend this product. try it!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I go on you should understand that I&#x27;m skeptic. When I ordered my first bottle of this stuff I was all but convinced it was a hyped hoaxed. Now after 1&amp;1/2 bottles I&#x27;m starting to eat my words. At first I thought it was just my optimism with the positive reviews that led me to believe that I was seeing these new hairs sprout on my head... but soon after, no doubt, these hairs were just as thick as the ones always growing at the top of my head. I&#x27;m 21 years old and my mother&#x27;s side of the family led me to start balding early. I took action as soon as I saw this pattern hitting me. The balding started as a sort of left/right flank on both sides of my widows peak. When I started applying Lipogaine twice a day every day the hairline made a forceful pushback in a short amount of time. I don&#x27;t even need before and after pictures to see the difference its already made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only bits of advice that I heeded out of pure paranoia (not sure if there&#x27;s significance to them):&lt;br /&gt;1. If you have dandruff, keep it cleared out with a comb, shampoo or otherwise to make sure the chemicals reach the pores&lt;br /&gt;2. Leave plenty of time between application and sweating. The natural oils of the body will remove your purchase from your skin quite quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I look forward to my future results, and will update perhaps after another month and a half as I let my hair grow out a little bit.</li>
    <li> tried this item and all i go to say it created a lot of dandruff for me. also i cant really say it helped, because it made my hair really sticky. so most of the time i was pulling out my hair tryin to wash this product off. would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I was using 3% Minoxidil for Women from Perfect Image but was not satisfied with the result, ie.  I was noticing that there was lots of hair in the sink when I washed my hair.  My hair was also constantly shedding.  I changed to this product and have been very pleased with the result.  When I wash my hair now there is either no hair in the sink or just one or two and very little shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you will notice with these types of products (I used to use a similiar product which Amazon no longer offers) is that they leave a residue on your scalp and in your hair which, though invisible, still makes combing through dry hair problematic.  This can easily be resolved by using a Detangler spray or a plain water spray.  Not a problem though when you consider the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company does offer a 30-day money back guarantee but it can take up to 3 months before you notice a real difference.[[ASIN:B0037TM252 Lipogaine for Men: Minoxidil Enhanced with Azelaic Acid DHT Blocker, Biotin, Vitamin, Intensive Treatment &amp; Complete Solution for Hair Loss / Thinning (For Men Only Formula) 30 days money back Guarantee]]</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, easy to use, great result, definitely will buy again! Comes highly recommended and did not disappoint. Stopped shedding altogether.</li>
    <li> I read many descent review for this product and this is my first time using Lipogain, as of right now it&#x27;s hard to tell if this is working. Less shedding is indeed happening, but no regrowth happening. Only been one month so well see later in the future to find out this product capability of helping Male Pattern Baldness.</li>
    <li> May be its not for me. I used it only once and got redness and inflammation on the scalp skin where I applied it.</li>
    <li> I decided to take a risk and purchase this product for use on my receding hairline, despite mixed reviews from others who say that minoxidil-based products will not help a receding hairline (typically for the crown area only).  I began using it in June, 2012, and as of October, 2012 I have seen some minor results.  After about a month of use I experienced the minoxidil \\&quot;shedding.\\&quot;  If you are a potential buyer and are worried about this, please don&#x27;t be, it stopped after a couple weeks and left no visible thinning of hair in the process.  Afterwards, I began to notice some very fine \\&quot;peachfuzz\\&quot; growing in the areas where I have been applying the Lipogaine.  It has been a few more months since then, and although progress is very slow, it is still progress, and at the very least my hairline has stopped receding.  At the time of this review (October, 2012) there is some minor-moderate regrowth, but nothing substantial yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine gets 3 stars for being able to do this despite warnings to the contrary, it falls short of getting 4 or even 5 stars because the product is quite messy.  It leaves a sticky, and later a dry, crusty residue on the application site.  About an hour after applying it my hair feels like I applied a gel-based hair product.  If you do not scrub your scalp hard during a shower the residue can build up quickly, leaving a visible layer.  However, I have seen some results and would recommend at least trying it to see if it works for you.  One bottle seems to last me about 25 days if applied per the directions, and as I said, it has taken a few months to achieve visible results.  I will keep purchasing it and hoping for more substantial regrowth in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of June 2013:  I have since discontinued using this product in favor of Rogaine foam.  It appears to perform the same job with none of the messy residue.  No additional regrowth noticed over the past 12 months.</li>
    <li> It leaves hair oily and its impossible to use in the morning and be able to style hair and go out. I prefer the rogaine&lt;br /&gt;Foam.</li>
    <li> My husband was thinning at a heavy rate in the front and had tried other products without much success. Looking through Amazon, he found this product. It took him 1.5 bottles to start seeing the results he wanted so \\&quot;patience\\&quot; is key!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for almost 2 years, regrew most of the hair in the frontal area. For best results, combine it with Nizoral shampoo and Propecia (finasteride)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 and have been gradually thinning on the top and crown of my head for the past 20 years. I&#x27;m fortunate that I still have some growth all over my scalp and although it has thinned dramatically I&#x27;ve not reached the point of having completely bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for about 7 weeks and what I&#x27;ve noticed so far is that my scalp feels more healthy (no longer feels itchy), my hair is more manageable, I&#x27;m losing much less hair in the shower, and I&#x27;m finding very little hair on my pillow in the morning. I&#x27;m also starting to see some minor new growth along my hairline. I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past and Lipogaine is hands down the best I&#x27;ve used to-date. This product is easy to apply and dries in about 30-45 minutes leaving my hair easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had all but given up on trying to salvage what was left of my hair until my wife came across this product and encouraged me to give it a try because of all the favorable feedback. As I said, it&#x27;s only been about 7 weeks and too early to expect any major re-growth, but what I have seen makes me hopeful the best is yet to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence I encourage you to give it a try. I was skeptical but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance!</li>
    <li> (After more than 6 months of usage )This product works So good.&lt;br /&gt;it drys fast and has DHT blocker which is very helpful to prevent hair loss . you need to use it twice a day in order to get good results , i beleive this product is the best of 5% Minoxidil Enhanced with Azelaic Acid DHT Blocker that is on the market at this time ,from my wide experience of a many products i strongly recommend this one .&lt;br /&gt;i used to have 15% Minoxidil with Azelaic Acid DHT when it was available in the market , after it disappeared from market, i started to use Lipogaine 5% Minoxidil with Azelaic Acid DHT it gave me the same amazing results and maybe more while 5% is safer than 15% , now my hair is much more thicker and healthy .you just need to be patient , you not going to see result in one or two weeks , it takes time, sometimes up to 10 weeks to see  significant results and you will continue to see more and more enhancement by time .&lt;br /&gt; i strongly recommend Lipogaine for anyone experiencing regular OR severe hair loss, it works so good and in both front and top/vertex  thinning  areas .&lt;br /&gt;just be consistent and use it twice a day and you will notice amazing results .</li>
    <li> I found out about this product through a reliable source about 3 months ago, and since then I have had amazing results with hair thickness and fullness. I have used upto 5 different Minoxidil products over the long duration of my hair loss but no product works as well as Lipogaine for Men. I am absolutely hooked on Lipogaine and have already ordered in bulk supply.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 18 weeks so far.  At the same time, I started using it with biotin pills (10000 mcg) and Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo.  I have seen no new hair growth yet, but strangely, my existing hair seems a darker shade of brown than before.  I apply the Lipogaine  once before going to sleep in the evenings since I find the product sticky and makes my hair look greasy (so I prefer not using it during the day when I am out and about).  I plan to continue with this treatment for at least another 18 weeks and then evaluate whether there is enough improvement to warrant further use.</li>
    <li> My current regime:&lt;br /&gt;1mg 5% Generic Minoxidil (1 x day)&lt;br /&gt;1mg Lipogaine (1 x day)&lt;br /&gt;Dermaroller (2 x day)&lt;br /&gt;Nizoral (4 x week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying 1mg of Lipogaine to my scalp everyday for the past month and have yet to see results. I will try this regime out for 6 months to see if I get any results because I have heard many good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry much faster than regular 5% Minoxidil (Kirkland, Rogaine) and it also makes your hair feel sticky (as opposed to greasy). It takes about 3 minutes to dry versus 1-2 hour for regular Minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***If you want Minoxidil to absorb in your scalp faster, use a dermaroller! This is the one I use [[ASIN:B004LUZ956 1.0mm Micro Needle Roller Skin Care Therapy Dermatology System]]. Using a dermaroller will help Minoxidil absorb 10x faster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using lipogaine for 5 months and after that time i can definitely say this product has helped me with my thinning hair in front of my hair. When i started using i cut my hair very short so lipogaine could absorb more easily that time i was using twice a day morning and evening. After 6, 7 weeks i let my hair regrowth and i saw results. I had baby hair on the spots where i used to have little or no hair. Now im using lipogaine once a day since my hair is a little bit longer, i also notice that since using lipogaine i dont loose almost any hair while washing my hair. I recommend to take some pills taht have biotin and vitamins B, it works for me.</li>
    <li> This it is a great shampoo to use it if you need a solution in heair treatment to you hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been noticing that I was loosing hair for the past 5 years, I tough this was normal and not a big deal until 2 years ago, when I noticed that my front hairline was really thinning, especially at my temples. I panicked. I was still loosing hair and balding in the front really fast. I came across Lipogaine on Amazon and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I applied Lipogaine in my hair every morning after my shower, and every night before going to bed. The first thing I noticed was that my hair stop falling. I would run my hand through my hair after my shower and instead of seeing 5 or six strands between my fingers, now I saw nothing. After maybe one month of using the product, I noticed &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; growing in my hairline. 3 months later I noticed my hairline get thicker, as more and more &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; was growing in. I kept applying Lipogaine to my hairline and front religiously twice a day, and the results were slow but steady. This is the only product I use and I know it is responsible for the positive results. 2 years later I still apply it twice a day and my hair keeps on getting a little thicker. Nobody would now say that I am balding, when people commented how I was just 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;It works, it needs time and consistency I guess, but it does stop your hair from falling out, and promotes growth of new hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Probably the best minoxidil out there today.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this stuff does work.  I have been using it for a few years now and I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using lipogaine for a year now. My hair was thinning out to the point that you could see a bald spot. I did research and found reviews for this product and thought I might as well try it, I have nothing to lose (no pun intended). haha    So not only did my hair grow back, I was able to keep the hair that I already have. My hair looks full and I recommended it to all my friends with thinning hair. This is truly an amazing product that saved me from the embarrassment of thinning hair!!!    I have been ordering this from Amazon for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I have used several different hair restoratives over the years &amp; have found that Lipogaine helps my hair loss with a more complete formula than just the Minoxidil by itself. There are more than a dozen different active ingredients in the formula that have seemed to help my hairloss and from my own personal experience the hair that i have regained is of a thicker quality &amp; not the fine baby hair that other formulas have only helped me to grow. It is far superior to anything I have used in the past and believe you me I have spent many years &amp; 1000&#x27;s of $ on trying different hair regrowth products. It was worth putting Lipogaine to the test for me, I mean what did i have to lose or to gain.... more hair?</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now. So far I noticed my hair shed less compared than before and it looks thicker. So far I&#x27;ve been pleased with the result and will continue using the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Rogaine for 8 years now and wanted to try something with a bit more punch. I have been using lipogaine now for 2 months. I use it at night, since it&#x27;s incredibly sticky. I understand everytime you try something new, there&#x27;s a initial shedding phase. But I&#x27;m roughly 9 weeks in and am still shedding. Not sure what&#x27;s up...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helps stop hair loss and keeps my scalp from being oily I will continue to use it because nothing is better. Brian mcgowan</li>
    <li> Choose after I saw the stars on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone with thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;still haven&#x27;t had any sudden hair growth. Will keep trying!</li>
    <li> Lipogaine has changed my hair thickness tremendously . I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 months and the results are amazing . My family and friends are always complementing me on how great my hair looks . My hair was thinning really badly at the top and back before I started my lipo treatments . Thanks lipogaine for restoring my confidence. I recommend this product to anyone of thinning hair !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old and have been slowly losing my hair mostly in the temporal area.  However, in the last year thinning in the crown region.  After much research, I have chosen Lipogaine to hopefully combat this.  I have been using the product for two months and  applying it consistently in the morning and at night as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware like many reviews state I had a shedding period for about two months. It has finally slowed and hopefully it&#x27;s over.&lt;br /&gt;For several years, I have used gel in my hair.  However, now I have replaced the gel with this product.  It&#x27;s been perfect and taken the place of any other product I put in my hair.  It will make your hair appear a bit greasy, but dries within a few minutes. I have seen some new light fuzzy hair growing in my temporal region and it makes hair appear thicker!!!  I&#x27;m not expecting a miracle, but looks promising and combined with biotin and the correct diet I believe this product works.  I will give an update when I&#x27;m 6 months into use.</li>
    <li> No results with Lipogaine after 6 months (and 6 bottles).  In fact my hair is more thin after these 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine is a watery, yellow liquid that runs down my head/face/neck with use.  It is makes your hair sticky. I also used the Lipogaine shampoo. I feel I wasted my money on these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently trying a DHT blocking formula (NuHair Kit) and a DHT blocking shampoo.  After 1 month I feel better about my hair with NuHair</li>
    <li> Woth the price and most efficient than regular minoxidil which makes scalp dry and itchy.I have been using it for almost 8 months and got good results. I have got lot of compliments from my friends and also recommended this product to my friends too.</li>
    <li> One star lost because of high price and lack of listing of  Active Ingredients quantities. If Lipogaine wants to be credible it should list the quantities otherwise it falls into &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34; cathegory. What does it mean that Lipogaine contains Minoxidil (5%) - is it that unknown quantity of 5% Minoxidil was added or that 5% of the package is Minoxidil?&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the idea of having Minoxidil + Niacin + other suspects helpful in improving the chances of hair growth in one application is very tempting and worth while. I cannot report on efficacy yet.&lt;br /&gt;But note that 5% Minoxidil same size bottle costs as little as about $4 from Costco/Kirkland brand. Niacin is inexpensive too. For now Lipogaine price best effect is on its owner&#x27;s pocket.&lt;br /&gt; If I continue to afford it I would expect to see some results within first year.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine isn&#x27;t the cheaper of the Minoxidil products but it does have the elements I was looking for (a Vitamin A derivative and linoleic acid). I use it with a Spironolactone cream (S5), Pura D&#x27; Or hairloss shampoo, and a laser helmet 3 times a week. I can&#x27;t say definitively what is working but SOMETHING is. My bald spot in the back is completely gone and my temples are VERY slowly filling in. I had gotten to the point where I planned to just q-ball it forever...3 months in, Im now confidence enough to grow it out.</li>
    <li> I saw no gains after 3 months. Cause major irritation and redness. Also very sticky. Just not for me. Ill look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> read reviews and thought i would give it a try...so far im using it over a month exactly as directed ans nothing has happened...i have MPB but just patch starting in back.....nothing growing or getting thicker..exactly the same as it was 5 weeks ago,</li>
    <li> I was trying to stay away from the alcohol used in rogaine or kirkland and after reading reviews, they said this one didn&#x27;t have it. Well, I guess they changed their ingredients and they put it in there. So I had they same dry, itchy red scalp that I get with those other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give it a fair review only because I didn&#x27;t get to use it to it&#x27;s recommended full length.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for a few months now(just started my 3rd bottle) and I am very happy with the results. I apply it all over the top of my head and I have noticed a substantial improvement from before as my hair has gotten thicker. It&#x27;s definitely helping me keep the hair I have. My temples are filling in nicely as well. It dries pretty fast and there is no smell...a big plus. I will continue to use this product indefinitely.</li>
    <li> Dries fast and made noticeable change after the second bottle for me, with no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique is the price: 30$ a bottle is just too much. They should at least take that 5$ shipping cost off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing to see that they don&#x27;t offer free shipping for Prime account holders :(</li>
    <li> I have the beginning stages of frontal (horse shoe) balding and the classic male pattern loss of hair on the crown of the head. Additionally I had a prominent bald spot forming in the front middle portion of the \\&quot;horseshoe.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been a loyal Rogaine foam user for the last 5-6 years but after noticing that my hairline was still receding (slowly) I decided to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 months I noticed that the newly formed bald spot had thickened up and mostly grown back. My hair looks and feels thicker. I&#x27;ve actually had the confidence to grow my hair out a little more after about 3 months of using Lipogaine--which is really nice! The only downside is the price, one bottle goes quick. I use a little more than the recommended dosage (1mL) because I apply it on the back and front of my head, so one bottle winds up lasting me about 3 weeks instead of 1 month. The other negative aspect of Lipogaine is the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; effect it has on my hair. After applying the product my hair becomes rigid and fixed as if I applied a liberal amount of gel. This can be avoided by applying a dab of pomade a few minutes after the Lipogaine is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The take away: This is a good product that works. It&#x27;s a little expensive for the quantity, but the quality makes it worth it. Again, I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine for years, but I think the DHT blocker in Lipogaine was the extra umph I needed to stave off hairloss for the time being.</li>
    <li> I used Propecia for 6 months about 3 years ago and got the decrease libido side effects,pain in the testicles and worst of all gynecomastia which luckily was reversible. Just started Lipogaine thinking topical Azelaic acid would not have any systemic side effects. Unfortunately I had side effects due to minoxidil (puffy eyes,headache and shortness of breath). Also due to the 5 alpha reductase inhibition properties of Azelaic Acid my breast started growing.....So I had to stop it and go back to rogaine foam 5 %. So for those out there using it, keep an eye on your chest (gyno) and systemic side effects because even know its a topical it DOES GET ABSORBED into the bloodstream. I will probably retry topical spiro but not sure its as good as azelaic acid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 1 year. I&#x27;m not sure how much it has helped slow down the hair loss process, but I have yet to see any new growth. I believe I may just be one of the people that Minox is ineffective on.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak about if this product works or not yet because I have only been using it for a week now.  I will say though that it is like coating your head with super glue which I find somewhat discomforting</li>
    <li> I have been using lipogaine since may 2012 and I can confidently it has stopped my hair from falling out!  On top of that, my hair is much fuller and healthier looking!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for 6 months now.  This is the first product like this I&#x27;ve used. Using this along with black seed supplements has really pulled the brakes on my hair loss.  The only disadvantage - as is the case with all hair loss solutions - is once you stop using it, you loss the hair you saved or regrew.  Well worth the money though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other minoxidil treatments and so far this is the BOMB!! I was experiencing severe hair loss/thinning after trying others on the market without any success. I came across this item and though &#x27;wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try this, tried every other&#x27; didn&#x27;t expect the results I experienced. It&#x27;s well worth the price. I have been using this product for almost a year &amp; must say quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this product because the propylene glycol in liquid rogaine was driving me crazy. I thought that this product didn&#x27;t have it and a lot of the reviews said it wasn&#x27;t irritating and it dried much faster. so wrong! it dries at about the same rate as liquid rogaine and is just as itchy. Only difference is that the residue is easier to wash off. These reviews are too good to be true. If you&#x27;re looking for a less itchy alternative to liquid rogaine this isn&#x27;t the one! In the meantime can anyone reccomend a product that does NOT have propylene glycol? i haven&#x27;t had much luck finding one.</li>
    <li> My spouse has been using it for 6 months now. Lipogaine slowed down the hair loss, but did not completely solve it. Plan is to continue using it for another 6 months and see the rate of loss. No side effects or allergies. Added benefit: Good to style your hair and very easy to brush off if you don&#x27;t want any hold in hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time now. I did all the research I could when looking into getting a hair loss treatment. Lipogaine seemed to have the best reviews, and now I know why. I had tried other products before Lipogaine as well, but I was not a fan of the foamy application leaving your hair flaky and stiff. Lipogaine is easily applied and leaves behind no residue. And the best part? It works! Over the many months that I have used this product, in addition to their shampoo, I have noticed an overall reduction in hair loss as well as an improvement in hair health! Do yourself a favor, get Lipogaine!</li>
    <li> Makes my scalp it very badly! Used it only twice and tossed it.</li>
    <li> It seems like working, but it takes more than a few months to see a little grow. It is good to use with the Lipogaine shampoo.</li>
    <li> this product is crap. it made my hair look like dry hay after applying, i had horrible dandruff with this product, never had that with regular minoxidil. i also saw better results with generic minoxidil and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look as bad. this product also gave me an itchy scalp, again didn&#x27;t experience that with generic minoxidil. i believe there has to be a 30 day money back guarantee. i&#x27;ll try contacting them about that.</li>
    <li> I also felt chest pains with this and electric sensations in different parts of my body.  Sounds strange I know, but when I stopped using Lipogaine it went away. Stick to regular rogaine</li>
    <li> I used to use Minoxidil, and got decent results. But since I switched to this I think I can observe even better results. My hair loss has stopped completely. I don&#x27;t think my hair is any thicker, but the fact that it is still there is more than I expected, so really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for couple days, then my ears became itchy.  The skin became red, rough, along with white hairs growth.  Be aware when using this product.  make sure you are not allergy to Lipogaine.</li>
    <li> The smell is noxious. He wouldn&#x27;t even use it long enough to seeing it worked because he hated the texture and smell so intensely. Shame.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am very happy with this product. It started working about two weeks after using it. I put it on every two days in the evening then in the morning so i use much less than instructed but that works for me. Great product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve bought two bottles over the months and my hair doesn&#x27;t seem any better, if anything it seems worse. I would not bother wasting your money on this.</li>
    <li> Edit 8/9/15 : So I started using this product since July 2013 without missing one dose. And it did stop my hair falling out or perhaps it was slowed down. Because the one thing I have noticed my hair is still thinning and falling but  at a very slow rate. Nutrition and exercise help metabolism but will not block DHT which is the main problem.  Im 29 y/o and I have full head of hair. And I can only say if you are bald, this is not the right product for you. I give 5 stars because Lipogaine is the best product in the market at this moment.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles that came in really cheap packaging with one dispenser.  The contents easily could have been colored water-- didn&#x27;t notice growth nor extra loss.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 6 month supply and spent 1 month using it. For a review I will say is very sticky like glue, the itch is incredible high compared to regular minoxidil but the most annoying effect is dandruff and I will remark this lot of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;Results, well I will wait 6 months to evaluate if I can manage to surpass the annoyances.</li>
    <li> Hi All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just get straight to the point. I&#x27;m into my 3rd week of using Lipogaine after doing months of research on all the products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Method of use:&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply twice a day (1ml for day and 1ml for night) --&gt; Some days I&#x27;ve actually applied 0.75ml instead.&lt;br /&gt;2. I shampoo my hair every 2nd or 3rd day depending.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve used the dropper and applied it to areas on the top of my scalp and then simply tilted my head side/side, back/front so the solution is covering the surrounding areas.&lt;br /&gt;4. For my hairline, I&#x27;ve use my finger to rub some of the solution onto the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far:&lt;br /&gt;1. Dries very quickly&lt;br /&gt;2. The product is not sticky at all. If you&#x27;re finding it very sticky then you&#x27;re obviously applying too much onto the one area.&lt;br /&gt;3. I had significant dandruff in the first few days, it was very noticeable. Since then I&#x27;ve noticed hardly any dandruff. I&#x27;m not sure if it was because of the way I applied the product in the first week or whether the product has adapted to my scalp *shrugs*&lt;br /&gt;4. As expected, I noticed a lot of shedding as soon as I used the product. I&#x27;m into my 3rd week now, and over the last two days I think the shedding has slowed down somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;5. On the odd occasion, I did experience slight itching but not to the point where I had to scratch my scalp silly.&lt;br /&gt;6. Have yet to see any hair regrowth but i&#x27;m still way too early into the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am hoping for over the next few weeks or months:&lt;br /&gt;1. Some noticeable hair regrowth and thickness&lt;br /&gt;2. The shedding to either stop or significantly slow down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the product descriptions and reviews from various sources and how it is so far matching up to my own experiences, I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to update you all as I progress. Feel free to provide any tips or advice or comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WISH ME LUCK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace out!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this out since the minoxidil was causing some skin irritation on my head. I found using this seems to have reduce hair loss and have increased some re-growth of hair along the front. I&#x27;ll probably keep using it for another 4 months to see the cumulative effect of this.</li>
    <li> well this my review i had hi hopes on this one i have a lot of hair just thening in the front i started getting red  rashes itching and hives all over my body after 4 weeks of use and some minor chest pains, i stop using for 2 weeks and all my symptoms cleared up.and my scalp was driving me crazy itching,so no more use for me. guess i will have to try something else very disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this stuff grows hair, but it can be used as a substitute for crazy glue for sure!</li>
    <li> Review below is for the OLD FORMULA with Azelaic acid.  Started the review of the new formula at &#x27;Month ten.&#x27;  You can check out my progress below but bottom line- this stuff works.  Yes, it is expensive but did i mention it works?  This is far superior to Rogaine or any generic minoxidil. Some of the negative reviews seem to be from people that are not CONSISTENTLY using the product for six months or have an allergic reaction to minoxidil in general. If you&#x27;re not seeing some improvement after three months, sorry to say, you might be a lost cause.  Give it a shot!  Background- I&#x27;m probably at stage 3v on the handy &#x27;baldness&#x27; chart.  (noticeable loss in the back.  Have always had a high hairline but it&#x27;s getting higher every year). Family history- No male in my family has a decent hair line.  Not bald and nobody starts balding early but by 50yrs old there&#x27;s substantial loss.  This goes for both sides of my fam. Past hair loss treatments- I used minoxidil (generic) for about a year or more.  It worked very very well.  Saw some decent regrowth.  Was actually pretty happy with my hairline.  Had to stop because it was destroying my scalp.  Dandruff and heavy irritation.  After stopping, I pretty much lost all of the regrowth within about six months. Not willing to use finasteride.  Am currently using [[ASIN:B0032FSDOA Regenepure DR - Hair &amp; Scalp Treatment 8.0 fl. oz.]] and taking two [[ASIN:B0009EXLOO Nature&#x27;s Way Saw Palmetto, 60 Softgels]]every day in tandem with Lipogaine. Lipogaine usage- religiously applying two times a day or every 8hrs (some times I get three applications in a day). Overall thoughts on Lipogaine- really like the consistency of the liquid.  Nice and thick.  Really stays where you need it to.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all.  It does tend to make the hair a little &#x27;straw&#x27; like and &#x27;ashy&#x27;.  It is very very sticky if you apply to wet hair (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway).  As far as application and product quality it&#x27;s great.  That being said, styling your hair after applying is tricky.  As others have said it is very greasy.  This greasiness weighs down the hair and unfortunately can make you look balder. Have not experienced a shortage of supply during the month- using 1ml twice a day, one bottle made it to almost exactly a month.  Progress:  After two weeks- I&#x27;m in the dreaded &#x27;shedding&#x27; phase.  Ahhhhh!  It is truly horrifying.  The first week or so wasn&#x27;t so bad.  Then, almost two weeks to the day, it seems like it&#x27;s shedding all at once.  Apparently, some guys skip this phase altogether.  Apparently, I&#x27;m not one of those guys. I don&#x27;t remember it being this bad the last time I started Minoxidil but I may have emotionally blocked it out.  I feel like a tree in Fall time. I&#x27;ve taken to showering at night so I don&#x27;t have to see how much hair is going down the drain.  After showering, I fully expect to wipe the fog from the mirror and see a bald man starring back.  So, far he hasn&#x27;t showed up... yet. I try to visualize fresh new hairs sprouting under the ones that have fallen.  Visualization can only calm you down so much.  Thanks to reviews here and other forums, I am staying strong and keeping on.  Thank you, my balding brothers.  One month - still shedding.  Seems to have slowed a little but not much.  That being said, I&#x27;m also seeing some regrowth up front.  Small dark hairs combined with long darkish peach fuzz.  Looks like there could be some light regrowth around the crown but hard to tell right now.  The saga continues...  Six weeks- Shedding has slowed to a crawl.  Definitely seeing growth in the front.  Some of this is what I lost in &#x27;the shed&#x27; but there is a lot where hair hasn&#x27;t grown in a while.  Very very encouraging.  Back is still looking thin.  Will probably have to wait a few more months to see real noticeable results back there.  -Bumping the stars up to four today.  I&#x27;m lovin the Lipogaine right now.  Twelve Weeks - Bumping it up to five stars today.  Incredible results.  Have grown back all the hair lost in shedding and seeing more hair in places that hasn&#x27;t grown for years.  Pet peeve- ordered three more bottles and only got one applicator dropper.  Don&#x27;t know if they only include one for increments of three bottles (like Rogaine) or there&#x27;s only one dropper for all orders (regardless of the number of bottles).  Either way- for the amount of money you spend on this stuff, you should get a dropper per bottle (and somebody to apply it- but that&#x27;s beside the point).  Multiple dropper or no- this stuff is working great.  Hoping to look like Clark Kent in a few more months.  Four Months - Still going strong here.  For the first time in a long time, I&#x27;m confidant enough to go out with out a hat or hair concealer.  Basically, just waiting on the new hairs to grow more.  Sill could use a little work in the crown area (believe me, it&#x27;s night and day better than it was- just getting nit picky).  Don&#x27;t know how much better it can get.  At this point, I&#x27;m expecting my 16-year-old hairline to come back.  (That might be a little unrealistic).  Started using the [[ASIN:B004FT0ZJ8 Microneedle Skin Care System 1.0 mm Derma Roller with Medical Grade Stainless Steel]] before applying Lipogaine at night.  Seem to be getting a little peach fuzz on the edge of the hairline in front.  Not sure if this will turn into thick hair but it&#x27;s very encouraging.  Also, taking [[ASIN:B0009EXLOO Nature&#x27;s Way Saw Palmetto, 60 Softgels]] (one in the morning, one in the afternoon).  Hair loss in the shower basically stopped completely after taking the Saw Palmetto for a week.  Know these should be under separate reviews but in my opinion there is no one magic bullet.  You must have a multi-pronged battle plan if you want to defeat the evil Hair Loss Menace.  Five months - Today was the first day my barber noticed the hair progress.  He just kept going on and on about it.  &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe it!  You&#x27;re a success story.  I can comb your hair back.  This is incredible!&amp;#34;  Needless to say, it was a huge confidence boast. It also confirmed my own observations (I sound like a scientist).  I had thought my growth had plateaued but looking again I&#x27;m seeing a whole new line of hairs up front - some of that &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; turned into thick long hair.  I&#x27;m going to attribute this to that Microneedle.  Didn&#x27;t see those sprouts till I started using it.  Still would like to see some more growth in the crown area.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the growth up there is unbelievable-  I can conceal what&#x27;s missing without the use of product... Lipogaine&#x27;s got my hopes super high at this point.  Obviously, I&#x27;m in love with this product and wanna have like ten thousand of its babies but the results ARE incredible.  In less than six months I went from &amp;#34;balding old man&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;high-hairline young guy.&amp;#34;  I know I will never be &amp;#34;teenager with awesome hair&amp;#34; but &amp;#34;handsome man with good hair&amp;#34; will work for me.  -----------------------------------------------------NEW FORMULA Ten months - WHY WOULD YOU CHANGE THE FORMULA??!!!  Started shedding again!  Bleh!  Started almost immediately after started the new formula.  Not as intense as the first time around but still significant.  Dropped the rating down to three for the moment.  Things better improve.  ----------------------------------------------------UPDATE After 2nd shed, everything seems to be growing smoothly now.  Still feel the original formula was better.  Still the best on the market in terms of growing hair and not drying out your scalp.  I honestly can&#x27;t use some of the other products out there because they dry the scalp so much.  Continuing to use Lipogaine on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time in good shape. Did not work for me but then I did not try it for 6 months</li>
    <li> Very effective product if used on a daily basis. You do develop flaky white dandruff once it dries up.Something you have to put up with and keep it off. I have grown more hair which otherwise was receding at a rapid pace. Its a solution as long as you use it. 4 stars owing to the white flakes one has to put up with</li>
    <li> When I purchased this I guess I thought it would be bigger but to my surprise once it was used I understood why it was not.You do not need a bunch of this stuff to work.I had my fiance try it out on his hair and in no time he had new hair sprouts growing in his scalp.It comes with a dropper and you use 1ml  applied directly to hair loss area twice daily for the best results. It says right on the bottle that this is an intensive treatment for thinning hair which means it&#x27;s powerful stuff! I recommend this stuff because I know it works!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
    <li> A+.  stuff works great and have been using for over 3 years</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for a couple of months now and im satisfied with the results so far. It&#x27;s alot thicker in front and slowly coming in on top. Not as fast as i would like but it&#x27;s a start. I only apply once a day due to my work schedule and works well with just that. Ill continue to use this product and hopefully ill see more results.</li>
    <li> I have been a Lipogaine customer for quite some time now. My connection started after several different product searches to deal with increasingly thinning hair with emerging male pattern baldness. The trials were almost too numerous to mention although, most recently they were generic &amp;#34;Rogaine&amp;#34; type solutions. All were less than satisfactory and the thinning continued. Then, I noticed Lipogaine, with some interesting incremental and very good results over the first two months. My hair stopped thinning and areas surrounding the rear balding area began to see a thickening of hair, as did all areas of side and rear hair. For the front, thinning stopped but the replacement was not as robust. These results were way more than I expected and I have continued use of Lipogaine over the past several years, completely satisfied that it is both reliable and has consistent quality. I highly recommend Lipogaine to those of you who are wandering the hair care landscape. Use is with a mild or organic hair shampoo. For grooming, a mild hair product like Master Wellcomb will do or something similar.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product which I have been using for a few months and the results have been great. Works very well without the itching and irritation I had with Rogaine. Goes on quickly and dries leaving the hair easy to comb without looking greasy. It has helped me to maintain what I have as well as grow new hair. Highly recommended if you are challenged up top and hair is becoming sparse.</li>
    <li> Hey everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a few bottles from here starting this year. This product is isn&#x27;t any different from the other products in the marketplace. It does work to some effect, but honestly you can have the same effects from using generic minoxidil. Don&#x27;t bother wasting $30 every month, buy generic 5% minoxidil (Kirkland from Cost Co or Walmart&#x27;s Equate 5% extra strength minoxidil). Then buy a micro needle from ebay (got mine for $16) and buy some 5% azelaic  acid (DHT inhibitor) online or in store. I first run the micro needle on my scalp and then apply the minoxidil and azelaic acid. I&#x27;ve been doing this for about 4 months now and I&#x27;m experiencing AWESOME regrowth on my scalp and saving a lots of money!!. I&#x27;m using the Kirkland generic 5% minoxidil brand, which costs me $26 for a 6 month supply. I have also come to the conclusion, most of these reviews are fake and misleading.As most of the reviewers on here have only posted once and about this product only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has questions about how I apply my minoxidil or any other tips on hair regrowth, feel free to email at smoothkhera87@gmail.com and would be more than happy to respond to your emails.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and have a great day everyone</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine since November 2012 after hearing about it on the \\&quot;Hairlossfromsteroids.com\\&quot; website. This review is only to address my opinion of Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I believe Lipogaine significantly reduces hair loss. I still have some shedding from shampooing in the shower/bath. But when I put gel and style my hair, I really don&#x27;t notice much shedding at all, as compared to in 2001 when I was 20 and really noticed significant shedding when styling my hair. I think this product works better the more frequently it is on the scalp. I cannot attest to any regrowth to Lipogaine as I had a hair transplant several months prior to using Lipogaine. In my opinion, Lipogaine is the best 1st mechanism of defense towards androgenic alopecia, especially for young guys in high school/college that are just beginning to loose their hair. The reason I believe this is because I think the azelaic acid kills DHT, and having it penetrated into the scalp for extended periods of time kills more DHT than any of the ketoconazole shampoos that are also clinically proven to kill DHT. I have never used any other minoxadil formula, so I can&#x27;t compare it to Rogaine or any other generic minoxadil. With all products there is usually a downside.... and maybe I just have higher, or even unrealistic expectations of products than other people. But Lipogaine does leave a sticky substance feel even when it is dried, and when I put gel in after the Lipogaine, it just doesn&#x27;t blend well with the Lipogain and kinda leaves residue of white balls/dots throughout my hair. However, I still think using it once a day, maybe before bed or any time you are going to be at home for even a couple hours Lipogaine can be beneficial to reducing hairloss. I will continue using Lipogaine until a better product comes around. Also, Lipogain puts in a lot of other ingredients I am not convinced work such as saw palmetto, niacin, biotin, vitamin b6 and B12, and some other crap that I personally think if leftout might help the styling aspect and decrease the sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two years now.  While it hasn&#x27;t restored all of my hair, it has definitely prevented any further hair loss.  Plus my hair does seem a bit thicker... I recommend trying it out for six months.  What do you have to lose! Hopefully no more hair!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item and have been continuously been doing so for over three months. Morning and evening, apply it.  Bottom line: No improvement at all and I envy those who claims that it does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really balding... at all. Basically, I&#x27;m very self conscious about my hair and appearance. I&#x27;ve almost always had a &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; spot on my crown, since I was 18, but it&#x27;s thinning is VERY slow. In the last few years my hairline in the front has receded to a noticeable level. So, I thought I&#x27;d give this product a shot.... better start earlier than later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last summer I bought a bottle of Lipogaine after reading the reviews. I was very irresponsible in the consistency of using the product, didn&#x27;t see any results after a month, so i put it to rest. Over the holidays, I became more self conscious about my appearance and decided to give it a more serious try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using it on a strict schedule, once in the morning, once before bed, and 5 months later I have new hair growing on the receded areas of my forehead. Also, my forever thinning crown doesn&#x27;t look thin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works! That being said, I  think the only working ingredient for regrowth is minoxidil and you can get it in many other products, but Lipogaine also has other ingredients that help block DHT. It seems to be the best formula. I also have a bottle of Bosley, and it goes on clearer with a less pungent smell or stickiness. I like to use it when I want to avoid those two attributes and from the reviews it seems to also work work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> Lipogaine is part of an industry that is well known to over promise and under deliver. And I imagine because of that it&#x27;s hard to stand out from the pack. But, for me, Lipogaine has delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had relatively fine hair but a lot of it. It started to thin a bit in my early 40&#x27;s, along with a receding hairline, and I decided to do something about it. For me it was a doctor prescribed combination of Minoxidal and Propecia and I saw results. But after about a year I started paying attention to the side effects that were becoming more well known and was having a hard time justifying the cost. Eventually, when I stopped, the gains I had seen diminished and I found my hat collection growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a very active person and just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with my hair not &#x27;matching&#x27; the way I felt. So I started looking around and discovered Lipogaine. There&#x27;s no question that the number of positive reviews here on Amazon helped me pull the trigger but, in all honesty, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle. I figured I&#x27;d try it for three months and take it from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it hasn&#x27;t been an overnight miracle I can say that, without a doubt, my hair is thicker than when I started the process about six months ago. My main focus now is to see if I can inch my hairline down a bit. I&#x27;ve seen enough success there to stick with it and am confident that it will continue to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while it might be different for some, I&#x27;ve found that the solution itself dries quickly and actually seems to add a little body on its own. Super fast and easy to apply and it&#x27;s simple to work in to your normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that with products like this it may work for some and not for others. But if you&#x27;re on the fence I&#x27;d highly suggest giving it a shot. And maybe one of your buddies who you haven&#x27;t seen in a while might also say, &amp;#34;Hey dude. Nice haircut.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah...it&#x27;s the haircut. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Excellent, fast delivery too!)</li>
    <li> I have used Lipogaine for about two years. Overall I am quite happy with the results.  The first year I used the product only at night and was also taking Propecia.  However, I wanted to stop taking Propecia due to adverse side effects.  So for the last year I stopped taking Propecia and have been applying Lipogaine morning and night.  While I have seen some regrowth of hair, my main concern was to stop further hair loss and the product seems to have done that. I have used Minoxidil in the past and for me Lipogaine is definitely a superior product. My only minor complaint about the product is that it is somewhat oily going on. So you have to be careful applying it in the morning for styling reasons and you have to be sure to apply it at least an hour before going to bed so that it is dry and you don&#x27;t get it on your pillows. It works for me so I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, much better than the Costco brand and very reasonably priced, it contains other important extra ingredients that are good for your hair, the regular minoxidil solution don&#x27;t have these. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 year. Whereas I have not seen new hair being regenerated, it has definitely slowed down the thinning. I have had no side-effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over the last two years and it works for me. While I do have new hair growth, I also have stopped losing hair which is more important to me.  I know it&#x27;s working because I have hair growth where the product has dripped from application in addition to where I want it to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Rogaine user for twenty years, so not my first experience.  Also, I have no side effects which I had using some other products - namely light rashes and sensitive skin where applied.</li>
    <li> Best solution I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;Best solution I&#x27;ve found to stop hair loss and regrow hair. This cocktail of ingredients along with the great price make this product the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of months and can testify that the product works and has been effective in maintaining hair at the crown. Experienced some regrowth as well. Really happy.</li>
    <li> I am 50 and have tried everything from the Helsinki formula of the 80s, Rogaine, and even a formula from Brazil. Nothing works on hereditary baldness. Do not waste your money on stuff like this, they sell false hope.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over a year now, and I have seen great improvements in hair thickness in every single one of my problem areas. I started losing my hair at 18, so thin hair is not the norm. I&#x27;m 24 now, and unless I tell people about my hair loss they don&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Lipogaine</li>
    <li> I have been using a different product for sometime and when it was taken off market, I worried greatly about finding a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I finally settled on Lipogaine . Now that I have been using it for well over a year , I can actually say that I am glad that I made the switch. I was simply hoping to stop the hair loss. I was pleasantly surprise, actually shocked when I inadvertently saw the crown of my head in the gym mirror. It was indeed a shocker to see it filled with hair with almost no bald spot detectable! I had previous transplants in the front with some plugs still detectable to the trained eye, but now , hair grew in between and the look is totally natural. Needless to say, new hair loss totally ceased !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year now.  I have seen a definite improvement in my hair.  It does take about 2 months before you can start to see a big difference.  The only draw back is that it makes your hair &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; after it&#x27;s applied.  I have used Rogaine from other makers and feel Lipogaine works the best.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine works! I was starting to notice diffuse thinning on the top of my head, which was getting more obvious by the day. I decided to get serious about my hair loss, and began reading everything I could find that might help with regrowing hair. After reading positive reviews about Lipogaine and checking the ingredients, I figured that I had nothing to lose but more hair so why not get started. Well, it&#x27;s been a little over a year now and I am seeing results that exceeded all my expectations. I have seen new hair growing where I have not seen any in twenty years! My wife and my barber both noticed improvement, and my friends say I &amp;#34;look younger&amp;#34; which makes me feel great. I have more confidence in my appearance in social situations, I feel like a new man. There is a lot of snake oil and misinformation out there when it comes to hair loss and regrowth. If you&#x27;re willing to make the commitment as I have, Lipogaine will deliver results.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Been using this product for almost 4 months. My barber is now asking where did this new growth come from. Still have a ways to go, but this along with Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Hair Maxx have revived, multiplied, and thickened the troubled area. Will continue!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for like a month, it definately not a miracle drug, and its definately not going to grow hairs on your head like weeds, but one thing I&#x27;m sure is it works, at least for me. I purposely put them on my completely bald frontal area to see if hair grows back, because this stuff is pretty expensive, I want to make sure it works. After about a month and a half of applying, I can see some very tiny hair growing on those spots, I dont know if they&#x27;re gonna get stronger or not but that has to wait a little longer to find out. The applying of the solution is a little messy since it is in liquid form, and mild itchiness or irritation might occur. On that aspect I think Rogine did a better job (used Rogaine for 5 years). But if you&#x27;re just looking for something that can keep or regrow your hair like me, I dont think you would mind. Anyhow, the choice is yours, just wanted to share my experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month now in combo with Hairomega Supplements.  I still have not noticed any regrowth in my hair. I have noticed VERY minimal slowing down of hair loss, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to take advice from previous customers and try the product for a few more months.  I will update again in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects.&lt;br /&gt;Drys real quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Using 1mL/day does not equal a one month supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fear:&lt;br /&gt;What the one star guy said; hope it&#x27;s not a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Minoxidil works, what Lipogaine has that others don&#x27;t (and you notice the difference) are all the other added nutrients found to also help improve hair regrowth. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with laser treatments. So far, it has helped negate hair loss for me. I would definitely recommend Lipogaine to anyone suffering from hair loss... as it may work you too!</li>
    <li> Great for receding hair</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL FOR A 5% SOLUTION.MUCH BETTER THAN ROGAINE SOLD IN DRUGSTORES.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR PEOPLE  USING 5% MINOXIDIL SOLUTION.THE ADDITION OF AZALEIC ACID MAKES THIS PRODUCT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN ADDITION, LIPOGAINE 5% SOLUTION IMPROVES THE CONDITION OF YOUR SCALP, WHILE OTHER MINOXIDIL PRODUCTS OFTEN RESULT IN ITCHING, DRY AND PEELING SCALP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND A VERY GOOD VALUE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RICHARD IN SF[[ASIN:B0037TM252 Lipogaine for Men: Intensive Treatment &amp; Complete Solution for Hair Loss / Thinning (For Men Only Formula, 2oz, one month supply)]]</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Have used for about two years with no complaints. Works well to maintain what hair you have. Caused me no irritation or discomfort. Only downside is I cant style my hair when using this product.</li>
    <li> It just makes your hair look thicker. But as you wash your hair, you see that it is the same. So far only Propecia really works for me.</li>
    <li> i purchased two bottles,first 2 weeks was ok,when i get to my 3 and 4 week,my hair where i put the product,is look like i start losing even more hair day by day,is start look like she.t,so i get frustrated and went to the haircutter and shaving everything completely.Lipogaine contain the minoxidil and minoxidil can give you the shedding!?,speciali on the beginnen?,hoops is true.Is only one product i founded have so many positive review!i on my second bottle hoops i see some results in 3 more weeks,if yes i order 2-3 more bottle!!</li>
    <li> I tried using Rogaine as well as a well-known drugstore brand, but they caused a lot of irritation to my sensitive scalp.  For the past year I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine and have had not issues with the redness and tenderness I experienced with the other brands.  I&#x27;ve found it to be very effective.  I used it twice a day, six days a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on month 12 of using Lipogaine, and it has without a doubt worked for me.  Took about 3 months to see a noticeable difference, and now I&#x27;ve *dramatically* lessened the amount of XFusion (similar to Toppik hair fibers) I use.  The addition of known &amp;#34;hair health&amp;#34; ingredients like Biotin and Saw Palmetto are a big plus.  Combined with a regimen of herbs that block DHT, I have regrown a good amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a perfect solution -- you have to use it religiously AND continuously to receive the effects, but the same goes for any minoxidil-based formula.  I&#x27;m not comfortable with having to use this long-term, but for now I still care enough about having hair that this works.  Ha.  Another downside is a slightly greasy residue.  But hey, it grew my hair back and accomplished the goal.</li>
    <li> purchased for my husband. It really works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Rogaine for a few years. Hair stopped failing a little bit, but it was not my expectation. I stopped using Rogaine and decided to using Lipogaine. I loved the fact that it includes biotin and DHT blocker. My hair failing stopped totally and there is sign of hair regrowth. I love this product more than any other hair product and I used to try a lot of treatment but non of them was my expectation except this one. I use Lipogaine twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a product that has significantly improved my quality of hair. If you are curious, I would buy a bottle, try it everyday and see if you see any benefit, as probably not everyone responds to it. It has worked for me, luckily.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for last six months. I clearly see a big difference. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Lipogaine for Men is amazing, my barber in now trimming hair on top of my scalp. Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, I will never have a full head of hair again but my shiny scalp is starting to become dull. There is hair growing over my entire scalp. Only time will tell as to how much and long the hair will become. I have tried the other products but NONE have given me this results. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this prodcut.</li>
    <li> I finished my first bottle without any problems, I even think it made my hairline thicker. After beginning my second bottle I began noticing horrible red bags under my eyes and red inflamed ears. Everyone kept asking if a was in a fight! Also I noticed a loss in libido. I stopped use immediately.</li>
    <li> I started using other products  I was complaining to a friend about my hair being dry because of them. He mentioned Lipogaine, he hasn&#x27;t had any issues.  I tried it and I have not looked back.  My hair is longer on top and the liquid seems to get to the base better without making my hair dry.  I only gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t want any company to think that&#x27;s good enough.  Hair loss sucks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now and I know that I don&#x27;t seem to be losing any hair anymore but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m growing any new hair ethier.  It definitely seems to be helping though and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Have used this for several months and the ease of application is far superior than other brands.  Can definitely tell a difference using this product, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for sometime now and I believe it is working....I&#x27;m excited.  Just recently ordered another 90 day supply.  I am using this product along with the Regenepure shampoo and Hollywood Beauty Carrot Creme hair product and I am seeing great results.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works a little better than the regular cheap 5%.  I&#x27;ve used 15% minoxidil and that was the best but unfortunately the USDA forced all those products off the market.  So now this is the best option.  It also gives my hair almost like a hair spray feel to it once it dries and I kinda like that, it&#x27;s better than just the regular oily feel that the other products have. It&#x27;s also a little more gentle on your scalp, avoiding rash and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price!  It&#x27;s very expensive compared to everything else. One month supply of this is higher priced than a 6 month supply of generic 5% minox.&lt;br /&gt;As with all minoxidil products you HAVE to use it 2x&#x27;s a day every day, or it simply does not work. Some days I use it 3x&#x27;s a day too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Works as advertised and I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it was more reasonably priced. It&#x27;s up to you if you think it&#x27;s worth 6x&#x27;s the price of the regular stuff though, and if you already take finasteride that answer might actually be no.</li>
    <li> The hair on top of my head is coming in noticeably thicker and darker, and growing faster. Been using it for 1 month, hope to see more improvement over time. I&#x27;m using it w some supplements like biosil, saw palmetto. Got a micro needle roller too, 1-2 times a week I use it before application. Fight the fight fellas!</li>
    <li> I ordered this stuff and wow, what a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this stuff is soooooooo oily. When you use the dropper to apply it, the stuff runs down your scalp so quickly onto your face. It&#x27;s a mess...It doesn&#x27;t spread very well either. You have to use A TON of the product just to apply the whole surface area of your scalp. By the time you are done, you have have one big greasy head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the FOAM and wow, what a difference. And save a lot of $$$ too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see why anyone would prefer this oil to a foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff reminds me off way oil from machine shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodluck!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now, and I have noticed a difference. My hair has definitely gotten fuller. I would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> When rogaine stopped working for me, I switched to this. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> From what I understand, it&#x27;s a lot less messy than the Rogaine and generic minoxidil liquid, which I won&#x27;t even consider using. It dries fast, isn&#x27;t too difficult to apply, and appears to have even higher-quality ingredients than brand name Rogaine and generic minoxidil products.    One downside is that you can only really cover part of your scalp each time. It runs down your head in more or less a straight line. I suppose this all adds up over time to result in regrowth (ideally) or slowed hair loss. Psychologically, I&#x27;d prefer to cover my entire scalp each time. The minoxidil foam I&#x27;m using now instead (mainly to save money) covers my entire scalp easily (if I use more than the recommended cap-full, that is). Unfortunately, a lot of it also gets caught in your hair if you try to cover your entire head. Otherwise, I end up having the same problem as I do with the Lipogaine. You&#x27;re supposed to part your hair when using the foam to give better access to the scalp. I guess that means they&#x27;re a draw in that regard.    Four stars because of the price and the aforementioned difficulty in covering the scalp. It doesn&#x27;t mess up my hair that much, so that&#x27;s cool. But the foam minoxidil gives it nice volume and makes it look a little messy (in a stylish way). I suppose I could always just put the Lipogaine on first and then use mousse instead.</li>
    <li> Figured I would try something new... No results. More greasy than rogaine and takes longer to dry. Unfortunately no signs of any regrowth or less shedding.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Okay it might be a great thing, what I know is that possible side effects might be some premature facial skin and dizzyness...I experienced both, even though I&#x27;ve been off the thing for a couple of days now and I still experience it. I stopped using it for an undetermined period of time now, I will see later.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a couple of months and I found it oily and hard to apply evenly with eyedropper.&lt;br /&gt;Liked Rogaine Foam and Maxogain better as they are easier to apply</li>
    <li> 1st, foam doesn&#x27;t work for me because my hair is too thin to style.  I love Lipogaine because it&#x27;s easier to apply than liquid Rogaine.  It&#x27;s not as runny and thus doesn&#x27;t just poor down my head when I&#x27;m trying to use it.  In fact I kind of do light squeezes all over leaving just tiny bits on the scalp allowing me not to have to rub it in or soak my hair.  The end result is I don&#x27;t end up having to rewash my hair and thus don&#x27;t have to wait 30 minutes for the Rogaine to soak in before I can even rewash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd, Scalp Itch and dandruff are a side effect of the DHT experience for me.  When I took Rogaine or Propecia the itch always went away.  This product too has removed the itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m losing hair still or if I&#x27;m growing hair back, my hair is naturally thin so it&#x27;s difficult to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted than it&#x27;s commonly beleived that a DHT blocker is good along with rogaine(minoxidil), this product contains a DHT Blocker.  Last I knew, how Rogaine works is not well understood so the view of a Blocker&#x27;s importance is just a matter of trial and error from folks on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally found Lipogaine on youtube by some guy with the handle hairlossfromsteroids or something like that.  The guy definitely wasn&#x27;t a scientist but his videos make sense, steroid induced hairloss.  If you beleive him he has some good pictures showing how bad his hair loss got and his huge recovery.  Keep in mind his hair loss was chemically induced so his huge recovery is not the same as recovering from years of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning for Propecia and maybe other oral DHT Blocker users - Plain and simple, it turns out that while Testosteone is the male hormone for some parts of the body, DHT is the male hormone for others.  The result is that people have reported many of the same side effects as other drugs that effect DHT levels (like steroids) including weight gain and erectile dysfunction.  I struggled with weight gain and Erectile Dysfunction for years.  Someone mentioned a 60 minutes episode detailing Propecia as a verified casue of ED and possibly other health issues.  While I knew \\&quot;mild\\&quot; erectile dysfuntion side effects were possible with propecia I was told that they were \\&quot;mild\\&quot;, \\&quot;uncommon\\&quot;, and \\&quot;usually went away over time\\&quot;.  In fact there were times when I missed my pills for a week and saw no change.  My family doctor said maybe it was because I was now 30 and carrying some extra weight.  My urologist told me it was psychological because the Viagra he had me try worked thus showing that my plumbing was good.  Long story short, two months after I stopped taking Propecia my Erectlye Dysfunction is FINALLY gone and I&#x27;m losing  almost a pound a week without changing my habits.  I&#x27;m still having symptoms commonly attributable to a shrunken Prostate so guys I recommend staying clear of Propecia.  At the least, if you are considering Propecia, I recommend doing a Google Search on \\&quot;Propecia Side Effects\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I am going to give Lipogaine 5 stars even though I have been only using it little over a week now because I can certainly say it is the best Minoxidil I have tried so far. I notice it has no smell and drys in 5 to 10 minutes and it isn&#x27;t oily like the Kirkland brand of Minoxidil. What I like most is all the helpful ingredients in this Minoxidil brand, especially the azelaic acid which blocks both kinds of DHT. One thing I did notice for me is a light stinging sensation for a few minutes after I put Lipogaine on. It does go away quickly without causing any kind of irritation on the scalp. I will update this review in a few months once I see results from Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*  03/26/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Lipogaine for almost 3 months now and I am so far happy with the results I see so far. My hairs are starting to slowly get thicker in the hairline and I&#x27;m also seeing peach fuzz growth on my temples. The thin hair on the top back of my head is also starting to show it is getting thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use [[ASIN:B0032FSDOA Regenepure DR - Hair &amp; Scalp Treatment 8.0 fl. oz.]] everyday or at least every other day which I leave in for 10 minutes which has Ketoconazole in it and proven to inhibit DHT. Make sure you follow with a conditioner if your hair becomes too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* 08/27/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Lipogaine for 8 months I can see a difference, not a whole lot, but my hair has become thicker. I still give this product 5 stars because drys quickly which is a huge improvement over the cheaper minoxidil brands which take an hour or more to dry. When I ordered another month supply of Lipogaine it came in a nice box, but I also noticed that is doesn&#x27;t say azelaic acid on the ingredients. Instead it says DHT blocker proprietary blend with azetinol. From what I hear it is still in Lipogaine which is azetinol, but others are saying it is not. I have no complaints about Lipogaine and will continue to use it, hopefully I will see more results after being on it for a year.</li>
    <li> IMHO the results are better compare to standard minoxidil and the price is just got increased, additional USD5? C&#x27;mon you guys can do better than this</li>
    <li> I like it and it works better then plain minoxidil from Costco. But Costco is 17.$ for 6 of these. Not sure if it is worth the additional money. But if money is not an issue with you then it seems to work a little better then regular minoxidil. One thing I do like about this is (if your over 35 and dye your hair) it does not strip the dye out like regular minoxidil does.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice daily for 3 years now. I switched from Rogaine after reading some of the reviews. It is by far the most effective hair treatment I&#x27;ve tried. It has stopped my hair loss and even managed to grow a little of it back. It&#x27;s not a miracle treatment, but if you follow the 2x/day regimen, and minodoxil works for you (it does for most people), that combined with its DHT blockers put this at the top of its class.</li>
    <li> Big fan of lipogaine!!!! I have tried a couple of products for a while and was not happy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I saw the positive review of it and gave a try almost 2yrs ago and keep using till now. What a phenomenal result!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now I am buying it every 3month from amazon and even I do keep pictures of my hair for the records.&lt;br /&gt;Even friends and families are asking what I am using as the result is very noticeable. The only worry that I have&lt;br /&gt;is the side effect it might have if I keep using for the coming years. But I dont think I will stop using it unless&lt;br /&gt;some magic products pops up. I recommend for so many folks around me and still do same.</li>
    <li> Great price! There are very good results. Even a hair that was by itself now has others surrounding it. Worked within the 1st 3 weeks. I bought a 2nd bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is oily around where you put it, but it is not a thick grease, it dries up after a while. I have gone out with it. It is not noticeable or embarrassing.</li>
    <li> After partial balding I lost my confidence.  Guess what this actually works my hair grew thicker and longer than ever before. Now I can actually feel more proud of the way I look and not have to constantly wear a hoodie/cap. I recommend this over prescriptions or random things that are over the counter.</li>
    <li> Time will tell I guess</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than a year and have noticed that my hair loss (temple area) has diminished significantly -based on two applications daily. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I would recommend testing when to apply it to your hair - wet or dry. Personally, I apply it when my hair is still slightly damp for best results, but that might not be the case of everyone. All is all, it&#x27;s a product that works!</li>
    <li> I cant use this during the day because it makes my hair super greasy and dirty looking. I use it at night before bed.</li>
    <li> I feel that my hairloss was accelerated using this product, not slowed down or regenerated.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a yellow liquid that dries yellow, not clear, and makes the applied area look like you have jaundice or some similar skin problem.</li>
    <li> Used two bottles of this product over several months and NOTHING. Total rip-off!  Dont know why people says it works. It doesnt. Not only that, it TAKES FOREVER TO DRY.  Ive used other products before like this and this is the worst.  Save you money and buy minoxidil 6 month supply for the same price from costco or online.</li>
    <li> After using Rogaine for about 15 years, I came to a sad conclusion of the inevitability of ending up hairless. Most recently I inquired hair transplant procedures, but somewhat was discouraged by its high cost. In my endless search for hair loss cure, a friend recommended Lipogaine about 3 month ago which I subsequently ordered from Amazon. Based on  picture comparison, I am happy to report Lipogaine did help me in recovering all the loss hair I had in the last 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine is a truly an amazing product that need to be marketed on national level to help those who are threatened by hair loss. I recommend this product without any hesitation because it works like no other product on the market</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for last 4 months and I see improvements in hair growth. I can clearly see that the hair is growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair has been growing consistently for last 4 months in small amounts, though not sure whether the hair will grow in bigger amounts, if I continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this for me and have been using lipogaine for approximately 6 months, I love this product, it works,stops the hair from falling out and after 2 months the hair is thicker. I truly believe it&#x27;s the products that are in the lipogaine that make the difference. The minoxidil works alone but lipogaine has added certain other products in lipogaine that boost the results. Give it a chance it works.</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair as a young man at the age of 25, and have been battling thinning at the temples, which is normally regarded as either hard to combat or just plain impossible. I&#x27;ve followed a regimen of Minoxidil, Nioxin and vitamins (Biotin, Iodine, L-Lysine), but only after switching to Lipogaine a little over three months ago did I notice an actual change. My previously dwindling little vellus hairs at the temples are noticeably longer now, growing in fuller. I also like Lipogaine for the fact that it&#x27;s nearly invisible when it dries, and it dries faster than Minoxidil. I&#x27;m very happy with the results thus far and will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> About 2 years ago I notice my hair thinning slightly in the front corner of my head. I did some research and lipogain was what I decide to try and I haven&#x27;t looked back since. This has stopped the thinning and even the look of thicker hair has appeared. Not sure if it will grow hair back but it will stop the shedding and the hair will grow thicker. In my situation this was is a great product and would recommend it to anyone in the beginning stages of hair loss.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My husband loves it. I&#x27;ve seen much better results with this over other hair treatment products. My husband&#x27;s hair is much thicker and fuller than i thought it would ever be.</li>
    <li> Good product, I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and see improvment, thicker and stronger hair and some new growth</li>
    <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Good communication&lt;br /&gt;Product does not irritate scalp&lt;br /&gt;On my second order.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is thicker</li>
    <li> Just a little history. Been on Finasteride for 2 years that may have slowed down hair loss at best. I have also been on generic Minoxidil for 13 months with little to no results. I figured because of all the great reviews that I would try this. I just finished my first bottle and this is what I found. initially, you lose hair. I lost hair my second week in. Also, it caused some irritation along the hairline where I mainly use it. This has subsided. Now I&#x27;m hoping for some growth which I think I am starting to see, although it being tiny hairs at the moment. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because the price and the irritation and scalp itch. I will come back and review again after my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED: after 2 and a half bottles I am writing and update. First off, a lot of fake reviews about this product. I have lost more hair than usualy with MINOXIDIL products like rogaine. No way people are seeing growth after a few weeks to a month. This product is over priced and not worth it. Leaves a residue and take a while to dry. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about a year now and it does seem to work. I have had some moderate hair gains. My problem with Lipogaine is that the last bottle I received came watered down. It used to be a thick syrup like liquid. Now you can smell alcohol in it and I dont think you are getting the same product as you used to. I will be looking for something else very soon.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine for Men is just so amazing. It definitely worked for me, hands down. Highly recommended to you guys. I&#x27;m still a young 21 y/o guy and began thinning and falling my hair since I was 14 as far as I can remember; tried many products too and didn&#x27;t work. As a standalone use, it may be enough to stop hairfall and thinning, it also promotes new growth. But if you want faster and more stable results, I also recommend to take supplements with it. Am using Hairomega :) Good luck to you guys!!</li>
    <li> I cannot speak to the hair growth potential of this product because I discontinued use of it after about 3 weeks, but after I began to use Lipogaine my head began to itch A LOT. I found myself having to focus on not scratching my head while at work which was both annoying and distracting.</li>
    <li> Purchased this and used for about a month and gave up because I saw no improvement.  6 months later a landing strip was becoming noticeable on the top of my head, meaning that my hair was thinning to the point where you could definitely see the scalp through the foliage front to back.  So I started using this again out of desperation.  This time I definitely noticed a change after a few weeks.  The landing strip became less and less noticeable.  I was even starting to see my hairline in front start to grow back in from the extreme &amp;#34;widow&#x27;s peak&amp;#34;.  I was feeling better about my head and about this product.  Then I ran out.  I made sure I used smaller doses than the recommended amount (just half of a dropper amount rather than a full one and only once a day).  However, it still seemed like it ran out quick.  The price is high and I haven&#x27;t purchased a new bottle yet.  I&#x27;m sold on this product and will probably bite the bullet and buy a few more bottles once I see my hair returning to airport mode.  I&#x27;ll go ahead and recommend the Lipogaine but just make sure you find the right doseage for you like I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for some time with some new very fine hair growing on the thin area. I&#x27;m also noticing fewer hairs in the drain . So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! My hair, very full!!!</li>
    <li> I have using this product about 4 months and I follow all reviews. I try to do not write anything before I give it enough time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started in 7 october 2013 until now. I have hairloss issue from 10 years ago and I can say this stuff help me to do not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;loose more hair because of minoxidil and other ingredient I guess. When It comes to regrowth part I was not satisfied about&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the result. I do not see significant result of hair growth and if it is something there are very tiny hair which doesn&#x27;t grow up. I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also did not miss any dosage and use it regularly , Its not greasy and if you make your hair short easy to use. So all in all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think its ok but I&#x27;m going to switch to another product which has 15 % minoxidil in it.</li>
    <li> hey guys i have been used 1 month and get worst hair loss and unexpected side affects be careful to take this it has some bad side affects for sex life , i have been stopped and start using Garlic and onions natural way regrowth hair accutally it makes positive results try guys garlic an onions side affects free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely at what difference a product can do when you stick to it.  Male Pattern Baldness runs in my family. My dad went bald when he was at the age of 31 and I can start to see it in my brother.  I started losing hair when I was at the age of 22 (there was a slight noticeable difference).  It was embarassing for my own friends to say to me &amp;#34;you&#x27;re starting to bald.&amp;#34; As self conscious as I was, I really needed to do something about it.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products such as Rogaine or generic minoxidil. But nothing worked! All it really did was leave an inflamed scalp that I couldn&#x27;t stop scratching (Leading to further hairloss).  I read some review on this product &amp;#34;Lipogaine,&amp;#34; which at first I was very skeptical about.  I did my research and found that the ingredients in this product promoted healthy hair. You have biotin which is a key essential b vitamin to promote healthy hair to saw palmetto which reduces the amount of dht buildup within the hair follicle. What also sold me was the fact that unlike rogaine, Lipogaine does not use alcohol. Alcohol is a skin irritant which causes redness of the scalp. I couldn&#x27;t stand using Rogaine because it left my head itchy for weeks after I stopped using it. I couldn&#x27;t stop scratching and I would notice at least 30 to 40 strands of hair the next morning. Over the few months of using this product, I actually started to regrow my hair! It wasn&#x27;t like elvis presley thick but I was starting to regrow some of my hair. A few months past and these hairs eventually started getting thicker and thicker! My barber even told me &amp;#34;you&#x27;re lucky you have a full set of hair.&amp;#34; It was comments like this that I was getting that made me want to continue buying Lipogaine.  I recommend any who is worried about baldness to try this product out. Even if you&#x27;re not balding or MPB does not run in your family. Use it as a preventative.  Regrowing hair isn&#x27;t something that happens overnight. It&#x27;s a long process that requires a lot of patience. But I could say after 8 months to a year, I&#x27;ve seen positive results!</li>
    <li> Less irritating to my scalp than Rogaine with same minoxidil content. Not sure if the secondary ingredients are that helpful but probably does not hurt. I plan to continue using this until a more effective proven method becomes available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased my second bottle of Lipogain. A bottle is suppose to last 4 weeks. I use a little less than they recommend and my first bottle lasted 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using Rogain foam on two separate occasions Despite it having the same active ingredient this has resulted in real noticeable growth in just 6-7 weeks. I&#x27;m no walking TV commercial, but I now have good looking healthy hair where I use to have almost none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this in combination with Ds Laboratories Revita Shampoo and Conidition. The new routine is a pain, I&#x27;m normally a 4-5 minute shower kind of guy, but the results have been well worth it. The box says 3-6 months to work, but so far I&#x27;ve seen real improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the simple delivery mechanism just works better. Instead of a fancy foam, it&#x27;s just an eye dropper. I use it with a mirror to spread it out as best I can on the top of my head without getting running droplets, then massage in for a minute or so. I then dry off the excess with a towel (which you turn yellow, but washes out). Routine wise, the best change I&#x27;ve made is to put on my second application right after I get home for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my current pace, I&#x27;m hoping to continue as is for another 6 months then move to only applying Lipogain at night. It does slightly change the texture of your hair and I think it looks more before I apply the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and everything was great until they got rid of the azeliac acid. With the new formula they came up with, i have started losing more hair than usual and my scalp is always itchy now. I do not like this new formula. I will finish what i have, then move on to my old regimen (rogaine + s5 cream ; works great for me but is more time consuming). Hopefully they bring the old formula back.</li>
    <li> The best Minoxidil out there. It dries really quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as oily as most.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite a good product. It thickens, grows, and develops the hair you have. It also seems to help regrow some of the hair you lost. Twice a day is the trick. Also this product does not irritate the scalp as many others do. It has become my regular, everyday hair thinning treatment.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s only shredded my hair . I don&#x27;t know if I should keep using it or stop&lt;br /&gt;. Ugh</li>
    <li> Great product I been using it for almost a year now off and on it has grown thickness in my thin areas. Just be patient and consistent and you will see results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year, the results could not be better, I really feel very satisfied&#x27;ve seen my hair stopped falling, and I&#x27;ve seen more hair, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for 7 months now and I can say that it is the best minoxidil formula on the market. The other products&lt;br /&gt;I used were oily and left my hair greasy and took long to dry. Not Lipogaine. It dries quickly and allows me to style my hair as I normally would. I&#x27;ve noticed that shedding has decreased and my hair looks considerably fuller and healthier. I even think it has helped regrow hair. Realistically, I can&#x27;t expect it to restore my hairline to it&#x27;s original glory but seeing less hair fall out in the shower is reason enough to keep using it. I use it twice a day as recommended and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> your best value is the  3  month supply which I ordered</li>
    <li> About my situation. I was 24 when I began using Lipogaine and have been using the product for about 10 months now. I started off with noticeable thinning of the crown and I was really embarrassed to have pictures taken from behind. There was absolutely no doubt I was thinning. I knew the day would come because every single man in my family is bald.. truly there&#x27;s no hope for me. I did try other things first because this was expensive, off the top of my head I used pills like biotin, 3 in 1 formulations, some other liquid dropper system etc.. Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 3 months of Lipogaine I did start noticing a change and now my hair is substantially thicker. Of course it&#x27;s not the thickest it ever was but I&#x27;m putting a hell of a fight and it&#x27;s far from when I started. I know it will only last so long but I&#x27;d much rather have maybe a few more years of solid coverage than going bald early and to me this product is worth every penny. Try 3 months, see how it works. I don&#x27;t use anything else for thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note... application couldn&#x27;t be easier and it doesn&#x27;t really mess up my longer hair. It looks slightly like I gelled the area but you just play with it and the effect goes away just like a hair gel would. Yes it gets itchy sometimes, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for not losing hair. Wouldn&#x27;t travel without it.</li>
    <li> I noticed that some of my hair was thinning, not a lot but enough that I noticed it.  I decided to be proactive with it and attack it ASAP.  I noticed after about three weeks of continues use my hair was not shedding as much and I was getting thicker coverage.  I don&#x27;t know what it will do for balding hair but for thinning and shedding hair it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this product back in early May after noticing 5 to 15 hairs in the palm of my hands everytime I would shampoo my hair and how it was really thinning out on the front of my scalp. like everyone who reads the reviews on the product I wondered how many were written by a Lipogaine Employee&#x27;s but i still eneded up buying it. I dont recommmend this but before I started applying lipogaine I shaved my head as i felt lipogaine would go right into my scalp and roots stupid mistake on my part as i had never seen myself with a shaved head.i am about 2 months into using lipogaine and i am pleased with the results and i will continue to buy some i will note in bullets points why I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;1. When i first noticed all the hairs falling off while shampooing I was always hesitant to look into my hands but now I have noticed not 1 hair in my palm and my hair is currently 3/4 to a inch long so i am happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;2. i have noticed that my hair is thicker in many parts of my head.&lt;br /&gt;3. I had mini bald spots where there was no hair being grown now i can see hairs coming out while they are thin i feel if i continue to use this my hairs should get thicker.&lt;br /&gt;4. Also I didnt use the whole dosage required I would only use half and i found that work good for me .&lt;br /&gt;5. I should be ordering my next order next week and hopefully i will post my review about 2 months from now meanwhile if you have any question you can post a comment and i will write back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Edgar</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for 7 months and it&#x27;s been pretty good. I&#x27;ve been losing my hair since college and my friends and family have commented that they&#x27;ve noticed a material difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle is supposed to have enough for 30 days, but I find that it lasts a few days longer.</li>
    <li> Great product. Stopped my hair from falling out and has helped it grow in. I&#x27;m 61 years old so I don&#x27;t expect miracles but I&#x27;m very satisfied with product. Been using it to keep what I have since 2013.  Less shedding and my hair is thicker.</li>
    <li> Very bad product. Itching whit continue use, low yields. Not  noticeable changes. I prefer get bake to Vichyr</li>
    <li> Product works well!  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and have seen noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with this product and have been using it for about 2 years. The greatest impact is for balding on the crown of my head. It has reversed the loss and I now have a significantly better density than prior to use.  In the front, it seems to have slowed the loss and I get some new growth so long as I use it twice a day.  I think that one of the best aspects is that it is easy to use, no mess and does not goop up my hair.  I put it in after I get out of the shower when it is easier to get it on the scalp.  It does yellow my pillow if it is still moist when I go to bed.  Additionally, I have had no skin reaction or dry skin.  It is definitely worth a try but you have to stick to it.  I lost confidence at first but I am glad it hung in there for a few months.</li>
    <li> Awesome product with great ingredients that all help to slow hair loss and thicken existing hair. Definitely Like this product over regular minoxidil. After applying religiously for months I have had comments on how my hair looks thicker. I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine, the drug store &amp;#34;equivalents&amp;#34;, and even the decently effective Rogaine foam for years, but with very little noticeable results overall.  Plus, I HATED the fact that if I missed a couple of days because I was on a trip, too busy to get to the store, or the stores were sold out, there was my scalp again, staring at me in the mirror and showing up in every photo I took.  Then I would have to start all over again with the shedding which was even worse--with MORE scalp showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Lipogaine, I noticed a significant reduction in the amount of visible scalp before I was even halfway through my first bottle.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since, and it has been over a year since those days of Rogaine Foam.  It just works better in my opinion.  I haven&#x27;t had that shiny scalp peering through my pictures, and people have stopped noticing my hair loss and offering advice. (Yes, that really used to happen--all the time)  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could easily go to CVS and pick up another product, and it&#x27;s interesting how no one has even heard of this product, but I am convinced this is the best topical product to control hair loss.  By the way, my current powerhouse combination is Lipogaine plus the Bosley Hair System (switched over from Nioxin), and it works.  I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use and effective. I have purchased this product for over a year now. Thanks</li>
    <li> after using this products 3.5 months i did see very little result, i think its expensive compare to other product. I will still use minoxidil except i am going to go back using the Kirkland brand which you could get 6 boxes for price of one. I&#x27;m not so much for the amount of it, that is more the result wasn&#x27;t as good as i expected, i guess.. i would like to see this item with 6 month supply for about $50 ish so i can buy it back.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy, just another product similar to the other popular brands out there. No changes for me</li>
    <li> Best topical cocktail available on the market to regrow hair. Much better than straight Rogaine. You will feel and notice the difference. Accept no substitutes! The mild acid dramatically improves penetration of the scalp, ingredients like saw palmetto enhance dht blockage (note: saw palmetto has only been scientifically proven as a blocker when used topically on the skin). If you have only tried Minoxidil 5% or lower, try this. It costs more, but its worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two years now, along the male pattern baldness areas next to my temples. I have the convenient comparison of an identical twin (who has not used any hair regrowth products) with whom to compare hairlines. By all accounts the returns have been very good! Compared to him, and from what I remember from before starting to use Lipogaine, there has been a decent amount of re-growth and definitely maintenance of the hair that was already there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used other hair loss products and so cannot speak to the effectiveness of Lipogaine versus what else is out there (e.g., Rogaine), but it seems to be working well for me and I&#x27;d say give it a shot!</li>
    <li> At first, I was only using Lipogaine once a day, which stopped the thinning; however, when I began using it twice a day, I benefitted from new hair growth. Before using Lipogaine, I noticed excess hair loss while shampooing (in my hands), which has completely stopped while using this product. Furthermore, unlike Rogaine and Kirkland Minoxidil, Lipogaine does not have that foul odor that emanates from your scalp throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine is effective at slowing the rate of hair loss and even promotes some noticeable hair growth.  It should be used daily (twice daily, even) for maximum results.  I wish they made this formula even stronger, but it does the job with just 5% minoxidil.  I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> I am just wrapping up my seventh month on Lipogaine. When I started in early February, I had a sizable, growing bald spot on the crown. Since then, fuzz has grown in, and I am just recently seeing full, long hairs growing in that spot. Very happy to say that my experience has been slow, but progressive regrowth. Sticking with it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he loves it!  Says it&#x27;s better than Rogaine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine now regularly for over a year and I think I can finally write a thorough review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 27 year old half-white, half-asian male, I began seeing distinct hair loss on the top of the head at 21 years old. I&#x27;m the first one in my family to have this problem, and it was localized to just the crown (it thins uniformly over a 5-inch diameter patch at the top of my scalp). I used a combination of different approaches, Eastern, Western, Holistic, everything to try to slow the process for the first 4 years, including Rogaine and Rogaine foam, and when I was 25 I switched to just using Lipogaine. I apply it twice a day, morning and night, and have not missed any days since I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first 3 months I did not notice any increase in hair, which is normal.&lt;br /&gt;During the first 4-5 months I noticed the largest increase in hair from using the product (about 20% improvement).&lt;br /&gt;During the first 6-8 months hair continued to increase but slowed down (about 10% improvement).&lt;br /&gt;After the first 8 months, I have not noticed any continued improvement, and have actually seen some of the hair recede from the &amp;#34;peak benefit&amp;#34; time, albeit not at the same high rate as before I started using Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that if you are doing anything in your life that requires you to get very little sleep, or gives you a large amount of stress, like a very demanding job or school, you will probably not see results from any hair restoration project. I&#x27;ve seen my hair fluctuate even while using this product due to lack of sleep. Also, make sure you switch to a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t contain SLS. I&#x27;ve seen most of the new hair from this go away in just a week from going back to a shampoo with SLS, only to come back very slowly once I&#x27;d switched back to a natural shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is quite easy to apply - I&#x27;d recommend using the dropper to squeeze little bits at a time out all overdifferent affected areas of the scalp and rubbing it in right afterward. It stings if it drips down into your eyes, so make sure you apply while looking in a mirror so you can see if a stray drop is heading in that direction. It does make the hair rather sticky/greasy, and seems to attract certain flying insects while outdoors. This, to me, is still all favorable to having the hair lost entirely. It also seems slightly less greasy than Rogaine or Rogaine foam, and washes out with just water. If you are using Caboki or Toppik at the same time as this, it will likely cause the concealer to clump up and not look very convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have not been &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; by any stretch of the imagination. I still have very thin hair at the top of my head. What Lipogaine has done has been to slow down the process of thinning, so that it is about where it was at when I was 24. In percentage terms, the hair appears to be about 30% fuller than when I started, but has now started to recede again slowly. I am still giving the product 5 stars though, since it is literally the only thing I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s had any impact on my hair.</li>
    <li> I started using Lipogaine a little over a year ago to put a stop to my receding hairline and noticed positive results a little over 2 months in. Not only did my hair stop falling out, I actually noticed some regrowth. I saw the positive results very soon and a couple other people noticed as well. I most definitely recommend this product with a combination of finasteride and anti balding shampoos. I think the extra ingredients in Lipogaine is what sets it apart from the generic minoxidil brands and even Rogaine. This product is most definitely worth the money. Five stars!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product, I&#x27;ve used for 2 months, it does made a big difference for my hair. it&#x27;s thicker and thicker, just ordered another bottle</li>
    <li> Best on market.the only one works for me</li>
    <li> Lipogaine has helped me keep my hair, and has also regrow a good amount of hair back.</li>
    <li> Great product, does what it says, what more can you ask?</li>
    <li> First hair loss product that i used in years that actually works.. I&#x27;ve been on Lipogaine for a year now and i&#x27;m amazed with the result. Its truly exceeded my expectation. I&#x27;ve been battling hair loss for 10 year so far; i spent thousands of dollars on all kind of products and this is the best so far. I&#x27;ve been recommending the product  to all friends and family that suffer from hair loss.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend use it every other day and it leaves the hair kind of greasy but it works for him.</li>
    <li> I do think it has slowed my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two months after I read about it on the Internet. However,  it does not work for me. It was just waste of  money.</li>
    <li> It look a while (about 3 months) to see the hair regrowth, but it definitely worked for me. I used a lot of hair loss products before this. So I knew what I expected. Otherwise, I probably would have given up. I am glad that I didn&#x27;t. There is no doubt this is the best products I have tried. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment-Once a day, (the bottle recommends twice a day) Paying special attention to problem areas. Used in conjunction with Nizoral anti dandruff shampoo. (look it up, you NEED a healthy scalp for any hairloss regiment to work)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was experiencing a receding hairline, loss of corners, and overall a general thinning of hair. I also was experiencing scalp pain and irritation typical of male pattern baldness. I&#x27;m 22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First couple weeks I experienced increased shedding and a significant dandruff increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following this, the scalp irritation and aching that I was suffering to PRIOR to beginning treatment was relieved. Essentially, the DHT blockers in lipogaine have brought my scalp to the chemical balance that it should be. My hair dresser actually commented a couple weeks ago that my scalp looked much healthier than it normally does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of recently, I&#x27;ve noticed tiny little hair coming up. It looks like my hair is on its way back..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to someone who is like me, experiencing the first stages of male pattern baldness, and wants to be proactive about it, but doesn&#x27;t want to commit the time to an extensive regimen and blow hundreds of dollars. This is a great product for men who want an ounce of prevention.</li>
    <li> Works total wonders for those concerned with thinning hair lines. I am 24 and have very thick blond hair (I&#x27;m Polish). The left side of my hairline was thinning mildly though and I have been using this for 3 months and it does work, takes patience though so give it time before you expect results. I am a heavy gym goer and DHT is more common among body builders. This really helps to combat that though...I would also recommend using with a derma roller (micro needle, 1mm) because it helps your scalp absorb Lipogaine even better. Do your research if you are considering it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> 4 weeks in and noticing minor growth. Maybe its just in my head that its working. gonna keep going though .Only 4 stars cause its leave my scalp flaky.</li>
    <li> thanks to lipogaine i&#x27;m no longer worried about hairloss.  now i&#x27;m worried about heart problems! &amp; after only a wk of use.  toxic stuff... clearly i have a sensitivity to minoxidil but dont kid yourself that a topical application won&#x27;t get into your system</li>
    <li> OK, this is a real review on Amazon, not an employee of the company writing fake reviews (very popular on Amazon), please be sure to click on \\&quot;all reviews of mine\\&quot; to see that I purchase a lot of products on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, been using rogane foam for about 4 years with little results. I love the foam as it goes in easy and styles hair almost as hair gel. After getting frustrated with hair loss, I decided to spend the $6,000 and get a hair transplant from the Hair Club. They did a good job, but trust me, I wish I had an additional $6k to get my hair looking really good. Though the hair transplant made my hair look a little better, you will continue to lose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost 2 years from my hair transplant and using rogane foam for 4 years, I needed to try something different. I came across this product on amazon and read the reviews. People said it worked well so I decided to give it a try. Been using for about 3 months now (once a day) and notice about a 20% difference in thickness. What really keeps me coming back, my wife and family just recently started to tell me my hair looks thicker and asked if I have done anything different. I can tell you it&#x27;s not the hair transplant I received (that stopped growing in a year ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pretty amazing! Try this along with Nioxin Stage 2: shampoo, conditioner, and scalp treatment for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is a little high compared to other hair growth products.</li>
    <li> The only product that made my hair grow but not a lot. I decided to go bald after my wife confessed that she like Damon Wayans when she was young. She said I love sexy bald. So now I&#x27;m bald with a goatee.</li>
    <li> After 3 months my hair is looking more full, I use it along with the the big 3 shampoo. I like the results.   Update: I just ordered lipogaine, and its seems different now, smells more like alcohol and looks more clear, then yellow. Has anybody experienced this.</li>
    <li> My husband tried this in his hair regime for almost a year.  He&#x27;s done extensive research on hair regrowth and keeping what you&#x27;ve got and chose this product over the TONS of them out there.  (If you&#x27;re looking for hair growth/regrowth products for men, you&#x27;ll find there are probably more of them out there claiming to do miracles than women&#x27;s products!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With using Lipogaine, I noticed his hair to be thicker.  I also noticed the Lipogaine didn&#x27;t smell terrible like some of the treatments he tried before it.  He noticed it was a little oily at first, but after using it a few times, he adjusted the dosage to a place where that wasn&#x27;t an issue.  He used the Lipogaine in conjunction with the Big 3 Shampoo they make to maximize effect.  I know that some say if you stop using it, any effects immediately disappear, but in his case this hasn&#x27;t been the case.  He stopped using it at least six months ago and his hair has stayed fuller and looks great even though he&#x27;s not using it, so either it stays in the system or the results are real and they last.  (I&#x27;d like to go with the latter!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;d totally recommend Lipogaine if you&#x27;re looking for a real product that does what it claims.  If you have questions about Lipogaine, feel free to contact us.&lt;br /&gt;Have a great week!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference</li>
    <li> I found that it works great and would recommend it to anyone.It was sent as in a respectful way i;m very happy.................</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a year now. I can certainly say that after 3 months, I had experienced regrowth, particularly on the top of my head. I can compare pictures that were taken last year from before I started with what I see now, and there is a glare off the top of my scalp from fluorescent lights in the photos that is not there now. For the first few months I saw a handful of hairs to the side of my front receding hairline sprout and come in, but nothing further than that happened other than the thickening and filling of the hair in the area I do have head, both in the front and particularly on the top. I got a haircut a month ago and my stylist was certain I had had a transplant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and It&#x27;s been working pretty well on my hair. before this I was continuously losing hair and it was getting faster and faster. the top and front of my hair was going very very thin and empty. everybody who saw me said you&#x27;re getting bald. so I decided to search for a product and I found Lipogaine the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it with biotin and also the Lipogaine shampoo. It started working on my hair pretty quickly. at first it increases your hair loss a little bit. then thin hair grows and gradually they get more and thicker. in the first weeks I usually dropped a little of the liquid on my forehead by accident and even my forehead started to grow dark thin hair. after about two month the top and front of my head was almost 70% full and after 4 month it was almost 90% full of hair. many people have appreciated my treatment and asked my what I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps: the shampoo you use with it is very important. I recommend the Lipogaine shampoo. when I was using another shampoo my hair loss was getting even faster. also you may need constant use of Lipogaine to keep your hair.</li>
    <li> i just wanted to post a review for all of you guys out there that are looking for a hair loss product that actually works, this is it!!!. I have been using lipogaine for almost a 2 years, and thanks to this product i was able to maintain, and improve greatly the quality of my hair, i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used \\&quot;Lipogaine for men\\&quot; on and off in the past, with stints Iasting anywhere between 4 to 6 months. However, as of the time of writing of this review, I have been using this product regularly for the past 3 months. So far, from what I have experienced, it has helped me maintain existing hair and thickened them up a bit (no visible regrowth though). Hair-loss falls in the category of progressive diseases, the kind that get worse as time passes by. It takes a while to notice loss of hair, once hair-loss has started, and significantly longer to see any improvements on beginning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my personal experience of hair-loss products, tried and tested minoxidil containing products work good when combined with something that can halt the progression of hair-loss (such as propecia) and supplements that provide the necessary nutrients for hair growth. Now, \\&quot;Lipogaine for men\\&quot; is on the expensive side as far as minoxidil formulations are concerned, but it does boast of liposomal delivery vehicles which in theory are supposed to enhance the trans-dermal uptake of minoxidil on the scalp. Additionally it also contains biotin - a well known promoter of healthy hair growth, saw palmetto extract - a proven albeit weak blocker of  di-hydro testosterone (DHT) synthesis and other components. I have personally tried several treatments in the past, and I found that this product is a good over-the-counter option at maintaining existing hair. In the past three months of usage, I have also seen noticeable thickening of my existing hair (I have been using propecia and hair nutrient supplements  from Solaray as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is common with minoxidil formulations, upon initiation of treatment one usually experiences accelerated hair-shedding. My personal experience with this product was no different; for the first two months of using \\&quot;Lipogaine for men\\&quot; I witnessed an increase in hair-shedding to the point where my scalp hair began to look wispier than usual (and I had to resort to extra dabs of Caboki and Dermmatch). But after the two months, hair shedding reduced to normal and in the past few weeks my hair has come back thicker than before (my fiance was the one who noticed it first). This product does not have any fragrance, but it takes a while to dry off and sometimes leaves the hair a bit coarse after drying off. I personally think that&#x27;s a pro as it makes my hair feel stronger (I usually wear my hair short, people with longer hair might find this to be a problem, but putting it on while the scalp is still damp seems to solve it).  So, all in all, I am happy with this product and will definitely recommend it to anyone suffering from hair-loss, this is the next best thing to 10% Minoxidil (which requires a prescription and has the added dis-advantage of not being very heart healthy).</li>
    <li> I noticed that my facial hairs got significantly tell people to just stop. I am sad that my front hair didn&#x27;t see as great of achievement as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> A new take on snake oil, used for 6 months and zero results. if you are loosing your hair, ask your doctor about Finasteride. It&#x27;s the only way to get your frontal hair loss back (for most) period. I spent hundreds on stuff like this for years and nothing worked. And then a friend told me about Finasteride, a real medication tested in real labs with a real FDA approval with real results. And by the way, Finasteride is a generic form of Propecia. If you have insurance it will cost you about $5 a month, instead of $25 for lipogaine, $45 for viciscal, and $30 for rogaine. Finasteride is also used as a prostate deflamation treatment, but for hair loss you cut the pill into quarters or 1/4 the size. A bottle of 30 pills for $5 lasts 3 months and I have most of&lt;br /&gt;My hair back after 4 months. Seriously, this lipogaine stuff didnt work for me. and throwing money away with wishful thinking won&#x27;t fix any problems.</li>
    <li> This is a very great product, better than anything out there by far.</li>
    <li> This does not work for me. I have not seen any regrowth of my hair. I will not be spending money on this product again.</li>
    <li> I really noticed a difference the first 3-4 months of using this product. Please note, most men will experience a shedding phase before noticing regrowth.  I have been using it now for over 18 months and I have not seen any new growth BUT I also have not lost any more hair.  Over all great product and awesome customer service!</li>
    <li> I definitely prefer this over the regular Kirkland or Rogain Minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;It dries fast and isn&#x27;t so runny that it just slides down my head , it feels like it&#x27;s being absorbed. I am seeing results of hair growth. The other Kirkland brand seemed to have stopped working after 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel crunchy or sticky like the other Minoxidil products. I used to think my choices were to either have a bad hair day or no hair at all (when I used the other products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is with the price, it&#x27;s considerably more expensive and the only real difference I see is their proprietary blend of easily purchased products, like saw palmetto. I&#x27;m curious if I would see the same results by mixing the less expensive minoxidil and liquid saw palmetto together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years I think.  I use it in conjunction with a laser regrow device, pills,  and fillers and I still look like I have a full head of hair at 38 years old.  (My hair was super thin on top starting at 27 years old).  I&#x27;ll stick with it.  There is no miracle product.  I believe success entails consistency and multiple approaches, but I like lipogaine shampoo and this serum.</li>
    <li> It claims to have all the hair loss fighting agents all in one bottle. I use the generic, because this stuff is so damn expensive, but this stuff is definitely nicer. It&#x27;s not runny or anything.</li>
    <li> I did not find any use after using for a month and caused losing little more hair,  review will be much better after regain.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about possible irritation, based on some reviews, but I think that person must have had an allergy to one of the ingredients.  I&#x27;m using 0.5 mL because my bald spot is relatively small- a bottle should last 2 months!  So far (3-4 weeks), seem to be working as advertised, with absolutely NO irritation and minimal stickiness, as mentioned in other reviews- actually makes my remaining/surrounding, normally very straight thin hair thicker when it dries (which is relatively quick). Washes out easily and completely.  If anything, I&#x27;m likely to forget to use it if I don&#x27;t set a reminder.  I would give it five stars, but it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s going to work...</li>
    <li> it works. Although it is like a weird crystyllized liquid on your forehead so I only do it at night. Otherwise it is shiny. Grows hair!</li>
    <li> BOught this for my husband who has a receding hairline.  He hasn&#x27;t been able to use Rogaine because it said it&#x27;s not for receding hairlines, and he was super stressed about his hair because he is still in his 30s!  I bought this for him after a friend told me to just try it so I did, and my husband used it every day as directed.  After 2 weeks of use we could already see very small light hairs starting to grow.  It&#x27;s been 6 weeks since he started using this and he&#x27;s on his second bottle and there is definite, noticeable hair growth!  We were skeptical at first but completely sold now :)</li>
    <li> I really hoped this would be the solution to my hair loss, but after giving it several days of use and a horrible burning scalp reaction, I will not be using this any longer.  I really wished I would be OK using this as it appears it worked for many on here.  Going to try an alternate minoxidil solution.</li>
    <li> 1st) Wow, I got random chest pains after about a week of using this product so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s efficiency. and yes it&#x27;s does seem like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd) Okay it does feel like super glue for a bit until it dries. But the chest pains I was getting is because like a fool I was putting too much on at once. But I am beginning to see some new hairs coming in on the front and on top. Peach fuzz at first now they are getting longer. I use this product at night and Minoxidil during the day. Fingers crossed I have been thinning for 20 plus years so this is kinda exciting.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 -7 months now and have noticed a slight improvement in the rate at which hair is falling out. Although thin hairs are beginning to grow in, they are rather light in color and do not seem to be darkening with time. I hope to see stronger regrowth in the coming year.</li>
    <li> The product overall seems to be good....I will publish an update after a couple of months. The only issue is that is very oily and if you are prone to pimples you must wash your forehead after applying it because it will cause a break out.</li>
    <li> After trying Regaine for a couple of months, without strong results, I decided to try Lipogaine. This product really works, by the third week I wasn&#x27;t shedding any more. Just watch out for your pillows as it may stain them if you don&#x27;t let it dry enough.</li>
    <li> Does what it should do, and what it states to do.</li>
    <li> Been using Lipogaine for 4 months and shedding has stopped. Not much regrowth yet, but I know it&#x27;s still early in the game.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic: it&#x27;s easy to use (two applications a day... I space them 12 hours apart); and provides results. I started seeing results after the first month, especially near my temples. I&#x27;m approaching the 5 month mark and am still seeing improvement. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my hair looks like after a year! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the next best thing to the 15% version that was recently banned in the US. I used it when Rogaine stopped working for me. Great product that works!</li>
    <li> I think this is an amazing product!! I have been using it for over 4 months. In March 2012 I went to see a hair transplant specialist in my area: I am now 37, and have been loosing hair on the top of my head for about 16-20 months prior to that. It was receding fast, and I was quite upset, as I have always had a full head of hair. The transplant surgeon said that with a hair transplant I will have an almost full head of hair again, but..the cost will be $9 000. He also said that it is hereditary, and by same time next year (i.e. March 2013) I will loose most of my hair on the top of my head, if I do not elect to do the surgery. I decided to start saving money for the surgery, but also thought I would try to get some of my hair to regrow using different over the counter meds and potions. Lipogaine was the only product I bought .I did quite a bit of research prior to ordering it. 4 months later, my hair is growing in all of the areas where it was shedding, and I no longer see any bold patches anywhere on my scalp!! Love you, Lipogaine!!-)</li>
    <li> So after 7 weeks I&#x27;ll report that the product has helped stimulate some of the small hairs on my head, though those are still quite thin, but at least they&#x27;re growing. As for parts of my scalp that are completely bald (just a small area on top), it really hasn&#x27;t done much. Overall I&#x27;m pretty impressed and will continue. Even some growth is better than none. I&#x27;ll continue to monitor. I use .5ml in the morning and .5ml in the evening.</li>
    <li> I am a 62 year old man who is mostly bald on top and on the crown of my head.  My hope for this product was to make my existing hair thicker and to fill in the crown a little and raise the hairline on the sides of my head a little bit too.  This product accomplished all of this in the first couple months of use. It added about 1\\&quot; to my crown and about 3/4\\&quot; to the sides.  Since then I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional growth, but I am pleased with what it has done.</li>
    <li> This product has truly been great. About 6 months ago I noticed that I had noticeable hair falling out and I did a lot of research to find the best product out there. After using lipogaine for several months now, I have stopped the hair loss and grown back hair in areas that were losing hair. I apply the product in the morning and at night, and it does not irritate my scalp or cause any redness. The product is good for sensitive skin, and has helped me with my own hair loss without negative side effects. I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing thinning hair and looking for a remedy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for several months now, after losing the option of more potent products as a result of a recent FDA crackdown on hair growth product companies.  My search for the most potent hair growth products now available led me to Lipogaine, which contains 5% minoxidil, azelaic acid, which helps reduce DHT in the scalp, and retinol, which aids in the absorption of minoxidil.  The other ingredients in Lipogaine are nice to have too, like the saw palmetto extract and beta-sitosterol, though what they might be able to do when applied topically is unclear to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution takes a bit of time to dry, but other products have taken much longer for me, especially when there are more active ingredients than just minoxidil.  I find that what works best for me is to apply the full 1 ml amount at bedtime, and do half of that in the morning before heading out, which then doesn&#x27;t give me much of an issue with drying.  It&#x27;s also a bit sticky when dry, but a half application in the morning is easy to work with when dry and even before it&#x27;s dry.  And since I&#x27;ve used so much minoxidil solution by this point of my life, it&#x27;s better for me to give my scalp a bit of a break during the day at this point.  The eyedropper applicator features 4 measurement lines to help me do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does seem to be maintaining the state of my hair growth reasonably well.  Again, I&#x27;m at a more advanced stage and condition of hair loss than many others may be, so nothing that I know of out there yet can get it all to grow back, but I&#x27;m happy with the results from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing I&#x27;ll add in response to the reviewer that suggested blow drying after applying - you do not want to do that.  It&#x27;s important for minoxidil to stay in liquid form on the scalp for a while so that it can be absorbed.  Once it&#x27;s dry, it will be absorbed far less, or not at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using minoxidil for a number of years now. I have tried most brands, including branded and generic versions. I was a HUGE fan of Ligogaine 15, and was extremely disappointed with it was taken off the shelves. I did not expect much from this version, however, it has continued to maintain and thicken my hair. I do not really suffer much from the crown (no noticeable thinning), but I did start to recede at the front. I was pleased with lipogaine&#x27;s ability to slow this regression, and I have also started to notice some regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that at least 6 months is needed to see drastic gains. You will notice less hair shedding pretty soon however. I do urge that you continue the regimen without disruption to get the most out of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient profile is excellent, and I have google&#x27;d the hell out of each and every one so should you, and you will understand the importance of each. As far as the Minoxidil/azelaic acid combination, the application of this product is awesome. It is not sticky, and it dries very fast. You can easily use it with longer hair, or short hair. There is a little residue, but nothing that wouldn&#x27;t pass as a bit of hair gel. There is no smell also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a sensitive scalp, and this stuff is not that harsh. I use nizoral also, and stick to a simple shampoo typically with salycic acid to clear out the folicules and prep the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product, and will NOT order any other type of product. The company is really reliable, the price is very very good and the shipping is always on time!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a year.  After trying numerous products that simply did not work as promised, I was thrilled to find a product that was affordable AND works.  I am telling you, you WILL have noticeable results using this product.  I have not had any side effects, so thankfully, using this product has given me nothing but positive results!!!!  Give it a shot for three months and see for yourself..</li>
    <li> I had mostly used Rogaine foam for a number of years and did see some growth on the back of my head. Then I stopped for a while and saw significant pattern baldness from front to back. Decided to try something again and got interested in Lipogaine because of the good reviews. I have used it for around 6 weeks every night, and have noticed significant regrowth in all the thinning areas. I will continue to use it and would highly recommend it. It does leave a residual stickiness in the hair, much like a hairspray, but it keeps my hair in place and seems to add body, so I&#x27;m fine with it. All in all, a great experience with the product so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past several months now, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference between using just a Minoxidal solution like Rogaine, and using a product like this one (minoxidil and azelaic acid). The Azelaic Acid this product provides acts as an effective DHT blocker and compliments the minoxidil as a growth stimulant. When I used just the Minoxidil alone, it wasn&#x27;t quite as effective and I noticed my hair continued to thin and fall out. After several months of use with this product, I noticed less hair falling out (however my hair hasn&#x27;t got quite as thick yet as I would like it to). The only thing I dont like about this product(and any liquid product for that matter) is that it tends to sometimes drip after the application. The foam product that rogaine offers is an easier application to apply, which it why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. But as far as effectiveness, this is one of the better products out there.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than a year now. During the first month or two, I didn&#x27;t notice anything in particular. From 3-6 months, I noticed some hair regrowing in the front- which was GREAT! I was super excited. From then on, I noticed I wasn&#x27;t growing anything new, but it helped (and still is helping) with less hair falling out than if I didn&#x27;t use the product. I&#x27;m still using this on a daily basis because I haven&#x27;t found anything better thus far- especially in my price range. Bottom line, recommended!!!</li>
    <li> bought this for a friend and it worked very well on the parts where there was already hair, but not much or rare. However, on the bald parts it doesn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
    <li> This will work after a while&lt;br /&gt; Dont freak out at the beginning because u will shed some hair for like 4 days or a week but then you will start to see and feel little hairs coming out this stuff is better then rogaine. Trust me</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for approximately 3 1/2 months and this is a quality minoxidil. You will not get the itchy flakey scalp that you get with a generic product. As far as hair growth, I only use it once a day in the evening before bed, so I&#x27;m not seeing much hair growth at this time. But one thing for sure, it stopped any further hair loss. I no longer see the hairs in the shower daily like I used to. I&#x27;m ready to try The big 3 shampoo to improve the results.</li>
    <li> Made my scalp peel and caused flaky dandruff. I experienced an extremely bad hair shed like nothing before...hair just kept falling out day after day week after week. Also had abrupt, abnormal and noticeable weight gain. I know that it&#x27;s one of the side effects of minoxidil but I guess the hyper-absorbtion of this product caused this. (scary stuff)</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I cannot stress the fact enough. It has regrown hair I lost long ago.    I used a drugstore brand of minoxidil for years with moderate success. Didn&#x27;t really regrow hair, just seemed to maintain what I had left. After a lengthy hospital stay and having to temporarily stop my regular regimen, I was seeing alarming amounts of hair falling out and was desperately seeking something to reverse the trend. The drugstore minoxidil didn&#x27;t seem to help much and I was even contemplating more drastic measures. After finding Lipogaine on Amazon, I thought I&#x27;d step up to the pump and try it. I really didn&#x27;t have much left to lose.    Nearly 60 days into using it once a day prior to bedtime, the hair loss has stopped and I am regrowing hair on both my crown and temples. My hair is overall thicker and healthier. My wife said it is noticeably fuller and can&#x27;t stop running her fingers through it. Neither can I!    I am now using the Lipogaine shampoo, alternating it with Regenpure or Nioxin shampoo and conditioner. The results are phenomenal.    While it may not work for everyone and some users may be impatient, it has exceeded my expectations. I am completely satisfied with Lipogaine and highly recommend it to anyone concerned about hair loss.    Don&#x27;t hesitate. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> I love the was my hair feels after i use this. Thick . isnt that the goal. after using it alot i do Notice barly ANY hair falling off. and fuzzy hair coming out too.  so i say it works. i will keep it at it for many months. let see what happens then.</li>
    <li> I am a 38 year old male who has experienced a gradual thinning on top and a receding hairline in the front since my late 20s.  The back had thinned so much that others referred to it as my bald spot and there was also quite a noticeable difference in the density of the top versus the sides.    Last year I decided to try this product after researching the internet.  Within the first week of using it (twice a day as the instructions recommend) I noticed less hair loss in the shower and on my pillow in the mornings.  In the second and third week I noticed very thin and tiny hair follicles beginning to spring up in the front where my hair had completely disappeared (I applied it in the front and the back).    I didn&#x27;t notice as much of a change after that until around the 3rd or 4th month of continued use.  That&#x27;s when I could tell that my hair overall was more dense on top and my bald spot had become less visible. After one year of using Lipogaine my hairline is still not where it was in my youth but it is definitely closer to my boyhood hairline than before I started.  More importantly my bald spot is barley noticeable now and my hair is much thicker overall on top.  I&#x27;ve even had others notice and comment.</li>
    <li> Honestly did not work for me at all</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used it for a more than 12 months as it stands and my true review would be that that the beginning 1-2 months were full of initial shedding, followed my miraculous hair growth, as can be seen in the customer pictures posted by few folks. I saw that eventually the health of the new grown hair did go down a bit and I&#x27;d say that since then its effect are more towards maintenance than constant re-growth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely say that you have to look at it in a way of a long term treatment and not completely go of it.&lt;br /&gt;It deserves a 4 str - though I do feel that the effect was so much magical in the first 6 months. (Though I cannot deny that I did become lazy about applying it - and now am trying to become very regular again :))</li>
    <li> Bought for one of my friends, who told me that he has his hair back after contiunuously used for 2 months. &amp;#34;No stink!&amp;#34; He said, &amp;#34;Applied 2 times a day and that is it.&amp;#34; Though hair grown by Minoxidil will gradually lose if you stop using, it does somehow keep your hair follicle alive...</li>
    <li> I find these reviews to be very suspicious. Not one mispelled word and the grammar is perfect in over 100 reviews.</li>
    <li> So after doing a fair amount of research including videos, blog entries, and personal experiences Lipogaine for men seems to be the absolute best game in town right now when it comes to a topical solution for hair loss or thinning. It&#x27;s really a great combination because of the Azelaic acid with the 5% Minoxidil, it has a quick dry formula so you don&#x27;t have to wait forever after application. I have seen no problems with redness or irritated scalp like happens with some lesser valued Minoxidil formulas. I&#x27;ve used it for about 5 weeks now and it has certainly done what it claims. There is so much less hair in the drain at the end of the shower and that is a great sign that this stuff is doing it&#x27;s job to combat DHT buildup which is usually the main cause of why we start to lose hair. I can also say that the receding of my hairline has stopped and thickening is starting where those sides areas where once thinning out. If you are going to try using a topical solution for hair loss than this is absolutely worth the 25 dollars for a bottle, and with a money back guarantee how can you go wrong? Give Lipogaine a try and you won&#x27;t be sorry you did!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this for a couple of years now. I’d done some research back when my hair loss began and this is the product that many folks on hair loss forums were using it seemed. I liked the ancillary ingredients in it in addition to Minoxidil so decided to give it a try. I think Azelaic acid got removed since then which I now purchase separately. My hair loss has stalled completely, although I can’t say I’ve seen re-growth of any new hairs.</li>
    <li> +++UPDATE - 12/30/2013++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced these reviews are being done by employees of this company or they are paid reviews.  This product is so greasy and oily that it would be impossible for someone not to have it run down the side of their head after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******UPDATE********&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to stop using this product due to the greasiness of it. It is very difficult to apply and also makes your hair feel like you are using Gel (once it dries). I am not completely bald, but do have thinning hair on my crown.  I do think this product works, I just cannot stand the application time and the staining (pillow, shirts, etc) that this product leaves behind (this product is yellow-ish). This, added to the costs, encouraged me to change to the Kirkland liquid Minoxidil as well as the Foam (extremely easy to apply) version of Minoxidil.  I typically use the foam before work, then try and use the liquid at night a few hours before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a shot to try out...if you don&#x27;t mind the application time, this may still be a product for you.  I just prefer the ease and performance of the foam (quick to apply) or clear liquid Minoxidil (no stain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this for 1 1/2 bottles now for thinning at the crown of my head. I would say after the first bottle I thought things were getting worse, so make sure you plan to use at least 3 bottles of this stuff before getting frustrated.  I have noticed that when using the first bottle, I actually saw an increase of hair falling out.  Not sure if that was normal, or I was just paying more attention. Either way, things are better now.  Also, make sure you are willing to make this part of your daily routine since you have to apply it 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 1/2 way through the 2nd bottle, I am beginning to see less thinning, so I really think this product is worth the shot. I also cut out all aspartame from my diet (no more diet cokes, etc) so there is another variable there.  I would say this product is worth trying for 2-3 bottles if you are noticing thinning at the crown of your head. Once it dries, it make your hair feel like you are using gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use 3 or 4 bottles to &#x27;jump start&#x27; my hair re-growth, then switch to the other, less expensive foam brands (Kirkland Foam or other Foam).  I also plan to only use this product at night (assuming my hair continues to re-grow at the rate it is at now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work well, I apply twice a day (before work, then at night several hours before bed), but have missed a few days once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;Does not smell too bad&lt;br /&gt;shipping is usually fast (arrives within 2-3 days)&lt;br /&gt;bottle is small for travel for TSA regulations :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat expensive compared to others&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to dry (1-2 hours, not sure why the other review say it dries fast)&lt;br /&gt;Runs when applied (get ready to use your hands to help rub it in)&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are not that clear, meaning they dont inform you to use your hands or dont apply when you think you are going to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Get a blow dryer to help it dry faster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;I am suspicious of all the reviews on this product. It almost seems as if employees of this company are writing some of these 5 start reviews. One of my thoughts for this was the fact that some of these reviewers have 0 other reviews on Amazon products and claim that the products works wonders. Dont get me wrong, I think its a decent product, I&#x27;m just not a little hesitant to believe a reviewer who claims 5 stars, has no other reviews, provides no timeline for how long they have used the products, and is saying \\&quot;best product ever\\&quot;, \\&quot;dries fast\\&quot;, etc...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about about a week now, but I&#x27;ll go ahead and give a little preliminary review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too did a pretty good bit of online research about where to turn for my hair problems - I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine steadily for a couple of years now and really am not sure if I&#x27;ve ever seen any results from it. When I started using it, I was really only dealing with a receding hairline, but at this point I&#x27;ve got more all-over thinning. I think I may have brought that on myself by using a competing product - I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon will let me name it, but it rhymes with Schmectral EMT - contrary to the instructions. It was way too sticky/greasy to use in the morning, so I only applied it at night, and I ended up quitting after about two months because it seemed to be doing more damage than good. So I probably quit mid-shed, and my hair really hasn&#x27;t recovered from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to Lipogaine: supposedly not sticky/greasy, more effective than Rogaine, has some of the same long-term hair retention as Propecia (which I used for a year but quit because of side effects), etc. A wonder drug, if the reviews are to be believed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having only used it for a week, I can&#x27;t speak to how awesome it as at regrowth or retention, but I DO seem to be losing less hair in the sink and the shower. I CAN say that this stuff is NOT as invisible and quick-dry as some reviewers are saying...nothing compares to Rogaine foam for that, including this. It goes on pretty greasy and takes about an hour or an hour and a half to dry in my hair. When it DOES dry, it&#x27;s fantastic. Adds some thickness and heft to my hair, lets me style it, not greasy whatsoever. But it IS greasy during the drying phase and can leave a powdery whitish residue when it has dried (pretty easy to get rid of, though - you can brush it out or whatever). If you can tough out the greasy drying phase, you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable shed yet, but it couldbe that all of my Rogaine use means I might skip that phase. Seems like Lipogaine might be giving me some dark circles under the eyes, but honestly, if that means it&#x27;s working, I&#x27;m willing to deal with that for a while. I plan to update in a few months to see where this leads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 11/5/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, so I&#x27;m a little over three months in and on my fourth bottle. For whatever reason, the formula in my fourth bottle is noticeably yellower than the previous bottles, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any changed effect or anything. I use the Lipogaine twice a day: .5 mL in the morning and .75 mL at night. I&#x27;m using it only on my hairline, which has been slowly receding and thinning for about 6 years or so. I&#x27;m also using Regenepure DR and NT Shampoo every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this stuff is legit. I can&#x27;t say that my hairline has returned or anything, but the Lipogaine HAS grown new hair on my temples. The hairs are currently still very small, but they&#x27;ve been growing (SLOWLY) since I started with the treatment. I have no idea if they&#x27;ll ever become full-blown normal sized hairs, but new hair is new hair and I&#x27;ll take it. I was worried about the shedding phase for a little while during months 1 and 2 - seemed like there were some times that a pretty unusual amount of hair was falling out, but that totally stopped about a month ago and I don&#x27;t really think about it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to keep up with this for the indefinite future just to see what happens. Although the results so far have been minor, they have been positive, so I&#x27;m gonna stick with it.</li>
    <li> This is the first review i have written for any product that i have purchased through Amazon. I hope this review is useful to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman. Have been using Rogaine 2% since Jan 2010. Then switched to Rogaine 5% since September 2010. 2% worked fine initially but about after about 6 months the effects slowly started to decline so i switched to the 5%. Have been on the 5% for well over 2 years. Its no miracle worker but definitely helped reduce hair loss. It worked as advertised. Did not experience any massive dred sheds upon starting or while using Rogaine 2% or 5% for almost the 3 years i was exclusively on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading so many good reviews on Lipogaine i decided to make a change and give it a shot to see if it will work better than Rogaine. Ordered the 5% and strated using it from Nov 1st 2012. I have bottles of Rogaine liquid so used the Rogaine 5% in the mornings and the Lipogaine 5% in the evenings. Didnt really notice any  change for the first 3 and half months. No initial dred shed and that could be because i was already using Rogaine 5%. Nothing good or bad happen other than the fact that the Lipogaine definitely made my scalp more itchy and dirty faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going into end of Feb 2013, that&#x27;s the 4th month, i started noticing increase in hair loss after washing the hair. It accelerated during the course of March 2013, the 5th month of treatment. By the end of March hair was falling in clumps. This continued through April - now well into the 6th month. I&#x27;ve never experienced this while being exlusively on Rogaine. My system definitely doesnt like something about the change to Lipogaine. Whatever it is, is making me shed massively for the past 2 months now. At the end of April, i decided it was enough and stopped using the Lipogaine and stuck to Rogaine liquid twice a day. My scalp is already less itchier and more clean. The shed continues unfortunately. Its been a little over a week since i stopped using the Lipogaine.Am really hoping the shedding stop soon. As most of you know its not a great phase to go through :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that&#x27;s my experience on Lipogaine. I am happy for those of whom it worked. But i unfortunately did not have a good experience with it. I dont know if the Rogaine kept the sanity and thats why the dreaded reaction took a good 4 months to occur but really really hoping and praying this shed (we are taking clumps of hair folks) thats been going on for almost two months now will stop soon. I used Lipogaine for 6 months including the good 2 months at the tail end even after the shedding started to accelerate. I think that&#x27;s a long time to keep the sanity and continue using the product. I belive i gave the product a fair shot before giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to everyone!</li>
    <li> Although I was fortunate and didn&#x27;t lose my hair in clumps like some people do, I did notice that my hair was thinning over time and others were noticing it.  I am in my 50s and didn&#x27;t like the look that was developing!  After each haircut, I could see the thinning progress further.  The gal who cuts my hear had some products to sell, but they were big $$$s.  Finally I decided not to sit back and let it happen.  I researched available products that contained minoxidil (proven to work) and chose Lipogaine.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would make a difference for me, but wanted to give it 2-3 months before drawing a conclusion.  Now, I am able to look back at my &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture and note that my hair is actually becoming thicker and more vigorous.  I&#x27;m pleased by the results and have ordered more Lipogaine to make sure I am well stocked.  It is worth the small monthly expense to slow down and even reverse the process of hair thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the liquid medication dropper because I can distribute the solution where it is needed most and can then massage it in with my finger tips.  I try to avoid getting the hair wet with the solution, but rather get it primarily on the scalp.  I let it dry a bit more after the initial application (while brushing my teeth and shaving), then finish with light brushing and manipulation with my fingertips.  If I over wet the hair, it requires more manipulation subsequently to spread the hair and get good coverage and fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine has worked well for me and I am glad that I finally decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m pleased that there is a product which worked well for me, was cost effective and didn&#x27;t have any side effects.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best treament i have come across that treats and helps regain hair along the hairline, this is much more effective then rogaine, check out the ingredients! Biotin included another proven factor for hair restoration, been using this product for about 8 months now, seeing major results and i will continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> I truly like Lipogaine as a product and have been using it for a while, but I was disappointed with my recent purchase. My new order of Lipogaine had a very different formulation than the previous ones. It was a clear liquid instead of the typical yellow, and it smelled very strongly of alcohol. It also left my hair greasy and didn&#x27;t dry as quickly. I&#x27;m not sure if I just received part of a defective batch, but it was clearly NOT lipogaine. I&#x27;ll think twice before buying from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> lowers your libido, don&#x27;t buy, you also have to take this forever because the growth is not permanent ,  bad product</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for close to two years now,prior to that have been using Minoxidil (kirkland brand)for several years.The Lipogaine is definitely a step up from Minox.First of all it dries much faster and does not leave an oily film like Minoxidil.I find it well tolerated by my scalp as well.I pretty much have stabilized my hairline thanks to the Lipogaine(which currently is my only regimen for Male Pattern baldness) have not noticed major shedding in a year! Great product!</li>
    <li> Lipogaine has been very effective in regrowing my husband&#x27;s receding hairline. His routine begins with scrubbing the balding area with some Dawn dish detergent with a toothbrush, then derma rolling it. Then he applies the Lipogaine. It took about 6 weeks to see new growth but it really works. He now uses the Lipogaine daily on the regrown area and only derma rolls it once weekly.</li>
    <li> in an attempt to stop genes from taking over my head at the age of 23 i resorted to lipogaine, before purchase i did a lot of research and i felt confident with the comments.  I have been using this for a few months with at least a one time use a day and it has made all the difference in the world. i am still a little thin but its something you need to use constantly.</li>
    <li> I used this last spring/summer for 2 months. I used this in conjunction with getting back on my thyroid medication and getting tons of sun. I had the most hair I&#x27;ve had in a while (39 years old). An actual part. So I decided to get the rogaine foam because I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the dropper. 10 months later, my hair isn&#x27;t as thick as last summer. I&#x27;ve decided it was this stuff that made my hair thicker. i&#x27;m hoping they start making this in a foam version.</li>
    <li> Look man, since you&#x27;re here, I already know a few things about you. You&#x27;re losing your hair, and it&#x27;s bothering you. You&#x27;re not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing in my early 20s that my hair wasn&#x27;t what it used to be. standing under bright lights made it pretty clear to me that what once used to be a glorious forest of fluffy goodness was suddenly looking more sad and barren than I previously remembered. Stupidly, I decided to do nothing about it for a couple years, trying to convince myself it was all in my head, or that this was just fate. Something about committing to any sort of medication or product every day for the rest of your life seems like a scary thought at first that you just don&#x27;t want to deal with. The irony of that logic is that if you opt out, you&#x27;ll spend more time stressing and staring at your hairline in the bathroom every day than it would take to just put the oil on your head for 30 seconds a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I came around and got some lipogaine because it&#x27;s obviously the best minox on the market (read the label). it&#x27;s been something like 8 months and I can definitely say things have improved over that time - I feel pretty solid about what&#x27;s happening on top of my head. More importantly than the results however, is just the peace of mind. Get your minox, get the shampoo, find some finasteride, and if you really want to go nuts pull some strings and get some azelaic acid as well. At that point, it&#x27;s not even about how much hair you&#x27;ll have (which will be more than before), but rather the knowledge that you&#x27;re doing absolutely everything in your power to prevent the hands of time from turning. Once you take the leap you&#x27;ll find that you can go back to living life again without stressing things that were once out of your control.</li>
    <li> I have tried rogaine and Kirkland and this is the best yet. Seems to work better then anything I&#x27;ve tried yet. I have noticed less shedding and my hair seems healthier. The applicator that come with each bottle is good quality.</li>
    <li> Just realized my hair was falling off, at a much more rapid rate then before. Wasn&#x27;t sure what was wrong, until I found out the formula has changed. A key ingredient has been removed,  Azelaic Acid. For the price, you are better off with rogaine.</li>
    <li> This product irritated my skin and causing redness, itching, burning and blistering!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working.  Been using the product for somewhere around 7 or 8 months and while my hair isn&#x27;t as thick as it was before I started experiencing thinning, it&#x27;s noticeably thicker than before I started using lipogaine.  Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the negative results I&#x27;ve read about on the internet, no itching, no dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure yet if this is really going to &amp;#34;solve&amp;#34; the problem of hair thinning for me, but it certainly reduces it and I plan to keep using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Product has been effective in that it does encourage new growth in balding areas.  I have noticed that in one area, balding at the top and rear of my head (typical bald spot) there is no new growth, but new growth in the crown and front of hairline.  If I stop using the product (as I did once), the results go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was great, delivery prompt and as promised.</li>
    <li> Once I hit age fifty my hair decided that it was time I showed my age and began to thin rather noticeably and quickly for that matter. Having had rather thick hair for half a century, I was a bit alarmed, and a bit of vanity kicked in, and so I decided to see if there was something I could do about my thinning hair and gave this product a try. I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, and can attest to the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be on its quest to disappear, in fact I think it&#x27;s stopped thinning, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have the full head of hair of my youth, but I&#x27;ve been happy with the results of this product.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much new growth, but I&#x27;ve heard that comes with time, yet, there&#x27;s been no new loss, which is what I was concerned about, so, it works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 9 months and have had substantial hair growth on the front, top and back of my head. It takes some time (about 2-3 months) to see much growth, but it&#x27;s well worth it. I have some areas that have yet to see growth, but I think it will just take some more time. It&#x27;s easy to apply - although it can get your hair a little oily if you&#x27;re not careful to apply just to the scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old and I was experiencing thinning (balding) in the two front sides of my scalp.  I immediately started doing research in order to prevent this.  I have to say I am extremely satisfied with Lipogaine.  I have been using it twice a day for about 4 months now.  The thinning has stopped and I have regrown almost all my hair now.  This product has really saved me from the embarrassment of being so young and going bald.  The regrowth has been so much that all my friends have noticed and are impressed. I recommend this product to all my friends.  I have been taking regular vitamins for hair and nail growth combined with lipogaine and nizoral. Which btw the makers of Lipogaine also make a shampoo that has nizoral in it . It is called the Big 3 . I will also be trying that.  Give this product a shot for at least 4 months minimum.  Hair growth is a very lenghty process and you will not see results before then.  Thank god for this product.  I cannot praise it enough.</li>
    <li> I think this product is the best one out there.  There used to be higher strength minoxidil solutions available in the market, but seems the FDA has swooped in and eliminated them.  So for what is available this has been the best for me.  It has at least slowed or stopped the loss. For that reason it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years. I have had excellent results in that I have not had further hair loss and I have some increase in vertex hair as well. People actually notice the hair growth. It is easy to use and does not leave an oily residue in your hair. I use it in conjunction with Propecia and Reveta shampoo and conditioner. I highly recommend this product. It does work!</li>
    <li> I have used lipogaine pretty consistently twice a day for over a year. Within the first 3 months, I noticed improvement both in thickness and growth of new hair. My hairdresser noticed as well. After about 6-8 months, the improvement slowed or even stopped. Ever since, I have not noticed any new hair growth, and if anything, my hair seems to be thinning again. I&#x27;m not sure what changed, but the product just does not seem to be working like it used to. I&#x27;m continuing to use it, but because of the price, I am starting to look for other solutions.</li>
    <li> I have been using lipogaine for about a year.  It definitely helped slow an increasing problem of hair thinning.  Will continue until it stops working and will look for something else.  But at this point it is keeping the front pretty stable.</li>
    <li> Well, to be honest I was a little unsure at first, considering that there&#x27;s no much out there on hair treatment other then implant, but I&#x27;ve got surprised really. It&#x27;s been about 8 months since I started using Lipogaine after trying rogaine with no success, and I guess the reason it took a little longer than advetising is because my hair it is thin, but after all, I started to see some results and I&#x27;m very sure it will get better with the continue use of Lipogaine. I&#x27;m satisfied and really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Searched for &amp;#34;minoxidil without propylene glycol&amp;#34; and wasn&#x27;t listed as containing PG on this page, however, the second ingredient is in fact propylene glycol</li>
    <li> This product has improved my hair significantly on top and on both sides of the forehead.  I started using Lipogaine a years ago after noticing hair loss on top and at the receding lines and thinning at the front.  I have stopped loosing hair ever since I started using Lipogaine on both areas of my head and my hair looks fuller and thicker. If I hadn’t started using this product I can say that my receding lines would have been way back and I would have had a bold spot on top of my head but today you couldn’t even tell I had hair issues a year ago. I use it twice a day as recommended and I honestly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I only used the product a few times, so really dont know how good it works. I know that it is same as a bottle of super glue but way more expensive. When this stuff dries it is bad, leaves your head and hair with cement like feel, there is alot of better products out there.</li>
    <li> far better than rogaine, seeing results after just a couple months</li>
    <li> At first I thought that Lipogaine is just like the other hair regrowth therapies. .. but lately I realized that it&#x27;s different. .. I could see  good results ... my hair is growing back again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months now, and the results are really good. Just some background about me: Im an Indian male, 30 years old, and I have had hair thinning for about 5 or 6 years, and it has been more significant since 2012, and it was clearly a downer, as it changed my confidence and made me more conscious of my appearance. I started doing some research and found Toppik and along with some hair spray, it worked very well, and it covered up balding. But it never stopped the hair loss which is the root problem. So in mid 2014 I noticed that Toppik isn&#x27;t really helping, and others could see this stuff on my scalp. I searched for hair systems that you glue on your head, I checked with doctors for hair transplantation and none of them showed any real promise. Finally I decided I&#x27;ll give Lipogaine a try and move on to shaved head. This thing is amazing. I have taken pictures of my progress for the past 5 months, and I have gone through 3 bottles so far, and i will have to order another one in a week. Mind that I only used it once a day as I travel a lot for work, and it was hard to use twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using a hair wax with matte separation, from the 3rd month, and it worked really well giving some texture to my hair. And slowly my hair looked less balder and thinner. This is my first post here on Amazon, and I hope this helps someone who has the same issue as myself. This is definitely a confidence booster and I&#x27;d recommend it anyone who has thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First 2 pics are before using, Next 3 are after 1st bottle, next 2 are after 2nd bottle, and the last 2 are after 3rd bottle. I will post more updates soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 1 1/2 bottle, i see some peach fuzz growing in my front line, i&#x27;m happy with the results. I&#x27;m gonna keep using it until i look like Leonardo Dicaprio hair line.&lt;br /&gt;BTW i used before Profollica, the drops and the shampoo, and i thing i was a waste of money $200. I&#x27;m Happy with Lipogaine, i don&#x27;t give the 5 stars until my hair thickens.</li>
    <li> i have use it once last night, for side burns and hairline reseding. i only use in on one side of my hair to see the result, this morning a see a few hair start growing on the sideburn, nothing for the hairline yet. this product could be the real deal. i wait and post additional review later.</li>
    <li> I have used regular and extra strength and foam Rogaine, generic minoxidil, other products that I can&#x27;t remember the name, and none seemed to work too well. They would cause redness on my scalp, flakiness, one had an orange color to it which was embarrassing. They would also cause inflammation and I would get pimples (probably ingrown hairs) due to blockage around follicles along with the inflammation. These would also leave an oily residue resulting in a shiny scalp. Using this product in conjunction with Regenepure DR (a recommendation from a blogger) I have none of these side effects. My wife made a comment last night that my scalp isn&#x27;t looking shiny anymore. That could be due to new hairs coming in (light and thin peach fuzz type) and that this doesn&#x27;t leave scalp and hair feeling oily. Also no redness! I haven&#x27;t used this without Regenepure, which is suppose to help with redness and inflammation, so I can&#x27;t say that this on it&#x27;s own won&#x27;t cause redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product dries really fast, which is nice while getting ready in the morning. I have noticed that there is a residue on my scalp that I can scrape off with my nail. My wife seems to think it&#x27;s dead skin so I&#x27;m not sure. Either way it&#x27;s not noticeable and dries clear, so that&#x27;s good. If it dries on the hair, it seems to dry it out or get some weird texture. After it dries I put a little water on my hands and lightly run it across my hair to sort of rinse just the hairs with my head tilted so the water doesn&#x27;t rinse off my scalp. That has helped with the feel of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month or so of usage I am seeing results. At first it was a few hairs (even where my hairline was) that popped up here and there, sometimes seemingly overnight. After 3 months my wife and I can tell the receding hairs are moving forward towards the first lone hairs that popped up. Looking closely I can really tell the difference, although in my comparison pictures it&#x27;s not drastically noticeable since they&#x27;re longer light hairs right now. I&#x27;m thinking in a few more months those will get pushed out with thicker hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend a try!</li>
    <li> Have not seen any difference with my hair except for drying it out. I would not order it again, sorry.</li>
    <li> I used to be so satisfied with this product and I would only lose like 5 hairs total in shower and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since they took the Azelic acid out of the formula this thing is not effective anymore. Now I lose like 20 a day.</li>
    <li> I used the product for over a year starting 03/2013 and it did not work for me. Obviously not Impressed!</li>
    <li> I didn’t personally use this since I’m a woman and this is for men,at first I was going to but there were strong warnings against it on the box so I went ahead and gifted this to my father.He’s 86 and for sure balding,although he won’t admit it,I noticed ever since he has been using it his hair is more defined and its starting to grow more on the top of his head,which is where it was mostly gone from.He has been so happy with the results,and it makes him look a lot younger which hes really happy about.My dad is always saying how people tell him he looks younger,so now everyone will be really telling him he looks younger.I have used another one of there products,there lipogaine shampoo,which didn’t make me have any more hair but the thing I loved about it is that I really saw a ton less of my hair falling out while I was using this,both these products can be found on Amazon as well as there other products.They do cost a fair amount but all there products seem to work awesome,so the investment will be worth it.I as well as others I know have tried a ton of stuff for this issue and have had no results til now which is amazing,its way better than anything else on the market.my dad didn’t really dislike this product but he did not like the sticky and itchy sort of feeling it gives you at first but it goes away after using this a while,im assuming its because your scalp is getting used to it,he had no other complaints or side effects that I know of.</li>
    <li> I started to lose hair since I was 23. I used several different brands of straight 5% minxoidil for half a year. They were itchy, running on my face and took ages to dry. The worst part is that they didn’t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends recommended try Lipogaine. I was skeptical in the beginning. 3 months later, I am a believer. In 3 months, I&#x27;ve had hair coming back on my head in places (in frontal and vertex) that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was 20 (I am in early 30s). It&#x27;s steadily getting thicker and darker too.  I have enough hair now that I actually have to be concerned about styling it every morning for the first time in years. This is all after only 3 months, which isn&#x27;t very long  into Lipogaine&#x27;s full effectiveness. And, as I get more hair and grow it longer, I have more options to style and cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Lipogaine worked for me while other regular minoxidil failed.  It worked on both receding hairlines and frontal hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;This product has light yellow color. However, the yellow color is not noticeable at all after it is applied to the head. It does not smell, dries much faster than regular minoxidil, and does not cause itchiness as the regular minoxidil products do either.</li>
    <li> If your looking at these reviews you are probably in the same boat as many men; either your hairline is receding or your noticing your hair begin to thin out. I came across Lipogaine from a recommendation in a popular hairloss forum as an alternative to Rogaine. I have been using this product for over a year and while it took a few months, I did start to notice some regrowth along the temples. This went on for a couple months and eventually stopped. This isnt a cure, it&#x27;s not going to regrow everything but it&#x27;s the best thing we have available next to hair transplants or other more complicated alternatives (RU, Spiro, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, the re-growth has slowed (expected), and Lipogaine is helping to maintain what I have. If it can continue to do so, that is a win in my book. To help with the cost, I use Generic Rogaine Foam in the mornings and Lipogaine in the evening to make it last longer between purchases. Along with Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo and Finasteride, my hair loss has slowed and I have been able to maintain things since starting over a year ago.</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old and over the past 15 years (since my hair thinning really became noticeable) I tried Rogaine and the generic sold by Wal-Mart. I attempted to follow the directions of once a day but it caused my scalp to be irritated to the point that I had to dilute it with water to be able to just use it even every other day. After 6 months of use I saw no results and discontinued use of it.&lt;br /&gt;With Lipogaine for Men I was delighted to find it did not irritate my scalp - even though it says to use it twice daily. (Which I am doing.) Being realistic I did not expect new hair growth immediately. Things have to happen under the scalp first. For that reason I did not expect appreciable results for 4-6 months. I am pleased to report that after 5 months of use my hair is beginning to thicken in the areas I applied it. Based on what I have experienced with this product thus far I anticipate a solution in 7-9 months - to the point my hair coverage was 20-25 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Originally I began using this product at the first of this year. It is now the end of June, so I have a full 6-month experience with it. (Those who wrote they tried it for awhile and didn&#x27;t see any difference need to read-on here.) Six-months ago I told my hair stylist that I was using this product. Her comment was that a light massage is very important on each application. I have been doing that. Two weeks ago I was having my hair cut and I asked her if she saw any new growth. (The hair on top of my head has all been pretty-much the same length. About 5-inches. I let it grow that long to make more volume on top to cover the thin areas when I comb it straight back.) She took her comb and pulled a section of the treatment area of my hair straight up (like they do when they are about to cut-off the ends). She then pointed out that I had a crop of new hair that is 2-inches long, all over the treatment area. Although I had been unable to see any new growth when I looked in the mirror at home, I could see it then - very clearly. From what I have been told about the rate of growth of hair, everyone is a bit different, but 1/2\\&quot; per month might be a starting point. If that is true in my case, then the two inches of new growth equates to 4-months of new growth. In other words, there was nothing visible for two months after starting the treatment. Had I quit after 2 months I would have been making a premature decision that it wasn&#x27;t working. Now I know it surely IS working. Doing the math, again at 1/2\\&quot; per month, it will take about 6 more months for the new crop to catch up with the rest of my hair length. Needless to say, I am very pleased with this product., I could see it then - very clearly.

    <li> Have been using for 2 months. Good initial results indicating that good results can be achieved within a total period of 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have used Lipogain for about a year. I apply it only before I go to bed at night. I have noticed that it created new hairs on the front of my scalp. I think that it has slowed hair loss overall. It is hard to tell exactly what factors are responsible for hairloss and hair regrowth. I definitely noticed small wispy hair growth in the front regions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula for this product is much nicer than store brand ro-gain which I have tried. It applies easily and does not burn or itch too much after the first couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it is a little on the expensive side but using it once a day, at night, has kept the cost down for me. It is hard to use in the morning if you have longer hair like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and I&#x27;d say give it a try. Your head wont start growing hair like a chia pet but it will probably help a little.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for about 2 years. I wouldn&#x27;t have continued to buy it if it didn&#x27;t work. It does leave my hair somewhat crispy after I use it though. Expect better results with consistency of use. I began seeing results after 4 weeks. The 6 month mark was about the best it has ever looked. If you want to keep the little hair you have left for a couple more years, I say go for it!</li>
    <li> As with any hair gain product it&#x27;s difficult to know how you&#x27;d look if you didn&#x27;t use it, but as far as I can tell, this product works well.  I&#x27;m getting older and keeping my hair is a priority so I&#x27;m willing to try a few different products to find one that works.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and it seems to work well without any bad odor or color.</li>
    <li> i like it better than the walmart brand. dont know about all of the anti dht stuff that is also included in it. Its hard to get a really good assessment for this kind of stuff but it doesnt leave your hair oily and seems to work. Price isnt crazy either.</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old and thinning some on the top. I have been using this product for about two years.  It has stopped the thinning and filled in some areas.  I think that it does a great job, considering that I have the age thing working against me.  I have tried other products like this, including the big name product.  I like this better. I think it gives better results at a more reasonable price. I would recommend that you try this product if you are reading this review and looking at the product.  You need to be realistic, though. Do not expect the product to work overnight. You will not grow hair like Samson.  It is, however, a good product to help stem the tide of thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 5 months ago and have been hooked every since.  It has definitely helped improved the volume and thickness of my hair and has been noticed by friends and family.  The product does not leave greasy residue and is very convenient.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So like most everyone else here, before purchasing this product, I read through all of the reviews trying to filter out the bogus, overly positive, manufacturer-biased reviews from the actual product users who had something to say be it positive or negative.  At some point though, I think you just have to trust your gut.  In this case, it wasn&#x27;t difficult for me to decide to try since I&#x27;ve been using the plain 5% minoxidil for years now with only mediocre results.  Now to be fair, I would only apply the minoxidil solution once per day, rarely 2x, so I was only successful at preventing the remainder of my hair from falling out completely and not really encouraging new hair growth.  However, I&#x27;d been losing more hair recently so when I was running out of minoxidil this last time I decided to check other products and ran across Lypogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s extremely expensive compared to the Kirkland and Rogaine products and the Lypogaine bottles are the same size as their competitors (non-foaming) so about 3x as much $$ for one bottle (one month&#x27;s treatment), but the results speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a definite balding spot on the crown of my head but was also noticing a lot of thinning in the middle and front towards my forehead.  I took a before picture of the balding spot on my crown which I&#x27;ll post with a 2nd month photo update and a 3rd when I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first began to notice a change after about 2 weeks into applying Lypogaine.  I&#x27;ve been applying it to the entire top of my head from my hairline above my forehead in front to the balding spot on my crown.  The first change I noticed though, appeared as an extremely noticeable thinning in the hairline above my forehead and this really scared me...  Was the Lypogaine actually making my hair fall out???  It sure looked like it.  But I decided to continue the treatment anyway and give it a full month before making a decision to stop using the product (figured I was losing my hair anyway so what was the risk).  Over the next 2 weeks though, I realized that what initially appeared to be a thinning was actually a thickening; I was actually seeing hair regrow along my front hairline above my forehead that had receded years ago so it appeared thin at first but is now thicker, longer and filling in nicely.  It appears that I&#x27;m reclaiming my old hairline above my forehead and 5% minoxidil never gave me pause to even consider such a development.  Granted, my minoxidil use was only 1x per day, but to me, this seems like tangible evidence that something&#x27;s definitely different with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the other thinning spots on top and at the crown area, much like my front hairline although harder to recognize, I&#x27;ve noticed hundreds of new short, fine hair filling in the spots that have been thinning for years using just the 5% minoxidil.  I can&#x27;t tell yet if these fine hairs will finally grow in as a thick, healthy head of hair or if these fine hairs will fall out just like they have in the past while using 5% minoxidil but my experience so far tells me that this is different since I&#x27;m not seeing as much shedding as I&#x27;ve experienced in the past and my hair actually feels stronger and healthier now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historically, I&#x27;ve had very fine, thin hair and have grown accustomed to seeing hair on my towel after I&#x27;d dry it and then again on my hands after I&#x27;d apply the minoxidil.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 weeks now, my hair feels softer yet stronger when I wash it in the shower and then after I dry it and apply the solution I check my towel and hands and am noticing much less to no hair on them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes:  It&#x27;s difficult to apply this product without getting it into my hair and it makes my hair somewhat stiff and crunchy if I do.  If I brush it out, my hair&#x27;s at least pliable, but then the dried solution creates a fine powder that makes my hair seem dry and stiff.  I&#x27;ve found that there&#x27;s a techniqueto applying it to prevent this, but it seems that the longer my hair is the harder it is to control.  If I brush my hair to stand as upright as possible, then lower the dropper between the hair and use just my fingertips in a dabbing motion to carefully work it around the base of the follicles, it works much better than just spreading it around my scalp using the palm of my hand and allowing my hair to become saturated with it. Obviously, the more that gets in my hair the more solution I use and the faster I&#x27;ll go through a bottle.  And since I&#x27;m applying it to the entire top of my scalp, I&#x27;m already going through it faster than had I just been applying it to my crown area as the directions recommend.  I&#x27;m already about halfway finished with my second bottle now (about 5 weeks into using the product) and my plan is to continue using it for a total of 3 months and then make an educated decision on whether or not to continue it when I see those results.  As of now, I&#x27;ll be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, with all the exercising I do, I&#x27;m a big believer in taking supplements, so it must also be noted that as of about a week ago, I started taking [[ASIN:B000BY2N7S NOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg, 120 Vcaps]] and another hair-growth supplement [[ASIN:B0041JIANA Hairomega DHT Dht-blocking Hair Loss Supplement, 90-count Bottle, 45 Day Supply]] once per day (they recommend 2x per day which I&#x27;ll gradually work up to over a 2-3 week period).  Take these into consideration when evaluating my account of the product moving forward as it could potentially be a result of those supplements, although still used in conjunction with Lypogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and will continue to use it even if it costs me $60 per month to keep up the regimen provided the results continue to impress.  For this review, I gave Lypogaine five stars for the efficacy of the product but subtracted one star combined for both the product price and stiffness it causes when it getsin my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to update this review over the next 2 months and will post before and after photos for people to see my results and decide for themselves.</li>
    <li> I have just about finished my second bottle of this product. My hair was very fine but I still have most of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using the laser to go with this product. Between these two products my hair is coming back to a very thick hairs. I am very glad to see the results of these products working. I know if people will do it and do it right it will work for them also. If you want your hair people you can do something  about it with this product. I know I have read other peoples reviews and I know people think some of the reviews are fake. My review is not fake it works try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Tony</li>
    <li> Ive used it for 3wks now n my hair is falling the same. I apply 2wice a day n i noticed if i miss a hair wash i get a lot of shedding. Product has a lot of good reviews n im out of options so im continuing but so far nothing i got 2 bottles n will update if i see positive results. I could tell what i see is when it dries it leaves my scalp flacky n appears as dandruff. After shower it burns a little.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for a few months now. I have been very happy with the results and will continue to order Lipogaine. I have tried other products but this seems to work the best for me.  It&#x27;s 2016 and I am still using this product.. so far so good.</li>
    <li> This solution really does seem to work. I have been using it for close to a year now on the frontal area of my scalp (despite the indications that Minoxidil is not supposed to be effective on the hairline), and it has helped to regrow some hair and halt further hair loss. I like the Lipogaine solution because it includes a few other ingredients known to inhibit DHT and slow hair loss such as Saw Palmetto. I also like that it includes Retinol, which is supposed to increase scalp penetration of Minoxidil (apparently poor absorption through the scalp is one of the issues with topical Minoxidil). I like the peace of mind that Lipogaine&#x27;s Minoxidil solution gives me, and I plan on using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I works after using it for 4 weeks, I hair line started to get fuller, only once a day is necessary for me. I usually do it before sleep and wash it off in the morning.</li>
    <li> I had thinning on the top of my head, not on the crown, but a little behind the front hair line. It was getting very obvious and people where commenting. I did some research and decided on the following treatment regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day in the morning: shampoo with Pura d&#x27;or shampoo (available on Amazon)--leave on for at least 3 minutes for proper absorption (sometimes I use a second application) Then after scalp is dry apply 1 ml of Lipogaine, gently massaging into the scalp. It is important to cover the entire affected area. Take 10,000 mcg of Biotin by mouth and also take 540mg of Saw Palmetto (whole berry) by mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every night: Take one or two 540mg Saw Palmetto capsules(whole berry) and apply 1 ml of lipogaine to scalp and massage in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice a week: before shampooing with Pura d&#x27;or-- shampoo with T/Sal therapuetic shampoo. T/Sal will dissolve dead skin and other impurities from your scalp leaving  unblocked hair follicles. This allows better absorption of Lipogaine and the active ingredients in Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a week: apply Rene Furterer RF 80 serum (available on Amazon)to scalp after shampooing and allowing scalp to dry.This seemed to really stimulate hair growth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient! It took about 4 months, but the results were worth the wait. The first sign that the regimen was working was decreased shedding. Soon after beginning the regimen I noticed there was no hair on my hands after shampooing. Then actual hair growth started. The results were impressive. If you have any concerns with using this regimen please check with a healthcare professional.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost a year and all I can say is that I don&#x27;t see too much of my hair in the bathroom after the shower. So that proves that my hair is stronger now. I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have the same hair that when I was in the twenties, because many of my hair follicles are gone, but at least with the help of this product the remaining will last more than if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;m 38, fair haired. I have receeding hair at the forehead and a thin spot at the back of my head, also increased shedding.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using lipogaine for 2 months. I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth yet but the shedding has almost completely stopped, this in itself has helped my confidence, as a daily sprinkling of lost hairs was very demoralizing. I will stick with it for at least 6 months and am confident I&#x27;ll see new growth soon. Also taking biotin.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Compared to all the other hair loss products in the marketplace, Lipogaine is definitely my top choice. I have been using this product for over a year and it has helped me to keep the hair I have along with some new hair growth. I initially shaded lots of hair the first three weeks then my hair gotten really thick. I only apply it once and always before bedtime. Lipogaine recommends twice daily but it makes your scalp dry and hair to feel like dried straw. It also has a slight medicine type of smell to it. All in all, if your fighting hairloss, this is a great product and it works. Its a bit pricey but I think its worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product, I can see a difference after a few months and will continue to use it. It is well worth the money, give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have used this product now for about 6 weeks -switching from Rogaine Foam and I have to disagree with what many users are writing here for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Product is oily and stays that way on scalp regardless of how much is applied, the condition of my scalp or the method of application. .&lt;br /&gt;2) The price seems way out of line in comparison to Rogaine or the Kirkland brand foam which works equally well ( 6 cans @ $50).&lt;br /&gt;3) And finally but most importantly and the main reason for writing this review is I actually LOST hair since switching from Rogaine Foam.&lt;br /&gt;I know some users claim to see improvements -and maybe this is possible if you have never used minoxidil -but based on my experience I cannot recommend this product. The additional ingredients are also questionable. I would suggest if you want to try saw palmetto extract for example, purchase a high quality sample and apply it separately to see if there&#x27;s any results. I have tried this and cannot say I noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one year. I can definitely say this product works as advertised. After 3 months, I noticed that my hair was not falling any more. Now, my hair is thicker than 3 years ago. My wife can hardly tell that my hair is thinning. I started to lose hair 5 years. I don&#x27;t have any other family member who has hair loss issue. In the beginning I was trying to find easy solution by adjusting my diet and taking some herbal pills, I even tried Rogaine, but nothing seemed to stop my hair loss. I then did very extensive research and decided to try Lipogaine. The result is impressive. I will continue to use this product and hope to turn the clock back to 5 years ago.</li>
    <li> I have used many other brands (Kirkland, Regaine). Lipogaine gives the best results for me. Unit price wise it is more expensive than the other but it works for me. I use more than suggested doses though. 1ml on the forehead, 1ml on the top. Together with DHT blocker I take orally I see my hairline stopped receding. I didn&#x27;t get the hair to grow back as good as the product picture shows but stopped the receding is a big enough encouragement for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is they can create a subscription for regular buyers so the price will be a bit lower.</li>
    <li> This is SO MUCH better Than just using Minoxidil!  I have used Lipogaine for almost two years now, twice a day.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and had used just Minoxidil for a few years before switching.  Minoxidil gave a peach fuzz to the crown area which helped - but didn&#x27;t really grow hair that you could brush.  It reduced the &amp;#34;shiny spot.&amp;#34;  I tried Lipogaine instead and have never gone back.  The initial benefit is that the product soaks in fast and doesn&#x27;t rub off on pillows or keep hair it touches wet.  That in itself is worth the price!  The HAIR GROWTH is better than minoxidil.  This IS minoxidil 5% PLUS some other ingredients.  The hair growth by Lipogaine is thicker, though not my other normal hair thickness, and LONGER.  MOST IMPORTANT for me is that you can use this IN THE FRONT HAIRLINE OF THE SCALP and it works great!  I RECEDE NEAR THE TEMPLES ON THE FOREHEAD as well as the crown.  My hairline has been getting higher on my forehead for years.  I love this product because it grows hair up front.  I use a dropper in front all across the forehead and back to the scalp and one in the crown area so I go through a bottle in 2 weeks instead of a month.  But so worth it!  Nothing better on the market.  Give it a month and you&#x27;ll see peach fuzz.  Add two more months and you&#x27;ll see about an inch of hair you can comb.  A year and you&#x27;ll have some real new hair.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have some small growth and it has slowed my hair loss, so i feel it is about the best that i will see without going with more expensive measures.</li>
    <li> Cant say I see great results (after about 8 months of use now) but I dont seem to be getting worse.  It is easy to apply but can drip if you are not careful and when it does, it will leave a stain that is visible.  I think I am just the type that genetics will overcome anything I use but I will keep using this to see if I can maintain where I am for at least a few more years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years. While I don&#x27;t think it has caused any regrowth, it has stopped hair loss. So why am I giving it four stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this product doesn&#x27;t cause my scalp  to itch nonstop like other minoxidil products did (e.g. Rogaine). Second, it includes other ingredients that are supposed to help, such as biotin, saw palmetto, and B vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this product is a liquid and not foam application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this product is expensive relative to its competitors. With regards to whether to get this or a cheaper minoxidil item, I would consider how much value you place on non-itch and the extra ingredients I mentioned. personally, I think Lipogaine should be around the $15 price mark, but I pay extra mostly to avoid the itching.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well for me. I have early stages of frontal baldness.Been using this product for 2 years. certainly slowed down the amount of hair loss.</li>
    <li> Turns out this is nothing more than Minoxidil 5%.  I have tried it before under the brand name Rogaine.  That did nolt work and neither did this product.  It promises but does not deliver.</li>
    <li> ***UPDATE***  It has been 4 months since my review and a little less than 2 years since I first started using Lipogaine. Unfortunately, I can no longer stand by this product like I used to.     In the last few months I have noticed a failure of the product to maintain my hair and a quickening of the rate of my hairloss. In fact, I believe I am now losing hair in the crown area as well, which was completely full before recently. After a relative pointed out to me the hairloss on my crown, I also examined it myself for a couple of days and certainly saw more scalp there than what I&#x27;d seen normally before. So I decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to wait like last time and instead initiate minoxidil treatment immediately to mitigate DHT damages in the crown area as soon as possible. Yes, I am using lipogaine still for all of my head, and that is mainly because that&#x27;s what I had on hand and it is very convenient because it dries fast. But I think that now it is as good as any other minoxidil product out there, if not worse, since it is overpriced for what it does.     It pains me to say this because this product did miracles for me with the old formula. Literally, when I first started use, it miraculously grew hair for me before my very eyes, and not just any hair, but thick full dark hair. 3 months later, when they switched formulas due to pressure from big pharma (as rumor has it), lipogaine lost a lot of power as a product. It no longer did what it used to. But I continued using it because at least it was still able to maintain the hair I had on my head and I kept using it because this thing dries fast. But these past few months, lipogaine hasn&#x27;t even been able to maintain my hair. My routine hasn&#x27;t changed, except for maybe a different sleep pattern. I seriously doubt that is what triggered this new onslaught of DHT. My hypothesis is that since I&#x27;ve hit 25, my body has produced more 5 Alpha Reductase enzymes and that is taking more of my testosterone and changing it to thisdreadful DHT compound, which is starving my hair follicles. At this point DHT is winning this battle and I am not happy about it. Lipogaine isn&#x27;t strong enough.     I did also mention in the review below that I was using azelaic acid cream to replace this ingredient since it was removed from the old formula, but that unfortunately has done nothing for me. I&#x27;ve rubbed a bit of the azelaic acid cream on my head at night after applying the lipogaine minoxidil solution and letting it dry. I haven&#x27;t been very regular with it, but only because I saw no real improvements when I was using it regularly. Apparently, it&#x27;s not as good as it was when Lipogaine had it mixed in their solution. Or maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, I don&#x27;t know. Lipogaine removed it so now I have to make conjectures from my own experiences.     I also said that I was going to buy that Pura D&#x27;or shampoo with argan oil after my Vita Tres biotin shampoo was finished. I&#x27;m still going to do that because the argain oil I bought in bottle form from Pura D&#x27;or makes my hair feel soft, shiny, and look healthy. I doubt it&#x27;ll do anything meaningful about my DHT problem, but at least it contains all the right stuff that you usally like to see when you&#x27;re trying to fight hairloss. I will definitely put up a review of that product as well when I finish my first bottle.     I was sent a Lipogaine shampoo to try out also. I will open that tomorrow. I will post a review when the bottle is finished, which I anticipate won&#x27;t be for another 3 months. Other than that, at this point I am just hoping that the science on this continues to advance and that big pharma doesn&#x27;t strangle anything that threatens their rogaine and other big pharma products&#x27; profits. There are some new products out there on amazon with seemingly high ratings, though I&#x27;m not sure which ones are legit and which ones have fake reviews, and I&#x27;m not willing to shell out $60 a month to try them out. I&#x27;m hoping for something effective and affordable. Until a fewmonths ago that was Lipogaine. Now? Who knows...    TL;DR: Lipogaine was a godsend when it had Azelaic Acid, but when they changed their formula in Summer 2013, the product became pretty average. It was at least still able to maintain the hair on my head. Lately, however, ever since hitting 25, my hairloss has sped up (probably due to increased 5 alpha reductase enzyme production in my body) and Lipogaine hasn&#x27;t been particularly effective in holding it back. Thus I can no longer make the claim that \\&quot;it stopped my hairloss\\&quot;. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, to me now it is of equal value to other generic minoxidil products, except it dries faster and is more expensive. I will mostly likely buy Kirkland and use that at night to cut down on my Lipogaine expenses now.    ***ORIGINAL REVIEW***    I have been using this product for over 1.5 years. It has worked for me. I wouldn&#x27;t dish out $25 every month if I did not believe it was the single most important reason why I&#x27;ve been able to maintain hair in some areas of my head and grow it back in others. The biggest regret I have is not starting sooner because I would have been able to stop more hair from falling out.    A little bit about me... I am 25 years old and am a Norwood 2 on the scale. My hairloss started very early at age 16, but progressed slowly. I didn&#x27;t do anything about it until the age of 23, when I could no longer hide the bald spots on the left and right top corners of my head. I then did some research and bought my first bottle of Lipogaine. It&#x27;s been one of the smartest investments I&#x27;ve ever made. It works for me. It has largely stopped my hairloss on the left and right front corners of my head and it has restored all of my hair in the temple area. I recommend buying this product and trying it out for a minimum of 3-4 months to see if it will work for you too.    THE LONG VERSION    If you want to know more about my experiences and observations about this product in the 1.5 years I&#x27;ve used it, keep reading. Iwill write about some tips and observations about this product and other products I currently use.    OBSERVATION #1. The product WORKS, but has limitations. Is it able to STOP hair loss? For me, ABSOLUTELY YES (but every person is different). Is it able to GROW NEW hair? Well...KINDA. What I mean is that, in my experience, it can grow hair if the hair follicle in your scalp has not completely died out. In other words, if you have a completely bald spot that has been that way for the last two years, chances are that you will not get new hair growth there if you buy this product. The product inhibits harmful DHT hormones, thus allowing the existing follicles to grow mostly uninhibited. But it does NOT plant new follicles in your head. It is NO miracle cure, at least in my experience. What this treatment did for me is that all the hair that was ever going to grow back, grew within the first 3 to 4 months of using the product. After that, no new hair was growing. All the hair in my left and right temple area came back. 50% of the hair in my top right corner also came back. I wasn&#x27;t so lucky for the top left corner. That&#x27;s where I had the most dead follicles so only 10-15% of this hair grew back. But at least the remaining follicles grew thicker and stronger. I am happy with the results because at last now I can hide my bald spots in this area again. I SHOULD HAVE started this treatment as early as possible in order to prevent DHT damage to follicles that was irreversible before they died out. That is why here is my tip number one for you.    TIP #1: If you have already decided that you want to go down the minoxidil path for the rest of your life, start using this product ASAP, as early as possible. The longer you wait, the more damaged your follicles will become by DHT, until at one point the follicle will completely die out. When that happens, all the Minoxidil in the world won&#x27;t help you short of a hair transplant in that area of your head. So get on some sort of DHTblocker immediately if you don&#x27;t want to lose any more hair. I recommend using Lipogaine, but there&#x27;s much cheaper options on Amazon. Are they as effective? I don&#x27;t know. Are they as cleanly applied? No, Lipogaine has an advantage there if you have a busy schedule.    OBSERVATION #2: When you first start using the product, you will experience heavy shedding of hair. It will seem like the product is balding you even more. This is NORMAL and will go on for 2 to 3 weeks, if memory serves me right. It is a sign that the product is WORKING, so don&#x27;t freak out! As far as I understand, the reason why this happens is because the product speeds up the life cycle of some of these hairs, making them fall out initially. Don&#x27;t worry, they will soon be replaced by thicker versions of themselves. Stick with the product for at least 3 months before you chuck it completely saying that it doesn&#x27;t work.    TIP #2: Use the product DAILY, twice a day. I use it once in the morning when I wake up, and once at night before going to bed. I try to space out at least 8 hours between the two applications. Missing one application a day isn&#x27;t the end of the world (and I have missed one on many days), but you want to have the product be as effective as possible. I mean you&#x27;re spending $25 a month plus shipping for this little bottle. So try to stick to a set schedule. And be strict about it. To apply, use the dropper to pull out about 1.0 mL of Lipogaine solution and then apply directly to the scalp where you want your hair to stop falling and new hair to come out. Be sure your head is clean and dry. You want the liquid to seep into your scalp. Applying the product is a learning process, but soon you will get the hang of it. I put the dropper directly on the scalp so that as little as possible gets on my actual hair. You want your scalp, not your hair, to absorb this. If it starts to trickle down your forehead, just use a finger to gently rub it into the scalp. You want your scalp to be clean and dry for better absorption.    OBSERVATION #3: When you apply the product, you have about a 5 minute window until it dries, depending on how wet or dry your scalp is. The drier your head, the faster the product dries, which is good. You want a dry head of hair before applying the product so as to avoid the product climbing up on your hair follicles because it is being wasted there. Sometimes I will apply a little smidge to my actual hair because the product also acts as a gel and dries your hair in place. That&#x27;s a real plus so you don&#x27;t have to buy other harmful gel products, which I do not recommend that you use at all, especially if you have hairloss. Drop them right now and buy this product instead. This \\&quot;gelling\\&quot; ability is an advantage Lipogaine has over other minoxidil products.    TIP #3: Try to shower the product off every day after it has already dried on your scalp and been there for many hours. It has already served its purpose and you want to have the pores on your scalp be open and clean again for the new application of Lipogaine. I shower every morning. In my experience, if you just keep applying layer after layer of Lipogaine to the scalp without showering for more than two days, you will see that the product will start to flake off from your scalp and  it will look like you have dandruff on your hair. It will also become kind of whitish on your hair and make you look like you have grey hair. At this point, you definitely need to go take a shower.    OBSERVATION #4: About 4 months into my treatment I was experiencing faster hairloss and the gains seemed to be reversing slowly. When I dug deeper into it, it seemed like the company had changed the formula. The story is the FCC prohibited them from using azelaic acid. Lipogaine denies this, but when you compare the product labeling one key ingredient *Azelaic Acid* became \\&quot;DHT blocker proprietary blend with Azetinol\\&quot;, and there&#x27;s no denying that. Many people claim it&#x27;s basically still the same thing. I&#x27;m not so sure, but continued use with this new version has at least been able to maintain existing hair follicles for me and I have seen some new growth in the form of thin short hair follicles but I do not believe they will grow into full mature healthy hairs. But if I had to choose, I&#x27;d want the old formula back.    TIP #4: Use Lipogaine Minoxidil solution in conjunction with other products. When you do this, you fight DHT in more ways and have a better chance of recuperating your lost hair. I will list here what I use in order of priority from most potent and important to least important:     A) MINOXIDIL Solution. I recommend Lipogaine. Yes, this is the most important weapon in my arsenal of fighting hairloss. Even if you don&#x27;t have the money for Lipogaine, then at least buy some sort of minoxidil solution. The longer you wait, the worse it gets for you. Each bottle lasts 1 month used twice daily. Each bottle costs $25 for a total of $300 yearly.     B) KETOCONAZOLE Shampoo. An absolute must have for anyone with hairloss would be a ketoconazole shampoo. Ketoconazole is the active ingredient in shampoos that fight against dandruff, but it has been clinically proven to effectively fight against hairloss. For me it is very important to use a keto shampoo. I have used Lipogaine Big 3, Regenpure, and a few others. I recommend these two, but there&#x27;s other options on Amazon. They each cost about $25 plus shipping and generally last me about 3 months per bottle if used every morning in the shower. Yearly costs will run you $100.     C) AZELAIC ACID cream. Since Lipogaine no longer has azelaic acid in this form, I have bought the cream myself from eBay. Just search on eBay for it and you will see several options. I am using Skinoren 20%, but there&#x27;s other options. I do believe it makes a difference. I recently started (2 months ago) using it on my head and have seen improvement on areas of my head that seemed to be hopelessly gone forever. There&#x27;s short thin follicle sprouts in these areas. They probably won&#x27;t ever grow to full mature hairs, but this is evidence that Azelaic Acid blocks DHT on that part of the head where I need it to work. Azelaic Acid is actually an acne cream. You can buy the cream for maybe $20 and it can last about 4 months. I use it once every night, because it does dry your scalp, so I leave it overnight and shower it off in the morning. Then I don&#x27;t apply it again until the next night.  Yearly costs are about $60 + shipping.     D) MICRONEEDLE ROLLER. You can buy one from amazon for like $7 and it can last you up to a year. The one I bought has 1.5mm 540 needles. Why is it important to buy it? Well, because you can roll it on your scalp and create little microscopic incisions, which can make the lipogaine and azelaic acid better able to penetrate the skin and get deep in there to block the DHT under your scalp. I don&#x27;t recommend using more than once a day, but definitely more than 3 times a week, in my opinion. I spray alcohol to clean mine after each use. There&#x27;s an added bonus to the microneedle roller, which is that you can use it over your wrinkles to stimulate collagen production on your skin. Check out youtube videos about it.  If you buy two a year, it will cost you about $15 total.     E) ARGAN OIL (Pura D&#x27;Or). I feel like this product has helped nourish my hair more than just cosmetically. Certainly if you use azelaic acid on your scalp, it can dry the scalp. So I use this product every morning after I shower. After drying  my head, I put this on first, let dry for about 5 minutes and then apply Lipogaine. This product will last at least 4 months and costs about $20 on Amazon. Actually, when this bottle ends, I am considering buying the shampoo form of it and not buying the BIOTIN shampoo that I use in the shower addition to the Ketoconazole shampoo. But if you do want to buy this product (it has great amazon reviews), it will run you back about $60/year.     F) BIOTIN shampoo. I use the Nexxus VitaTres Biotin ONE and it makes my hair fuller and gives it biotin, which is essential to the health of your hair. I use two shampoos in the shower, the ketoconazole shampoo (Lipogaine or Regenpure) and the Biotin shampoo. As I said above, I&#x27;m thinking of swapping the biotin shampoo for the Pura D&#x27;Or argan oil shampoo. The Pura D&#x27;or shampoo is a bit more expensive, but then again I won&#x27;t have to buy the additional argan oil bottle. So I&#x27;d be spending less in total. But if you want a volumizing  to make your hair look fuller, consider this one. If you get the pack of two deal at $30, that&#x27;s all you need to spend for a full year, since each bottle lasts me about 6 months.     G) OTHER PRODUCTS. As you can see, there&#x27;s six products that I use on my hair listed in order of importance. I don&#x27;t necessarily think that you can&#x27;t stop your hairloss unless you use all of them. If you&#x27;re on a budget, just buy a cheaper minoxidil product and a ketoconazole shampoo and that alone will help considerably. But if you&#x27;re able to spend more, then consider these other products which I have tried and which have given me results to various degrees. They&#x27;re all well-regarded products on amazon. I have also bought biotin pills, but found that, apart from making my nails stronger, they didn&#x27;t have any visible effects on my hair, which is also why I will probably not buy the Biotin shampoo after I&#x27;m done with it and go straight for the Pura D&#x27;Or shampoo. Some people choose to take more drastic actions and ingest more potent pills like FINASTERIDE instead of sticking to the topical treatments like me. After doing some research on FINASTERIDE and reading that it could lead to impotence, I decided to steer clear of it. There is only a small chance that it will have this side-effect, but I am not willing to take that risk since my manhood is more important than my hairloss. Each person should do their own research on finasteride and all these other products I&#x27;ve listed above before making their own choices.    TIP #5: Now, since you have a listing of all my products I will tell you my daily routine.  Basically, I shower in the morning, first applying the KETOCONAZOLE shampoo and leaving it for about 4-5 minutes on my head while in the shower. I usually brush my teeth or scrub my body in the meantime. Then I rinse the Ketoconazole off and apply the BIOTIN shampoo. As I said above, I will probably swap this with the Pura D&#x27;Or in the future.  I use this second shampoo as a conditioner. Leave it on for 2-3 minutes and then rinse your hair out completely. After jumping out of the shower and drying my hair as well as I can, I apply the ARGAN Oil. I leave that for five minutes and then apply the LIPOGAINE and quickly style my hair.    At night, if my hair is stuck in place due to the minoxidil, I will wet my hair and gently rinse it off. After drying it, I take my microneedle roller, sterilize it in alcohol, rinse, and then apply the microneedle to my scalp in a diagonal fashion. I sterilize it again after I&#x27;m finished with it and then apply LIPOGAINE. After 3-5 minutes I will take just a little smidge of AZELAIC acid cream and rub it into my scalp. I put the azelaic acid second on my scalp because I don&#x27;t want my pores to be blocked by it.    OBSERVATION #5: Before you buy this product you have to think long and hard. This is something that once you start, you have to stick with it for life or at least until science and medicine find a better solution to hairloss. If you stop using it, all the hair you were able to save during all this time will eventually fall off. That&#x27;s a waste of money and money is important factor here. The yearly costs for this hair treatment come out to be around a minimum of $300 plus shipping at $25 a month per bottle of Lipogaine, and this is just for the minoxidil treatment alone! You gotta think long and hard if that&#x27;s something you can afford. And if you want to buy the other products I suggested, costs will run you back $600 every year. This is definitely something you want to keep in mind. I always buy products in bulk so as to get free shipping from amazon.    CONCLUSION: I have been using the product for over 1.5 YEARS. The product WORKS, although it is more effective at STOPPING hairloss than REVERSING it. Hairloss for me has almost completely stopped and I was also lucky to experience some new growth, but for areas where I had been bald a long time, there were no results, although some of these areas do show thin hairs about a quarter of an inch long, but I do not believe that they will grow to mature hairs.    You will experience heavy shedding INITIALLY. This is NORMAL and it means the product is working. This hair will come back soon in a fuller and stronger form. Stick with the product for at least THREE MONTHS before saying it doesn&#x27;t work. Apply Lipogaine DAILY to a DRY scalp, 1 mL TWICE A DAY with at least 8 HOURS apart between each application. Shampoo your hair daily. I would encourage you to use the OTHER products I mentioned above so that you have a better chance of fighting DHT, stopping hairloss, and getting back new hairs. The product dries fast and can serve as a type of GEL. Do not use other styling products on your hair.    Think long and had if this is something that you want to go into. Once you start the treatment, you CANNOT STOP or the hair that you gained while on the treatment will fall off. COSTS per year for this product are at least $300. Try to get deals for FREE SHIPPING by buying in bulk. For me the costs are totally worth the head of hair that I have now and I do not regret going down this path. My biggest regret is not starting SOONER because I could have saved more hair follicles before they died out completely. Hope this review helps you make your own decision. GOOD LUCK with your hair loss.</li>
    <li> While I only just started using this product and don&#x27;t yet know it&#x27;s effectiveness, the application leaves a great deal to be desired.  It goes on wet, but when dry your (remaining) hair becomes harder than any gel, cream, or foam you&#x27;ve ever used.  You can&#x27;t get a comb through it.  And worse, through out the day it begins to flake off giving the appearance of dandruff.  Surely there&#x27;s a better way to regrow hair than this.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have ever tried! It cotains more DHT blocking ingrediants than anything on the market. And, at a reasonable price, it has given me better results than very expensive and painfull hair transplants. It is easy to purchase and easy to use. Any man out there who is losing hair has to try lipogaine.</li>
    <li> Product has seemed to help slow hair loss. Not as greasy as other products and I&#x27;ve had no side effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a month and a half. I&#x27;ve seen little hair regrowth but not much.&lt;br /&gt;But it dries very fast and is by far the best topical solution I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have used lipogain for over a year works great. my hair was very thin an receding would highly recommend to anyone. I use it twice daily morning and night with remarkable results. You must be patient and give it time to work.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine has worked for me- not so much as growing hair, but effectively keeping the hair I still have.  I switched from DS Labs to Lipogaine about 6 months ago...the Lipogaine formula is quickly absorbed, and is compatible with the other products I use...all at a very reasonable price via Amazon.com.  Hopefully in another 6 months I will see some vellum hair growth too....</li>
    <li> This product really works for me. It reduces significant amount of hair loss when I use it. I think that Lipogaine is best for people who are starting to have a receding hairline. The only thing to prevent the hair loss (or reduce it significantly) though is to keep on using this stuff or otherwise the hair loss will become very obvious about a month or so after stopping the usage of this product.</li>
    <li> Did &#x27;nt work for me!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Rogain, Rogain foam, and Provilus. Now Lipogaine. Used all of these for 8 months or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine works, but not that great. It takes the longest to dry. About three to four hours. I had slight baby hair regrowth. Dries out the scalp terribly and leaves a lot of flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine foam works as well as Rogaine does,  but it dries VERY fast. Only difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provilus. Works perhaps a tiny bit better than Rogaine, but not much. Dries a lot faster, but plan on at least an hour. Not much improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine. THIS STUFF WORKS. At first I my hair thinned a little, but I expected this and stuck with it. I have used this now for about 6 months, less than the others, but have seen dramatic improvements. I have male pattern baldness caused by DHT (testosterone converted to dihydrotestosterone) which is the main cause of my hair loss. I have a high testosterone level. My hair loss is in the front mostly, on the crown of the head. A receding hair line if you will. It will not grow all your hair back, but it has grown quite a bit, and works far better than anything I have used. I am very skeptical of all pharmaceutical products, but much to my surprise, this one actually does what it says it will do. Don&#x27;t expect a full head of hair, but expect somewhat significant regrowth. Be wary of pills like finasteride (Propecia). It caused sexual dysfunction in me long after I took it. It took me two years to get mostly back to normal. Never thought a pill could do something that serious in only 5 months of taking it, and it doesn&#x27;t do it to everyone, but it did that to me. Me testosterone level dropped from 700 to 150 while on it causing tiredness, lack of energy, inability to ejaculate, loss of libido and sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine dries in about an hour to two hours and has caused no itching or flakiness much to my surprise. Love it.</li>
    <li> After searching for the best minoxidil, DHT-suppressive, combination product for years, I settled on Lipogaine. I use it, and both my sons use it. I would not recommend it to them if it wasn&#x27;t the best product in the market.  Use is consistently for 3-6 months, and the result will speak for itself.</li>
    <li> Just when I was about to give up hope with all the products out there I gave Lipogaine a try and was thrilled that it was actually giving me results.  It has been a few years now and I use it twice a day and maintain my hair count.  Can&#x27;t recommend Lipogaine enough!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for about six months, and the product is not always the same quality. Last one had a brighter color, and it was more sticky than usual. This is the second time this happened. Other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I am somewhat satisfied with this product. I am 23 years old and my hair has always been very fine/thin. Unfortunately, about a year ago it started thinning. At first I thought, &amp;#34;Well as long as I have some hair until I&#x27;m married...&amp;#34; but in the last 3-4 months the rate of hair loss started increasing rapidly. So much so that I started getting worried I would be bald before 25. So I started researching different treatments. I didn&#x27;t really want to take any pills (Propecia) so I started looking into Rogaine like treatments. I found this on amazon and it had fairly good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My experience with it has been mixed. Before I started using it my hair was thinning rapidly and the hair on the top of my head had virtually stopped growing. I had gone from a hair cut every 2 weeks to one every month (and even then only because the hair on the side/back of my head needed cutting not the top!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So I started using this Lipogaine thing. I used the recommended 1ml (handy dropper) and pretty much applied it all over the top of my head. Sometimes I would use a little more than 1ml. I have been doing this at least once a day for  about a month. In that time I have noticed a significant increase in the rate of growth. The hair on top my head is growing rapidly and I am back to my every 2-3 week hair cut. BUT their is no NEW growth (at least as far as I can tell). My hair is still very thin and I have not gained back what I lost. I don&#x27;t know if my results will change if I continue using this product, but I plan on using it indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this product is a stop loss measure. You might not get new growth but it will help you keep what you have (I just wish I had started earlier).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this PM and using regular minoxidil in the AM, due to the nature of Lipogaine looking and feeling a little \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; in your hair when it dries.  Noticing a modest improvement in the overall thickness of my hair after 3-4 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Still getting great results. I&#x27;ve now followed the routine for about 8 months, I&#x27;ve stopped shedding hair in the shower, overall feels thicker to me. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> 2 Months Update. I started using this product two months back. Still having massive shedding loosing more than 200 hairs every day.&lt;br /&gt;I can clearly see my scalp. I am having lot less hairs when I started with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and see if it is bringing back my stolen hairs.</li>
    <li> With my aggressive research.. I have came to this point which I believe is the best product for hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I tried many-many products but Lipogaine is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I have many experience with Minoxidil products- Rogaine - Perfect image solutions 15% - which was the best. But now Lipogaine is the best- it ranks #2 in beauty and hair growth on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally the money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;I can see on my crown that hair is regrowing and plus a little bit on my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;I have using it for about 4 months already and it is ten times better than Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using generic finastride orally and thats a plus too.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine has really helped to prevent my hair from falling out so far.  I have been using the product for about 4 months now and my hair has stopped falling out. At first I may have experienced a slight increase in hair loss, but I understand that is normal with all hair loss rejuvenation products as the old hair is shed and new hair grows.  I am no experiencing slight hair growth and it is not falling out.  This is very encouraging. Just be patient. My hair didn&#x27;t all fall out over night so I do not expect to grow a head of hair over night like I had in my 20s. So far I rate this product an A, and I anticipate I will give it an A+ in the future if these hairs continue to fill in my bald areas.  I will most definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I love it, my hair got significantly thicker after about six months, completely recommend it. Thank You Lipogaine!</li>
    <li> I used the product for some time, I really didnt find much difference. I discontinued using it as I figured it is not for me.</li>
    <li> It works people. Use it.</li>
    <li> This product works fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using romaine for years, and have been using this product for quite some time.  I can tell the difference. Sometimes it is so strong my head constantly itches. At other times, as recently, it is little more than colored water. No itching. Hair begins to fall out in hour after hour. I don&#x27;t know if this product is made in their bathtub, but it needs to be regulated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year with good results, I will recommend it!</li>
    <li> I originally bought it to try to fix a patchy spot in my beard.&lt;br /&gt;It caused some skin issues for me after a few days of use: red bumps on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it up for a while, then tried again, but they came back.&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> You can read about other people&#x27;s results of Lipogaine as it pertains to hair growth. I want to talk about how Lipogaine CURED my dandruff problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have that severe dandruff problem that often afflicts guys who are losing their hair (I&#x27;ve always had a bad dandruff problem and only got worse when I started losing my hair at age 25). Losing hair I can deal with (I ain&#x27;t vain that way, and I shave my head bald anyway) but the dandruff and the associated rash, redness, scalp pain, itching and of course flaking is something I don&#x27;t favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I of course started off using Head and Shoulders, which kinda sorta kept my scalp condition in control. Then I heard of Nizoral and started using that for years. It is expensive ($14-17/bottle) but man all the pain and suffering of my poor scalp went away. Nizoral did however dry my scalp out and for some reason I would get an occasional headache from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then read of Lipogaine, which although primarily for hair loss, also works real well for severe dandruff problems like I have. It is hella expensive for such a small bottle ($25). But at least now  i can wear dark shirts without me flaking all over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5+ months I must say that I have ZERO symptoms of dandruff, or side effects like Nizoral was giving me (the headaches).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cost, this is pretty reasonable compared to other treatments that propose to address dandruff problems. This is a lot more convenient than getting a prescription for some topical medicine. And hey, while it&#x27;s addressing my dandruff problem, hopefully I won&#x27;t lose any more hair (and maybe grow it back like it says it can).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, on Lipogaine&#x27;s primary use as a hair regrowth treatment: I have not noticed any hair re-growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for about a year along with Pura d&#x27;Or shampoo. In that time I have seen my hair loss reverse slightly and I have maintained the hair without losing more. At this point Lipogaine is helping me keep what I have and I consider that a win. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product, helps you sustain what you currently have and minimizes shedding. Does not leave scalp dry and itchy unlike other minoxil products, which was a an issue with Rogaine. Overall a quality product and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Messy and so I stopped using, but it may have worked just fine. I switched to rogain fome and I got new hair growth after 3 months!</li>
    <li> Followed instructions for quite some time and nothing</li>
    <li> This product leaves the hair in the area treated sort of rough and stiff feeling even after dry. Can&#x27;t really see any growth to the front or top, but I have not been using the product for that long yet. If good result, I will update review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using Lipogaine for the last 2years...before that I was on another product causing me a lot of itches and giving me very slow results.I did a research in Lipogaine and liked the combination of the oils that do really work for the itching part...after the first three months I could see hair growing on parts of my head that was going to be empty...I&#x27;m 36 years old and I thought that losing hair might be irreversible but nevertheless my head becomes like when I was 25!!!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;I also take care of my diet with all the vitamins and minerals in balance and a good shampoo for the moisture!&lt;br /&gt;Very strict in the two doses,one per twelve hours daily and everything seems to work fantastic.New hair are growing the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;In between a year I will post photos of comparison...I&#x27;m happy!!!</li>
    <li> This product forced me to do the unusual, leaving a feedback. To start with there are no application directions, and I had to do a lot of researching before buying this. The 4-start reviews here were also a selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since started using, I noticed a lot of hair fall. I dint loose hope and kept using it, but it would not stop!!  My understanding is, there will be an initial period where the hair fall is inevitable and slowly you stop noticing it improve with the usage, and the hair growth. The rate of falling never receded (may be even increased sometimes) with me approaching 30 day mark. I am discontinuing right away and going back to rogaine. Wate of time, money and effort. For a product this expensive one would hope a decent usage instructions.</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market for hair loss,&lt;br /&gt;I tried the cheaper alternatives (Kirkland minoxidil) and my hair got dramatically worse,&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine is definitely my go to treatment now.</li>
    <li> Been using it for 18 mos., with excellent results.</li>
    <li> Fifty two years old. I was on finasteride for over ten years.  A little over a year ago, I got scared from everything I had read about it, so I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year later, after not paying much attention for a while, I began to notice the hair left in the bathtub and I finally looked at my head.  Wow!  I was going bald in a hurry! (no hair left in the crown area and rapidly moving in the typical horseshoe shape toward the front)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do something about it.  I read the reviews on Lipogaine on Amazon and I decided to give it a try in combination with Nizoral shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started three and a half months ago, applying Lipogaine religiously in the morning and at night, and shampooing with Nizoral every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I can say for sure, is that the hair loss has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still unsure if I am growing hair or not.  Sometimes it looks like I am, but particularly when my hair is wet, I am not so sure.  The pictures are not so clear as to convince me either way, yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lipogaine itself does help give the appearance of fuller hair when it is dry.  It is a little greasy after you apply it, but it goes away and into crunchy territory after a couple of hours.  Not too bad.  Not worse than if you had hair gel, and if you towel your hair or run your hands through your hair once is dry and brush it again, the crunch goes away and it feels natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely continue the treatment for a few more months.  I do see progress and feel three and a half months is not long enough to be totally sure as of what is going on up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars because I do see progress, even if it is just stopping further loss and making my hair look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still optimistic that this may in fact works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely update this and follow up with before and after pictures at the six month mark.</li>
    <li> Hi..  I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for 3 years and it definetely has slowed down hair loss.  I also take the finesteride pills.  I still have a full head of hair!  It&#x27;s a little thinner over time as I age, but it&#x27;s all there.  (I hope one day, a stronger FDA approved formula will be allowed.  This is a regulation that affects all vendors).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 months now and have noticed my hair is thicker and does not fall out as much.  I will continue to use this in hopes to see even better results.</li>
    <li> Be careful using this product. Can make you feel disorientated when you over apply for a period of time, especially if you apply after a hot bath.</li>
    <li> I am a 38 year old with a family history of male pattern baldness. After 6 months of twice daily use, I feel I have had sufficient time to give an accurate review of Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;  Before trying this product I had been using a lower priced generic brand minoxidil. I don&#x27;t recall having had much regrowth using it, but was overwhelmed by the side effects. Dandruff, scalp itch and minor eye irritation during application were experienced for months. Those negative issues led me to try the better recommended minoxidil brand of Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;  The first thing I noticed when I used it was how quickly it dried. The previous product I used would be quite greasy and inconvenient to use due to the drying time. Not the case with this product. Scalp health was the next thing I became aware of. The dandruff issues and scalp itch went away soon after quitting the generic minoxidil. They did not return with the use of Lipogaine, so I was thrilled about that.&lt;br /&gt;And now as far as results.......the results have been good. I began using minoxidil late into my hair loss, so I can&#x27;t blame any product for not giving me tremendous results. My crown area does appear somewhat darker than when I began, so It must be working. Where I have seen great improvement is in actually keeping my hair. I usually wash my hair over the bathroom sink to see how much I lose over the contrast of the white sink. I&#x27;ve been seeing less and less over time. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;  The only thing I did not like about Lipogaine is a trivial issue.........the applicator or &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34;. It is a nice quality glass applicator, but I find it either applies too much or too little. It was not as effective as the cheap plastic applicator that came with my previous generic brand minoxidil. One of these applicators even fell onto my bathroom tile floor and sustained a chip.&lt;br /&gt;  I feel that it&#x27;s worth paying a little more for a highly regarded product that will give you better results and less side effects. Lipogaine is one of those products that will continue to be a part of my hair care regimen for years to come.</li>
    <li> Did nothing but took my money.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because the box is red and white, and I like peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got to say, folks.</li>
    <li> I am using this  product for 3 months now and i can said that i am very pleased with it. I started to notice changes on my hair 7 weeks after i started to use it and now the difference is obvious. No side effects so far. I feel my hair is much stronger than before. I hardly see any lost hair when I take shower. I used some other minoxidil products; I can say that this is the best hair lost product i have used so far. The price is acceptable to.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it carefully as it stated and during the time I decided to throw in the towel, I decided not to use it any more… I saw more videos and YouTube and herd of &amp;#34;Minoxidil 5% EQUATE&amp;#34;. I saw videos of men using this as I was amazed how much this works! Guys if you want your hair back in a matter of time. Use Equate - Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength. You can get this for 18 bucks at WalMart. I promise and assure you its worth the price! After 10 days of using it, I was growing my hair back I kid you NOT! Take my word or not. Everything is based on beliefs… but my belief is true. Now it states on some YouTube videos your hair will shed like crazy!!! The first day I used it. I shaved my head and became bald. literally 10 days afterwards I was regrowing missing and thinning hair on my bald spots. This stuff does work! And I did not shed hair at all, in fact it started growing more and more even when shaved! Make your purchase wisely guys…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minoxidil 5% will be your best friend! - use it everyday for the rest of your life if you wish to look good! Important note! Best of luck</li>
    <li> Compared to the generics or liquid Rogaine, this is clearly the best available product. No, its not a cure all, but delivers better results without the itchy and painful scalp.</li>
    <li> best for hair regrowth in order for it to be use to its full use it everyday like on the instructions helped regrow my hair tht was thinning away</li>
    <li> I have been thinning for a few years now. I have been using Lipogaine for men for about 2 years. It really  works by stopping the thinning process. It actually makes the hair fuller. Great product over all.</li>
    <li> I had written an earlier review of this product singing it&#x27;s praises. So much so that I&#x27;m sure many people thought my review was fake. It wasn&#x27;t. I had fantastic results with the old Lipogaine formula. After three months of using&lt;br /&gt;the new blend, I&#x27;m hear to say that this is no longer the miracle juice it once was. All the gains I had from the old formula are slowly shrinking away, even with constant religious use of the new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that Lipogaine is still the best minoxidil solution out there, but it has lost it&#x27;s ability to block DHT, do no doubt from the removal and or alteration of the Azelaic Acid ingredient. I&#x27;m sorry but \\&quot;Azetinol\\&quot;, is not effective like pure Azelaic acid. And before someone starts spouting off about AA&#x27;s lack of clinical research, I&#x27;ve used it. I know it works. And so do countless other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the FDA took Azelaic Acid off the \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; list, which is why it was removed from the Lipogaine formula. It&#x27;s a real bummer. You find something that really works, something that gets your hopes up, and then BAM, gone. It doesn&#x27;t matter to me anymore because I&#x27;ve found an alternative source of Azelaic Acid. I&#x27;ve done enough reading and research to finally find the magic combination for MY hair restoration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Minoxidil: twice per day&lt;br /&gt;-20 % Azelaic Acid cream: once per day&lt;br /&gt;-1.5 mm micro-needle roller: once per day&lt;br /&gt;-ketoconazole shampoo: once per day&lt;br /&gt;-Hairmax laser comb: 2-3 times per week&lt;br /&gt;-Hair vitamins: biotin, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my alternative to the treasured \\&quot;old\\&quot; lipogaine formula. Good luck fellas, wish I had better news.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and I have to say it works well.  You have to be consistent with the use and I recommend that you use a microneedle roller for the scalp.  Lipogaine is a bit more expensive than the other brands, but I believe it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles of this product and have been using more than a month. Still there is no improvement and I am waiting. The problem with the order is although I ordered two bottles, I got only one dropper. How do you know that I bought both of the bottles for me? How much a dropper costs? Seriously, is this company that cheap?</li>
    <li> I have used once daily for over 6 months without any improvement for recessing hair line. It is easy to apply, odorless, and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  Left hair like straw and lifeless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had good results with Lipogaine for Men. I have used it for over a year to treat thinning hair in the crown area of my head. It has regrown my hair so that the bald spot is no longer obvious. It does not dry out my scalp or cause redness as other name brand minoxidil products that I&#x27;ve used in the past do. There is still some dryness/flaking but nowhere near the extent of other products. A very good product and I&#x27;m glad it is available.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It has not helped me regrow hair, but no minoxidil product our there has been able to do that for me. I have tried rogaine, among others, and they all made my hair crusty and shed a lot. Lipogaine has not done that. It has helped the hair I do have appear to be a little bit thicker and has helped prevented further hair loss. I will continue to use this, because to me, it&#x27;s worth the $25/mo to keep the hair I have and prevent further hair loss.</li>
    <li> I Have been using Lipogaine for a couple of years and it has kept my hair loss at bay. Without it I would have lost a lot more hair, but it minimizes the loss and helps grow back hair. I always make sure that I have some on hand to use daily, even when I travel. It contains Minoxidil which is the main ingredient that most male pattern hair loss products have, but it also contains a multitude of other ingredients that in my opinion make it especially effective.</li>
    <li> I am not trying to grow all of my hair back:-) I am hoping to keep what I have for a while longer:-)</li>
    <li> Product appears to of helped the thinking of my hair.  There is much less falling, allowing growth to happen.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine definitely makes a difference. The product is easy to apply and effective after several months of use. Around the 3 month mark I noticed less hair coming out in the shower. After about 8 months my hair looked more full. My only complaint really is that azelaic acid was removed from the formula. I sometimes question if the new formula is as effective as the older one with azelaic acid. Nevertheless I would still recommend this product to any of you guys on the fence about hair loss products. It worked for me and can work for you.</li>
    <li> Not recommended , make erection dysfunction .&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try it.&lt;br /&gt;I was use it for 6 months ago and iam suffering now.</li>
    <li> I tried it the first time 5 month ago. The first bottle was good. I could see some hairs grow out. I was exited about that. At first I applied twice a day, then I applied only before going bed. However, it did work still.&lt;br /&gt;Weeks later, somehow I felt headache during night when I applied it. I didn&#x27;t know why. However, I continued to use that, cause it was effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after two months, the first bottle ran out. So I ordered  two more.&lt;br /&gt;When I received them, the first thing I notices was: the expire date was about a year or half a year earlier than the first one.&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed was: the liquid was kind of diluted than the first.&lt;br /&gt;The third thing I noticed was: I did not have headache while applying this, which was good.&lt;br /&gt;But the fourth thing I notice was: It did not work well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I suspect that they shipped their former products to me, which did not work well...I had the feeling of being deceived the second time I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have given more stars. But I couldn&#x27;t. I wonder if anyone else has similar experience as mine?</li>
    <li> This is a very effective treatment for hair loss. I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably over a year and within the first few weeks, I noticed a good amount of new hair growing. I have thin and fine hair - never had a lot, but as I get older it was getting a little thinner. This product reversed any loss and actually made my hair fuller than it ever was.</li>
    <li> I have always had thin hair but noticed one day that my hairline along with the crown of my head was starting to look a little bit more thin.  Luckily, Lipogaine was the first product that I tried.  I didn&#x27;t notice a change right away but then noticed after several weeks of use that my hair appeared thicker and was not thinning anymore.  After using Lipogaine for approximately one year, I decided to change to Rogaine foam to see what it would do for me.  After a month of using Rogaine, my hairline was receding again.  I thought it was the initial phase where you lose hair before starting to grow new hair but this phase never started.  After using Rogaine for 3 months I had lost some ground and decided to switch back to the Lipogaine.  I have now been using Lipogaine for 4-5 months straight and have regained the ground I lost with Rogaine foam.  I have decided to stick with what works!&lt;br /&gt;Personally I have no problems with Lipogaine.  No irritation, smell or any other problems.  It actually works well with my hair paste that I use for styling.  It&#x27;s honestly worth using to maintain the hair that you already have.  I can&#x27;t say that I have grown new hair but am very happy with my results. I do not feel like I am losing hair now.</li>
    <li> Awesome&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I have used Lipogaine for two years now. I first began using it in July of 2013 and began noticing effects after about three weeks. My hair began to fall out. BUT this is a GOOD thing. It is a good indication that the product is working. Once the follicles are stimulated enough to start regrowing hair, they will push the thinner and dead strand out in favor of a newer thicker strand growing underneath. I&#x27;d say after 2 months (looking at before and after pictures) my hair started to regrow. Maximum effect was probably visible after 3 to 4 months. Lipogaine definitely worked to a degree. Its not a solution to hair loss but certainly can regrow hair a little bit and halt further hair loss. The beneficial effects will start to taper off though I think after about a year, which may suggest that cycles of treatment may be the most optimal way to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for Men for over a year and it&#x27;s a good product. It works without&lt;br /&gt;making hair too sticky. Recently, I tried Big-3 shampoo as well and it seems to work and&lt;br /&gt;also, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry-out&amp;#34; the hair too much, like some other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( I wish they could make it with little volumizing effect, along with DHT-blocking shampoo.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it seems that the Lipogaine makes very good products. Will keep posted further...</li>
    <li> Works well for me. I am close to 50 with some thinning on top. I have used this product for well over a year. For me, it has grown some hair, but most importantly it seems to have significantly halted or slowed the progress of my male pattern balding. For you new users, please remember a couple of things. As with any product containing minoxidil, you will have some shedding at first. Just continue to use it and things will stabilize. If you start it, please consider continuing it for at least 4 months (unless of course you are having any reactions or other adverse effects; I did not) before arriving at any conclusions about its effectiveness. I now use it once a day and I also use over the counter Nizoral shampoo, which contains 1% ketoconazole, an anti fungal that helps in stopping hair loss. Good luck to you in your hair loss battles!</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for about two years.I had tried everything else with little success.lipogaine is inexpensive and the only product that will give you the results you&#x27;re looking for.Thank you to Lipogaine!!!</li>
    <li> This has worked very well for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t the holy grail, but then what is? The benefits for me have been stronger hair, and less loss while using. Luckily, it works for the front where I&#x27;m receding, to the crown. Actual *regrowth* where barren isn&#x27;t evident, but science has already promised that we&#x27;re within the next 5(00) years we&#x27;ll have a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every now and then when I let my order lapse, there is a definite difference in the thickness of my follicles and hair loss at a more rapid rate (than while using) resumes.</li>
    <li> Had tried both the brand name Rogaine and generic Kirkland Minoxidil with fairly good results in slowing down my hair loss. However, the regrowth was minimal and I was still loosing hair in the shower. Decided to give Lipogaine for Men after seeing different message boards recommending it. Hands down the best minoxidil I have tried. I don&#x27;t know the exact science behind how the extra &amp;#34;goodies&amp;#34; in the formula help but I know that I have scene significant regrowth, an almost complete stop to hairs lost in the shower, and my hair looking better than it ever has. Will definitely continue to use Lipogaine for Men alongside with the Big 3 Shampoo, it&#x27;s the best combination out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and if you are looking for a product that will not only stop your hair loss but will actually regrow it then this is your only option. I am 47 years old and have been steadily loosing my hair for 10 years now and this product absolutely made a noticeable difference in my hair volume and quality and it absolutely has stopped my hair from further loss. One final point it does all of this with no scalp irritation at all. Must use the shampoo it is also a quality product.</li>
    <li> I first started using lipogaine to combat the loss of hair on the crown of my head. I&#x27;m six months in and I can see a remarkable improvement to the area. Nothing miraculous mind you but I&#x27;ve definitely regrown and maintained a healthy amount of hairs. Also, lipogaine dries very quickly, I put it on a half hour before going to bed at night and it&#x27;s dry by the time I hop into bed. When you combine that with the affordability of the product (Seriously Rogaine you&#x27;re overpriced) it makes Lipogaine a winner in my book. If I have to list a slight drawback its that it can cause your head to itch, but I experienced this in my first couple months but not so much nowadays. If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable product to help regrow your hair then I highly recommend Lipogaine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third month of Lipogaine and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. If you&#x27;re like me and found this product as you&#x27;re desperate to find a solution, feeling like your starting-to-bald head has no end and like it&#x27;s all downhill from here, relax. Calm down. You got to the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I found was that minoxidil works. I don&#x27;t care how or why, it works. The second important thing I found was that using minoxidil wasn&#x27;t enough, there has to be some sort of DHT blocking on your part so the new hairs don&#x27;t get \\&quot;attacked\\&quot; and can grow strong and easy. Propecia wasn&#x27;t an option for me, cause I don&#x27;t even want to risk the sexual side effects, and most other solutions are pricey or just seem shady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where Lipogaine comes in. It blocks DHT, it has minoxidil, it even has azelaic acid which suppossedly enhances the minoxidil intake of your scalp. I was as sceptical as the next guy but I KNEW I had to fight my hair loss or forever regret my lack of action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first my hair kept falling, it didn&#x27;t stop that, it even increases shedding in some people. But after a month or so, it stopped. Before I used to dislike showering cause of all the hairs I saw falling off of my head. Now, my hair loss while showering is MINIMAL next to NONE. I literally have showers where I don&#x27;t lose any single hair, compared to before where I lost like 20 minimum. Also, my hair looks stronger, thicker and more full of life now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I began balding I didn&#x27;t get a hair cut for like 8 months cause I didn&#x27;t want anyone to notice. My widow peaks were excruciating to watch for me. Now I have my hair short :) I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it and, *gasp* even I LIKE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I see is the price. But the stuff&#x27;s worth it. You can give up one weekend going out or the ocassional fancy meal in order to keep your hair where it belongs :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, I am not a fake reviewer, I&#x27;m not sure it shows but you can seeI&#x27;ve reviewed things way before this. Way before I even knew I&#x27;d start losing my hair and would need a product to compensate for my not so ideal genetics lmfao.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all brothers, best of lucks on your hair loss battles. We shall forever keep at it and forever win :D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KUDOS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys as of a while ago, Lipogaine no longer contains Azelaic Acid. I must say the product still works but it doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as it used to. I still think it&#x27;s the best minoxidil available but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s as effective blocking DHT as it once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote a letter to Lipogaine urging them to return the azelaic acid to Lipogaine&#x27;s formula. It&#x27;d be awesome if you guys could do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to clear everything up, my original review STILL stands true to me. I still think Lipogaine is the best minoxidil you can get and very much worth it, but it is important to let them know they can&#x27;t just change the formula without having their costumers asking about it or reacting in some way or form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got this :) laters!</li>
    <li> I decided to give a try to hair loss products after doing my research. I don&#x27;t have big expectations but I was told that trying won&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;ve been loosing my hair since my 20&#x27;s and it I stopped hair loss around 25.  Now I&#x27;m 28. I&#x27;ve been shaving my hair and I am fine with being bold. I wish I could use all natural products but this is the combination I will be using including these product: Neogenic Hair Loss Treatment, Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, Alma Hair oil, and Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been only few days so I can&#x27;t say anything besides that: My scalp feel much better, shedding of dead skin during shower stopped. No flaking. I will be reporting and adding pictures every month to see if there will be any significant difference visible.</li>
    <li> Product actually does me better then any other product. I&#x27;m at a high stage of baldness and over the months has reduce the progression.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, you really see results after a couple months, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For all you guys out there I was using remox 4 with the best results you could not believe it contained minoxidil retin a progesterone and azelic acid unfortunately the Dr who invented and prescribed it passed away and lost my source so I bought some lipogaine retin a cream from Canada pharmacy and azelic acid cream and add both lotions to a bottle of lipogaine inf about half of a tea spoon of each in a shot glass take 6 ml of lipogaine and mix it in the shot glass mix until it all liquids then used the dropper to sucks it up and add to the lipogaine and mix thoroughly retin a makes the it so the minoxidil gets much more penatration and azelic acid is a potent dht inhibitor sounds like a lot of work but I promise u its worth it .25 MG tube or retin a</li>
    <li> Let me start this off by stating that I recognize my desire for something to work may or may not skew my overall view of just how much it did work (if at all)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after having used Lipogaine (in conjunction with Biotin infused shampoo/conditioner and a daily dose of 10,000mg of Biotin) for about 4-5 months now, I feel like I genuinely am seeing a result. Not an instant full thick head of hair, but more than the increasingly disappointing amount I had previous. I started using Lipogaine with a completely buzz-cut head (the buzzcut pushed me, seeing so much scalp) and within finishing the first bottole, I noticed small, shorter hairs among the regular length hairs, particularly in areas that were worse off than the rest. Overall, so far, it&#x27;s not a miracle drug. I still have thin hair, and scalp can still be seen with enough light. BUT, the amount of scalp has definitely reduced and my hairline seems to have ceased it&#x27;s recession. Given a full year of use and beyond, I imagine this product may help in retaining hair on my head at least until I hit my 30&#x27;s. Hopefully beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few notes:&lt;br /&gt;- Product dries in the hair, and acts as a weak hair spray if you have long enough hair...helps in the instance of styling your hair without using product that would make your scalp more visible.&lt;br /&gt;- Longer hair will make it harder to spread the product&#x27;s recommended value to the areas you&#x27;d like, so keep it short unless you want to be methodical.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s $25 dollars, and lasts a month. Far cheaper than the competition, and thus far? Seems to actually work.&lt;br /&gt;- Be patient, nothing will be instantaneous. Like keeping in shape, your body needs proper diet in addition to proper exercise. Add biotin pills to your breakfast or dinner, attacking a problem from multiple angles always helps to ensure more success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and I hope other people&#x27;s hair reacts as well or better to this product!</li>
    <li> I apply this product only to my hair line with a soft and small brush and after 2 months of usage I started seeing noticeable growth. It&#x27;s not greasy but I noticed that if I don&#x27;t brush it or rub it in, it get a bit hard and flaky.</li>
    <li> So It has been a little over a year since I started using Lipogaine. This is my one and only brand of minoxidil, and I want to share my honest experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first start off by saying, if you&#x27;re beginning to notice that you&#x27;re losing your hair, you need to start some hair loss regimen ASAP! Time is the enemy of healthy hair, and the loss won&#x27;t stop on its own. With that being said, Minoxidil--the active ingredient in Lipogaine-- is the most popular hair loss treatment on the market. Minoxidil acts as a vasodilator, which means that it increases the blood flow to the tissue in the scalp. This increase of blood flow helps to keep dying hair follicles alive and healthy for longer than they would be on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do any search for minoxidil on Amazon, you&#x27;ll see tons of different brands. Expensive, and inexpensive. The reason I went for Lipogaine initially is that the formula is a combination of several different ingredients. And it is well-known in the hair loss community that using minoxidil in combination with other supplements and treatments is much more effective than minoxidil alone. So Lipogaine&#x27;s addition of saw palmetto, biotin and fatty acids all work in conjunction with minoxidil to make it more effective than the generic minox-only brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the year that I have been using Lipogaine, I&#x27;ve managed to keep my hairline where it is, and the loss has slowed considerably. Not to mention, I&#x27;ve only been using this once a day, instead of the recommended twice per day, which speaks to how effective this stuff actually is. Lipogaine isn&#x27;t the cheapest brand of minoxidil on the market, but I truly believe it has the best combination of ingredients of any brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a side note to any newcomers to the hair loss game, combining Lipogaine with oral supplements such as biotin, gelatin, silica or even Propecia, will help it work its magic even better. Also, I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that it does give me a very flaky scalp. Be sure to use a dandruff shampoo and a very moisturizing conditioner, and you&#x27;ll be fine. Good luck!a very flaky scalp. Be sure to use a dandruff shampoo and a very moisturizing conditioner, and you&#x27;ll be fine. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for my thinning area for a little over a year now.  Throughout several bouts of shedding I have maintained, and even regrown some of my hair.  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars, because I don&#x27;t think anything is the perfect fix for thinning hair, but this product has helped keep my hair from getting thinner.  It&#x27;s easy to use and not greasy at all, it actually makes my hair feel thicker when I have it on.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for nearly 9 months and can positively say it is effective.  I began using as part of something of a mid-life tuneup at age 38..working out, eating better, and improving things like clothing choices and one of the big ones:  my hair.  It had been thinning for a while and I had 2 choices.  Let it continue to fall out and go with the close-cut, shaved head that many guys my age go to...or take a hair product and grow my hair out.  I decided the latter which let me to research hair products on Amazon.com.  Lipogaine was the #1 seller on Amazon.com and had a lot of positive reviews, so I decided to try it.  Nine months, my hair is looking less thin, more full (not perfect), but enough for me to grow it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take once in the morning after towel drying my hair post-shower, then again at night.  I use the same comb to push aside the balding area and apply the dose.  It is pretty straight forward.  I would recommend taking pictures before you start, and every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I recommend using this with a total life style change..workout, lose weight, eat to live and use products like Lipogaine to bring your hair back and some confidence along with it.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from hair loss and thinning since my mid 20&#x27;s. Mpb runs in my family. This product is a miracle. I used it once everyday for the last three years and have almost completely reversed my hair loss. I will purchase indefinitely! Thank you Lipogaine!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Very Good Product. Packed with very powerful ingredients. no side effects and works fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a year ago.  I am an actor and I was frustrated with how thin my hair was looking on camera and in photos.  Within a couple of months I noticed an obvious difference in the thickness of my hair; it was much improved.  When I look back on footage of me from before using this product, the difference is striking.  I also was worried about potential side-effects but I experienced none.  I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Overall a great product, with a truly simple and condensed approach at hair regrowth. Worked as advertised for me, nothing less, nothing more.</li>
    <li> Top top minoxidil, no other minoxidil comes close .....its carrier helps penetrate the skin and reach the follicle. But guys look it works for my because I am persistent with it. If you use it, blood and nutrients get to the follicle, if I don&#x27;t use it then no nutrients get to it.... simple. Ive used it for 6 months now and I see great improvements in hair density</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for almost a year and I can definitely say that it has eliminated my hair loss and possibly contributed to some regrowth.</li>
    <li> I use Lipogaine as part of my big 3 daily routine (Minoxidil, Propecia, Keto Shampoo) for preventing hair loss. I began losing hair in my early twenties (initial receding hairline and thinning at the top) and had done extensive research on the products available to either help regrow or at least stem the tide of loss. Lipogaine was highly rated and included ingredients which supposedly enhanced the formula. Suffice to say, I decided to give it a try. It has been nearly two years since I&#x27;ve been on the product and I can say with confidence that my thinning scalp has since stop shedding and has in fact regrown and thickened some and my hairline has stopped receding. All in all, I will continue to purchase this formula for the foreseeable future (as evidenced in my purchase history).</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a year.  My dermatologist says it&#x27;s clearly growing some small hairs back, but I feel like I am still losing hair. I am current taking finasteride and using ketoconazole shampoos, and it seems like my hair loss is slowing down. This causes some itching. The good thing about lipogaine is that it is easy to apply and dries very quickly.</li>
    <li> It works great for me!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing works really good no smell neither its greasy, for some it takes few months to work and for some you will see the results from the first month and top of everything its no.1 if you compare it all the minoxidil. I would recommend this product to everyone, thanks to lipogaine.!!!</li>
    <li> None of these hair treatments or shampoos grow hair for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different hair loss treatments, but this is the only one that has really worked for me. It does exactly what it claims to do: regrow hair! It was delivered within a couple of days after being ordered and the results have been great. I followed the instructions and within a few weeks I was pretty excited to see new hair growth in areas that I never thought I would see hair again! I highly recommend this product to anyone who has tried so many other products but was disappointed in the results!</li>
    <li> I use this at night and Rogaine foam in the morning. I feel like its a good quality minoxidil dropper and has good ingredients for your scalp. I only wish they would bring back the azelaic acid it used to have but it still seems to work well. I didn&#x27;t have the shedding problems some people get when you start using minoxidil. Lipogaine is a bit pricy but I&#x27;m willing to pay more for a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> The results of using this product, while minor so far, seem promising and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 8 months now and it really works. I had hair thinning problems in front and my scalp was so much visible. After using this product for 4 months, I can see minor hair outgrowths and now my scalp is less visible. I am not going to stop using this product. Its amazing.</li>
    <li> Item as described - Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two years now and am very happy with the results so far. I would definitely recommend this product.  The only downfall is that you have to continue to use it for the long hall (never stop) and it takes awhile to see the results. As long as you have patience and your expectations aren&#x27;t unreasonabl it&#x27;s a good buy until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several month.  I have noticed a significant amount of hair growth and thickness</li>
    <li> Firstly let me say Alopecia (hair loss) is a medical condition that has many different types. [...] has some good pics. Male pattern baldness (Androgenetic alopecia) and Female pattern baldness are the only ones for which Minoxidil was tested against and approved for. What I want to say here is like any medical condition you should see a Doctor and get it properly diagnosed before at the very least wasting you money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, my own condition is Diffused Hair Loss. I started noticing it a few years ago on one side of the crown, then the other, and now the top from the forehead back to the vertex. Not bald but thinning and the hair isn&#x27;t growing in. I probably should have addressed the issue sooner but wanted to now before I go completely bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine is one of these new generation of hair loss products which combines DHT blocking with the hair growing element in addition to some vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;This as opposed to you buying separate products (typically Finasteride is used in conjunction w/Minoxidil when treating Male Pattern Baldness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem here is there is only one (1) clinical study showing the effectiveness of Saw palmetto in blocking and/or reducing DHT levels regarding hair loss. That study only had 10 males. Hardly a reasonable sample to draw any scientific conclusions. This might explain why there aren&#x27;t any medical guidelines published on the dosage required to achieve that aim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise w/Azelaic Acid. Only one small study was done to test it&#x27;s effectiveness at blocking/reducing DHT levels regarding hair loss and that was done in the lab on rats. No human clinical study has been done that I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hang in there as I&#x27;m not going to go down the entire ingredient list. The vitamins (like Biotin) are well known for \\&quot;aiding\\&quot; in strong healthy hair but more to the point. When you extract out the DHT blocking claims I just can&#x27;t justify the cost of this product over a generic brand of Minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when there are some that sell 3 or 6 months worth for the same price. And you&#x27;ll need that much time at least to see any if at all improvement in your condition. That&#x27;s just the way Minoxidil works. Also remember once you start using Minoxidil your on it for life or you will lose any hair that&#x27;s grown within several months. The costs can quickly add up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I ordered didn&#x27;t even make it through two weeks. I just ran out and got the generic stuff from the local Pharmacy until my appt comes up w/my Dermatologist. So I can&#x27;t report as to whether or not any hair did grow in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you have one small spot to treat it might last you, but using it twice a day as directed on the amount of real estate I had to cover it was a no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any adverse side effects (itching, bumps, redness, that sort of thing). I&#x27;m not going to whine about it running down my face, back of my neck and such (water always seeks the lowest point,, get it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summing it up folks you will notice a trend with all these products for stopping hair loss and/or regrowing hair. Small 2 ounce bottles whose active ingredient (Minoxidil) takes several months to show any signs of improvement. At $25.00 a bottle x 2 per month that&#x27;s at least $150.00 + tax and shipping to try it for 3 months. If you&#x27;ve experienced side effects with other similar products and need/want to try something different then by all means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Times are hard and my pocket is lean, I need make the maximum effectiveness of any purchase I make these days. Lipogaine needs to come down in price a bit as there isn&#x27;t any worthwhile reason to pay the premium they&#x27;re charging IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 6 months, twice a day. I really wanted to like it. It goes on very easily and dries quickly. It appears to have ingredients that are superior to regular minoxidil. Unfortunately, I have seen no benefit. Actually, my hair looks thinner in the areas I have been using it. Other reviews are very positive, and perhaps my experience is unique. Just want to let people know that with long term use, some of us have seen no results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been lossing hair for the past 6 year.  It hasn&#x27;t cool.  In the first few years I tried an array of different products ranging from shampoos to dietary supplements.  However, none of this worked, and I was still lossing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year and a half ago I decided to do more research and found many people recommending Minoxidil based products.  At that time I went and bought the product with the highest concentration I could find, so I ended up getting a Minoxidil 15% solution.  I applied 1ml of the product once a day and within two months the results where very noticeable.  My hair was significantly thicker and I wasn&#x27;t lossing as much hair, I was applying the product only once a day.  So I continued with this treatment for about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the FDA decided to ban Minoxidil 15% solutions.  At that point I panicked, but at the end I decided to try [[ASIN:B002UD52XA DS Laboratories Spectral DNC Topical Hair Loss Treatement, 60-ml Bottle]].  But within two months my hair was thinning again and I was lossing hair very rapidly.  So again, I went online and found that a lot of people who where using the 15% solution had moved to the 5% solution and the results where similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I decided to Lipogaine for men.  Now, since in this case the Minoxidil concentration is lower I decided to apply it twice a day (in the morning and before going to bed).  I have been using the product for about 5 months now and I feel very encouraged with the results.  You can actually see hair growing thicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using generic Rogaine for years. I switched to this thinking it would be a little bit better, albeit more expensive. I basically started losing all the hair I had gained using plain old Rogaine. I&#x27;ve switched back to Rogaine generic, which is a fraction of the price and now my hair is back to normal.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately i was unable to give this item a long enough trial for a adequate review. After three days of use, morning and night i started to get pressure in chest, jittery and a feeling of heart burn. I tried switching to just once a day and skipping a few days but as soon as i used the product after a few hours i started to not feel right. It would take a good 24 to 48 hours for me to feel right again. I have taken Kirkland brand in the past and don&#x27;t recall these harsh reactions. Not sure if one of the other ingredients that are not agreeing with me. I think i am going to give a generic minox brand a go and see if those side effects follow again. If so, then minox is not for me. Some people get these nasty side effects and others are just fine. I guess u have to try and see.</li>
    <li> in tandem with my shampoo this serum is awesome, I only apply it once a day right before bed but my hair has gotten fuller and thicker and re growth has yielded results every week, I will continue to use this product for many months to come because it works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this and another brand sold by Amazon and they both work equally well except that this one is a bit sticky and gives you the appearance that you are using hair-gel. Other than that it does work well</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I have been using this product for just 30 days so it is hard to tell if it is doing anything yet. Administering it can be a challenge because it is a liquid that can run down the sides of your face and neck. It seems to absorb in the scalp quickly though. The eye dropper is really good for getting the Lipogaine on the scalp as opposed to the hair where it gets flakey and white. In another 30 days I can give a better review. Check back.</li>
    <li> bad product, does not work</li>
    <li> Because of the reviews I decidied to stop using Roagaine and try lipogaine. I use it day and night and I see hair growth, prob not as fast as Rogaine but I kinda lasped some days. If you use it religiously you will see results. Its kinda sticky and it leaves a white drandruff-like residue after about a week of use. Once you shampoo your hair that shouldnt be a problem. My hair also grows and feels normal unlike rogaine where it felt kinda weird..almost alien to me. This one feels like its mine. Would defiinitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh with Rogaine I had to keep it in the fridge to keep the foam. I live in the Caribbean so it gets kinda hot here. If i left it out it&#x27;d spray like a liquid, so the fridge was my best friend. If you got AC then you shouldnt need to put it in the fridge. Aslo I travel in heilcopters alot and you cant take pressurized  containers with you so I had to sneak them on when I was going to work on rigs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this prod for my bf as he was facing alittle of retreating hairline issue. Read lots of review on how wonderful this is, so wanted to give it a try. But after a few use, the product was giving out a very strong alcohol smell! I&#x27;m not sure if thats normal, but he stopped using it completely.</li>
    <li> the bad part, many dandruff&lt;br /&gt;the good part, stopped the fall of my hair and is growing again&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it works, just as Rogaine does, but I always have the itchy head problem and need to give it a better try. It has a bit more residue than Rogaine and it makes the hair stiff unless you are careful to get it only on the scalp not all over the hair.</li>
    <li> Havent seen improvement in my hair grouth and I&#x27;ve been using it for more than two years. I keep using it because it keeps my hair calm and dont need to use other hair products to style them.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for thin hair. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products, but with Lipogaine, I can see the results already since day one . Took 3 months to see my hair back so give it a try ...  Sincerely ,  Carlin</li>
    <li> I think it does work albeit it seems to take quite a bit of time. so far its the best product I h.ave found</li>
    <li> Very good product. I did not get a lot of &#x27;hair regrowth&amp;#34; but it did stop my hair from falling out. I started using this product a few years ago and I am confident that I would be fully bald if it wasn&#x27;t for this.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and started to notice a tiny vertex on the top of my head back in 2009. I&#x27;ve always had a sense of pride in the thickness of my hair and this really scared me. I did my research on google and like everyone else I settled on the product that probably advertised the most and made the most claims. I purchased a half year supply of Provillus. The first three months of my treatment were actually agonizing with my scalp itching to the point where I bled from scratching. I eventually became immune to the irritation but not much had changed and my vertex had grown. I eventually tried Rogaine brand from CVS since the cost was much less. I would rotate between a CVS generic brand and Rogaine but still little was changing on my head. Earlier in 2012 someone suggested Lipogaine on a blog for people losing hair.I have to admit, the product is expensive but it has greater effect than the other three products I used. I would not assert I have my full flock of hair back but it has made my hair fuller and has prevented further hair loss. With the thicker hair I can comb to cover the vertex portion of my head. I will continue to buy this product until someone finds a cure or until my head just becomes bald by the natural process of aging. Having been a user of the big name brands, I wish I had found this product back in 2009.</li>
    <li> I was having some skin irritation with Rogaine, so I tried this.  Caused even more irritation than the Rogaine.  If you are prone to irritation, don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good, especially in the beginning. Been using for a couple months and this is much better than the full Nioxin treatment system 2 (shampoo, conditioner, scalp therapy, foam) which I used prior. The results seem to have plateued a bit however but still works good and will continue to use for frontal receding hairline</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for the last seven months and I have seen impressive results. My hair was thinning noticeably, especially around the hairline. I am in my forties and have taken pride in having full thick hair. Before considering transplants, I tried Lipogaine. All I can say is I went from seeing more scalp than hair in certain places to now seeing it in reverse. I no longer feel insecure about my hair, and see no need to see a hair transplant doctor. I will keep on using Lipogaine as long as I care about my hairline.</li>
    <li> I waited a *long* time to review this product and hesitated to write anything at all.  I used this product as advertised for three months and it just did not work for me.  It was, in fact, extremely unpleasant to use and I finished my usage with less hair than I started with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea with this product is that the active ingredient dilates the hair follicles, causing some initial hair loss, but eventually causing thicker hair to grow back in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I only experienced the first half of this cycle (hair loss), with not even the slightest hint of new hair growth after three months.  My hairloss is near the front of my hairline, which might have had something to do with this.  Many of these hair regrowth products tend to work better on the crown than the front of the hairline.  I knew this before using the product, I just figured it was worth a shot.  Unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am giving this product three stars because I have faith that it might work for some people.  I cannot recommend this product for front-hairline hairloss, but if you are losing hair on the crown of your head, it would probably work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I must mention about this product is that it&#x27;s very unpleasant to use.  The ingredients in it irritated my scalp and made it itch incessantly for the first few weeks.  The itching was so bad I almost stopped using it during the first bottle, but managed to get through it.  It also weighs your hair down, making it look greasy and wet - which is the exact opposite of what you want if you have thinning hair.  Let me be clear, I hated using this stuff, but if you find you get results from it, it could be worth it for you.</li>
