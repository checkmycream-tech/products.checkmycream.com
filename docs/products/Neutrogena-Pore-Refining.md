      <li>This product is effective and well priced.  </li>
      <li>product impressed me so much</li>

      <li>love this product , all of there product are good</li>
      <li>I love love love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>Love the way it leaves my skin, smooth and clean for me this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>My cheeks are now incredibly oily with increasingly large pores.</li>
      <li>So far I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel nice, cleans and minimizes my pores and makes me skin feel much more refreshed.</li>
      <li>The texture is smoother, the pores are nearly invisible and it&#x27;s excellent at getting off makeup.  </li>
      <li>Also, the exfoliating beads are very fine, so it&#x27;s not a scrub.</li>
      <li>Read plenty of good reviews and have to say they are true.</li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena and use a lot of their products</li>
      <li>It is an ok choice - there isn&#x27;t any burning with this product, but I would buy it again.  </li>
      <li>thankfully i was able to find it here.  </li>
      <li>I think I like it better than the Neutrogena.</li>
      <li>Better than almost anything else I have used.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This has always been my favorite face cleaner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if I keep using it, they will eventually fade away until they aren&#x27;t noticeable without makeup.</li>
      <li>LOVE this.</li>
      <li>Since this one is made by Neutrogena, I felt confident that it would do the job.</li>
      <li>It works ok.</li>
      <li>Many a department store cleansers can cost 3-4X as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product &amp; I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>I really love this cleanser and the price.  </li>
      <li>Just makes sure to avoid your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>then on top of it use my AHA product.  </li>
      <li>Most of them don&#x27;t work for me and a majority of them make my face break out.</li>
      <li>I am pleased</li>
      <li>Glycolic Acid is also found in many products sold to you by your Esthetician and it is known for stimulating collagen and elastin.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff, and i rather order on amazon then go to walomart</li>
      <li>My skin has never been happier :-)</li>
      <li>Three just to be safe.</li>
      <li>so i want to be able to get that peel like result without the peel</li>
      <li>After I used it and rinsed my face, as soon as I opened my eyes they burned like I had just been rubbing peppers on them, so I rinsed, rinsed, rinsed some more until the burning stopped.</li>
      <li>So if I use it in the morning, it makes my face feel good for the entire morning, but by afternoon, it doesn&#x27;t feel so great anymore.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the cleanser was causing the breakout, so I kept using it.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and and am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>and so far so good!</li>
      <li>But for me, a pleasant scent and positive, noticeable, immediate results help motivate me to use the product.</li>
      <li>It is the single best skin care product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a big tube for very very good price.</li>
      <li>On the other hand the results are wonderful.</li>
      <li>so I feel so strongly about this that I will write it again.    </li>
      <li>Fine product</li>
      <li>After I wash my face it has a glow that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was pregnant!</li>
      <li>I had a huge pimple on my cheek at the time but after using Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining cleanser, the pimple started to decrease in size and by the end of the trip (4 days), it disappeared.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel real grainy, which I liked.</li>
      <li>it leaves my skin smooth and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>No wonder it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>Women will enjoy this product as it may prevent hormonal</li>
      <li>You might as well wash your face with a cheap bar of ivory soap.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend a product that has the potential to cause the problems I experienced.</li>
      <li>The product itself was very good, just after the first two days using it i saw a difference in my skin appearance, pores were smaller, skin softer!</li>
      <li>i like the way it scrubs my face, keeping pores clean and my face flake free.  </li>
      <li>I use this every day and it has significantly reduced my pore sizes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, has worked amazingly on my troubled skin. I have never found a facial cleanser that actually kept my acne to a bare minimum as this product does. I had literally tried everything, and very expensive products at that with minimal to no success. I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results that I have obtained with this product.</li>
    <li> Has helped my complexion a lot!</li>
    <li> Overall, I just did not like this cleanser. Here&#x27;s why:    1) When I use a facial cleanser, I expect my face to feel refreshed and to glow. With this cleanser, my face just felt the same and looked sort of blah.  2) I don&#x27;t care for the scent. It&#x27;s somewhat soapy and sharp.  3) I was disappointed in the exfoliating aspect - this feels more like a cream cleanser. The microbeads are indeed there, but they don&#x27;t seem to do much. Maybe they do and I just can&#x27;t see it.  4) I haven&#x27;t noticed a visible improvement in my skin. My pores are the same size and my skin does NOT look refined. Granted, I don&#x27;t use it every day so maybe that&#x27;s why. Or maybe it has to do with #3.    I realize that successful results are partly dependent on daily use. But for me, a pleasant scent and positive, noticeable, immediate results help motivate me to use the product. This product, unfortunately, does not motivate me.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser - it work great.  My skin feels smoother after using it, and I&#x27;ve noticed fewer black heads and blemishes. I also find that I need to use products that are specifically for exfoliating less often. I find that using this cleanser in the mornign really helps wake me up, too - the microscrubber beads or whatever they call them feel great.</li>
    <li> Product just as described.</li>
    <li> I am also a skeptic when it comes to facial cleansers. Most of them don&#x27;t work for me and a majority of them make my face break out. I purchased a bottle of this because it was affordable and I had to do something. The summer heat has really wreaked havoc on my skin. So far I am very happy with my purchase. After I wash my face it has a glow that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was pregnant! You can feel it working shortly after you rinse it off; your face starts to feel tighter.     The price is affordable and it works great. I recommend at least giving it a try. I&#x27;m hooked and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this cleanser when it first came out and immediately noticed that it is different. After using the first bottle up I have never let my self run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it claims, period. I just don&#x27;t get break outs. It minimizes the look of enlarged pores and it prevents clogged pores from turning into zits because it has two chemicals to sweep out the gunk. My skin feels clean without feeling tight or squeeky. I have normal skin and it doesn&#x27;t over dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is something between soapy and creamy with tiny smooth grains in it. It took a little getting used to because it doesn&#x27;t really foam up, maybe like ten percent. Don&#x27;t let that confuse you though, most cleansers ADD a chemical who&#x27;s sole purpose is to foam, because the customer expects it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, It has more of a clinical odor than a perfumed scent, but that makes sense since it&#x27;s technically medicated product to resolve acne. I typically don&#x27;t want anything extra in products I put on my face anyway, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned I&#x27;m glad they don&#x27;t heavily perfume to cover the medicinal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple people mentioned stinging in the eyes: The packaging does indicate you should not get it in your eyes. This product contains Alpha Hydroxy Acid - any acid would hurt in the eyes! The alpha hydroxy acid is a heavy duty hitter, that&#x27;s what you are paying for! If I have eyeliner and mascara on, then I use the Neutrogena eye makeup remover first, then wash my face as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product so much I will probably use it forever. It is a performance product, it has just what you need to clean out your pores. It&#x27;s a good daily cleanser that will have people complementing your skin in no time flat.</li>
    <li> Really great &amp; reasonbley priced scrub, works well on acne, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency towards foliculitis and this cleanser is the only one I&#x27;ve found that clears it up really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite face cleaner.  Its been harder and harder to find.  The only problem I have is the price.  Too expensive so I may have to change to another product.</li>
    <li> With both AHAs and BHAs, it&#x27;s a great value for the money.  I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for years and it has served me well.  Skin is clean and smooth with minimal breakouts.  It does dry you out a bit, but it&#x27;s nothing that a 30-second application of facial moisturizer can&#x27;t take care of.  I recommend it, but it&#x27;s getting harder to find, it seems.  I hope that Neutrogena has not discontinued it completely.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining Cleanser is actually a wonderful 1 Step Cleanse/Exfoliate/Refine product that is perfect for traveling. Why take three products when one will work very well. In fact, my husband brought this product home when I asked him to buy me a similar product and I&#x27;m even more impressed with the Alpha and Beta Hydroxy Formula than any of the formulas with Benzoyl Peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m only testing this product at home, studies have shown that a combination of glycolic and salicylic acid is more effective than benzoyl peroxide. I read about it after I tried this product so my short time of personal experience proved the study was quite correct. Glycolic Acid is also found in many products sold to you by your Esthetician and it is known for stimulating collagen and elastin. It will even help to reduce acne scars and will keep dead skin cells from building up inside the hair follicles. Glycolic will also help the skin not to grow over the pores and so it prevents ingrown hairs. This product will be especially enjoyed by men who shave. Women will enjoy this product as it may prevent hormonal breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains \\&quot;Glycolic Acid\\&quot; which seems to prevent problems and is derived from fruit, whereas Benzoyl Peroxide has to fix the problems caused by a lack of exfoliation. So, using a product with Glycolic Acid seems to keep my skin exfoliated. While there are gentle microbeads, you don&#x27;t really feel them and this is much more like a facial gel wash than an abrasive cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product impressed me so much I even sent a tube to a friend in the mail. Not something I&#x27;d normally do unless I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For even better results, try a cream with Glycolic Acid or look for Vital Sciences Glycolic Liquid Exfoliator or Skin Eternal DMAE Serum. There are also quite a few Glycolic moisturizers for face and body from Peter Thomas Roth and Reviva. I also love the Derma E Glycolic Facial Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a product with Glycolic Acid and one of the Derma E skin care creams or the Kiss My Face Under Age Organic Moisturizer, you should notice a much clearer complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other essentials include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Tea Tree and E oil&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face Acne Gel&lt;br /&gt;Aroma Land Problem Skin Blend - Essential oil&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Alpha Lipoderm with Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Age-Defying Day Creme&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Clear Skin 2&lt;br /&gt;D&#x27;Arcy Drying Lotion&lt;br /&gt;Zia Sulphur Mask&lt;br /&gt;Zia Papaya Peel&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Microdermabrasion Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Joey Pure Pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Reviewcid and one of the Derma E skin care creams or the Kiss My Face Under Age Organic Moisturizer, you should notice a much clearer complexion.    Other essentials include:     Derma E Tea Tree and E oil  Kiss My Face Acne Gel  Aroma Land Problem Skin Blend - Essential oil  Derma E Alpha Lipoderm with Green Tea  Derma E Age-Defying Day Creme  Derma E Clear Skin 2  D&#x27;Arcy Drying Lotion  Zia Sulphur Mask  Zia Papaya Peel  Derma E Microdermabrasion Scrub  Joey Pure Pores    ~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Love the way it leaves my skin, smooth and clean for me this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried. Also purchased &amp;#34;Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub&amp;#34;  didn&#x27;t like the feeling it left on my skin.  But this one is great and for me much better than any I have tried.</li>
    <li> Two minutes after rinsing the product off my face was extremely dry and ASHY (or flakey). You might as well wash your face with a cheap bar of ivory soap. My typical skin is average, not dry or oily except in extremely hot or cold weather.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get this Amazon but, same product and it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this after reading some horror stories about one of the multi-step skin products (ordering system probs) advertised on infomercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works as well or better than other products promise w/o tying you into long-term commitments for things you don&#x27;t want or need w/ a solid brand name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is not a harsh or abrasive scrub, feels and smells super and the amount is generous enough, as well, for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5*&#x27;s</li>
    <li> As a young adult, I have acne-prone skin with some enlarged pores around around my nose. I bought this hoping it would help clear me up, when, in fact, it did quite the opposite. When I first squeezed some into my hand I noticed that it had a very chemically odor. After I used it and rinsed my face, as soon as I opened my eyes they burned like I had just been rubbing peppers on them, so I rinsed, rinsed, rinsed some more until the burning stopped. My face felt clean, but smelled like chemicals, and in the morning I woke up with a few new zits. I wasn&#x27;t sure the cleanser was causing the breakout, so I kept using it. I slowly developed terrible acne and had to stop using it. About a week after I did, I was back to normal. I gave this cleanser to my sister to try and she had very good results, but stopped using it because she was concerned about the chemical odor. I would not recommend a product that has the potential to cause the problems I experienced.</li>
    <li> It does a good job but I don&#x27;t like the beads. I use it with the toner and like the way it has softened my skin and reduced blackheads on the nose. I don&#x27;t think the beads are necessary because the acid will exfoliate along with a washcloth.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed much of a difference, but my pores are really horrible… I&#x27;m about halfway through the bottle now. Works well with my Clarisonic or as a standalone cleanser</li>
    <li> I had used this product in the past after reading good reviews of it, and then had trouble finding it for awhile.  I recently saw a few tubes in a few stores, and hoarded them before I really saw the effect.  The product seems to exfoliate without being excessively harsh, but I haven&#x27;t noticed my pores looking any smaller.  I have read that nothing can actually make the pores smaller.  The one thing I really dislike about the product, and other reviewers have mentioned it, too, is that it really burns the eyes if it gets in them.  And it seems to be impossible for me to rinse it off my face without getting it in my eyes, even when I use a wash cloth to remove it.  I regret having bought so many tubes of it now--these will last me a long time.  I have recently also started to use a prescription retin-A, and I can&#x27;t use the cleanser along with the retin-A, because I am getting some dry patches, especially around my nose and mouth.  Does anyone know why it stings the eyes so much?</li>
    <li> I was hoping that, as the product says, daily use would reduce the appearance of pores.  It takes a little bit more for me, and I don&#x27;t have enormous pores.  I also use a pore-reducing mask about once a week, and this product works better with that extra weekly boost.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new facial cleanser and I like Neutrogena Visibly Even cleanser and can never find it at my local store.  I decided to try this cleanser as I usually like Neutrogena products. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with breakouts, but I do have large pores so I thought this would be great. I did not care for the smell, it is terrible.  The product burns your eyes a good deal if you get some in them as well.  After about two weeks of using this cleanser my chin is covered in zits, the worst breakout I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m guessing that the cleanser closes up your pores and the oils can not escape, or at least that is what it seemed to do to me. I will not use this cleanser again.</li>
    <li> Hmmm - I wrote this review a few days ago and it was pulled down so I feel so strongly about this that I will write it again.    I used this product and from the moment it touched my skin it started to burn, and burn bad so of course I immediatly washed it off my face.  By the next morning, my face was very red, lightly (but obviously) swollen and my skin was tight and in pain.  Today as I write this my face is still red, irritated and swollen, but not as bad and this three days later.  My skin is flaking off.    I did not have an allergic reaction to this product, the problem was the various acids in the product burned my skin.  Its not that these acids are not safe, but do an internet search on them and all of the sites tell you to do a skin test before using prodects like this.  Neutrogema fails to put any sugnifigant warning or indication that there is a chance that this product will not be good for your skin.    Sorry so long everyone.  This is probably a great product for some, just be careful before you throw it on your face.</li>
    <li> I use to never break out, maybe a pimple on my face was the worst. Usaully went away in a day or two. Then I started working where I was stressed and couldn&#x27;t helped but break out, horribly. Started on my forehead, then it settled to breaking out on my chin. I tried many different brands. Finally I found this, I started using it in November and it&#x27;s now March, my face is saved!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
    <li> My sister told me about this product.  After trying it for just a few days, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  Already I can see a smoother texture with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply this to wet skin and rub it in.  It has a grainy feel as you are rubbing it.  Then it is rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does warn that you will be more sensitive to the sun.  Since I always try to wear sunscreen anyway, that doesn&#x27;t worry me too much.</li>
    <li> I really like this Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser! I used to use Proactive for years! Which I do love the Proactive rash cleanser, But having to pay $50 for the bigger bottle was starting to hurt my wallet! I don&#x27;t get acne that much, but I do have very large pores and very, very oily skin! This cleanser really has made my pores smaller, not over night, it takes maybe a month or little less.. makes my face feel really clean, I noticed since my pores are a little smaller, my make up looks even better!! I can now cover them up, without it looking like I had filled them in!! LOL..I have sensetive skin, &amp; dermatitis, and this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, so I would think this would be good for people with sensetive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser while on a trip to Boston after realizing that I had forgot to bring the one that I usually use at home. I had a huge pimple on my cheek at the time but after using Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining cleanser, the pimple started to decrease in size and by the end of the trip (4 days), it disappeared. My skin also felt smooth and clean without being dry. Ever since, I have used this cleanser every day and had not one single breakout and my skin&#x27;s texture has continually felt clean and smooth.    Although the acne scars that I had did not completely disappear, I&#x27;ve notice remarkable improvement. The cleanser did make them a lot lighter. I&#x27;m sure if I keep using it, they will eventually fade away until they aren&#x27;t noticeable without makeup. So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 months.    Helped also with the blackheads on my nose. They are virtually gone.    I haven&#x27;t really notice much change to the size of my pores but I guess they depend on how big the pores were to begin with.    Be careful around the eye area. If it gets into your eyes, it will sting and can be quite painful.    Overall, I very, very happy with this product and will continue to purchase it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I have one word:  WOW!  I used this the second I bought it and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results I got.  My pores were most certainly less visible, my skin looked brighter and more even, and it felt very smooth and clean to the touch.  I am thoroughly impressed.  Well worth the money!  I very highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple years. It exfoliates without drying out the skin. One tube lasts a long time, too. It is far less expensive than department store brands and just as good.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely hands down, the best product I have found in a long time.  It does not breakout my face,  it leaves my skin smooth and hydrated.  My face glows now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and it&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;My schedule has been extremely busy lately and being able to order my cleanser and have it delivered was a huge time saver. It arrived quickly and and am very satisfied. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat large pores, so I was really hoping this would help. I use it once a day and it immediately shrinks and clears them out considerably, though they get bad again the next day. Overall though, I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my complexion, so I&#x27;d highly recommend this even though it&#x27;s not magic.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the stuff..she said it works great!! She said she was glad she found it! She would but it again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any true results from this. In addition, it really, really stings my eyes. My husband tried it as well and said the same.</li>
    <li> It cleans my skin without overly drying.  A good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every other day for 2 weeks now, and I have noticed my pores are smaller and this product has exfoliated and cleansed my skin very nicely. I am in my late 50&#x27;s and I have some pimples popping up after using this product so I know it is cleaning out my pores. I highly recommend, you only need to use a tiny bit, on a loofah face sponge, and then I rinse with warm water, or I take my loofah sponge right in the shower with me..!! This tube will last a very long time.!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, so I like cleansers to remove all oiliness: this one doesn&#x27;t do it. The microbeads don&#x27;t seem to do much exfoliating, even with daily use. My pores look the same, although I don&#x27;t believe in miracles and I didn&#x27;t expect this cleanser to change them in any way. I won&#x27;t buy this cleanser again.</li>
    <li> I just received this product a little over 2 weeks ago, used it for 3 days straight and found that it did the job great, my pores were much less noticeable and my skin was clearer, after the 3rd day I noticed that it was starting to get a little irritating so I started using it every other day, about the 7th day of using it my forehead showed 2 pimples, and I never have had pimples or acne, I&#x27;ve just always had blackheads. I run a lot and have noticed if I go running on a day I use it my face starts to burn about halfway through my run (it does say on the back that a lot of direct sunlight can make this product more likey to burn and to apply sunscreen if need be) therefore I can only use it about twice a week and it does do its job, but you absolutely need to test it out at first, I just found out the hard way. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin this might be the jackpot, just not in my case.</li>
    <li> Made me break out like crazy...in places I never used to get zits. I have pimples on my upper lip, cheeks, underside of nose. Horrible. Waste of money. Cheaper in stores, but still not worth it. This has never happened to me before. I have loved all other Neutrogena products, but this one just doesn&#x27;t work. Now I have to find another cleanser that can get rid of the zits this gave me. zero stars.</li>
    <li> It says it is for making your pores smaller, and though that is why I bought it, (I have HUGE pores), I noticed a minimal change in pore size, but, it cleared up my face so well. I don&#x27;t think I had a break out the whole time I used it. My sister did comment saying that my pores looked smaller so I guess that worked too. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, but I think there is some mistake about the price.  59.99?  Please set the price right.</li>
    <li> This product arrived very nicely: individually shrink-wrapped and sealed so kudos to the company that shipped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it seems okay so far.  You can barely feel--if at all--any of the microbeads (unlike the St. Ives exfoliating cleanser where you really feel them).</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff!! I took it for granted just how much it was working and helping my skin. I ran out and didn&#x27;t use it for about 2 weeks and I started to break out, my face was oily, I had horrible blackheads and just felt gross. I started using this again and my face is back to clear and glowing! I definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I am 42 and noticed that the pores on my face were looking larger and the texture of my skin was not what it used to be.  I&#x27;ve been using this product, with the matching Toner for 2 weeks and YIPPEE my skin looks great!!!  The texture is smoother, the pores are nearly invisible and it&#x27;s excellent at getting off makeup.  No need to  spend $40-$70 on an expensive cleansing system.  This cleanser and toner do a very good job for less than $20.  One caution is to not get it in your eyes - it&#x27;ll sting like heck.  I follow up these 2 products at night with Lancome Genifique Aging Serum and Lancome High Resolution moisturizer.  My skin has never been happier :-)</li>
    <li> The only defoliator I can use daily without drying out or irritating my skin. I use this every day and my pores are significantly smaller, skin smoother and brighter. LOVE this.</li>
    <li> Excellent  article. It arrived at time</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin so it&#x27;s not recommended that i get peels or anything that drastic but i am over 40 so i want to be able to get that peel like result without the peel so i use this.  I have an AHA product that i use every other day but when i want to really get a fresh look, i wash my face with this (no more than once a week) then on top of it use my AHA product.  It&#x27;s gentle but effective - i really like this product!</li>
    <li> It works ok. I still have acne problem and some enlarged pore due to acne (luckily no acne scar yet). This thing seem to be able to smooth your pore and make them a lot less visible. The only complaint I have is that the effect only seems to last for a few hours, and there is no way anyone can use this more than once a day. So if I use it in the morning, it makes my face feel good for the entire morning, but by afternoon, it doesn&#x27;t feel so great anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this product. good price too!</li>
    <li> Alpha Hydroxy cleansers and moisturizers are becoming more difficult to find in retail stores.  Since this one is made by Neutrogena, I felt confident that it would do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought Neutrogena Pore Refining at the recommendation of a friend who often wears grease paint as part of his show.He said it was excellent!So,While,I grow weary of the ever increasing stash of products that dont work,I tried it.One week now,and WOW!!!!Huge difference! Not a heavy overpowering smell,and the friction beads didnt feel like ground glass!Great product! Ill be buying more when this runs out.Got my mid 80&#x27;0 mum using it!!!!:)..Thanks,for being a product that FINALLY lives up to its claim!</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty oily and the pores are larger than I&#x27;d like. After using this cleanser for 3 months or so, I do notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture was what I picked up on the first time I used it. It is pretty thick, and the beads are definitely micro. It didn&#x27;t feel real grainy, which I liked. A little goes a long way, and since this tube is so big it should last a while. I haven&#x27;t even used a quarter of mine yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with Origins Zero Oil Moisturizer and Origins Clear Improvements Charcoal Mask. I found them to be pretty effective at making my pores look smaller, cleaner and less overall oil production. It has a really good price point. Many a department store cleansers can cost 3-4X as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work over time, so don&#x27;t expect to see much difference in the beginning. I will buy it again and continue my routine. I&#x27;ve seen good improvement in the last few months.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and still swear by it</li>
    <li> This stuff is a little more pricey than I&#x27;d like for a face wash but consistent use will reduce the size of your pores. It STINGS like all get out if you get it in your eyes though so wash your face carefully, and with your eyes completely closed.</li>
    <li> it does not have enough micro-beads, to resuface the skin.  It does not clean out  comedones</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. Having always had difficult skin-acne &amp; rosacea, I needed a skin cleaner and conditioner that would minimize the flaws in my shin while helping with skin tone and radiance. This is the product for me!</li>
    <li> This is the EXFOLIATING cleanser, which has microbeads.  They do a good job of gently removing the dry, dead skin off of my face and leaves it feeling clean.  I have no idea why this is priced the way it is.  You can find it at Target for half the price.</li>
    <li> i like the way it scrubs my face, keeping pores clean and my face flake free.  i use it with the OLAY powered brush.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena and use a lot of their products so I really wanted to like this but I just can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve never had a face wash burn my eyes so bad in my entire life. At first I thought it was bc I had my contacts in but that wasn&#x27;t the case. No matter what I did or how well I rinsed my eyes would burn so badly I couldn&#x27;t open them until after I dried my face and held the towel pressed to my eyes for a minute or two. I would even make sure not to get the cleanser anywhere near my eyes but even then they would still burn. I used the wash for about 2 1/2 weeks hoping it would get better but it never did and I threw the whole bottle away. Soooooo incredibly painful!!</li>
    <li> I was using Olay face wash with microbeads.  I think I like it better than the Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser. It seems to clean well, but with the microbeads it is a little too harsh I think to use every day.</li>
    <li> I washed my face with this once yesterday, and once the day before and yesterday in the evening, a good portion of the right side of my face and a few under my chin broke out in ugly hives! It itches horribly and it really hurts. To make matters worse, I had to go to work looking like this. I didn&#x27;t want to put on makeup that would irritate my skin so I was forced to leave the house looking like a pepperoni pizza. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And also, when I was washing my face with this, I noticed that the scrubbing beads in this were SCRATCHING my face. Not a comfortable exfoliation, but like sandpaper. And this cleanser has a very noticeable chemical smell to it. I wish that I had never wasted my money on this product, and I wish that I had never put this on my face!</li>
    <li> You should buy this because it works! It does not dry out your skin and it DOES make a difference within the first few days just like someone else mentioned on these reviews (which convinced ME to get it). Now I tell you...It works well! I like and if the L&#x27;Oreal stuff I have after this stuff doesn&#x27;t work as well...I will be back to get this stuff. I know that it will not break my skin out even more, but it also cleans it very well. You can feel the clean after you are done and it won&#x27;t dry out your skin (unless you use too much like I did in the beginning. You only need like less than a quarter size to do a good clean.</li>
    <li> It is a gentle cleanser yet has enough of a &amp;#34;gravel&amp;#34; feel that makes the skin feel and look clean.  It does what it says. I am pleased</li>
    <li> i love this stuff, and i rather order on amazon then go to walomart anyday, heck i will pay for shipping not to go to walomart but really this stuff is perfect for my skin. keeps the pours clear and smaller.</li>
    <li> I bought the whole line and love it. Meaning the daily wash, toner and the pore refining cleanser.  Read plenty of good reviews and have to say they are true. I advise anyone to buy! The pores on my face do appear reduced and tighter. The ingredients in this product are great for aging skin too.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in college and even at the young age has become somewhat a guru on face washes.  She works hard on a clean face and has tried soo many face washes.  Along comes NEUTROGENA PORE REFINING EXFOLIATING CLEANSER and she has found the one.  She loves it.  She has bragged on it.  Results were visible to her in a week. Cleaner, nicer skin in a week.  &amp;#34;This is the one ! &amp;#34;  One big caution, keep it away from the eyes, it can burn.  Very HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its advertising.  Love it!  Better than almost anything else I have used.  I will buy again when this one is gone.</li>
    <li> The cream is refining and leaves you with deep clean sensation. Makes skin tone seem nice and even. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Fine product but didn&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever to my pours. I thought it would at least make a minor difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Neutrogena, which was recommended by a dermatologist.  This product is effective and well priced.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and so far so good! Even using it twice daily, it&#x27;s not too irritating, and my skin looks fine, but will probably need some more time to see if the pore-refining does work.&lt;br /&gt;Also the cleanser arrived on time and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> This pore refiner work great. I&#x27;m starting to see results already. I would definitely recommend this neutrogena product to anyone looking for results.</li>
    <li> Weird strong smell. Use it every other day and bought the toner also that has same weird smell. I don&#x27;t know if it works cause i have not been using it as ofter because of smell.......</li>
    <li> The cleanser makes my face feel really clean after I use it and helps get rid of the oil and dirt in my pores.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see if it really reduces the size of my pores, but I trust Neutrogena products, so I&#x27;m hoping this particular Neutrogena product will live up to its name.</li>
    <li> It is back in stores for less than 8 bucks..don&#x27;t pay more than that for this great product that is wonderful!</li>
    <li> For the first three decades of my life, my skin was smooth and problem-free. Then last year, 30 happened, and my skin lost its mind. My cheeks are now incredibly oily with increasingly large pores. My forehead is home to small red bumps that eventually turn to spots--even though I never pop anything on my face. During the last few months, I have spent TONS of money looking for some product that would help my skin. I&#x27;ve tried everything from incredibly expensive treatments recommended by my derm to cheapie drugstore brands that are heralded by online reviewers. This weekend, during my weekly visit to Target, I happened upon this cleanser. I&#x27;ve used it THREE times, and my pores have disappeared. Vanished. The bumps on my head are gone, and I think the spots will follow. I cannot believe that this MIRACLE product was less than ten bucks. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. The only con is that it isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; and the smell is a bit off putting. On the other hand the results are wonderful. My pores are significantly less apparent and my skin feels soft. Additionally, no break out issues.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my skin.</li>
    <li> Wow, clean skin!  I have used everything. It never gets all the gunk off. This does. Very nice product. I bought. Three just to be safe.</li>
    <li> This product worked a miracle on my face. I read about alpha/beta hydroxy acids in cleansers and how they work and for the past 6 months I have been searching for a quality alpha beta hydroxy cleanser that works. I found this product on the internet and ordered it, hoping that I would have good results again. I did and I would recommend trying this to anyone with difficult adult acne. Also, the exfoliating beads are very fine, so it&#x27;s not a scrub. I think some people expected the large micro beads that you see in many exfoliating cleansers, and that is not the case for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some background : I have severe adult acne that started at age 19, I am now 25, and I have tried everything. To give you an idea of the severity of my acne, it basically looked like I had a pimple beard. The acne was horrible on my cheeks and went down to my chin. And even if I didn&#x27;t have pimples covering a spot on my cheeks, the skin was red. I dealt with it through the years and just kept trying to find a cleanser that worked. This cleanser worked. After I had used it for only a week I could see MY FACE. It didn&#x27;t completely clear my face in a week but it was obvious that my acne was healing I&#x27;ve been using it for well over a month now the acne isn&#x27;t covering my cheeks. For the first time in years I can see skin and not red bumps or red skin it&#x27;s my skin, normal skin skin! It does take some time though. If you have acne it needs to heal and that takes a little while, I was patient and just kept using the product and it worked out great for me!to heal and that takes a little while, I was patient and just kept using the product and it worked out great for me!</li>
    <li> love this product , all of there product are good</li>
    <li> I recommend this product if you suffer with oily, acne-prone sensitive skin.  This gentle cleanser is good for those of us who want to keep the breakouts to a minimum &amp; it&#x27;s recommended  for daily use.  I use a makeup remover then wash my face twice 30 seconds each. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the size of my pores but I can say my skin is cleaner &amp; no irritation (no stinging, burning or redness).     Amazon.com carries this at a much more affordable price than any other stores (at least the few that haven&#x27;t  discontinued it).    I&#x27;m satisfied with this product &amp; I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Does not do what it said. Plus I&#x27;m pretty sure the package I got was already used because it was opened and it was out of date. No wonder it was so cheap. Beware</li>
    <li> It doesnt work so effectively to  me .</li>
    <li> Ill stick with cetaphil</li>
    <li> This is possibly one of the best acne products I&#x27;ve used thus far. It makes my skin feel nice, cleans and minimizes my pores and makes me skin feel much more refreshed. I love that this doesn&#x27;t have huge beads in it like other cleansers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does dry your skin a little bit if you use it too much though. Definitely good for 2 times a week :)</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser and the price.  I previously used a Dr Mura* aha/bha cleanser and paid 36.00 for almost the same size as Neutrogena.  My first thought was I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the smell, but now I like it because I realize it is the active ingredients that are working to make my skin youthful.</li>
    <li> Shop around. Found it for $7.99 at CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using this product and I will try to update this review with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sex: Male&lt;br /&gt;Age: 33</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care what anyone else says I know the capability of this product. I used to have porcelain skin but as I became a teen my pores became larger (hereditary) I never had horrible acne but regardless, I had it and just as I thought I was outgrowing it (age 17-18 ) I got cystic acne a bit on my face which are these large deep cysts that you can&#x27;t pop and they can scar regardless just from sitting on your skin so long. And besides that thanks to my pores i always had troubled spots where blackheads stayed. During all this time I tried everything from proactive, rubbing alcohol, tetracycline medication, other facial cleansers, medical/spa facials,  organic mixtures. I would get improvement but never results like some ppl claim (like the proactive commercials). So now I&#x27;m 18 going on 19 and I found this like 3 weeks ago and OMG I can now officially say my skin is miraculously changing. It&#x27;s soft, 80% of the blackheads I could never get rid of are actually gone, dead skin cells and uneven texture are completely gone. No exaggeration I&#x27;m getting my porcelain skin back. It&#x27;s only been 3 weeks maybe a bit less and I can go out without any makeup and look radiant. This is a miracle product. The key is to massage it on your face (anywhere else) and leave it on for a few minutes or more, then massage your face with a hot wash cloth and Voilà!! It also evened my skin tone ;)</li>
    <li> The product itself was very good, just after the first two days using it i saw a difference in my skin appearance, pores were smaller, skin softer! However use caution if you have sensitive skin to tuff chemicals or any of the ingredients in the product because irritation did occur.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser! Not harsh at all, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin (I have combination skin, with oily forehead and nose and some acne). It does contain tiny dust-like exfoliating beads, but they&#x27;re so little, that it&#x27;s not abrasive at all. Just makes sure to avoid your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s a big tube for very very good price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if I saw noticeably smaller pores, but it burned the hell out of my eyes. I could say be careful to not get it in your eyes, but I tried that for a month and it&#x27;s pretty inevitable. Choosing something more gentle next time.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin, this product makes my skin so comfortable. I strongly recommend this cleanser for some who has a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it has significantly reduced my pore sizes.  I couldn&#x27;t find this on the grocery shelf.  thankfully i was able to find it here.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce their pore sizes.  it&#x27;s not harsh, so no redness or flaking.</li>
    <li> Adored as expected. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It is an ok choice - there isn&#x27;t any burning with this product, but I would buy it again.  probably</li>
    <li> Use sparingly at first.  I tried to use everyday, and it dried my face quite a bit.  Otherwise after you figure out how often to use, it&#x27;ll really good.</li>
    <li> When Neutrogena stopped selling this in stores in favor of a new &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; product, I was in despair. I use this all over - face and in the shower. It is the single best skin care product I have ever used.</li>
