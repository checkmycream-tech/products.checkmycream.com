    <li> When I opened the box the heart had come apart in my hands and I can not get it to attach anyMore</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B008X20V6A SHANY Cosmetics All In One Heart Makeup Gift Set]]I BOUGHT A MAKE UP SET ( SHANY)BY AMAZON.COM. THIS IS VERY GOOD, I CAN CHOOSE WHAT EVER I WANT TO BUY, AND WITH JUST ONE CLICK I PAID FOR THAT WITH A GOOD PRICE. AND AMAZING: TO MORROW I GOT MY PACKAGE IN MY MAIL BOX . FAST , EASY, AND COMFORTABLE SHOPPING. I COULDN&#x27;T GO TO THE STORE TO LOOK FOR THIS MAKE UP SET (SHANY), BUT I TRY ONLINE TO SHOP. I WENT AMAZON .COM AND I CHECKED FOR MAKE UP SETS . I SAW THE BEST ONE THAT I LIKE IT. I HAVE ACCOUNT WITH AMAZON FOR LONG TIME. THIS MAKES ME HAPPY , WHEN I GET THE BEST DEAL. WHEN SOME THING IS NOT IN THE STORES, I CAN BUY IT FROM AMAZON. AMAZON IS AMAZING.THIS PRODUCT THAT I BOUGHT IT, IS GOOD. BEFORE I BOUGHT IT FROM STORE, BUT I COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT ANY MORE IN THE STORE.AND I LIKE TO HAVE IT AGAIN.  THE SHAPE IS CUTE AND PRETTY. EVERY BODY SAW IT, SAID HOW IS CUTE!... I WENT AMAZON. AND I FIND IT . I DID ORDER IT YESTERDAY, AND TO DAY I GOT IT. I AM HAPPY. MY MAKE UP IS CUTE AND PRETTY. THANKS SHANY AND AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I WOULD HAVE LOVED THE PRODUCT UNFORTUNATELY THE FACE POWDER WAS BUSTED UP AND WAS ALL OVER EVERYTHING IN THE KIT...ODDLY ENOUGH I ORDERED THE KIT FOR THE SHADE OF FACE POWDER SO REALLY I DID NOT GET WHAT I WANTED.  IF YOU CAN SEND A REPLACEMENT I WOULD BE GRATEFUL  XOXO SINCERELY  PEN NAME&lt;br /&gt;VOICE OF TRUTH</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my sister. I thought it had everything for a nice make-up in a small package</li>
    <li> This make up set makes the perfect gift. It is easy to carry, has everything a woman needs for make up and a beautiful look, nice variety of colors and tones. I recommend it, for it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent  idea for a gift. Practical and complete, good quality materials.</li>
    <li> I love all the Shany products. They are cruelty free and that is very important to me. I have mentioned Shany on my website, [...] and my blog.</li>
    <li> I received it today, the kit was broken. Looks like it was made of cheap plastic. And on top of that one of the compartments has all broken powder in it. I am returning the product right away.&lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be a gift for my wife on her birthday and now I will buy some other cosmetic product for her.&lt;br /&gt;Was a big mistake ordering this</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors and the cheek colors look natural.  What I don&#x27;t like are the brushes, they are too small and hard to use</li>
    <li> This is the perfect kit for a pre-teen/teenager or for a first makeup kit.  The heart shape is cute and girly.  The products are typical Shany high quality - good color payout and staying power.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 10 year old daughter.  It didn&#x27;t last 1 day.  She broke it and then I threw it away.  It&#x27;s very cheaply made and is just gross after you start using it.  The colors get all mixed up, eye shadow in the lipstick and pieces break off.  It had to get out of my house.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is of good quality ,The makeup was alittle messed up because of shipment but other than that it gets 5 stars, I will order Shany products in the future:) Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Very smooth, nice colors and amazing packaging. I haven&#x27;t used it now, but I have used Shany&#x27;s product before. I love its products, gives a nice makeover, lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> I like the size its a compact makeup kit for travelling or to gift to someone the quality and the price is good</li>
    <li> the makeup was really good but the case came broken. otherwise i would have kept it.</li>
    <li> Some broken off, open the powder are everywhere.</li>
    <li> its got nice eye shadows for the price but the applicators i think could use some work a few have already broke which kinda makes me not want to use it. but overall its good stuff for the price. the eye shadow and lip balms are good quality</li>
    <li> it was for gift and person loved it</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets for my teenage nieces as a gift. When I got it I was very disappointed because a box inside was completely covered by blue-purple powder. Some shades were crashed in both sets. I believe a cause of that is a very poor packaging. These make up sets were thrown into the big box without any wrapping. Unfortunately, I had to return it back.</li>
    <li> the case came apart soon after my starting to use it-getting the applicators out to use was tedious-the blush colors are very false looking and the eye-shadow started to break apart very quickly-also the mascara was dry when I opened it</li>
    <li> Being a great lover of makeup, I know the value that high quality makeup palettes have.  This is a high quality palette, with all of the makeup that a girl could ever possibly want or need, from lipstick to mascara.  This is a great valentine&#x27;s gift for any girl.  And the user will definately appreciate this gift.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect gift set. It is so cute! I made sure to order more than one. Christmas is a couple of months away and I want to get a head start! So stoked! Shany&#x27;s company is reliable.</li>
    <li> Surprised my daughter with this and she was so happy for it! It caught my eye because of the shape and how it was meant for her to have it!</li>
    <li> I have never seen a make up case look like a heart this is truly a unique idea. Look at all the colors you can choose from and a mirror to check how pretty it all looks. I find it nice that how each layer of make up fits together nicely. Looks so small and compact to fit virtually anywhere !</li>
    <li> Men, if you are shopping for the women in your life then look no further this would be the perfect gift. This high quality makeup comes in a cute heart shaped designed case and carry&#x27;s  everything. This is just a great way to show your love and taste in quality.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with it either. The glosses give amazingly pigmented color...not like most glosses that come in sets like this and they&#x27;re super hydrating. You do need to use a fairly decent amount of gloss to get full on color so the first time I used it, I hit pan on the pink one. :-/ but that&#x27;s not a huge deal to me--just throwing that out there in case anyone complains about that which they shouldn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s still a great deal with everything you&#x27;re getting. The eyeshadows have great color and pigment and the blush/bronzer seems to be pretty finely milled and gives great color as well. For some reason I&#x27;m just not into the heart shaped design (that&#x27;s just my personal preference though) but wanted to buy it anyways because I thought it was such a great deal, which it is. I&#x27;m probably going to give it to my little sister though. It seems to be more of a gift for teens and people just starting out with makeup. It would make a great stocking stuffer!!!! Also, it&#x27;s not too big or bulky so it would be super easy to stash in your purse or gym bag for touch ups throughout the day. I would definitely recommend again. Not disappointed,</li>
    <li> Product was small. However, had a lot inside; much more than I expected. It was a gift for my 12 year old niece and she LOVED it! Nice quality and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I just love SHANY cosmetics and so I wanted a kit that would travel with me in my purse and this has everything I needed. The makeup is really beautiful and top quality. It is secure and doesn&#x27;t crumble all over the place. You have a great variety and can freshen up all your makeup on the go with this one quality kit instead of a whole bag full of products. AMAZING!! I love SHANY cosmetics!</li>
    <li> Other are all well, powdery cake is already broken</li>
    <li> This is a great little kit!  I think people have missed the size listed and are \\&quot;surprised\\&quot; with how small it is.  It&#x27;s perfect for tossing into a purse or gym bag if you find yourself needing to touch up your make up or for taking your look from day to evening.  The brushes are what you&#x27;d expect, tiny but functional, and you can always use your own brushes :)</li>
    <li> it is really cute that its in a heart shape also great gift to gift someone. It has colors to match any skintone. It really is All in one !</li>
    <li> Awww, this is such a presh product! The heart shape just makes it that much better! This would make theee perfect gift, girls!</li>
    <li> This order was not packed securely. When I opened the package, all of the powder was all over the inside of the box All of the powder was crumbled. I returned it to Amazon and got a store credit. Was very happy with Amazon, very happy with delivery, very very unhappy with the product. I really think my teenage granddaughter would have loved this product. Very sad</li>
    <li> very good product. but the image is bigger</li>
    <li> This cute heart shaped compact has everything you need in a cute little package. This is ideal for teens and preteens who will appreciate the subtle colors and gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Love this eye makeup set.  I like the variety of colors and different combinations that I can do with them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old granddaughter who has just started getting into makeup.I was really pleased with it, and I think she will be too. She will love being able to carry a complete assortment of cosmetics and applicators in  a pretty little heart shaped case which cleverly opens up into trays, and is small enough to put in her purse for on the go touch ups. The price is right for a teenager. My order was processed quickly and I received it within a few days, in perfect condition. It has a good selection of shades too. Definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The item arrived with the blush completely broken and falling apart as powder. I saw good reviews about it and went ahead to purchase one. I have to return it. Wish it had arrived clean, I would have definitely kept it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 11 year old niece.  When it arrived, I was dissapointed in the size.  It is very small &amp; after paying $18 I wasn&#x27;t happy.  I returned the product (minus shipping) &amp; went to a local store &amp; purchsed a much larger make-up set for cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my god daughter who wanted to start using make up. This is a perfect little starter set for a beginner who is just learning to start using make up.</li>
    <li> Use it every day,  last long and looks nice, i can&#x27;t ask for more, nice colors, very good produc, i will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1N3T6G26DLIWA]]Variety is the spice of life and Shany seems to have done that with this heart-shaped makeup kit chock full of a nice assortment of cosmetics from gloss to eyeshadow.  The heart case itself is 4\\&quot; x 4 1/4\\&quot; and opens and swings apart in to present a three-tiered palette of makeup.  There are 28 makeup components, applicators, and a mirror beneath the top of the heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Gorgeous heart shape makes it perfect for gifting&lt;br /&gt;►  Packed with makeup essentials&lt;br /&gt;►  Colors complement every skin tone and season&lt;br /&gt;►  Super high-grade materials used in production to ensure customer satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;►  Not tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel feature makes everything accessible at once.  Of course if you are a seasoned pro at applying makeup, you&#x27;ll most likely want to take a pass because you&#x27;ll have your own favorites.  If you have a young teen who is just getting into makeup, this would probably make a perfect gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bit in this palette for every skin tone and plenty of different colors to experiment with.  This is a shimmer palette that ranges from matte to bold and bright.  This small selection is perfect for the young experimenter who would like to add a bit of sparkle to their look.  Good quality, a fun selection, and perfect for a teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> got this for my GF and she liked it although she didn&#x27;t use most of the colors. still a good deal tho.</li>
    <li> I bought this to gift my cousins back in India. they really loved it and the colors are very good. I wanna buy this next time again</li>
    <li> i love this product it makes applying makeup easy! its so pigmented! i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me! i wish i could find more palettes like this one!</li>
    <li> It gives you a little bit of everything you need to get started in makeup and it comes in a neat little package. Great for young girls and beginners.</li>
    <li> Be sure to read the dimensions carefully!  It is much smaller than I expected.  But, my granddaughter loved it anyway.</li>
    <li> Perfect Valentine Gift in a nice shaped gift box. Beautiful colors to enhance and beatify facial appearance. I would order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Here is a beautiful cosmetic case filled with horrible make up. The make up crumbled after using it. The cosmetic case broke apart. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Powder in kit was broken and had contaminated the whole set. I purchased this as a mother&#x27;s day gift. Wish I had checked the condition of the item before I gifted it. It was embarassing.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this product caused me to have an allergic reaction! My lips got extremely swollen ! This product  is not as beautiful as the picture! Its cheaply made and honestly i could get a better quality product from the Dollar Tree! Mascara is dry and clumpy and some of the eye shadow is cracked. The bronzer was not so bronze and it was too dry and clumpy to use. In the inside of the heart, the paint is chipped off. It&#x27;s a mess! It looks like the box was opened. I believe this make up was sitting in the inventory for too long and it became expired. Honestly im very disappointed and will not buy again from this seller! I would send it back but it&#x27;s not even worth that! All in all don&#x27;t waste your money on this product it&#x27;s horrible!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these make up sets just so that my nieces would stop playing with my expensive make up. I love that these have almost everything all in one. I say almost everything because with the popularity of Youtube beauty gurus, I have my 7 year old niece asking for things like concealer to cover up her dark circles(let&#x27;s not even talk about contouring make up either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all the pretty colors in the set, not crazy clown colors. One thing I&#x27;d have to comment on is that one of the mini mascara tubes was dried out when I checked the set. You get what you pay for in terms of quality, but overall I think the product would make any little girl happy.</li>
    <li> Just buy looking at the shape of this product.. you can see that it is cute! A very good idea for a gift! The makeup is pretty good quality! The eye shadow goes on well and last long! There are many different shades of eye shadow, lip color and many more! This product is a good investment! :)</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:a80bcbda61b85c57b17455fdbea83b56]] Some makeup kits are heavy on the eye-shadow and have less of other products. This kit isn&#x27;t that way, and it great for the gloss-lover. With 6 glosses in it, it&#x27;s got one for ever season and outfit. The colors range from deep red to light pink, with even a peachy-orange color in the middle. Tucked in between all the glosses is a selection of brushes and even a mini mascara in black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second slide that is on top of the glosses is a palette of 4 blushes in pink, peach, a light rust color and a neutral tan color. Next to the blushes is a single pressed face powder in a light color with golden undertones. The top slide that sits over the blushes and powder is a palette of 17 eye-shadows. All are very wearable colors, and nothing that will make you look like a clown. Light blues, greens, neutral tans and browns and a single light pink and light orange color. There is also a charcoal color for making smoky eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole things folds up into a compact design and in the top there is a round mirror for helping apply the makeup. This is a really cute set with very realistic colors and shades for wearing. Nothing in this set is clown-colors. Cute for taking along for travel, giving as a gift, or a compact way to carry all your makeup if you&#x27;re one who likes to have all your makeup with you all the time. It&#x27;s even a good size for keeping in your desk at work or in your locker at school. Then you always have a whole set of makeup on hand for touch-ups, but in a super small compact case. very cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who lives 70 miles from my house and delivered it today and she opened it and it was all cracked powder. I was going to send it back but forgot it in Jacksonville and will not drive all the way back to get it to send back.  Cute but cheaply made.</li>
    <li> the shape is just pretty the heart is just lovely! and the colors are pretty for every day use and it comes with everything you need!</li>
    <li> Another super cute and high quality SHANY product. This case offers you all of your makeup needs in a super cute package/case! What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> one of the powders came crushed over all its ok they are a gift for my girlfriend thats the sad part</li>
    <li> I bought this makup kit for my wife.she like it very much.This product is very good for travel. It fits in purse easily.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect gift set.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to someone and it was broken upon arrival. One of the eye shadow was broken and the powder was all over the case and when i opened it further, even the compact inside was broken, Did not expect this from shany.</li>
    <li> This compact is good for anyone who travels and does not wish to take too many of their cosmetics.  This is sort of an all in one.  It is great for freshening up your makeup as well while out for a night on the town or anywhere you may need to.  It feels so soft to the skin. The compact is a bit flimsy but o.k. for the money.  I will probably buy more of this product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the cute case the makeup comes in. The stuff inside is also great quality and long lasting. I use mine when I go camping it works great because I have everything I need in one little case.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these as gifts for my stepdaughters. The light colored powder is broken in both of them. One of them was pretty minor, but in the other the powder had spread all of the case, including onto the lip glosses and mirror. An eyeshadow in that one was broken as well. I&#x27;m going to try to clean it up as best I can, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
    <li> Hard to open and close broke easily</li>
    <li> It came apart but I still like the makeup.  It was a little messy with the lipsticks.  It was hard to apply powder.</li>
    <li> We purchased this as a gift for my daughter&#x27; s friends 12TH birthday.  She absolutely loves it and I was told she wears it everyday.  The set comes with everything you would need including mascara.  The heart shape makes it fun especially for a teenage girl.  My daughter is now begging me to purchase one for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll let my 10 year old great niece put this review into her own words after opening the gift Christmas morning and discovering what was inside: &amp;#34;This is sooooo cool.&amp;#34; She was well pleased. What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> i love this product it makes applying makeup easy! its so pigmented! i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me! i wish i could find more palettes like this one!</li>
    <li> Awww this is so pretty I don&#x27;t know if I would give this away! It has everything you need in a heart!</li>
    <li> Perfect for a gift. Though size is very small for price. Products look much bigger in pictures.</li>
    <li> Ilove the product, my wife so happy with it ,all the colors its look great its pretty size for traveling .am fully satisfied with the product and the shipping .it was on the time</li>
    <li> When it came and I opened the box, there was makeup from one of the pressed powder (the peach colored one) all over the case and in the make up. If only Shany would put like &amp;#34;HANDLE WITH CARE; FRAGILE&amp;#34; on the boxes before being shipped cause I&#x27;ve found my orders at my door outside so it&#x27;s likely the UPS dude literally DROPPED them on the porch. Everything else is intact but the mascara.....too gunky and thank goodness easy to rub it off cause I&#x27;ve felt a little burning near my eye. I was thinking about putting water in the stuff to dilute it for being so thick. (You might want to just get a seperate mascara and makeup brush set the mini brushes are pathetic.) The heart joint did break pretty easily but I can still manage and it&#x27;s better to dettach that part (where it broke off) above the lip color to put the eyeshadow in so that wasn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty case worth the cheap price :)</li>
    <li> There was absolutely no mascara in the tube.  It is bone dry.  I am so disappointed.  The lip brush bristles come off on your lips.  I could live with that and use another brush, but the lack of mascara was a complete and utter disappointment.  The shadow and blush are okay I guess.</li>
    <li> When I received this product I was very excited. Immediately upon opening it I knew it was going to be great. Not only is it in a cute heart shape (almost like an accessory), but it also a good size and easy to put in your purse. The set has a little bit of everything. I was able to use it for an everyday office look and then change up my look for night time. The eye shadows go on very smooth and stay on all day, as does the blush. There is a great variety of colors for everybody. My eyes usually get very irritated from wearing makeup, but I found that when I put on this eye shadow I did not have any issues or irritation with my eyes. If you suffer from allergies or have sensitive eyes I would definitely recommend this product, it is good for people with sensitive skin. Anybody can use this. Whether you are familiar with makeup or are new to it there is something in the set up everyone. The picture that was on amazon is very accurate. The only surprise was that it was better than I thought it would be! The only complaint I have is that Fedex originally lost my package; this has nothing to do with Amazon or Shany Cosmetics though. I will definitely order more products by Shany and use their products more often. I am glad I got this product! I am glad that Shany has updated their website and will make sure to go on there to buy more of their products. I would recommend this product to all of my friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish was different about this product is that the eye shadows are more glittery. That is just my personal choice the colors are all good choices and I will still continue to wear them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it! It came on time and looks exactly like the picture.  The size is perfect to put into a purse or small back pack. Many shades to choose from and looks like it is a good quality product.</li>
    <li> The part that spins around broke off right away.  You can put it back on but it keeps falling off.</li>
