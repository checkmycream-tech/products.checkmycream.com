      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found these products online.</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the hair spray.</li>
      <li>I love how the hair serum makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one!</li>
      <li>The styling spray is a light hold but enough to do the job and smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>The serum is my favorite, takes my frizz and gives it shine and calms it to a smooth silk.</li>
      <li>I use heat tools but not everyday and my hair is shiny and healthy now!!</li>
      <li>The hairspray is very light and doesn&#x27;t keep the fly aways at bay when you put your hair back but does help maintain the style.</li>
      <li>The hair spray is a bit too strong</li>
      <li>the shampoo is amazing not so much the conditioner</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s important that things don&#x27;t spill when shipping.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much, i purchased it twice.</li>
      <li>I love the way they smell and this was a very reasonable price</li>
      <li>(They would claim that the original price was $75).</li>
      <li>Original packaging.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but I just wish the smell would stay in my hair longer, other than that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>Love love like no other, my hair is damaged.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to some great results but found my previous moisturizing shampoo did a better job</li>
      <li>I also give it a 4 because the shipping was fast!!</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells just as amazing as the serum, although the conditioner has a different scent...</li>
      <li>Only issue is the hairspray top wasn&#x27;t secure and some spilled in the bag.</li>
      <li>Definately works and worth the price.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Saw them at the mall all together for like $200 so definately worth the price on here</li>
      <li>I bought tjis because I really loved the serum due the softness and smell that leaves on my hair.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell fabulous, but it make my hair feel healthy and helps so much with the frizz.</li>
      <li>I really love the Styling Spray, when I curl my hair it last soooooo long and all the products make my hair smell so nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like them to include a pretty scent in them.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the Styling spray, just because it&#x27;s more of a hairspray, but I personally don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes your hair feel especially while being washed!</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and it made it so soft and smooth and shiny when I straightened it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely love Herstyler!! Not only does it smell fabulous, but it make my hair feel healthy and helps so much with the frizz.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Original packaging.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair soft and a lot less frizzy. Only issue is the hairspray top wasn&#x27;t secure and some spilled in the bag.</li>
    <li> The hair spray is a bit too strong</li>
    <li> It works well but it doesnt tame my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Made big difference the first use.definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> The shampoo is a little drying, but the conditioner makes my hair very slippery. Nice! the argon oil smells great!  I don&#x27;t really use the hairspray. Nothing wrong with it, just don&#x27;t really use hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cheap and nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. I don&#x27;t think the ingredients are good for your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these products online. The kiosk is ridiculous on the price. I just wish I had bought the flat iron online too. I will say I do love the iron. Great investment but you can get it for a lot less on this website.</li>
    <li> Smells very very good but doesn&#x27;t work well as a serum.</li>
    <li> loooooved it...great price for a great product and quick shipping...one happy girl! makes my hair look good not greasy !</li>
    <li> Tried the serum at the mall but so expensive, so is their website. I have curly hair and it made it so soft and smooth and shiny when I straightened it. Love it!</li>
    <li> the shampoo is amazing not so much the conditioner the serume amazing and the styling spray. Amazing Amazing Amazing. love it</li>
    <li> Love shampoo, conditioner, of course the serum, not to thrilled about hair spray, sorry. goes on to wet , and dry&#x27;s really hard.  wish you sold bigger tubes of shampoo an conditioner. thanks</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft and nice, added definition to my curls and smells very good. The serum makes the hair have a healthy shine and the hair spray will hold the hair somewhat in place. I would and will recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It left my hair feeling really soft. I also like how it smells. The oil compliments the shampoo and conditioner. I have not used the hair spray so I do not know how good that works.  Great product though.</li>
    <li> I was always bombarded by the hair stylists&#x27; at the mall at the kiosks, and they introduced me to the HerStyler serum. I loved it and would always ask for more free samples. Their prices were always overpriced...selling just the serum for almost $30 alone. (They would claim that the original price was $75). So I found this set on here, and purchases it. It came in the mail as expected, no complaints. I don&#x27;t use the Styling spray, just because it&#x27;s more of a hairspray, but I personally don&#x27;t like it. The shampoo smells just as amazing as the serum, although the conditioner has a different scent...I don&#x27;t use the shampoo/conditioner anymore just because I got extensions, and these products have sulfate (sulfate isn&#x27;t good for extensions). But I use the serum on my extensions and it leaves them soft and smooth. Definitely a good investment considering you will pay for just the serum for $25.</li>
    <li> Loved it, did everything it was supposed to do. I would recommend to anyone and I will be buying again</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a year. Findings this product at a very good price made it affordable to me to buy.</li>
    <li> Love love like no other, my hair is damaged. With herstyler u cant tell at all. I have people telling me my hair looks beautiful, and they cant even stop touching it. :) great price too</li>
    <li> Love the product! Definately works and worth the price. Saw them at the mall all together for like $200 so definately worth the price on here</li>
    <li> Love the smell of these items! Love the way it makes your hair feel especially while being washed! highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! Smells good and makes my long hair soft without being greasy. I use heat tools but not everyday and my hair is shiny and healthy now!! I have used the expensive Morrocan oil brand loved it too but for the price this I away better</li>
    <li> This whole package is perfect for my hair and I&#x27;m buying for a friend</li>
    <li> Product did not seem to be the same as what I purchased at the mall.  The scent was not the great scent I really admired from the mall purchased.  Did not have the same lasting fragrance.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> this is amazing. simply amazing. I liked it so much, i purchased it twice. even the shampoo is really nourishing</li>
    <li> Works well with my hair.</li>
    <li> I love how the hair serum makes my hair feel. I use it every time I straighten my hair. The styling spray is very strong and holds well.</li>
    <li> The shampoo &amp;conditioner  is awesom. I will be purshing more. And the hair serum is wonderful!!!!!! My hair fells so silky and smooth ! I have turned my coworker on too it, she love it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is okay.  I thought it would smell better than it does, really do not like the smell.  It does make your hair soft and the smell stays in your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for her birthday present and she loved it... will be buying more. Thank you</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner is great. Unfortunately, that was all I recieved in my order so I can&#x27;t really give a whole review.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works great on my thick wavy hair that is difficult to straighten.</li>
    <li> Great products but this purchase not a good one. Received a new set kit that was open and missing some of the products. Had to reordered from another seller.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  The Shampoo and Conditioner leave my African American hair so soft and smooth.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore!  I have the Agave treatment on my hair and when I have a lot of new growth the shampoo and condition lengthen the time that I can go between treatments.  Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
    <li> The products are just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t see any major difference in my hair even with the Gel which everyone has rated so high. I was really looking forward to some great results but found my previous moisturizing shampoo did a better job and that&#x27;s something I get from Nuskin products. I will be going back to my previous product even though this is less expensive.</li>
    <li> IMHO.. the products do a nice job. I have long hair on the fine side with a wave. The oil is a little too heavy for my hair type to use everyday ... good for a treatments though and it perks up the waves. The styling spray is my favorite of the products ... not too heavy or sticky  I&#x27;d like them to include a pretty scent in them. Styling spray works great over the oil for my hair.</li>
    <li> The hairspray is very light and doesn&#x27;t keep the fly aways at bay when you put your hair back but does help maintain the style. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather like regular shampoos so it doesn&#x27;t feel like the hair is getting washed but it is. However, if you have oily hair don&#x27;t use this. After a couple weeks I feel like I need to use another shampoo because it can make your hair feel a bit oily after a while (but oil is good for your hair). But these products definitely transform your hair if it is too dry or damaged. Helps with frizz as well. Plus, these products are very expensive normally and this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product. I learned about this brand on a trip to California. I loved the smell, the argan oil.. Everything! The price is also very low for such a professional salon quality product. I love the hair spray. It just saved my hair.  Thanks HerStyler!!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I already love the shampoo and conditioner from previous use.  The serum and styling spray though are a new big hit.  I finally found hair products that don&#x27;t destroy my hair.</li>
    <li> its not even the real her styler it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already had all of these products except for the hair spray. So I already loved them and the hair spray is just as good, and they smell great! I wont curl or straighten my hair w/o the herstyler argon oil.</li>
    <li> Amazing hair product. My hair feels silky soft. I will continue to purchase &amp; use. The hair serum is my favorite!!</li>
    <li> I love all of the herstyler products.  They work great!  I love the way they smell and this was a very reasonable price so I can afford to use them regularly.</li>
    <li> I got this for 15$ This product smells wonderful ,&amp; also feels fantastic! Each item shampoo, conditioner, the masque for your hair,&amp;  the extra hold hair spray was utterly what my hair needed! Her Styler I recommend highly to other women with curly frizzy, or even straight hair. I&#x27;m definitely buying this product again in the future!</li>
    <li> I like it and so did my daughter. I like the smell it was different and yes I would buy it again if I had too.</li>
    <li> I really love the Styling Spray, when I curl my hair it last soooooo long and all the products make my hair smell so nice. Some people might not like the Styling spray because its wet, but if you just hold it a little away from your hair it wont ruin your curls or make your hair go crazy.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels in my hair and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. I now will be purchasing herstyler products. I already have the curling wand and straighter and they are absolutely amazing, better than anything I used in a salon. So i trusted the products would be great as well, and they smell amazing and are wonderful. Only down side is the shampoo doesn&#x27;t really get suds at all, which I was slightly disappointed in bc it made it hard to really work in. And the shampoo and conditioner were smaller than I expected but work great. The serum is my favorite, takes my frizz and gives it shine and calms it to a smooth silk. The styling spray is a light hold but enough to do the job and smells wonderful. Will def be a continuing customer.</li>
    <li> I habe thick course curly naturally dry hair and this actually puts moisture and softness in it!</li>
    <li> I give a 4 star because my style spray top was not on the right way and spilled a little. I didn&#x27;t loose a lot of solution thankfully but it&#x27;s important that things don&#x27;t spill when shipping. I also give it a 4 because the shipping was fast!! Got it the same week I order it. The products are and feel healthy for my hair. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this line. Except the hair spray....it has no hold to it at all. I mainly got it for the serum. ..the serum is nice and lightweight for my fine hair and it smells amazing. Also love the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> i like the shampoo and serum,but the hair spray doesnt work for me .i used it after i styled my hair to keep the style ,instead it made it frizzy  again.i have thick curly frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my wife she loved it. Smells really good and makes her hair shine. I will be ordering this regularly.</li>
    <li> Does not live up to expectation.</li>
    <li> I bought tjis because I really loved the serum due the softness and smell that leaves on my hair. Hence, this bundle was not my fave and regret buying it. The shampoo,conditioner and hair spray smell extremely bad and the size of the shampoo and conditioner was very small.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but I just wish the smell would stay in my hair longer, other than that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
