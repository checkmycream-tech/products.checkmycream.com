      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know of anyone else having this problem though, and it is not something that would make me stop using the product because I love it.</li>
      <li>This is definitely my favorite skin care line.</li>
      <li>and my skin seems to recover so much better than it used to.  </li>
      <li>I love the mini granules in it that also help exfoliate your skin.  </li>
      <li>better results.</li>
      <li>and I love both of them as well.  </li>
      <li>No drying out one bit:)</li>
      <li>After trying this cleanser my skin feels and looks better.  </li>
      <li>I use the mild rice cleanser and after going through many products this is by far one of the best.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and smells great and looks rested.  </li>
      <li>The first time that I used this product, I noticed a mild tingling that was sort of pleasant.</li>
      <li>I tried Blissoma Fresh Mild Rice Cleanser and absolutely loved how it gave my face a refreshing and cool feeling.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care if I sound like a commercial or not, this stuff is incredible.  </li>
      <li>It applies easily and rinses well.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>There were some really awesome natural products of all kinds in my surprise package but this was by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>This is the only thing that kept my hormonal acne under control and cleared up my skin beautifully.</li>
      <li>I love this mild rice cleanser.</li>
      <li>But even better is how it feels on my skin as I wash my face with the mild exfoliation from the brown rice</li>
      <li>However, I am a HUGE product junkie and, for whatever reason, decided to try Peter Thomas Roth anti-aging cleansing gel when my blissoma ran out  </li>
      <li>Although there are cheaper options out there, I&#x27;ve been so pleased with Blissoma&#x27;s performance that I think it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Then I won a full set of Blissoma products (cleanser, smooth serum, toner, clay masque) in a blog giveaway and gave them a shot.</li>
      <li>it still felt clean and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>did not feel thoroughly clean</li>
      <li>The cleanser and the smooth serum are my two favorite Blissoma products, and as long as I have both, my skin plays nice.</li>
      <li>It smells great and has a nice consistency with subtle grains that exfoliate a bit.</li>
      <li>At first the color and texture might make you think twice, but once you use it and see how great your skin feels, you&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
      <li>The company provided a full refund.    </li>
      <li>THis is a must buy product, it has a nice clean fresh scent and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and soft!</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing and it left my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>I look forward to using this cleanser every morning &amp; night, especially because I know that it is all natural and good for my skin!</li>
      <li>Eminence is great also, but Blissoma has them both beat, hands down.</li>
      <li>after using fresh mild rice cleaner on my face</li>
      <li>Also, it smells nice, which is a definite plus.</li>
      <li>It is fresh and without all the chemicals that we don&#x27;t need on our skin.</li>
      <li>and I love that it is made from natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I love the list of ingredients that they use in all their products and can&#x27;t wait to get my complete set.</li>
      <li>Blissoma&#x27;s cleanser rinses quite cleanly and leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight.</li>
      <li>I have easily irritated, dry/T-zone mature skin and</li>
      <li>The mild rice (or I&#x27;ve also found before that oatmeal helps my skin too) cleaned but was gentle too.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this, my skin loved it, it didnt feel stripped or tight</li>
      <li>Since winning that giveaway, I&#x27;ve gone back to purchase Blissoma products a couple times.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It is not harsh on my skin, does not clog my pores, smells fantastic, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam much, but the texture is pleasant and provides just a little exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had difficulty finding a good cleanser that really cleaned my skin without leaving it feeling like a brittle flakey mess.</li>
      <li>But Blissoma Fresh Mild Rice Cleanser is so gentle on my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild and fresh and so gentle that even a sensitive skin person like me can use it without worry.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!  </li>
      <li>With Blissoma&#x27;s mild rice cleanser and smooth serum, my skin rarely breaks out and seems to be much happier than it has been with any other line.    </li>
      <li>It is soft and hydrated and NOT dry like most cleansers make my face feel.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would work for me.  </li>
      <li>Nothing made much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I also use the Smooth A+ Moisture Serum and the Adaptive Energy Tonique facial toner mist</li>
      <li>I was using an acne/blackhead cleanser that was made by a company whom I thought was gentle too.  </li>
      <li>i really felt a differance.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>She told me that the cleanser was actually leaving a film on top of my skin that was preventing it from naturally letting dirt out of the pores, therefore clogging them and creating whiteheads and what-have-you.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with this product from the little sample I received and am now trying the whole line.</li>
      <li>In addition, I was also told to drink less milk (sugars in it contributed to my skin issues) and to eat more greens.   </li>
      <li>The second time that I used this product, my face felt a mild burn.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t apparent from looking at me, but under the magnifying light it was apparent.  </li>
      <li>There were no overnight miracles, but rather a steady, noticeable improvement in how my skin looked and behaved.</li>
      <li>I have very problematic skin and its very sensitive</li>
      <li>I love that it has little pieces of rice in it</li>
      <li>(should of just ordered a 2nd blissoma bottle right away)...</li>

    <li> I tried Blissoma Fresh Mild Rice Cleanser and absolutely loved how it gave my face a refreshing and cool feeling.  I look forward to using this cleanser every morning &amp; night, especially because I know that it is all natural and good for my skin!</li>

    <li> I received a sample of this product as a promotion from Eco-Emi in their monthly surprise package. There were some really awesome natural products of all kinds in my surprise package but this was by far my favorite. It is made of amazing ingredients and it smells delicious. I detected a slight grapefruit-y smell, but don&#x27;t see it in the list of ingredients, some other citrus though. But even better is how it feels on my skin as I wash my face with the mild exfoliation from the brown rice and then how my skin feels after I&#x27;m done. It is soft and hydrated and NOT dry like most cleansers make my face feel. I fell in love with this product from the little sample I received and am now trying the whole line. I love the list of ingredients that they use in all their products and can&#x27;t wait to get my complete set.</li>

    <li> after using fresh mild rice cleaner on my face i really felt a differance. my skin felt smoother and softer and i love the way it cleans great product</li>
    <li> After using this cleanser (and the A+ Moisture serum) religiously for the last few months I finally have the skin I&#x27;ve always wanted.  Soft, smooth, plump, and happy!!!  The little bumps that used to riddle my forhead are GONE! If I happen to get a tiny blemish it dissapears within a day and my skin seems to recover so much better than it used to.  I am now a faithful follower of Blissoma and am so pleased and thankful that I found these wonderful, quality products!</li>
    <li> I have always had dry skin and have a hard time finding a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. THis is a must buy product, it has a nice clean fresh scent and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and soft! No drying out one bit:)</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this cleanser!! I have rosacea and frequent breakouts and have tried every product, natural and conventional, and this is the only product to make a noticable difference almost immediately! The smell is amazing, like a spa treatment! I am very happy with this product amd am looking forward to trying more!</li>
    <li> Thanks! Fast delivery. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, all-natural cleanser that has saved my acne-prone skin (along with their moisturizers). It smells great and has a nice consistency with subtle grains that exfoliate a bit. I&#x27;m not sure how it is at getting makeup off though, since I always take off makeup first with grapeseed oil, and then wash with the mild rice cleanser.    The ONLY problem I have with this is that this is the third bottle I&#x27;ve bought that either got clogged or broken halfway through and the product wouldn&#x27;t come out anymore, so I had to take off the top and dump it into my hand. I don&#x27;t know of anyone else having this problem though, and it is not something that would make me stop using the product because I love it.</li>
    <li> I use the mild rice cleanser and after going through many products this is by far one of the best.  It is fresh and without all the chemicals that we don&#x27;t need on our skin. I love the mini granules in it that also help exfoliate your skin.  I also use the day and night cream and the clay mask. They are all really great. My skin is bright and not dull at all after using these products even in the cold winter months.  They have great customer service as well and my products are delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble buying cleansers because they always leave feeling dry and tight. But Blissoma Fresh Mild Rice Cleanser is so gentle on my sensitive skin! It rinses clean and won&#x27;t strip my skin leaving it tight afterward. Definitely get this if you need a cleanser that works!</li>
    <li> I tried this once, it was a gift from a friend. I like the way it cleans and smells.  works on me!</li>
    <li> After trying this cleanser my skin feels and looks better.  I have sensitive skin so sometimes it can be hard to find a product that will be gentle enough to use.  This cleanser smells great and I love that it is made from natural ingredients.  I also use the Smooth A+ Moisture Serum and the Adaptive Energy Tonique facial toner mist and I love both of them as well.  My order arrived in a timely fashion and I will definitely continue to purchase these products (and hopefully others) in the future.  This is definitely my favorite skin care line.</li>
    <li> I love this mild rice cleanser. The smell is amazing and it left my skin feeling clean and smooth. Did not irritate my roseacea.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin sensitive skin with hormonal acne...aka a complete mess!! The first time I used this, my skin loved it, it didnt feel stripped or tight it still felt clean and moisturized.  This is the only thing that kept my hormonal acne under control and cleared up my skin beautifully. However, I am a HUGE product junkie and, for whatever reason, decided to try Peter Thomas Roth anti-aging cleansing gel when my blissoma ran out  (should of just ordered a 2nd blissoma bottle right away)...well, it dumbest thing I have ever did!!!! I used PTR for about two weeks and had one of the worst breakouts ever, I ended up returning it to Sephora right away.  I am still trying to get my skin back on track from that huge set back... and Blissoma cleanser is my HG... like the old saying &amp;#34;dont try to fix things that aren&#x27;t broke!&amp;#34;... lesson learned the hard way!</li>
    <li> I tried the Blissoma Fresh Mild Rice Cleaner for the first time this past month - and I am hooked!    I am not a HUGE fan of the smell (as it&#x27;s quite strong), but the effectiveness of the product and the quality brings me back daily.  It applies easily and rinses well.  My skin is left feeling soft (not dried out like other cleansers) and non greasy.    I have VERY sensitive skin, and the product has been gentle enough for me to use twice daily without any ill effects.  Combined with their toner and moisturizer, my skin looks amazing.    I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Blissoma mild rice cleanser is simply amazing!!  It is not harsh on my skin, does not clog my pores, smells fantastic, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I started using it after a recommendation from my cosmetologist.  I had a facial because my skin is so sensitive and every type of face wash I tried would trigger something, whether it be dry skin, acne, or redness.  I was using an acne/blackhead cleanser that was made by a company whom I thought was gentle too.  She told me that the cleanser was actually leaving a film on top of my skin that was preventing it from naturally letting dirt out of the pores, therefore clogging them and creating whiteheads and what-have-you.  It wasn&#x27;t apparent from looking at me, but under the magnifying light it was apparent.  In addition, I was also told to drink less milk (sugars in it contributed to my skin issues) and to eat more greens.   However, now I find it more difficult to find in any stores to purchase.  Please tell me where I can find it, besides online of course.</li>
    <li> This smells like a dream, as all their products do. I have rationed Dr. Hauschka products because they smell and feel so great, but the price would just kill me. Eminence is great also, but Blissoma has them both beat, hands down.</li>
    <li> Over the past ten years, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my troubled skin that likes to first break out and then scar. I first went through the conventional lines, then dabbled in a variety of natural ones. Nothing made much of a difference. By the end, I was extremely skeptical about skincare claims and inflated prices. Then I won a full set of Blissoma products (cleanser, smooth serum, toner, clay masque) in a blog giveaway and gave them a shot. There were no overnight miracles, but rather a steady, noticeable improvement in how my skin looked and behaved. With Blissoma&#x27;s mild rice cleanser and smooth serum, my skin rarely breaks out and seems to be much happier than it has been with any other line.    The cleanser smells lemony bright and the ingredients list is impressively free of chemicals. It doesn&#x27;t foam much, but the texture is pleasant and provides just a little exfoliation. Most of the cleansers I&#x27;ve tried either strip my skin (e.g. the castille soap based cleansers) or leave a coat of oil behind. Blissoma&#x27;s cleanser rinses quite cleanly and leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight. The cleanser and the smooth serum are my two favorite Blissoma products, and as long as I have both, my skin plays nice. A 4 oz bottle lasts me several months.    Since winning that giveaway, I&#x27;ve gone back to purchase Blissoma products a couple times. Whenever I try a different brand, even for a short period of time, my skin goes back to being problematic, so I think I&#x27;m done shopping around for skincare. Although there are cheaper options out there, I&#x27;ve been so pleased with Blissoma&#x27;s performance that I think it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, EVERYTHING, and keep coming back to this cleanser. The smell alone is enough to make you want to use it forever.  It&#x27;s mild and fresh and so gentle that even a sensitive skin person like me can use it without worry. I go back and forth between this and something a little stronger to slough off dead skin cells.  But I have this with me everywhere I travel....it&#x27;s a great product from a truly fantastic company.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and still love it. My skin feels soft and smells great and looks rested.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, washes off easily.  At first the color and texture might make you think twice, but once you use it and see how great your skin feels, you&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
    <li> This product smells great...my 6 year old daughter thought it smells like Fruit Loops! I have really sensitive skin so I&#x27;m searching for a product that is non-toxic, good for the enviroment and works. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a month, but it seems to be working well. I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if it can improve my skin texture even more than it already has.</li>
    <li> The first time that I used this product, I noticed a mild tingling that was sort of pleasant. The second time that I used this product, my face felt a mild burn. Even after I thoroughly rinsed the product off, my skin still felt a little irritated. I stopped using this cleanser, but continued to use the Peace lotion (same line) in hopes that that would work out, but it didn&#x27;t (see review). The company provided a full refund.    Still a nice product...I am probably just sensitive to one of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had difficulty finding a good cleanser that really cleaned my skin without leaving it feeling like a brittle flakey mess. It&#x27;s always been a bit of a conundrum as I like the feeling of scrubby beads in my cleansers, so that I really FEEL the cleaning, but those are the types of cleanseres that seem to be worst for sensitive skin. This cleanser, however, still manages to make you feel clean without the harshness that comes with other brands. Also, it smells nice, which is a definite plus. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. I asked for more for Christmas from the hubbie! [:</li>
    <li> I have never been happier with a facial line, then this one.  On a whim, I decided to try this stuff.  Everything I have purchased from Blissoma Solutions, is AMAZING!  My skin looks and feels younger.  I don&#x27;t care if I sound like a commercial or not, this stuff is incredible.  Thanks so much!  I now have a skin care program I love, and WILL buy always!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is marvelous, and smells incredible. I love that it has little pieces of rice in it and it is never too harsh on my normal to dry skin. I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work for me.  Unfortunately I noticed my skin broke out right after using.  Tried it daily for 2 weeks and the breakout never went away.  As soon as I stopped using it, my skin cleared up.  I have very problematic skin and its very sensitive so I&#x27;m always looking for all natural products.  This just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> I got this after learning that foaming cleansers can strip the acid mantle, cause acne, etc. ...but I am not pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;smells good&lt;br /&gt;all natural&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t strip skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;pump stopped working after 2 uses...poor packaging&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t clear up skin or improve it at all&lt;br /&gt;skin did not feel thoroughly clean&lt;br /&gt;outrageous price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to stick to drugstore products &amp; a dermatologist...better results.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy it if your skin is sensitive. it makes your skin incredibly dry and thin. it&#x27;ll ruin your face!</li>
