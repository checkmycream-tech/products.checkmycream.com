      <li>Love this stuff, been using it for years, I get compliments all the time on my skin, I am over 60.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more for a once or twice a week &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed that my makeup is holding up better.</li>
      <li>Love this cream.</li>
      <li>so be sure to get it off amazon for $30.</li>

      <li>If you don&#x27;t like it, or it doesn&#x27;t agree with your skin, you can easily return it for a full refund.  </li>
      <li>After about 4 nights, I could see a significant difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
      <li>Really good if you&#x27;re looking for solid moisture plus anti-aging properties.</li>
      <li>Despite it being a night cream, it was light, non-greasy and absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>I think Oil of Olay offers products just as good as Clinique at much lower prices.  </li>
      <li>This product is excellent for African American women.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and has no odor</li>
      <li>but then I ran out of my normal night cream and thought I&#x27;d use this sample until I could get some more.</li>
      <li>It really is a good product, but it is way too much for my combination skin; I think that this might probably best for dry skin only, as I wake up in the morning feeling all greasy after putting this on the night before, and I have drier skin and barely oily in my T zone.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is very light and creamy and it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply to my whole face.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I have really noticed a significant difference in my skin since I started using this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soothing, moisturizes just right, and leaves my face feeling just...</li>
      <li>The overnight radiance give just the right amount of moisture and rejuvenates the skin.  </li>
      <li>How it manages to look after my drier areas and my more &#x27;oilier&#x27; areas at the same time, is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;Every</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>so I really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
      <li>Anyway, I got this moisturizer in a recent free gift with purchase (I swear by their 24-hr Pretty water-resistant mascara).</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It really does leave my skin with a bit of a glow.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>no box, and does not look real</li>
      <li>This product really does help with moisturizing your skin.  </li>
      <li>It evens out pigmentation and melanin caused spotiness and discoloration FAST.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me except make my face break out.</li>
      <li>My goodness this does live up to the hype.  </li>
      <li>My face so so soft.</li>
      <li>This cream polishes my skin -- makes it soft and glowing.  </li>
      <li>Then after 2 or 3 more nights, those horrible deep wrinkles on my upper lip from smoking when I was younger, dumber and more concerned with fitting in were almost gone.</li>
      <li>came without the box and withouy instruction sheet so wondering if real clinique product or someone just filled container with random face cream</li>
      <li>Not oily, not dry, just like it should feel.  </li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way and it is worth every cent I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>Have been using 4 two weeks skin still very dry a lot of money to spend without results,but at least fregrance free</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and found it here &amp; it was cheaper and of course with prime 2 day free shipping! I&#x27;m 54 and just started to notice a little bit of crows feet I swear by this product!!!! love love love it !</li>
    <li> I was not a fan. Did not moisturize as expected.  Woke up with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 25 years and still find it very beneficial for keeping my skin bright and even toned.</li>
    <li> no box, and does not look real</li>
    <li> This product really does help with moisturizing your skin.  I live in Minnesota, so battling dry, cold air is a constant endeavor.  Do I think it will remove wrinkles...no.  Do I think it makes my skin look much more radiant, yes!  This product is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> O yes!  My face so so soft.</li>
    <li> Great! Fast delivery. Packaging was excellent, clean, neat, secure.&lt;br /&gt;This is what I look for in an order.  This is where I will continue to purchase my Clinique products.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This cream polishes my skin -- makes it soft and glowing.  Best ever.</li>
    <li> Love this product, so sorry Clinique has discontinued it!</li>
    <li> came without the box and withouy instruction sheet so wondering if real clinique product or someone just filled container with random face cream</li>
    <li> A beneficial product - great for moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Clinique never disappoints</li>
    <li> Always make your first purchase of expensive skin care from places like Sephora or Ulta.  If you don&#x27;t like it, or it doesn&#x27;t agree with your skin, you can easily return it for a full refund.  If you do like it, repurchase where you can get the best price - usually Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Turnaround line.  I&#x27;ve used the concentrate for years and found it very effective but it&#x27;s more for a once or twice a week &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34;.  The overnight radiance give just the right amount of moisture and rejuvenates the skin.  It really does leave my skin with a bit of a glow.  Very light consistency and feel, no scent, a small amount goes a long way - a container will last me about 4 months.</li>
    <li> I think Oil of Olay offers products just as good as Clinique at much lower prices.  Save your money and try Oil of lay or Aveeno.</li>
    <li> I hate buying expensive beauty products that don&#x27;t work so I do lots of research before buying anything. I&#x27;ve learned this the hard way. I&#x27;m telling you this so you know that I do not have a makeup bag loaded to the gills with Clinique products. Anyway, I got this moisturizer in a recent free gift with purchase (I swear by their 24-hr Pretty water-resistant mascara). It sat on my dresser with other samples for a week or two but then I ran out of my normal night cream and thought I&#x27;d use this sample until I could get some more. I liked it right away. Despite it being a night cream, it was light, non-greasy and absorbed quickly. After about 4 nights, I could see a significant difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. My face looked younger, fresher - dare I say it? Almost dewy. Then after 2 or 3 more nights, those horrible deep wrinkles on my upper lip from smoking when I was younger, dumber and more concerned with fitting in were almost gone. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I have tried at least 4 other creams advertised as deep wrinkle treatments that had no effect whatsoever on those lines. I am definitely buying this and keeping it in my anti-aging arsenal; and I am NOT telling my closest friends. It&#x27;s my turn to look the best in the group...</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to this.  I tried several drugstore brands to try to save money, but they just didn&#x27;t give me the same results.  This stuff is great for my acne-prone skin.  It&#x27;s soothing, moisturizes just right, and leaves my face feeling just...good.  Not oily, not dry, just like it should feel.  In the mornings I can just put my SPF moisturizer on, apply my makeup, and go.  No washing needed.  GREAT stuff!  Really good if you&#x27;re looking for solid moisture plus anti-aging properties.</li>
    <li> After receiving a sample of it in a gift with purchase I was hooked. My skin is so soft and smooth. I have noticed that my makeup is holding up better. I had a problem with my foundation which is also a clinique product (redness solution foundation) flaking a bit as the day went on. Since I started using this moisturizer all over my face I&#x27;m not having that problem anymore. This moisturizer is very light and creamy and it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply to my whole face. Great product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for African American women. The best. It makes my skin.GLOW. It evens out pigmentation and melanin caused spotiness and discoloration FAST.  It like microdermabrasion like effects for black skin.</li>
    <li> Super product and substantially less expensive than department store prices.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, been using it for years, I get compliments all the time on my skin, I am over 60.</li>
    <li> Have used Clinique for years and this is great stuff.  I use it every night.</li>
    <li> good product, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Skin feels amazing after. What a product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Have been using 4 two weeks skin still very dry a lot of money to spend without results,but at least fregrance free</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my newest obsession!  I received a sample and was blown away. $50 is a little pricey so be sure to get it off amazon for $30.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me except make my face break out.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Not greasy, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it actually solve your skin problems overnight? Remove your wrinkles? Give you a post-Photoshop glow? Nope. But nothing does.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Nice and silkly.</li>
    <li> I feel about this Clinique cream just as I do about their other products:  They can&#x27;t be beat! And I only need to use a tiny bit at a time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I have really noticed a significant difference in my skin since I started using this but I can say that my skin isn&#x27;t any worse off for it! It absorbs quickly and has no odor so I really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> Kinda greasy for me. But it does give a glow</li>
    <li> It really is a good product, but it is way too much for my combination skin; I think that this might probably best for dry skin only, as I wake up in the morning feeling all greasy after putting this on the night before, and I have drier skin and barely oily in my T zone.</li>
    <li> Great price for the product. Product changed my skin within a week! Love this product and would recommend for people trying to brighten skin</li>
    <li> My goodness this does live up to the hype.  How it manages to look after my drier areas and my more &#x27;oilier&#x27; areas at the same time, is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;Every moisturiser I&#x27;ve tried has either left me feeling greasy or like I haven&#x27;t applied any at all and dry.  A little bit goes a long way and it is worth every cent I paid for it.  I&#x27;m now living in fear they will discontinue this product.</li>
