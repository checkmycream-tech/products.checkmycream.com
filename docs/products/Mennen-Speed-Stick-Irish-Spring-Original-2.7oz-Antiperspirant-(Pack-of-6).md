      <li>I will be ordering more when I need more</li>
      <li>Smells just like the soap which I love.</li>
      <li>So, now, before I buy any deodorant I make sure there isn&#x27;t this ingredient in it.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find some here at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>husband &amp; son are satisfied</li>
      <li>try it you will love it</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s much better than the alternative.  </li>
      <li>Buying it online in a pack of 6 is more convenient than making trips to the supermarket.</li>
      <li>my favorite deodorant among the rest</li>
      <li>He was very excited to see that I found it for him..</li>
      <li>Pretty good quality/price</li>
      <li>Keeps you dry and the smell is awesome.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price for good product.  </li>
      <li>The smell is too strong for me to recommend it.</li>
      <li>and it has a strong scent as well.</li>
      <li>Very longlasting (it all day long) and good antiperspirant, and it has nice smell and good size.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and the fresh, clean smell lasts all day.</li>
      <li>fine cause</li>
      <li>Same thing as in the stores, works great.</li>
      <li>This is the greatest antiperspirant and really the only one that truly works with me.  </li>
      <li>And, although the research is sketchy, I surmise that a good day must start with Irish Spring....</li>
      <li>This has a very crisp, clean scent that I&#x27;ve always loved about Irish Spring soap.</li>
      <li>Luckily I found it on Amazon and Quickly ordered it.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend started to notice that i was smelling a lot better and highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>Keeps me smelling fresh a full 8+ hours at work.</li>
      <li>By mid-morning on a hot day, early afternoon on a warm one I was dripping.  </li>
      <li>The only choices nowadays for deodorant are ones that smell like cheap cologne and very cheap cologne.</li>
      <li>Leaves me smelling minty fresh.</li>
      <li>I smell fresh all day using this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I love the old style Speedstick antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>This item arrived today earlier than the expected date which is awesome.</li>
      <li>The six pack is amazing buy and means that I won&#x27;t have to purchase more for him for at least another six months.</li>
      <li>I give it four stars because even though it works well, and has, for me, an attractive smell, one package doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as you think it&#x27;s going to.</li>
      <li>Product exactly as thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>This is basically like rubbing a bar of Irish Spring soap under your armpits, I love it and will be ordering again, please don&#x27;t discontinue online.</li>
      <li>Very well worth it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Irish Spring.  </li>
      <li>On the contrary, the old stand by Speed Stick is readily available in bulk at a reasonable price right here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but mine has been nothing but positive.</li>
      <li>and i smell fresh and clean just like right  out of a bath all day long</li>
      <li>This is one of the only antiperspirant/deodorants that I can use without the skin in my armpits becoming irritated.</li>
      <li>When we studied closer we discovered one ingredient that may be responsible for this allergy - Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly.</li>
      <li>So shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>This deodorant last for the whole day and leaves you smelling fresh and clean as if you just left the shower.</li>
      <li>Most local stores are either out or no longer carrying this specific item.</li>
      <li>I had to switch from original Old Spice blue gel deodorant b/c</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the little things :-)</li>
      <li>First I thought is was going to be a gel but its the white bar, it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>The Irish Spring scent is hard to find in the drugstores, so I was thrilled when I found it on amazon.  </li>
      <li>Love the fragrance and it lasts all day long even in high heat, heavy sweating.  </li>
      <li>and it lasts pretty long too, unless you work in a kitchen during a heat wave</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, like many other products, the size of the package doesn&#x27;t accurately indicate how much product you&#x27;re getting.</li>
      <li>When he switched back to the normal Speed Stick which didn&#x27;t contain this ingredient, - all the allergy reactions stopped!</li>
      <li>it goes on clear &amp;it smells like Irish Spring....</li>
      <li>but its the white one not green and leaves residue on all his shirts.</li>
      <li>My lady loves the scent and  love the freshness, used this for years and it never gets old or stale</li>

<li> I smell like shower all day long.  </li>
<li> The expected delivery date was supposed to be tomorrow, but got it a day earlier.</li>

<li> Unfortunately you have to Really Like the smell of Irish Spring for this to work.</li>
<li> Instead of running out every other week or so and having to go to the drug store, I can sit at home and pay less than 3 bucks per stick and not think about it for 6 times as long.</li>
<li> i buy in bulk because things that I like and work well are typically discontinued.....</li>
<li> I tried a few different Old Spice alternatives, as I&#x27;ve been a fan since my grandfather introduced me to their cologne, but they are expensive and hard to get in bulk.  </li>
<li> Buy a 6 pack and forget about it for a few months.</li>
<li> , however, don&#x27;t mind the smell which others disliked.</li>
<li> super disappointed</li>
<li> product does not last when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I have not smelled any Body Odor from Speed Stick in the past and while on vacation I smelled very badly for the first time in years.&lt;br</li>
<li> Not sure why people change the recipe of things like this, but bottom line, it&#x27;s no longer good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I was sad to see that none of the stores around the area were carrying the Irish Spring Speed Stick deodorant.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used Irish Spring for over 25 years. To say the least, its scent is a staple to my day. And, although the research is sketchy, I surmise that a good day must start with Irish Spring....it simply must. Needless to say, to now have the scent in an all-day deodorant puts all odds in your favor. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never found this in a local store.</li>
    <li> First I thought is was going to be a gel but its the white bar, it&#x27;s fine cause it goes on clear &amp;it smells like Irish Spring....I will be ordering more when I need more</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.</li>
    <li> Very longlasting (it all day long) and good antiperspirant, and it has nice smell and good size. Pretty good quality/price</li>
    <li> Keeps me smelling fresh a full 8+ hours at work.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s deodorant... Good price for a great scent and it lasts pretty long too, unless you work in a kitchen during a heat wave, found that one out the hard way, would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> My lady loves the scent and  love the freshness, used this for years and it never gets old or stale</li>
    <li> Leaves me smelling minty fresh.</li>
    <li> husband &amp; son are satisfied</li>
    <li> Wearing this for years. Great product. Great Price.</li>
    <li> In case anyone else is wondering this is a white solid, not a clear solid. couldnt find that info anywhere in the description, so thought I would comment on it.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my boyfriend and they smell awesome. The six pack is amazing buy and means that I won&#x27;t have to purchase more for him for at least another six months. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> These are the best ever. Keep me from smelling during a really long work day</li>
    <li> This is the greatest antiperspirant and really the only one that truly works with me.  Very well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome deordorant. Keeps you dry and the smell is awesome. Smells just like the soap which I love.</li>
    <li> I love the old style Speedstick antiperspirant. I was happy to find some here at a reasonable price. It can be hard to find in stores. Unfortunately you have to Really Like the smell of Irish Spring for this to work. The smell is too strong for me to recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only antiperspirant/deodorants that I can use without the skin in my armpits becoming irritated. Buying it online in a pack of 6 is more convenient than making trips to the supermarket. Unfortunately, like many other products, the size of the package doesn&#x27;t accurately indicate how much product you&#x27;re getting. I give it four stars because even though it works well, and has, for me, an attractive smell, one package doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as you think it&#x27;s going to.</li>
    <li> I agree with others.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not last when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I have not smelled any Body Odor from Speed Stick in the past and while on vacation I smelled very badly for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;It can only be one thing - my deodorant.  Not sure why people change the recipe of things like this, but bottom line, it&#x27;s no longer good.&lt;br /&gt;I, however, don&#x27;t mind the smell which others disliked.</li>
    <li> Best speed stick out there!!!</li>
    <li> Nice to not worry about running out. Buy a 6 pack and forget about it for a few months.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the only one I&#x27;ve tried and it actually worked. It smells amazing and the fresh, clean smell lasts all day. I am a woman and have tried all the brands out there but none compare to this one!</li>
    <li> Great but one of them wouldnt come out</li>
    <li> Irritated and couldn&#x27;t get used to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find this deodorant for 3 years since all my local stores discontinued it, seems like that happens with all the products I like for some reason. The only choices nowadays for deodorant are ones that smell like cheap cologne and very cheap cologne. This has a very crisp, clean scent that I&#x27;ve always loved about Irish Spring soap. This is basically like rubbing a bar of Irish Spring soap under your armpits, I love it and will be ordering again, please don&#x27;t discontinue online.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend can not find this deodorant in stores anywhere.. He was very excited to see that I found it for him.. It&#x27;s the little things :-)</li>
    <li> Could not find in stores, my father loves this product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Irish Spring.  I smell fresh all day using this deodorant.  I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Good product and smells good too.</li>
    <li> Great deal you can no longer find in stores</li>
    <li> This is the only way to buy it.  Have plenty for different locations, or just enough to last a year.  i buy in bulk because things that I like and work well are typically discontinued.....</li>
    <li> Product exactly as thought it would be.  Reasonable price for good product.  Happy with results and will re-order when needed.</li>
    <li> My wife and I each have a Speed Stick in our morning grooming kit. I have a serious sweat problem in the Summer. This stuff takes care of it and I stay dry all day. Good choice.</li>
    <li> Its a good deodorant. Smells nice, works for what its supposed to do. I don&#x27;t need anything fancy and expensive. Its cheaper and easier to buy this in bulk. Instead of running out every other week or so and having to go to the drug store, I can sit at home and pay less than 3 bucks per stick and not think about it for 6 times as long.</li>
    <li> I had to switch from original Old Spice blue gel deodorant b/c it just wasn&#x27;t getting the job done.  By mid-morning on a hot day, early afternoon on a warm one I was dripping.  I tried a few different Old Spice alternatives, as I&#x27;ve been a fan since my grandfather introduced me to their cologne, but they are expensive and hard to get in bulk.  On the contrary, the old stand by Speed Stick is readily available in bulk at a reasonable price right here on Amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, flake, etc. and it keeps me dry and smells just like my soap!</li>
    <li> Product arrrived in a timely manner and was at a good price.  I have tried to get this specific antiperspirant as it is the only one i have found that does not make me break out.  Most local stores are either out or no longer carrying this specific item.</li>
    <li> Same thing as in the stores, works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant for my husband and he got allergic reaction to it. He uses Speed Stick deodorants all the time, but there was something different with this one. When we studied closer we discovered one ingredient that may be responsible for this allergy - Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly. When he switched back to the normal Speed Stick which didn&#x27;t contain this ingredient, - all the allergy reactions stopped! So, now, before I buy any deodorant I make sure there isn&#x27;t this ingredient in it. Hope this info helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. By the way, I got refunded when I returned it back to the seller (of course, I explained to why I want to return it). They were nice about it, and covered even shipping cost for me!</li>
    <li> The best antiperspirant on the market, in my opinion.  The Irish Spring scent is hard to find in the drugstores, so I was thrilled when I found it on amazon.  I get it in the 6 pak for the best deal.  Thank you amazon for carrying the best of everything!!</li>
    <li> my favorite deodorant among the rest it stop me from sweating like a horse and i smell fresh and clean just like right  out of a bath all day long try it you will love it aloha da smell good guy</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant and we couldnt find it anyway so grabbed this 6 pack...but its the white one not green and leaves residue on all his shirts. super disappointed</li>
    <li> I have tried countless of products seeing if they would help with my body odor. I was sad to see that none of the stores around the area were carrying the Irish Spring Speed Stick deodorant. Luckily I found it on Amazon and Quickly ordered it. This deodorant last for the whole day and leaves you smelling fresh and clean as if you just left the shower. My girlfriend started to notice that i was smelling a lot better and highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> My favorite of all time! Just a heads up regarding price - it&#x27;s currently cheaper per stick at CVS!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and it lasts all day long even in high heat, heavy sweating.  My only complaint is the white residue under your armpits on undershirts.</li>
    <li> This item arrived today earlier than the expected date which is awesome. The expected delivery date was supposed to be tomorrow, but got it a day earlier. So shipping was fast. So far the scent is incredible. I have been wearing it since I got it and it has a strong scent as well. I just hope it lasts me through the day so I can feel refreshed and good.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I smell like shower all day long.  And that&#x27;s much better than the alternative.  My wife doesn&#x27;t like to smell like man, so she has to buy her own now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deodarant that keeps you dry. Everyones body is different and may have a different experience with speed stick but mine has been nothing but positive. It does not leave white clumps or flakes either.</li>
