<li> Seems to not cut as sharp and tends to scratch/scrape as you go. :(</li>
<li> Then when I turn on the razor, the piece of crap head pops off.</li>
<li> plenty of power to rip through that nasty stuff.</li>

    <li> Great product. I highly recommend it for those guys that have the &amp;#34;Cave Man&amp;#34; back like me.</li>
    <li> The new blade works great and just takes a few minutes to put on.  I will buy again when this one gets old after a few months.</li>
    <li> Pretty much if you have hair you do not want, any way you choose to remove them are unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;This works ok. Does leave marks. Make sure you replace your razor head after a few sessions of heavy use.&lt;br /&gt;Head gets clogged and requires some cleaning.</li>
    <li> Replacement head for the mangroomer works perfectly.  Had to change out the blade on my mangroomer after a bunch of shaves and this got my Wookiegroomer back in business and mowing down the forest.</li>
    <li> Who likes having a hairy back? Uhhhh... no one! Ordered this replacement razor and it fit perfectly. Now my back is as smooth as a babies bottom. Works for me.</li>
    <li> The clippers fall apart and scratch my back.  Upgrade to the ultimate pro for a better head</li>
    <li> Great product, fits perfectly and works great! Was a little worried it would not fit based on previous reviews but it did!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my clippers. I use them alot so it was about time to get a replacement head. These clipperts cut close without nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer was easy to install, cleans easy and makes the razor act as if its NEW again! Great product.</li>
    <li> You have to make more than one pass to really get it clean, but it isn&#x27;t a big issue.

Fortunately I&#x27;m not a super hairy guy so i don&#x27;t have to do it very often.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> been using the mangroomer for over a year now, works great, but you&#x27;ll need to change the head after a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what the problem is with the head. I never had this problem with the head that came with the unit. When I take the replacement head off, I know how to snap it back on. Then when I turn on the razor, the piece of crap head pops off. I&#x27;ve contacted Mangroomer, I certainly hope they get back to me.</li>
    <li> Easy to get on and off, great price and makes the groomer like new again. Now if it only came with a case, perfection.</li>
    <li> This part went right on, and made my Mangroomer as good as new !!  The original lasted about a year or so !</li>
    <li> According to Mangroomer&#x27;s website this item list for $14.95. This itme is listed on amazon for 20 dollars and a claim of a big discount off list price. NO THANKS</li>
    <li> Husband loves this gift!</li>
    <li> I ordered this replacement head for my Mangroomer. It does not fit. It will pop off, so I cannot use it at all. Was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> holds a charge for some time (I went two weeks) plenty of power to rip through that nasty stuff. Leaves a nice smooth shave I wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> I purchased a rechargeable Mangroomer that worked like a champ. It did everything it was supposed to do. When the head needed to be replaced, I ordered the replacement heads from Amazon. As other reviewers have stated, the new replacement head pops off and it is unusable. I ordered another Mangroomer. I replaced the new head on the new mangroomer and the new replacement head pops off. I thought that perhaps the new replacement head wouldn&#x27;t come off of the new Mangroomer. I think the manufacturer should check the engineering specs and tolerances because what they are selling now is garbage. It does not perform like anything regarded as professional or premium. The Mangroomer is a great product but the replacement heads are pure bunk.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a week . so far so good.I only hope it hold s up. Thank you Louie</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband.  He absolutely loves it!  Saves me from shaving his back!  I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I bought because it was suposed to be premium but,it isnt&#x27; as good as standard.Seems to not cut as sharp and tends to scratch/scrape as you go. :( Disapointed!  Not worth the extra cost,worse than standard.</li>
    <li> did not fit my mangroomer so it was a wasted purchase</li>
    <li> Works great.  Was glad to see replacement heads so I didn&#x27;t have to buy the whole thing again.</li>
    <li> For the past two years I&#x27;ve been using my Mangroomer every 3-4 weeks.  The replacement head I purchased doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the original.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are not sharp.</li>
