      <li>&quot; and I am more prone to breakouts.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>As soon as I miss one day using it, I am able to tell the difference.</li>
      <li>Make sure to wash face before using, and do not put lotion on your face after applying bc that stops it from working and makes your skin breakout.</li>

      <li>Does a great job getting rid of blemishes and is not harsh on the skin.  </li>
      <li>Great mix of natural ingredients.</li>

      <li>This is such an amazing product!</li>
      <li>I first purchased this at target because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and has a pleasant herbaceous scent.</li>
      <li>This is a great little product.  </li>
      <li>The concept is very simple, yet insanely effective.  </li>
      <li>However it didn&#x27;t seem worth the hassles of retuning it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more &#x27;natural&#x27; properties and do I regret it.</li>
      <li>I had battled with warts for so many years, and only this could kill them.</li>
      <li>Sadly I do not know what I COULD recommend...</li>
      <li>; I absolutely adore this product!</li>
      <li>Love to keep this in my travel, train case and sometimes in my purse I carry it especially if its \\&quot;that time of the month\\</li>
      <li>I use it in the morning and night, and it has kept my skin clean and clear!</li>
      <li>A couple years ago I had flat warts all over my face, in clusters and one huge one!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter and prescription treatment available over the coarse of 15 years and finally I have clear beautiful skin after using this product for only two days!</li>
      <li>It helps clear up my face quickly without over drying my skin.</li>
      <li>I even used it for a small fungal rash that my 4 year old had on her face and it worked great...</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t strong enough for someone with a lot of acne.</li>
      <li>but it really works</li>
      <li>It helps with acne but doesn&#x27;t really get rid of much of it.</li>
      <li>I saw absolutely zero progress.</li>
      <li>This really works for treating zits.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I recently switched all of my acne products to Burt&#x27;s Bees and my face has been much more clear.</li>
      <li>I received this 2 pack and one bottle was 1/3 full and the other was 3/4 full because they leaked before I received them.</li>
      <li>This is the best thing ever for cold sores if you catch them early and use it often.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an older person</li>
      <li>I just want to have a somewhat decent face again.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Natural product!!</li>
      <li>The roller ball top allows for even application without overuse of the product (you can&#x27;t waste it if you tried)</li>
      <li>Every day there&#x27;s new ones so even if I do make progress, it is replaced by new ones.</li>
      <li>I need to get a new one...</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin so clear!</li>
      <li>So first I bought this at my local target until the stopped stocking it</li>
      <li>I put this directly on the pimple and the surrounding area</li>
      <li>I use it for myself, and my 13 year old son uses it as well.  </li>
      <li>Have been using this natural product for years.  </li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
      <li>I use when I notice something brewing beneath the surface and often it completely heals before it can become an issue.  </li>
      <li>The smell is strong and it burns a little, but nothing you can&#x27;t handle!</li>
      <li>but the stick gets reused, so by the time the bottle was half full</li>
      <li>No lie, this stuff really works and I will continue to buy it as long as they continue to supply it!</li>
      <li>Especially helpful for sensitive skin that cannot tolerate harsher ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I really hoped an all natural route would help my skin, even just a little, but this is a pipe-dream I am never going to achieve.</li>
      <li>It burned a little the first couple of weeks I used it</li>
      <li>Have been using this whenever needed over the past few years, and find it works wonderfully - as long as you get to your acne early :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff works and I like that it&#x27;s natural. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So first I bought this at my local target until the stopped stocking it so figure I&#x27;ve used it two months now; I absolutely adore this product! I wipe this all over my face twice a day, it&#x27;s gotten rid of my zits and the redness all over! So happy♡ I go through one bottle every week but this is cheaper than anything my dermatologist has ever prescribed and healthier for my skin with no side effects!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! this blemish stick! It&#x27;s amazing! I use it in the morning and night, and it has kept my skin clean and clear! If I feel or see a pimple coming in I put this directly on the pimple and the surrounding area and it&#x27;s gone in the morning! The smell is strong and it burns a little, but nothing you can&#x27;t handle! No lie, this stuff really works and I will continue to buy it as long as they continue to supply it!</li>
    <li> Daughter says &amp;#34;it works!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this product. It helps clear up my face quickly without over drying my skin. (Unless I use it like 10 times a day). But using it where needed 2-3 times a day is enough to get rid of any blemishes within a few days, sometimes even overnight.</li>
    <li> I figured I would try this product due to it&#x27;s more &#x27;natural&#x27; properties and do I regret it. My acne had increased 300% across in applied patches. Where I had only one or two blemishes there are now six+.</li>
    <li> I received this 2 pack and one bottle was 1/3 full and the other was 3/4 full because they leaked before I received them. Needless to say this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> A couple years ago I had flat warts all over my face, in clusters and one huge one! It was so embarrassing! I went to the dermatologist, who wrote me prescription creams and gels. I used so many different kinds and nothing worked, and these creams where so expensive! Almost $100! Finally I had to get rid of them, so I got laser surgery to remove my warts. It left scabs on my face, and when the scabs healed, guess what? The warts where still there! So one day I found this at cvs, and it saved my life! I used it and the warts where gone in less than a week! I had battled with warts for so many years, and only this could kill them. If you struggle with embarrassing blemishes get this! Make sure to wash face before using, and do not put lotion on your face after applying bc that stops it from working and makes your skin breakout. This is what stopped my warts! And also praying!!</li>
    <li> It burned a little the first couple of weeks I used it but it quit burning after that. It helps with acne but doesn&#x27;t really get rid of much of it. I did notice though, that it kept my acne from getting worse. I think this product would be best for someone with very little acne or someone who gets pimples every now and then. For someone with a lot of acne I would suggest getting something a lot stronger than this. This product isn&#x27;t strong enough for someone with a lot of acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with minor acne that never went away no matter how well I cared for my skin. I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter and prescription treatment available over the coarse of 15 years and finally I have clear beautiful skin after using this product for only two days!</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product! I have used for about a week, and almost all my blemishes are gone!!! I need to get a new one...these little tunes last SO long!! Thank you Burts Bees!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this at target because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. Of course, most things are found cheaper on Amazon! I bought two packs of these (so I am getting 4 total). If you feel a pimple coming up, just roll some of this over it and within a day the bump goes down! I recently switched all of my acne products to Burt&#x27;s Bees and my face has been much more clear. Natural product!!</li>
    <li> Great smell and excellent results! Even my husband swears by this product when he feels a zit coming on. Gets rid of those irritating bumps within hours and this stick lasts a long time. The roller ball top allows for even application without overuse of the product (you can&#x27;t waste it if you tried) Love to keep this in my travel, train case and sometimes in my purse I carry it especially if its \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot; and I am more prone to breakouts. Works even under makeup!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great little product.  The concept is very simple, yet insanely effective.  When I see a blemish, all that needs to be done is roll a bit of the stick on, and continue on with my day.</li>
    <li> This really works for treating zits. When ever I see redness and feel it begin to swell, I would dab this on overnight. And the swelling would usually go down the next morning. Life saver!</li>
    <li> Have been using this natural product for years.  I don&#x27;t have acne, but experience hormonal breakouts.  This product is excellent - I use when I notice something brewing beneath the surface and often it completely heals before it can become an issue.  Also use on insect bites.  My husband now uses it too.  Especially helpful for sensitive skin that cannot tolerate harsher ingredients.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find it on auto-ship. It keeps my skin so clear! As soon as I miss one day using it, I am able to tell the difference.</li>
    <li> 3 stars for the product, which I know and like. The packaging left something to be desired in that one of the bottles was already 25% empty when it arrived. However it didn&#x27;t seem worth the hassles of retuning it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having horrible acne for the last two years. I&#x27;ve tried everything...I&#x27;m on a gluten free dairy free diet, make sure to eat plenty of healthy foods, exercise, and this whole time have seen a dermatologist. I&#x27;m on birth control and my dermatologist has had me try every product under the sun, including antibiotics, as well as I&#x27;ve tried OTC products in my own time. I exfoliate only twice a week and cleanse only twice a day. I only use cleansers on my affected skin, not regular soap, as instructed by my doctor. I saw that this stick had raving reviews and thought I could attempt it since I am at my wit&#x27;s end. I have cystic acne all over my face. Every day there&#x27;s new ones so even if I do make progress, it is replaced by new ones. I feel disgusting, ugly, unclean. I just started having these issues a couple years ago and I am turning 23 tomorrow...I feel awful. I just want to have a somewhat decent face again. It&#x27;s to the point i can hardly tell the difference between my acne, acne scars, and the actual normal moles I&#x27;ve always had on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyway to the review...I give this one star. I saw absolutely zero progress. It stung horribly and did nothing. I gave it a couple weeks, no results. Not just that but the stick gets reused, so by the time the bottle was half full I noticed that some of the bacteria gets back inside the bottle, ew!!! I really hoped an all natural route would help my skin, even just a little, but this is a pipe-dream I am never going to achieve. I suppose it might work if you have hardly any blemishes ever but if you have ACNE all the time I would not recommend it . Sadly I do not know what I COULD recommend...</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> I have stubborn, cystic acne. I&#x27;ve been through rounds of antibiotics, topical face creams, Proactiv.....just about everything sans the scary Accutane. Being near 30, having such annoying acne is frustrating, but I&#x27;ve been able to get it mostly under control with birth control, Differin, and clindamycin. While I&#x27;d prefer to be on all-natural products, they just don&#x27;t work for me.....except this blemish stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that the results are immediate by any means, but when I feel a cyst under my skin (or have a big blemish already appearing), I immediately attack it with this blemish stick. After using it twice a day, after a couple of days, the acne definitely is reduced in size and angry-ness. Someone with less aggressive acne could probably get by using just this...but if you have tough acne like me, you might feel comforted to know that while it won&#x27;t solve all your problems, it might actually help in addition to whatever else you use. I&#x27;ve kept a constant supply as a spot treatment and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for blemishes and minor cuts.</li>
    <li> Have been using this whenever needed over the past few years, and find it works wonderfully - as long as you get to your acne early :) It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and has a pleasant herbaceous scent. Definitely helps keep my skin clear without being too harsh.</li>
    <li> Does a great job getting rid of blemishes and is not harsh on the skin.  I use it for myself, and my 13 year old son uses it as well.  I even used it for a small fungal rash that my 4 year old had on her face and it worked great...didn&#x27;t have to bother with a prescription.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever for cold sores if you catch them early and use it often.  Reduces severity, length of outbreak, and healing time.</li>
    <li> Great mix of natural ingredients. Easy on your skin while helping get rid of your acne problem. I always keep a stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an older person and I use this every day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and doesn&#x27;t smell too strongly of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> really works good.  my grandchildren demand I get it for them. the blemish&lt;br /&gt;stick works so good, it is hard to imagine. but it really works</li>
</ol>
