### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is the best</li>
      <li>but I am perfectly content with this \\&quot;imposter\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>PERFECT PRODUCT</li>
      <li>The Eau De Toilette was one of the best shopping I have done on line QUALITY and PRICE wise.</li>
      <li>This perfume smells very nice.</li>
      <li>I loved the product of great quality would buy again . . . . . . . . . .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved it for years.</li>
      <li>,GOOD FRAGANCE FOR SENIORS</li>
      <li>I was happy to find Cabochard by Grès on Amazon as it was my signature perfume many years ago.  </li>
      <li>She could not find it and was very pleased when I&#x27;ve send it to her.</li>
      <li>This was incredibly unlike the original.</li>
      <li>online &amp; love them both!</li>
      <li>My mother used Channel no5 which I liked</li>
      <li>, Bulgarian rose, clove, oakmoss, tobacco, musk, iris, sandalwood, vetiver, leather, castoreum, patchouli and labdanum.</li>
      <li>smelled EVERY scent they had - which would include most of the popular stuff out there.</li>
      <li>First, the beautiful floral heart that is not overtly femme.</li>
      <li>The 1958 Version: a feminine leather chypre parfum with top notes of clary sage, tarragon and galbanum with heart notes of jasmine, ginger lily, rose and ylang-ylang;</li>
      <li>Well, it turns out I like this BETTER than Bandit except for the opening.  </li>
      <li>It is a memorable perfume - no flowerly simplicity here.</li>
      <li>and I am enjoying it as well as memories of those days.  </li>
      <li>I used Cabochard many years ago.</li>
      <li>Okay, for the price I took a chance.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, I LOVE THE WAY</li>
      <li>but I wanted something more.....</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this perfume in any stores and most people haven&#x27;t even heard of it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE Cabochard.</li>
      <li>I do love Bandit and Azuree</li>
      <li>Lovely and light - many compliments.</li>
      <li>, I love it, so beautiful, such a refreshing scent. .</li>
      <li>In a reformulated format, it felt like it was a disinherited cousin to a wealthy aristocratic original.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get the exact one as was pictured and don&#x27;t like the fragrance quite as much but still like it and appreciate the companies willingness to do whatever it took to make me happy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and not cloying.</li>
      <li>Great price, same transporting scent.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is also slightly different than the original, but still very nice.  </li>
      <li>In case of Cabochard,  have never tried the original.  </li>
      <li>I never smelled the original...</li>
      <li>A significant part of my life is associated with its unmistakeable signature fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still an amazingly &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; scent and works well for many different settings.</li>
      <li>Later, almost a worn &amp; loved suede jacket.</li>
      <li>However, I now have an appreciation for this new-found classic, and I better understand where citrus-leathers (like the lighter &amp; well-done Cerruti Image Woman) may have got inspiration.</li>
      <li>Bandit opens with a peppery-ness that I like a lot, but it fades quickly.  </li>
      <li>The bottle now looks completely different than the old one which had a beautiful and original design.  </li>
      <li>She used it long time ago and loved it.</li>
      <li>Have been using it my entire life, and loved it from the first time I put it on.</li>
      <li>It is not a &#x27;fresh&#x27; scent, but rather, a complex, sophisticated, spicy fragrance as were the perfumes of the 60s and 70s, that I find more suitable for a mature woman than a young girl, It is a sexy and elegant scent which I am happy to return to.  </li>
      <li>but after about 30 minutes the scent settles down a bit and &amp;#34;shades&amp;#34; of the original I loved so well appear.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need some celebrity&#x27;s name on the bottle to know if a scent is worth buying.</li>
      <li>I tend to like unique and unusual fragrances</li>
      <li>I bought it because of the reviews they sounded like it was right up my alley.  </li>
      <li>Truly, this is a unisex classic at a fantastic price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cabochard, as I have commented previously, the more I put it on now, the more I fall in love with this strange unique &#x27;no scent like it&#x27;.</li>
      <li>pretty off-putting at first ...</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>When I first applied Cabochard, I had a what-the-heck reaction.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great scent--nice and complex.  </li>
      <li>I must say it gets better in about an hour, but the first impression right after applying ruins it for me.</li>
      <li>This reminds me of the perfume I used to buy in Jr. High because it was cheap and loud.  </li>
      <li>One of my absolute favorites, rediscovered after many years; how could I have gone so long without wearing this?</li>
      <li>Being new to wearing perfume, having used essential oils instead (love myrrh, frankincense, vetiver, bergamont, cedar)  </li>
      <li>much stronger than the one I had from 12 years ago.</li>
      <li>I had a real cabochard.  </li>
      <li>Well, I was not so much concerned with the loss of money (thankfully, it is very affordable)</li>
      <li>It would be well suited for a woman who wants to make a statement and knows what she wants.</li>
      <li>The modern version of this is a cousin to the original, but still far and above most of what is currently is on the market.  </li>
      <li>I definitely prefer the original and it can still be found on Ebay</li>
      <li>This product is not the same as the original perfume.</li>
      <li>It goes on pretty &amp;#34;stout&amp;#34; and smells a lot like old Charlie cologne ...</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend spending the extra money and puchasing Habanita as it definitely has notes of leather and tobacco and a nice soft finish that lasts.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like flowery parfums, and was hoping for for something classic and timeless.</li>
      <li>and I have paid a much higher price for the exact same thing when I bought it overseas.</li>
      <li>I am familiar with this brand for so long</li>
      <li>I am fully aware that re-formulations are sometimes hard to deal with, especially, if there is a strong attachment with the original formulations.</li>
      <li>He compared re-formulated Cabochard to withered and prematurely aged Peter O&#x27;Tool, nothing like the original Laurence of Arabil \\&quot;god\\&quot;, so to speak.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve decided to try the new formula in my life and see.</li>
      <li>A classic chypre with green and soapy notes, so you will smell both aloof and clean.</li>
      <li>You will not smell it on most American women as they are not familiar with it.</li>
      <li>When I received it, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Not for kids--far too mature.  </li>
      <li>Quite lovely fragrance, not at all common, and lasts a while.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Cabochard since the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Cabochard is not for young girls or those without a developed nose for perfumes.  </li>
      <li>EVERY thing was so sweet &amp; flowery &amp; overpowering, (ie this includes Black Orchid).</li>
      <li>I just got this after reading a review that compared it with Bandit, one of my major favorites.  </li>
      <li>I mean it as the highest compliment when I say it is: Sharp, crisp, aloof, haughty, utterly original, and bone dry as an ice-cold gin martini straight up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s designed for women who prefer the rich and complex.  </li>
      <li>It takes a long while to dry down to be civilized for public consumption.  </li>
      <li>Price is definitely less harsh on the pocketbook than the original formula, but I did LOVE the original. :(</li>
      <li>Cabochard opens less interestingly, but it dries down to smell almost exactly like Bandit but with a little less masculinity.  </li>

<li> Immediately I was shocked by very strong, unpleasant chemical vapor.</li>
<li> - I was looking for a complex, subtle scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lovely and light - many compliments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Cabochard since the early 80&#x27;s. It was my signature scent for over 20 years! I moved away from it as fashion changed and have gone back to revisit it. They&#x27;ve changed the formula ... I definitely prefer the original and it can still be found on Ebay but I&#x27;ve decided to try the new formula in my life and see. It goes on pretty &amp;#34;stout&amp;#34; and smells a lot like old Charlie cologne ... pretty off-putting at first ... but after about 30 minutes the scent settles down a bit and &amp;#34;shades&amp;#34; of the original I loved so well appear. It&#x27;s still an amazingly &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; scent and works well for many different settings. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if they&#x27;d left the formula alone. Price is definitely less harsh on the pocketbook than the original formula, but I did LOVE the original. :(</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used this cologne for over 40 years and didn&#x27;t know if they still made it. Well, Amazon did have it and I am enjoying it as well as memories of those days.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Being new to wearing perfume, having used essential oils instead (love myrrh, frankincense, vetiver, bergamont, cedar)  - I was looking for a complex, subtle scent. My mother used Channel no5 which I liked but I wanted something more..... I did alot of research &amp; visited several dept stores -literally smelled EVERY scent they had - which would include most of the popular stuff out there. EVERY thing was so sweet &amp; flowery &amp; overpowering, (ie this includes Black Orchid). So, did some work online and found the leather chypre scents... of course, these are nearly impossible to find.... so I took a chance &amp; orderd both Cabochard &amp; Bandit online &amp; love them both! Your body chemistry does have to flow w/ these scents and they do not last all day.  I use the Cabochard for workday &amp; Bandit for everything else. No problems w/ my allergies. I work in an environment where perfumes can be problematic but have absolutely no problems wearing either to work.  I also use Cabaret (by Gres) for a lighter, spring/summer scent.</li>
    <li> PERFECT PRODUCT I RECOMENDED FOR EVERYBODY,GOOD FRAGANCE FOR SENIORS I WILL GIVE TO MY MOTHER FOR HOLIDAYS SHE LIKE A LOTS</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume since the 60s.  Wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else.  It is the best and I always get compliments on the fragrance all over the place.</li>
    <li> Cabochard is not for young girls or those without a developed nose for perfumes.  It&#x27;s designed for women who prefer the rich and complex.  If I could afford to bathe in this, I would.  The modern version of this is a cousin to the original, but still far and above most of what is currently is on the market.  No Floriental celebrity perfumes in this bottle!    From Perfume Intelligence:    The 1958 Version: a feminine leather chypre parfum with top notes of clary sage, tarragon and galbanum with heart notes of jasmine, ginger lily, rose and ylang-ylang; base notes of oak moss, sandalwood, vetiver and patchouli, and classified D7f.     The 2000 version: Re-orchestrated with notes of bergamot, mandarin, galbanum, ylang-ylang, jasmine, Bulgarian rose, clove, oakmoss, tobacco, musk, iris, sandalwood, vetiver, leather, castoreum, patchouli and labdanum.</li>
    <li> The Eau De Toilette was one of the best shopping I have done on line QUALITY and PRICE wise.I am familiar with this brand for so long and I have paid a much higher price for the exact same thing when I bought it overseas.</li>
    <li> When I first applied Cabochard, I had a what-the-heck reaction. What was everyone thinking? Herbs &amp; citrus was not what I was expecting from this revered leather. Thankfully I waited, patiently waited. It was an hour before Cabochard began to peel back its layers. First, the beautiful floral heart that is not overtly femme. Then, a smoky, dry strapping leather to rave about. Later, almost a worn &amp; loved suede jacket. It&#x27;s love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m uncertain how wearable Cabochard is for me because it hasn&#x27;t passed the DH (darling husband) test. However, I now have an appreciation for this new-found classic, and I better understand where citrus-leathers (like the lighter &amp; well-done Cerruti Image Woman) may have got inspiration.</li>
    <li> If I could give a zero star to show how this is such a fake and not even a good fake.  Could not even give away ...stinks!!  I had a real cabochard.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I was happy to find Cabochard by Grès on Amazon as it was my signature perfume many years ago.  The bottle now looks completely different than the old one which had a beautiful and original design.  The fragrance is also slightly different than the original, but still very nice.  It is not a &#x27;fresh&#x27; scent, but rather, a complex, sophisticated, spicy fragrance as were the perfumes of the 60s and 70s, that I find more suitable for a mature woman than a young girl, It is a sexy and elegant scent which I am happy to return to.  A little goes a long way...</li>
    <li> I gave these perfumes for Christmas gifts to somebody who has used cabochard all her life and she said that it has changed and had a terrible smell and it is definitely not the Cabochard that it used to be</li>
    <li> This perfume smells very nice. I never smelled the original...but I like this one!</li>
    <li> One of my absolute favorites, rediscovered after many years; how could I have gone so long without wearing this? I mean it as the highest compliment when I say it is: Sharp, crisp, aloof, haughty, utterly original, and bone dry as an ice-cold gin martini straight up. A classic chypre with green and soapy notes, so you will smell both aloof and clean. Don&#x27;t let the low price put you off. It smells expensive. I LOVE LOVE Cabochard.</li>
    <li> much stronger than the one I had from 12 years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got this fragrance for the friend. She used it long time ago and loved it. She could not find it and was very pleased when I&#x27;ve send it to her.</li>
    <li> This review is for the gentlemen out there. If you like Aramis, but cannot afford, or do not want to pay the extra, consider Cabochard. They&#x27;re remarkably similar; it&#x27;s essentially Aramis with less clove and a tiny bit of floral. Don&#x27;t worry about the floral; it&#x27;s not enough to make it truly feminine. Truly, this is a unisex classic at a fantastic price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, anyone who dislikes Aramis or Estee Lauder&#x27;s Azuree should not buy this. All three were created by the same perfumer (Bernard Chant), and all have a similar scent and feel to them.</li>
    <li> Quite lovely fragrance, not at all common, and lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I just got this after reading a review that compared it with Bandit, one of my major favorites.  Well, it turns out I like this BETTER than Bandit except for the opening.  Bandit opens with a peppery-ness that I like a lot, but it fades quickly.  Cabochard opens less interestingly, but it dries down to smell almost exactly like Bandit but with a little less masculinity.  It&#x27;s a great scent--nice and complex.  Not for kids--far too mature.  While it is recommended for evening, I&#x27;m wearing it in the daytime, too.</li>
    <li> I recently came across information on Madam Gres&#x27;s timeless designs and, as a sidetrack, read about the designer&#x27;s perfumes. I am fully aware that re-formulations are sometimes hard to deal with, especially, if there is a strong attachment with the original formulations. For example, I still cannot come to terms with the rewamping of Rive Gauche. A significant part of my life is associated with its unmistakeable signature fragrance. In a reformulated format, it felt like it was a disinherited cousin to a wealthy aristocratic original. Eventually, I embraced its simplified persona and included it into my perfume \\&quot;pallette\\&quot;. In case of Cabochard,  have never tried the original.  I read the reviews, both positive and negative, and decided to give it a try. After I had made a purchase, I came across a particularly bitter review by Luca Turin, one of the estimed experts on the subject of parfumery. He compared re-formulated Cabochard to withered and prematurely aged Peter O&#x27;Tool, nothing like the original Laurence of Arabil \\&quot;god\\&quot;, so to speak. I was horrified. Well, I was not so much concerned with the loss of money (thankfully, it is very affordable) but by the fact that I was tricked into buying it. When I received it, I was pleasantly surprised. It is a memorable perfume - no flowerly simplicity here. It would be well suited for a woman who wants to make a statement and knows what she wants. I might still hunt it down on ebay one of these days but I am perfectly content with this \\&quot;imposter\\&quot;. I do love Bandit and Azuree but Cabochard will take its proper place in my collection of perfumes to reflect my executive power and confidence moods and roles I need to play in life.</li>
    <li> This was incredibly unlike the original.</li>
    <li> Have been using it my entire life, and loved it from the first time I put it on. I think it may be discontinued, which is a shame. I don&#x27;t need some celebrity&#x27;s name on the bottle to know if a scent is worth buying.</li>
    <li> This smells just like Aramis mens cologne!  NASTY, AWFUL.  What on earth was Madam Gres smoking when she created this one!!!!</li>
    <li> The fragrance was nce, but the spray was difficult coming out.</li>
    <li> Okay, for the price I took a chance.  The smell is quite vile and seems to be perfumed with chemicals rather than essential oils.  I was seduced by the description of the fragrance notes: citrus, leather, and tobacco.  I would highly recommend spending the extra money and puchasing Habanita as it definitely has notes of leather and tobacco and a nice soft finish that lasts.  This reminds me of the perfume I used to buy in Jr. High because it was cheap and loud.  I&#x27;m sorry to those who do like it but if you are buying sight unsmelled, I would definitely go another direction.</li>
    <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T OPENED THIS PARFUM YET. HOWEVER, I LOVE THE WAY THE BOTTLE LOOKS SITTING ON MY PERFUME TRAY ON MY DRESSER.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this perfume in any stores and most people haven&#x27;t even heard of it. I used to buy several bottles of it when I went overseas every year, but don&#x27;t go every year now. I was frantically looking for it and googled--there it was!  Women  often ask what I&#x27;m wearing . It&#x27;s light and not cloying. I&#x27;ve loved it for years.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the reviews they sounded like it was right up my alley.  I tend to like unique and unusual fragrances however, this one is a bit too off beat for me.  It takes a long while to dry down to be civilized for public consumption.  I will not be making a second purchase.</li>
    <li> I used Cabochard many years ago. It was introduced in the 60&#x27;s. This product is not the same as the original perfume. It has a very strong and unpleasant (to me) aroma.</li>
    <li> Cabochard, as I have commented previously, the more I put it on now, the more I fall in love with this strange unique &#x27;no scent like it&#x27;. I would buy it again and again, I love it, so beautiful, such a refreshing scent. .</li>
    <li> I last purchased this years ago in Paris.  Great price, same transporting scent.  You will not smell it on most American women as they are not familiar with it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the exact one as was pictured and don&#x27;t like the fragrance quite as much but still like it and appreciate the companies willingness to do whatever it took to make me happy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like flowery parfums, and was hoping for for something classic and timeless. Immediately I was shocked by very strong, unpleasant chemical vapor. I must say it gets better in about an hour, but the first impression right after applying ruins it for me.</li>
    <li> I loved the product of great quality would buy again . . . . . . . . . .</li>
