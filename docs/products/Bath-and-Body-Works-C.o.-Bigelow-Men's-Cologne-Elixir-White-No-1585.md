      <li>Great price for the quantity you get and last a while.</li>
      <li>C.O. Bigelow No.032 Bay Rum Original Formulary Cologne</li>
      <li>Great for just everday when you want to just spritz with something a little light and masculine to refresh yourself and make sure you&#x27;re not giving off &#x27;the funk.&#x27;</li>
      <li>He is 30 years old, so he wanted to smell age appropriate...</li>

      <li>/&gt;Bigelow produces quality products and this one comes highly recommended.</li>
      <li>White No 1585 is a fresh, citrusy smelling cologne that can be worn during the day or evening.  </li>
      <li>so you see that I am old school when it comes to fragrances.</li>
      <li>When I smelled this one, it reminded me of a fruitier/lighter version of Old Spice.  </li>
      <li>Mature yet not old.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great stuff...The ladies love it.</li>
    <li> Really nice daytime cologne at a very reasonable price. It&#x27;s scent stay on during the day. People tend to comment (positively) on its effect.</li>
    <li> I had intended to order the Bigelow Bay Rum cologne and mistakenly clicked on this product. This fragrance has staying power and is, in fact, reminiscent of a barber shop. More importantly, the women in my life love the scent.</li>
    <li> My hubby is an &amp;#34;old soul&amp;#34; and loves to smell great every day for work or going out.  He gets his hair cut at a real barbershop, so I was intrigued by this line when I saw it in Bath &amp; Body Works.  When I smelled this one, it reminded me of a fruitier/lighter version of Old Spice.  He is 30 years old, so he wanted to smell age appropriate... Mature yet not old.  He is very happy with this scent.  And as his wife, it makes me pretty happy too :-)</li>
    <li> Nice product, good price, and all the packing is recyclable!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it!!  Much better deal than most fragrances that are 5X the price!</li>
    <li> Love this. A friend turned me on to it by giving me a half-filled used bottle and I&#x27;ve bought it ever since. Great for just everday when you want to just spritz with something a little light and masculine to refresh yourself and make sure you&#x27;re not giving off &#x27;the funk.&#x27; Great price for the quantity you get and last a while. It&#x27;s not my premium fragrance for special occassions usually, but for everyday freshness / nice scent, it&#x27;s light and crisp, fresh, and I&#x27;ve often gotten compliments on it. I recommend!</li>
    <li> White No 1585 is a fresh, citrusy smelling cologne that can be worn during the day or evening.  I have most of the other Bigelow fragrances and this one might have just earned the &#x27;favorite&#x27; spot with me.</li>
    <li> Picked this up at bath and body works and I have to say this smells great. Im a cologne collector and this smells beat some of my $50+ ones. It kind of reminds me of polo green and smells very manly.</li>
    <li> This is the cologne my boyfriend wears and it is absolutely wonderful. I try to make sure he always has it.</li>
    <li> Everything went fine and as planned...love this cologne!</li>
    <li> This order came on time &amp; has it&#x27;s authentic smell;no better way or deal comes close...... Appreciationz :)</li>
    <li> At last, cologne that smells like a top-shelf vodka tonic.  All the women in my life can rest easy;  I&#x27;m officially in love with myself.  That&#x27;s how good this cologne smells.</li>
    <li> always complimented on the clan, fresh smell of this product----and it lasts----keep one in the car and one at home.</li>
    <li> My son purchased this cologne for me and I am impressed. I am a fan of [[ASIN:B0085UECY2 Proraso Aftershave Lotion, Refresh, 100 ml]] and [[ASIN:B001EZ3XU4 Bath &amp; Body Works C.O. Bigelow No.032 Bay Rum Original Formulary Cologne For Men 3.4 fl oz (100 ml)]] so you see that I am old school when it comes to fragrances. Bigelow 1585 has a pleasing, herbal, woodsy scent that lasts a long time, but isn&#x27;t too overpowering. I have received quite a few compliments. It really isn&#x27;t an aftershave and because I shave 5 times/week, I usually save this scent for evenings.&lt;br /&gt;Bigelow produces quality products and this one comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter - ask her!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my son... he loves it!</li>
    <li> Nice sporty fragrance cologne for men.</li>
    <li> Great scent! Quick delivery!</li>
