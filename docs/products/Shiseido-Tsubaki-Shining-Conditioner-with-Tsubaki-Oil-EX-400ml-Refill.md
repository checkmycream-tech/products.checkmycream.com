### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the best conditioner I have tried.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is great!  </li>
      <li>This is the best line compared to the Damage Care and Head Spa.</li>
      <li>The best shampoo and the conditioner,  they give you the shine you are looking for!</li>
      <li>Delivery service is great and the product is excellent.</li>
      <li>This is a great conditioner.</li>
      <li>Good price and good value.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted to be able to purchase it here in the States!</li>
      <li>Smell is great, too :)</li>
      <li>sure if this is a knock-off and in fact my hair started to get brittle after using it!</li>
      <li>The scent of Tsubaki isn&#x27;t as nice as Aquaxxxx, IMO.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, each product can stand on its own, but I would recommend to try both.</li>
      <li>I have been using this conditioner for many years</li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>love the silky feel it gives my hair.</li>
      <li>This works the best for my bleached, frizzy, dry and damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I had used this at a friends and tried to get hold of it in London ( where i live) with no avail, now that i have found it on amazon, im thrilled!</li>
      <li>Easy to use refill.  </li>
      <li>it really smooth my hair.</li>
      <li>Do you want to have smooth hair like silk?</li>
      <li>that if it&#x27;s sulfate free,</li>
      <li>It took me forever to realize I needed to be using Asian products on it, and Shiseido is the absolute best.</li>
      <li>I have long fine hair with highlights and this conditioner does a great job making my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>I was so excited since I do not hav eto go to Japan town in San Fracisco to get thsi product</li>
      <li>I have a short bob and have it colored, with all the heating my hair goes through to keep it looking good</li>
      <li>I think it might be good for coarse hair to reduce the roughness though.</li>
      <li>but I love the way it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, with a healthy shine, and tamed (goodbye frizz).</li>
      <li>The new packaging appears to have the same product in it, amazing scent.</li>
      <li>And I feel like it weights too much for my already very straight hair...</li>
      <li>It doesnt&#x27; soften my hair much as Aquaxxxx did.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use a shampoo that has too much perfume in, and I have allergy to lots of scents.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell much difference between this product and drugstore ones.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but conditions gently and leaves a nice softness and natural shine.</li>
      <li>Maybe my expectation was too high, from the experience from using the treatment product.</li>
      <li>If you want soft, silky hair, this is the stuff!</li>
      <li>I only put in on my hair ends and my bangs because it&#x27;s very rich and can make your hair style look pretty flat unless you have thick hair.</li>
      <li>It conditions without leaving it flat and heavy, my hair feels natural, soft and full of life, Im hooked!</li>
      <li>I have a high quality Asian hair weave.</li>

    <li> love the silky feel it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great!  It isn&#x27;t heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t skimp on the conditioning either!  Smell is great, too :)</li>
    <li> I had used this at a friends and tried to get hold of it in London ( where i live) with no avail, now that i have found it on amazon, im thrilled! I have a short bob and have it colored, with all the heating my hair goes through to keep it looking good,I was concerned about my hair&#x27;s health. I was amazed after using tsubaki conditioner. It conditions without leaving it flat and heavy, my hair feels natural, soft and full of life, Im hooked! and oh! it smells fab!</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair with highlights and this conditioner does a great job making my hair smooth and shiny. I only put in on my hair ends and my bangs because it&#x27;s very rich and can make your hair style look pretty flat unless you have thick hair.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo and the conditioner,  they give you the shine you are looking for!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend and it&#x27;s the third time I have bought both, the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I do see a big difference in my hair when I use both products together. It leaves my hair soft, with a healthy shine, and tamed (goodbye frizz). Oh, and it also smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, each product can stand on its own, but I would recommend to try both.</li>
    <li> it really smooth my hair. i love it. i think it should be used for everyday with other Tsubaki products.</li>
    <li> Good price and good value. I have recommended it to all of my friends! Do you want to have smooth hair like silk? Use it!</li>
    <li> I have used the Shiseido Tsubaki Shining Shampoo and Conditioner for 2 years. The new packaging appears to have the same product in it, amazing scent. This works the best for my bleached, frizzy, dry and damaged hair. This is the best line compared to the Damage Care and Head Spa. The Damage Care shampoo is BAD, but the conditioner is okay.</li>
    <li> Delivery service is great and the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> My order came in the mail from Japan I was so excited since I do not hav eto go to Japan town in San Fracisco to get thsi product I can just order it online.</li>
    <li> I have an odd review- not sure what&#x27;s going on but this refill is not working as the Shiseido I&#x27;ve ordered from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is a knock-off and in fact my hair started to get brittle after using it!</li>
    <li> Ever since I visited Japan about 5 years ago, I&#x27;ve been addicted to this conditioner. It&#x27;s tough to find but I love the way it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okey product from Shiseido. I used their Aquaxxxx(sorry I forget the name, but it&#x27;s in blue tube) hair treatment before, and I adored it. So I decided to try Shiseido&#x27;s other product. The scent of Tsubaki isn&#x27;t as nice as Aquaxxxx, IMO. And I feel like it weights too much for my already very straight hair...I think it might be good for coarse hair to reduce the roughness though. It doesnt&#x27; soften my hair much as Aquaxxxx did. so I was kinda disappointed. Maybe my expectation was too high, from the experience from using the treatment product. Anyway, I think overall it&#x27;s an okey product for me. I can&#x27;t tell much difference between this product and drugstore ones. They don&#x27;t advertise it on the package that if it&#x27;s sulfate free, but I checked ingredients, it seems like it doesn&#x27;t have it...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use a shampoo that has too much perfume in, and I have allergy to lots of scents. But I think Japanese style is much less perfume than American products. At least, I don&#x27;t get a headache from it.</li>
    <li> I have a high quality Asian hair weave. It took me forever to realize I needed to be using Asian products on it, and Shiseido is the absolute best. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but conditions gently and leaves a nice softness and natural shine. If you don&#x27;t like heavily chemical products, however, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> If you want soft, silky hair, this is the stuff! It&#x27;s all I use now on my blonde hair. Was recommended by a friend, and it delivers!</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for many years and it&#x27;s the best conditioner I have tried.</li>
    <li> As with the Shampoo, I used the conditioner while living in Japan.  I&#x27;m delighted to be able to purchase it here in the States!</li>
    <li> Easy to use refill.  This is a great conditioner.</li>
