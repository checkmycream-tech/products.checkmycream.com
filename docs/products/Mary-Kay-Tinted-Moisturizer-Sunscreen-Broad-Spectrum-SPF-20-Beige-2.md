    <li> Mary Kay&#x27;s bestselling item and it&#x27;s no surprise. Covers blemishes, is oil-free, is well-formulated, and doesn&#x27;t promote break-outs, and doesn&#x27;t look like you are wearing a heavy layer of make up. My teen swears by it!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer it has never failed.  I can wear this instead of having to put on foundation and it keeps my face moist and soft.  The only thing that I do not like is the various prices.</li>
    <li> Love this product, but Mary Kay has stopped selling it. So I made sure I bought three. I wear it everyday, it&#x27;s very light and has sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing foundation at all (I am in my 40s).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy makeup. For instance, wearing red lip gloss is like an event loll. However,  I wanted to experiment more with make-up without going over board (I don&#x27;t have a clue how to apply foundation or smokey eyes or anything like that... My luck I try and end up looking like Twisted Sister lol).&lt;br /&gt; However, this Mary Kay concealer does the trick. Easy to apply (if you buy the right shade) it gives my face a natural pick me up. I totally forget i have it on. And it has a SPF of 20. And this seller got it to me fast. I&#x27;ll be ordering this again for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this product...I use Beige 2.  Sad that Mary Kay discontinued it.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller.  Very pleased..</li>
    <li> On the Q &amp; A section it says that this is not an official MK product as it does not come in SPF 20. My neighbor used to be a consultant and she has given me what she had left over. It does come in SPF 20 and is an official MK product. I just wanted to clear that question up with a correct answer. Although they have discontinued it, and now going under tinted cc cream in a black tube. I have not tried the newer kind but I absolutely love the old kind of tinted moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 20</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what Mary Kay was thinking when they discontinued this product.  Thank goodness I found it online and have enough for a couple of years.  I will have to find another product later, because what Mary Kay replaced this with is so heavy and mask like.</li>
    <li> Cover flaws well if that&#x27;s what your looking for. I ordered the beige 2 and it&#x27;s a bit dark for me as I&#x27;m light completed. But I decided on this for the price and the SPF factor which will do. Especially if I&#x27;m just going out to work on the outside chores I wish Mary Kay had given color tints so The buyer would know specifically what tint to choose.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful...You can hardly tell you have it on...LOVE IT!  Having the sunscreen SPF 20 is a big hit too!!</li>
    <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve been using several years that Mary Kay has now discontinued so I was thrilled I found it on amazon.  It&#x27;s very good for my super-sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few foundations which are NOT orange.  The taupe color blends with any skin tone.  Best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All other over the counter foundations and colored moisturizers have an orange tint and look fake..  This is absolutely one of the best and has a SPF of 20.  I use it over my clear moisturizer and it blends very well.  No one can tell you have a foundation on, and it erases brown spots.  The best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> wife just loves mary kay tinted moisturizer !!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup and I love this tinted moisturizer ..just enough cover and sunscreen..perfect for summer....love it</li>
    <li> This is a nice light moisturizer and color. I wear it all the time. I wear it over regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> great price arrived fast and was the color i ordered. i looked around and this was best price for the product i needed!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this produce for many years and continue to love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product but bought the wrong shade.  I jus mix it with a lighter one that I have and it is OK.  Next time I will get the right shade.</li>
