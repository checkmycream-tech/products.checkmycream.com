### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>LOL :p</li>
      <li>the bright side, this tape doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue like others have.  </li>
      <li>When you get a good tape and a good application</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
      <li>I hope the tape can be more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the appropriate size for me</li>
      <li>It worked okay.</li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>Finally the product successfully arrived America from Hong Kong!</li>
      <li>If you live in a warm climate like I do, just glance in the mirror every so often to make sure you don&#x27;t have shiny streaks running across your eyes.  </li>
      <li>So, when I saw these I thought that the tape would be basically the same and that I was getting a great deal, this was not the case.</li>
      <li>While you get a lot of the product for a cheap price, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only good thing</li>
      <li>But overall it was nice to try out.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;ll work with it because i dont want to wait another couple months for my the right order</li>
      <li>, I used up around 12 tapes to find the right places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>This eye-lid tape really works!</li>
      <li>Could still be even wider across to totally cover the top lid.</li>
      <li>This is the first time buying the eyelid tape</li>
      <li>A little bit thicker than most double sided tapes but uis wider which is nice.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare to</li>
      <li>But it did came in really fast though.</li>
      <li>And the tape really works with my eyelid.</li>
      <li>I love the shape of this tape,it&#x27;s really not noticeable!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and i didnt like it as much</li>
      <li>the fork that comes with it is really good, it is more curvy than usual forks so it helps the tape go deeper in to the eye and again, makes it less noticeable.</li>
      <li>would recommend this for newbies like me, because it&#x27;s not too expansive so you won&#x27;t feel too bad when you first try to find the perfect spot for the tapes</li>
      <li>Use a wooden cuticle short stick on the corner of tape, then press and it comes off easily!</li>
      <li>strength isn&#x27;t as stick as Darkness tape or other top brands like that, but it still stays on for pretty much the whole day, and replacing it once is no problem, considering you get like 200+ pairs for only 6 bucks.</li>
      <li>lids are not thick so a &amp;#34;slim&amp;#34; double-sided tape works for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten them to apply well after many, many attempts and irritating my lid only to have the tape release after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t know if I am applying this tape incorrectly or not (because it did not come with any instructions), but it is kind of difficult for me to remove the tape and apply it with the applicator that is provided.  </li>
      <li>Also, this tape is longer than most double eyelid tapes, so sometimes the corners leave little tell-tale</li>
      <li>Not are clear..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s because the product came early than expected!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t work for the whole day.</li>
      <li>, the tape only stayed about 5 hours tops on my lids (but also consider I have really oily</li>
      <li>Just be aware that once the tape starts to loose its adhesiveness, the shiny tape will be noticeable on your eye.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d rather purchased a higher quality that&#x27;s a bit more expensive .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad for the price, it works, but I hope the tape is stickier, bigger, and harder.</li>
      <li>It takes lots of practice to get the application down right</li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving three stars is because my product came very, very early.</li>
      <li>when applied properly, this tape is foolproof and natural looking!</li>
      <li>but the results are totally worth the trouble.</li>
      <li>will be going back to the other brand, unfortunately, because it holds for the entire day and into the night, even on hot, sticky days when my skin tends to get more oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i stopped using it after 3 tries,,,, the rest i just used it as normal double sided tape for projects</li>

<li> I have been using another brand but the shipping was soooooo expensive that it was not economical to order them unless I could buy many at one time</li>
<li> but sometime this will stick together or sometime the front and back little tiny thing that can not stick like long time</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to seperate the tape from the white paper and when you finally do get them apart the ends of the tape have stuck back on</li>

<li> Other than that</li>
<li> They are hard to get off the sheets and then the white paper lining is even harder to remove after the tape has been applied.</li>
<li> I tried two days and after I took it off I could already see the new double-eyelid line, but the thing is when I applied it on it is too thin to hold my eyelid all the way up</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really confused on how this worked for anyone because the tapes are almost completely vertical with no curve to it.</li>
<li> It also loses its adhesiveness within just a few hours.</li>
<li> Tape is very thick and hard to get off strip!</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> i got the wrong order of eyelid tape.</li>
<li> But found secret how to take off strip!</li>
<li> /&gt;Not too bad, but not great.</li>
<li> would tell anyone who suffers from a droopy lid to try these.</li>
<li> Also, the tapes are sticky on both sides so application is very difficult.</li>
<li> but the quality is horrible.</li>

    <li> Not as sticky as I want it to.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving three stars is because my product came very, very early. If it weren&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d give it two stars. While you get a lot of the product for a cheap price, you get what you pay for. The adhesive sides are not very sticky at all, and if you have the average, mono-lidded, Asian eyes, these won&#x27;t stick your skin together for long.</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t know if I am applying this tape incorrectly or not (because it did not come with any instructions), but it is kind of difficult for me to remove the tape and apply it with the applicator that is provided.  I ended up having to use a different applicator that I received in another order of double-sided eyelid tape.  Also, this tape is longer than most double eyelid tapes, so sometimes the corners leave little tell-tale signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, this tape doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue like others have.  Just be aware that once the tape starts to loose its adhesiveness, the shiny tape will be noticeable on your eye.  If you live in a warm climate like I do, just glance in the mirror every so often to make sure you don&#x27;t have shiny streaks running across your eyes.  Other than that when applied properly, this tape is foolproof and natural looking!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad for the price, it works, but I hope the tape is stickier, bigger, and harder. But overall it was nice to try out.</li>
    <li> Finally the product successfully arrived America from Hong Kong! Thank you so much! And the tape really works with my eyelid. It&#x27;s the appropriate size for me( i&#x27;m asian). The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t work for the whole day. I hope the tape can be more sticker~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really confused on how this worked for anyone because the tapes are almost completely vertical with no curve to it. This might just be me but my eyelids are curved. Also, the tapes are sticky on both sides so application is very difficult. I attempted to use 7 or 8 of them and have given up the remaining 232 tapes.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well. It also loses its adhesiveness within just a few hours. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Not are clear..they are white..I can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;:-((</li>
    <li> This is the first time buying the eyelid tape so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare to, the tape only stayed about 5 hours tops on my lids (but also consider I have really oily eyelids).&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I still gave it a 4 stars it&#x27;s because the product came early than expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for newbies like me, because it&#x27;s not too expansive so you won&#x27;t feel too bad when you first try to find the perfect spot for the tapes, I used up around 12 tapes to find the right places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too bad, but not great.</li>

Totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Also the fork that comes with it is really good, it is more curvy than usual forks so it helps the tape go deeper in to the eye and again, makes it less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have been using another brand but the shipping was soooooo expensive that it was not economical to order them unless I could buy many at one time and then I would be charged individual shipping on each pack! OUCH! So, when I saw these I thought that the tape would be basically the same and that I was getting a great deal, this was not the case. This tape has been listed as DS but then in the description all the way at the bottom of the page it says these are single sided! They are hard to get off the sheets and then the white paper lining is even harder to remove after the tape has been applied. It&#x27;s hard to seperate the tape from the white paper and when you finally do get them apart the ends of the tape have stuck back on it&#x27;s self causing a lump in the tape at the ends. Now you finllay get the tape on your lid and it&#x27;s not strong enough to create and hold the crease. I&#x27;ve gotten them to apply well after many, many attempts and irritating my lid only to have the tape release after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to the other brand, unfortunately, because it holds for the entire day and into the night, even on hot, sticky days when my skin tends to get more oily.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for a drooping lid, I am caucasion and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I would tell anyone who suffers from a droopy lid to try these. I&#x27;ve had over 15 surgeries to correct my droopiness but one eye just won&#x27;t take to the corrective surgery. It takes lots of practice to get the application down right but the results are totally worth the trouble. When you get a good tape and a good application NO ONE will ever know that you have a ptosis/droopy lid.&lt;br /&gt;My lids are not thick so a &amp;#34;slim&amp;#34; double-sided tape works for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I would post a before and after but they don&#x27;t have a place to put a photo here.</li>
    <li> It worked okay.I tried two days and after I took it off I could already see the new double-eyelid line, but the thing is when I applied it on it is too thin to hold my eyelid all the way up so I was like trible-eyelid while I was wearing it.</li>
    <li> Do not adhere and no instructions.</li>
    <li> Some of the tape got damaged before I received the item. This item did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that it&#x27;s cheap but the quality is horrible. The tape doesn&#x27;t even stick to my eyelid. Sorry but I&#x27;d rather purchased a higher quality that&#x27;s a bit more expensive . But it did came in really fast though. That&#x27;s the only good thing</li>
    <li> This eye-lid tape really works! I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
    <li> i got the wrong order of eyelid tape. but i tried the product anyways and i didnt like it as much but i&#x27;ll work with it because i dont want to wait another couple months for my the right order</li>
    <li> upper eye lid won stay stick to it for long,,,only about 30 mins or so, also it&#x27;s so obvious and its showing...i stopped using it after 3 tries,,,, the rest i just used it as normal double sided tape for projects LOL :p</li>
    <li> i like this product but sometime this will stick together or sometime the front and back little tiny thing that can not stick like long time</li>
    <li> Tape is very thick and hard to get off strip! But found secret how to take off strip! Use a wooden cuticle short stick on the corner of tape, then press and it comes off easily! A little bit thicker than most double sided tapes but uis wider which is nice. Could still be even wider across to totally cover the top lid.</li>
