      <li>Easy to use; effective tools for oral hygiene.</li>
      <li>Makes you feel better.</li>
      <li>but I like the go betweens brushes better.  </li>
      <li>Could be better if the wire was stronger to avoid bending brushes.</li>
      <li>The angle of brushes make them perfect for reaching back teeth.  </li>
      <li>From my long-time use this has been the best routine (along with regular cleaning and visits to a dentist).</li>
      <li>This brush cleans between teeth better than dental floss.</li>
      <li>Bought these because the price was right, even though I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the angled kind.</li>
      <li>I have a mouth full of bridges and crowns and have used similar products, but Plackers are the best.</li>

      <li>Also, they&#x27;re pretty sturdy, in that the &amp;#34;spine&amp;#34; of the brush doesn&#x27;t collapse easily if you put pressure on it.</li>
      <li>As mentioned, they are a straight brush, but I easily bend the brush part a little to manually make it an angled brush to reach my back teeth, and so far that brush has worked the best for me for that purpose.</li>
      <li>the picks.&lt;br /&gt;The wire is both fine enough to get between my teeth and strong enough that is doesn&#x27;t bend out of shape easily.</li>
      <li>Great for hard to reach spaces.  </li>

      <li>Since I started using Plackers, my checkups are much improved.  </li>
      <li>My teeth are spaced very closely so everyone may not have this problem.</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>These brushes are a real bargain.</li>
      <li>On top of that it&#x27;s too thick and doesn&#x27;t even fit between my teeth.</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s second order - he liked the first so much, preferring it over other types of interdental brushes.  </li>
      <li>Clever angled brush.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>They are a straight brush, but they are a little more rigid where you can push food through your teeth better without the brush giving way at least not giving way as much as the plackers brushes do.  </li>
      <li>Dental floss is useful occasionally.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re just as good as the green, more expensive ones, last a bit longer, and have a cover to keep the bristles clean.</li>
      <li>Good on hard to reach back teeth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the straight ones up until now.</li>
      <li>Small, easy to pack for travel use.</li>
      <li>These brushes (which I was unable to find locally) are really good for &amp;#34;in between&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Like that there is a right angle - allows for getting between tight teeth and brackets around braces.</li>
      <li>The go betweens brush part is a little shorter and seems to also be a little more rigid.  </li>
      <li>The plackers brush part is a little longer and a little more flimsy.  </li>

    <li> I bought these angle brushes because I have a gap between two back teeth, and it&#x27;s hard to get food out between them with a straight brush.  I thought since these brushes were angled that they would be perfect.  For me, these are o.k., but I like the go betweens brushes better.  They are a straight brush, but they are a little more rigid where you can push food through your teeth better without the brush giving way at least not giving way as much as the plackers brushes do.  I know that probably sounds gross, but it&#x27;s the truth! :o)  The plackers brush part is a little longer and a little more flimsy.  The go betweens brush part is a little shorter and seems to also be a little more rigid.  As mentioned, they are a straight brush, but I easily bend the brush part a little to manually make it an angled brush to reach my back teeth, and so far that brush has worked the best for me for that purpose.</li>
    <li> the brush needs a stiffer wire, bends too easily.  My teeth are spaced very closely so everyone may not have this problem.</li>
    <li> 5-Stars all the way! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good dental brushes</li>
    <li> I have large spaces between my back 2 teeth, which get packed when I eat meat or chicken.  Plackers are the only product that allows mw to reach back and remove the meat!</li>
    <li> It is good for your teeth. My family all use this brush every day. The price is cheaper than last time.</li>
    <li> Great for congestion. Put in hot water the smell is great. Makes you feel better. Have to use 2 or 3 times hourly.</li>
    <li> They work well, hard to find localy</li>

    <li> These brushes are a real bargain. They&#x27;re just as good as the green, more expensive ones, last a bit longer, and have a cover to keep the bristles clean.</li>
    <li> Most effective brush for between teeth I have found.  Angled head makee it easy to floss the back teeth, Each brush lasts about ten brushes.</li>
    <li> Prefer brushes to dental floss.  These are great for the back of the mouth.  Dental floss is useful occasionally.  Use the brushes, then a Waterpik and then an electric toothbrush.  Follow-up once a week with a detox using sesame or coconut oil and then post your experience good or bad. From my long-time use this has been the best routine (along with regular cleaning and visits to a dentist).</li>

    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s second order - he liked the first so much, preferring it over other types of interdental brushes.  He is rough with items, and it didn&#x27;t bend or break apart as another reviewer stated.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely fantastic.  I use them in-between all my teeth where my toothbrush can&#x27;t get to.  My mouth is much happier and dental bills are much lower.  Prior to using my gums were getting sore but now they are great.  The dentist said my gums are very healthy now.</li>
    <li> This brush cleans between teeth better than dental floss. The right-angle configuration is an improvement on the simple toothpick sized brushes; the angle makes it easier to insert between molars.</li>
    <li> Bought these because the price was right, even though I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the angled kind. I&#x27;ve only used the straight ones up until now. Turns out these are great for getting to hard-to-reach areas. Also, they&#x27;re pretty sturdy, in that the &amp;#34;spine&amp;#34; of the brush doesn&#x27;t collapse easily if you put pressure on it. The actual brush part is quite thin, so they work in between teeth as well as for cleaning around bridges. I will definitely be ordering these again, assuming the price stays low.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Price is outrageous.  Same product for 2.99 on drugstore.com.  See for yourself.</li>
    <li> I like the brush, however I find it&#x27;s not sturdy enough to do the job. It collapses instead of brushing. The brush part breaks off with pressure. Careful!</li>
    <li> These are great and provide the same function as the product from a leading toothpaste manufacturer for a significantly cheaper price.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  But search on internet for a cheaper price:  10 pack typically goes for $2.99  elsewhere.  Even with $5 shipping it&#x27;s way cheaper (and the more packs you get, the same shipping, it&#x27;s way, way cheaper overall. Again, GREAT PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. C.</li>
    <li> If you need to use toothpicks after a meal, then I recommend it for you.  It is much easy to use it to remove food fragments between teeth.</li>
    <li> The angle of brushes make them perfect for reaching back teeth.  The little brush can be bent to conform to the shape of your teeth.  I sterilize mine and re-use them until the brush is not longer holding it&#x27;s shape.  Will buy these again.</li>
    <li> This made my gums bleed and I did feel like it actually cleaned in between my teeth. Trashed them!</li>
    <li> Clever angled brush.  Great for hard to reach spaces.  Like that there is a right angle - allows for getting between tight teeth and brackets around braces.</li>
    <li> Easy to use; effective tools for oral hygiene. Small, easy to pack for travel use.</li>
    <li> The metal wire bends too easily and the end is blunt and feels like it&#x27;s scratching my teeth. On top of that it&#x27;s too thick and doesn&#x27;t even fit between my teeth. Useless.</li>
    <li> They are easy to get between my teeth</li>
    <li> The items were delivered on time and as described</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have found to enhance dental health.  Since I started using Plackers, my checkups are much improved.  I have a mouth full of bridges and crowns and have used similar products, but Plackers are the best.</li>
    <li> These work very well. The angle makes it very easy to position the picks.&lt;br /&gt;The wire is both fine enough to get between my teeth and strong enough that is doesn&#x27;t bend out of shape easily.</li>
    <li> Thank you seller , your products very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the handle of this brush, very nice and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best regards&lt;br /&gt;Abdul</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  I am a former dentist and these devices augment floss in a number of circumstances.  However, they should be sold through Amazon Prime directly and not as a purchase from a secondary source for lots of reasons.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these and I could not find them in any local drugstore.  Brush gets into places that are difficult to clean.  Could be better if the wire was stronger to avoid bending brushes.</li>
