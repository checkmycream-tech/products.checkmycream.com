      <li>Great Product....</li>
      <li>So, when I found Oro, I was happy about the price and decided to try.</li>

      <li>WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO AMAZING.</li>
      <li>It seemed like this product was amazing</li>
      <li>That’s nice.</li>
      <li>Nice touch.</li>
      <li>I think you can get just as good or even better products for 90% at CVS or Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>really liked what this lady had to say.</li>
      <li>I read so many good reviews about this Oro peeling jel before I decided to buy.  </li>
      <li>It was a nice experience.</li>
      <li>Really liked that.</li>
      <li>My skin feels nice after.</li>
      <li>, my skin looked super beautiful.</li>
      <li>The oro is really good quality , this peal is so gentle , but very effective , as u will see when u do it over the sink .</li>
      <li>It just seems too good to be true.</li>
      <li>But, I am definitely in love with Orogold and their products.</li>
      <li>Many people say that it&#x27;s the product that is being flaked off your skin.  </li>
      <li>I haven’t seen many of them in beauty stores.</li>
      <li>My husband tried out the peel too, he thinks he would need more try&#x27;s before passing judgment.  </li>
      <li>Also, many women have said that you see the skin just sluff off...</li>
      <li>My wife loves it and even had me get her more when I was in Vegas on business.  </li>
      <li>for me, I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>Sooo glad I didn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>It looked radiant, shiny, glowy, sexy...</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;ve written more than one review on Amazon over the years, so you know my attestation here is true.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing better for face peeling.  </li>
      <li>like so many seem to be saying.</li>
      <li>Best in the market for deep exfoliation and peel!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care about the pushy sales, I am so glad I bought this product and have continued using it all of these years.</li>
      <li>And, am I glad that I met that lady at the store.</li>
      <li>GLAD</li>
      <li>This is the best facial peel I have ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>Some people suggested that using Orogold twice a week was safe.</li>
      <li>MORE THING ...</li>
      <li>I am familiar with this kind of product because I use one from Japan.</li>
      <li>I got this for a fairly good price with bunch of free stuff because I told them it was my birthday (true)</li>
      <li>I think the products are pretty good</li>
      <li>To be fair, after I get this gold stuff off my face by double-exfoliating, yes, my skin does seem nice and soft, any signs of acne brewing are calmed, but...  </li>
      <li>At first my skin was bright and smooth.</li>
      <li>my body decided it&#x27;s had enough time being beautiful and that not it&#x27;s time to take care of myself.</li>
      <li>I love this range and can&#x27;t live without !!!!</li>
      <li>I like free stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced the same thing with this peel that a lot of people do where it clumps up in your peach fuzz.  </li>
      <li>Nice , price is high</li>
      <li>but the results on my face were worth it!</li>
      <li>I was mislead by the girls at the store, bought it on Amazon, and was so excited when I got it.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth recommending!</li>
      <li>I love this product, it works, it leaves my skin feeling and looking so clean, I have had so many compliments and questions on what I am using on my face as it is looks so clear and clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>of stuff for about $500 which would be pretty good for high end skin care products.  </li>
      <li>The minimal amount of ingredients in orogold are all top quality ingredients, that are actually good for your face and/or body.</li>
      <li>While may some of this may be true, I have to say that two weeks or so ago, after not using the product for a month, I put it on my clean face and</li>
      <li>I honestly think the 100% nano-gold particles is complete BS.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is true the sales tactics are pushy, but what salesmen aren&#x27;t?</li>
      <li>The wife absolutely Loved Oro Gold Deep Peel.</li>
      <li>so many people and every single one of them is in awe of how effective this product is.</li>
      <li>but not the whole thing nor the best everyday thing for your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to write about their products - First off, I am a 43 year old woman with pretty fair skin and am prone to sun damage/spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Use a good moisturizer afterwards so your skin won&#x27;t dry out.</li>
      <li>Particularly, if they keep offering such discounts :p</li>
      <li>My experience with the OROGOLD store was actually quite amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is really worth its price.</li>
      <li>and I was pretty broke (also true).  </li>
      <li>I do this about every 6 months, when I really need a good deep peel....</li>
      <li>Also as others pointed out, the gel itself is balling up while you scrub making it seem like its actually doing something when at the most, you&#x27;re getting a light exfoliating that leaves flaky skin.</li>
      <li>I kindly told her I was not interested, but she offered to give me the exfoliant and hand cream for free if I paid for the moisturizer.</li>
      <li>They immediately started off with their routines like all salespeople are bred to, but I stopped them right there.</li>
      <li>HANDS DOWN the BEST daily peel you will ever, ever, ever use.  </li>
      <li>The delivery was fast enough and package was nice too.</li>
      <li>We first bought this product in Las Vegas.  </li>
      <li>I got suckered into buying this at a mall kiosk for a hefty discount price, because the salespeople were so convinced that I would come back for more after I&#x27;d seen the results for myself.</li>
      <li>, I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s my skin peeling off, because the color of the substance that peels off is yellowy/gold..like the product!</li>
      <li>The box was pretty and the cream was not allergy for me.</li>
      <li>you need to condider that in the future to have more customers and season</li>
      <li>So, unlike most everyone else on here, I had never seen any of these Oro Gold products before, but I read all the reviews and it sounded like most people were unhappy with their high-end mall kiosk / retail store / Las Vegas demo experience swindling them out of hundreds of dollars, but that they thought the products were amazing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received many positive comments about the effects over the last 8 months of use.</li>
      <li>first few uses, noticing how much more smooth my skin texture was.</li>
      <li>But it was because my skin was as clean as it was going to be, that I had NO dead skin cells on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I cannot believe all of these negative reviews on this absolutely amazing product!</li>
      <li>magnesium ascorbyl phosphate is also a form of C that is studied as having better long term benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>At this time it was easy to find all of these products for about $150-$200 TOTAL from ebay and/or amazon.</li>
      <li>I have large pores and oily skin</li>
      <li>First few days, my skin felt really smooth, like it had been filled in or</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am always skepitcal of buying these items from the pushy sales people in the mall but for some reason I stopped and listend this time. It seemed like this product was amazing and I thought it was actually dirt coming off my skin so I paid the money for it. As I used it a few more times I realized it&#x27;s not the actualy dirt or deadskin it is the beads that are in the gel. I think you can get just as good or even better products for 90% at CVS or Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, it came in a set I purchased. My skin feels nice after. but I wanted to chime in, I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s my skin peeling off, because the color of the substance that peels off is yellowy/gold..like the product! You put it on without water, and it balls up under your fingers when you rub it in...so I think the product itself, not my skin peeling off.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend said I had to try this product. Its a gel with gold flakes in it. As you rub it on your face your dead skin comes off on your fingers. Use a good moisturizer afterwards so your skin won&#x27;t dry out.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial peel I have ever purchased.  Dead skin is removed in seconds.  Non-abrasive.  No irritation.  I recommend to my sisters and friends.</li>
    <li> my wife (thank god) was about to drop $400+ before Christmas at the Oro Gold store at the Irvine Spectrum in CA.  They were VERY pushy to get her to buy some of this stuff, including the eye cream.  Admittedly, the product worked great, i could tell a difference in her wrinkles just from the sample she used at the store.  THANKFULLY we found it on Amazon and we purchased this and the eye creams for like $120 instead of the $500+ she was going to drop at the store without the option to return...  in short, 5 STARS!  thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and I am not surprised that it is in very great demand.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works, it leaves my skin feeling and looking so clean, I have had so many compliments and questions on what I am using on my face as it is looks so clear and clean and smooth.  I have been giving this as gifts to so many people and every single one of them is in awe of how effective this product is.</li>
    <li> I found this product on Amazon when I was looking for the same type of peeling jel made in Japan. I have tried the sample before and I really loved it. A couple of my co-workers noticed the difference of my skin very next day. This product is very expensive, actually 2 to 3 times more expensive than Oro Gold Peel.So, when I found Oro, I was happy about the price and decided to try. The delivery was fast enough and package was nice too. When I opened the tab, I then noticed the difference however. You can barely see gold inside, compared to the Japanese gold peeling jel. And felt the big difference when I finally tried it.  I read so many good reviews about this Oro peeling jel before I decided to buy.  May be it worked for them, but not me.I would have not bought it if a photo of actuall jel was posted since I knew gold would do the trick.</li>
    <li> So, unlike most everyone else on here, I had never seen any of these Oro Gold products before, but I read all the reviews and it sounded like most people were unhappy with their high-end mall kiosk / retail store / Las Vegas demo experience swindling them out of hundreds of dollars, but that they thought the products were amazing.  Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?  I&#x27;ve tried putting on my dry face as the box suggested, rubbing it in, and then rinsing it off.  But it does. not. rinse. off.  No.  It does not scrub off.  It does not come off with a wash cloth.  How do I get it off?  With my regular old St. Ives Apricot Scrub that everyone has used since elementary school and costs like $4 at the drugstore.  I use that stuff all the time, and so also maybe because of my decades of exfoliating, I do not have some thick layers of dead skin that need to be sloughed off.  To be fair, after I get this gold stuff off my face by double-exfoliating, yes, my skin does seem nice and soft, any signs of acne brewing are calmed, but...  I dunno.  I guess I was expecting something that would make me say, \\&quot;Wow! It&#x27;s totally worth buying gold to rub on my face and wash down the drain.\\&quot;  PS - The crazy daily price fluctuations are totally sketchy, too.</li>
    <li> I bought his at the mall for less than it is being sold here but then I really hit the jackpot when I found on amazon Vivo Per Lei&#x27;s facial peel sold by Dead Sea Minerals for $8!!  Vpl&#x27;s version doesn&#x27;t add gold dye but otherwise it&#x27;s the same product. The active ingredient is a chemical exfoliant that will take the top layer off anything, not just skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews that often and when I do, I usually give it time before I bother.  I don&#x27;t like hearing that a product works or doesn&#x27;t work after one or two tests.  I have had this product since late October 2013 and I use it sparingly.  Once a week if not longer between applications.  I use it only when I feel like I need a deep cleanse to get all that damn makeup off or my skin is really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the reviews here, I had to add my two cents.  Many people say that it&#x27;s the product that is being flaked off your skin.  While may some of this may be true, I have to say that two weeks or so ago, after not using the product for a month, I put it on my clean face and no flakes happened what so ever.  I kept rubbing, and I thought to myself that the product had expired, that it was a load of crap.  But it was because my skin was as clean as it was going to be, that I had NO dead skin cells on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product again today because I noticed that some makeup was STILL on my face after washing my face last night and this morning.  I rubbed the deep peel into the affected area and viola, the makeup stuck in my pores flaked up and was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is super expensive and should never, ever be used as a daily routine.  Use it when you need a DEEP PEEL.  It suggests only applying once a week.  If you can go longer, do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I really love this product.  I wil buy it in the future...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: The sales representatives are desperate to sell this stuff.  I got this for a fairly good price with bunch of free stuff because I told them it was my birthday (true) and I was pretty broke (also true).  They will knock the price down for you.</li>
    <li> I got suckered into buying this at a mall kiosk for a hefty discount price, because the salespeople were so convinced that I would come back for more after I&#x27;d seen the results for myself. I&#x27;m currently about three weeks into using it, and I have NEVER seen my skin look so radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne since my early teen years, and this peel has made my skin worlds smoother and more radiant.  I actually left the house without make-up on this weekend for the first time probably ever. Granted, I&#x27;ve never been good about skin care until I started using the product, but it&#x27;s hard to argue that it doesn&#x27;t work since you can actually SEE the dead skin coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive, but I am hooked and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> this product is working for me. I have large pores and oily skin and i feel it is helping my skin. Recommend to people with similar skin. my skin is bright and the pores are closing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Orogold now for a little over one month. When it first arrived I was shocked that no literature or instructions were included. What&#x27;s this? Afraid of legal liability or is just made in a foreign country where it is nearly impossible for their factory to add a label? I was utterly baffled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews (prior to using Orogold), I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t do much for me, as one person stated that they thought the testimonies here were false or made by the owners of Orogold. Well, I&#x27;ve written more than one review on Amazon over the years, so you know my attestation here is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the product I followed one person&#x27;s instructions from one of these reviews and let the gel dry for a bit before rubbing into my skin. That just irritate my skin and barely removed any dead skin from my face. Some people suggested that using Orogold twice a week was safe. However, another person suggested using it every day, or everyday for 2 weeks prior to an important occasion. I tried again the second day, and again, leaving it dry for a little bit resulted again in not much dead skin layers being removed. However, I had used a skin peel from another manufacturer (just a sample) about 2 weeks prior. I decided to wait 3-4 days, giving the every twice a week method a try and OMG! It was like night and day. I added the gel in a moderate amount, wet, massaged immediately, in circles, and there was actually things falling into the sink below. Then I just assumed all 3 times that anything had fallen off could be just the gel itself, like dried glue. As skeptical as I can be, I tried 3 days later, making sure I massaged around my mouth area and hairline which I had not done before, and OMG!- there was so much dead skin that came off those areas compared to the amount that I had already done a few days before. It does work! It makes my skin feel baby soft. However, I would not use it every day. My skin dries out when used 2 days in a row. Make sure you use a heavy moisturizer that night and a day cream the next morning under your makeup, and you&#x27;ll have radiant skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as fading age spots or scars, it hasn&#x27;t made any changes at all for me. I have acne scars from my youth and age spots. But at my age of 53, there may be no hope. Only additional time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I am happy with this product and will order again. I ordered it off of their website at about double the price here, and I will definitely be ordering from Amazon in the future. It&#x27;s been a month and I have so much product left, that I am estimating that it will last about 9 months or more.in a row.

    <li> Great Product....it removes the dead skin off your face. I had no problem using this product and my skin is sensitive.....</li>
    <li> Thought it was a good product first few uses, noticing how much more smooth my skin texture was. However this product seems to half exfoliate my lower cheeks around my jaw area leaving dead flaky skin hanging off which requires some rough scrubbing to remove or painful picking at the tiny flakes of skin to remove. I braved through it for awhile by using a dry face towel to rub in circles over those areas to remove the skin, but after those first few uses noticed no change in my skins texture as a whole. Definitely not worth the money. Also as others pointed out, the gel itself is balling up while you scrub making it seem like its actually doing something when at the most, you&#x27;re getting a light exfoliating that leaves flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I was talked into buying this at the newly opened store at my local mall. The product is a gel exfoliant. I am familiar with this kind of product because I use one from Japan. When the sales lady did the demo on my arm, I was under the impression that it functions the same way as the product I have at home with added bonuses (the gold, which I later did some research on...). The price was WAY too high, especially after she threw in a daytime moisturizer. I kindly told her I was not interested, but she offered to give me the exfoliant and hand cream for free if I paid for the moisturizer. So I went with it. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something new. BOY was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the exfoliant for about a month, once a week like the label said. At first my skin was bright and smooth. A few weeks later, my cheeks were irritated and red and scratched up from the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; in the gel. I honestly think the 100% nano-gold particles is complete BS. It&#x27;s gold colored glitter and it cuts up your skin. I stopped using it immediately and my skin returned to normal after a couple of weeks on m normal skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this stuff...I regret buying it. I cannot even get a refund because they won&#x27;t give it to you.</li>
    <li> arrived on time.  Have used it and it freshens skin w/out burning it.  Good purchase.  Highly recommended for cosmetic cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am medium brown African American in my 50&#x27;s, do not have any signs of crows feet, sagging eyes, deep smile lines, wrinkle neck, no open pores and forehead lines for my age. I received a buy one and get one free and divided the cost with a relative. I used the product that night and was amazed on the noticeable dead skin on my cheeks and under eye area, my forehead, upper and lower nose was not visible of dead skin and my neck area had dead skin. After washing the peel off with cool warm water I was amazed how my face felt very soft and smooth and my under eye dark circles had decrease because of the dead skin buildup. My friends notice my under eyes improvement instantly and asked about wearing under eye makeup. I told them about Oro Gold and gave two people a petite sample and they were amazed of the results. However, it is very expensive and I told them to sign up at the sight to receive notices on special promotions. This will be the only product I will purchase from Oro gold because I have an upscale facial products line of 24k gold eye cream, 24k gold night cream, 24k gold facial serum and diamond moisturizer which cost less than Oro gold and have the same ingredients and/or more natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Best in the market for deep exfoliation and peel!  Lightens dark spots and brings out youthful radiance to my face. I will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> The wife absolutely Loved Oro Gold Deep Peel. I was truly happy because it shipped before Christmas when I was expecting it to ship after Christmas.  Great product...I know because my wife let me try a little. Happy Cleansing!!</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have ever used. Makes my skin feel 20 years younger&amp;#62; I have been using it for a couple of years and Amazon sells it for the best price too.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my mother (she was practically gawking @ the price and the availability since she usually has to go to Vegas to purchase this). She absolutely loves this product and if the seller continues to have this in their store, she will be a repeat customer.    My mother is 49 and has medium/asian skin tone &amp; severly sensitive and oily skin type.</li>
    <li> I just went to the mall  this week and bought the Oro Gold Deep Peel.  Yes it is true that they have very shady sales strategies.  They show you the Oro Gold prices on their tablets and then they tell you that just for today we will give you  the product for half off.  Then they do all these kinds of tactics to combine different products together to give you an overall discount.  First the salesperson said she could only sell me the peel for $110 if I bought some other products.  Then when I said I didn&#x27;t want anything another guy comes over and finally sells me the peel for $70.  So goes to show you that you need to bargain with these people to get a lower price.  If you are offered 50 percent off of retail, then know that is too much to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like the peel and would probably buy it again.  I think the products are pretty good but the marketing strategy is terrible.</li>
    <li> Gimmick. The stuff that peels is the glue like stuff in the ingredients. Just like the stuff they use for demonstrating.</li>
    <li> My experience with the OROGOLD store was actually quite amazing. I had gone to the mall and got suckered into the shop with a free goodie bag that had this single use moisturizing cream. They immediately started off with their routines like all salespeople are bred to, but I stopped them right there. Told them that if they don’t stop “selling” I’m walking out. A distinguished looking female was called out and it was then that I realized that she was their in-house skin expert. Wow. I haven’t seen many of them in beauty stores. Nice touch. Well, I might just forgive them for that whole salesman charade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked what this lady had to say. She was so knowledgeable and talking with her was not about Orogold products but about the skin. It was a nice experience. I don’t remember her mentioning a single product until I asked about what I should be using. Really liked that. Purchased the 24K Deep Peeling along with a few other products that she had recommended and they even gave me a HUGE discount. I even got offered a free facial from OROGOLD the next time I came into their store. That’s nice. I like free stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came back home and used the 24k Deep Peeling the next day. I followed up the product with the 24K Vitamin C Booster Facial Serum as they had suggested. And, am I glad that I met that lady at the store. I would have just walked out otherwise. You really gotta believe me when I tell you this, my skin looked super beautiful. It was like it had suddenly started breathing again. It looked radiant, shiny, glowy, sexy... everything at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temporary effects or permanent beauty, time will tell. But, I am definitely in love with Orogold and their products. Particularly, if they keep offering such discounts :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared my experience with my bestie and even she ordered for a few of their products online. I think she&#x27;s even more crazy about them than I am.</li>
    <li> We first bought this product in Las Vegas.  My wife loves it and even had me get her more when I was in Vegas on business.  Nothing better for face peeling.  Just as good as going to a spa!</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible!  I have very dry skin and this is the only product that gives me the exfoliation I need.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for just over a year , was introduced to it in Las Vegas , in a posh boutique , only did half my face , and bought the full set . With the jet lag skin looked really bad . The oro is really good quality , this peal is so gentle , but very effective , as u will see when u do it over the sink . All the dead skin cells just fall of with a gentle massage , I do a really good skin program,cleans and polish daily . And still amazed how much dead skin comes off . I have told all my friends . I love this range and can&#x27;t live without !!!!</li>
    <li> I use this once a week with the seaweed mask.    between this and the mask.  Works wonders.  It scrubs off the dead skin.</li>
    <li> I have been very curious if the substance that comes off when you rub this in is actually skin or the product.  Is there a way someone could possibly rub a small amount on a surface other than skin to see if they still get the substance that you would get when rubbing on skin.  I am just extremely curious since I am considering buying this for my momma. The salesperson almost had her hooked, but I wanted her to do a little research before buying. It just seems too good to be true.</li>
    <li> This product was very good. The box was pretty and the cream was not allergy for me. My skin was brighten and smoothie.</li>
    <li> Wow! I cannot believe all of these negative reviews on this absolutely amazing product! Yes, it is true the sales tactics are pushy, but what salesmen aren&#x27;t? I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but after reading so many negative reviews about this product, I feel compelled to add my experience, since I have been using it for so long, before anyone even knew what orogold was.... I was talked into buying it while on Vacation in Vegas about 7 years ago, by a very pushy salesman, I said NO because it was too expensive, but he kept pushing, IM GLAD HE DID THOUGH, and spent well over $1000 on everything. Which sucked! I totally felt fooled. But, when I returned home and started using the products I was amazed! My favorites were the Gold deep peel, all day moisturizer, and seaweed and collagen mask for my face. I also use the body scrub and body butter. I dreaded when they ran out because I did not want to pay that price again.... BUT NOW I HAD TO HAVE THEM So I started searching online. At this time it was easy to find all of these products for about $150-$200 TOTAL from ebay and/or amazon. I felt like a fool for paying so much in the beginning but the results on my face were worth it! I have been using these products for the full seven years now, and I swear I have not aged. Gold is a secret that has been used for thousands of years, to keep the wealthy and important young looking. It does work! I am living proof. I am almost 30 years old now, and people still think I am 19/20. I owe it to orogold. I don&#x27;t care about the pushy sales, I am so glad I bought this product and have continued using it all of these years. However, I am sad that is getting more and more difficult to find them at good prices online. I don&#x27;t care though, I will never stop using it, but I will also always try to get the best price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add... with the gold peel.... It is your actual dead skin cells coming off, not the product, like so many seem to be saying. You can prove this toyourself by using it a few days in a row, and you will see less and less skin cells come off with each day of continual use. I do this about every 6 months, when I really need a good deep peel.... I will use it everyday for a few days, until there are no more cells falling off at all. Then I give my face a break for a few weeks If it was just the product, that consistency would not change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE MORE THING ... When choosing any skin care product, especially for your face, the least amount of ingredients, THE BETTER. Most products have a load of ingredients, in them , which is NOT GOOD for your body or face. The minimal amount of ingredients in orogold are all top quality ingredients, that are actually good for your face and/or body. There are no unnecessary ingredients in these products whatsoever. WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO AMAZING. And the gold is what actually stimulates your bodies ability for faster cell renewal. You do not want to buy a product with a bunch of crap in it an than rub it on your face/body! I am sad to see so many turned off by the product by the pushy sales people. Because if you actually used the product there is absolutely NO WAY you could possibly be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice , price is high you need to condider that in the future to have more customers and season offers</li>
    <li> Dont like at all for  what you have to pay for it. If you have any peach fuzz on your face it get all caught in it and takes forever to pick out. Will. Not purchase again</li>
    <li> This product will not come off my skin.  It was sold very coercively at a mall in Salt Lake City.  In spite of the horrible selling techniques, I hoped the product would at least work.  Even if it smooths my skin, there are particles of product which cannot be washed or even scrubbed off.</li>
    <li> I experienced the same hard sell as the rest - my salesman was supposedly French and even went so far as to tell me his life&#x27;s story (getting a divorce, so sad, would I like to go for a drink later).  But it&#x27;s all the same story different chapter as everyone else who&#x27;s reviewed these people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to write about their products - First off, I am a 43 year old woman with pretty fair skin and am prone to sun damage/spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got out of their store with five bottles/tubs/etc. of stuff for about $500 which would be pretty good for high end skin care products.  I got their day moisturizer, eye serum for dark circles, some other eye serum, this deep peel stuff, and their Vitamin C booster.  I started out with one of the eye serums and the Vitamin C stuff.  I used this Gold Deep Peel twice in a week.  First few days, my skin felt really smooth, like it had been filled in or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced the same thing with this peel that a lot of people do where it clumps up in your peach fuzz.  Then I got a nasty looking rash there on my lower cheeks, so I threw that away.  Then I started to notice that the skin around my eyes had visibly AGED - in a week - it looked terrible!  And this was all day long.  My make up no longer went on well, either.  Then I started to notice all kinds of red patches and dark spots coming out on the rest of my face!  I immediately stopped using any of this stuff (after a WEEK) and it&#x27;s taken me about three weeks to get my skin looking normal again (using Aveda Beauty Serum, which really works to calm things down as far as my skin goes if I go and do something stupid like put this Oro Gold crap on my face) and back to the pricier but infinitely more reliable Christian Dior skin care products.  Now my face is back to normal and all is well.</li>
    <li> This product is really worth its price. I was a bit skeptical at first but after using this with the day and night creams, I&#x27;m very impressed with how soft and radiant my skin feels and looks. I&#x27;ve received many positive comments about the effects over the last 8 months of use. Definitely worth recommending!</li>
    <li> Any group that uses such aggressive sales techniques to where you feel swindled and hate yourself for even letting yourself get dragged into their store, has to have MAJOR things wrong with it. Read the other reviews. I made it out of the store after getting dragged in, the sales lady pointed out my blackheads and said at 25 my body decided it&#x27;s had enough time being beautiful and that not it&#x27;s time to take care of myself. Sooo glad I didn&#x27;t but because the product feels like goop and the arm she put it on feels sticky. Be careful walking by them.</li>
    <li> I was mislead by the girls at the store, bought it on Amazon, and was so excited when I got it. Those girls are trained scammers! No difference whatsoever, and Ive been using it since June. Also, many women have said that you see the skin just sluff off... Thats not your skin, dirt etc., its the peel.</li>
    <li> So I am the oil of Olay buy it at target minimal beauty routine type.  Purchased a set of Oro products from the kiosk in SF. (Note) shady sales practices, but I knew I could walk away at any time.  Any way, now that I am 39 and mother of two I  have become a bit self conscious about my  aging skin.  Here&#x27;s what I  got and here&#x27;s my experience and here&#x27;s what I found out through research on the active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Deep peel&lt;br /&gt;Day time lotion&lt;br /&gt;Face wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that the peel would last me a year and the lotion and the face wash 6 months.  The products did change the texture of my skin but it also made it feel irritated a bit, not red but something I figured I might have to alternate with my normal skin care products.  My husband tried out the peel too, he thinks he would need more try&#x27;s before passing judgment.  All of the three products have ascorbic acid the peel having the highest concentration. Well... Ascorbic acid is the peeling agent, it is used in. Lots of other beauty products and peels and is not by any means expensive.  Now they tout it as vitamin C, but that&#x27;s not really true, it is part of the complex that makes up the vitamin but not the whole thing nor the best everyday thing for your skin. Nor is their vitamin E, really E....but I digress. There is another good for you product that uses the NIH trial tested isolate of the vitamin C that has been shown to make a real difference in your skin and surprise it not really that expensive. magnesium ascorbyl phosphate is also a form of C that is studied as having better long term benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using up my expensive purchase in its pretty packaging, but will not feel the need to buy it again.  I hope this helps someone who is thinking of buying it either online on in store.</li>
    <li> I would be prefer to use a cheaper brand that works the same. What I found for this product is that it seems to slough off some skin but I found on the sides of my face I had to actually loufah the product off my face because it didn&#x27;t melt off and left bits on the side of my face.</li>
    <li> Love my skin not sure it really peels or is just product material that comes off in chunks first bought in Las Vegas at 2x cost found here. I do no think I can be without it. Use weekly</li>
    <li> HANDS DOWN the BEST daily peel you will ever, ever, ever use.  I LIVE for this product.</li>
    <li> I use the Gold Deep Peel once a week. I have used similar products but they were grainy,felt rough and irritated my skin. Orogold is different it really works and feels like silk on my skin. It exfoliates the skin gently and without irritation revealing younger, healthier skin that looks hydrated and has fewer fine lines. It is also gentle enough to use around the eye area which is a definate no no with most other exfoliaters. I love it!!!</li>
