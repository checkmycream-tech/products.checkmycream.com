<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very sensitive, reactive, allergic, rosacea skin. Have to be really careful of what I use on it. Several years ago, I gave up using chemicals to moisturize and only use oils. A few years ago, my skin was dry, red and chapped looking from the harsh, dry winter and the heat being on in the house. I used Tamanu Oil a few times a day. It healed my skin. It looked it&#x27;s usual &amp;#34;rosy&amp;#34; self; however, it didn&#x27;t look as if it hurt. I continue to use Tamanu Oil whenever my skin looks or feels like it&#x27;s having an issue. And that can be several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pur 365 comes in a serum pump bottle. A really nice way to receive it. Much easier to use then an eye dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I was shocked to see a proviso about the scent of the oil. Didn&#x27;t read other reviews, but they mentioned that people felt the scent is strong. I LOVE the scent of Tamanu Oil. It&#x27;s very nutty smelling, but I like nuts. Even if I found the smell unpleasant, I would be willing to use it because I know how healing it is. I recently made a &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; butter for a friend to use for stretch marks. I doubled the amount of Tamanu Oil called for in the recipe because I know how good it is. Another time I use it is when I have to shovel snow. And in the NE, we&#x27;ve had to shovel A LOT of snow the last few yeas. I put a few drops on my face and I know it is protected from the elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; issues, this is a great oil and I encourage you to buy it.</li>
    <li> Pur365 Tamanu oil is amazing stuff! I will warn you some people worry about the smell...it&#x27;s not that bad just kind of earthy. But hey it&#x27;s not perfume...it&#x27;s a healing miracle!!! I was given a discount to try this product and review and I love this stuff! It heals and heals fast. Best part? It&#x27;s a natural product that works.</li>
    <li> This is considered a wonder oil and I have heard many many good things about Tamanu oil. I got to purchase this oil for a reduced price in exchange of my reviews and am completely satisfied with this brand. So much that once I finish this bottle I am going to buy another bottle of this same brand. I have lots of acne scars on my face. I use this oil to massage my scars at night and leave it on. The oil is on the greasier side so is best applied at night. The smell is strong but not to bothering at all. You get used to it after some time. I am yet to see the effect on scars as it will take at least one month to see any changes as my scars are too old. But my face is no more dry and scaly ,rough and itchy. This oil acts as a conditioner for my face. In the morning I can&#x27;t avoid touching my face because after many years my face feels smooth and nourished. I will update my review after a couple months if I see any major change in my scars which I am sincerely hoping will diminish with it.</li>
    <li> ETA:  I believe that this is a more refined Tamanu oil.  One of my suppliers sells both this kind and the thick green oil.  Apparently this more refined oil is excellent for a lot of skin conditions but not as anti-microbial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu is definitely one of my top five natural skin remedies.  Even my mother, who is not as into natural products, has been sold on tamanu after a few visits to my house where she had various sores and skin conditions and a burn that needed attending. Sometimes she had already been treating the area for a while before she got here, and one night with tamanu would do more than the prior week had to heal it. Tamanu is useful for so many things and can often substitute for bacitracin as a milder but still powerful anti microbial with inherent healing properties that petroleum lacks.  I include tamanu oil in several products in my etsy shop (DJ Deodorants &amp; Diapersticks--in the deodorants, the diaper rash treatment and prevention sticks, and the toe gout roll ons). I have previously bought tamanu from Aura Cacia and several times from Mountain Rose Herbs.  This PUR365 Tamanu is notably thinner and less green than my Mountain Rose Herbs tamanu.  Tamanu does vary in color across the green and brown spectrum.  As for the thinness, that could be a result of either a more refined style of processing or a difference in age (although I&#x27;m quite sure my Mountain Rose Herbs tamanu arrives thicker than this; I cannot recall the consistency of my Aura Cacia tamanu, just that it was very green).  Since I had some cracked skin around a couple of knuckles when this arrived, I used it on the cracked area, and it seemed to have all of the properties that I traditionally associate with tamanu.  I love the use of pump tops for these powerful sorts of carrier oils.  It allows you to easily grab them from your medicine cabinet for various issues without worrying about spilling some in the middle of the night.  All tamanu has an earthy scent similar to rosehip oil but stronger than most other carrier oils.

I was fortunate to receive my PUR365 tamanu at a discount in exchange for leaving an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Cleared some skin irritation I had right up. This is a must have in anyone’s essential oil’s collection. I would give it 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> This is very nourishing without being too oily. I’ve found it to be great on acne scars. I’ve also used it on my stretch marks and have seen some great improvements.</li>
    <li> I got this for a bad acne scar that was giving me a lot of trouble. Seeing a great amount of improvement already. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice oil, Received today and was very happy to apply it! I have been trimming my rose bushes and let me tell yiou they got the best of me. This oil seemed to relieve the redness and stinging of the scratches.</li>
    <li> Pur365 Tamanu Oil  is incredibly moisturizing, anti-inflammatory and soothing. For those that have acne prone skin this will actually work to heal breakouts and prevent new ones from resurfacing, while still providing your skin with what it needs. I was provided with this tamanu oil at a discounted rate in exchange for my review and I must say Pur365 Tamanu oil does not make your skin oily. It actually can make it a bit dry however it works wonders on scarring and marks. I find that it heals  existing acne. I mix it with coconut oil or  vitamin E or Jojoba oil. I only use a few drops for my entire face. I put it on at night because it does not work well under makeup, at least for me. I find my skin is glowing and it won&#x27;t clog your pores. I also found that Tamanu oil particularly good for my eczema. I suffer from it on my hands. It relieves dryness and encourages healing. Sample provided at a discounted rate in exchange for my review.</li>
    <li> Love this. So many uses and seeing improvements in my skin already.</li>
    <li> OILS are sooo amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff! No other oil like it!</li>
    <li> I am really surprised that I had not heard of Tamanu oil before. I have been into essential oils for a little while now, and everyone talks about the basics. The lavender, the lemon, tea tree etc. While these oils are great, no one ever once has mentioned what Tamanu oil and what it does for the body. I was very happy to do a little research and found out that it helps greatly for psoriasis, eczema and other skin issues that are in our household. I just placed a few drops in some coconut oil and rubbed it in like you would a normal lotion. My daughter has stopped scratching at her eczema and the family member who has psoriasis says it feels so much softer and less scaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
    <li> The at the start the Tamanu oil smells like raw Shea butter... I used it on my hands and after wards the smell went away. The oil left my hand soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again. Also its one of the few oils that has pump which is very handy. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit new to the world of essential oils but my friends are big into it and of course they dragged me into it as well, so we all get together and compare and make blends for each other and talk about brands and the best company for each oil.I had never used PUR 365 oils before but one of my friends raved about the tamanu oil she purchased from them and so when the time came for me to add it to my collection, I turned to PUR 365 as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed. It arrived in an attractive glass bottle with professional and comprehensive labeling and a press-and-spritz top for easy use. Although I myself cannot smell, I let one of my knowledgeable friends take a look at it and she thought it had a dark, woodsy, slightly spicy scent and she was really impressed by the quality. We&#x27;ve already used it as a carrier for several other projects and the bottle should last a very long time. Overall, very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount in exchange for a genuine critique.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizer! Better than any oil I&#x27;ve used thus far. Will definitely purchase more soon.</li>
    <li> I did notice my skin smoother after days of using. Works just as described. I liked it so much I bought a bottle for a friend of mine!</li>
    <li> I’ve used this oil for a few weeks now and I really like it! There aren’t any artificial ingredients like dyes or perfumes so its super gentle on the skin. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin super soft. I use it about 2 or 3 times a day - morning and at night.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this on my face and already seeing huge improvements. Makes my skin super soft and also adds a really nice shine to my hair. You don’t need much so it lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great essential oil, and will be a part of my skin routine from now on. It also does wonders soothing mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> Tamanu oil is well known for being a miracle skin healer. I was doubtful at first as my stretch marks did not seem to improve after using it daily for a few days. However, after more than a week, I can finally see that my stretch marks have lightened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pur365 tamanu oil is usda organic certified. This is another plus for me. A lot of other tamanu oils on Amazon claim to be organic on their labels but they do not have any certification to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is green and smells strongly nutty. The scent grows on you after awhile. A little goes a long way. The pump dispenses just the right amount. The oil absorbs well onto my skin leaving no greasy feeling. My stomach feels moisturised even after a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd replacement bottle as the first one had a problem. There was no similar issue with this 2nd bottle and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> termini oil. I have been using this for about a week. I cannot be happier with the results on my belly. Two babies later, my belly finally does not look like a world map. :) i love this comes in a spray bottle and all i need to do is to rub it and don&#x27;t need to pour it out as pouring oil out most usually means it will be spilled somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** i received this with a discount to provide my honest feedback.</li>
