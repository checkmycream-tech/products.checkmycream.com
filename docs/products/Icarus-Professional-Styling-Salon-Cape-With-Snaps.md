<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works but small hairs got stuck on the material.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, good price</li>
    <li> Hair still goes through this.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected  great product will be ordering more in the future</li>
    <li> This works great. I cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home so I didn&#x27;t need anything too fancy. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> Happy with it, nothing really special, I cut my children&#x27;s hair and this helps to keep it off their clothes (which I dislike).  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, when I am done, I just shake the hair off, fold it up until its time to use again.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I hoped.  Product has met my expectations.  Would consider purchasing again from this merchant.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Thin, keeps the hair and water away, and best of all cheap! Will buy more when I need more.</li>
    <li> Good enough for my wife Salon.</li>
    <li> Got the perfect bang for my buck! I think this cap is going to be able to last a while! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thick nylon, definitely a value. I recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to wash.</li>
    <li> This product works well to protect the clothes of our clients during treatments. It washes easily and looks nice. I would purchase another.</li>
    <li> Outstanding service. Wonderful quality item</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
    <li> Better than the $20 cape from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Good quality and it looks like it will last a long time.  I love it BUT I&#x27;ll only be using it periodically and certainly not every day.</li>
    <li> Great value, good quality, like the snaps for various fit.  Overlaps in back and good size for adult male.</li>
    <li> Great cape :)  I used it for my sons 6 and 9 and no hair got on them.  They were happy :)</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price</li>
    <li> I love this cape. I cut my own hair. This cape keeps the messy hair clippings from coming into contact with my skin. Essentially, it makes self hair cutting more fun. The price is great too. I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> Works for exactly what we need it for. Haircuts :)</li>
    <li> The cape is generously sized and covers well and is similar thickness to the other cape I have for kids. The neck has enough snaps to work on both kids and adults. There were still a few more smaller adjustments when used on an 8 year old so I would imagine you could use this for some pretty young children. The only issue I had with the cape is that it did not protect against water. When spraying a light mist on the cape the moisture went right through and with my older cape the water did not penetrate. The cape will work well for clipping boy’s hair when there is little water involved; however, if water is used I would look for another product.</li>
    <li> This light weight cape gives you the option of multi configurations! It is super easy to clean and very potable! Makes a great addition to any on the go kit!</li>
    <li> You can never have enough capes. This one is light and slick. It&#x27;s perfect for styling and washing. I only use snap secure capes, which this is nice to have. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good quality and covers a lot of area</li>
    <li> Works great, good quality.</li>
    <li> Looks like a great cape.</li>
    <li> I received this through the salon guys and really like this cape.  It is great for home use of dying your hair and really stays on well and is comfortable.  It feels like I am in a salon when I use the cape.  It is durable and washable which is a plus!  Snaps are great as well.</li>
    <li> this cape is light weight, snaps are good and the size is excellent.  It does it&#x27;s job and does it well.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a part of the market research with Salon Guys.  As someone who grew up in a hair salon, I know how important it is to have a cape you can trust.  This cape has a slight sheen to it, without making it look cheap.  The snap button enclosures around the neck are simple and unfussy.  There is also a small notch at the neck so that you can hang this from a hook, if necessary.  While I didn&#x27;t have a reason to cut my hair to test out the product, I did test it in other ways and found that wet hair did not stick to the material.  The back of the cape is shorter than I like, but not out of the ordinary for a typical cape.</li>
    <li> This cape works for everyone from my two year old to my husband and of course me when im dying my hair now that I have it I don&#x27;thave to use those towels and it has an adjustable velcro collar. It&#x27;s light enough to not be too hot, but still sturdy enough to last and packs away for convenient storage.the price very affordable I love it plus I got it free thank you salon guys..</li>
    <li> It Works great. I do all the family hair cuts at home and nobody else complains about hair in their clothes.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Professional Black Nylon Hair Styling Salon Cape with Snaps. First off let me say that I am not a professional hair dresser. I am fortunate to be part of the Salon Guys research program and I received this product free of charge from Salon Guys in exchange for my honest opinion. This cape is lightweight and comfortable. There are small plastic snaps at the neck that  allow for an adjustable fit. It is much shorter in the back than in the front. The only reason I noticed this is because I have long hair and since I&#x27;m not a hairdresser, i wouldn&#x27;t be seated in a chair when using this product. Why do I mention this? Because if I were using this to protect my clothing, anything wet that was on my hair, would also be on the back of my shirt below where the cape ends. If the person wearing the cape is seated,  or if the person using this at home has short to medium length hair,this probably wouldn&#x27;t be an issue, .</li>
    <li> Light weight, wasn&#x27;t hot like some other capes.  I took it with to my hairstylist to get her opinion and her only complaint is it was somewhat short in the back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used a towel when dying my hair but now that I have this, I don&#x27;t have to waste a towel! I love it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using the black nylon styling cape! It&#x27;s been so useful to me in styling and cutting hair. I really love the variety of sizes for the neck part of the cape. There are several different sizes in which you can set the cape at, which is very useful for if I&#x27;m doing a child&#x27;s hair compared to an adult. The nylon material allows the hair to slide right off, leaving little clean up for me. The nylon material is also very comfortable for the patient, it is light-weight and smooth so they won&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on! I am extremely satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I liked so much ,very good cuality</li>
    <li> This salon cape felt really nice to the touch, it had a nice weight to it.  It’s the type of cape a stylist would use when styling your hair, as opposed to washing it.  It will protect you from a small amount of water, but the primary use should be for hair cutting and styling.  There are six snaps on the cape, so that works really well for various sizes of people; it would fit a small child or large man nicely.  When wearing it, it has a comfortable, flexible feel to it and it covers enough of your body that you won’t have to worry about messing up your clothes while getting your hair done.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cape that seems like it would fit anyone.  The snaps work well to secure the cape.  The material is water repellent so you can spray mist without it seeping through and it is smooth so hair comes of with a light shake.  I haven’t tried washing it yet but it appears it will machine wash just fine.  For the price you can’t go wrong.  It is nicer than some of the capes that are used in salons.  Remember the price.  This isn’t an expensive cape so yes it is that nice because you have to consider what you pay.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my sister as a gift because she dyes her hair very often herself and is always getting the dye on her clothes. After she used it, she thanked me profusely. The snap closures were great for keeping the cape in place and it was so lightweight that she didn’t feel like she was wearing anything. For the first time in a long time she has not gotten any dye on her clothes and she really appreciates it. And I really appreciate that I don’t have to hear her complain about any sort of mess! Nice product.</li>
    <li> This cape is very very thin. It is not a cape that you can shampoo a client in at all. It is great if you have clients that have hot flashes as other capes really hold the heat in so it is great for that purpose.  Also, the fact that it has snaps is great for a good fit around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;Paula -  Wisconsin</li>
    <li> This cape is a great price and works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s soft and comfortable for either customers in a salon or at home for family or self. The snaps hold nicely and have different placements for size. It&#x27;s not heavy, it&#x27;s lightweight yet protects clothing and body while keeps water / hair products / hair clippings off. Also easy to clean and store. I give my husband regular edge-ups and this has worked great to catch his hair from his clothing and neck/body. I also trim my one year old&#x27;s hair and he thinks it&#x27;s fun to wear a professional cape! When I color my own hair this will protect my clothes and provide a nice backdrop to see the hair that is already colored against the dark black material. I will be using this cape for several projects and would recommend.</li>
    <li> This cape is very durable and soft. It&#x27;s very light and airy. The snaps make it easy to get on and stay I would recommend this cape to people.</li>
    <li> I have given this cape a rating of three stars because it does not seem to be very multipurpose.  It&#x27;s great to use for dry or slightly damp hair to keep hair or other hair product off of skin and clothes, but for wet hair it does very little.  With freshly shampooed hair water too easily soaks right through this cape defeating much of the purpose; sure it will keep hair and product off but the person you&#x27;re working on will be wet and uncomfortable where the water soaks through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cape is great if you deal mainly with dry haircuts or style hair mostly dry.  It&#x27;s absolutely phenomenal for that and will keep serums, mousse, gels, and/or hairspray from getting all over your client while styling their hair.  If you&#x27;re cutting the fabric will cause the dry hair to easily glide off and onto the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet hair, as I mentioned above soaks through this cape in no time flat.  There seems to be little to no water resistant aspect to this cape.  As such if you do mainly wet cuts or want something to keep the water of your client while blow drying their hair this is not the cape for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snaps and the spacing between the snaps make it great to size and fit to people from children to large adults so no complaints there.  The neck itself is very comfortable as it doesn&#x27;t seem to dig or bite into the neck, unless of course you have it fitted too tightly, but that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue because the snaps are spaced well enough that you should be able to find a good fit for anyone you&#x27;re working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cape as part of a product review program so I can&#x27;t really be disappointed in how this cape performs.  My final thoughts on this cape would be that if you work mainly with dry to only slightly damp hair it is a good value for the money spent, otherwise if you work more with wetter hair purchase a different cape that&#x27;s more water resistant.</li>
    <li> I love this hair cutting cape! The first thing that I love about this, is that the fabric is a nice quality. The nylon fabric is better than some of the plastic capes that I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a breathable fabric that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone that wants to create a professional haircut feel. Secondly, another great feature about this haircut cape is that it has an adjustable neck. The simple buttons snap into place where you need them. This is beneficial over the velcro cape that I used to have because the hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the velcro. I have no concerns about this cape.</li>
    <li> This cape has great coverage for the front but is a little short in the back for those taller clients. I like for my capes to completely cover the entire back of my client so there will be no hair built up on the chair that could slip on the client if they leaned forward a little bit. The material is pretty good and allows for the client to stay cool while getting styled.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! I grew up in the Salons working with my mom because she was a Cosmetologist and this cape by far is awesome!! It covers your whole chair and body not leaving room to get any hair or other products on your clothing.  It appears to be durable and easy to snap on.</li>
    <li> I received this through the product review program. I tried it out and I am very pleased with this product, It&#x27;s lightweight, is not hot, has a snap closure, and is also quite long. My favorite part about this item is that it does not allow wet hair to stick to it; It just slides right off. It&#x27;s fairly priced, affordable and doesn&#x27;t seem to be a cheaply made product. It has made my life easier, the only part that I cannot state is how it holds up to hair dye. I personally didn&#x27;t try it for that yet, so I cannot say one way or the other about it in regards to that.</li>
    <li> This product is great for keeping hair off of you for a haircut. The nylon is very slick and allows for the hair to slide right off and reduces the risk of feeling itchy after having your hair cut. I would recommend this product to anyone who works in a salon or has their hair cut at home. The nylon material is pretty water proof as well, which is nice in case you get some water on your client. The price for this item is very reasonable as well, with fast shipping. This product would be perfect for small or mid-size salons.</li>
    <li> I liked that the neck line snaps shut and stays shut and keeps falling hair completely off of the neck--which is a very good thing. Part of its secret is that it Provides a snug fit and then the light weight material covered my customer&#x27;s clothes completely. I don&#x27;t think it would work well for shampoo cape but for styling it&#x27;s great. I would order a few more.</li>
    <li> This salon cape works great, it&#x27;s lightweight but is still large enough to cover all of your clothes to avoid any damage from coloring or bleaching your hair. There is also a hook on the inside for easy hanging when not in use without slipping off of shelves or hangers. I would definitely recommend this to salon professionals or those who color their hair at home!</li>
    <li> I received this cape from SalonGuys as part of their market research program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cape is very lightweight material. One person I used the cape on loved it, because she usually gets very hot under a thicker one. It does resist water, but only briefly; if you wipe it off right away it&#x27;s fine, but it is not a waterproof cape. Both for shampooing and coloring, I prefer a thicker cape that is waterproof so there is no chance for water or any drips of color to soak through. But this cape is ideal for clients that tend to get hot under a thick cape and for haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cape is a nice size, almost 4 feet from front of neck to hem and less than a foot in back. The neck has a good sizing range with snaps spaced well to be able to fit from a child&#x27;s neck to a large adult&#x27;s, even with a towel wrapped around, which I had to do to shampoo since the cape would have been soaked. The snaps are plastic, but seem to be well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cape is fairly slick, and hair does not stick to it but slides right off. Because it is thin it also lays very flat against the neck and shoulders without having to clip down the tab or extra fabric. My overall decision on this cape is that it is of reasonable quality for the price, and that I will be using it for haircuts only.</li>
    <li> This cape is nice! I had recently signed up for a Market Research Program and this was one of the things they sent me. I like that it is black because it makes it more versatile to use on all of my clients. The material used is a nylon and it is water proof. Don&#x27;t get me wrong if you fully submerse it in water it will get wet but that is how you wash it. It cleans easily, and fits well on everyone, children and adults. The button snaps blend in and are plastic so you won&#x27;t have rusty metal after a long period of time and use. I can&#x27;t get over the soft texture. I have had many capes but this one is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a great cape that can be used for many different uses.  It is the perfect solution for protecting both your clothes and neck from products.  Using this cape for hair cuts is a perfect solution for keeping small/large clippings off of you.  It is light weight and fits comfortably.</li>
    <li> This styling cape is extremely light weight and breathable. It is great to keep clients cool, while cutting or styling their hair. I love the way the oversize of the cape to protect the clients clothes from getting hair all over them. I was worried when I got the cape that with it being shear that hair will stick to the cape but the material doesn&#x27;t let hair stick to the cape. It has several snaps so you can adjust it to fit around the clients neck. One thing I noticed is that my clients who have larger necks, it worried me that I may not be able to snap the cape. I also love that it has a loop in center of the neck line inside to wear I can hang the cap up and not have to worry about it slipping off the hook!! :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hairdresser but am fortunate enough to assist Salon Guys with their product review program.  Upon receiving this, I noticed how lightweight it was...much lighter than the one my hairdresser used last week.  It&#x27;s also very long.  The snaps seem a bit cheap though.  Overall, I wonder how well this would hold up for haircolor treatments.  In other words, would the color dripping onto it go through to the client&#x27;s clothing?  This appears to be more of a use-a-few-times and throw away because it&#x27;s so thin. It is water repellant so that is something good it has going for it.</li>
    <li> Its a thin Cape, perfect for Haircuts, love the snaps verses velcro.  Great price</li>
    <li> fast delivery good stuff</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised!</li>
    <li> This cape is great! It&#x27;s very lightweight and keeps the client from getting hot and sweaty underneath. Sounds gross, but, if you stick your client under a super heavy plastic cape, chances are, they will get very hot. The clasps are snaps and seem very steady. Sometimes the hair gets stuck to the cape.</li>
    <li> These capes are awesome. The price is unbeatable!!!!! They snap, they fit bigger clients and small clients necks. They are light weight and great for color and cuts. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I needed a cape to use when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair, and bought this one based on specifications and good reviews. There is no picture of the back, however, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to not fully cover the back like it does in the front. My husbands fine hairs gets all over, and I was hoping to have his back fully covered.</li>
    <li> This cape was nice. I like how sturdy the snaps were. There are multiple options for different sizes. This allows a certain level of comfort for different individuals when the cape is placed around the neck area. It is kind of thin but I use it to protect my clothing from hair clippings. I feel like it would protect against liquid. The nylon material was soft. The cape is also really big.</li>
    <li> The Professional nylon cape for hair styling is ok for home use.  If I were a hairdresser at a salon, I would not use this on my clients.  It is thin and not water proof.  I used the cape to dye my hair to prevent the hair dye from going on my skin.  It is a little too large for me and the arms were very awkward as they are not a sewn together.  It does wash clean, no staining except I did get hair dye on my skin, as the back has no coverage.  It does have more than enough snaps to choose the neck size but not fitted anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;An attached belt might work to make it more fitting.</li>
    <li> This cape is perfect to fold up and store when not in use.  It is feather-light, so it folds up to practically flat and it easy to store.  I have used it when I cut my kids hair at home.  It keeps the hair off their necks and the water that I spritz off their clothes.  The size is generous and covers all that it needs to, as it is very long (especially on children).  I love that it is machine washable, as we have even ventured to use it as an art smock as well!  Versatility is definitely an added bonus.  The snaps are easy to fasten even for a child.  I would definitely order more of these capes.</li>
    <li> I found the Professional Black Nylon Hair Styling Salon Cape with snaps to be adequately acceptable.  It offers full coverage with a wide array of adjustable snaps.  I did appreciate the option of a close fitting closer due to the positioning of the snaps.  That allows for an acceptable functionality.  This Black Nylon Hair Styling Salon Cape is very light weight, which should be a positive in warm weather or a warm salon environment.  It doesn&#x27;t have a soft silky feel of other capes.  Hopefully this light weight nylon will allow for an aggressive pricing structure, which would override  any other concerns.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  The cape is thick and looks like it will stand up even to its intended use of cutting kids hair and their near constant movement.  The snaps for the neck went small enough for my 2 year old and had one smaller setting left.  It was long and draped on the floor for his haircut but looks long enough for adult use.</li>
    <li> Cheap, doesn&#x27;t go all the way around client.</li>
    <li> I just received this cape and it is alright. The snaps around the neck are positioned really great. I have a small neck so I understand the pain of not having the cape fit right. This cape has a good design for having a broad range of neck size possibilities. It could be used on children and grown larger men. The thing I don&#x27;t like about this cape is that it is not water proof or even water resistant. and spray of water will soak right through so I am not wanting to use this with chemicals at all; however it will be a great hair cutting and styling cape because it is slick and the hair wont stick to it as it is cut and falls.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Fits everyone from my grandkids to my big and tall husband.</li>
    <li> I have colored my own hair (and clothes) for years.  With the smooth, secure snaps, this cape fits great over my clothes, now only my hair gets color!  It&#x27;s design makes it easy to move while providing complete coverage.  The nylon contributes to an easy clean up and cleans up very easily.  I just throw it in the wash and it&#x27;s ready for the next time.</li>
    <li> The snaps around the neck work well and this is easy to put on. The thin material has a static issue so the hairs tend to stick to it. I sprayed it with anti-static spray which seems to help. For the price, it is okay for the monthly hair trimming but would have preferred heavier material. If you are looking for something substantial, this is not it.</li>
    <li> I love my cape! Very nicely made and I love the fact that it has the snaps and not velcro. The nylon material definitely makes the hair slide easily to the floor and away from your clothes. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great. Made me want to wear it, and only it, while dancing with no shoes on.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs! Prompt delivery!!</li>
    <li> This is a great cape! Lightweight ao it isnt hot,  but keeps the hair off the client!</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!!!!! Wish I had thought of this to wear when I put makeup on years ago, would have saved my clothes from getting messy a long time ago.</li>
    <li> These salon caps are hard to beat!  They are durable, made nicely and do not fray in the edges. These salon capes resist water and bead up, instead water just rolls off. The color is perfect. The salon capes are perfect for all clients and adjust nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and efficient. The packaging was great with no damage at all. I would buy from this seller again and also would but more capes also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is I might like to have more color choices and/or design s as clients would enjoy that, choosing their own colored cape. I will look this seller up for other options and merchandise they may have that I would want. Price was reasonable and had no problem spending the money.</li>
    <li> Works great love the snaps. Use for at home hai cuts</li>
    <li> Does just what it should! Perfect addition to a pair of Wahl clippers for home hair cutting.</li>
    <li> This cape doesn’t get so warm do to that it’s light and thin. It’s Easy to wash and dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for cutting my husband’s hair that’s very long (about  29 inch). I put it backwards and had him stand up, because the cape is quite short in the back, that worked fine, didn’t get any hair on his clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using it for coloring hair with less success. It’s not waterproofed. It didn’t get stained by the hair color and was easy to wash afterwards. But the hair color did go thru the cape.&lt;br /&gt;I’m only giving this cape 3 stars because it’s not waterproofed, doesn’t fit for coloring hair. Short in the back.</li>
    <li> This is a professional, salon-quality styling cape. I use it for hair cutting and it gets the job done. What is great about this particular cape is the soft material. It has not stained and the material remains soft after wash and wear.  You can either wipe is clean or wash it in a washing machine. This cape is also great because it is a long size. Sometimes styling capes are too short in length. This styling cape will last a very long time because it is made with quality material. If I ever need to stock up on these capes, I will not hesitate to order more!</li>
    <li> This cape is what it says it is - it is a styling cape (not for shampooing or wet services.) It is nice and lightweight and large enough to comfortably cover your client during a haircut. The closure is little snaps, (which is great because some other capes have Velcro closure which while that gives you a little more flexibility it can easily get caught on and pull the hair.) It is all in the small details - another great thing about this cape is that it has a little loop by the neck so that you can hang it from a hook should you choose to do so. I&#x27;m really happy that Salon Guys sent this out to me for me to review because all in all it is a great quality item.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Not good. Dry cutting only.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cape to keep me clean when my wife cuts my hair. It does what I want, and it was an excellent price. It closes with snaps at the neck. I am not sure how durable the snaps will be, but it should hold up for monthly use. The only negative is that it has so much static that it is impossible to get the hair off the cape. I tried vigorous shaking and a vacuum. ... I will try washing it next.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight. Hair doesn&#x27;t stick. Snaps work fine and fits around the neck Ok for my young kids age 3+. I had originally purchased a different cape from Amazon that said it was velcro, but came with metal clips. I&#x27;m glad I returned that puchase as this cape seems to work better. It could have been a little longer in the back (as I drape the back over a chair so the hair falls to the floor) , but still performs Ok.  10-08-15 Update. This is still working good and I would purchase this product again. I have not tried to wash it yet, as I just shake it out.</li>
    <li> As described, like salon capes.  Perfect for trimming family member&#x27;s hair in between salon visits. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this cape from SalonGuys as part of their market research program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how long this cape is and how slick it is.  The hair can slide right off and it fully can cover someones lap when they are sitting down for the haircut.  The snaps are very good and fit different neck sizes.  It does not poke you like velcro does or itch either.  It is very thin which I like because I don&#x27;t feel too hot when I use it since it goes over my clothes.  It is not waterproof so if it gets water on it, you should wipe it off promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do like this cape a lot and will use it on all my family members when I do their hair.  I use hair clippers on my husband and my son&#x27;s hair and scissors and hair color on my daughters, this cape works good for both.  recommend the cape and this seller for this product and many others.</li>
    <li> Very adequate coverage but very lightweight.  This cape is designed for gentle use and would be great for students or even for home use.  For busy salon use life expectancy would be shorter than a deluxe cape but would do the job.</li>
    <li> My old styling cape did not have snaps at the neck and I had to use clips to keep it shut.  This cape has snaps that work well but they are plastic (not metal) so I do not know how long they will perform.  In any case having these snaps is better than what I had previously- no snaps.  It works as intended.  I like the loop inside the cape because it is easier to hang it up on a hook or hanger.  If you are looking for a very thick cape, do not purchase this.  It has a decent weight but it is not thick.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this when coloring her hair.  it definitely keeps the color from getting on her clothes and causing permanent stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very light weight.  It also seems to be very durable and well made.  I also used it when trimming my own hair to keep the hair off my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fasteners are a breeze to use and are well made they are not metal so there are no rust or corrosion concerns. .  The cape provides adequate coverage for a small 5ft 3 inch woman to a large 6 ft 225 pound man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also arrived very quickly and well packaged.  I believe It was received within 2 Business days.</li>
    <li> This is the type of cutting cape you could buy in bulk! Great all purpose cape for every type of client. Nice plastic snap closures that are placed for great fit on kids and grow ups. The material dries fast and washes up well. I was sent this cape for review by Salon Guys.</li>
    <li> I really like this cape for dying my hair. I think we all have that old shirt and shorts we use, but this works perfectly for this chore! I like the material that is used for this cape because it&#x27;s silky and soft. I really enjoy how the company who made this product leaves a little card in the package about how you can style the cape such as &amp;#34;big shirt&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;kimono&amp;#34; I think that that is very creative. I personally will not be using the cape for anything other than dying my hair but I think that the fact that the company took time to create that card showing other ways is really creative and cool.</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because I gave it to my cousin who cuts hair. It fit well and it was long enough to cover the body so there was no mess. The material was great and it seems like this would last a long time, my cousin is holding on to this to use on future clients :)</li>
    <li> Material is excellent and the cape provides excellent coverage from the hair trimmings.  Definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional but this cape has done wonders for my at home use. I cut my friends hair as well as my own and this cape eliminates the mess of trimmings as well as it is comfortable. The snap closure allows for a secure fit and the material of cape is soft and comfortable on skin. All in all great product!</li>
    <li> Quality is good. Don&#x27;t like that it is short in the back and it has buttons on the neck.</li>
    <li> Works well and so far durable</li>
    <li> Great product; I would order from this seller again</li>
    <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose ok, and it was super cheap, but you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> My customers are very comfortable with this cape, it is soft and weightless. very good quality for a low price. easy to clean. will order more for the business.</li>
    <li> Really this product. It&#x27;s like being in a professional salon in your own home.  Is very easy to dispose the hair clippings.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great cape for the price. It&#x27;s lightweight, a decent size and has snaps, which I much prefer over velcro.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to learn how to cut hair and i had bought evrythingexceept the cape, then i came across this one and i&#x27;m very happy with it &amp;#34;cause it;s great. now i&#x27;m complete. i recommend this.</li>
    <li> The clips are kind of hard to clip on yourself, but you aren&#x27;t really meant to do that. Other than that, does its job perfectly and manages to fit my rather large build.</li>
    <li> Nice cape with solid construction. It’s slippery enough that hair should slide off, but not so slippery that it’s impossible to wear. You have to really press on the snaps to get them to close, but they open with a pretty firm tug. There’s enough snaps going down the pack to accommodate both the thinnest as well as beefiest necks you’d happen to encounter. The black color is neutral enough to fit in pretty much anywhere. I would expect it to be a good fit for all sizes of people, with ample material to cover someone to at least the mid-thigh (would probably be longer for most). Pretty basic!</li>
    <li> Rated this cape very high since it came with snaps and not velcro on the neck line, so it was easily adjustable and make of light weight nylon.  The size was also a plus since not everyone is the same size and the black makes it unisexual.  Using this cape while cutting and styling hair will also keep it fresh and clean appearing, since once again there is no velcro on the neckline to trap hair, string, or lint material from towels. Due to the snaps, it will also maintain the integrity of the neckline and last longer.  The lightweight nylon was comfortable even when used while under a hair dryer.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I like the light, breezy feel, so it is perfect to sit under for 30 minutes while I get my hair cut.  When it comes to coloring, however, I would not trust it to protect my clothing, because it is not waterproof.  This is not an issue for me because I don’t color every time I get my hair cut, so I don’t mind using a different cape for that.  This is a well made product, with the snaps firmly attached, and it is machine washable.  I would recommend this Professional Black Nylon Hair Styling Salon Cape with Snaps for professional and non-professional barbers and stylists.</li>
    <li> This styling cape is a very quality product for the price.  It is shiny and nice to the touch, but doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap even though it is nylon, which is sometimes hit or miss.  A lot of the reviews seem to focus on the fact that it isn&#x27;t waterproof, which is true in the strict sense.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t work to wash hair with, that is true.  However, it is water resistant, and if I run it under the sink, water does largely bead off and not soak in.  In that way, I wouldn&#x27;t be worried about cutting damp hair, and it might be ok for coloring purposes.  Overall, the product is well constructed.  There is no fraying along the edges, and it appears to be of fairly high quality.  The snaps work well and there are enough settings that it should fit a wide variety of neck sizes, children to adult.  The cape is very light weight, which is nice, especially if a person gets easily overheated.  Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> SalonGuys sent me an assorted pack of sample items to review that included this Black Styling Cape. I was pleasantly surprised at how lightweight cool and comfortable it is to wear. Hair slides right off to the floor, though I&#x27;m primarily using it at my makeup chair to protect clothing from airbrush makeup overspray. I liked that it is large, yet remains so lightweight it doesn&#x27;t get us hot and sweaty. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet, and sure hope it holds up, because I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This cape is ideal if your only use for it is cutting hair.  It covers a large area and will keep your clothes free of the cut hair and it snaps well around the neck.  I used it while getting my hair styled. My hair had to be wet so we had to use a spray bottle of water to mist it and a lot of the water soaked through to my clothes.  The material is thin and is not water repellent, You can very easily make out images if you hold it up to look through it. It didn&#x27;t serve too well for my purpose, but for cutting hair, or doing anything that doesn&#x27;t involve liquid, I say you can&#x27;t go wrong. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality cape that is reasonably priced.  I&#x27;m sure it will hold up to a lot of use!  Snaps appear to be high quality too!</li>
    <li> There doesn’t seem to be much point in dragging little boys to a hair salon, it’s traumatic for all involved. If you’re a home hair “stylist” by necessity, like me, you’ll love this cape. Besides protecting clothing and necks from falling itchy hair, I’ve found this cape has a good drape (important because we sometimes have to resort to a number of different stacking seating options to get our shortest and squirmiest at a level poised to maximize a successful result, and the cape still keeps things covered). There are enough snaps strategically situated along the neckline to fit the whole family.  If it could magically make our 3 year old WANT to get his hair cut I’d give it 6 stars.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a longer cape which is nice however only in the front. It is a lot shorter in the back which may cause a problem with longer hair like mine, It does have adjustable plastic snaps. I am not a stylist I will say this, but I have given this to my sister who use to be.  She usually cuts my hair as well as his her daughters hair. Since she does have a wide variety of whom she cuts its nice that she can adjust it. It&#x27;s nylon so the hair will roll right off rather than sticking to the cape. I don&#x27;t think the price is bad but I am also not a hair stylist so I am not sure how the pricing runs for capes. Seems like it would be easy to wash as well.</li>
    <li> Good for necks from 11&amp;#34; up to 21&amp;#34;. Snaps together with plastic snaps. The fabric is thin, so much so you can see through it but its still tightly woven. Plenty long enough for adults but perfect to cover a child&#x27;s entire body. A can&#x27;t recommend it for professional use but for home it works very well.</li>
    <li> I like how this cape can be worn in several ways. Traditional, kimono style. It&#x27;s very versatile in order to fit different body types.</li>
    <li> I recently received this salon cape in the mail and so far so good.  The material isn’t thick so it is very lightweight and will be nice and cool to use during the hotter months, or really just in general as it can get a little warm while under a hair dryer.  The snap closure is easy to use and doesn’t get caught up in hair.  There are a lot of snaps in the back so the sizing can be adjustable to fit both men and women.  Material looks great for easy cleanup and the description says it is machine washable so that will be nice.  Love the addition of a hook on this cape so that it can be hung up.</li>
    <li> I know capes are not very exciting to talk about, so I will try to make this interesting! First of all, I love the shape of the cape, and the length. It is shaped very well to cover all of the body when using it and is long enough to cover the body as well. Its not too thick either, so wearing it did not make me too hot. I used it just for doing my hair and makeup and it worked well for that. I used it when doing those things because I was already dressed and didn&#x27;t want to risk spilling makeup on my clothes, or getting hairspray on myself and getting all sticky. I would never have thought to use the cape for that but I was sent this item to try for free and I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to try it because it worked just for what I wanted it for, and i would definitely use it again! I had makeup all over the cape and it was all sticky from the hairspray so I&#x27;m definitely glad I decided to use it and will use it every time I&#x27;m getting ready now! I am due to get my hair done so I will use it for that as well, since I know it works so well to cover everything up :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a salon cape for under $10. It&#x27;s easy to use and does what it was meant to do.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, fits small to xlarge neck sizes, the back could&#x27;ve been a little longer but otherwise as expected. I would recommend this cape</li>
    <li> My sister colors her hair regularly and she always makes a mess, so this product was a good one to try. The adjustable snap closures on the cape were useful in getting the right fit that was not too loose or too tight. There is nothing else to say other than that the salon cape did what it was supposed to and the process of my sister coloring her hair is less messy than it used to be. The salon cape has only been used once, so I cannot say anything yet about its longevity but I think that it will last for a long time because the material of the cape feels like it is made of good quality nylon.</li>
    <li> I really like the look and feel of the cutting cape. Its lightweight and breathable for those clients that tend to get hot. I love how the hair dose not stick. I don&#x27;t really like the snaps on the cape they don&#x27;t adjust well for bigger clients. Although its small enough for children to wear but dose not fit some men who are more meaty.</li>
    <li> Great, except the neck is to small.  There should be a bigger opening than it has.  I am a guy with a 19 inch neck and velcrow would be  easy and cheap. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I purchased five.  I Will be purchasing again! Love that they don&#x27;t have Velcro!</li>
    <li> So glad to have this cape.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I needed...prompt service...Thank You</li>
    <li> Perfect.. just what I was looking for !!!</li>
    <li> the snaps are a bit difficult to click but the cape works well and its better than having hair all over you</li>
    <li> A must have for professional and or home use! Was always having to was kids clothes also after every hair cut. This buy saves us time, money, soap, &amp; water.</li>
    <li> Great product! Its not too heavy so my clients stay nice and cool.</li>
    <li> Very light. Easy to store it.</li>
    <li> I needed a salon cape for home cuts.  I use it for my children and myself.  It cover wells and is the nylon seems to be of good quality.  But, I wish that it was a little heavier.</li>
    <li> This is a must-have for those quick trims between seeing your stylist. It works way better than a towel, and you can stuff it away when you are done..</li>
    <li> No complaints. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  It&#x27;s a nice, long cape and the fabric is just slick enough that the cut hair congregates together to make an easier dumping action.  Would recommend it to anyone who cuts hair at home!</li>
