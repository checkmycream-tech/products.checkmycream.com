<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells absolutely delicious and I saw more of an affect on my personality than on men</li>
    <li> I bought this, not actually thinking it&#x27;d work, used it once, and didn&#x27;t touch it for a month. Recently, on a school trip I used it again, and realized that in close quarters it is powerful for about two hours after application. I had a test group and it turned on the guys for sure, and suprisingly, one of my liesbian friends who I&#x27;ve known for two years. My only complaint is that it wears off quickly. Also note, it appears that the warmer you are the better it works.</li>
    <li> Smells okay, but this is no &amp;#34;lady slayer&amp;#34;  Smell wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> Have had this product before like the way it smells</li>
    <li> I love how it changes scents.  I can&#x27;t say that men are crawling all over me. lol. But I have received compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. Not much is needed at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate the product but I&#x27;m not in love with it either... I&#x27;m not sure where the pheromones come from in this product ... It smells really good for the first half second but there is something in it that has a strong after smell that is not very appealing . Bc I can&#x27;t stand that after smell I dab a drop of my pumpkin patch essential oils on top of it and together it makes a nice light sweet yummy smell .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as effectiveness goes... I can&#x27;t really say ... I don&#x27;t have a plethora of men coming at me but I haven&#x27;t had a single bad day since I started wearing it . Considering I work in a retail pharmacy I&#x27;m use to dealing with the public and sick people which can get tricky and people can be grumpy ... So whether or not it is coincidence I can&#x27;t really say but it will update this later on the longer I wear it.</li>
    <li> This snake oil should be called Pure Placebo for Men (Guaranteed NOT to attract women, only your hard-earned cash). If you use this stuff and think it works, you&#x27;re being fooled by placebo effect, which means your feeling that the product works is imaginary, not due to the product actually being effective. This is the well-documented &amp;#34;sugar pill&amp;#34; effect, that has to be controlled for when testing the effectiveness of any drug, supplement, or procedure if you want to know if the thing actually works.</li>
    <li> Well i dont see any result or difference at all, except for mosquitoes they dont stop buggin me. Oh and a friend told me &amp;#34;hey you stink like you just had sex&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Have not had to use yet but smells like the right stuff!</li>
    <li> Love the smell , it really drives men crazy :) I recommend it !!!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Ships very promptly.</li>
    <li> I have always loved his stuff, I have to get more soon ;)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference but I like the smell</li>
    <li> You will love it for sure</li>
    <li> Not useful at all and doesn&#x27;t have any effect..</li>
    <li> Love love love how this smells! I describe it as liquid skittles...I love it when he wears this stuff 😻</li>
    <li> Was at a toy party at a friends house. The host introduced this product and passed it around. I took a small amount and rubbed it on my neck, chest, and arms and almost immediately, the family&#x27;s dog ran out of nowhere and jumped on my lap. He bypassed several other ladies sitting around and jumped directly on me. Needless to say. I got myself two bottles. 😃. My hubby is already very attracted to me so I can&#x27;t say things have gotten better in this department. Things are great like they&#x27;ve always been.</li>
    <li> My most favorite perfume, never overpowering no matter how much you use.</li>
    <li> I used this about five years ago and Loved it. I was so glad to find it again! And I still LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;From my earlier usage, I found that it smelled very good on the majority of my friends, so your odds are pretty good! I put it on my wrists (without rubbing it in) and throughout the day I take a deep smell.</li>
    <li> Does it smell nice? Yes.  Will it do anything that proper grooming won&#x27;t? So far, I would say no.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and it truly does work, all eyes will be on you all day. I had bought the same thing at Athena&#x27;s home novelties and the price was like $25 for one bottle! stock up or give this as gifts. It is amazing, ships fast, and smells different one everyone! The only thing is don&#x27;t keep it near a window or in your car, having it sit in the sun or get too cold makes it go funny; not bad just turns it into a different consistency</li>
    <li> After I put this on my neck and chest, my husband wasn&#x27;t able to keep his hands off me. Right away he commented on how lovely I smelled. He didn&#x27;t even know I bought this, so personally I think it works great. And the scent is a wonderful fruity smell, not overwhelming! (:</li>
    <li> This was crap. Who the hell is doing the reviews on here</li>
    <li> So happy to find this in a 3 pack. It was the same price I paid for just one bottle half the size.</li>
    <li> I use this one almost daily.  Just small amount on my body it last all day.  I love the light scent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It ups my sales every time I wear it.  My hubby also goes nuts for it too.</li>
    <li> https://mrsblondysexytoyconsultant.yourpassionconsultant.com/ good stuff but could be old since not sold for our site so go check it out on my page</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this perfume. It&#x27;s not overbearing or too strong. It doesn&#x27;t last very long but when I applied my usual fragrance over this it really brought that smell out. As far a attractant? The only person I could test it out on is my husband and yes, he was all over me. But, he is always all over me so that doesn&#x27;t help at all... He is very picky about the perfumes I wear and very vocal if he doesn&#x27;t like one but did say I smelled good. I did venture out somewhat reluctantly to the grocery store. I was very cautious as I wandered the isles due to what I read on the reviews I feared every man that walked past me was going to attack me because I was wearing this perfume. One man did ask me where the baked beans were if that counts. Did I see a glimmer of desire in his eyes? Was it me or the possibility of having baked beans for dinner? Who knows. But if your looking for a nice clean, subtle fragrance this is as good as the next.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and how it is personalized to your own body chemistry. This is a great product &amp; value.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what you may think. Smells good. Last a pretty good length of time. Does not drive anyone wild, but it does seem to get peoples attention and put them at ease which is pretty amazing in itself. I mix with body oil which makes it go a long way. I do get compliments on my &amp;#34;unique scent&amp;#34; because it does seem to boost your own natural scent.</li>
    <li> It has a very clean, smooth smell. Ladies love it! Confidence is definitely boosted, and when that happens, everyone is attracted :)</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Combined with other scents, it&#x27;s long lasting.  It also does well by itself.</li>
    <li> smelled like sweat waste of money</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this perfume.  It actually goes from a light fruity scent to a little bit of a soft musk later in the day.  It is wonderful for boosting your spirits and attitude.  My Husband loves the scent and I have noticed a change in how he responds to me! Will definitely be purchasing more in the future!</li>
    <li> Got this fer a family member who said it really drives the opp sex wild. So I said it&#x27;s the season to be jolly why not get it on &amp; be jolly. Haven&#x27;t heard negative feedback about it so my guess is it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> The product was packed perfectly, arrived in the time limit and as always smells amazing! I really only wear oils and this mixes with your own smell to make a perfume unlike anyone elses. Hands down my favorite and I will always reorder :)</li>
    <li> Love the scent, my man says it smells pretty however it hasnt made him behave any differently than normal. Also the frangrance only last a few hours.</li>
    <li> Used it for almost 2/weeks and did not observe any difference .</li>
    <li> Nice smell but very lightly scented mixes great with my body spray but this is merely a novelty item and does not work</li>
    <li> This did not work for me.  I did read the reviews and thought it would work but i could not tell the difference nor could anybody else.&lt;br /&gt;I do use another type of product that is an oli and when I wear it, I get all kinds of compliments.</li>
    <li> Does not smell as strong as the product I&#x27;ve bought in stores. Slightly disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using pheromones since her early twenties (she is now approaching 40) and she always used to buy her &#x27;&#x27;special vial&#x27;&#x27; of premium pheromones she spent over 100.00 per bottle with shipping on the famous Dr. Cutler&#x27;s Athena Pheromones.  She initially saw the news program that showcased Cutler&#x27;s pheromones and the reactions people gave one another with pheromones and without pheromones (even a set of twins) and she became a believer after she read more on the subject and tried it for herself.  She has always relied on the pheromones as the most important cosmetic she could wear since then because we both have noticed a dramatic difference in the way both women and men reacted to her when she used it faithfully and as Cutler outlined in her directions.  She was treated with more kindness, more respect, people warmed to her more easily, and she was clearly more desirable to men ( my wife is a stunning woman with some small time modeling jobs such as in the hair industry, but there is no denying that she definitely drew more attention with pheromones or we wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on her &#x27;must have&#x27; cosmetic).  The only problem with Cutler&#x27;s product versus this one is the price, sadly.  My wife had convinced me pheromones worked, and I too, wanted an advantage with the way people reacted with me so I also had briefly used Cutler&#x27;s product and with great results such as friendliness from both sexes, business meetings seemingly going much more personal and with warmth and reception to ideas, and yes, more female attention (for me, this was just a bonus to my ego, I love my wife and she me as we have six children together, so we obviously find each other very attractive).  Luckily, I have no need for a large ego but I missed having the pheromones for work!  There was a SIGNIFICANT difference in the way people interacted with me, or so it seems.  My wife actually first found Pure Instinct through Tasteful Treasures, a novelty company that is an MLM, and her friend was a distributor for them.  Her friend had a sale page on FaceBook and my wife saw the photograph of the pheromones and immediately she wanted to try them because her friend was willing to barter the pheromones at 79.00 per bottle for beauty items my wife deals in.  That&#x27;s right, this same product, with the same exact name, distributed by Tasteful Treasures, is 79.00 or thereabouts.  This product, although with almost the same exact look on the front, is not affiliated with them in any way it seems, but for some reason, is in the exact same blue bottle, with the exact same black cap, and the font of the print exactly the same, not to mention:  the product was EXACTLY the same!  My wife opened her Tasteful Treasures bottle and compared it to this one and it was exactly the same scent, the same quality, and we are sure it is the same product at a delicious price!  What a delight!  Now, we both use THIS product together and with daily use, our intimate life has become much more noticeable closer, we are holding hands more, we are wanting to be closer physically. The way we communicate even seems improved.  If this is a placebo, then it&#x27;s money well spent for it for that effect.  The way we both use the product is the same:  use the wand in the bottle with NO lotions or creams on the areas you want to use it on (we use it on our hair, behind our ears, underneath our nostrils a dab, wrists, underarms, neck, etc.).  It is a pleasant, unisex, sexy scent for both sexes, which was a concern of ours initially.  We use our regular scents in conjunction with the pheromones, just a small amount of both will last all working day, however, a touch up bottle is in my wife&#x27;s purse at all times because it is quite humid in Florida this time of year and humidity can dampen the effects with even a mild sweat and also because with this product neither of us have the need for deodorants anymore!  We smell heavenly, the two of us, using just pheromones and a spritz of Creed Imperial for me and Chanel Coco for her in the place of deodorants.  For best results, use daily.  It is not recommended by Cutler to spray pheromones according to her research.  This blue bottle is also acceptable and you can add the product directly into your cologne if you want, but we do not use spray bottles.  We love this product because of the wand which controls how much to use, the cost, the unisex appeal, the obvious results from using it, and it also stands alone as a very light and very sexy scent all alone if looking for simplicity.  We also use it alone especially on weekends to spare costs of our expensive colognes and to the beach, grocery, wherever, whenever.  We both highly recommend this product.  My wife is a woman of habit and was very insecure at first on trying something new, but with the initial barter deal she had with her friend, and to try it that way, she is now hooked.  I am back to using pheromones by Pure Instinct because for under 30.00, it is well worth the enhanced physical intimacy my wife and I both lovingly share.  Pheromones naturally decline with age, so we see this also as an anti-aging cosmetic. We will both reorder this product as long as the prices stay so reasonable and the formula does not change.</li>
    <li> Pure Instinct smells delicious. And I like the blue little bottle. When ever I were it I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite pheromone perfume. It can smell one of three ways, fruity, musky, or flowery. For me it smells kind of fruity with a hint of musk. The seller was great. They ship fast and package it well.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! The nice thing it works with men and women. So, when out and about meeting new people - all are attracted to you.</li>
    <li> Buy this expecting video head cleaner, and you will be disappointed completely.  I know, I bought it.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this expecting video head cleaner, and you will be disappointed completely.  I know, I bought it.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this expecting video head cleaner, and you will be disappointed completely.  I know, I bought it.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Well I been trying pure instinct and I really think its work.  I like it alot. .</li>
    <li> surprisingly amazing product!  it works very good attracting people, suddenly  i  became the  most friendly guy..i also got more comments like &amp;#34;you are so nice&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;you are very funny&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;you are cute&amp;#34;  i am really  happy.  it  works also at the  gym when i am sweating lol  ...its  kinda  crazy because i was  very shy about talking to people before  taking a shower... it  seems  that  they like the nasty smelling, though  hahahaha.</li>
    <li> Favorite! Great scent, so clean. Will definitely reorder. Shipping was ahead of estimated arrival date. All positive.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works with my cologne of choice.  I get a few compliments wearing this now and again.  Women won&#x27;t be throwing themselves at you; so don&#x27;t buy it for that reason.  Get it for the very reasonable price and confidence boosting smell.  Hot and humid days do increase the radius of diffusion for both this and my regular cologne.  Bonus!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve user other pheromone colognes before and always found the smell pleasant or non-nondescript.  This stuff has a heavy floral scent with a faint but noticeable cat-piss underlying odor.  I hate throwing anything away, but I really do not like this stuff.  I definitely believe in pheromones and the ones in this perfume might work as intended, but the smell of cat urine is an obvious deal-breaker...</li>
    <li> I have tried this product and no affect at all I was very disappointed. I was hoping for something  to happen but nothing I tried for Three days and not a thing. MY man was no different. I&#x27;m a good looking woman I&#x27;ve been told and keep in shape. My advice don&#x27;t buy if there is not a money back I now have Three bottles of something that doesn&#x27;t work:(</li>
    <li> Smell must be dependent upon wearer. Smells fine on me. Will say that I&#x27;ve found it to be appealing to both genders, noticably in fact. Warmer days enhance smell. Was running a few errands on a warm day and found myself getting flirted with. Psychosomatic? Confidence booster? Snake oil? Who knows, definitely dont mind the results.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll if could my money back I&#x27;d take, nothing special,  I been trying another&#x27;s and working better</li>
    <li> This oil smells wonderful and you only need to use a few drops to smell it all day long. Not overpowering at all just a nice light scent. I do notice when I wear it I seem to make more tips than the days I wear my regular perfume. Coincidence? Perhaps, but its worth the few drops just in case. ;)</li>
    <li> It smells really nice, and applies easily. I dont have any skin reactions to it which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as far as how well it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;, Hmm... I have been pretty lucky with it on, but also the same with it off, so I cant realyl say i have any proof that it does much other than smell nice. I do still wear it on a date or anything though, at least alongside a few other scents to make me smell pretty.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for this three pack! Just one at the local shop goes for $20.  Typically, with run of the mill spray perfume the scent is overbearingly strong at first, then dissipates to nothing within an hour or so.  However, these scented oils are my favorite perfume in part because it lasts all day, with just the perfect hint of scent left on you- not too strong and not too weak. That&#x27;s not even the best part though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHEROMONES! Every person that puts this on will have a different scent.  Mine is sweet, my husband smells like oranges- that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s interacting with your natural body chemistry.  I have noticed that people seem to notice me more when I have this on, and if I go out I typically get more drinks bought for me. Do I tell them it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re sniffing my pheromones and are attracted to my body chemistry? No.  But we know.  We know.  Because of that, I generally feel more confident when I have this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: My husband maintains that the smell of this is &amp;#34;to dainty&amp;#34; to be considered a cologne, but loves it on me.</li>
    <li> So, I have been using this for about 2-3 weeks straight now. I can definitely attest to this being a mood enhancing formula. It makes me feel more....ME... do men fall at my feet? No. But, some of the ones that interact are a bit nicer. They hover a bit more, but it doesn&#x27;t bring them from across the room, I think they have to get a good whiff, and it needs time to register. At work, I get more smiles, more greetings, a bit more attention, but only after I&#x27;ve been there for a while. The scent is quite pleasant on it&#x27;s own, and when worn alone, doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours,  but I spray a little vanilla scented bodyspray and I can squeeze a few more hours out of it. I apply to my scalp, since I work in a place where I can work up a sweat, pulse points, and a little in the cleavage. I am relaxed, calm, confident, I find myself acting on impulse a bit more and generally having it work out for me. So five stars, but more for the way it makes me feel as opposed to drawing guys to me.</li>
    <li> I purchased it before and it keeps me in a good mood.  I don&#x27;t think it affects anyone else, but I think it smells great and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great!</li>
    <li> Love them, arrived super fast in a well packed box. The scent is soft and slightly sweet does not overpower my perfume.</li>
    <li> Works really well on my hubby and noticed other men approach me more often than normal.  Smells like gummy bears and not too strong, don&#x27;t need to put a lot on just few drops behind the ears and wrists.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product, will order again.</li>
    <li> I like this perfume it&#x27;s awesome especially for the ladies it really works guys they will notice your pheromones find you naturally I love it</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this, and wonders what the hell I have on (;</li>
    <li> I has a very nice sent.</li>
    <li> I thought I loved this scent.  I remember loving this scent.  I love the roll-on version of this scent that I bought a few months ago from a &#x27;Passion Parties&#x27; consultant.  But this.. is different.  It&#x27;s not as strong, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to be as nice as the roll on or the product I had purchased years ago.  It&#x27;s not terrible.. it&#x27;s just not what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> A bit too fruity for me. Not crazy about it. Three bottle set is too much. One would have been enough. Gave one to a friend. Will use but won&#x27;t buy a&lt;br /&gt;Gain.</li>
    <li> Absolutely does not work and it&#x27;s fragrance leaves something to be desired. It&#x27;s basically snake oil. (Look up this it up if you don&#x27;t understand what snake oil is.) An absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> It was everything expected at half the cost!</li>
    <li> Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time or money. The product does not work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and order regularly. It has a appealing scent, that can be worn by men and women.</li>
    <li> This....does not smell good....at all. I was excited to try it and should have just bought one instead of the three pack. After spending hours of reading through the reviews I thought, &amp;#34;Okay I&#x27;ll give this a shot&amp;#34;. There is an underlying &amp;#34;cat piss&amp;#34; smell (which I did read from a few other reviews but what are the chances a couple reviews versus hundreds are true?). In this case, I should have passed on the product. This is not saying anything bad about the seller. The product came in time and was well packaged. The makers of the scent should have done better though. Thank you for a good purchasing experience. I wish I could say something better about the product itself.</li>
    <li> Acts as a repellent instead :( does opposite work , i wish there was negative one star possible. I was stupid to buy a pack on 3 . The oil smell is ok tolerable. But works even as perfume or as intended to attract some one no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using for a bit, if anything changes which i doubt i will update by review. For now negative 5 :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great stuff ladies, do yourself a favor and get a bottle!</li>
    <li> Smell it great but I haven&#x27;t try to see if it worked.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells great and boosts confidence and been using this for years. It don&#x27;t last long but you can apply it all day for being a small bottle it lasts for ever</li>
    <li> What I love about this product is it is a neutral scent.  I am a professional and wearing strong perfumes/colongnes is not good while I meet with so many individuals.  This allows for a natural, neutral scent.</li>
    <li> Since wearing this my tips as a hairdresser/ makeup artist have increased. I also seem to get a lot more attention when I go anywhere with this stuff on. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product really works!  Great seller!</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing. My boyfriend can&#x27;t keep his hands off of me when I wear it. There is a downside though. The smell wears off after about thirty minutes of wearing it. But other than that it is excellent. This can be worn as an everyday perfume as well. I would and have recommended this to many people</li>
    <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> The only reason this doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is because smell just doesn&#x27;t last long at all. At max about an hour. Otherwise I really didn&#x27;t notice any effects around other people. Women or men. I&#x27;ve only managed to wear it three times so far. Now....why I gave it four. I was skeptical this would work on my husband. I had worn it a couple times and he had yet to smell me with it on. I almost got busted when he asked why my neck was glistening (dropped too much and I was shining!) So I had it on and at first nothing. Then about an hour later he kept insisting on holding me. After we had dinner he wanted me to sit on his lap and he kept calling me beautiful. At some point after drinking some wine he looked at me and said &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with me&amp;#34; with concerned eyes. I almost felt bad but then remembered how after 10 years of marriage that our lust is lacking. Will keep putting it on and see how he responds. He&#x27;s currently out of town.</li>
    <li> They came on time and they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Turned Me Into a Machine! I Have Never Been More Popular...</li>
    <li> Bought this for a girl, and tried it myself....great smell, get compliments from the women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely unisex, doesnt last long, but worth it</li>
    <li> Like others had stated, the fragrance does not last longer than 30 minutes. But decided to see for myself. It has somewhat of a weird &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; scent.  Would not order again.</li>
    <li> This smells different on everyone. On me, it has a weird floral and musky scent that guys seem to go insane for. On my friend, it has a more acidic and earthy blend. I absolutely love this stuff and recommend it to anyone trying to complement their body&#x27;s natural chemistry. It also blends well with just about every perfume on the market. Whether or not it will help you attract a mate is another question, but any good smell will make anyone naturally more appealing.</li>
    <li> This has a citrus scent but its not too feminine or masculine just neutral. Works as well as any other pheromone product. For business and pleasure.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Ive been getting Pure Instinct for years and it works. Plus smells wonderful. Delivered fast and in good condition.</li>
    <li> There are sometimes when I like to just put this on because it smells so good. My husband goes crazy when I wear it and can&#x27;t keep his hands off me. I wore this at the club before and got hit on a lot. My husband wore it one time and I had no clue and of course I was so drawn to him. It definitely works for both men and women.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, arrived quick.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes! I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for about two years now, and I believe the science behind this does work. It does smell very sweet and fruity at first, but the smell adapts to your own. I&#x27;m not sure if it leads to someone becoming more sexually attractive (I get asked out a lot, with or without), but I definitely noticed the scent helps me and others become more relaxed...which does in turn lead to more flirtation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m happy to find this on here, because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper here than at most lingerie stores.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic! Smells great and can be mixed with any perfume!</li>
    <li> I really like the scent and so does my male cat and human males seem to like it so i ordered more but mostly for the scent and the feel of my skin after soaking in a hot bath</li>
    <li> This stuff works. This gets all the gears moving and those affected are not really even sure why. It smells fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> Didnt see any results</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soft and sexy fragrance.  I always get compliments when I wear it and it is soft to rub on your hands.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for years.  It really enhances the attitude of everyone around you, and my boyfriend thinks it smells great! And he can never keep his hands off of me when i wear this!! A+++++ Can&#x27;t beat the price either! Thanks! Will shop again!</li>
    <li> Prompt deliver, fruity to a light musk. I would suggest addind a bit to your clothes to last longer and enjoy the reactions, although not much it still kind  of interesting!</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommend. I use this for dates, business meetings, and sales negotiations. Whenever I want others to like me in a short period of time this product pulls through.</li>
    <li> I love these! They smell so good. I have ordered pure instinct from many companies in the past. My first time smelling them was at an adult party for women. Every since then I was on a mission to find them online at a more reasonable price. Hands down this is the best company to order from and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCE ITS WORKS.. FIRST I DOUBT ABOUT THIS KIND OF PRODUCE TO BUY..AFTER A WEEK I HAD MORE MALES INTERESTING IN ME..THEY JUST SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ME.. I ASK WHAT IS IT..  THEY SAY I DON&#x27;T KNOW BUT I LIKE YOU...I JUST SMILE ABOUT IT...I WOULD RECOMMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO MY FRIENDS.......THANK YOU !!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this product. I wore it to a local establishment &amp; sat down &amp; didn&#x27;t have to buy a drink all night...not used to paying for my own drinks..so something worked :)</li>
    <li> Smells great. My husband loves when I wear this.</li>
    <li> Like mangos and cat um smell? Apparently that is what you will get when buying this item. It is a roll-on that should not be worn with other perfumes if you want it to work best. Charisma is boosted substantially with both sexes? Curious.  Anyhow I have been wearing it 3 days and I have people actually aggravated they cannot spend more time with me out of the blue? I could not make this up. I cannot say this is a miracle product by any means but what on earth?</li>
    <li> Is very good product for mutual attraction the oil is real price good  I used to mix with my cream perfume and give at a gift to my family in friends</li>
    <li> This is not what I had hoped for. Very disappointed. This is not an appealing fragrance. It is extremely sweet smelling.</li>
    <li> love this perfume!  i&#x27;m a repeat customer and always get my order with in 3 or 4 days of ordering!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! I can&#x27;t describe it but it&#x27;s sweet and subtle. I&#x27;m not sure if it really works and that&#x27;s fine I&#x27;d rather Just wear it for the smell. But one bummer is that it really doesn&#x27;t last long. I also like the bottle so that was fun</li>
    <li> I started using pheromones about 7 yrs ago. I wasnt sure of this product because its a different brand. When i got it and opened it up it has the same smell and when put on my skin it produces the beautiful smell with my skin. You gain more confidence and men are attracted more!!!! I plan on buying the 3 pack again. You can never have too much!!!!! The product came fast! Before it was set to deliver.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and love it, I use it with my perfume and it smells diffrent on everyone...</li>
    <li> Im OBSESSED with these pheromones and have been wearing them for literally years. Everyone compliments me when I wear them and many of my friends have started wearing them, too. Other places sell them for $20/bottle - cant beat this price!</li>
    <li> I have to be honest. After reading all the positive reviews I desided to give this product a try. Well I haven&#x27;t had anything positive to say about this product it wasn&#x27;t what I expected! I am indeed very disappointed with it. I don&#x27;t understand how people can say things that aren&#x27;t true just to promote a product.</li>
    <li> I feel happy and confident when I weAr pure instinct.</li>
    <li> I love this product. In the store they sell for $17 each.. This sent adapts to your natural sent; enhancing it just a tad...  GUYS love it.. I was introduced to this when i use to bar tend. It&#x27;s a tip magnate. Will order again when BEFORE i run out.</li>
    <li> I like everyday people come to talk to me  love it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really work, I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! But each person is different. I would try a single bottle before stocking up because pheromones tend to smell different on everybody depending on their body chemistry.</li>
    <li> It works!!!  Even the chick at work who hates me, is nice to me on the days I wear it. It has been tested, and It has been proven to me. I first got this stuff at a passion party 7 years ago, still smells the same but its not nearly as expensive. I dont know what I will do if they stop making this stuff. It is truely an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone always asks me what Im wearing, I still haven&#x27;t told them. Lol Wear it to a club, work, school, and pay attention to how differently people treat you. Put it on your wrists, neck, and the middle of your arm where your arm bends, thats a major point your veins and artery runs, it will give off that scent more so than just your wrist.  If you are in the intimate setting, rub it on your inner thighs and watch your significant other go crazy.</li>
    <li> personally I don&#x27;t like the way it smells but my dog humped my leg 3 times last night and it was just after I used this the first time. He has never done that in 4 years so I guess it works on some level.....LOL</li>
    <li> I love the way these smell on me. It&#x27;s different for everyone, but my smell is &amp;#34;gummy bears!&amp;#34; ALSO, having this helped me know I was pregnant! I put it on one day and instead of candy, I smelled like ammonia! So I took a preggo test and... yep! Knocked up. :)</li>
