      <li>Living in New York, our hands crack and hurt.  </li>
      <li>These gloves may be large, but they are certainly not a men&#x27;s large.  </li>
      <li>The one pair of gloves is fine, but not satisfied with result/fulfillment of my order.</li>
      <li>Not very tight around the wrists, but they stay on well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve washed them all now at least four times (delicate cycle, then laid out on a drying rack) and they are still in good shape.</li>

    <li> Exactly what I needed for a great price.  I am a female with puffy hands (ring size US 8.5) and these fit my hands perfectly.</li>
    <li> These gloves are great for dry hands.  I put on some heavy cream and wear them to bed.  I love them.</li>
    <li> good buy, helps to heal my fingers</li>
    <li> All five gloves were included in the packet.  Men&#x27;s large is sill a bit small for 6&#x27;0, 200 lb. man. Extra large would be better, but didn&#x27;t see that option, so I am using them.</li>
    <li> The size seems consistent with regular glove sizes and they work very well when worn over lotioned hands when sleeping.</li>
    <li> They are smaller than printed size on box. These are barely medium &amp; shrink in the wash down to small. They do get the job done for as long as they last.</li>
    <li> I have really dry cracked hands,so I used  these at night with cream the Dr. RX&#x27;d. They are a bit snug and don&#x27;t think you can wash and reuse,  so  I just pitched mine.  hands are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess you could use these for many uses that you didn&#x27;t want  to soil say a rare book with oil from your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;would buy again.</li>
    <li> Work great for keeping moisture on the hands at night.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought these gloves for my teenage son.  He has hand eczema, so he needs to wear a lotion on his hands and keep them covered with gloves when he can.  These work perfectly.  They are easy for him to slip on and off, and easy for me to wash(no special care needed).  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re basic goves.  They&#x27;re good for putting on creams for sleeping.  I have big man hands, and they&#x27;re not strechy.</li>
    <li> Men&#x27;s large is still too small - won&#x27;t stay on my husband&#x27;s hand overnight</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  They stretch so much at the base of the glove, they fall off my hands when I wear them to sleep.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good!  Hold up well even after washing. Not very tight around the wrists, but they stay on well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for cotton gloves to wear over moisturizer to help my dry hands this winter.  The fit was strange, like the thumb was sewn in wrong. But they did stay on my hands.</li>
    <li> The listing said 5 pairs of gloves, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. Each pair was in their own box exactly as shown in the product description and then bundled together. The gloves fit and are of good quality. I don&#x27;t know what more I could ask for.</li>
    <li> As someone that has psoriasis, these gloves are a help when extra moisturizing is required. The delivery to my home was prompt and the gloves were what I expected.</li>
    <li> I received the gloves in great time and got all 5 pairs of gloves.  These gloves may be large, but they are certainly not a men&#x27;s large.  I tend to wear a women&#x27;s medium/large glove and these fit me perfectly (haven&#x27;t washed them yet). They are fabulous to wear overnight to keep lotion on my hands and feel like a decent quality cotton -- no rips in the seams or tears of any sort. Would definitely buy again should I need more!</li>
    <li> They work well when treating dry, cracked fingers.</li>
    <li> Special pack of 5 CARA INC GLOVE CARA COTTON MENS 86 LG for $12.78&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above description and price is what I paid for and expected to receive. Only one pair of gloves came - not 5. When I called Amazon about it, it was not in stock at warehouse so they could only credit me $10.78 and not send other 4 pairs. The reason I ordered 5 pairs and had it combined with another Amazon order was so I could get free shipping. The one pair of gloves is fine, but not satisfied with result/fulfillment of my order.</li>
    <li> My package contained five pairs of sturdy cotton gloves, just the right size for me.&lt;br /&gt;The cuffs are hemmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear them under my gardening gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve washed them all now at least four times (delicate cycle, then laid out on a drying rack) and they are still in good shape.</li>
    <li> These are great for me and my husband.  Living in New York, our hands crack and hurt.  Using O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s hand treatment and then wearing these gloves at night really help.</li>
    <li> Fingers and thumbs of gloves are in proper proportion (unlike others I&#x27;ve tried). I need these for light work and need to have manual dexterity for buttoning buttons and zipping zippers. Can&#x27;t do that when my thumbs aren&#x27;t properly fitted. These will work out very well.</li>
    <li> i bought this because, for the price, it was worth it to get a \\&quot;pack of 5\\&quot; gloves.&lt;br /&gt;but when it arrived i saw it was simply one pair of gloves.&lt;br /&gt;so i returned it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent pair of gloves made of cotton and not a synthetic fiber that&#x27;s good for light work (what I use them for). It&#x27;s not easy to find gloves not made from polyester which is made from petroleum. So if you&#x27;re looking for cotton gloves try these, but they are only for light work/house cleaning or keeping your hands moist when sleeping. Don&#x27;t use them for heavy duty jobs around the garage/house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Made of a natural fiber, cotton.&lt;br /&gt;The cotton gloves were a little on the thin side but seemed to be thick enough to protect my hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a large size and they seemed to fit more like a pair of medium sized gloves. I would purchase a size up since these gloves are one size too small.&lt;br /&gt;One glove had a small hole in it, about 2 cm wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for the glove that had a small hole in it I would have given this product 4 stars.</li>
