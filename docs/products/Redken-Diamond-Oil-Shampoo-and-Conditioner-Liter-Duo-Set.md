      <li>Excellent product, fast shipping</li>
      <li>So far, the best products I have found are: 1) shampoo:</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair feel clean and oil free while taming the fly away hairs and controlling the frizz.</li>
      <li>These are huge bottles and it&#x27;s a pain not to have the pumps!</li>
      <li>It was authentic.</li>
      <li>Great price, and fast delievery.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It has smoothed it out and made it more manageable.  </li>

      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair easier to style,  and I also use the Diamond Oil (gold).</li>
      <li>For me it was just okay.</li>
      <li>but my opinion its better.</li>
      <li>Still a pretty good buy.</li>
      <li>Good price, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>and my hair was always so nice after that first cut.  </li>
      <li>Smells great, lasts a long time and I love the texture that it gives my hair.</li>
      <li>I have somewhat fine hair.</li>
      <li>The product itself is great but the second party provider does not provide what is advertised!!!!</li>
      <li>Wow-it has really done an amazing job to restore the moisture in my hair and make it easier to style.  </li>
      <li>Leave myhair Smooth and shine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Please continue to make this product, available.</li>
      <li>Clean, nourished, and shiny hair -- without all the added gunk.</li>
      <li>Love these products, they make my natural hair so soft and smell amazing!</li>
      <li>This duo set is the right price!  </li>
      <li>Full disclosure: I purchased the Redken Diamond Oil shampoo and conditioner at a salon, not Amazon, and I should have listened to my hair dresser when she said she was &amp;#34;not impressed&amp;#34; with these products before I tried them.</li>
      <li>Item delivered quickly and as promised.</li>
      <li>I always thought it was the cut when you left the salon that made your hair feel amazing</li>
      <li>Tried a sample of this product liked the sample, so ordered the larger bottles.  </li>
      <li>It leaves you hair soft, shiny and frizz free!  </li>
      <li>The conditioner neither smells right nor works right.  </li>
      <li>I also wake up in the morning with it still lying flat and easy to style, not a rats nest!  </li>
      <li>(so it&#x27;s the first thing to get absorbed instead of chlorine water) and I use a special cap that is nearly leak-proof called &amp;#34;My Cap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Diva</li>
      <li>Exactly what it stated online.  </li>
      <li>My stylist uses this on my coarse hair and it is more managable.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s healthy look since starting to use it.</li>
      <li>While the product was what I wanted ,it arrived on time and in good condition- as you can plainly see in the sellers ad - this set</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the extreme anti-snap ones in the blue bottle better.</li>
      <li>:) Another tip that might be helpful: Before I go into chlorine, I coat my dry hair in coconut oil</li>
      <li>Shampoo seemed like you had to use a large amount.</li>
      <li>Really helps my hair stay nicer after it has been colored.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with the shine.</li>
      <li>Nexxus Therape, 2) conditioner: either Redken Butter Silk (which used to be Butter Treat and was better back then but is still okay) or Nexxus Emergencee or Oil Conditioner (the latter can actually get a bit too oily for me), and 3)</li>
      <li>I was using another Redken product that left my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Smells of too much perfume.  </li>
      <li>If you have other kinds of hair or circumstances, maybe it will perform better for you.</li>
      <li>I have very thick, corse hair and this shampoo and conditioner is one of a kind!  </li>
      <li>so it has some breakage and dryness, but this, especially the conditioner, makes my hair very oily and greasy quickly, making me have to wash it every day.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Duo.</li>
      <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars to find a product that will make my hair smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>Shampoo smells right and works like the same Redken I bought at a salon.  </li>
      <li>My hair was super dry and breaking alot.</li>
      <li>It worked the first and second time.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling silky and soft!</li>
      <li>And reading all other reviews, many have had the same experience.  </li>
      <li>The wave is horrid, it has to be flat ironed since it&#x27;s more of a cow lick.  </li>
      <li>Products with mostly natural ingredients do expire at some point.  </li>
      <li>It may just be too old for us.  </li>
      <li>Delivered early.  </li>
      <li>how soft my hair feels.</li>
      <li>love this product, but the seller is SO slow at shipping....</li>
      <li>Actually, there are lots of protein sprays that seem to work fine, such as a brand called &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; and others, as long as your hair gets protein.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is the only one, I have ever tried, that keeps my naturally curly hair straight and no frizz, after flat ironing.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin, fragile hair and am a swimmer, so I need high moisture.</li>
      <li>I first bought it from my hair dresser but its significantly less on Amazon.</li>
      <li>African American with natural hair.  </li>
      <li>I have been able to start washing my hair every other day and using dry shampoo in between when using these products since my hair is not as heavy and greasy with it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried countless products over the past 30 years and am always looking for new products that will infuse moisture in case my current products get discontinued (after so much work finding them).</li>

    <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>

    <li> I love Redken products and Diamond Oil does not disappoint! I love the fragrance and how soft my hair feels. What I was disappointed with was the fact that I did not receive the two pumps that should have been sent along with the shampoo and conditioner. These are huge bottles and it&#x27;s a pain not to have the pumps! That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Loved the shampoo! Leaves hair feeling silky and soft! Great moisturizer for the scalp! Also great price for this product!</li>
    <li> My hair was super dry and breaking alot. I noticed an immediate difference using this product. I always thought it was the cut when you left the salon that made your hair feel amazing but I&#x27;ve discovered it&#x27;s the product. My hair feels that way all the time now. I&#x27;ll definitely spend the money for this quality.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel clean and oil free while taming the fly away hairs and controlling the frizz.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> This company states 2 pumps and does not provide them them when ordered. The product itself is great but the second party provider does not provide what is advertised!!!!</li>
    <li> While the product was what I wanted ,it arrived on time and in good condition- as you can plainly see in the sellers ad - this set was to include 2 pumps.There were no pumps.On the receipt that came with the product,there was a note stating no pumps included.A little after the fact -- once you have purchased the product.The pumps were my deciding factor to purchase from this seller so no I am not happy .I contacted the seller who said she would send pumps but to date she has not.I have her info and will know in the future to not purchase anything else.</li>
    <li> Great product! I was very happy with the seller, shipping and price. Thank you! I will purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I purchased the Redken Diamond Oil shampoo and conditioner at a salon, not Amazon, and I should have listened to my hair dresser when she said she was &amp;#34;not impressed&amp;#34; with these products before I tried them. But they smelled really good and the name of the products sounded moisturizing. I have fine, thin, fragile hair and am a swimmer, so I need high moisture. If you have other kinds of hair or circumstances, maybe it will perform better for you. Unfortunately, the products were damaging and not hydrating/moisturizing for my hair--the shampoo stripped moisture out of my hair and the conditioner had little effect to put it back in. It only took one shampoo to see and feel the effects. I have tried countless products over the past 30 years and am always looking for new products that will infuse moisture in case my current products get discontinued (after so much work finding them). So far, the best products I have found are: 1) shampoo: Nexxus Therape, 2) conditioner: either Redken Butter Silk (which used to be Butter Treat and was better back then but is still okay) or Nexxus Emergencee or Oil Conditioner (the latter can actually get a bit too oily for me), and 3) Redken Anti-Snap protein spray (a leave-in product). Actually, there are lots of protein sprays that seem to work fine, such as a brand called &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; and others, as long as your hair gets protein. It is the shampoo and conditioner that are generally hard to find, especially since companies continually discontinued, rebrand, and reformulate their products, so if you know of additional products that work for these issues, please share. :) Another tip that might be helpful: Before I go into chlorine, I coat my dry hair in coconut oil (so it&#x27;s the first thing to get absorbed instead of chlorine water) and I use a special cap that is nearly leak-proof called &amp;#34;My Cap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Diva Cap&amp;#34; also on Amazon. After the swim, I rinse my hair out with conditioner only (if I don&#x27;t have to go to work) or wash, condition, and protein spray if I do have to go to work. I hope this info is helpful because I had spent years struggling with balding and breaking hair before learning this routine through painful trial and error (as well as lots of lost money on hair care products). I finally have reliable hair growth and shine.  Thank you for sharing any additional info you might have about products and experiences as well. --Julietdon&#x27;t have to go to work) or wash, condition, and protein spray if I do have to go to work.

    <li> Tried a sample of this product liked the sample, so ordered the larger bottles.  Shampoo seemed like you had to use a large amount. For me it was just okay. Probably would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This product should not advertise using the word &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; as it does not come with the pumps. Buyer beware. Consider the extra cost of pumps into this purchase decision.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, corse hair and this shampoo and conditioner is one of a kind!  I have spent hundreds of dollars to find a product that will make my hair smooth and silky.  And I finally found it!  I will never purchase another kind.</li>
    <li> Awesome it really cleans and softens your hair, without stripping your color. Try the diamond oil serum along with these, the results are far from disappointing!</li>
    <li> I love Redken products, but was disappointed with this set of shampoo and conditioner. I have somewhat fine hair. Using the diamond oil line made my hair snarly and greasy. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with the shine.</li>
    <li> This duo set is the right price!  You can pay up to 5X in a salon.  Delivery was quick, packaging great!  If you order this duo because of the &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; mentioned...you will be disappointed.  Although advertised, they did not come with the package.  And reading all other reviews, many have had the same experience.  About the product....if you have dry dull hair, this shampoo/condition duo is just what you need!  It leaves you hair soft, shiny and frizz free!  Use every 3 or 4th wash...not every day.</li>
    <li> My stylist had used the mask on me after a cut. So i of course had to buy it immediately to use at home. When I saw they Redken made this in a shampoo/conditioner this was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Love this product, wish it was less expensive</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It lasts forever and makes your hair feel great. Every time I use it I feel like I just let &#x3D;t the dale but my opinion its better. If your looking for something to nourish your hair back definitely buy this,</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo Ever!!! This shampoo is the only one, I have ever tried, that keeps my naturally curly hair straight and no frizz, after flat ironing. Please continue to make this product, available. I am sold for life, on this product!!! Great price, and fast delievery. Great sellers.</li>
    <li> I had already been using these products, suggested by my hairstylist of 12 years. But, I was paying the same price for smaller quantity.  I love the way it makes my hair easier to style,  and I also use the Diamond Oil (gold). They also smell great.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have very very thick, slightly wavy hair.  The wave is horrid, it has to be flat ironed since it&#x27;s more of a cow lick.  Using these shampoo and conditioners has done wonders for my hair.  It has smoothed it out and made it more manageable.  It has also lightened it so my hair does not feel as heavy.  I have been able to start washing my hair every other day and using dry shampoo in between when using these products since my hair is not as heavy and greasy with it.  I also wake up in the morning with it still lying flat and easy to style, not a rats nest!  Definitely a game changer for my hair! Love it!</li>
    <li> A hairdresser recommended this.  Good thing it wasn&#x27;t mine, or I would have to question what kind of a hairdresser she was! It worked the first and second time.  After that, I had frizzy, dry, very dry hair!</li>
    <li> Delivered early.  Exactly what it stated online.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> love this product, but the seller is SO slow at shipping.... Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> Really helps my hair stay nicer after it has been colored.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Best ever!!!</li>
    <li> Item delivered quickly and as promised.</li>
    <li> GET  A GREAT STYLIST AND THIS LINE OF PRODUCTS.SHOULD IMPRESS MOST.</li>
    <li> This product must be for people with extremely dry and damaged hair. I highlight my hair with bleach so it has some breakage and dryness, but this, especially the conditioner, makes my hair very oily and greasy quickly, making me have to wash it every day. Don&#x27;t recommend unless you need something as heavy as a conditioner mask every day.</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> Leave myhair Smooth and shine.&lt;br /&gt;Me deja el cabello suave, sedoso y brilloso.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this on my coarse hair and it is more managable.  No frizz or fly aways.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love these products, they make my natural hair so soft and smell amazing!</li>
    <li> Shipped well to avoid leaking. Came with two pumps, as listed. The product has been great for my hair and I Love it!</li>
    <li> The hair salon I go to used this and my hair was always so nice after that first cut.  Decided to buy the Duo on Amazon.  Wow-it has really done an amazing job to restore the moisture in my hair and make it easier to style.  I highly recommend the Duo.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner for my color-treated hair.  Smells great, lasts a long time and I love the texture that it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> African American with natural hair.  Clean, nourished, and shiny hair -- without all the added gunk.</li>
    <li> its not a nice shampoo.. i bought it after reading recommendations online but it doesnt help. whatever it says in description, it doesnt do it. dont buy</li>
    <li> Great product but wasn&#x27;t package how they said. It didn&#x27;t come with pumps.</li>
    <li> Great product and love it on my hair. It was authentic. I first bought it from my hair dresser but its significantly less on Amazon. It&#x27;s one of only two products I use for my hair to protect the color. Good for my hair too, I have had comments about it&#x27;s healthy look since starting to use it.</li>
    <li> This leaves a build up on your hair.  I was using another Redken product that left my hair smooth and shiny.  I thought all the oils in this product would help my hair.  Instead it added tangles and dulled shine.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and great packaging. Awesome product!</li>
