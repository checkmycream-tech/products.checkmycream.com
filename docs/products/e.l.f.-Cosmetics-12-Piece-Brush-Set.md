<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best brushes I have used by far.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with these brushes - e.l.f. makes some great products. The full face and bronzing brushes shed just a little, but to be expected because they&#x27;re very fine brushes. The foundation brush is amazing - best one I&#x27;ve used - and the others work as they should! Very happy with these.</li>
    <li> Brushes worked well when I first got them, after cleaning them a few times they started to shed a LOT.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes because the ones I had before had very hard bristles and would shed a lot, but these one are very soft and don&#x27;t shed, they apply all my makeup flawlessly and the only one I have yet to try it the eyeliner brush, but that is because I have a liquid eyeliner pen so no need for that brush yet. I am very happy I got these and have new brushes to replace the old one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my niece!</li>
    <li> I received these last night and so far I have only use the eye shadow blending brush and the total face brush. Not a big fan of the total face brush. It is too loose in the bristles. But if I only get one that I don&#x27;t like then I will be happy lol</li>
    <li> My gf loved her Xmas gift</li>
    <li> For the price it was not bad, the product was ok in quality . If you dont want to spend the money, then i would recommend this set</li>
    <li> Bought these as birthday gift for daughter&#x27;s friend.  I remembered her saying that they liked E.l.f. products so thought I would order based on brand.  Did have an odor when arrived but I feel this was just the packaging and the brushes were fine.  when they arrived I got them out to show my daughter.  She&#x27;s has champagne taste on my beer budget when it comes to makeup and does a lot of research on makeup products (if only she would put that much effort into school projects).  She loved the brushes and the variety of brushes and asked for a set for herself.  Her friend loved them as well and started using them immediately.</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice for the price that they were.  I do not have to worry that my daughter will mess them up because they were not expensive.</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for about a month now and they are holding up strong. They are soft and work for what I need. Can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
    <li> Great quality and assortment for the cost, love the labeling of which brush does what.  Would definitely order these again!</li>
    <li> Good price for what you get...mostly. The 2 powder brushes are very rough and I don&#x27;t really use them. The also shed a bit...bristles on the face is not a good look. The eye brushes are pretty good though.</li>
    <li> Gave to a friend, she wears more makeup than I ever will...felt she would appreciate it...she likes it very much.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> They looked exactly how they were supposed to! They even have labels on each individual brush! Would and will purchase again when mine wear out! Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> These were individually packaged as if they were meant to be sold separately. Not good for the environment, and not necessary. But they are really nice brushes (once I opened each of them).</li>
    <li> The brushes are great for the price. They work well and are easy to clean. I just wish that they came with a carrying case.</li>
    <li> I just received these items today and I was concerned that they were going to be of a very poor quality based on many of the reviews I have read. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the brushes, although not perfect, are more than adequate for a beginner such as myself. Much like other reviewers before me, I like the look and finish of the brushes and I think they are an enormous bargain for the price. I would strongly recommend this product to other beginners.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer said, these brushes are nice and soft and feel just as good as MAC brushes. I own a few MAC brushes and these feel and apply makeup great!</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes are great but the ones I really was excited to use had hairs coming out within the first use. I would say if you want to get makeup brushes invest in a good set.</li>
    <li> These are very good quality brushes from elf. They are good for only being $1.00. The only think that Bothers me is the big red powder brush. That thing sheds like crazy but the others dont. I love elf!</li>
    <li> smell horrible!!!!!  like chemicals</li>
    <li> It was a good price. That&#x27;s about a dollar per brush. the eye brushes were very soft, but the face brushes besides the foundation one were not soft and kind of scraped my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted new make-up brushes and the E.I.F. brushes are super awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who are getting a basic set for the first time,  I will recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couture</li>
    <li> The brushes all in all are very nice. I have found that the powder brush could be softer but I like the rest. Better than any brushes I have gotten from a big box store!</li>
    <li> Cant wait to try these love my set!!</li>
    <li> Love da brushes, they work really well</li>
    <li> These brushes are really nice.  I don&#x27;t even know how to use them all lol. But these are definitely better than the generic ones I had. The bristles are super soft and feel like silk on your face.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for a coworker, who needed a set of makeup brushes. She was ecstatic that each was labeled for their use. She&#x27;s been having so much fun, no complaints about the brushes yet. However, these were just a starter set.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes are great, while others are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contouring and powder brush (red bristles) are very hard, and kind of hurt to use. I have not picked them up again.&lt;br /&gt;The eyelash comb and the eyebrow comb brush&#x27;s tips came off (although this could be easily fixed with some glue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the eyeshadow brushes, however, were pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve moved onto bigger and better brushes. I bought these brushes a year ago, and sure, as far as I knew about makeup then, these were fine enough for me. But then the bristles started falling out, the barrels detached from the wooden handles, and my makeup was starting to look less and less put together. There is still one of these brushes that I still use, which is the spooley brush, which works wonders on my eyebrows. Otherwise, they are a complete waste, no matter how cheap they are.</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty cheap and affordable but their not good quality and you will hardly use more than half of them. Save your money and purchase whichever ones you need because buying a 12 piece set when half of them are not useful is wasting your time.</li>
    <li> Bought these for someone for Christmas there are a lot of brushes and worth the money</li>
    <li> There are so many brushes and they are so cute, too. Shiny snowy champagne colored, not quite white. I love them a lot, I hope my friend who I bought them for for Christmas will love them too (she def will they are so cute).</li>
    <li> Cheap quality. Feels harsh</li>
    <li> Bought as present, they didn&#x27;t tell me it was shipping from China!!! Plus, China doesn&#x27;t exactly have the best record of safety...who knows what this is made of...???</li>
    <li> I feel like my make up already looks 100 times better using these brushes. And for this price it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> I received this brush set for Christmas and I like it. It’s not the best but it’s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Easy to wash&lt;br /&gt;• Each one comes in an individual clear pouch&lt;br /&gt;• Don’t stain&lt;br /&gt;• Highly functional and do the job well&lt;br /&gt;• Extremely decent price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• The brushes with reddish bristles are fragile and the hairs fall out often&lt;br /&gt;• The earth tools brand eye shadow brushes are better than these for eye shadow&lt;br /&gt;• The bristles/hairs are not very soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I recommend these for beginners or anyone who wants an inexpensive relatively good quality brush set.</li>
    <li> as there were duplicates of brushes, so I actually received 10 distinctive brushes</li>
    <li> I do recommend this had it for a year and they are wonderful&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set a couple of years ago and for the price I will give 5 starts. I really like the eyeliner brush and use it daily to put on my eyebrows and sometimes to line my bottom lids. There eye shadow brush is also very nice and applies a lot of color as for the concealer brush that would be my least favorite of the entire collection.  In the future I will just replace the eyeliner brush and eye shadow brushes there others I can do with out.</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes for someone getting started with brushes, or for backup brushes.  These are a decent quality for the price. I find I go to these brushes for the quick looks during the week, not when I want to blend and take time.  I have not had any problems washing these brushes out and they are not shedding.  Some are better quality that others.  As a set these are a good bargain and give a good basic quality.</li>
    <li> some of the brishles fall out</li>
    <li> If you look at this set as a beginner set it&#x27;s great. The brushes are all labeled and come with a little card that says what each brush does. They are easy to clean and each brush is essentially $1 so what&#x27;s not to love.</li>
    <li> mine started to fall apart</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth buying this set for base makeup on the face.The eyeshadow/blender brush is good, the angled eyeliner brush is too, but the powder brush is super coarse and the liquid foundation brush just came apart after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bronzer brush is also coarse but not as much as the powder brush.</li>
    <li> The package arrived before the EDD. The price is the best!!! &amp; the quality of the brushes are great so they do their job &amp; last for years!!! I would love for them to come with a carrying case.</li>
    <li> Great for the price but the Foundation brush broke within two weeks maybe a month. Still worth it though.</li>
    <li> None of the bristles fall out! And they are also gentle on sensitive skin. Great for the price! : )</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are so synthethic that they are rough. I don&#x27;t recommend it to sensitive skin. The powder and the blush brushes are the worst.There are not smooth. I regret my purchase because it was mainly for these brushes that I brought the whole. I recommend the others that is what explain the 2 stars I gave.</li>
    <li> Not much shedding and the brushes are soft.</li>
    <li> Good for begginers. Look a little cheap but otherwise. Very good</li>
    <li> great assortment of brushes.</li>
    <li> Great product especially for the price. Hairs stay put and hold up over time</li>
    <li> good for your first brush set</li>
    <li> these brushes will get the job done for maybe a pre teen/ teen who is just beginning in makeup but that&#x27;s where it ends!! A lot of the brushes that come in the set I have barely used twice but are falling apart! For the money it was a steal but not for me. I will be passing along these brushes to my teen sister and investing a some decent brushes!</li>
    <li> This brush set is a great value. It has every kind of cosmetic brush I will ever need! I have not used them all yet, but those I have used work very well. Each brush comes in its own individual package instead of all the brushes being loose in one package, so they arrived in perfect condition. Highly recommend seller, and will order again myself.</li>
    <li> love this product. brushes are good quality for the price.they are a little soft, and no powder/blush brush but overall for price can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter-in-law. Her sister liked it so much, I bought another set for her. After playing with them, I&#x27;ll be buying another set for myself.</li>
    <li> Great price but I have had to glue them together many times. I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, though.</li>
    <li> Love my make up brushes! I&#x27;ve had them now for about 2 years. With proper cleaning and care, they have definitely gotten the job done!</li>
    <li> I think one of my brushes might have broken within the first week, but it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. Little bit of glue and it was fixed.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes hold together nicely, I rarely find a hair on my face from them ( though it does happen once in a while ) but, if you&#x27;re a little low on cash and you can&#x27;t afford a full Sigma set, I suggest getting this one until you can.&lt;br /&gt;No real complaints with it.&lt;br /&gt;Edit; I realised soon after writing this that the stray hairs from the brush started appearing a lot more often. I would not recommend this brush set. It&#x27;s definitely worth paying more money for their studio set, or going and buying a Real Techniques set. These are stiff, they shed, and they easily break off. The only ones worth getting are their eye brushes. All their face ones, with the exception of the concealer brush, shed like crazy. Just. Keep that all in mind before purchasing.</li>
    <li> This is a full set of individually wrapped ELF brushes. I haven&#x27;t used them all, but was pleased that a variety of brushes I haven&#x27;t found locally were included. For simple applications or more dramatic looks these brushes hold up.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of brushes for every need! Only problem for me is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my makeup case.....Otherwise, awesome deal!</li>
    <li> Ok I have a lot of ELF products but I have to say I don&#x27;t like these white handle brushes. Some of them feel too soft and hard to handle, others too hard. I washed the big powder brush and it&#x27;s completly lost its shape and it feels like I should of added conditioner to it lol. I hate that I don&#x27;t like them because I love all the other products. I did get one of the mineral brushes from a beauty bundle and you can tell that that black handle one is much better quality than the white handle ones. I think each other the white brushes sold separately are $1 and the black handle sold separately are $3. I recommend people spend a little more and purchase the black handle ones from elf.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought these brushes, they&#x27;re great quality and they&#x27;re very aesthetically pleasing. If you&#x27;re a gal like me that loves make-up brushes of great quality without having to pay for the over the top price of more &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; brushes, then you&#x27;ll love these too. :)</li>
    <li> A lot of brushes! I don&#x27;t use them all. Easy to clean. Love how each brush was packaged individually and told you what it is used for.</li>
    <li> I never knew how much difference just the right brush can make. I am 57 and need to avoid make-up problems. These brushes add just the right amount of color to my face flawlessly. I really enjoy the eye brush and the smaller bronzer brush.</li>
    <li> Given I was able to get all these brushes for such a great price, I think I should not be surprised that two of the brushes have already come apart - the handles have come off the aluminum part and I have had to glue them back together.</li>
    <li> l ;love e;f and this has a brusjh for every need</li>
    <li> This is a really nice set to have for extra brushes. They  aren&#x27;t my favorite but they are good for backups. and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Just okay for the price</li>
    <li> arrived on time. some brushes were good quality, soft. others, the powder brushes, were rough and a little disappointing. overall they were alright. no regrets.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t use all the brushes but the ones i do use are great. i mean they are not the best quality ever because they are so cheap but they are definitely worth the buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit. The brishes from my opinion are good quality. It has about everything you need. The only thing I disliked is the fact that there is a strong chemical smell with the plastic and stuff. It gave me a headache. Buyer beware if you have children or god forbit buy this for a younger person, that chemical smell is toxic.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes, I love that they come individually packaged.</li>
    <li> The brushes feel soft and the bristles were all intact without any that looked loose.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! A brush for everything, easy to clean, not cheap feeling</li>
    <li> still got them from a year ago</li>
    <li> This set came as a slight disappointment to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the Pro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice variety of brushes&lt;br /&gt;-The orange/yellow brushes use good high-quality bristles&lt;br /&gt;-Love that this came w/a smudger which I find absolutely necessary after applying eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-The brown brushes use cheap, low-quality bristles. You can see and feel the coarseness of the bristles and they are also kinda falling out.&lt;br /&gt;-I gave these brown bushes to my little girl cousins who can use them as play makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not worth it if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality set, unless you don&#x27;t mind picking out the good brushes in which case the price may make it worthy.  Totally worth it if you&#x27;re buying for young girls just starting out with makeup, or just playing pretend.</li>
    <li> These are okay brushed for the pricing. They shed a lot after I washed them. I recommend for someone who is starting out with makeup but definitely not for a professional</li>
    <li> Worked Great, still continuing to use</li>
    <li> Comprises of all the brushes. Really worth it</li>
    <li> This is an absolute GREAT buy! To be honest, most E.L.F brushes, if not all, are great buys. Comes with everything you need especially if you&#x27;re just starting your makeup collection. There&#x27;s a brush for your eyebrows, eyelashes, powder brushes, eyeshadow brushes, fan brush which is great for bronzing and blush and there&#x27;s an angle brush. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
    <li> I was reticent about the quality of these brushes because they were so cheap, but must say I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived.  The brushes come in individually labelled (yes, they are labeled according to their purpose, which is great for makeup beginners) plastic sheaths that seem to be well-constructed, so you can keep them stored in their individual sheaths.  The brushes themselves seem to be well made and comparable to more expensive brushes I own (such as origins and mac).  The price is even better, as the entire set is still cheaper than a single professional brush typically costs.</li>
    <li> VERY FAST SHIPPING!! GREAT QUALITY BRUSHES FOR AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. I&#x27;D DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Ive worked at a dept store make up counter and i know those brushes can get expensive and i also know that a nice brush means helps. I really like the eye shadow brushes they are really nice and help hold the color on them. I hate when i have to keep applying to get it to the color of the eye shadow on my eyelid. Its usually because the brush doesn&#x27;t want to hold any shadow. the foundation brush is also nice and you cant beat the price for all of these brushes together either.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes on a daily basis. They are pretty good brushes for a beginner. Brushes are soft yet firm and are each labeled for easy use. If you are like me and don&#x27;t have $50-$150 to spend on professional brushes, then these are a great alternative to use for the time being. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. Also I noticed other reviews that people complained about a chemical odor. I did not have that issue. Each brush came nicely individually wrapped. Brushes have kept their shape and have NOT lost any hair. Fast shipping/ 7 days.</li>
    <li> This was a very economical brush set. It is very nice quality and very complete. I bought it for my young teenage daughter who is just starting to dabble in makeup and she loves it. For the price it was a very extensive set so now she can experiment with all the different brush features. Well made ,excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> I love love love these brushes!Even though each of them are labeled for a certain job they can also be used for other purposes in makeup application.They are so versatile! I love this set!</li>
    <li> Great for the price, but the only ones I use regularly are the eyeshadow brushes because the bristles fall out on the face ones.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. The good thing about them is that they work just as good as any other high priced brush set.  I just wished they would have the brush guards on the smaller brushes, like they do the larger ones. They do not come in a case or bag, so  keep that in mind. Mine came in a plastic clear package. Great brushes .</li>
    <li> These are not good quality. The brushes will scratch your face off. Don&#x27;t buy them. I threw mine out, they were that bad. I understand you get what you pay for, but this is their business, they set the low prices, so don&#x27;t blame me for expecting a quality product regardless of their prices.</li>
    <li> Lovely brushes and a very good buy for the $. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Happy to finally have a set of good brushes. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on amazon by far!</li>
    <li> Gave to my daughter for her birthday....my other daughter was so jealous had to order another set for her.  My wife recommended and she worked at a cosmetics counter at a large retailer...she thought these were as good as sets that sold for 3 times as much.</li>
    <li> Amazing service and great brushes</li>
    <li> i have had these for a year now and they are amazing!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes and they are good quality in my opinion for the price. They function excellently and all the brushes that were listed came.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I&#x27;m in love from the individual packaging of very brush and it was delivered very quick and I&#x27;m super excited about using my new brushes.</li>
    <li> As a beginner, these brushes are very good. Arrived fast and are good quality from what I can tell</li>
    <li> Very nice set of brushes, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good, and varied! The overall value is really awesome, and the brushes really help me to put my makeup on and help it look like nothing is even there! The only thing I am unhappy with is that the brushes have now started to fray a little bit even though I haven&#x27;t had them very long. I wish they were longer lasting, but overall I&#x27;m very happy with the value of this brush set.</li>
    <li> Not bad. My wife said &amp;#34;Great starter set or travel set, eye brushes are awesome but I&#x27;m not to keen about the full face one, it&#x27;s not as soft as my old ones&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great brushes for price.</li>
    <li> Bad quality brushes. I expected more Since the reviews were good.</li>
    <li> For me these work great. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up and certainly not everyday so these last a longtime. Good quality.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible value - 12 nice quality brushes, various sizes and types and very pleased with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Made with animal hair.  If that was disclosed, I would not have purchased.  They say they are cruelty-free/vegan... they are not.&lt;br /&gt;Buy Elf&#x27;s other brushes from their Studio line - those are truly cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;Also - Synthetic brushes last longer and are more hygienic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a couple of years now. I love them. They are all still in great shape and wash up great.</li>
    <li> I needed a set of brushes and these work well good quality easy to use. Makeup goes on easily, good coverage.</li>
    <li> For the price you just can&#x27;t beat these brushes.  I love them. I have gotten so many more compliments on my makeup because I take the time to use every brush. Great product. Even bought them for my daughter. She loves them</li>
    <li> Great quality for such a cheap price and very useful for beginners! Wish it came with a package to hold all the brushes though, aside from that wonderful.</li>
    <li> I like nice brushes, like MAC or the better Sephora ones.  But sometimes you don&#x27;t have a lot to spend, and you need a brush.  My favorite ELF brushes are the long shadow brushes and the concealer brushes.  The face brushes do shed a little, though I&#x27;ve had MAC and Sephora brushes that shed a bit at first, too.  But these are soft, easy to handle, and do a nice job.  Definitely worth it for the money.</li>
    <li> Great brushes but for beginners, I bought these to learn the basics of make up and make up tools.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are very soft but also &#x27;shed&#x27; very easily, so you have to be careful when cleaning them.</li>
    <li> You shouldn&#x27;t expect much from a brush set that comes to about a dollar a brush. The brushes are pretty coarse (especially the face brush-- it&#x27;s gotten so irritating to the point that I&#x27;m willing to spend as much as I paid for this whole set on just one face brush that won&#x27;t make my face feel as if I&#x27;ve fallen on a porcupine). The eye brushes shed and I find myself always having to brush the hair fallout from my cheeks with something else; it&#x27;s like every time I get rid of one, another one magically shows up somewhere else. They do the minimum job and for the amount I paid, I suppose I can&#x27;t complain much. Now that I&#x27;m getting more into makeup, I&#x27;ll be saving up for a set of quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I love some of the brushes way more than others. The bigger pieces, like the big fluffy brush and the concealer brush, will get a ton of use. The others are a mixed bag in terms of quality and practicality. I use these for performance makeup. Some of the smaller brushes fell apart on first use, but the large ones I mentioned earlier get used almost every day.</li>
    <li> Want AMAZING brushes but have no money!? Buy these beauties. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a makeup artist I recommend these brushes if you don&#x27;t feel like spending $40 a brush. You can do the same, for $39 less. I promise.</li>
    <li> I only use a handful of the brushes, but for the price I couldn&#x27;t pass them up.  One of the tops did fall off, but it was an easy fix with a dab of hot glue.</li>
    <li> The brushes shed a lot and they tend to shift in the packaging, causing the bristles of the brush to bend (I&#x27;ve yet to get them to regain their shape).  I actually got this brush set from Walgreens and I wish I hadn&#x27;t!  I fell for the cheap price and I had heard some good things about these brushes online, so I went for it.  The brushes started to shred as soon as I took them out of the container!  Low quality - you really get what you pay for - cheap brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going to save up for a better set.</li>
    <li> Good value for money but the brush set isnt the best quality. One of the brushes was slightly damaged. It popped out of its handle but I was able to put it back easily! However I am happy to have a variety of brushes in order to experiment with looks.</li>
    <li> Nice addition to my trunk, but the Foundation Brush was broken. A little gorilla glue or epoxy to re-attach is all it will take, but will possibly try another set from another maker next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 1st time user of make-up period and I just love these brushes their exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for and their so easy to clean.</li>
    <li> There is a brush for each need, and they are just enough for the everyday makeup. Great relation price/quality. Worthy.</li>
    <li> The bristles for this brushes are a little rough. I strongly recommend getting the black set from E.l.f. which is a thousand times better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned expensive an inexpensive makeup brushes. Frankly these E.l.f. ones do the job -- just about any job you need done. They wash out beautifully and they look professional quality even though they are such a low price. If not for the price tag, I honestly wouldn&#x27;t have known these weren&#x27;t mid-to-high-end brushes. They make putting makeup on a lot more fun and a lot less messy. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> These are a decent product offered by E.l.f. $12 for a 12 pack of brushes. They are good quality and clean well. I like the foundation brush and they seem sturdy. Great inexpensive gift idea for women because of the variety of brushes you get with it. And the handles are clearly marked for the brush purpose. Definitely a good set to have for Halloween makeup or as a starter kit.</li>
    <li> Well this is my first brush set, and its great because is written in each the use. Im a beginner so its more easy whit instructions.</li>
    <li> not the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned but for the price, very very good</li>
    <li> The brushes are to soft for me to apply my make-up so that&#x27;s why the stars are so low from me.</li>
    <li> very soft and comfortable to use</li>
    <li> This collection seems to have every cosmetic brush known to woman accept the triangular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Renee Evers</li>
    <li> i love this,it very nice</li>
    <li> got it for my bfs lil sis and she like them says theyre soft and work well for blending i also got this to go with the bh 120 color palette</li>
    <li> Works very well for the price! But I have sensitive skin, and the facial brush is very corse and hurts my face to put on powder.</li>
    <li> For the price, these  brushes are excellent.  They come individually packaged, which was a pleasant surprise.  My brushes had no unpleasant odor, except for a slight smell of plastic in which theyre packaged.  This wears off a minute or two after taking the brush out of its sleeve.  No hairs fell out of any of the brushes.  I recommend purchasing the E.L.F. Daily Brush Cleaner.  It works great on the brushes to remove any makeup residue.  I would recommend these brushes to any person on a budget looking for great makeup brushes at a reasonable cost!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with all theses brushes and even more impressed with the price.  Buy these if you need brushes and you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great buy, more brushes than I can use, got just what was advertised. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. If you&#x27;re looking for a good brush set-here you go!</li>
    <li> The eye brushes are great, the foundation brush is awesome,  the bronzer/blush brush is ok... kinda rough, but it does its purpose, and it&#x27;s not terrible to use. The total face brush is another story.  When I opened up my package it was broken (the handle fell off), the brush sheds like crazy, and it&#x27;s incredibly rough. All the brushes were either great or decent with the exception of the total face brush, but for a cheap brush set, I don&#x27;t have any regrets on buying it... it&#x27;s a pretty good set for twelve dollars...</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product because I thought it was a great deal with 12 brushes for just over 12 dollars. One brush for a dollar, why not? But of course.. cheap products don&#x27;t fail to let me down. So far, I&#x27;ve only used the foundation brush, eye shadow brush, and a couple big ones. The hairs on the brushes are ALL synthetic. The foundation brush especially is just a big blob of plastic that is way too harsh on the face. I would just go for the real technique or even a beauty blender. I wanted to give E.l.f. a try, but I guess not! I do NOT recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Those brushes are waste of money the broke before I even use them</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and they look amazing! I almost felt bad to have to dirty them up! They&#x27;re very good when it comes to applying all of the products I use. Although I&#x27;m not really a fan of the foundation brush that comes with the set, the bristles are still very soft and those of you who prefer to use that shape of brush will like it. The only real problem was that my eye defining angled brush had bristles that seemed to be stuck together with a kind of glue that wouldn&#x27;t come off, so I had to throw it out. But with how these brushes are inexpensive, I wont have any trouble replacing it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are okay, but not great.  Even after washing before first use they shed, and the quality is just not really there.  It is a get what you pay for situation, so for as inexpensive as they are, they are a good set to start out with until you figure out which brushes you go to and buy nicer of those.</li>
    <li> Great wish it came with the elf fan brush. Only the blush and powder brush sheds after a few wash but its a good starter kit</li>
    <li> Great selection! Each brush is labeled so you will know which one is which. A great starter set. The only drawback is that there is a distinctive smell right out of the package. Nothing that a wash (which you are supposed to do with your new brushes anyway) can&#x27;t cure.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;You can create a decent eye look with the small ones, I espically like the shader &amp; blending!&lt;br /&gt;And you can&#x27;t hate having 2 eyebrow brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;The big brown face brushes are horrendous!!!! Scratchy and flimsy, I didn&#x27;t even use them!&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush, it&#x27;s soft but the hairs aren&#x27;t so thing. I don&#x27;t use this type anyway.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush set, and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I used these brushes for a while, but the bristles are harsh on the fluffier brushes and have fallen out while trying to clean them. They&#x27;re cheaply made but not too bad; they do the trick.</li>
    <li> Great set to have as a starter kit.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set and the price is absolutely wonderful! I have had these in the past, so I knew they would be good. Shipping was fast, but I have Amazon Prime, so I&#x27;m not sure about regular shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set. I use Mac and urban decay products and I can say that these brushes make those products 10x more fun and easy to use. I&#x27;m buying these sets for my sisters too!</li>
    <li> It was like I was hoping but I suggest that the seller places the parts in one package with several connected pockets. On the other hand, it is convenient to have them separate (transportation issue).</li>
    <li> as much as I&#x27;d like to go out &amp; get those expensive brushes, I can&#x27;t afford it. these are just as good &amp; so much cheaper. yeah, the bronzer/blush brush could be better but hey, its cheap!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes. But the handles on the concealer brush and powder brush came off. No problem I just glued em back on. There were also some uneven hairs on other brushes so those just needed trimming. All in all a good set though.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time for a Christmas gift to my daughter.  I was amazed at the packaging of the brushes, as they were individually wrapped in nice protective sleeves (great for traveling).  And, there were so many brushes that I was able to divy them up between three of us and still cover most purposes.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love these products. First time user and will probably never use any other brand to apply my makeup! Also love how each brush is labeled for what it&#x27;s used for!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner so these are doing just fine. I pretty much know what each one is for so I&#x27;m good!!</li>
    <li> Brushes are pretty nice. Wide varity of different brushes (Two face brushes, multiple eye shadow ones, eyebrow/mascara brush, foundation brush). Just wish that the all over face one was a bit softer, it&#x27;s not course but I have used softer brushes in the past. Great set, espically if you are a make-up begginer!!</li>
    <li> Loved them. Everything came ok nothing broken and came fast. Simply lovely.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes for the price that it comes at, but some of the face brushes are scratchy. No irritation caused, just scratchy. Only complaint!</li>
    <li> Just a nice selection of brushes.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great, now I can throw out all of my old brushes</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my daughter for Christmas. She loves them!</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM...USE THEM EVERYDAY...GOOD QUALITY TOO</li>
    <li> I not a make up expert and I only wear a natural look so this set was far more than I need. I only use the bronzer brush, eyebrow brush, eye definer, full face brush, and concealer. There isn&#x27;t much shed but I suspect it I was to use it religiously it would leave little strands on my face.... I must say it blends my makeup well!!</li>
    <li> So far the brushes are holding together and make it very easy to apply my makeup. It is definitely worth the very cheap price!!! :)</li>
    <li> This packet has every brush if you ask me. I&#x27;m a novice so i love that they put the name for the particular brush on it.</li>
    <li> Never really ordered from Amazon but I was a SATISFIED CUSTOMER ! ☺️</li>
    <li> I had a few ELF brushes and I loved them but I needed more so I got these and I am very happy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;12 brushes without paying a arm and leg lol&lt;br /&gt;They are really soft but they do shed but not that big of a deal because it does not happen all the time.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with these brushes . My bronzer brush handle broke after 1 day , &amp; they are shedding bad .</li>
    <li> we are happy with the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been regularly using the eyeshadow blending brush and the eyelash comb for about a month now and they both get the job done although I would&#x27;ve liked the comb bristles to be more defined to better separate my lashes. I don&#x27;t use the other brushes as much because I find that they have a slightly rough and bristly feeling to it. Either that, or I just don&#x27;t wear the type of makeup that requires using those brushes. If you don&#x27;t own any other brushes at all, I think they&#x27;re a good complete set to own for the price. They have a lovely sleek look to them but there was quite a bit of brush hair fallout, considering the fact that they&#x27;re new. My eyeshadow blending brush also had some sort of powdery substance on it when I removed it from its packaging but washing and desanitizing it was easy. Delivery time took about 2 weeks and I live in Australia so this is quick for me :)</li>
    <li> CHEAP... Brushes are falling apart. Literally the silver part that connects to the would handle came broken off. Not sure if it was packaging or what.. .</li>
    <li> I like this set of brushes but two have already fell apart. The large brushes loses hairs when I use it. The smaller brushes are much better and I like using those. Good deal considering how many you get.</li>
    <li> I use a few of these brushes every day, but this kit contains a TON of brushes. They are all soft and I it was a great value for the amount of product I received.</li>
    <li> all i can say is that i absolutely luv this brush set !! it is my favourite everyday set .. excellent product</li>
    <li> These are great first brushes! However.. if you&#x27;re looking to build your current brush arsenal, I would skip.</li>
    <li> For the price. its amazing. i love it and use it everyday. Thanks so much for this product, love it!</li>
    <li> Many of the brushes fell apart during first use and has to be tossed out.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations, 3 weeks after I receive the brushes, they are falling apart, very disappointed 😔😔. Not a good quality</li>
    <li> YASSSS! Some of the best brushes I have ever used! E.l.f is such a good product</li>
    <li> this brush set was great! only thing when i wahed them after using them with watter the hairs started to come of (little bits ) but they where great  ❤💜💙💚❤</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I have ever ever ever had.. EVER!! lol They are easy to use and easy to clean!! They ever have their uses imprinted on them which is a total plus! These brushes individually are anywhere from $&amp; to $28, so getting all 12 together like this for a low low price is unbelievable! GET IT WHILE YOU CAN IF YOU CAN</li>
    <li> This is indeed good value, $12 for 12 makeup brushes. Each brush has its name/use stamped on the handle and each clear plastic pack comes with description on usage, great for newbies. Read through packagings, they are made in China but couldn&#x27;t find the material so I guessed synthetic. I washed all of them before use with a brush cleaner and dried them lying flat. 10 brushes (the denser, short and firm ones eg foundation brush, defining eye brush, shadow brush, blending brush etc) retained their shape and no shedding and felt really soft on the face. But the total face brush shed some, and the shape is not exactly a nice round dome, in fact its fairly uneven, like some1 snipped at it with a scissors. I took a pic but regret unable to load it. The bronzing brush, shed a few strands but the brush head flared out. I slipped them both into the brush guards (available from Amazon) and after 24 hrs, brushes kinda &#x27;close&#x27; back a bit. Both brushes felt mildly scratchy on the face unlike the others in the set. Hope they won&#x27;t shed again by the next wash. In general, still very good value, for the remaining 10 brushes. Better than some drug store/generic brushes.</li>
    <li> Awesome set! I really love all the brushes here and it&#x27;s really good for the price. My favorite is the eyeshadow brush~</li>
    <li> they are great and you save so much money paying them there then in stores one by one. they are great and they work great. i would buy them again</li>
    <li> The brushes shed. I have purchased E.l.f products in stores and never had that problem before. I am not sure why buying them in a set would make them less quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent products for the quantity and the price. You do get what you pay for and maybe even a bit more. I do not favor the concealer brush so I purchased a separate more expensive one of more quality since this is my main brush. The products of course aren&#x27;t excellent, but how can you complain when you want to be cheap buying standard products? If there is a complaint, purchasing of the more expensive, higher quality products should be your route. In my view this is a deal.</li>
    <li> Amazing set. I have been using ELF products for the last 12 months and love them. They are a great sturdy brand. I was surprised, since I first purchased the brand at Target really cheap and they had promotion sets that were beyond low priced. The tools are sturdy and have held up well. I bought this set because I wanted more brushes for my different eye shadows. The brushes wash great and hold their shape, I use Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash to clean but I am sure any soap or shampoo would do.</li>
    <li> Amazing set of brush! Perfect</li>
    <li> The price and quantity cannot be beat!  There are so many brushes in this package - a brush for everything.  However, I did notice that the eye shadow brushes let off a lot of little hairs/bristles on my face.  That is the reason for the 3 star rating.</li>
    <li> I was using these for painting.. my opinion is irrelevant. but they are decent quality as far as I can tell</li>
    <li> I am just starting to really care about my makeup and I wanted a good brush set and this is perfect. I LOVE E.L.F. Great items for awesome prices. 12 brushes for $12 is perfect. The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed, and pick up all powdered items very well. I just wish they came with an actual pouch to put them in, but that&#x27;s no big deal. They are all beautiful, full size brushes!</li>
    <li> great brushes for the fraction of the price you would expect- I would recomend getting it especially if you aren&#x27;t ready (or don&#x27;t have the funds to purchse expensive brushes)</li>
    <li> I bought this set because I&#x27;m trying out different brushes and what work really best for me. They are pretty good brushes. The face brush isn&#x27;t really soft and like an &amp;#34;aww&amp;#34; feeling against your face its more like a pokey &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; kinda thing. Thats the only thing I really don&#x27;t like. The bronzer brush isn&#x27;t really sturdy its really soft/flimsy and not of fan of that so thats why I gave it 4 stars. But for the price and for all the brushes you get it really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> Great set for the amatur makeup artist. Every brush is labeled for what you can use it for.  It is a lot easier to apply my makeup now using this set.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes, I recently started using make up ( and i am 23) and these brushes are so soft and durable and they are worth the price....... I LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brushes are loose and get all over my face. It does the job, but I hate the sensation of brush bristles on my face!</li>
    <li> I love it! Great price, good quality and now that I am using the brushes for put on the make up it really looks different. I still need to learn about some of the brushes but the overall use is great.</li>
    <li> I liked the wide variety of brushes that came with the set. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that now, after a couple months of use, the bristles are starting to fall off some of the brushes. But then again...I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> A great buy! Great quality 💁🏽</li>
    <li> So far these brushes are wonderful. My favorites are the flat foundation brush (which I used for liquid foundation), and the all over face brush (which I used for powder). My least favorite is the blusher/bronzer brush. In my opinion its of lower quality than the rest, the bristles are flimsy and don&#x27;t apply nearly as well. This is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars. Other than that, they are great and definitely worth the twelve dollars!</li>
    <li> these brushes are my favorite! i use them every single day! but if you get them you really should clean them after every use with the elf brush cleaner.. the ends like to sick together some times if they arent cleaned (:</li>
    <li> 1.fast shipping ordered on the 24th of jan 2014 got it on the 28th&lt;br /&gt;2. Brushes are just like the pic and are extremely soft&lt;br /&gt;3.brushes are all tight to the shaft none coming off&lt;br /&gt;4.all brushes labeled so if your a beginner you know what to do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I want everyone to know is do not use these brushes before washing them they have some type of weird powder on them when I washed the water turned brown initially but after wash they are good to go lastly please note all brushes will have a \\&quot;new brush smell\\&quot; from being package in plastic when you wash an fair dry smell will go away other than this brushes are amazing</li>
    <li> E.L.F. is a cheap and some what good quality. Good for everyday use or in a pinch.</li>
    <li> eeeh, only use 3 out of the 12...</li>
    <li> For what they are as brushes to start out with, I&#x27;m very happy. Make sure to clean any new brushes before use :-p</li>
    <li> This set is perfect for the young lady on the go in into make up. My daughter loved it. Thank you AMAZON.COM</li>
    <li> Ehhhh this is ok.....kind of crap though. This would be good for a starting off make up person or for a travel stage makeup kit.</li>
    <li> they are so complete.</li>
    <li> I had a few of the brushes already but wanted to try the ones i could never find in stores.I love the eye shadow blending brush with all my heart, the concealer brush, and smudging sponge are great. The only downs are the big face brush is horrible and the packaging smells like paint thinner, otherwise they are great!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. As a future makeup artist, it&#x27;s great, affordable, &amp; the brushes are soft and of decent quality!</li>
    <li> Never again, they shed and a few of them HURT. The bristles are prickly but it&#x27;s to be expected for the price so what more can I say.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the brushes. You can&#x27;t beat that price for all of them either!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> These brushes sell at Walmart for $1 a piece, and they are much better then a set of 21 brushes that I ordered from China from a Groupon deal, that I could not return, and had to throw out. They were stiff and didn&#x27;t grab the pigment of the make-up, and just useless to the point that I gave them to Good Will.  You are not going to get any brushes for a buck a piece, for better then these E.L.F. prices. So, don&#x27;t complain, just buy some more expensive brushes if you want a higher quality, but I do not advise from China, b/c they probably use Dog or Cat hair in their brushes. Try for synthetic Brushes if ordering from China. U.S. hair brushes are used from livestock, and in a much more Humane manner.</li>
    <li> They brushes are not bad at all, however for a professional mua, they are not ideal.. For me the are too ting and the handles are short as compared to other brands..they did arrived on time...</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her brushes - she uses them everyday. and is please with the make of them as well.</li>
    <li> I know these brushes are inexpensive but they literally fall apart when I try to apply makeup. Dozens of bristles come out each time, I can&#x27;t even use these at all. I wish I would be able to return them still honestly.</li>
    <li> bad very verryyyyyyyyyy baddddd</li>
    <li> These were flaky and shedding as soon as I started using it. But t is perfect for anyone starting out</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They don&#x27;t come apart and they spready makeup perfectly</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! Great quality and awesome price! I have bought several e.l.f cosmetics and I absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> Nothing special - they&#x27;re great brushes. I got one brush that was totally used and broken, but I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re already a fan of ELF you will know what to expect. These are all the ELF brushes you could ever want for fraction of the grocery store price. Sick of searching for a replacement at Walmart because they&#x27;re always sold out? Buy this now, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> A brush for everything, high quality for the price. I use these brushes every day! Blends powders really well and dosnt seem to shed.</li>
    <li> The bristles fall out really easily and frequently. However, they were really cheap and I feel they are a good purchase for the price. Be warned though if you&#x27;re looking for a really nice set of cosmetic brushes that will last a long time, these are it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas present for my sister and this is exactly what I was looking for her! it was packaged carefully and arrived very quickly, actually a day ahead of when it was suppose to.</li>
    <li> The larger brushes were painful to use. I like the smaller brushes though. I would not suggest this to a friend at all. Also, the foundation brush did not work at all! It was like trying to paint with a chewed up paint brush!!</li>
    <li> Purchased for oldest daughter for Christmas gift.  She had it on her &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34;.  The Amazon Wish List is AWESOME! She was very happy with this gift....had to look at every one of the brushes before opening another gift.  Thanks Amazon.com  for making Christmas shopping soooo much easier!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the packaging of this item, each brush was individually wrapped in a nice clear plastic case and it was boxed with care! I am a huge fan of elf brushes and these are great quality for the price and quantity! It shipped on the day it estimated to, and is great quality. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy a nice brush kit, comes with a the essentials needed for doing a full set Of makeup! I am very pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone :)</li>
    <li> Great brushes, worth the money</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. They are soft and apply product well. I clean my brushes often, the brushes came apart over time. Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> They say it is a poor carpenter that blames his tools, but sometimes good tools really do make all the difference.  I have used cheap brushes my entire life and finally decided to get some quality tools.  They make such a huge difference in the way my make-up is applied and how I&#x27;m able to manipulate my products.  I also love how each brush package is labeled with it&#x27;s name and how you should use it.</li>
    <li> this brushes are everything, i swear! i use them everyday &amp; shipping was fast so that&#x27;s what i really liked also i use them everyday for make up, their great with my skin so i like them. i totally recommend</li>
    <li> This has everything you need and it cheap. I love this product and would recommend it to everybody. I hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> These are very soft brushes and great to use if you&#x27;re just now getting into make up.</li>
    <li> Shipping was faster than I had expected and I was a little worried that these brushes would be low-quality, assuming from the price. This was my first purchase from the Elf brand and I actually purchased an Elf palette along with these brushes. I was surprise to receive these brushes in a little pouch for each brush. I really liked how it stated what each brush was for on the brushes as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are amazing and they&#x27;re great for the price! I&#x27;m very satisfied with these brushes and I will buy them again as gifts for my family!!!</li>
    <li> Great set here, you get all you need and then some.  I bought this set for halloween makeup and decided that most of the brushes I needed to incorporate into my daily routine!!</li>
    <li> Good price. Pretty good brushes</li>
    <li> These are not expensive brushes as you can see by the Price...but they do the job and do it right. I have had them since a year now and not even one brush has broke...i wash them with baby shampoo and rinse and take really good care of them...the perfect set!</li>
    <li> have used some but not all very pleased with the product they seem to be very well made if you are looking for a nice cosmetic set i would recommend it</li>
    <li> More than I hoped for!! Great, I&#x27;m very pleesed!!!</li>
    <li> I was glad to find that all of the brushed are labeled! I am not that familiar with makeup brushed since I haven&#x27;t really started using them until now. So if I forget what one is for all I have to do is look at the handle. They also are really good quality, my makeup has looked better and smother these past two days then it ever has.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say this is one of the best investment I&#x27;ve made on amazon for makeup at least. Love how they come individually pack with title. PERFECT! I currently still use some iteams Mostly the blending brush.</li>
    <li> A great little set for the price, well worth a buy.  I like that it came with a spooly as those can be hard to come by and often cost $10 alone.  The larger brushes are o-k, I have better large brushes than this, but you cannot beat the small brushes in this set.  ALL the small brushes are amazing for eyeshadow and concealer.  I would say if you need a cheap starter or filler set, go with this but know you&#x27;ll need some larger brushes of a better quality.</li>
    <li> This set is wonderful for any kind of make up user, from experienced to beginner. These brushes are soft, pick up product well and very durable (no shedding-if used properly or a little rough I&#x27;m no saint when it comes to storing my brushes). This set is worth the money (and much cheaper than other brush sets out there) and are comparable to the more expensive ones on the market. I would recommend to every make up user out there!</li>
    <li> I have never felt this beautiful using these brushes. They made me go from a complete zero to a absolute hero. All the guys want me. If your a young single woman and looking for a young strappin man I totally recommend these</li>
    <li> This set was purchased as a gift for my daughter.  I was a little disappointed that there was no case for them, but the brushes themselves seem to be of good quality of the price.</li>
    <li> This is such a good price for this quality set. I bought one for my daughter who is just starting to use make-up.</li>
    <li> Ordered these brushes on Monday (Dec16th) received it today Thursday (Dec19th). Pretty fast delivery. Smell a little funny but other than that the brushes seem really good. I gave them 4 stars b/c I haven&#x27;t used them.</li>
    <li> Great price for such excellent we&#x27;ll made brushed. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for good quality lasting makeup brushes</li>
    <li> I bought these makeup brushes as a gift and was very pleased! This is a good value for twelve brushes. I was glad to find this set of full sized brushes considering that the brush sets you find it stores are usually travel sized and are of equal or similar cost! The brushes smell a bit like plastic from the cases they are in, but it is not overwhelming and goes away quickly. I recommend these brushes to anyone looking for an inexpensive yet good quality makeup brush set</li>
    <li> Well, don&#x27;t compare with the $200 set of-course, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price. To give away to your girls in relatives, they&#x27;ll be thrilled. If you are into skin care and around over 40 right now, like me, the brushes may be a bit rough on your thinning and sensitive skin around the eyes in the morning, just use your finger. Otherwise, invest in $200 over sets from Goss.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money!  By far the worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I didn&#x27;t expect them to be very good, but I wanted a second set to travel with that I wouldn&#x27;t be upset if they were lost.  After I opened them I tried using a few of them...they were so bad that they all went in the trash.  :(</li>
    <li> I have had so much fun playing with my brushes. The hairs don&#x27;t fall out or itch, which is great.</li>
    <li> 12 pieces are totally enough for a new user and it is a complete set of blushes unless you are a professional user</li>
    <li> work very good...loves this brushes.  A+</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed, and super soft. Make sure to wash and condition it before use as with any brushes that will be use for face</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great value for the price. I bought them as a gift for my little sister and they are a great starter set. I liked them so much that I ended up purchasing a second set.</li>
    <li> Obviously not the highest quality, but they do not fall apart or shed relentlessly and they hold make-up well.&lt;br /&gt;For the cost, they are surprisingly good brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushers were better than expected.  I love the white handles and the way they are individually wrapped upon delivery.  I bought the pack for the foundation brush but I love the sponge applicators and the concealer brush and blending brush which I didn&#x27;t have.  A great give and a great purchase.  Bought on prime so no tax or shipping charges....just $12!  Going to buy my daughters both one!  The only other brushes I needed were an angled eyeliner brush  from Sephora and a powder brush from Elf which I also like.</li>
    <li> I love love love this! I highly recommend it to every woman out there who loves make up! It&#x27;s labelled with instructions on what the brushes are used for &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft and their application is very smooth. No shedding from the brushes or anything. Perfect amount of brushes in package not to many not to little. Great for beginners in makeup</li>
    <li> I was surprised about how nice each brush is, and I loved the separate packaging that they came in when I opened the box. they also look very professional.</li>
    <li> Cheap price, decent quality. Many of my brushes have fallen apart from their handles and bristles fallen out. Still very much usable and would buy again at this price point</li>
    <li> Love these, love the fact that each brush has written on it, its use. I am learning this make up thing, and this made it so much easier, not having to figure out which brush should be use for what.</li>
    <li> Some of these brushes are great, like the small concealer brush and the blending eye brush but I ended up not needing to use all of them. The foundation brush broke so easily and I did not feel the hairs were sturdy enough. Here&#x27;s a tip, go to your local target (wherever they sell e.l.f brushes) and buy the brushes you think you will definitely need. They are $1.00 each. That way you are not spending money on the tools you don&#x27;t need. And if you end up needing a specific brush it doesn&#x27;t hurt to spend an extra $1 on an additional tool to your set. I recommend this for people who want to experiment with makeup. This was a great start for me to get my hands in makeup.</li>
    <li> These are working out well. I am able to apply my makeup (eye, in particular) more precisely.</li>
    <li> I love this set. Each brush comes individually packaged which is great. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Came packaged together and individually wrapped they&#x27;re gorgeous got every brush I need now can&#x27;t beat this deal and they came super fast</li>
    <li> Amazing product with lots of great brushes that can really help you with your makeup style.</li>
    <li> Guys dont buy!!! Besides the fact that it sheds, people forgot to mention that the brushes are NOT SOFT AT ALL!! They literally hurt my face!!!</li>
    <li> The kit had the essentials but the brushes began to break after a while where the wand and brush met after one cleaning. The powder brush was rough on the skin also.</li>
    <li> Great product, It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out! very excited that they are good for what I paid!</li>
    <li> They leave strands of black hair onmy face &amp; on 4 of them the hhandles fell off just after a couple uses</li>
    <li> i like this brand i like how many brushes come for the price. i like them very much… people enjoy :)</li>
    <li> I ended up with two sets of these (crazy promos from the e.l.f. website). They&#x27;re not my favorite brushes, but they&#x27;re a good way to build up your collection if you&#x27;re starting from nothing. (I find the e.l.f. brushes that are sold individually and are a bit more expensive -- the ones with black handles -- to be higher quality.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used all of these yet. Thankfully, the intended purpose of each one is printed on the handle, because I&#x27;d never be able to guess for some of them. The eyeshadow brushes are fairly high quality; I have yet to find any bristles/hairs falling out of those. I find that the different colors of bristles relate somewhat to the texture. The darker brown bristles are a bit rougher than the golden-colored ones (but none are uncomfortable to use on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m less satisfied with the larger brushes (for example, the angled one that is second from left in the picture). They are not very thick/full, like some of the bristles came out before I even received them. They&#x27;ve also shed a little bit (although not so much I can&#x27;t use them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re pretty easy to clean; I use the e.l.f. brush cleaners (there&#x27;s a daily spray as well as a weekly shampoo) and hang upside down to dry (so as to prevent water from dripping onto the metal parts). I&#x27;d recommend drying hanging upside down (I have a brush hanger for this purpose) because it should prevent rust formation, which should in turn lead to a longer lifetime for these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, if you&#x27;re looking for inexpensive brushes, these are not a bad option. I can definitely see the day I move up to more expensive brushes, purchased individually. But this set has given me a good idea of which types of brushes I will use the most and it&#x27;s suited my needs well enough for the past couple of months.</li>
    <li> This 12 piece brush set is a great bargain! So many brushes for every type of application. Brushes are well made and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> the brushes are of poor quality, but I really don&#x27;t want to bother to return it。∩╮（︶︿︶）╭∩ .I strongly do not recommend it</li>
    <li> Happily surprise by the quality :) recommend it</li>
    <li> Great brushes. I use them daily and they don&#x27;t &#x27;shed&#x27; or lose quality.  I&#x27;ve had them a couple of months now. Worth the great price no doubt!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on high en makeup brushes and comparitively these stand up very well!  I bought this entire set a few years ago and didn&#x27;t end up using every brush, but it&#x27;s such a great deal that I didn&#x27;t mind.  Still in good shape and I use some every day.  Also bought some for my SIL.</li>
    <li> I love them so far they are amazing. The only downside is that when they get old the glue that holds them together wears out and the top of the brush falls off.you can always glue it back on and they still work the same even when they fall off. I love that they have the names of the brushes on them.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! &amp; my last brush set use to shed all the time - it was an expensive makeup line too - love that they are white too!</li>
    <li> Am totally satisfied with this product.  Have been using for like almost a year now and have absolutely no complaints.  The brushes are soft, but not too soft and they do what they say they will.  Love the smudger,  use it to blend colors.  I feel like a make pro using these brushes, they make doing my make up so much easier.  The lining brush is also worth mentioning.  Pretty thin and capable of drawing very thin line for the eyes.</li>
    <li> I so love my Cosmetics brushes. It was worth the buy. I also love how the names are on the brushes.... if these ever give out I will be reordering!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need all the brushes. I guess if you&#x27;re one of those people that uses a particular brush for different things it&#x27;s the perfect pack of brushes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my 13 year old beautiful niece last Christmas. She LOVES this set. I&#x27;m a happy Aunt :)</li>
    <li> Each one came individually wrapped and there were in very good condition. It is a good deal for the price and I use the brushes a lot. Only thing is the biggest brush isn&#x27;t super thick but everything else is good</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for - that is the case with these brushes. Good brushes for cheap. They are a little scratchy. The blush brush is small. But great variety and packaging.</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty ruff and they shed alot</li>
    <li> I loved it! great quality! delivered very fast!</li>
    <li> The brush heads themselves are nice and soft while holding their shape well. The problem is that the glue holding them to the handles is absolutely awful; it broke on every single brush (even the ones I don&#x27;t think I ever used). I still ended up using the brush-ends since they worked, but eventually replaced them with a different product.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive makeup brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy 12 brushes for 10 dollars. I did get what I paid for.. If you are a beginner in the makeup department these are perfect. Just about every brush you can use in your everyday routine. I like that on each brush it had its use so you wouldn’t be as confused as to which brush did what. BUT the brushes had a TERRIBLE smell to them. It was a factory, chemical smell. I have a recipe I use to clean my brushes that took the smell away and after that everything was fine. The brushes do shed a little, but they are 10 dollars…[Here is the recipe ; 1 tablespoon of white vinegar, 1 tablespoon of dish detergent (preferably Dawn or any degreaser), and 1 cup of hot water, let the brushes sit for about 20 minutes then rise and it works great!</li>
    <li> All of the little fake hairs falls off sometimes</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT set of brushes! Very high quality from handles to bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush comes individually packages in great quality packaging not just wrapped in cellophane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using these for a long time. Comes with every brush you will ever need to do complete make up and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I received my package really fast and that was good, but the package only contained 11 brushes, not 12 like it should have. They shorted me one brush, the small concealer brush was not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t have high expectation, so I was not too disapointed. I think I&#x27;ll just give this set away to my niece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about buying these, find something else, you could do better.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality for professionals but great for basic everyday use. The hairs in the blush brush started falling out so I just don&#x27;t use that one.</li>
    <li> I love the product, it gives me great results every time :D It blends everything so perfectly whether it be foundation or eye makeup</li>
    <li> So far its all good. I do like e.l.f products thats why i tried this and for a beginner like me. Its all okay!</li>
    <li> This is perfect, especially for beginners like me. Each brush comes in individual packaging with a description of what it is used for along with it. My only wish is that it had a blush brush. Everything seems very quality and I found no such strange smells or powder. Some of the bristles fell out at first as I was testing them but now they are reliable and lose no bristles with use.</li>
    <li> A large assortment of brushes for a great price. Good quality with no fibre/hair fallout.&lt;br /&gt;I was suprised to find a blush and bronze brush instead of two separate, which isn&#x27;t practical. I think I also expected some sort of storage case/bag for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Same brushes as sold in target, much better price. Not the highest quality but do the job, and are good for me since I tend to misplace things and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much. One of the eyeshadow brushes must have been a lemon as it sheds a ton, but most of them do not have this issue. Worth the $.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, I bought them for my teenage daughter and was so impressed I ordered another set for myself. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I love using these brushes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to experiment with eye makeup for quite sometime and knew I needed these brushes. When you go into Sephora, brushes like these would run for $22 or more! Buying these brushes here on Amazon was a much better deal. All these brushes for $11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can say I wish this had was a pointed crease brush.</li>
    <li> So i&#x27;m pretty new to make-up brushes so when i saw these i said to my self and i&#x27;m self said hum i said were gonna get those brushes and i did and they work fine. I like how in the packaging they all come individually in their own little cases and each plastic case has the name on it to let you know what kind of brush your using and the name of the brush is even on the handle, the only reason why this isn&#x27;t getting a 5 star rating is because some of the brushes shed. if they didnt shed then they would have gotten a 5 star from me.</li>
    <li> I bought this set month ago when I was building my makeup brush sets and did not want to spend a lot of money on them. I decided to give this set a try since it seemed affordable and reviews were not poop. Well...I personally dislike those brushes. They come in wrapped in plastic, smell horrible. Right off the back they start shedding even after you wash them first time around. Within a week of usage the handles started to come off...Bristles are not the softest especially on the face brushes. Honestly those brushes are very cheaply made :( Although I regret ever buying and using them, they taught me to value a good quality hence expensive brush. I used this set for 2 weeks and then it went to the trash. I came on Amazon and bought the Coastal Scents set which is 100 times better than elf brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes after using another brush set (which I like a lot. I have heard a lot of good stuff about E.l.f, so I decided to order the brush set.  In all honest, I did not like it at all. The powder brushes is way too flimsy and when I use it to apply my foundation it just does not come out the way I like it......I will continue to use E.l.f products just not their cosmetic brushes.</li>
    <li> Nice quanity of brushes for the money however the brushed scatch up my face due to some having hard bristles</li>
    <li> All the essential brushes. ELF is a really good brand and they work well.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for someone who isn&#x27;t a makeup professional, just a daily wearer.  I especially like the variety of eye shadow brushes (shading, liner, smudge, blending, etc.) because all I had before was a basic brush and used it for everything.  The only brush in this pack that I know I won&#x27;t use is the lip brush, but maybe I&#x27;ll play with it.  I&#x27;ll be using all these brushes this weekend for my wedding!</li>
    <li> A quality brand who does not test on animals…sign me up!</li>
    <li> I had thought this came with a carrying case for the brushes, But I must have been mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;It was a good deal for the brushes but would have been better if I had gotten what I thought I had ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Next time will read product descriptions more clearly</li>
    <li> For the price, this set is great and gets the job done. They are easy to clean and look great.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  This is a great varity of brushes and quality is there as well.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I used the foundation brush everyday for almost 2 years and I finally decided to get the set, it was a great choice. For your average, non-make up artist woman, these are perfect brushes for the basics. They apply great, I just wish they had a few different ones than available here. Overall, not a bad purchase at all!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them, they did smell the first time I used them but they dont anymore. They are perfect and smooth.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really great for the price. They are also individually labeled and packaged so if you&#x27;re not a make-up expert, you still know what brush is what.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, for just a short time. They didn&#x27;t last long as the bristles broke quickly and didn&#x27;t hold up to washings.</li>
    <li> I usually love e.l.f. products because they are often phenomenal quality for such a little bit of money but these brushes are really bad. I really hated applying makeup with the face brushes because they weren&#x27;t soft and they felt flimsy. For the first few weeks I had them they were alright. When you get to cleaning them, they start falling apart. The hairs start coming out (especially with the powder brush) to the pint where if you wash them once a week or every other week half the brush hairs fall out. Not only that, but the metal part starts to detach from the wood and I had to hot glue them back together a few times within the first few weeks. The eyeshadow brushes and lip brushes are fine but the face brushes are really not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want cheap brushes that are great quality and you are a beginner try eco-tools and if you are willing to spend a little bit more money try the real techniques brushes as well</li>
    <li> Best brush kit out there! Seriously 12 brushes for such a good price! Great quality, definitely recommend as it comes with brushes for everything for your beauty needs</li>
    <li> These e.l.f. brushes are great if you are a beginner, but they are not as soft as their professional brushes. However, they are great for the price and they get the job done!</li>
    <li> Great quality for it&#x27;s price- pretty much a dollar a piece. Great starting set. Love how each one is labeled with it&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> I love these!they work just as good as urban decay or mac brushes!</li>
    <li> Everything came as shown</li>
    <li> Great prices for the brush set.</li>
    <li> Great price, and most of the brushes are awesome. There are a few that are just OK. And one I threw away cuz it looked like there was something wrong with it and it felt rough. Overall  great buy.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t ask for much better quality. A few of the brushes have started to shed, but overall I really like these brushes. As a beginner to the makeup world, this is a great basic set with almost everything you need. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Decent brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> this was for my daughter and she loves it. It was what she wanted  to get thanks very much !</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my niece. They come individually wrapped, and marked as to what they do. I hope she loves them!</li>
    <li> I gave bad review on this seller. I just opened my gift and my daughter put it under the tree. I never saw it before tonight. Please forgive me because it was a big error on my part. I did get it and I love, great quality. A girl at MAC cosmetics told me these are just as good and better price. I have used them before and like them better the MAC brushes. This a great quality product to have not hard to keep them clean. They don&#x27;t shed like Mac.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set, you are getting pretty good quality brushes for the amount of money they are charging it is a steal! I love the eye shadow brushes the best!</li>
    <li> Started web cam modeling and needed something cheap to start off with. This set is great for the price i love it the big blended brush broke in half but Im heavy Handed so that was probably me lol</li>
    <li> I am in love with these brushes!  I don&#x27;t know how I made it without brushes for so long before these.  I use all except two or three.  They are a very nice quality for the price.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Good price, but the tips fell off of most of the brushes after very little usage</li>
    <li> This set is awesome for my daughter.  All the brush handles are labeled with their purpose.  She&#x27;s just learning about makeup.</li>
    <li> I love ELF products already, but if you haven&#x27;t used them yet, pick up a single brush to try at Target first. Cheap yet decent quality tools for every day makeup application.</li>
    <li> some brushes weren&#x27;t very soft considering they are face brush but besides the two big ones they are great!</li>
    <li> These brushes are really nice!  Every one of them is perfect for its purpose.  I especially like the eyebrow brush... they are all just super!</li>
    <li> Great for price.. use them everyday and have no issues</li>
    <li> These are great! They hold up as well as my really expensive MAC brushes and are a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> These are great for their price. I only wish the brushes were more sturdy and wouldn&#x27;t shed the hair on them. Otherwise they are very soft and work like a charm.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes a couple of months ago and one of them broke already.  The powder brush feels very abrasive against my face and it also sheds.  The eye brushes work pretty well for me.  Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these brushes again.</li>
    <li> The larger brushes aren&#x27;t soft. I hate how they feel against my skin. The bristles squish down and don&#x27;t rebound. I&#x27;m not impressed. I usually ADORE elf products. This left me very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with these products. I would have loved a little carry case for the price I paid, but all in all, these brushes are a great find, and are made with decent material. Yes I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was a little skeptical about it because I&#x27;ve never had real make-up brushes, by that I mean name brand ones... The first time I used the brushes my make-up was FLAWLESS! I looked stunning compared to how my make-up usually looks. The total face brush was a little rough but I think if I condition it, that may help.. The brushes did have a little bit of an odor but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all, I barely noticed. Overall a great purchase!</li>
    <li> These brushes are of poor quality! The hair comes out all over your bathroom vanity. My fiance always asks what the hell I do when I put make up that it makes such a mess. DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set and the upgrade to this set straight from elf. The black set is much better. Wait for a sale they go half off all the time. These brushes are good looking but very cheap. I have had to glue 2 of them back together. The larger blush brush isn&#x27;t very soft. I gave they black set to my daughter. It is much nicer</li>
    <li> I love it. Family friend saw and now she is wanting it. Bought because my daughter does pageants and needed a good brush set for it. VERY VERY quick shipping.</li>
    <li> These brushes are made with very soft bristles.. so soft that it&#x27;s hard to actually distribute any kind of product on your face because they bend so much. I love elf but these missed the mark for me.</li>
    <li> I had always used whatever brush came with the make-up I was using. I thought I would try these Elf brushes after reading great reviews. Not only is the price is great, these are quality brushes. You get a bunch of them-and the bristles do not fall out. It has really helped with my make-up application.</li>
    <li> Great quality of brushes for the price!!!!  No issues whatsoever.  I also like that the Brushes have what they are typically used for on them.  I&#x27;m not a total makeup guru so I find this helpful.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The are not the best quality but it&#x27;s functional for those people who are beginners</li>
    <li> Really great brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this set of brushes for my daughter since she wears make up for dance performances. This is a great set that comes with every make up brush you&#x27;d need and all are labeled so you know what they&#x27;re for. They are nice, sturdy brushes. Just what she needed. And a great price.</li>
    <li> I use all of these regularly and I love them. Exactly what I need and more to explore with.</li>
    <li> Work very well!! Shouldn&#x27;t get if you don&#x27;t use all the brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very cheap and flimsy I expected more.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth purchase of these brushes (for self and as gifts).  Plan on purchasing more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit. Love how it&#x27;s all labeled. Wish it came with a case but overall I love this set. It&#x27;s really perfect</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Great buy and quality. Cleaning is easy to do - Drunk brushes in warm water mixed with baby shampoo and leave at a downward angle to dry over night.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow brushes work nicely but I personally don&#x27;t like the big face brush, it doesn&#x27;t hold powder like I need it to.. I suppose it is worth the price though</li>
    <li> These brushes look really nice but are very cheap (like the price) and rough on the skin. The first time I used the eyeshadow brush the bristles came out immediately and continued to shed. The total face brush and bronzing brush is very rough on my skin. I tried to use them twice and both times were completely unbearable against my face. The only decent brushes are the foundation brush, brow wand, and smudge sponge. These brushes are now just a decor items in my bathroom and I&#x27;m still on the hunt for decent brushes. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friends bday, she loves them</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of them but I have used most of them. The ones I have used I really like :-)</li>
    <li> Not great..but very affordable. .the blush brush feels like its scratching my face. My advice..pay a little more and fet better quality brushes.</li>
    <li> like the pic, come in individual packages but i love it</li>
    <li> Good deal nice brushes</li>
    <li> Shipping was great no delays. I love my brushes they came individually packaged and the type of brushes are noted so you can know which brush goes where. Great for a beginner like myself. I would recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my daughter and she just thinks they are the best...not bad for a teenager....and the price was inexpensive that if it breaks or gets lost its not like losing a million bucks.  When the daughter gets a job and earns her own money then she can get the better brushes but for right now they are doable!  Package arrived quickly and in great condition!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush set. I love the eye brushes and the angled contour/blush brush. The concealer brush is horrible though, seriously. I dunno if i got a deformed one or something, but it was seriously like an eighth of an inch long. But if ur looking for some good face and eye brushes then i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes! I love them. I wash them and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out. They&#x27;re soft and they offer all the different types of brushes you would need to apply any makeup.</li>
    <li> The quality is not acceptable.  The brushes are stiff to the point that it scratches your face.  The bristles call out all over your face from its shedding.  The only decent ones are the eyebrow brush and the eyeliner one that I can use at a lip liner in a pinch.  I threw them out!  They cannot be used.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes with one exception. The large brushes are not soft and they are shedding. The smaller brushes are soft and I really like them. I am considering buying new brushes to replace the large brushes.</li>
    <li> Another great deal on Amazon. Love the set!</li>
    <li> My daughter was very happy on Xmas morning</li>
    <li> Perfect at set of brushes!  I&#x27;m a beginner so this set started me off well :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are ok. I&#x27;m not happy with the kabuki face brush because it&#x27;s not plush enough,  also the concealer brush is way too small.  I actually use the foundation brush as a concealer brush and it works great. Overall decent purchase</li>
    <li> Go and buy another brand. Poor quality</li>
    <li> Can be kind of itchy. Otherwise they are great brushes!</li>
    <li> Eh alright some broke off when opened them</li>
    <li> good quality and nice price! I bought another set for my friend.</li>
    <li> Brush was good for the price</li>
    <li> I love the price of this set because there are many 12 piece brush sets that cost $50 and up. Some of the brushes are really helpful and are great in my makeup routine. However, some of my brushes began to fall apart within the SECOND DAY of having them and have become unusable or I&#x27;ve had to glue them back together. Not cool. I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES WERE AMAZING!!!!!!!! Theyre all super soft, and come packaged individually. ive had these about a month and I jjust love them, no shedding so far. The names of the brush are on them that way I actually know what Im doing haha. great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping and great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> I love elf products and their great prices. These brushes are great. They do not shed and there is everything in need in this kit.</li>
    <li> I got this set because I had to start somewhere, :) But after first use, the foundation brush started to disintegrated. And after one cleaning, (with brush cleaner), the brush started to fall apart, and other hair brushes because very stiff. It&#x27;s pretty bad that it itches my skin. While it is amazing value, I had started to replace most of the brushes pretty soon after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these brushes one by one at my local dollar store. Whenever I go in there I check and usually they have a new one so i pick it up. They are great brushes for the price I have 6 of them and I wish I would have saw this set sooner so I could have purchased it. (Which I&#x27;m still going to do when i my birthday rolls around)  but they are great brushes for the price, soft, smooth great application.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used all my brushes because am not really a make up finatic but the ones I used works really well.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter and at first she was excited.  As soon as she started using them they all fell apart.  Not enough glue and the bristles fell out and heads came off.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have yet to use them, but the brushes came neatly packed, all of them were in their own little pouches with the description, also all the brushes were soft with use engraved on them, none were broken. So far I love it, I&#x27;m just waiting to use them to give it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> The brushes with brown bristles shed very easy and the hairs from the brush get all over my face but the other ones are Grate</li>
    <li> For the cost you really can&#x27;t beat this deal, as a make up artist with clients that can&#x27;t afford &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34;, I recommend anything this company has produced. Very pleased with these brushes</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price. I have frequented a few per my routine and like them, but they are definitely not superior quality. A bit more coarse than what i like, but apply well</li>
    <li> so many brushes so little time.....quality brushes for a great price. One brush at Sephora will cost you $38.00...don&#x27;t be a fool, buy these brushes, you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> Individual packaged but comes as a whole. Love how it list the purpose of each brush , great gift for an busy mom as I ordered for mines. Now she can stop using one brush for everything. Lol</li>
    <li> Perfect, I like the condition of these and the quality, was a great buy</li>
    <li> not cheesy and cheep ... there really a good quality brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal! The brushes all come in their original packaging and even have descriptions on how to use them. I&#x27;m so glad i bought these</li>
    <li> This is an okay product, however, if you&#x27;re just starting out, this would actually be a good product and product line to begin your make-up brush collection with.  Some of the brushes are better than others, the big face brush I don&#x27;t care for.  It sheds and you&#x27;ve got a reddish hair(s) all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;Again, not the best but certainly not the worst.</li>
    <li> Brushes are affordable but do not feel cheap when using them. I replace my brushes about every other year or so and this was my replacement set and I LOVE them! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Received exactly on time, brushes are easy to haldle..my favourites are foundation and eye sponge brush rest all are wonderful..</li>
    <li> Brush for every need! Great choice.</li>
    <li> Love using this product</li>
    <li> They work perfectly. I received just as the description said.</li>
    <li> They were not as good quality as I had expected, but a $10 purchase and it does the job! I am satisfied!(:</li>
    <li> Nice variety set. Soft enough bristles that they don&#x27;t feel cheap. Seem sturdy (no wobble where the metal band is attached).</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them</li>
    <li> I love E.L.F. brushes! I had Sephora brushes before these and I took a chance on these to save some money. I love them more than the old brushes! They aren&#x27;t rough and they do everything that they are supposed to do. This will be my go to brand for brushes from now on.</li>
    <li> OMG. i didn&#x27;t expect these brushes come up in that much quality,and also amazed by the foundation brush!&lt;br /&gt;so so freaking good for that price!!!</li>
    <li> I love them. Not sure why others are griping about&lt;br /&gt;the quality. I got mine Friday and have used them often since then as I am a makeup artist. The blending power is there and very soft after using them repeatedly. I see myself ordering these again and I so recommend them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are cheaply made and sold at a cheap price. The tops fall off and they are pretty rough. It actually kind of hurt to put on blush. They aren&#x27;t particularly HORRIBLE brushes but they sure aren&#x27;t good. I would only recommend them if you only have $12 to your name and for some reason want to buy make up brushes.</li>
    <li> Todo Bien! Excelente precio. LLego a tiempo, lo recomiendo altamente buena calidad y responsabilidad.&lt;br /&gt;Muy Buen articulo verificado ok &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Its ok. For the price its good. I like the colors they could be a little softer but they fell apart sooner than i anticipated.</li>
    <li> Love my brushes, My first order of good brushes, just getting into make and im so happy i brought these</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price. Comes in individual packaging so thats probably why there is a plastic smell but just air out and the smell should come off on its own.</li>
    <li> Loveeeee! There&#x27;s so many brushes and they work fabulously</li>
    <li> This brush set from e.l.f. is perfect for beginners or people who don&#x27;t tend to use makeup as much. This set gives you a good array of brushes with the name on the brushes. The cases they came in were confusing for me to open at first but that&#x27;s probably a personal problem. This product has a synthetic feel and the big total face brush has a very hard texture. The shedding is pretty minimal so don&#x27;t worry about it too much. The smaller brushes are good and sturdy for smooth application.</li>
    <li> Brushes are good for the price. Some of mine have separated, but a little super glue puts them back to new. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The fibers on the brushes started falling out right away.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> REALLY GREAT PRODUCTS FOR SUPER PRICE</li>
    <li> It was a gift, she seemed excited.</li>
    <li> love my brushes they are great</li>
    <li> Has all the essentials you need. Considering the price, the brushes are of better quality than I expected. I barely had to wait since I have prime. I was a pretty devout Bare Escentuals customer til now, but I will definitely be trying out more ELF products in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my best friend and she totally loves them. They are her favorite and she wishes she had a set back when we were in high school, lol.</li>
    <li> These brushes aint no good. After using them I washed them n they were all a mess smh</li>
    <li> After using these my wife became so attractive I accused myself of cheating on her.</li>
    <li> Arrived just as it said. Love the brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are ok for the price. some of the brushes shedded like crazy. the professional product line is of better quality.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used E.L.F. products prior to ordering but had heard about it on youtube. I&#x27;ve been using my brushes about a year and a half, and they&#x27;re still in great condition. They seem to be natural and synthetic fibers. After adding a couple Bare Minerals brushes to the mix, I have everything I need. The only one I&#x27;m not in love with is the tiny concealer brush. I do use it to conceal blemishes on occaison but usually need to use the flat foundation one to blend.</li>
    <li> Great makeup brushes for the price</li>
    <li> These brushes are worth buying. Definatly love them!</li>
    <li> Always good quality for a great price. Love E.L.F. I always buy this brand and I am never ever dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I use almost all of them when I makeup myself, each one of them is so usefull, specially the small ones for my eyes and eyebrows. I recommend them!</li>
    <li> 12 Brushes for 12 Dollars.. this was a steal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought this for my girlfriend just so she would have extra brushes and she loves them!</li>
    <li> I got these and I love them! They are great brushes for the price!! And the brush hair doesn&#x27;t fall out everywhere after you clean them like some other cheap ones</li>
    <li> the brushes are well priced for their quality. they dont shed like other higher end brushes. each brush comes with its own case and they are all well labeled i would recommend to family and friends</li>
    <li> The brushes are too rough, not soft at all. The face brushes scratch and make your face itch, and it doesn&#x27;t evenly carry the product, making it powdery. Soft brushes feel great on the skin and carry a good amount of product, unlike these. The only two brushes that I am pleased with and use are the liner brush and the eyebrow and eyelash comb. I also use the concealer brush as a highlighter for the corner of my eyes. Otherwise I would not reccomend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price, but after several months of use the metal parts start to come off the wooden stick.</li>
    <li> Worth the price, not great quality</li>
    <li> Definitely a good value for what you get. A dollar a brush is very, VERY inexpensive in the world of makeup brushes (considering high-end brushes can go for $22 a piece) but considering the ridiculously low price they are actually decent quality! I bought these for a friend of mine who is just starting to learn how to apply makeup... I gave these to her in conjunction w/ an ELF makeup kit that has application instructions. This is a great beginner&#x27;s kit because each brush is labeled so the user will know exactly how to utilize each brush. Would have been nice to have some sort of kit to put the brushes in, but for the money how much can I ask for? Overall, I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> The brushes work great but they do shed a bit at first. Once you use them regularly they don&#x27;t shed as much or at all anymore for that matter.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes!</li>
    <li> The large brushes shed and are not soft at all.The smaller ones are decent, but still would definitely NOT recommend!</li>
    <li> Really bad dont recommend this..</li>
    <li> These are great -- the bristles don&#x27;t fall out, they seem to be decent quality, and there is one of everything -- so useful!</li>
    <li> Pls do not buy. The brushes keep shedding when using</li>
    <li> This package comes with tons of brushes for everything you&#x27;d ever need and so cheap! They aren&#x27;t the most amazing quality, but they&#x27;re nice, and my MIL loved them.</li>
    <li> Got to hand it to E.l.f. !!  The price of these brushes are fantastic! The quality is amazing and I plan on using them again and again...I even want to order another set as a backup! The best ones in the bunch are the fluffy powder brushes and the foundation brush as well as the shadow brushes....Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This product came nicely packaged in individual bags. All the brushes were new and in new condition. Plus, I only paid $12 for it. Now the down side is that the company ELF charges the same price; thus, you can get the brushes from here or ELF it self.</li>
    <li> The largest brush wasn&#x27;t as soft as I had hoped, but for a dollar each, these brushes are good quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for what I got!  There are about 2-3 brushes that feel like they won&#x27;t be lasting for too long.  The &amp;#34;All Over Face&amp;#34; brush is rough so I don&#x27;t use that one.  Still awesome product for price!</li>
    <li> I have been very satisfied with this product. I&#x27;m really a novice when it comes to makeup, but I have been trying to improve and having a pack of these that I acquired at a very reasonable price helps. They are each individually packaged with no pouch or any means of keeping them together, but I already had a makeup case to use with them. My mother was jealous when she saw them, so I bought a second set for her for Christmas!</li>
    <li> There are a few brushes that are a total wasted of money. For example, the total face brush, the brush/bronzer brush are the worse. The rest its OK. Nothing to be amaze.</li>
    <li> im in love these are some very strong long lasting and just everything you need for your make up needs and the prices just cant be beat</li>
    <li> The eye shadow brushes in this kit are fantastic! The shadow brushes all do what they are intended to do perfectly and are very soft. The face brushes on the other hand are awful. The foundation brush leaves streaks and separates while trying to apply foundation without applying a lot of pressure. The powder brush is very scratchy, and feels like I am brushing a Brillo pad over my face.The eyeshadow brushes are worth the full price, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on using anything else from this package.</li>
    <li> and again... I don&#x27;t know why I need so much of these tools, when I mostly even have no time for make-up!! But I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and the brushes are really very soft! and of good shapes and sizes!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Best part is they come in their own case, was worried about storing them in my make-up box. They feel nice and look good. Can&#x27;t wait to really test them out.</li>
    <li> All of the brushes came in clear individual pouches which is aweomse but when I first washed them out they were bleeding red as if they had already been used before, it was quite offputting.</li>
    <li> Everything was as pictured and arrived on time. The only issue I have with this set is that the liquid foundation brush, the main reason I bought the set, is falling apart. I don&#x27;t have much use for any other brushes besides the eye shadow and face brush. Overall, it&#x27;s an alright deal, I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t fall apart so easily.</li>
    <li> Each brush came individually wrapped...which is nice because there are probably one or two that I&#x27;ll never use. Each brush is also marked for the purpose they serve...which is also nice for a makeup &amp;#34;newbie&#x27;. I only used two today but they seemed to work quite well. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality !!  They came with each one in their own slipcover, the quality is great and they work perfectly</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  I was rolling the dice as you sometime&#x27;s never know what you will get with inexpensive brush sets and this one was a score!  They brushes have very nice soft fibers (but not too soft) and are well made with little to no shedding.  My favorite is the eye shadow brush I use it all the time and I have washed it many times and it dries just fine.  The foundation brush is pretty nice too has a nice firmness to the bristles.  Each brush came in it&#x27;s own reusable case that was nice also.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set if you are not in the market to pay a lot of money for brushes.</li>
    <li> I have used brushes from Sephora that cost about 10x these. These are great quality for the price. I wash mine frequently so if they break down eventually it won&#x27;t be hard to buy a new set at such a great price. Great selection of various brush styles too!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These brushes have a horrible smell. I washed them several times and some of the brushes still smell. They also fall apart.</li>
    <li> I use these to travel with instead of my expensive set. Works great. Bristles fall off lot but for the price...IT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are smooth especially the face brush, had a little falling out but after I washed them it was good,they came individually packed</li>
    <li> I love ELF brushes and frequently buy them at TARGET for around $3 a brush.  This set is great because it offers many brushes that are not available in retail stores.  You also are paying a lot less per brush.  They were delivered quickly and seem to be of good quality.  The large powder brush does shed, but I think that will subside the more I use them.</li>
    <li> for the price and knowing these are not top notch brushes i was extremely pleased save a few bucks not buying all the brushes independently at the store!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good cosmetic brushes at a reasonable rate, these brushes are terrific and a steal for the money</li>
    <li> perfect brush set! covers are makeup application needs!</li>
    <li> My only concern was that I wish it had the type of brush imprinted on the actual brush handle, not just on the sleeve they arrive in. I&#x27;m a beginner in makeup and I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;How am I going to remember what?&amp;#34; Hahahhaha But other than that...they are fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;I hope the white handle part doesn&#x27;t get dirty when I travel though... :/</li>
    <li> Not all the brushes do the job.</li>
    <li> This set has everything you need to do most make-up looks and is a great bargain for the amount of brushes you are getting. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with any of them shedding or breaking and I wash them everyday.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft. I bought some ECO Tools, and they were too rough and kept poking my eyelid(very uncomfortable). These are waaaay better!!!</li>
    <li> Mostly ok but some of the brushes immediately started shedding and made my skin itchy. 75% were usable and good.</li>
    <li> Great price, great brushes.  I use them every day and enjoy experimenting with the different brushes.  Arrived quick too.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> so beautiful! i buying more!</li>
    <li> The set is a full range - I don&#x27;t think there is any other brush I&#x27;d ever need but the problem is they smell really bad! I washed with them twice, let them soak in soapy water, but the smell just doesn&#x27;t go :-(</li>
    <li> SAME OF THE BRUSHES WORKS GOODS AND ANOTHERS BRUSHES HAIR WILL FALL ,SO ITS OK, I HAD NEVER TRIED THIS BRAND BUT IS OK</li>
    <li> Best quality make up brushes for the price..period</li>
    <li> nothing much to say about this product i bought it for a need and it works as expected oh well</li>
    <li> I haven;t used ALL of my brushes yet because its so many and I&#x27;m not a big make-up person but the ones that I have used are great. Cheap dn reasonable price especially if you&#x27;re not into make-up like I am.</li>
    <li> Works well with my make up and the price is a great incentive too,</li>
    <li> This is a nice inexpensive starter brush kit. It is a great gift for teens or to use as a travel brusk set.</li>
    <li> I was looking for brushes and read and watched a lot of reviews I am very happy with these brushes just make sure you wash them first.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, on time and was exactly what I expected and extremely neatly packaged and labeled. The price is amazing.</li>
    <li> some brushes were a bit harder but some were really good for the price</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product for the money. I wish I would have bought more to give as gifts. However I think it ships from China.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that each of these comes in its own little pouch. My reason is for gift-giving, but hey. It counts. The packages are nice; not dime-store junk-looking. And the brushes themselves appear to be of reasonable quality.</li>
    <li> WORKS AMAZING NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL GOOD FOR IT&#x27;S PRICE HANDS DOWN BEST BRUSHES EVER I LOVE THEM AND YOU WILL TO.</li>
    <li> I would just ignore the good reviews for this product because these brushes are the most cheap disgusting smelling things i have ever seen! I received these today and i am so dissatisfied with this product. First off they smell sooo bad like cheap toxic chemicals and washing them will not help it just makes the bristles fall out! Will never recommend this product to anyone ever.</li>
    <li> i bought these brushes because i read some of the comments about them being good for beginners and i agree so far i havent had any problems with them</li>
    <li> Girls!! better go Target - each brush 1$!! Cause in this set around 5 brushes you will no use, the biggest brush loosing &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;, so if you need specific brush get it in the local store.</li>
    <li> these are alright brushes...good for the price but make sure you condition them. and then eyeliner brush is a joke. do not buy these for that brush</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of brushes, and the price is great! They wash well, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding, either.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product, I really loved it with it&lt;br /&gt;And I received on time.</li>
    <li> My teen wanted some new brushes.  These seemed good for the money.  I was not expecting them to be as nice. I&#x27;m getting a set too.  They are labeled, which she loved, and individually wrapped.  These brushes were very good for the price.</li>
    <li> very nice assortment  very pleased</li>
    <li> The eye brushes, the foundation brush, and the spoolie are pretty good. The rest are bad. A good deal otherwise.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality product, I would recommend paying more for good quality brushes. These tend to shed and don&#x27;t apply makeup as well as I hoped</li>
    <li> What a great buy. I purchased these for $9.00 with free shipping. I have shopped around and this was a steal. Each comes in it&#x27;s on original reusable sleeve. I have always had reliable quality with e.l.f. brand.</li>
    <li> Awsome for first time users or light makeup users. See I&#x27;m not a huge &amp;#34;OMG I NEED TO LOOK LIKE KIM K. ALL THE TIME&amp;#34; kind of girl im basic makeup but u will use every brush in the set.</li>
    <li> got what I ordered and no surprises :)</li>
    <li> For the price, you get a decent selection of brushes.  The large powder brush and angled contour-blush brush are total garbage, though.  I trashed those two after a week.  They shed badly, and weren&#x27;t soft. They were also WAY less dense than I like my face brushes to be.  The paddle style foundation brush is ok if you use that style brush for application, but I prefer a stippling brush or buffing brush, so I don&#x27;t use the one in the set.  So basically, the only brushes I do use are the eyeshadow/liner brushes, and those are quite good for the money.  You get a smudger sponge tipped brush, a fluffy blender brush, a shadow application brush, dense stiff-bristle push liner brush, a spoolie, a comb/brush combo, a lipliner brush, a tiny brush that says it&#x27;s a concealer brush but I use it for my brows, and a thin small liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying this for the eye product brushes, then it&#x27;s a good buy.  They don&#x27;t shed, and do their respective jobs well.  If you&#x27;re looking for any face brushes, I&#x27;d recommend any of the real techniques brushes, or the eco-tools kabuki set.  Both are affordable and much better quality than these.</li>
    <li> the bristles of the brush is gentle on the skin. I personally love everything about it. It doesn&#x27;t shred even after I clean it.</li>
    <li> I like that they label each brush but personally I think the brushes are way too soft. Perhaps this is good for some people but Im not fond of that.  Also, the face brush is too small. I read this in some of the other reviews but I had hoped this wasnt too true. I dont know if i would buy brushes online again but for the price, i cant complain.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. The end result is that I look much better blended and put together than I did with other brushes. The concealer brush is perfect for under eye circles. Plus, they are very easy to use and the cost is fabulous.</li>
    <li> For the price of $12 I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes. Done feel really good and work great on the sun but sine if the brushes are sort of rough.. Again can&#x27;t really complain for $12 n plus I&#x27;m a beginner using these brushes so yes I would rate them a 4 (RATING A 4 ONLY FOR BEGINNERS but MAYBE A 2 FOR PEOPLE THAT&#x27;S BEEN DOING THE MAKEUP THING FOR A WHILE).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. So I&#x27;ve been having these brushes for about 5 months now and they are still okay but some of them are actually coming off of the stick. There is a silver metal piece that attaches the brushes to the wooden sticks and now they are breaking off the wooden sticks.</li>
    <li> especially for the price.  Bought these for my teenage daughter who loses things and travels with her make-up everywhere.  Obviously I wasn&#x27;t going to invest too much money but these are a lot nicer than I expected.  They didn&#x27;t fall apart on us or shed bristles as other reviewers have stated.  And they are incredibly soft.  Of course they smell like their plastic packaging, that dissipates over time.  They do a great job achieving exactly the result she wants.</li>
    <li> This is such great value for money! All the brushes are pretty good quality and there&#x27;s so many! I don&#x27;t use all of them, but the ones I use work well! I especially like how it come with an eyebrow and eyelash brush!</li>
    <li> I was so tempted to keep this for myself when it came in the mail.  Glad I chose this set instead of The Wal-mart set.</li>
    <li> The set  has brushes that i would pay so much for individually It&#x27;s a Great product and a Great buy!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes for my 13-year old daughter as she explores the new world of cosmetics. The brushes are decently made. Obviously not high-quality, but perfectly acceptable for occasional light use and great assortment.</li>
    <li> Had two day shipping and it was at my house within one day very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes to apply my makeup and I really like them. They apply my makeup well and they&#x27;re also really easy to clean. I just use some makeup remover, soap and cold water, gently rubbing them so that the bristles don&#x27;t fall out. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding yet on the natural bristle brushes yet. I hope they don&#x27;t since I&#x27;ve been using them the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural bristles&lt;br /&gt;- defining eye brush&lt;br /&gt;- blending eye brush&lt;br /&gt;- eyeshadow brush&lt;br /&gt;- bronzing brush&lt;br /&gt;- lip defining brush&lt;br /&gt;- total face brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synthetic bristles&lt;br /&gt;- concealer brush&lt;br /&gt;- foundation brush&lt;br /&gt;- eyeliner brush&lt;br /&gt;- eyelash &amp; brow wand&lt;br /&gt;- brow comb and brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and a smudge eye sponge</li>
    <li> All of the handles have fallen off of the metal pieces for the brush. Luckily my husband has super glue or they would go into the trash. For being E.L.F. brand brushes they sure don&#x27;t have very good quality.</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes in the mail and have to say, I love them! They aren&#x27;t the high end department store ones but they work just fine and don&#x27;t shed!! I really wanted to buy the Sigma brushes but just couldn&#x27;t stand forking out that kind of money so I thought I would give these a shot based on the reviews and the price...very glad I did!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about makeup brushes or what their use is, but these great little brushes have their name right on them and a description of their purpose on an insert in the plastic sleeve. Perfect for someone just getting into experimenting with makeup or the seasoned professional!</li>
    <li> these brushes work great! and only $1 each(: this is great for any new make up artist who need cheap brushes to start working</li>
    <li> The set is so so good, the brushes are soft but keep the shape well at the same time, it so easy to do a make up with them, espessialy to use eye shadows and liner. It gives you opportunity to apply them almost or professionaly. I highly recommend this set for everybody who is looking for the cosmetics brush set.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes they arrived on time! They are so good and the all came in the own little Packages&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
    <li> I love this set of makeup brushes. It gives a wide variety of brushes and they don&#x27;t shed. High quality even for the low price.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s fine just the big one its not soft the other are fine. And i  like it, but definitely i won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Great deal for so many brushes! I decided to buy them online because not all of these brushes are available in stores! I love them!</li>
    <li> Daughter&#x27;s were pleased to receive them, although late for xmas stocking stuffers. Although, one of my daughter&#x27;s is a make-up guru and she likes to get her brushes specific to her needs and she says this brand of brushed hair falls out to fast. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Very nice inexpensive brush set.  They work very well and are great for a beginner or just someone like me who doesn&#x27;t like spending a fortune on makeup products that I just wash off everyday! :)</li>
    <li> Best deal you can find for these brushes! I love them all!</li>
    <li> These are cheap but most of the brushes shed too much! I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again but they did come in good packaging</li>
    <li> These tend to loose hairs while you&#x27;re using them. But if you are looking for a very affordable brush set that is great for beginners this will be great for you.</li>
    <li> I had to trim almost all of them due to unevenness and there&#x27;s a good amount of shedding going on, but it&#x27;s a decent set for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I was a little skeptical because of the price (cheap), even though I heard E.l.f. brushes were good. I really do like these brushes and I haven’t experienced a lot of shedding, which is good. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had been hearing for a few years. Elf brushes a good and pretty cheep.  I ordered this pack.  They were delivered quickly.  However.  I&#x27;m not impressed.  It was pretty cheep so I&#x27;m not returning.  But I feel like I could of picked up a brush or two else&#x27;s where and been happy instead of having a bunch of brushes that are not all that great.</li>
    <li> Great set for the money! better quality for the price then at walmart or target at a fraction of the cost. you typically pay around 4 to 6 $ a brush so the set is an amazing deal</li>
    <li> All of these brushes are reasonably soft and high density, other than the big face powder one. It&#x27;s too sparse and floppy to do much other than dust off excess powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price, really. Just be sure you&#x27;re not paying more than ELF sells it for themselves!</li>
    <li> A big set of brushes for a very small amount. There is a brush for everything and it comes out to be almost a dollar per brush which is a deal you won&#x27;t find anywhere else! Highly recommend for everyone even if you only wear light makeup.</li>
    <li> LOVE them. Cheap for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> This set is great, includes lots of types of brushes and there is the identification of each and the way to use them (awesome for people like me who don&#x27;t know much about brushes)</li>
    <li> Práctic, soft, nice looking, perfect if ur introducing ur self to make up brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> Good quality! I&#x27;ve always trusted elf as one of the only inexpensive yet quality products across the board. I&#x27;d trust no one else with the little bit of cash I have as a student for make-up. Thank you!</li>
    <li> OK brushes... I wish it came with an angled brush.  The powder brush and bronzer brush are not very good-- very loose, not enough fibers.  For the price though, I&#x27;m OK with that.</li>
    <li> All the brushes are amazing quality but the largest brush is not soft and pokey. But all the other brushes are AWESOME!</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty great. I am not a makeup expert at all but I do have some M.A.C. brushes and feel like these are just the same as them.</li>
    <li> Bristles are really low quality - even with the low price, I would at least expect the brushes to not fall apart. The brushes itch and irritate my skin and the tops come apart from the handle.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with some of the brushes. They seem rough and the bristles fall out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush set because it was time for some new ones, and they were only twelve dollars. When they arrived, they came in individually wrapped plastic, with a clear description on the back.  When I opened all twelve of them, I was surprised. The were more than I had expected. So smooth, each brush gives its name on the end part. I absolutely  LOVE this brushes and use them every day. I highly recommend them!! :)</li>
    <li> This is a good deal! However I ended up returning it cause the quality is not that great. But if you are just a beginner on doing make up. Then this will be great if your just practicing. But if you have tried high end brands. Then this might just frustrate you.</li>
    <li> theres only a couple brushes that you can really use that dont tear up your face and i dont even have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very good and especially for the price. The makeup goes on smoothly and evenly. They are very easy to clean however they take awhile to dry. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, all came individually wrapped.  Definitely a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> The brushes were brand new &amp; packaged nicely. However, I did not like the brushes themselves. Could have been better.</li>
    <li> these brushes are simply great, the package was effective and lovely&lt;br /&gt;i am enjoying my makeup days now. thank you.</li>
    <li> Not so thrilled about the makeup brush, keep getting pricked with bristles and it&#x27;s not tapered evenly other than that the rest of makeup brushes I love!! thank you!</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes, they come individually packed and they are beautiful, perfect brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazingly well made and incredibly cheap!  They&#x27;d have to fall apart in minutes to be a ripoff, and if they last, they are the best buy on the planet.</li>
    <li> They are so soft and work really, really well! Also, each brush is individually labeled. I love these brushes, I highly recommended these to anyone. High quality for a low price, what do you have to lose?!</li>
    <li> As many reviewers have said, this a great way to get into makeup if you&#x27;re a beginner. It has the brushes labeled and the brushes are of great quality. I bought this a year ago to wear for my first college formal. It applies the makeup well and helped me follow online tutorials when I was applying makeup. A year later the brushes are still holding up.</li>
    <li> I already own 4 of these brushes, so I knew I already loved them.  This 12 brush set ($1 each) was a gift for my sister, and she loves them!! :)</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a gift but ended up keeping them. The metal part connected to the wood came off almost immediately. Only had these for 3 months before i tossed them all. the bristols are not soft at all and when you think the brush is clean it really isnt. Ive seen how to clean brushes and the minute you clean these they start falling out like hair and not to mention when you use them they come off on your face so you are constantly pealing them off. I guess you do get what you pay for with these.Never again, such a horrible product, i feel like these belong at the dollar store</li>
    <li> The powder and bronzer brush are not the best out there, they are very abrasive to the skin. I feel the quality could be improved. But as for the rest of the brushes..they alright. Although the fine liner brush is pretty useless and does not accomplish what it is meant for.</li>
    <li> I have once again learned my lesson when it comes to buying cheap brushes. I have recently started getting into eye makeup since watching a lot of YouTube videos &amp; wanted to spice up my look. I have bought Sephora brush sets &amp; separate brushes from them &amp; I have found them to be really functional &amp; they do the job just right. With the Sephora brushes, you don&#x27;t have worry about them getting worn out after washing them. I also have Real Techniques which are great. I have bought these E.L.F. brushes because I saw a few of beauty gurus suggest these brushes if you&#x27;re on a budget. BIG MISTAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I bought them I washed them with my brush cleaner &amp; the total face brush is completely useless now. When I let it air dry, there was a huge knot in it, which NEVER happens to me. I tried working with it to see if the brush hairs would be good for powder. This completely wasted a huge amount of my powder for no reason. Probably because of the type of hair. It feels like goat&#x27;s hair which I&#x27;ve had from uSpicy brushes. So it&#x27;s so coarse on your face, it just doesn&#x27;t feel good.&lt;br /&gt;The blending brush is not really a blending brush. It wasn&#x27;t as fluffy as I anticipated. It&#x27;s more in a dome shape. I have tried using it to blend, but it&#x27;s not really working out for me, so I just use it to put eyeshadow on the outer v of my eye.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush is great! It&#x27;s a little bit on the smaller side for me, but it definitely does it&#x27;s job &amp; it&#x27;s not harsh on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The concealer brush is good. It&#x27;s once again on the smaller side, I prefer concealer brushes that are a little bit bigger because it saves me time. This is good if I have 2 hours to get ready. But I take 30 minutes to do my foundation, powder, blush, bronzer/contour, highlighter, &amp; eyeshadow. Once again, I&#x27;m still a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;The blush/bronzer brush is coarse again, but it does it&#x27;s job. I have multiple brush sets because I do get lazy with cleaning them every single day, so this would bethe last blush/bronzer brush I would go to if my other angled brushes are dirty.&lt;br /&gt;The smudge sponge brush is completely useless. I haven&#x27;t seen any makeup artist use this. So don&#x27;t even consider this a brush because I tried smudging with this brush &amp; you&#x27;re better off using something else.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner brush is great. This is so precise for eyeliner &amp; getting eyeshadow on your bottom lash line. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The defining eye brush is decent. It does it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s not as good as my other brushes, but it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;The brow wand is whatever. It&#x27;s a good throw away for companies to include in their set.&lt;br /&gt;The lip defining brush is once again decent. I can deal without it, but it would be my second to last choice for lip brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow brush is a 3 out of 10. It doesn&#x27;t pick up eyeshadows as much as I thought it would. But I am determined to find the right eyeshadow brand to work with this. I have tried Nars &amp; the Sephora make up brand with this &amp; it just doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I am new at doing my makeup and absolutely love these brushes. I highly recommend these brushes to anyone, they are the best.</li>
    <li> I would recommend not to buy this brush.. spend a little more and get a good one.. the brushes look good but there are not soft .. hurts your skin..</li>
    <li> these brushes are my best friends. seriously they have done their job for over a year now. sure their cheap but totally worth the buy.</li>
    <li> excellent for the price! The brushes are very good quality.  I really only needed some blush brushes but it was such a great price for the set I got them.  now i am using several of them.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes! There really are as many brushes as in the picture. They are nice quality brushes, too!</li>
    <li> Great selection, pretty good price. I don&#x27;t love the foundation brush but it might be because I&#x27;m used to using a sponge so the bristles feel scratchy. The powder brush as well feels a little rough. But I really like all of the eyeliner, eyeshadow, and eyebrow brushes. The smudge stick is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Returned as all came loose and not in any sort of case.</li>
    <li> There are a couple of brushes that I don&#x27;t really use, but this is a great set for twice the price.</li>
    <li> They came so quick., are so useful. They are everything I need and more. I would deffinalty recommend this to a friend. TOTALY with it (:</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty much worth what you pay for them. When you receive them they smell like plastic so you have to wash them. Once the brushes are washed they shed tremendously but that&#x27;s expected. The blending brush I received was half the size it was supposed to be; it&#x27;s like someone cut it in half before they shipped it to me and I only noticed that the brush wasn&#x27;t supposed to be like that until I went to look for another blending brush! I even wrote into ELF Cosmetics and they acted like there was nothing they could do! Will not purchase again! These brushes are good for those starting out in makeup....definitely not for doing others makeup only your own. Would definitely not recommend because of the damaged product I received and no replacement offered. The only brush from this set I like is the smudge brush because it has nothing to shed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for years and have nothing bad to say about them. They work very well and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with losing bristles or anything. This set is really great and has a nice variety of every day and special occasion brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are not the highest quality brushes, but for as many as you get, it&#x27;s a great buy!!  I use many of them everyday, and I am glad that I bought them.  Medium quality, low price!</li>
    <li> Great product for cheap</li>
    <li> a lot of product for the money!! thanks</li>
    <li> Great buy! I use these daily. I&#x27;ve had them about 6 months now and they are still going strong!</li>
    <li> Great make up kit that I sent to my sister in law as a gift. Comes with a good amount of items needed to do makeup at home for most women.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. Products looks great to me.</li>
    <li> Each back comes in it&#x27;s own plastic bag.  Nice quality.  Had to buy a brush carrier separate, but it made a nice gift.</li>
    <li> The brushes work okay. I don&#x27;t really use any of them except for the foundation brush. I like that it was affordable but I don&#x27;t use more than half the brushes because they&#x27;re not that great. ECO-TOOLS has an absolutely amazing blush brush as well as angled brush. The bristles are really soft and not irritating at all. They also do not shed. I prefer eco-tools over this. They&#x27;re a little more expensive but still very affordable.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, price is fantastic and quality is very good. The kids get into my brushes all the time and they play rough, these have lasted a couple rounds of &amp;#34;let&#x27;s do mommy&#x27;s make up!&amp;#34;  without any breakage. Even though I don&#x27;t wear make up regularly, these work great the couple times I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
    <li> These are great for bridesmaids gifts. I&#x27;m using a glass jar (with a lid) colored beads and makeup brushes. They are PERFECT! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They aren&#x27;t the best but they get the job done.I think they will last me a while</li>
    <li> That saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for!&amp;#34; well in this case its very true. I purchased these back in August 2013, I am not a makeup artist but I do apply make up every day so these brushes are used every day. I got them home and like others have said they did have a really bad smell to them and after washing it did intensify the smell but after a few uses the smell was gone. With that said overall I do like them and they do work and I would say get them if you need brushes and have to stick to a budget. The big face brush head has come apart from the handle and i&#x27;ve had to glue it back together, it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape very well at all. after about two weeks of use it looks like a fan brush. Its not very soft and is a little scratch on your face. However the eye brushes are great. If anything I would avoid the face brushes (blush, foundation powder) and just get the eye brushes. I also wanted to mention that I do use the conceler brush as an eyeliner brush with my gel eyeliner and it works really well - the lip brushes I have used at eye brushes as well not for their intended purpose but I do like them and think they are worth the $1.00 they are asking for them. I really hope this has helped in deciding on this product. As a side note if you just want to buy a few of these brushes they do sell them at Christmas Tree Shops (CTS) for $1.00 and you avoid shipping charges and get only what you want. My favorite is the fluffy eye blending brush - I did pick up another at CTS the last time i was there.</li>
    <li> At roughy $1 a brush I am in love with this brush set. The bristles do not fall out like you would probably expect them too and they are super easy to clean. I clean my brushes once a week or once every 2 weeks using a little blue dawn dish soap and they remain in tact, hold their shape, and do not fall apart. Better than a lot of the overpriced makeup brush sets on the market!</li>
    <li> They arrived on time. Each brush has what their used for! I love elf products</li>
    <li> I got this package in a timely matter. It was packaged appropiately. I am happy with my purchase because I am not a professional by any means so I love the fact that each brush came with a description of what it is used for. Even more than that I love the fact the names of the brushes are on the side so I know what the brush is. The price of the brushes boils down to a dollar a brush. I am not an expert but for a dollar a brush I am estastic. My brushes are not shedding and I have already washed them twice. If you are a professional who knows what really high class brushes are suppsed to lookand feel like... you might have a different opinion but if you are a beginner this is a great way to start and will get the job done. I will post an update if anything happens.</li>
    <li> Foundation brush tip fell off at first use. Brushes are oversized overall so aren&#x27;t very precise. Overall, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> they serve their purpose and work well. an elf brush that I purchased in a store a few years back as a tendency to have he brush/metal part come off of the stick but it easily goes back together, I haven&#x27;t had that problem with these yet.</li>
    <li> These are the worst makeup brushes that I have EVER owned.  That&#x27;s saying something, since every other makeup brush that I have owned, I have gotten as a free gift.  The eyeshadow brushes were very obviously used - there was eyeshadow still on the brushes.  The bristles were falling off in chunks on several of the brushes.  The bristles on the brushes that should have been even, were not even close to being even.  I am very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes~!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! This product is amazing! So i bought these as a gift for a friend and she loves them. Each brush comes individually packaged, plus there is a little description of what each brush is to be used for , which is very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are sturdy and strong. I cant say if these brushes shed, however my friend did mention to me that it has not started shedding AS YET. These were purchased in July, so that means they are three months old and going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please purchased as they are worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Came with so many brushes looks so professional and everything was individually packed</li>
    <li> Wonderful collection.</li>
    <li> Obviously it is just a cheap brush kit. I use the spooly and blender brushes, the rest just kind of sit there in case of an emergency.</li>
    <li> Beautipedia gave this set a &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; rating (darn them!).  Meh. Most are fine, but the larger brushes - powder, blush - are harsh and cheap. Well, I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I bought e.l.f. brushes because I didn&#x27;t think it made sense to buy expensive, high end brushes. I mean, they&#x27;re just brushes, right? I was wrong, these are just terrible. I have had to throw away makeup because the brushes shed so much in it. Not to mention the amount of hair I&#x27;m forced to pick off of my face after using these brushes. They&#x27;re awful; 0/10; do not recommend.</li>
    <li> They were very good at first but the glue that holds the top to the bottom part is obviously cheap because 4 of the brushes are broke. I decided to go with another brand. They are cheap, yes, so it is expected that they wouldn&#x27;t be as good as a more expensive brand, but they could atleast stay together</li>
    <li> I love my brushes! They are great. I have very little fall out of any bristles/hairs.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to getting this set as it contained everything I needed but after two uses of the powder brush, it started scratching my skin.  I even tried soaking it and air drying it.  It is stiff, scratchy and almost tacky to the touch.  Very disappointed.  I have thrown it away.  The blush brush is not much better.  Be careful with this set.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes roughly about 2 weeks ago, and all I can say is...... I love them!! Great color pick up and good blending capability. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that, they had a funny plastic smell but that was expected being that they were shipped in plastic. Great brushes overall!</li>
    <li> Very good brush set I&#x27;m so happy I got it. It has everything I need and more done be afraid get it. It&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I thought this was a set. They are all packaged individually and shipped in one plastic bag. Kinda ruined my plans of giving as a gift.. They are only for my 12 year old so not a real big deal though.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the prices on E.l.f. products! They obviously aren&#x27;t going to be the same quality as the more expensive stuff, but you could just replace the brushes multiple times before you would ever even come close to the cost of other brushes!</li>
    <li> I have all the tools I need. Great price, quality brushes, since I usually do my makeup in the car I only use a few but at home the others come in handy.</li>
    <li> Ever since I tried ELF product I swear by them, I always am satisfied with them. The brushed don&#x27;t shed, and are easy to clean, they last a while and they are the best priced brushed I&#x27;ve ever seen with great value.</li>
    <li> I totally love these!!! They are so soft and are perfect for light make up! I will buy these again if ever I need brushes for myself or as a gift! And the price is good too!</li>
    <li> I mean I got what I paid for. The brushes do their job. However, the foundation brush always leaves bristles on my face.</li>
    <li> perfect brushes. love them</li>
    <li> I checked the e.l.f website for these, and they were nothing like this! The ones on the website had a black stick, and they were $45 for 11 brushes! But I did end up getting theses anyway and I was pleased with the quality for 1 dollar each! I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> They were all decent quality brushes. The 2 that shed or not soft is the all over face brush and the bronzing brush. The more i wash the brushes, the softer they get which i thought was strange. They come with basically every brush thqt you need if you are a beginner to makeup. Overall, they are not fancy expensive brushes but they get the job done and i would reccomend these brushes to people who are newer to makeup.</li>
    <li> Wow when I ordered this I had no idea how many great brushes were included for the money. These brushes are soft &amp; come in every size &amp; do not smell chemically treated. I will tell all my girlfriends about these because every woman wants to look flawless. They have bronzer brush, foundation brush, concealer brush, eyeshadow brush, lip liner brush, &amp; many more. I recommend it if you are a Make- UP junkie like me.</li>
    <li> I got these on sale for 5$ @walgreens. I expected something different. I thought they were going to be softer. (like the ones made out of animal furr) but they were not. They feel like the ones they have at the dollar tree. Kinda ruff and have to go over the area over and over to get it to blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like to buy products that test on animals or kill animals just so we can \\&quot;look good\\&quot;. But i know some company has to somehow imitate the brushes im looking for, but without all the killing.</li>
    <li> I never really had any &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; of make up brushes till now and I absolutely love them! They are so nice and are perfect for their jobs. The only thing is I wish it came with a case. But I LOVE the brushes! I absolutely recommend them.</li>
    <li> The reason why this set of brushes is only getting a 3 star from me is because of quality.  As usual my Prime package containing this was on time, love the service however the brushes them selves are sub par.  I usually use Urban Decay brushes but I was looking for something cheaper.  Well, as the saying goes - you get what you pay for.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t used the foundation brush or else I would&#x27;ve returned these. If anything, buy this for the eye shadow brushes but don&#x27;t expect the larger ones to actually hold any powder.  If you&#x27;re looking for overall powder face brushes and foundation brushes - buy something else, they might cost more but they won&#x27;t be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for myself and one for my teen-aged daughter and we both love them.  We&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of months and are happy with the quality.  They are soft and none of the bristles are shedding.  So far I haven&#x27;t seen a downside and of course the price was great!  Highly recommend:)</li>
    <li> I bought the set for three of the brushes. I have high end brush and cheap ones. Elf is a cheap company but it is a good quality. Better than my Mac brushes no. Better than my Sephora brushes no better than my Eco friendly brushes yes. Better than my rite aid brushes yes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush set! All brushes are individually packaged and beautiful!! I checked them all for loose hairs and very few fell out!!  Love applying my makeup with them, they pick up just as much as I need with no excess!  Cannot say enough about them!  I was also super excited about the fast shipping!! All around happy!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are easy to use and so soft! They come with instructions if you are not used to using brushes. Great starter kit!</li>
    <li> Knowing how much these brushes cost I expected them to be lower quality, but they are junk. Pretty much falling apart. The bronze brush literally fell apart when I used it. The bristles fell out of the metal casing. The eye brushes are very rough and even after washing smell terrible. I just ended up throwing them all away. Sad.</li>
    <li> Bought a set for my teenaged niece and ordered one for myself  after i saw how much she liked the entire set!</li>
    <li> I covered a review for this product on my blog (not for profit). Feel free to check it out. Don&#x27;t worry, it is not spam.    Live.Love.Latte. Blog  [...]</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup brushes I have ever owned. Awesome price. The quality is excellent. This kit has all the brushes you need.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes are great. Easy to apply makeup with brush application. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy. The price was a steal, the product was a complete steal based on the price. Each came individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> This set of brushes is serving me well. I have no complaints whatsoever. They&#x27;re durable, soft and get the job done every time.</li>
    <li> Best brushes; best price</li>
    <li> Love there&#x27;s brushes. So soft and don&#x27;t leave brush hair all over your face.</li>
    <li> I like E.L.F and appreciate their usually decent quality for ridiculously low price.So first i will try to point out that there are few OK brushes in this set:&lt;br /&gt;eye shadow brush;&lt;br /&gt;defining eye brush(angled);&lt;br /&gt;concealer brush;&lt;br /&gt;foundation brush;&lt;br /&gt;eye liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;The rest is junk.Bristles came out in clumps out of my blending eye brush and bronzing brush even before I washed it,after washing it got so bad I had to throw them out.Total face brush is scratchy, stinky and sheds too,so it also got junked.Brushes come off their handles just after few uses, in my opinion, this set should come with a tube of superglue.&lt;br /&gt;Few of these brushes I would be fine for a teenager or someone on a very tight budget, but purchase them separately for $1 each, not the whole set.Other brushes from E.L.F studio line are much better quality, but this set really sucks.</li>
    <li> You can purchase this at the dollar store. They are ok brushes but some of them they break easily. They are good if you&#x27;re in a budget. The black versions are way better and just 2 bucks more.  Good for teens who are just starting to use make up.</li>
    <li> so far so good but i have not tried all the brushes yet. it feels great on your face and its the right size for my make up cases.</li>
    <li> great set for the price, not too shabby</li>
    <li> These elf brushes are ok for the price, when i went to use the eyeshadow brush for the first time the metal part  part that keeps the brush on the stick came off due to lack of or crappy glue, and all the brushes seem to shed, my favorite vmcrush is the foundation brush beacause it gives my face an airbrush look which i love. But other than that the brushes are ok especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This ELF cosmetics 12 piece brush set is pretty good. I&#x27;ve had for about a month now and it&#x27;s doing great. We&#x27;re having a lot of fun together. I also purchased a set for my sister who&#x27;s in school for makeup and she loves it. I don&#x27;t have any shed complaints, but one of the brushes did come out of the handle but nothing a little gorilla glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I think this works, but, I found a 15 piece brush that was 10$ earlier this week that works better. They were cheaper and in my defence, better quality.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I recommend is that you wash the brushes before you use them. They have a weird smell to them but I think it is because of the packaging that is with the brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes were very sturdy and they don&#x27;t shed. The white color of the handles is almost like a pearl.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set with a good variety of brushes for all your needs. The quality seems good especially for the price.</li>
    <li> A good starter set for the price! Definitely much cheaper to buy this together than each piece separately. I just wish it came with a case :/</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Love them. Lots of variety too. I gave them as gifts to the girls in my family and they were thrilled.</li>
    <li> The brushes are alright great for starters and pros.It pretty great for the price your paying for it!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great product!!</li>
    <li> These are my everyday makeup brushes and I&#x27;m very happy so far.  They have endures several washes and still held up.  There are a good quality for the price.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with most elf products.</li>
    <li> Great little set! Got it for applying my Snazaroo face paint for cosplay, and these work great!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have to spend ridiculous amount on money on makeup brushes. I&#x27;m a SAHM, so I don&#x27;t need anything fancy. Just needed something to help me get the job done, and these do. I will say that the bristles on one of the brushes is a little rough. Besides the one though, the rest of the brushes are really great.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware, this price is more than twice what these are offered for from E.L.F. These are TWELVE DOLLARS, NOT THIRTY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy price hike, batman!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always made due with disposable applicators or my fingers, so it was a real treat to finally get a wide range of brushes. The foundation brush was a totally new experience and I was pleased with how quickly I was able to apply a large area. The eyeshadow brushes were good too. I want to wash the brushes and if they hold their shape well, I&#x27;ll likely amend my review to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I like it but some of the brushes is not soft enough like what i expect but theoverall view is good</li>
    <li> I like these brushes they are great for extras in your personal or professional kits.  They are  very attractive.  A great starter set</li>
    <li> E.l.f. generally has items that are mostly very good (even great) for a very, very modest price. For some women, it can be hit or miss -- but it gives you the chance to try out lots of different stuff without an investment. That said, this set of 12 brushes is a makeup lover&#x27;s dream. No, they are not made from wildly expensive components, and you shouldn&#x27;t expect them to be. However, if you are looking for a really excellent assortment of useful brushes that can last you a bit with care, this is it! Use the set, identify which ones are most useful for you, and buy only those in the future individually. These brushes are a real FIND!</li>
    <li> Like most all ELF products these brushes were quite affordable. And like mostt ELF products the brushes are really nice and perform well. Will look to purchase more from this seller again. Well packaged and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for someone who isn&#x27;t a master in cosmetics because it says on the side what it is supposed to be used for. I was looking for a set that did that and couldn&#x27;t find a reasonably priced one, so I got these, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that they did have the writing.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I&#x27;m learning how to apply my makeup and at the time I didn&#x27;t know what brush to use for what job. These are labeled, so that made that easier. I&#x27;ve been using them for about two months. I clean them after each use and have not noticed any hairs falling out of the brush. They clean nicely. Nice value for the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase, for the price this are a very good value. The brushes are great for each purpose, good description in each package.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good. I bought these brushes and they were very useful. The texture of the brushes are very good. The brushes shed just as any make up brush and they are very good quality. I am very satisfied with the purchase of these brushes, and I would surely buy them again.</li>
    <li> The total face brush and bronzing brush are awful. They are somewhat wiry, so everything I try to apply with them goes on streaky. All the other brushes are fabulous:  they are soft, apply makeup well, and I love using them. I also like that the names of the brushes are on the handles, since I&#x27;m not a makeup brush expert. But if you are purchasing this for the big fluffy brush and angled bronzing brush, don&#x27;t bother with this set, just go find another one or go to a place where you can feel the brush and test its quality before you buy it.</li>
    <li> the feather was poor, i couldn&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> I am a beginner in makeup and I would say this is a great kit to start with especially because you get so many brushes for such a cheap price</li>
    <li> It was safely deliverd on time to my door through Prime. Its 100% micro fibers which u can give them thier monthly wash and it not loose its application..</li>
    <li> i have never actually had a full set of brushes, I have always just cobbled together a set from various places. These are nice brushes and for very little money I have all my bases--er, faces?--covered. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  They shed like crazy! But they do the job.</li>
    <li> its great and all type of brushes for the makeup works perfectly</li>
    <li> Great set so far so good. I&#x27;ve never tried elf products before and I can honestly say I am impressed. It was very inexpensive and it gets the job done. The brushes haven&#x27;t shed a bit. I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that the brush itself detached from the base however, that has not happened to me. If your looking for cheap brushes with decent quality, I would say this is the route to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to learn how to apply makeup specifically eye shadows. I rarely wear foundation because I have smooth skin. Just the dark spots that I am trying to cover one day. It&#x27;s all there and one thing I noticed is few hair will fall off the brushes. Oh well, it&#x27;s not like I use them everyday anyway.</li>
    <li> The bristles are coming out of the eye shadow brush and the whole face brush. Otherwise, the other brushes seem to be okay. I would not buy this again though. Not quality.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush set. If you&#x27;re on a budget and you want something that is still going to work for you, then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying my brush set. I feel like such a pro and e.l.f has some amazing products. Definately will be purchasing more of this brand.</li>
    <li> Well, they&#x27;re ok for the most part, but some of the brushes are losing hair and leaving them on my face. NOT COOL at all. And the bristles are a bit too hard for me. I liked the foundation brush, it&#x27;s good and soft. as well as the brow brushy. the others were kind of meh.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I was able to get a complete set of brushes for a reasonable price. I got these for my beauty guru sister-in-law for Christmas. She was excited because E.L.F. Brushes are supposedly good to use. She was more than pleased to have a full-set, especially to replace some of the ones that may have expired over time.</li>
    <li> My makeup brushes got here so quickly! They were all individually packaged and ready to use! I was very please with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great price!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! It came in a very timely matter. The package was small enough to fit right in my mail box. Each brush comes in its own little package that has a cardboard slip that says what the brush can be used for. I ordered this set cause it was cheap. I gave this product 4 stars because I keep my brushes in a jar and there was a lot of waste with the individual packaging. Overall i am very pleased!</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with this set of brushes. They are excellent quality for the price. I bought the set for my daughter for Christmas and I was really impressed. Definitely recommended. I have an e.l.f. concealer brush that I have been using for the past 2 years, so I knew that one was good, but was curious about the quality of the rest of them. They really are great. They aren&#x27;t cheap feeling, like dollar tree quality, but they carry the same price. It is an amazing deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set came with each brush in it own individual packaging (just like if you would buy them separate at the store) inside a plastic bag - like a ziploc bag type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the purchase and my daughter was thrilled to have such a nice variety.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try out these makeup brushes, but was quickly disappointed. The first time I used each one, the bristles started falling out and they are so rough that it hurts your face. They do hold product well however, and are a good, cheap alternative for people just starting out with makeup because they do the job and help you learn what brushes you like to use the most.</li>
    <li> Not high quality, but they&#x27;re inexpensive, so I&#x27;m not surprised.  They&#x27;re fine for now, so I&#x27;m keeping them.  As one may guess (based on the price), the bristle quality isn&#x27;t exceptional and they&#x27;re kinda short.</li>
    <li> Just a few brushes are good, the powder and eye shadow brushes are rubbish. I certainly would not buy this again</li>
    <li> The brushes are absolutely great. They were each packaged individually and the name of the brush were posted as well.</li>
    <li> I order this brush on August 7, 2012 and received it today (August 11, 2012). It arrive before the delivery date. Is a good price, 12 brushes for 12 dollar. If anyone just starting out with make-up I recommend you  these brushes for starter. And the good thing about these brushes is each brush has their own name stamped on the handle so you&#x27;ll know what to use it on. So overall I&#x27;m really happy with purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I have used these for the past 3 days with only 1 very small issue. One of the brushes was loose at the base.... You know... Where the metal and the wood? are. A little bit of glue took care of that. The bristles are exactly how they should be as far as softness and stiffness goes. I wash my make up brushes after every use and I haven&#x27;t had any problems there either! No bristles falling out or anything! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re not crazy serious into make up. It does it&#x27;s job better than expected. Totally worth the price... Just wish it came with its own case...</li>
    <li> Love this set of brushes.  They great all around.</li>
    <li> Half the brushes are pretty good and the other half not so much. Not too bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, these brushes are good quality.  The first time I acquired an E.l.f. brush I was impressed and have actively sought more since.  They run $1 per brush at bargain stores like Grocery Outlet and Big Lots, but those stores don&#x27;t consistently have them.  When I saw a set of 12 offered for $12 here on Amazon I had to get them!  I made a great choice!  The eyeshadow brushes hold product, foundation brush blends nicely, everything works as it should.  I have never owned the high dollar brushes by MAC (or similar), so I can&#x27;t compare these to them.  All I can say is they get the job done much better than other cheap brushes I&#x27;ve had the misfortune of trying to work with in the past.  Also they got here quick, which is always nice.</li>
    <li> When I opened these brushes I was very impressed and was excited to try them. I started to open them and check them out. About half of them are good and feel nice and soft, but the other half SHED like crazy! Before I use a brush I like to wash it and about 4 of the brushes made my hand covered in hair. The eyeshadow brush also fell right off the stick. I&#x27;m not even going to try the All Over brush because that thing is scratchy! But the other half of the brushes are very good quality and I can&#x27;t wait to try them!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many of their brushes and at first they work quite well. not the softest but still work. After about a month my foundation started getting loose bristles and eventually, all of them fell out. Bummer. I would rather have more expensive brushes that last way longer.</li>
    <li> Great service and i loved the product!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes and for the price they can&#x27;t be beaten. They aren&#x27;t the best quality, but again, for the price they&#x27;re really nice. Not scratchy on my face. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet so time will tell.</li>
    <li> Cheap Elf product brush came off in few used brush are stiff too.</li>
    <li> I bought this set almost a year ago and these cheap little brushes have held up BEAUTIFULLY. Granted, I don&#x27;t do cosmetology. But for basic make-up and occasional touchups I highly recommend this set. These might also be good for those LEARNING how to do makeup, since they do cost so little.</li>
    <li> Big two brushes do shed and are not that soft but beside that the other brushes are fine. Packaging and delivery was great!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for what you pay. Granted there are blush brushes that feel much better on the skin . However overall the brushes do the job and for what you pay. it is definitely a deal. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The heads of the brushes started breaking off after a month of use, it was very hard to work with after that. Not the hairs itself, the stick would break in half. So it is still usable but more annoying when you don&#x27;t have a handle on your brush.</li>
    <li> Great set for the price!  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with them breaking apart.  They apply evenly. I am happy with this set.</li>
    <li> Some brushes weren&#x27;t as soft as I&#x27;d woshed but that&#x27;s like 1 or 2. Overall i love this set and it&#x27;s definately worth it if you don&#x27;t feel like spending 20$ per brush</li>
    <li> these brushes are horrible, the big face brush and blush brushes are so poorly made that when i did my initial wash of these brushes they tangled and matted. these brushes are cheapy and poor quality brushes.i dont recommend at all. stay clear of these brushes!!</li>
    <li> The shipping was on time. The brushes were not damaged. The two big brushes were bad. I like only 7 of the brushes. I really think that it is a great deal buying these brushes but instead of the face brushes it is better to buy the black elf brushes. I hope this will help future buyers.</li>
    <li> For the price, its awesome. If you are anything like me and a novice in the makeup scene, these brushes come labeled. What more could you ask for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second set of these, because my cats LOVE the bigger brushes, which are the only ones I really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let your cats (or children) see them, or they won&#x27;t be yours any longer!</li>
    <li> I actually only ordered these for the &amp;#34;Smudge eye sponge&amp;#34; because I was having a hard time finding one ANYWHERE. Also, my friend highly recommended E.l.f. products to me. The brushes are nice, affordable and definitely worth it. If you want some makeup tools without spending an obscene amount of money, I&#x27;d definitely say give these a try.</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes for the price! so happy I ordered these instead of expensive ones because they definitely work..</li>
    <li> Well packaged and arrived on time - each brush was in its own package. Loved the packaging and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.  They help me to apply my makeup with more precision.  My sister is just becoming interested in using makeup and I have advised her to use brushes to do her application.  She loves how my makeup looks so I am recommending that she get herself a set of these brushes to begin...being that they are all labelled and the quality is beyond what you should expect at this price.  I only wish there was a stipple brush included in this super reasonable set.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, they are freaking awesome!! I use almost every single one of them for make-up. I highly recommend these to make-up artist!!!</li>
    <li> Love these still own will buy again</li>
    <li> Great brushes. More than I needed but I love the instructions that go with each brush. They are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Mines came in yesterday I absolutely love them and seems to be pretty good quality at a affordable price :)</li>
    <li> Pretty much every kind of brush you could ever want for one great price. Nice quality.</li>
    <li> good nice my gf loves them widely assorted and high quality good buy for professional make up artists or beginners</li>
    <li> They constantly shed and they don&#x27;t bounce back well from a cleaning. Good brushes are not inexpensive. Go for the good ones</li>
    <li> Of course, these are not MAC brushes but they are perfect for anyone who needs a set of good makeup brushes that can be used daily. They are also perfect for your teens that are starting to experiment with makeup. I was happy to see that they were very well recieved!</li>
    <li> My 15-year old niece was thrilled with this brush set that I gave to her for Christmas.  It&#x27;s not high end, nor does it need to be.  I wanted versatile and inexpensive brushes so that she had a lot to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; and learn with.  That&#x27;s what these will provide.  Perfect for the need.  Good price.</li>
    <li> This bundle is great and offers awesome variety. The price is super. These have provided good results, quality is good, and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> I love how fast I got it from the shipper. I will shop from this company again in the future</li>
    <li> Beginning in Makeup/Brushes found them very helpful. They brushes aren&#x27;t hard that scratch face or too soft that they fall apart. I didn&#x27;t even wash them before I used them and I didn&#x27;t break out at all. They are very good I recommend getting them</li>
    <li> So the price really isnt different than going to Target since each one is only a dollar at Target which means if you bought all 12 you would pay the same thing. However, it is nice being able to get all of them at once instead of going to multiple Targets since I rarely see Target ever carrying all 12 of these at the same time. The quality of the brushes is really good. I have other more &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brushes and I always find myself use the e.l.f ones instead. The shedding is minimal, and honestly, some of my Mac brushes shed more than these.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! My favorite is the eye shadow blending brush, it works very well. The only bad thing I would say about these is that some times the bristles come out. It&#x27;s not like I lose all of them just a couple. But overall these are pretty good makeup brushes!</li>
    <li> As a beginner you should get these, but eventually you should switch to higher quality ones like Real Techniques or Sigma. Now Elf is  a good brand (their black studio brushes are a bit more expensive I believe are good) but these brushes have no longevity. I wash them often but not daily because I care about my skin and they became hard and prickly and shed way too much. It wasn&#x27;t until I started getting Real Technique brushes did I realize how hard they were in comparison. If you&#x27;re just beginning and don&#x27;t do your make up often get these. If you intend on doing make up for a while and daily get a good brand of brushes that are only a bit more expensive. It will be worth it.</li>
    <li> When I got these in the mail, they seemed pretty decent for the price. However I washed mine. When I wash mine I stick them in cold water and dawn to loosen the powder. Then I rinse them a bit, give them a swish in the bowl. Then I fill it with as hot as I can stand water and dawn and let them soak for a couple minutes then swish them around. Make sure the water is clear, then give them a final rinse in a little vinegar. My other brushes with the plastic handles handled the washing just fine. These just fell apart, I didn&#x27;t leave them to soak for that long knowing that some of the brushes may not hold up. The hairs are comming out, the paint is cracking on the handle, and they are detaching from the handle. Don&#x27;t buy these its a waste of your hard earned money. Sonia Kashuk hold up better, I buy them on sale. I also go to craft stores and buy brushes with real hair. They last for ever and you can give them a good cleaning without worrying about them falling apart.</li>
    <li> The hairs are shedding the feel very course against the skin. Just not pleased.</li>
    <li> I think this is great for people just starting with makeup like myself, the main brushes I was looking for were included so that was definitely a plus</li>
    <li> These are very soft and distribute the powders evenly and smoothly.  Not much shedding and great quality.  I definitely recommend if you are on a budget and need some new brushes!</li>
    <li> Great set of makeup brushes. Don&#x27;t spend the money on expensive ones, these are perfect! All you will need!</li>
    <li> Very nice and affordable brush set. Works well. Very happy to have bought them!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend them to any one who is looking good quality stuff at affordable price!</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Brush come apart easily</li>
    <li> I loved most of this brushes, except for the total face brush an the bronzing brush, they smell sooooo bad and the hairs are red and weird looking, almost like natural hair and it&#x27;s kinda gross, they also leave hair behind it&#x27;s a drag but after a few washes they become acceptable. Other than that the rest of the brushes are great and do not have that terrible smell. I would say it&#x27;s a pretty good deal for ONE DOLLAR brushes, plus it&#x27;s more than good for begginers.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed in the quality of these brushes... half of them are not even usable. They shed, they&#x27;re poorly put together, they&#x27;re just bad.</li>
    <li> i should have gotten the higher quality brushes from E.L.F.</li>
    <li> I am late giving feedback on this purchase. I&#x27;m glad I waited; now I can say for sure that this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> 2 years ago I was never one to wear makeup but I love to now. This was my 1st makeup brush set that I purchased. I like how they give you a good variety of different brushes and tools to use. I thought this was a great 1st brush set for anyone who wasn&#x27;t too familiar to makeup or brushes and was a good product for the price. Now I have learned that there are much nicer brushes out there (the bristles on the brushes in this set are very coarse) that do cost more money, but I am happy that I started off with this set.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Would buy again</li>
    <li> Saw a lot of negative comments but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen it was great for 12 bucks</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and works great. Love how each individual brush came with its own case and is labeled.</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews about these, and finally decided on them rather than ecotools like I was using before. The only reason I chose these instead is because some people said that they liked these better than ecotools. Well, I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that some of these brushes are fine. The foundation brush worked well, as did the concealer brush (the larger one). I like the eyebrow tool. The face brushes are TERRIBLE. I have super temperamental and sensitive skin, and the face brushes were so scratchy on my skin that it was terrible and I&#x27;m not going to be using face makeup until my other brushes come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner brush is a joke. Not only were my bristles bent and curved when they came, they are so long that it just flings my gel eyeliner around, which I&#x27;ve never had happen before. I ended up using the small concealer brush for my eyeliner, which worked but not well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 eyeshadow brushes are fine, but they don&#x27;t really pick up the makeup well, and they are also pretty scratchy on my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy these again.</li>
    <li> GREAT LONG LASTING BRUSHES. SOME I DONT NEED... SOME R CHEAP. BUT ITS A GOOD PRICE FOR THE ONES I REALLY REALLY USE AND THEY DONT SHED AND THEY DO THEIR JOB. QUICK SHIPPING TOO !!</li>
    <li> Bargain, great brushes!</li>
    <li> Brush set offers a great variety of sizes and applications. Fantastic quality, esp considering the price.  Highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> loved these brushes! awesome prices for such a good quality. these brushes are very soft and dont shed at all. I would defiantly buy these, with no regrets! shipped fast and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail 3/11/13, placed Oder on 3/7/13.  So when it came in the mail I was like a kid at Christmas.  I have used these brushes so I know how they perform.  I Would purchase them at Dollar tree and Target separate types but I would get them.  After several usages and cleaning they hold up and work great.  I am glad to get the bulk I got two being a makeup artist and using make up myself I am so HAPPY!  I would recommend getting these brushes if your a student like me and have a budget to work with.  Work your stuff and get these brushes, I wanted to get the really expensive set, but I realized your using these now just get two sets and keep it moving and I did because I know how these work. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These are good brushes for the price of a dollar each!!!  But do not pay more than that!!!!  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I really like them. I&#x27;m still learning how to use all these brushes but I love these so far! Especially the blending eye brush, it cleans my mistakes!</li>
    <li> Great price for the product. No fibers have fallen out and I&#x27;ve had them for about three months now.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for a teenage niece , she was pleased with them. ELF has some nice basic products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used E.L.F. cosmetics for years now and they are not only cheap but decently good! I had bought some mineral makeup and so had my daughter. She decided she needed brushes, so I gave her mine. :( I thought I&#x27;d just go back to the &amp;#34;naked mineral&amp;#34; site and buy more but was sticker-shocked, so looked elsewhere. E.L.F. has excellent brushes, so thought I&#x27;d get them there. I was waiting on a deal in my inbox from them, when lo and behold, I looked on AMAZON and found a BETTER price! Now...I believe these are last year&#x27;s model--by that I mean, the new ones on e.l.f.&#x27;s website are a different style, a different color handle, etc, but the same brushes...so big deal. They would STILL be an excellent deal had I ordered them from e.l.f. but an even better one here on Amazon, with my prime shipping being free. $1 per brush? Come on! That&#x27;s a steal.  I put them in a beautiful Asian blue-and-white vase I got for $1 at the thrift store, and filled it a bit over halfway with rice to give my brushes something to stand up in.  I put the brushes, bristle-side up, into it and it sits on my dresser. It&#x27;s a great deal, this, and I am really happy with my purchase. The brushes are every bit as good and useful as the more expensive ones from &amp;#34;naked minerals.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. Everything I needed/wanted and such a good price. The quality is great for the price!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware you could buy so many brushes so cheap. just what I wanted, so I could replace my existing brushes</li>
    <li> This is a much better set of brushes than I expected for what I paid for it. The brushes are longer, fuller and softer than I would have expected to get for $1 each! Each brush is labeled with their intended use and overall I am very impressed with this set.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the quality of my M.A.C brushes here, and certain items (full face brush, blusher) were not that great But the other items were well worth it at less than a dollar per item on sale, comparable to the Sonia Kashuk ones I was getting at Target which cost way more (but still reasonable). Soft contour eye brush and blending brush are the best of the set I got.</li>
    <li> Each piece is just amazing. Its so soft that it feels like I&#x27;ve been using all of these brushes for a really long time</li>
    <li> Some of these brushes are better than others. Not a huge fan of the all over face brush. I feel like the bristles are too loose.</li>
    <li> very nice collection as a start some brushes are better than others, i don&#x27;t like the face brushes-rough and sheds.&lt;br /&gt;but overall I like the collection and the price. recommend it to a friend as a start.</li>
    <li> Very cheap made good-looking brushes, they are shedding like crazy....anyway, You get what you pay for !</li>
    <li> not all of the brushes are great they are just okay especially the face brush and foundation brush, however the eye brushes all works very very well you can use them for everyday makeup and keep your expensive ones for parties and occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price the eye brushes are very good. The face brushes not that much.</li>
    <li> i only used a few of the brushes once, the foundation brush was great, it made my makeup look flawless, eyeshadow brushes worked well too, but when i was trying to get the protector off the lipstick brush the the tip came off in my hand along with the protector, i pushed it back in and used it. other than that everything else was good.</li>
    <li> considering the price for 12 brushes they are good but not perfect ..&lt;br /&gt;the face and the contouring brush shed after i washed them&lt;br /&gt;but the others are fine and i use them alot&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad With this purchase</li>
    <li> I love love love my brushes. Their soft and work really well and help with the details in which I like my make-up to be. I will give 5 stars to my E.L.F cometics..</li>
    <li> Considering the price the quality is understandable. Great for a beginner but not if you want to last for a long time. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Cheap brushes, I guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I love their products. I would have purchased the item directly from them, had i known about the awesome deals that they give. I use the brushes every day and have not seen any issues. Cheap and good. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product since it ha a lot of good reviews. After a month I finally  purchased the elf  brushes. I was so happy when I finally got it in the mail. The brushes are not good quality, they shade a lot, even after washing them. The brushes are so bad, I ended up throwing them away. When you use them, they get stuck on your face ruining your make up. Buy these elf brushes at your own risk. Waste of money</li>
    <li> 12 brushes, you can always find the one you need :) they stay together also...</li>
    <li> I would buy ELF products with my eyes closed! I trust their brand and I am so happy that they are vegan and animal friendly and their prices, oh their prices, thanks to the Gods for ELF &amp;#60;3 NEVER CHANGE, ELF!</li>
    <li> when i got them i was very excited and i immediatly washed them. when they were try i touched the hairs they started coming off!! i was dissapointed because i like e.l.f but i do regret buying these</li>
    <li> One of my brushes broke when I took it out the pack. An easy fix though with a little super glue. They are okay.</li>
    <li> Very nice assortment of brushes at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I like the brushes a lot. You do get what you paid for but I think that these brushes are great for starters.</li>
    <li> I will probably never use all these brushes, but the ones I do are great. Why have I been using those little foam brushes that come with makeup kits? Where have these been all my life? Sheds a bit during first use for the foundation brush, and I had a head of one pop off (Super easy superglue fix, no biggie) Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This brush set is the absolute best for a beginner trying to get a grip on what each different brush is for. They can take a beating, and are pretty high quality for the price you&#x27;re paying. The fluffier ones do start to show damage after a while, but as long as you take care of them, these brushes will last you a while. And if they get ratty, it&#x27;s not a problem to replace!</li>
    <li> Its cool. Got every brush I need for now</li>
    <li> First the packaged arrived on time, which is a plus! The packaging was also great, all the brushes had their names on them, what their uses are, and comes with instructions on how to use them. I Just recieved them today and my next review will be on the pros and cons of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Not really happy with these brushes.  After washing them once (gently with dish soap and water) the brush bristles got ruined.  I do this with my other brushes and never have issues but these were the exception. I did not get them wet about the metal, washed gently, etc. and handled with care but they still got ruined.  I would not purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Nice set. It actually works for a beginner</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush set for the price i paid $12 (with prime).  I watched the item for almost a week before purchase. Price ranged from 12.99-25.99 during that time. If you get the set at the $12 price then you&#x27;re getting a bargin. Anything more and you&#x27;ve over paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have preferred the set had a carrying case but I&#x27;ll live without it. Each brush arrived individually wrapped and labelled so I won&#x27;t complain. I prefer that than a cheaply made case at any rate.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had really any problems with shedding, I just made sure to wash them before use. I did have the top come off of the blending brush, but a little bit of glue and its perfectly fine. I think you are getting what you pay for and for me, that is perfect.</li>
    <li> It was gift for somebody and I love it</li>
    <li> great deal i use them all of the time great buy compared to buying them individually sold at target store</li>
    <li> For the most part I really like them. They are decent especially for beginners. A couple of the brushes are really useless but other than that I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love love love these brushes!! They are my favorite. Great quality for the price. They were shipped quickly and I use them everyday!</li>
    <li> Very useful brushes, great variety, incredible value for a great product! I only wish the eyeliner brush was more stiff.</li>
    <li> Great assortment.  Good durable brushes</li>
    <li> This set comes with just about every basic brush you need. And the price is very cheap! (Most E.L.F. products are.)</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Good quality. Good bargain. Would recommend and do business with again.</li>
    <li> i only use the eyeshadow ones and the concealor paddle brush. the face brush hurts so much. hard synthetic fibers. go with eco tools, not that much more expensive and natural.</li>
    <li> They are worth your 12 dollars. Would have been a five but they are one dollar bushes and they do shed a little but otherwise awesome!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a bargain getting so many brushes as such a great price.  A majority of the brushes (the eye shadow related ones) have been fine. The angled bronzer and the main all-over brush, I was not impressed with.  The bronzer seems very small compared to other bronzer/blush brushes I have had.  It does not blend the bronzer well for me.  I have resorted to blending with my fingertips to get a more natural and non-clownish look.  The all-over brush seems cheaply made.  It had bristles sticking out of it that came out easily.  It also had what looked like a cow-lick type situation on one side where the bristles were all clumped down.  I tried washing the brush but the bristles would not straighten out.  The bristles themselves are not very soft.  I went back to an old makeup brush instead of using the all-over brush.</li>
    <li> This brush set is BY FAR the best value, especially for elf products!!</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected and all brushes accounted for.</li>
    <li> sister in law says it makes applying make up beyond simple. these are things i have no clue about....since its a girl thing. lol.</li>
    <li> Most all of the brushes are great, not the best quality but if your looking for something cheep and a good variety, its a good pick</li>
    <li> Love this brand! Great brushes for a great price.</li>
    <li> Great buy!! I found these brushes to be high quality for the price. I definitely recommend them! Throw out all your old ones!</li>
    <li> I love these. They are just the right sizes and have individual bags for each brush to use when traveling. I am extremely pleased with this product great find and great deal every thing is great love ELF</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price! Brushes are soft.</li>
    <li> important to consider the price paid for these.  Most of them are pretty decent brushes.  However, some arrived with the brush heads falling off.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong this brushes are great and they do what other brushes say they do but the price REALLY! did someone say ripoff. For the price they are selling this brushes you can purchase 29 brushes were ever they sell e.l.f. like Christmas tree shop, Dollar Tree, Target and many others. The place that I purchase e.l.f. brushes is at Dollar Tree for $1.00. Hope I was of some help. THE ONLY REASON I RATED THIS A 1 STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE NOT BECAUSE OF THE PRODUCT PERFORMANCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/17/2014: Seller changed price to a dollar per brush the item rating has changed do to that fact.&lt;br /&gt;I am doing an update review NOT purchased from this seller but from my local store.&lt;br /&gt;The e.l.f. brushed work ok they don&#x27;t last a long time but for the price who can go wrong, know my opinion on the e.l.f. Studio brushes which are $3.00 per brush now does are better and longer performance quality compared to the basic e.l.f. brushes, the studio brush in my case doesn&#x27;t have hair fall out and the brush handle is constructed from better materials and it doesn&#x27;t come apart like the basic brushes do.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s definitely other ELF brands that are better than this. This would be good for someone starting out or just needing this to travel or something. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to someone who&#x27;s intention is to use them regularly. Maybe a teen just starting out would like these.</li>
    <li> Looooooooooove my brushes. I&#x27;m a learner so I&#x27;m pretty excited to start using them! They&#x27;re amazing for the prize. I wish they had a purse to carry them in though.</li>
    <li> Great! Came in packaged nicely and ready to use. I love em!</li>
    <li> my first set of makeup brushes and the are very good i havent had any problems with everything is great i use them daily</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Bristles don&#x27;t fall out. Price is unbeatable. Caused me to purchase many other e.l.f. products and I am not disappointed with them either :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes. Work great with applying make up</li>
    <li> Perfect set.  The type of brush is actually on each brush.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! Especially the price! Very good buy</li>
    <li> I got them for my sister on her birthday, she seemed very pleased! They looked like a good quality and I thought they were a great buy!</li>
    <li> These brushes are terrible! The first time I used the eye shadow brush all the hairs fell out into my eye, extremely unpleasant!</li>
    <li> I noticed a lot of negative reviews about how this product smelled or brisels falling off. To be honest I did see that. But if you wash them it will stop smelling. I have always liked the ELF product line and have owned some brushes from them before. They work very well and seem to be okay. I don;t have any complaints and Im glad I purchased them.</li>
    <li> Ive now go a tool for anything and everything that I would want to do to my face. Love it.</li>
</ol>
