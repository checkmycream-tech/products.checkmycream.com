<li> I love the teenage dream polish under the black shatter!</li>
<li> Alone, it&#x27;s a little too sparkly for me, but looks just right with the shatter over it!</li>
<li> I love the nailpolish but whoever I bought it from gave me a used black shatter and it was gone after doing both my fingers and toes only one time :/</li>
<li> The katy perry pink color is so cute and the shatter adds an edgy twist!</li>
<li> The Teenage Dream is pretty, but the Black Shatter is not worth it.</li>
<li> it takes a while to figure out your own stride with the shatter, but if you mess up it comes off easily without having to mess up the base color.</li>
<li> The black really covers alot of the color, only little color shows through.</li>
<li> Short is the way to go for this look and start the black shatter polish back some from your cuticle.</li>
<li> let dry before applying the shatter.  </li>
<li> Black shatter has me becoming obsessed with OPI</li>
<li> /&gt;Update: Went to use the black shatter for the 3rd time and it was completely dry.</li>
<li> Different and edgy.</li>
<li> It does crackle, but looks too black for me and would not buy again for that reason.</li>
<li> it makes longer nails look very odd.  </li>
<li> I really like the teenage dream polish but the black shatter looks horrible.</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> Was kinda skeptical about the color and the effect that the black shatter would have.</li>
<li> What has worked well for us is starting off with a base coat, then the nail polish....</li>

    <li> Both the teenage dream nail polish look amazing as well as the shatter. it takes a while to figure out your own stride with the shatter, but if you mess up it comes off easily without having to mess up the base color.</li>
    <li> Teenage dream looks great by itself and with the shatter. Fast shipping too. Black shatter has me becoming obsessed with OPI</li>
    <li> I believe that black is the best shatter in the OPI collection. My daughter and I have used navy and turquoise OPI shatter and don&#x27;t feel that they crack as well.  What has worked well for us is starting off with a base coat, then the nail polish....let dry before applying the shatter.  Then applying a top coat.  The picture is true to what it looks like!</li>
    <li> The coolest thing I have ever used! The pink is gorgeous and so fun and the shatter is so so awesome! Shipped extremely quickly and was very happy with packaging and everything!</li>
    <li> I love the nailpolish but whoever I bought it from gave me a used black shatter and it was gone after doing both my fingers and toes only one time :/ I definately will buy another one but not from amazon.com</li>
    <li> Like always i love O.P.I. nail polish as well. It&#x27;s my NO.1 choice. Love it Love it Love it.LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> Great color combination.  The Black Shatter is very unique and gives a cool effect to your manicure. My home manicure lasted longer because the \\&quot;shatter\\&quot; effect hides any chips or wear in the polish.  Although I knew my nails were supposed to look that way, anyone who doesn&#x27;t know about Shatter may think you&#x27;ve been wearing the same polish for weeks b/c it could be mistaken as the polish having been chipped off.  Not a big deal though, this polish is great! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the shatter is awesome got here very fast and I love it I say its a must have in your nail collection</li>
    <li> Seller shipped it quickly and I received my package on time! The combination is nice, but I also put the shatter over a bright blue nailpolish and it&#x27;s even more noticeable and cute.</li>
    <li> The seller shipped these quickly so I received them in a week. The items were bubble wrapped. As for the colors, I love Teenage Dream. Its slightly sheer but has the perfect amount of pink and glitter.    The black shatter has looked good over everything I&#x27;ve put on. Work with it quickly though. It dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it! Looks beautiful in person, great on any skin tone. Different and edgy. This brand shattered works the best....I&#x27;ve tried many others, they don&#x27;t come close!</li>
    <li> I really like the teenage dream polish but the black shatter looks horrible. It really looks like you did a crappy job painting your nails. Didn&#x27;t care for this AT ALL. I even tried it with different colors to see if maybe it would look nicer..nope still looks craptastic.</li>
    <li> i got this for a friend and she totally loves it! The katy perry pink color is so cute and the shatter adds an edgy twist!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted shatter for like, 3 months now, but everywhere was sold out. I am SO happy that I bought it from Amazon, I got it 3 days from the seller, and It works amazingly! Teenage Dream color is simply beautiful!</li>
    <li> It came sooner than I thought it would!  It looks just like the photo.  Its easy to use.  I&#x27;ve used it with several colors and have gotten several compliments.</li>
    <li> Was kinda skeptical about the color and the effect that the black shatter would have. After experimenting, I fell in love and never looked backed! The teenage dream color is awesome; you can wear it alone or with the shatter and it will look awesome. A must buy!!!</li>
    <li> Seller listed everything correct and delivered quickly. Was suprised when my account was charged twice and I received 2 sets when only ordered one. Could of returned one, but already cut the top off the package and would have to get another bubble wrap and mail at the post office at lunch time. incovienent for me and just kept it. The black really covers alot of the color, only little color shows through. It does crackle, but looks too black for me and would not buy again for that reason. thought it would look more like pics in magazines.</li>
    <li> they look amazing when worn together. the black shatter is really cool looking and the teenage dream is a great sparkle nailpolish.</li>
    <li> The Teenage Dream is pretty, but the Black Shatter is not worth it. First, it clumps immediately &amp; if you get polish on the mouth of the bottle, good luck trying to open it again. I would definitely recommend getting the drug store version of the &#x27;shatter&#x27; effect. Shipped real fast though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Went to use the black shatter for the 3rd time and it was completely dry. I did not leave it open either, it was just a solid mass in there. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love the teenage dream polish under the black shatter! Alone, it&#x27;s a little too sparkly for me, but looks just right with the shatter over it! Both dry fairly quickly (the shatter completely dries within about 10-15 seconds) and last over a week with a couple top coat touch-ups in between. Definitely my new style for my nails! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> OPI black shatter polish is a great fun way to get salon looking nails! Teenage Dream polish by Katy Perry looks amazing under the black shatter!  I love these to products!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is very much a teenage dream...having two things go so perfectly together.  The picture is perfect, make sure to cut your nails shorter for this look otherwise it makes longer nails look very odd.  Short is the way to go for this look and start the black shatter polish back some from your cuticle.</li>
    <li> I have tried to use this multiple times and the crackle effect does not work. Do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> works as described, but I just didn&#x27;t care for the look on me.</li>
