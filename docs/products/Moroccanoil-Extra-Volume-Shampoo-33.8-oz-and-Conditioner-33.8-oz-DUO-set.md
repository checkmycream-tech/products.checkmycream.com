<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I always get this for my wife. It leaves her hair looking and smelling great!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase based on the price -but it was highly recommended by my stylist..I have always used salon products - just none quite this pricey -but 100% it was worth every penny -this is amazing!</li>
    <li> The product was fake. Was not a Moroccanoil product. Smells fake! I&#x27;ve purchase many moroccanoil products from Regis. The Shampoo has no smell. The Conditioner smelled horrible and extremely thin. DON&#x27;T NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly and is a great product.  I love Morrocan Oil!  I ruined my hair by coloring it too frequently a few years ago and I believe M.O products have saved my hair.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff for some reason. needs to be cheaper</li>
    <li> Love what this does for my hair! Perfect for  dry or damaged hair, this makes my hair feel silky soft! The soft scent that it has is amazing as well. Throughly enjoy these products!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!!! does wonders to your hair AND has an awesome smell. Makes the hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner you can buy!  Great feel to you hair and keeps it very healthy!</li>
    <li> The product is great but the packaging wasn&#x27;t the same as the past a a lot of product leaked.</li>
    <li> Love the way this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel and smell!!!  This is my second purchase of these products and I will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> This a not a genuine Moroccan Oil product. Both shampoo and conditioner are as fake as could be! Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> great product, smells great, keeps hair in perfect condition</li>
    <li> This product seems different. My hair is frizzy.</li>
    <li> Great product.... However when it arrived it leaked all over the box. Not happy</li>
    <li> By far these are the best products for any type of hair.  I also use their moose, styling cream and hairspray.  My hairdresser said why are you paying money to highlight your hair and using bad products? So I thought about it and tried Moroccan oil and my hair never looked more beautiful, shiny, soft and full of body and it smells wonderful too.  Great price for a top product that at Salons you will pay a lot more for.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo,&amp; conditioner. I first had it at the hairdressers. It&#x27;s very expensive, so when I saw these big bottles I bought them. You need very little so they lasted 6 weeks. Great buy when you consider how much the salon charges for a small size. And the smell is divine.</li>
    <li> Awesome product but package arrived in damaged condition:(</li>
    <li> When it came , both bottles were leaking , and I have use this product for years and I love the smell of it, these don&#x27;t smell like my usual stuff.</li>
    <li> Product great. However i recieved it and the bottles had leeked all in the packacage super mess. And waste of shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this product. The best thing I ever put on my hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> this shampoo and condictiner are the best for hairs like mine. They dont sell them in brazil, so i always have to buy in usa. I love those products and it is a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, all these products.  They smell heavenly and my hair is shiny, soft, and doesn&#x27;t need to be shampooed as often.  My hair has stopped breaking and is shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner - always gives my fine hair body!</li>
    <li> I thought it would moisturize my hair but makes my hair extremely tangled, but it smells nice. When the package arrived it was also busted open and leaking from the top which could have been avoided if they check the tops were twisted closed tightly before they shipped it.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think it is an authentic product. also, bottle was leaking when i received, despite them taping down the tops.</li>
    <li> Nice and keeps my hair soft and sleek.</li>
    <li> These products leave your hair feeling siilky and manageable, even in humid environments like Puerto Rico.  You only need to use small amounts of each product, so it lasts a long time.  I also use I squirt of the Moroccanoil  Original Treatment  on towel-dried hair before styling.  These products smell incredibly good too!</li>
    <li> I bought it last time it was good , but this time I don&#x27;t like it . I made an order for all hair , but you send me for the fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t mutch with my hair.</li>
    <li> Everything was great, but the lid was unscrewed on shampoo and shampoo leaked. Needed to seal the lid with tape</li>
    <li> Not sure if it was 100% Moroccanoil Shampoo</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo.  Works great for my hair and I love that it is sulfate free.</li>
    <li> This is not a real Moroccan Oil product. I purchased this with the hope that it would be as good as the stuff I buy at the salon. Instead of just being a poor product- something in the formula actually irritated my scalp so much that I scratched my scalp until it bled. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> this product is to die for......it smells like heaven and leaves your hair soft and healthy...i get a lot of compliments on the smell and body of my hair&lt;br /&gt;also the conditionar is not too heavy so it does not weigh your hair down like other products do</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything that you don&#x27;t already know.  I love all of the Morocanoil products.  The shampoo and conditioner is as great as the other products.</li>
    <li> This absolutely is NOT Moroccan Oil...Regardless of the bottle!!!  It makes my hair feel like straw!  Worse than any shampoo/Conditioner I have ever used.  I wish I could give it a negative star rating!  I am so mad that I wasted $100!!!</li>
    <li> Packaged well and the pumps were taped down do they don&#x27;t link. This smapoo and conditioner works great on my daughter blonde hair. She is a swimmer and is in chlorine all day.</li>
    <li> I am deployed in the miltary and the hard water damages hair. i started to shed and i have been using these products for over a year.. I brought the huge size to prevent running out while i am here. It smells good and works wonders for my natural hair (growing out my relaxer). I recommend you try it if you want soft hair and wants to save it from the damaged</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for sometime now and hate to run out and use other products. I have noticed no build up with this line and the conditioner works so great.</li>
    <li> Been using Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner for years, and for the last few years, have been ordering through Amazon with great success...Until recently, that is. Returned my last shipment because shampoo was spilled all inside of plastic wrap*. Next, I ordered the shampoo and conditioner set. The shampoo again had spilled, but I decided to use it anyway as I&#x27;d been without my favorite shampoo for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT the legitimate Moroccanoil shampoo! I started to work it in at the top of my head, and it didn&#x27;t lather at all. My hair that came into contact with it felt completely stripped (like right after you dye your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my scalp in that area burned slightly for awhile after rinsing. Goodness, what did they put in there?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Until these last 2 shipments, the bottles from other Amazon sellers arrived with regular caps on, pump cap sent loose, no plastic wrap, and no spillage whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Great love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes your hair very shiny and soft!  I really would recommend this to anyone, it works well on color treated hair too.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shampoo and conditioner. It leaves hair managable and silky smooth. It also has a great fragrance.Buy it</li>
    <li> the bottles were not properly closed and they spilled !!!</li>
    <li> This will be the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product from these guys. I was happy with the product the first time I purchased it, it smelled and felt authentic. I have no complaints at this time. I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Oil products for over a year and used to buy them straight from a salon before finding this vendor.</li>
    <li> cant say anything about the product because have not received it. And unsuccessfully trying to get my money back. first timy i have situation like this.</li>
    <li> Recently while traveling, I ran out of this Moroccan Oil product. I ordered through Amazon, and received the product as promised and am thoroughly satisfied. I would not hesitate to recommend Amazon and their suppliers and this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love the product.. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for years and love it.  I have curly hair that I highlight and color.  Moroccanoil is great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this product since my mom recommended it and gave me a set a while ago, it works beautifully and I needed to get some more, but the one my mom got me was the Moisture Repair. and I bought only the Extra Volume, which did not work the same on me. I rather buy the Moisture repair instead on the extra volume which does not detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> Am looking for less costly alternative to this product.  I love the smell and the oil is wondereful in taking out tangles but the cost is too much.  Lots of items now using this oil so will look for alternatives.</li>
    <li> I love these products. Makes my hair shine and very manageable. It is the only thing I use. I use the large bottles at home and take the small bottles on trips. I no longer use the hotel products as a rule since most have sodium laurel sulfate.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal.  If you buy at salon you pay way more.  I buy the 33oz. and it lasts a long time and you save about 100$.  Also Great service I got this 4 days after purchase.</li>
    <li> Best hair care products on the market. A little pricey but definitely worth the money! Especially love the hair oil!</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccan Oil products for 2 yrs. The shampoo and conditioner did not smell or look like genuine Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner. I already used it so I don&#x27;t think I can return it but would be interested to get my money back because it was filled with some cheap other product.</li>
    <li> I found that the Conditioner was excellent. Had a little problems with the Shampoo, didn&#x27;t want to lather. My stylist said to use more water on the shampoo and that worked out find. I am pleased with both of them.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received my conditioner and the pump was cracked off.  Packing should have worked but did not. I would gladly accept a new pump instead of returning the product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I have &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; hair, so it&#x27;s not curly and it&#x27;s not straight...but gets frizzy if there is an ounce of humidity. This product calms hair down without leaving it flat or greasy looking.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser and friend told me about this product. So I thought I would try. I bought a smaller version to try and was so happy. I have received many comments on my hair. So when I ran out I thought I would try another product Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing All in 1 Combo Set III. I wish I had not tried the other product and just bought this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair so I use the one for Volume. If you have thick hair I would use the other one they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is so thick I have to wet a little to get a lather. Makes my hair feel course when using and feels like my hair and scalp have been cleaned really well. Smell is OK, but is nice after you use the conditioner and makes the hair smell good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;This is the best part. It is so thick my hair drinks it up. Makes my hair shiny and so soft. Does not make my hair oily which is a plus with thin hair. I have no frizz when I dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried others and they make my scalp snow which is super gross. This one actually heals my scalp, I do not itch it as often using this product and no snow. I do have a sensitive scalp as an FYI.</li>
    <li> Fake! Fake! Fake!.. I opened the package and both bottle were damaged with dried shampoo and conditionar on the outside. .. to me it looked like they put cheap shampoo inside the bottle .. this is ridiculous .. I know Moroccanoil and THIS IS NOT THE REAL ONE ! DO NOT BUT THIS !</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Excellent service!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic.  I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Makes my hair &amp;#34;play nice.&amp;#34; I have such nice hair texture and it brings out my natural volume and body.</li>
    <li> I love this product but when it was delivered the to the hair conditioner was not on and there was hair conditioner on everything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been particular about my hair which is pretty thick and course, so I&#x27;m very particular about the shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of high end brands (Kerastase, when you couldn&#x27;t buy it in the U.S.), but I LOVE this so much more.  The shampoo cleans very well, typically with just one use.  And the conditioner actually stays with your hair, rather than completely rinsing out.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is heavenly.  I love it and recommend it all the time.</li>
    <li> My hair was very dried out from changing color too often.  I had been using Zerran products and they were ok but my hair still looked  overprocessed.  So, my new hairstylist suggested this brand of shampoo and conditioner.  I didn&#x27;t try it until a few months later but when I did....WOW!!! noticable results in just one use.  I have fine hair and it did not weigh it down at all and my hair was uber shiny! I really appreciate this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, good value</li>
