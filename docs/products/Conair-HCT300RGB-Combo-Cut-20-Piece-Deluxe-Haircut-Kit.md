      <li>second trimmer I purchased is fantastic, not to say this one isn&#x27;t but for my thick hair the other Conair trimmer was better for me.</li>
      <li>other issues with this set are that the case doesn&#x27;t stay closed so many times now</li>
      <li>and who really needs that many combs?&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t bad for the money I guess, but I still wish I had gotten something else.</li>

<li> /&gt;Other things are of minor note-</li>
<li> so if you&#x27;re like me and cut the hair around the ear area last, BE CAREFUL IT WILL BURN THEIR EAR!&lt;br</li>
<li> and that&#x27;s about how long it lasted...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a very long time and my previous Conair trimmer lasted for 11 years, actually the trimmer still works but the power cord was loose</li>
<li> We have been using this product for a couple of months now and it seems to be working as expected.  </li>
<li> the trimmer thing is pretty much useless-</li>
<li> bought this for a gift,  have not heard a bad thing about it, so it must be working out just fine.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t know if it was because of my thick hair or if that specific trimmer had a problem</li>
<li> this trimmer feels a little lighter and less sturdy but it does the job</li>
<li> This all in all isn&#x27;t a bad set, but it does heat up really quick</li>
<li> have very thick hair and once ever two or three minutes the trimmer would briefly pull on my hair, one strand at a time.</li>
<li> Sharp, i have thick steel hair</li>
<li> The trimmer is battery operated and does a decent job cutting my mustache and goatee.</li>
<li> the small clipper does not work well at all....</li>
<li> I would not recommend this product if you need the small clipper~</li>
<li> The case is like a small plastic shoe box.</li>
<li> Now, after few months of purchase, motor sound is terribly irregular and does not cut hair well.</li>
<li> We use it for basic cutting of my son&#x27;s hair about every 3-4 weeks.  </li>
<li> I have had to crawl under my bathroom sink and retrieve all the pieces, which is annoying-</li>

    <li> large clippers dont cut silky hair well</li>
    <li> Sharp, i have thick steel hair and i wear a superman shirt so i need a really sharp good pair of cutters, these are good even though the little set has problems i had to get a new one of them  is why i gave it a 4, i got this in good time.</li>
    <li> works greate. Happy to get this product. it includes a small rasor which works great abd very usefull.</li>
    <li> the small clipper does not work well at all....&lt;br /&gt;the large clipper is fine. I would not recommend this product if you need the small clipper~</li>
    <li> Provides a great close cut.  I would purchase this again in a heartbeat.  I also purchased it for a great price!</li>
    <li> Thank you, 5 stars from me</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for a couple of months now and it seems to be working as expected.  We use it for basic cutting of my son&#x27;s hair about every 3-4 weeks.  Our last Conair lasted for about 2 yrs, but for the price you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> No complain.  we used it for our son since he was 6 months, and it works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all love it.</li>
    <li> Excelente inversión, rasura el cabello de manera perfecta y todos sus accesorios son muy completos.</li>
    <li> bought this for a gift,  have not heard a bad thing about it, so it must be working out just fine.</li>
    <li> nice clippers, nothing awesome but they are lightweight and work well for buzzing my head at home.  would recommend works as well as my wahl balding clippers.</li>
    <li> My hobby already brought a set with telling me so I was gonna sent it back . But than I was gonna buy pet chipper always so I wanted to try these . It took about an hour and 30 mins for each cat . I have four yes i am a cat lady . But it did the job so I&#x27;m very happy I found another used for these .</li>
    <li> Excelente producto! Todo en orden... Recomendado totalmente! Todo el proceso resulto satisfactorio, no hay nada de lo que pueda quejarme.</li>
    <li> This set is the ideal solution for the home barber. It works perfectly to give me a terrific hair cut every time.</li>
    <li> I bought a conair kit like this for around the same price about 5 years ago and that&#x27;s about how long it lasted...this trimmer feels a little lighter and less sturdy but it does the job well. I cut my own hair and my son&#x27;s hair and this set has worked great. The extra trimmer is convenient too and a nice little bonus.</li>
    <li> It works well enough but my boyfriend says that it tugs sometimes at his hair. We haven&#x27;t used the trimmer yet.</li>
    <li> I like this. It is lightweight. The case is very comfortable. Excellent product. Highly recommended. Thank you so much. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a very long time and my previous Conair trimmer lasted for 11 years, actually the trimmer still works but the power cord was loose so it was time to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit was great, it came with a hard case and all the parts I need to cut my hair but there was a little problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and once ever two or three minutes the trimmer would briefly pull on my hair, one strand at a time. OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it was because of my thick hair or if that specific trimmer had a problem but I returned it and purchased a different Conair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer I ended up with was &amp;#34;The Chopper 2-in-1 Customer Styler - 24pc Clipper/Trimmer.&amp;#34; Of course, also an Amazon purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second trimmer I purchased is fantastic, not to say this one isn&#x27;t but for my thick hair the other Conair trimmer was better for me.</li>
    <li> buena calidad de la maquina  y llego antes del tiempo estimado bien en balado, y en buen estado recomiendo al vendedor.gracias</li>
    <li> These are Good clippers for the low price.  It cuts my hair pretty well.  The blades heat up really fast(which is a problem).  The trimmer is battery operated and does a decent job cutting my mustache and goatee.</li>
    <li> Initially It worked good but just after few weeks it started producing irregular sound. Now, after few months of purchase, motor sound is terribly irregular and does not cut hair well.</li>
    <li> Love love love this hair cutting set!! Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. A lot of plastic. The case is like a small plastic shoe box. But it works for what I need it for. So it&#x27;s OK.</li>
