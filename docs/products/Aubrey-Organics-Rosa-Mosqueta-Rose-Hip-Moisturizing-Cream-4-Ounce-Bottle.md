      <li>I love the way it comes on smooth</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s most wonderful little helper.  </li>
      <li>Easy to blend.  </li>
      <li>skin is fairly dry, so this formula is ideal for me.  </li>
      <li>Many times I&#x27;ve applied it to rashes, irritated skin, mild burns and</li>
      <li>Also, it is important to note that the product has a strong, flowery fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked this so much</li>
      <li>Also the smell is light and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, smooth like silk, moisturizing but not greasy and no icky chemicals!  </li>
      <li>Also, the fragrance fades to a pleasant level that I actually enjoy shortly after I finish my morning make-</li>
      <li>Not sure it works for everyone but for me it&#x27;s one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever found in my life.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;May be too rich for some skin types&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
      <li>This is a great cream for dry skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;This really is great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>i live in &amp;#34;dry heat&amp;#34; arizona and also have dry skin, so i find this moisturizer perfect.  </li>
      <li>I really should order more of this stuff.</li>
      <li>happy to say this stuff calmed things down immediately and my skin just drank it up.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite organic face lotion.</li>
      <li>-- it is no longer good for dry (or arguably any) skin</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fun and easy to make and nourishing for both my skin and hair, so admittedly, I have not been using Aubrey as much as I used to.  </li>
      <li>If you have oily skin, this would not be the best choice for you, however for dry or even mixed skin type</li>
      <li>I like how it goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and many products</li>
      <li>well with no greasy feeling if the right amount used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has a very very light rose smell and is thick.</li>
      <li>I use only Aubrey skin care products since I&#x27;ve had such great luck with them.  </li>
      <li>Got home, applied some of this magical goo and while the areas are still red I can walk without irritation.  </li>
      <li>so I read the reviews on Amazon of many of the Aubrey products and went out to my local Vitamin Shoppe to buy them.  </li>
      <li>Goes further and works better for me.  </li>
      <li>Yes, most definitely.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many things, and actually my skin has gotten pretty used to the Retin A.</li>
      <li>The packaging needs so much help and updating!</li>
      <li>Great product, lousy bottle, strong flowery fragrance</li>
      <li>: I found a wonderful pump that resolves the difficult to squeeze bottle issue -- it&#x27;s the High Volume Pump (fits 2-4-8 oz bottles) from Body Logic (ebodylogic.com)</li>
      <li>Might be good for dry skin, but not very dry skin  </li>
      <li>All natural  Mild fragrance  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have break out problems, and purely using Retin A for wrinkle prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>to be consistent in my reviews, I should point out that only recently have I started making my own skin moisturizer that I am very fond of - using shea butter, argan, coconut and avocado oil with just couple of drops of lavender oil...  </li>
      <li>You put this on and your hands look and feel better, then later when it soaks in your hands look a little better than before you used it.  </li>
      <li>and you can really feel the difference.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this at an Earthfare store as I was wanting a chemical free facial moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>and I can feel that my skin absorbs this really well.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not too much and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog any pores.</li>
      <li>I needed something fast -</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much to cover your face.</li>
      <li>I love this cream as it does not burn your eyes and only contains natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>But I wanted to give it a chance, so I experimented successfully by spritzing my face with a mist (usually rosewater) first, and while my face is still damp, spread out a tiny dab of this cream.</li>
      <li>I put it on before bed and my extremely dry skin still feels and looks soft and smooth when I awaken... very different from the many alcohol-laden products.  </li>
      <li>I truly love and appreciate the fact that Aubrey Organics DOES indeed use ONLY natural and organic ingredients in their cosmetic line, unlike many other companies who claim to be \\&quot;organic\\&quot; while their products contain petroleum based components and additives.&lt;br /&gt;Since discovering Aubrey, I have given up on all the other commercially produced skin and hair products and have used theirs for many years exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was able to find not only this moisturizing cream, but also the cleansing cream and toner in this same Rosa Mosqueta line.  </li>
      <li>I use it all over but mainly my hands and face.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure my skin is dry enough for it.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a new staple in my products.</li>
      <li>My face feels very soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also very sensitive to smells.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, but it loves this product.  </li>
      <li>As another reviewer pointed out, it might be too rich for other skin types.  </li>
      <li>I recently tried to switch to a more natural foundation with less chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Every time I use it straight (only a dab!)</li>
      <li>I have supper sensitive mature skin.</li>
      <li>I also bought a moisturizing mask from Aubrey that is designed for sensitive skin - it&#x27;s called Vegecol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I looked at my face closely in a magnifying mirror and realized all the skin on my cheeks was very dried out and was actually becoming flaky.  </li>
      <li>To me, it smells a little like cheap cream you might find at a drug store several decades ago, but since it is natural, I do not mind at all.</li>
      <li>The cosmetics industry is totally un-regulated and the majority of products contain harmful toxins - the skin is the largest organ and toxins on the skin go straight into our internal organs</li>
      <li>My hands are super dry and they definitely benefit from this product although I don&#x27;t use it as a hand cream too often - could get costly if I apply several times a day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  heavy enough to be a good night cream but not so heavy that you still feel it on your skin the next morning.  </li>
      <li>I developed a rash along my jaw line with a lot of red itchy pimples.  </li>
      <li>Tried it a few times, and I&#x27;m not crazy about it.    </li>
      <li>know dry hands because I live in northern wisconsin and winter</li>
      <li>I was a little concerned because the Rose Mosqueta products have a fairly intense fragrance (it reminds me of the original Jergen&#x27;s hand lotion), and I thought it might make things worse, but I was wrong.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Purchased this at an Earthfare store as I was wanting a chemical free facial moisturizer.  I am using Dry Skin \\&quot;1\\&quot;.  The first ingredient is Coconut Fatty Acid Cream Base.  No drying alcohol in the ingredients.  I apply it after my vitamin C/Ferulic acid has a chance to absorb in the mornings, and before my sun screen and foundation.  It SLIDES on-so silky it is amazing.  Easy to blend.  Then it instantly absorbs and leaves a completely non -greasy base for my sunscreen and foundation.  Skin just feels dewy and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if the manufacturer could add a chemical-free spf 30 or greater component without changing the non-greasy feature.  That would save an extra step in my regimen. Also, I purchase from Amazon often so will definitely be doing price comparison shopping when I re-stock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for at least 15 years.  I found it by accident when it was recommended to me at a health food store in LA after I had been in the sun for 10 days in July at the Colorado River.  One day there it was 134 degrees.  I&#x27;ve been going to the deserts around So Cal all my life and this stuff works.  I now have my wife and my two daughters using it.  Moreover, it seems for me at least to have healing qualities.  Many times I&#x27;ve applied it to rashes, irritated skin, mild burns and so forth and it&#x27;s relieved pain and improved the sore area.  Just today I went on a three hour beach hike that included swimming, going through beach caves to get through a cliff face, tide pools, and so forth.  I had to carry my kids through several areas.  At some point I got sand in my swim trucks and before AI knew it I had a great rash going.  Got home, applied some of this magical goo and while the areas are still red I can walk without irritation.  Not sure it works for everyone but for me it&#x27;s one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever found in my life.  Expensive but worth it.  I&#x27;d say the harsher your environment the more performance you&#x27;ll see from this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion of all time!  Smells amazing, smooth like silk, moisturizing but not greasy and no icky chemicals!  Love it!</li>
    <li> sorry! this product did not deliver as i expected. The reviews were good, that&#x27;s why i bought it. what a dissapointment.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and love it.  It keeps my skin healthy.  I use only Aubrey skin care products since I&#x27;ve had such great luck with them.  I have sensitive skin and many products make my face break out.  So, I&#x27;m very happy with Aubrey.</li>
    <li> Pros:   All natural  Mild fragrance  Affordable  First ingredient is coconut base, not water    Cons:  Doesn&#x27;t last all day  Might be good for dry skin, but not very dry skin  Does not moisturize very deeply  Bottle is difficult to use</li>
    <li> Edited 10/13/12: The formula was changed and the product now contains 2 listings of alcohol and at the highest level -- it is no longer good for dry (or arguably any) skin and you can really feel the difference.  What a shame! Best to go to truthinaging.com to find more pure and truly healthy products to replace this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former title: Great product, lousy bottle, strong flowery fragrance&lt;br /&gt;This is an outstanding moisturizer! I put it on before bed and my extremely dry skin still feels and looks soft and smooth when I awaken... very different from the many alcohol-laden products.  The unfortunate thing is that the bottle only comes in a 4oz size and it is very difficult to squeeze the contents out.  Also, it is important to note that the product has a strong, flowery fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: I found a wonderful pump that resolves the difficult to squeeze bottle issue -- it&#x27;s the High Volume Pump (fits 2-4-8 oz bottles) from Body Logic (ebodylogic.com)</li>
    <li> My new favorite organic face lotion. I like how it goes on smooth and dries fast. Also the smell is light and not overpowering. I wish it had some sun screen already in the lotion, then it would be perfect. I plan to buy this again and again. I think it&#x27;s a new staple in my products.</li>
    <li> I really should order more of this stuff. I really like it.</li>
    <li> You know how some lotions you rub on and it seems like it&#x27;s helping while it&#x27;s on but then once it wears of your hands look and feel bad--this stuff is the opposite of that.  You put this on and your hands look and feel better, then later when it soaks in your hands look a little better than before you used it.  Keep using it and you see improvement because it is healing your skin, improving it!  Not just coating it and filling in the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know dry hands because I live in northern wisconsin and winter is painful on the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to water it down with spring water to about half concentration as I find it too thick.  Goes further and works better for me.  I use it all over but mainly my hands and face.</li>
    <li> I use Retin A and well that means REALLY DRY SKIN. I&#x27;ve tried many things, and actually my skin has gotten pretty used to the Retin A. I don&#x27;t have break out problems, and purely using Retin A for wrinkle prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is great for dry skin. I am not too fond of the smell, but it&#x27;s not overbearing or anything. I love the way it comes on smooth and I can feel that my skin absorbs this really well. I liked this so much I just purchased the oil. A little of this goes a long way as well. I&#x27;d say a dime size drop for your entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** ON ANOTHER NOTE: SHIPPING IS MORE LIKE FIVE DOLLARS AND NOT THE NINETY NINE CENTS STATED HERE.</li>
    <li> Tried it a few times, and I&#x27;m not crazy about it.    It creates that filmy feeling of stuff just sitting on your skin.  Doesn&#x27;t absorb and moisturize.    After letting it be for a time I had to rinse if off, and my skin felt as dry as ever.</li>
    <li> Trying to write a review but it keeps disappearing on me. All I can say is that this cream is the VERY BEST EVER . Cracked fingers and dry hands. Bad hand rashes etc etc. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream as it does not burn your eyes and only contains natural ingredients. The cosmetics industry is totally un-regulated and the majority of products contain harmful toxins - the skin is the largest organ and toxins on the skin go straight into our internal organs</li>
    <li> i live in &amp;#34;dry heat&amp;#34; arizona and also have dry skin, so i find this moisturizer perfect.  it&#x27;s not too much and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog any pores.</li>
    <li> I recently tried to switch to a more natural foundation with less chemicals.  Everything was okay for a week or so, but then my face started to itch and feel irritated.  I developed a rash along my jaw line with a lot of red itchy pimples.  I looked at my face closely in a magnifying mirror and realized all the skin on my cheeks was very dried out and was actually becoming flaky.  I just had a really bad reaction to the new makeup, so I went to my dermatologist and she gave me a trial sized tube of a pharmaceutical cream that costs like $200 a tube (Protopic).  I should have known something was up when she also gave me a coupon for $40 OFF my prescription!  Well - after reading the side effects on the cream (lymphoma has been reported in animal testing (animal testing?!?! what jerks), there was no way I was going to use it on my face.  I needed something fast - so I read the reviews on Amazon of many of the Aubrey products and went out to my local Vitamin Shoppe to buy them.  I was able to find not only this moisturizing cream, but also the cleansing cream and toner in this same Rosa Mosqueta line.  I also bought a moisturizing mask from Aubrey that is designed for sensitive skin - it&#x27;s called Vegecol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say this stuff calmed things down immediately and my skin just drank it up.  I was a little concerned because the Rose Mosqueta products have a fairly intense fragrance (it reminds me of the original Jergen&#x27;s hand lotion), and I thought it might make things worse, but I was wrong.  It was just extremely calming and moisturizing and my skin recovered in only a few days.  Also, the fragrance fades to a pleasant level that I actually enjoy shortly after I finish my morning make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This line of products will now be my every day skin care routine, along with nightly applications of Sibu Seabuckthorn Oil (for roseacea I no longer have :)).  I feel very good about this manufacturer - no parabens, organic ingredients, products that work, noanimal testing, prices are very reasonable and product is readily available.  Defintely recommend this for irritated, dried out, sensitive skin.  I look forward to trying more of their stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream for dry skin but I&#x27;m not so sure my skin is dry enough for it. Every time I use it straight (only a dab!), my face starts to feel oily and break out. But I wanted to give it a chance, so I experimented successfully by spritzing my face with a mist (usually rosewater) first, and while my face is still damp, spread out a tiny dab of this cream. I use it this way only about once a week and it has worked out well. I also like that this does not have SPF so that I can use it at night. To me, it smells a little like cheap cream you might find at a drug store several decades ago, but since it is natural, I do not mind at all. My hands are super dry and they definitely benefit from this product although I don&#x27;t use it as a hand cream too often - could get costly if I apply several times a day. My mom has flaky skin on her legs and during her visits she said it has done wonders for her legs, but again, can get costly once this becomes a body cream! The packaging needs so much help and updating! Not quite as frustrating as getting ketchup out of a glass bottle, but really, the company could really redesign the way the product is accessed and update the look while they&#x27;re at it. My particular bottle also had 2 large dirty UPC labels slapped on which makes handling it not very pleasant, but I think this was done by the seller I purchased from and not Aubrey. I appreciate this product and will purchase again when I run out. I plan to try other Aubrey products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Silky texture&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well with no greasy feeling if the right amount used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;May be too rich for some skin types&lt;br /&gt;Smells old-fashioned&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to get the cream out of the plastic bottle</li>
    <li> Terrific organic product which Aubrey no longer makes.  I have very sensitive skin, but it loves this product.  Can&#x27;t imagine what I will use when my supply runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a year.  It&#x27;s  heavy enough to be a good night cream but not so heavy that you still feel it on your skin the next morning.  My skin looks brighter and fresher with this cream.</li>
    <li> I tried it using on my face but it causes skin break out.I have a dry skin but it  doesn&#x27;t agree for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin. This stuff makes my face feel like a babies. I&#x27;m also very sensitive to smells. This has a very very light rose smell and is thick. You don&#x27;t need to use much to cover your face. I just love this stuff and would be heartbroken if they ever stopped making it!</li>
    <li> I truly love and appreciate the fact that Aubrey Organics DOES indeed use ONLY natural and organic ingredients in their cosmetic line, unlike many other companies who claim to be \\&quot;organic\\&quot; while their products contain petroleum based components and additives.&lt;br /&gt;Since discovering Aubrey, I have given up on all the other commercially produced skin and hair products and have used theirs for many years exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is fairly dry, so this formula is ideal for me.  As another reviewer pointed out, it might be too rich for other skin types.  Yes, most definitely.  If you have oily skin, this would not be the best choice for you, however for dry or even mixed skin type it&#x27;s most wonderful little helper.  I&#x27;d even put a little organic avocado or argan oil in it to make it little richer.&lt;br /&gt;It has kept my skin supple, moisturized, completely eliminating the unpleasant &#x27;pulling at your face&#x27; feeling that dry skin produces, of course it never clogs my pores and just feels wonderful to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin wholeheartedly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Just to be consistent in my reviews, I should point out that only recently have I started making my own skin moisturizer that I am very fond of - using shea butter, argan, coconut and avocado oil with just couple of drops of lavender oil...  it&#x27;s fun and easy to make and nourishing for both my skin and hair, so admittedly, I have not been using Aubrey as much as I used to.  Anyone can make their own concoction just as easily, but if you want to stick with commercial moisturizers, this one is definitely perfect way to go!).</li>
    <li> I have supper sensitive mature skin. This product works great. It soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. My face feels very soft.</li>
