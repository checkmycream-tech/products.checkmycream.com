      <li>This product smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to find quality without all the almost cult-like weirdness.  </li>
      <li>It has Patchouli and to be honest I have never used patchouli because I find the scent repulsive</li>
      <li>It is VERY strong.</li>
      <li>great minty aroma, nice for hot summer days</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t mind it, and it really seems to bliss out my cats, lol.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s ok if you like patchouli</li>
      <li>I do love it, however, the scent I smell the strongest is the mint.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying it in my diffuser, but if you&#x27;re not a patchouli or peppermint lover, do not purchase.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off getting &amp;#34;Clear</li>
      <li>However, if you love patchouli, then you should get this.</li>
      <li>I love patchouli.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be really pleased with this blend.  </li>
      <li>I love it...</li>

      <li>Again, if you love patchouli, you should love this.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this blend.  </li>
      <li>There are those that complain about the patchouli in here, but I love that scent anyway.  </li>
      <li>I will probably gift this to someone who likes the scent more than me.  </li>
      <li>I initially liked this product in my diffuser but it quickly became overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Amazon is a great place to buy items that you are familiar with, or willing to take a chance on.  </li>
      <li>What I love most about this is that I don&#x27;t have to join some MLM monthly subscription program or become a direct distributor to get a good price--if you&#x27;re into oils you know what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>
      <li>you will probably enjoy this more than I did.</li>
      <li>I have been adding a drop to my hand cream at night before I go to bed, and I fall asleep quickly and feel more rested in the morning.</li>
      <li>I think they should list it as primarily mint.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this so much!</li>
      <li>Unique smell entranced me.  </li>
      <li>On a positive note, it is potent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m diffusing it right now while I work, as a matter of fact!</li>
      <li>I normally suffer from insomnia and this helps me fall asleep much more quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
      <li>There is nothing peaceful or harmonious about this scent.</li>
      <li>I think with essential oils, it is really important to note that scent is a really subjective thing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very calming to me, and my husband likes it too.  </li>
      <li>but I really want it going 24/7</li>
      <li>I did not read this one very thoroughly when I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I used just two drops and the patchouli scent was too much for me.</li>
      <li>I use it in my diffuser and it seems to really bring peace and calming to the house.</li>
      <li>I put a few drops in my bath, or mix it with distilled water and a splash of alcohol to make my own non-toxic body spray.</li>
      <li>This calms me right down and smells strongly of patchouli.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly patchouli with a little mint.  </li>
      <li>The description said it was similar to Young Living&#x27;s Peace and Calm which I really like.  </li>
      <li>Love a few drops of this oil on my bedspread at night.</li>
      <li>I bought mine on impulse at the check-out line at Natural Grocer&#x27;s for $5.  </li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t really seen it used in any of my essential oil blends by other companies.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love buying these blends because of their affordability and they are pre blended and give me some great options to mix. I did not read this one very thoroughly when I purchased it. It has Patchouli and to be honest I have never used patchouli because I find the scent repulsive and I haven&#x27;t really seen it used in any of my essential oil blends by other companies. So it&#x27;s ok if you like patchouli you will probably enjoy this more than I did.</li>
    <li> I failed to read the ingredients and patchouli does not calm me. The smell reminds me of a head shop and not exactly what I was going for. However, if you love patchouli, then you should get this.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing. I love it... I&#x27;m trying to use it sparingly but I really want it going 24/7</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews and I am patchouli lover, so I was looking forward to this. I do love it, however, the scent I smell the strongest is the mint. To me, peppermint and patchouli are at opposite ends of the aromatherapy scale, but what do I know? I am enjoying it in my diffuser, but if you&#x27;re not a patchouli or peppermint lover, do not purchase.</li>
    <li> I initially liked this product in my diffuser but it quickly became overwhelming. It is VERY strong. I used just two drops and the patchouli scent was too much for me.</li>
    <li> The quality is here, and I think if you like Patchouli you&#x27;ll be really pleased with this blend.  A little goes a long way, so 1 oz. is a whole lot of oil, lol.  I will probably gift this to someone who likes the scent more than me.  What I love most about this is that I don&#x27;t have to join some MLM monthly subscription program or become a direct distributor to get a good price--if you&#x27;re into oils you know what I&#x27;m talking about.  It&#x27;s nice to find quality without all the almost cult-like weirdness.  To address a lot of the bad reviews on this item:  I think with essential oils, it is really important to note that scent is a really subjective thing.  Just because I think it smells like a hippy flop house doesn&#x27;t mean that you will.  It&#x27;s probably best to smell these scents before you buy them.  Amazon is a great place to buy items that you are familiar with, or willing to take a chance on.  I bought mine on impulse at the check-out line at Natural Grocer&#x27;s for $5.  Like I said, this is a quality oil, but the scent isn&#x27;t for me.  Update:  When diluted and diffused properly, the scent grows on you.  I may make some candles using it and give those as gifts.  I honestly don&#x27;t mind it, and it really seems to bliss out my cats, lol.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a VERY unpleasant and artificial scent. From the moment I used it. I  kept waiting for peace and harmony to happen. It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this blend.  They used this on me at a spa appointment I&#x27;d had and I was hooked.  There are those that complain about the patchouli in here, but I love that scent anyway.  I diffuse this at home in the evenings.  It&#x27;s very calming to me, and my husband likes it too.  I also tried it in a homemade sugar scrub and it smells SO GOOD!  I have ordered this at least 4 times.  Again, if you love patchouli, you should love this.</li>
    <li> LOVE this blend. Put it in the diffuser at night and sleep like a baby. I normally suffer from insomnia and this helps me fall asleep much more quickly. If I hadn&#x27;t had the experience myself I would have called malarkey on anyone telling me how well it works. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this so much! I have been using this in a roller bottle blended with jojoba oil in place of deodorant. The patchouli isn&#x27;t overpowering but still noticeable. I recommend sampling this in a store before you buy online. if you buy something like this online without smelling it first, don&#x27;t complain about how it smells bad. You didn&#x27;t research well enough.</li>
    <li> Use it in my diffuser every day.</li>
    <li> I defuse this into the air with a Now diffuser in my home &amp; business. The air is calming &amp; smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a friend recommended it.  We both absolutely love the scent!  I&#x27;m diffusing it right now while I work, as a matter of fact!</li>
    <li> great price and product</li>
    <li> Love a few drops of this oil on my bedspread at night.</li>
    <li> This is good product.!!!</li>
    <li> great minty aroma, nice for hot summer days-I put it in my skin oil</li>
    <li> Unique smell entranced me.  Licorice and mint maybe?  Really nice!!!</li>
    <li> This smells great! I use it in my diffuser and it seems to really bring peace and calming to the house.</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a fair price delivered right on time. I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
    <li> The description said it was similar to Young Living&#x27;s Peace and Calm which I really like.  There is no similarity at all.  It only has two of the essential oils out of six.  It is not sweet smelling like YL.  In fact, I don&#x27;t like the scent at all.  It is odd and sour smelling.  Not calming in any way</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing.  I use it when I do yoga at home.</li>
    <li> This smells STRONLY of mint. That&#x27;s all I smelled. I was disappointed and hoping for something with other tones. It&#x27;s not what I expected. I think they should list it as primarily mint.</li>
    <li> Smells weird and not at all like I&#x27;d expected from the description.</li>
    <li> Hard to smell in the room.</li>
    <li> There is nothing peaceful or harmonious about this scent. It has a very heavy, musky smell and reminds me of an old water damaged basement. You&#x27;re better off getting &amp;#34;Clear the Air&amp;#34; which is also a NOW Foods product.</li>
    <li> Love it, smells great!!</li>
    <li> This blend smells so lovely, and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I put a few drops in my bath, or mix it with distilled water and a splash of alcohol to make my own non-toxic body spray. The patchouli is there, but not overpowering at all. A very nice blend.</li>
    <li> I got this to use with an infuser in my office at work, which is close to the front doors and the elevator.  When people come in I hear them exclaim to the receptionist &amp;#34;What is that smell?!  It smells like burning cleaning solution!&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s mostly patchouli with a little mint.  I&#x27;m not sure i would recommend it for a public place.  On a positive note, it is potent.</li>
    <li> I have been adding a drop to my hand cream at night before I go to bed, and I fall asleep quickly and feel more rested in the morning.</li>
    <li> This calms me right down and smells strongly of patchouli. I love patchouli.</li>
