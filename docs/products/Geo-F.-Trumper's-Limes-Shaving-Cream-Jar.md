      <li>I&#x27;ve used a variety of high quality shaving creams and this is very good.</li>
      <li>It smells great (the wife agrees), it gives a great lather, and is probably going to last like the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>A good cream however like most citrus scented products, the scent quickly fades when you are done shaving.</li>
      <li>I love the way this stuff smells.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used this scent before - glad I made the switch.</li>
      <li>I love using a brush.</li>
      <li>I would prefer a more citrus aroma than what this provides.</li>
      <li>SLS free!</li>
      <li>The smell, lathering, and moisture is top notch.</li>
      <li>I love this shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>I have tried the coconut cream and was pleased.</li>
      <li>Great Quality and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Was hoping for it to smell more like the skin food lime scent.</li>
      <li>Smells like lime popsicles, the cheap dual stick kind in the bag that comes with root beer and banana.</li>
      <li>With that said, for a more traditional shave with a brush, this is one of the best I&#x27;ve used in terms of lubrication.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scents are really refreshing as well.</li>
      <li>It lubes well and smells OK.</li>
      <li>Trumpers makes a quality shavong cream, what more can I say.</li>
      <li>but it is also the soap that provides me the best quality lather in the quickest possible time, while i will say the GFT Coconut Shaving Cream provides a better moisturizing experience while shaving, but i dont&#x27; feel that the limes shaving cream is lacking in moisturizing properties or anything</li>
      <li>Seems to do an okay job.</li>
      <li>I happen to love this lime fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Glad to see Amazon carry it.</li>
      <li>Nice rich later, great shaves!</li>
      <li>It smelled more like cheap bathroom soap.</li>
      <li>Lubrication is excellent with no razor drag.  </li>
      <li>Lathers up nicely, and has a fresh, clean scent (more citrus than limes to me exactly, but nice nonetheless).</li>
      <li>It lathers up very quickly and easily with a brush and does not collapse (unlike what I had been using).  </li>
      <li>Super comfortable shave, great scents, and reasonably priced within the luxury shave category.</li>
      <li>Since he won&#x27;t wear cologne (he doesn&#x27;t like the strong smell), he wears this instead.</li>
      <li>Scent is strong but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I wish this was as strong scented as the Castle Forbes Lime;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every shave cream available, from tube to tub, from cream to gel, and nothing quite comes close to Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s formulation.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this cream.</li>
      <li>Same quality you would expect from Trumper&#x27;s and a really great smell.</li>
      <li>Fantastic shaving cream.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the scent.  </li>
      <li>It reduces nicks considerably and has a great fresh scent that both men and women like.</li>
      <li>Much more dense than some of the other creams, it takes a bit more effort to get a good lather.  </li>
      <li>Hands down, the modern foamless creams/gels lubricate much better than the best imported foaming creams.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gives a great shave, uses less water in my experience than Proraso cream and lathers more.  </li>
      <li>More than likely a vintage Lime Barbasol, either way I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Lasts a long time and works great with the brush</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m familiar with the products.  </li>
      <li>I have a pretty good idea what a decent product should look, smell, and feel like.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m partial to the Lime scent, but they all give a great shave.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much.</li>
      <li>The Shaving cream has a nice soft consistency.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s somewhat sweet but not overly so or too fragrant.  </li>
      <li>They are strong enough to be refreshing while you are shaving, but mild enough to fade to a happy afterthought within the hour</li>
      <li>Gives a good lather, and leaves my skin looking healthy, but I would have preferred a slightly stronger scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is clean and fresh, and as shave cream</li>
      <li>the cream lathered very easily and felt soft on the skin.</li>
      <li>The tub it comes in is great and high quality and this cream should last quite sometime before you ever need to replace it.</li>
      <li>Just finished my first can of limes, and I&#x27;ll buy it again - after I use up my four cans of Trumper&#x27;s coconut shave cream!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great lather and a fresh lime scent</li>
    <li> This product smells so good on my husband.  Since he won&#x27;t wear cologne (he doesn&#x27;t like the strong smell), he wears this instead.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great.  I use the skin food for a pre and post shave so I&#x27;m familiar with the products.  Only issue I had was I opened the jar upon delivery and there must have been an air bubble when the product was put in the jar at assembly.  I peeled the plastic off the jar after unscrewing it and I could see a deep opening in the product.  I blew air in the little opening and it opened up to show there was only enough product to fill maybe half the jar.</li>
    <li> Nice, subtle, fresh lime scent.  Not overpowering, but a nice way to start the day.  Lathers up nicely, and has a fresh, clean scent (more citrus than limes to me exactly, but nice nonetheless).</li>
    <li> This is a very large quantity container but, it didn&#x27;t have the smell I was looking for. It smelled more like cheap bathroom soap. Otherwise nice lather and good shave.</li>
    <li> Great Quality and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Just finished my first can of limes, and I&#x27;ll buy it again - after I use up my four cans of Trumper&#x27;s coconut shave cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of high quality shaving creams and this is very good. It lubes well and smells OK. I would prefer a more citrus aroma than what this provides. When I&#x27;m in a hurry I typically use a foamless shaving cream/gel (Gillette, Neutrogena, etc.). Hands down, the modern foamless creams/gels lubricate much better than the best imported foaming creams. With that said, for a more traditional shave with a brush, this is one of the best I&#x27;ve used in terms of lubrication.</li>
    <li> Much more dense than some of the other creams, it takes a bit more effort to get a good lather.  Very good product, excellent shave and a decent smell.</li>
    <li> I was a Taylor of Bond fan until I started using Geo F. Trumpers, now I am fans of both!</li>
    <li> Thought that I would like to try some Lime shaving products, so I ordered some Geo F. Trumper Lime Shaving Cream and some Geo. F. Trumper Lime Skin Food.  The first thing that I noticed on the box was the little picture that indicated the pot contained a twelve month supply of shaving cream.  The second thing that I noticed was that the pot contains 200ml of product, as opposed to the Taylor Of Old Bond Street pots, which contain 150ml of product.  The third thing that I noticed was that the information on the box suggested going to the Trumper website for more shaving advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used both products, the shaving cream and the skin food as directed, so I used the skin food both before and after shaving.  Both products worked very well, with the most interesting thing being that the skin food felt entirely different when applied to the face before shaving and when applied to the face after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the smell of limes you will probably like these products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a shaving cream fanatic. I&#x27;ve tried every shave cream available, from tube to tub, from cream to gel, and nothing quite comes close to Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s formulation. There are other glycerin based creams that come close including The Art of Shaving, which is a darn good approximation of the Trumper formula, but at $25 for 4 oz (140 Grams) it is a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting, the Trumper scents are excellent. They are strong enough to be refreshing while you are shaving, but mild enough to fade to a happy afterthought within the hour so you are not the center of attention. I tried the Poroso sandalwood cream (in a tube) which was so potent that my wife made me throw it away after a few uses. On the other hand, she loves the Trumper version of sandalwood, which is a manly old fashioned barber shop scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my money, Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s is the way to go. Super comfortable shave, great scents, and reasonably priced within the luxury shave category.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift.  I enjoy the scent.  The lather is excellent.  But when I opened it new out of the box it was 1/3 empty. Literally from the top down to the very bottom of the jar it was empty space.  Very disappointing when a person pays good money for a product and that much is left out of the container.  I felt bad for the person who gave it to me as a gift.</li>
    <li> Geo F Trumper&#x27;s is an true traditional line up of shaving products. This cream does require basic knowledge of lather building with a brush and water, but is well worth the extra time and effort. The scent is subtle but fresh, I would compare it to a key lime pie. Another plus is a tub should last six months to a year. A must try for wet shavers!</li>
    <li> Smells faintly like Key Lime pie. Lathers up good (only a tiny amount is needed) and it rinses cleanly off the razor. Basically perfect in every respect.</li>
    <li> Lime fragrance is great.</li>
    <li> Seems to do an okay job. Got some skin irritation twice. Smells like lime popsicles, the cheap dual stick kind in the bag that comes with root beer and banana.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for beard, head, legs and underarms. It reduces nicks considerably and has a great fresh scent that both men and women like. (lime)</li>
    <li> I&lt;br /&gt;Love&lt;br /&gt;This&lt;br /&gt;Product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picked up an entry level DE starter kit: Merkur HD 34C, a few types of blades, a decent Parker badger brush, &amp; G F Trumpers limes shaving cream &amp; skin food. A few drops of water in a porcelain bowl, and the Trumpers shaving cream whips up into a thick lather in 30-60 seconds.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to get enough for three passes; this jar will last for a long time. Fantastic shaving cream. Love the subtle lime scent, and it gives a smooth glide the the razor whilst rinsing off effortlessly. Trumpers limes skin food is excellent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that I have no desire to try anything else. You&#x27;ll want to do three passes every time you lather with this product!</li>
    <li> Lathers very well and provides a smooth shave. However this scent is too faint and reminds me of dog shampoo. Was hoping for it to smell more like the skin food lime scent.</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for over 20 years! The best...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Trumper&#x27;s Limes for years. The scent is clean and fresh, and as shave cream it&#x27;s pretty much unbeatable. And, one jar lasts for months.</li>
    <li> The Shaving cream has a nice soft consistency. I bowl lather and I just use a small almond sized amount and it creates a surplus of lather. It is thick and without bubbles and goes on the face well. The smell is also incredible, I do not know if I have smelled a better shaving soap. The tub it comes in is great and high quality and this cream should last quite sometime before you ever need to replace it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it! His face is very smooth after shaving and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell which I appreciate. I also bought the Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Limes Skin Food (after shave) and my husband really likes that too.</li>
    <li> smells, feels and works pretty well.  It smells more like lime candy than actual limes and the lather is a little thin.  I think next time I&#x27;ll get the Vulfix Lime because I like the smell of real limes better.  I will use up the rest of this tub, though.</li>
    <li> I get a great shave from GFT products. I had tried the Rose scented cream jar previously and was also pleased with the product. In between that, I switched to a Taylor of Old Bond Street (Eton scent) shaving product -- it was better than the old Gillette brands, but not comparable to GFT. The price is almost a factor of two, but for me it is well worth it. A tub lasts quite some time, as I do not have to overcompensate for quality with quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are really refreshing as well. I will probably be trying a different scent when I run out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive monthly Birchboxes and quite often get shaving cream products, and I have yet to try one that surpasses the quality of the GFT ones.</li>
    <li> Seriously, once you use Trumper&#x27;s shaving cream you will NEVER go back to the cheap drugstore stuff. I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and used to buy it at Nordstrom. When they stopped carrying it, I suffered for awhile and then found it again on Amazon. One tub will last you for a good six months or more, as it only takes a little (dime size) dab rubbed between the hands to give you great lather. You don&#x27;t have to use a shaving brush at all, unless you really want to. I just use my hands. The smoothness and resulting shave is awesome. I&#x27;m partial to the Lime scent, but they all give a great shave.</li>
    <li> Probably the best of the famous 3 &amp;#34;Ts.&amp;#34; from England. Best prices on Amazon. Save 30-40%.</li>
    <li> I wish this was as strong scented as the Castle Forbes Lime; which I still prefer.  However, given the price, this isn&#x27;t bad.  Fave Trumper so far is Almond though...</li>
    <li> I have very hard water.  I read reviews here and there of creams/soaps where the reviewer says, &amp;#34;Lather exploded...&amp;#34;  With this stuff, hard water and a Semogue boar brush, lather truly does explode from the bowl.  I lather Mike&#x27;s Naturals Lime soap and an almond-sized dollop of this together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives a great shave, uses less water in my experience than Proraso cream and lathers more.  I like lime scent.  If you don&#x27;t, I&#x27;d recommend giving Trumper&#x27;s a shot in one of the other fruity flavors:)</li>
    <li> Great product! Lasts a long time, scent is not overwhelming and gives a fantastic shave!! Will buy again. Love it.</li>
    <li> Just like countless others, I have switched away from cartridge shaving to a safety razor.  Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Shaving Cream is a wonderful addition to my shaving set.  It lathers up very quickly and easily with a brush and does not collapse (unlike what I had been using).  I do not use any type of pre-shave treatment, and still my razor (set very aggressive) with this cream slides nearly effortlessly though any amount of stubble, even after a long weekend. The cream is moisturizing enough that I am not left with skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very (very, very...) faint, though I wash my face after shaving (super sensitive skin, and will react if I don&#x27;t).  As I have sensitive skin, I do not employ aftershave lotion either, nor do I feel like I need to.&lt;br /&gt;The jar is large enough that I believe it will last me for several months to half a year of daily shaving. I enjoy this enough, that I will continue to grab replacements as I need them.</li>
    <li> Trumpers makes a quality shavong cream, what more can I say. Great scent!</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream ever. Glad to see Amazon carry it.</li>
    <li> This is the one - incredible quality, super smooth, great scent, lasts forever. For wet shaving with a safety or straight razor, I think there is none better than the GFT products. Scent is a matter of personal preference, and I like the fresh citrus of the limes version, matched with the Limes skin food product afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Roses scent too - the quality is equal to this, but the scent just isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my brother as a gift and he promptly ditched the Gillette gel - thankfully!!!</li>
    <li> Great Lather, good scent, worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was expecting.  The lime scent is pretty powerful from the jar but is more subtle actually using it.  It takes next to nothing to lather it well (using my badger hair brush) and it washes easily off the blade.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using mostly Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Street shaving creams for a number of years.  A variety  of scents, with Avocado being my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; variety.  I have tried the TOBS lemon / lime and wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell.  So I tried the Geo. F. Trumper&#x27;s Limes.  Not a big fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful, and it&#x27;s easy to work up a good lather.  But at least for me, it&#x27;s an inferior product.  It&#x27;s just not as &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; as the TOBS product.  It&#x27;s also not as lubricating as the Col Conk hard soap I use when I travel.  With this product, I find I get a lot more razor drag and irritation, whether I&#x27;m using a DE safety razor (95% of the time), Mach 3 (3%) or straight razor (2%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any shaving product, your mileage may vary.  It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells. Makes a nice lather as well.</li>
    <li> Lathers easy and has a great smell!</li>
    <li> out of all the shaving products i have tried so far, this has been my favorite, not only do i enjoy the fragrance but it is also the soap that provides me the best quality lather in the quickest possible time, while i will say the GFT Coconut Shaving Cream provides a better moisturizing experience while shaving, but i dont&#x27; feel that the limes shaving cream is lacking in moisturizing properties or anything</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this cream. Same quality you would expect from Trumper&#x27;s and a really great smell. The scent takes me back to kindergarten when the teacher used to squirt a whole bunch of shaving cream on plastic and we would play with it. More than likely a vintage Lime Barbasol, either way I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> A good cream however like most citrus scented products, the scent quickly fades when you are done shaving. I still recommend this cream as it shaves and protects well.</li>
    <li> The shaving cream is for a relative for Christmas, but I am confident he will like it and order more in the future.</li>
    <li> great price for a great product</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream.  The smell, lathering, and moisture is top notch. Almost a tie with Truefitt and Hill.  I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Hate the smell. Smells like motor oil and a lime mixed together. The coconut cream in the tube is my preferred scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving cream itself is great... better than anything I&#x27;ve tried from competitors.  Lasts a long time and works great with the brush</li>
    <li> Scent is strong but not overpowering. Will linger a bit after a shave but won&#x27;t overshadow aftershaves or colognes. Lathers well and provides great cushion.</li>
    <li> I have about 15 shaving soaps and creams. This one gives a luxuriant lather, smells great and is easily my favorite. It is expensive but worth it. The amount in the tub is on the large size. Will try other Trumper creams.</li>
    <li> Gives a good lather, and leaves my skin looking healthy, but I would have preferred a slightly stronger scent. The lime scent from this is completely negligible once you lather/shave/clean-up. SLS free! Works well, but -1 for the price. For the cost of this you can get 2 tubes of Proraso that works just as well.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I was very disappointed thinking this would have a pleasant lime scent, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It shaved well but just could not stand the off lime/soapy scent.  I&#x27;m sorry to say that I dumped it down the drain but kept the container, it will make a good shaving bowl (I&#x27;m just being honest).</li>
    <li> No surprise that this is a wonderfully performing shave cream.  I had previously used Art of Shaving and that was my first experience with &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shave cream.  I decided to branch out and after much research, chose Trumpers.  I&#x27;d read their Limes was the main scent they were known for so that&#x27;s what I went with.  The scent is ok, but not great.  Not quite the old-fashioned, manly scent I was hoping for.  In any case, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger so that&#x27;s not a big deal.  And it doesn&#x27;t smell bad by any stretch...just not what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance:  superb.  On the first shave I added a bit too much water and the lather was very foamy.  On subsequent uses I&#x27;ve cut back the water and it gives an amazingly creamy, rich lather.  This is definitely an upgrade from Art of Shaving (which is no slouch itself).  You can&#x27;t be disappointed if you give this cream a try, but I&#x27;d consider a different scent...but that&#x27;s all up to personal taste.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much. It smells great (the wife agrees), it gives a great lather, and is probably going to last like the rest of my life. Seriously, I use the tiniest bit and can get enough lather to shave my face two or three times (takes a little practice). Great compliment to the Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Limes after shave.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this scent before - glad I made the switch. Been a Trumper&#x27;s fan for years and years. Nice rich later, great shaves!</li>
    <li> best shaving product in the world !!!!&lt;br /&gt;nothing comes close, close, close, close,.&lt;br /&gt;It is impossible to say anything better than I have already said!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried shaving creams from across a spectrum including other imported brands but have not found a product that provides the lather and closeness as Geo. F. Trumpet.</li>
    <li> this product was recommended by my brother. I have tried the coconut cream and was pleased. the scent was mild to moderate at best but didnt leave the skin with a extreme citrus scent. the cream lathered very easily and felt soft on the skin. The cream was non recactive with my skin. overall I am happy with this product and have no real complaints other than the price was alittle more than i wish to drop for cream.</li>
    <li> I love using a brush. I love the smell of the soap and the great shave. it&#x27;s one of my happy rituals. I detest the unshaven look and feel, so this is my gift to myself. A zen moment every day.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, lathers rapidly and smells great.  Lubrication is excellent with no razor drag.  Having used gel products in the past when comparing this shaving cream to those products I&#x27;d say there is no difference with respect to the razor drag issue.</li>
    <li> Jar was not full lager hole in the center of the jar.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for some time now and have tried a variety of shaving creams.  Geo. F. Trumpers is clearly the best I have come across.  The lather is just unbelievable -- soft and almost caressing.  The scent is also just great.  This is a little luxury that every man can afford, and no man should be without.</li>
    <li> After switching to double edged shaving three years ago, I know why the old English shaving cream companies have been around for so long.  I&#x27;ve had a ton of shaving creams, after shave balms, pre-shave oils, etc.  I have a pretty good idea what a decent product should look, smell, and feel like.  This cream is one of the best.  It is very moisturing, though not as moisturing as [[ASIN:B000IB0G8M Geo F. Trumper Coconut Oil Soft Shaving Cream 200 g cream]].  You almost do not need a pre-shave oil.  I use [[ASIN:B0007M3ZKI Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food, 100ml]] as both a pre-shave oil and aftershave (the label suggests using it for a pre-shave if you have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people don&#x27;t like this version of lime fragrance but it&#x27;s all subjective. I happen to love this lime fragrance.  It&#x27;s somewhat sweet but not overly so or too fragrant.  I&#x27;ve tried [[ASIN:B000KFYRX6 Truefitt &amp; Hill Shave Cream Tub - West Indies Lime]] and that is much sweeter and stronger smelling than this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cream for your shaving rotation.  Some other items in my shaving drawer you may like are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RGC1T0 Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Shaving Cream Travel Tube]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000IB0G8M Geo F. Trumper Coconut Oil Soft Shaving Cream 200 g cream]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RGC1R2 Truefitt &amp; Hill Grafton Shaving Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0077FYRNW Geo F. Trumper Spanish Leather Shaving Cream 75g shaving cream]]&lt;br /&gt;Kiehl&#x27;s Mens Alcohol-Free Herbal Toner 8.4 Oz.&lt;br /&gt;Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Pre-Shave Oil, 2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;Truefitt and Hill 1805 Aftershave Balmruefitt and Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm</li>
    <li> I have tried several different shaving creams and soaps and this one by far is the best. I always look forward to my time shaving and this product has added even for excitement to my daily routine. The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering at all and the lather, well,let me say that this stuff will lather for days. I normally do three passes and when I lathered this stuff up in my scuttle I could not believe the amount of lather I had. I could have done another three passes with what I had left. In fact it pained me to wash the remainder down the drain. Yes, this may be pricey, but it is well worth the money. It has now become my go to cream. I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other scents.</li>
    <li> smells very nice. Great shaving cream.</li>
