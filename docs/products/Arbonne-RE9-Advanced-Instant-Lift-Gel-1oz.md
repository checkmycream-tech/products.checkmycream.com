    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product (along with the whole \\&quot;RE\\&quot; kit) for about 3 yrs.  Some wrinkles that were starting, disappeared and haven&#x27;t reappeared!  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a couple of weeks but I can see the difference.  I&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  I will look into other product by this company.</li>
    <li> Great product...arrived quickly and intact.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have drooping eyelids. It&#x27;s the only thing that bothers me about my eyes, which is a big thing. This stuff is like magic in a tube. It keeps them lifted for about 5 hours. It&#x27;s not cheap but it will last you about a year!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 10 years. Use it just under the eyes in the a.m. over my powder. I&#x27;m 62 and it really tightens the skin under my eyes. Wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it !!!!! Amazing difference for me.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing, and really good for those days when you wake up, and think, \\&quot;Ugh, I need a little extra help this morning!\\&quot; It is instant, and gives great results!</li>

I am a 37 year old female who highly recommends this product, and I&#x27;m here to tell you, it&#x27;s WELL worth the money! Give it a try- I suggest trying the sample or travel size first if the price tag freaks you out. I can guarantee that once you see how this makes your skin feel, you will be ordering this product in it&#x27;s full size!</li>
    <li> I love this lift gel! I have worn contact lenses for years and this product helps with the lines and wrinkles from putting lenses in and taking them out!</li>
    <li> Love item thank you I can not find this type of lift in any other product would recommend this to other people</li>
    <li> This product is a go to product and one I will always have.  It smooths fine lines but does not leave the chalky white mask that many others leave.</li>
    <li> Its not sticky, or filmy, its also not effective. Did absolutely nothing when putting it on. Tried it for a few weeks. Nada.</li>

    <li> I like the product.&lt;br /&gt;My skins feels firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it every month and def recimended... It is def to use in special ocations, not every day , because its a little expensive... Def worth the money</li>
    <li> Great ! I love this for my wrinkles.  It also keeps my face smooth.  In addition it keeps my lipstick from bleeding in the crevices</li>
    <li> I have bought this product through an Arbonne dealer before and it worked much better. This product seemed thinner, almost watered down compared to what I bought before. Lesson learned...I will buy from Arbonne dealer next time.</li>
    <li> This seller ships quickly and delivers a high quality product, and at a fair price. There are cheeper products on the market, but none that have worked as well for me. Arbonne RE9 Advanced Instant Lift gel is highly recomended.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference once applied</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just too far gone but this product did not give the &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; results expected from reading the reviews, and, at a cost of $40 plus I anticipated better results.</li>
    <li> A Christmas Gift. However, the person who is being gifted loves this product! She tried it at a home demonstration and declared she had to have it!  So on Christmas Day, SURPRISE!!!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Arbonne products, but this is definitely one of my favorites.  I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  It is not at all greasy which is the complaint I have had with other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Arbonne products are the best face products that I have tried.  People can&#x27;t believe the difference in their skin when they try it!  I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it has so many ingredients that is benefical to your skin. It helps to tighten and prevent sagging and the gel is compatiable with my skin since I have oily skin problems. This doesnt clog my pores. I got this for a great price and the shipping was fast! I recommend this instant lift gel for the tightening and benefical ingredients for the face..</li>
    <li> This product is a must for women over forty. I&#x27;m still using it at sixty. This product really does what the product advertises.</li>
    <li> I love this product I just wish it was less expensive. I feel that my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for about 3 years now and love it.  It doesn&#x27;t cake up or get crusty when you where make-up over it.  I use it under my eyes for puffiness and people tell me I look like I got a good night&#x27;s sleep when I use it. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  will buy again from seller</li>
    <li> I did not like this product, it didn&#x27;t lift anything or make the puffiness under my eyes go away or even down a little. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Your skin feels tight but this product really does not do much as far as reducing wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It works great and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I really like this lilft Gel, at first I was spectical of its ability to make a difference but after using it for the first time I really did notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Finally.......a product that delivers!  I am 55 and have good skin, but this helps it look even better.  It truly tightens my skin and helps my powder foundation glide on easily.  Plus, I have no issue with breakouts while using this product.  This is my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; skin product.  Trust me.  After using multiple skin lifting/tightening products with little success, I am a big believer in this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, provides &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; as described; lightweight and easy to apply; believe it is a quality product for women who need a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I gave  four stars because their excellent customer service. As  to the product, I do fell the tightening sensation on my face after using  it, however, it is still too early to tell if it really works, if it has more lifting power than the egg white which is much more cheaper.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t at all meet up to what it claims. If you used it on just washed skin it would be okay. As soon as you add the serum it breaks down.</li>
    <li> I just started using this each day, and it may be my imagination,but I think that my skin is looking better and smoother. It has not caused any breakouts as of yet. I love Arbonne prod</li>
    <li> This serum changes the way my face looks and feels!  I can actually feel my skin getting tighter when I put it on.</li>
    <li> I do not want to run out of this skin product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product at a home party demo and the Rep had us use it on only 1/2 of our face. You could literally feel your face start to tighten and lift on the side that it was applied to. It was very cool. Cannot wait to get my own bottle. I have a toddler and my face could use a \\&quot;lift\\&quot; now and then.</li>
    <li> Arbonne has great skin products and I have used them for years.  I will order more soon because they make a difference. Janelle</li>
    <li> This is the product where a little dap at the eye corners and other problem wrinkle areas will take miles off your face.</li>
