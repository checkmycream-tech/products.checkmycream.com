      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it works good or not because i have not use it yet.  </li>
      <li>This was a product that had a good price for the amount.</li>
      <li>I could touch my leg and it felt fat, which is a good sign.</li>
      <li>really good product....</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still good for the price.</li>
      <li>Good product, good price.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t feel a thing is apply a good amount to the area where you will be getting inked.</li>
      <li>it does a good job on numbing the skin and after the 2 hour wait for numbing to start it</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t feel anything for a good 3 hours when I was getting tattooed.</li>
      <li>Cost wise, the two products were comparable.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m VERY satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>this stuff was amazing.  </li>
      <li>put it on and covered it and then kept it under the blanket to keep it warm.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s kind of like an ace wrap but disposable).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The both products worked effectively.  </li>
      <li>I basically rubbed in a good amount, then placed a think layer on top and covered with saran</li>
      <li>This product is very good and really works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting laser hair removal in a sensitive area and this stuff works EXCELLENT!  </li>
      <li>I doubt this would be that useful for a lengthy tattoo process, but it&#x27;s great for shorter procedures.</li>
      <li>It takes a while for it to take effect but it worked wonders while I was getting tattooed, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results of this product.</li>
      <li>My best advice is to wrap it tightly with saran wrap for two hours ahead of time with a good amount of cream .  </li>
      <li>it has more than 3 stars</li>
      <li>If you have alot more to go then reapply.</li>
      <li>I was able to use one tube for one leg and wrapped the leg in plastic wrap.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, I love to get tattoos, but not the toughest with the pain</li>
      <li>HEAT makes this work better and faster.</li>
      <li>i love tattoos</li>
      <li>I used this stuff again, and I was able to take another two hours.  </li>
      <li>and I was finally able to test this product yesterday when I did my 50% acid peel.</li>
      <li>This is why so many people don&#x27;t like to do business via the computer.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you follow the directions</li>
      <li>I was able to use one for both sessions.</li>
      <li>I think the most important thing to mention is that you HAVE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!</li>
      <li>Better than gel...</li>
      <li>I was better off taking ibuprofen.</li>
      <li>This was with 1.5 mm needles piercing my skin many thousands of times.</li>
      <li>I guess these products work better on some than on others...</li>
      <li>It helped take the edge off for sure, and gave my adrenaline time to kick in.</li>
      <li>It takes 45-60 minutes before it kicks in and the more you layer on, the longer it takes.</li>
      <li>even the ones that looked reputable</li>
      <li>This cream works better than the lidocaine cream that I&#x27;ve also tried.</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t be happier! :)</li>
      <li>So I think this stuff works fine if you use it correctly.</li>
      <li>The Super numbing cream was the lowest price on the internet and it sure did come in handy while I was doing a tattoo on my neighbors belly because without it the pain was too much to want to deal with.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipment and nicely packing.  </li>
      <li>I never thought I could do it, but now I have a totally smooth bikini line.</li>
      <li>This was the cheapest 5% lidocaine available on Amazon</li>
      <li>Amazing product for those tattoos in very sensitive areas just make sure you don&#x27;t miss an area because you can tell right away.</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>just have to make sure you put it on about 2 hours before you plan on getting  tattoo or using the derma roller but works pretty well.</li>
      <li>but nothing compared to the full pain of a tattoo.  </li>
      <li>tattoo sooth cost allot more so if you want an edge that wont cost so much</li>
      <li>you want to put this cream on and wait 2 FULL HRS before getting inked.</li>
      <li>and I had to work on the area quickly.  </li>
      <li>NOT even in 2 hours but lucky for me</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S PRETTY CHEAP</li>
      <li>Overall I was very pleased with this numbing cream.</li>
      <li>It completely numbs the skin and eliminates pain but make sure you use plastic cling wrap to prevent evaporation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this to work on my own ribs as well as my left arm.</li>
      <li>it does not numb AT ALL.</li>
      <li>Did not numb the pain.</li>
      <li>worked good, really helped for the first hour, however some potency was lost after thar, definitely start about two hours before your appointment</li>
      <li>The price was right, and figured to give it a try.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really help when the artist starting adding all the color, but I didnt feel the entire outline which lasted a good hour or more.</li>
      <li>Then I put on a pair of super sexy giant granny panties and popped in a movie.</li>
      <li>The spray seemed to have much less effect on her, so she pushed on through the 4 hour session, using the spray fairly often.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was very efficient and quick.</li>
      <li>i would say tattoo smooth is the best as it has a before numb and during tattoo.</li>
      <li>i personally do not recommend getting this product, the packaging is cheap and it also does not give accurate instructions.</li>
      <li>Make sure you cover the area completely, I missed a small area and found out how good this was working when the needle hit me.</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure i get the right one that actually would work</li>
      <li>This product generally seemed to work better for longer, but the gel certainly worked for up to maybe 90-120 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>RUB it in so it gets absorbed into the skin very well.</li>
      <li>At first it felt like it would do the job but didnt</li>
      <li>i followed the instructions EXACTLY.</li>
      <li>This does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>**) why not ;-)</li>
      <li>I made it through the first 2 rounds of coloring and shading before I started to feel the cream wearing off</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
      <li>Ok... so the product took a little while to get here, which was fine because I was informed about shipping times.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got for tattoo work on my foot.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and covered it and then kept it under the blanket to keep it warm. An hour later I got my tattoo and it definitely dulled the majority of the pain!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY SMALL TUBE AND EVEN THOUGH IT&#x27;S PRETTY CHEAP, YOU NEED ALMOST A WHOLE TUBE TO COVER A SMALL AREA THICKLY NOT TO MENTION THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME (OVER AN HOUR OR CLOSER TO TWO HOURS) AND YOU HAVE TO COVER IT WITH SARAN WRAP, WHAT A MESS!!!!!  IT DOES WORK AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE GETTING A SMALLER TATTO BUT NOT TO EPILATE YOUR ENTIRE LEGS!</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it is supposed to do. Just follow the instructions and it will provide all the relief you need.</li>
    <li> Ill keep this simple just doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t believe any positive review. I&#x27;ve used a lot of numbing creams and this cream is one of the worst ever</li>
    <li> really good product....I personally use it for my dermaroller. It takes an hour to numb my entire face, be sure to use the cling wrap after applying the product and wait for an hour or 2 till your body part is fully numb then rinse off completely.</li>
    <li> I would like to start off by saying that in order to get my area fully numb, I had to apply a generous amount, if not, it did not work properly. Here is what I have found out:  i had to cover area with a thick amount of cream in order to get the full numbing effect.  I had to wait at least 30 min. Until fully numb.  But, once the cream was wiped off, my numbing time was limited and I had to work on the area quickly.  I did find that if I applied a thin coat after use, it helped &amp;#34;take the edge&amp;#34; off the pain immediately following my procedure.  This is a great product.  I found that my work time in that specific area was about 10 - 15 minutes once cream was wiped off.  Overall I was very pleased with this numbing cream.</li>
    <li> worked good, really helped for the first hour, however some potency was lost after thar, definitely start about two hours before your appointment</li>
    <li> I have a full back piece that required 8 hours of pain.  I&#x27;m starting on a sleeve, but I&#x27;d heard that certain parts of your upper arm are really painful.  I decided to try this based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m VERY satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, I put on a thin layer, and then really caked it on two hours prior to my tattoo.  I then covered it with saran wrap.  When I got to the tattoo parlor, I took off the saran wrap and wiped it off.  Unfortunately it took about an hour before we actually started since he had to sketch out the piece and apply it to my arm.  Even so, when he was working on me, it felt like he was gently scratching my arm.  No joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I got a late start, I started feeling it around the 2-hour mark.  I definitely could&#x27;ve gone longer had he started sooner, so I would say it lasts 2.5-3 hours before it gets uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, I got ANOTHER piece on my upper arm right above my elbow (OUCH!).  Typically this isn&#x27;t recommended since the skin on your arm will be pretty angry from the first one.  I used this stuff again, and I was able to take another two hours.  They were slightly uncomfortable, but definitely NOT as bad as if I hadn&#x27;t used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, and one tube goes a LONG way.  I was able to use one for both sessions.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in using this product for laser hair removal. I was better off taking ibuprofen. Don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this when I get tattoo work done and it really seems to work well. Nothing takes all the pain away but this stuff does work</li>
    <li> I guess these products work better on some than on others...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I were both having some work done.  After the outline session, I decided to order some numbing cream since my wife was struggling with the large piece on her back.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice when I ordered this product that it was coming from Hong Kong, so it was taking longer than I expected to arrive.  A few days before our follow up session, I order another gel and spray product.  Both orders arrived on the same day, so I had a chance to compare both products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my session was first, I used the gel on the top half of my arm, and this product on the bottom half.  (I wanted to know which product would be best for my wife.)  Both use the same active ingredient, with the gel at 4% and the this product at 5%.  I had both on for around 90 minutes by the time we started.  (the gel says 1 hour, this product says 1-2 hours.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The both products worked effectively.  I had almost no feeling for around 60-90 minutes, and then started feel more, but it was certainly still less painful.  This product generally seemed to work better for longer, but the gel certainly worked for up to maybe 90-120 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the spray.  This seemed to help for maybe 30 minutes before the effect wore off, but no where near as well as the gel or cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used this product on my wife.  Maybe she has different skin or lower pain threshold, but it worked for maybe 60 minutes before she started to feel some mild pain.  After less than 2 hours, we needed to use the spray.  The spray seemed to have much less effect on her, so she pushed on through the 4 hour session, using the spray fairly often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We still have another session to finish off, so I will be ordering this product rather than the gel, and will try the gel once it wears off, since it says it can also be used during as well.  Cost wise, the two products were comparable.  Both products used about the same amount to cover, and we used two 10g tubes on my wife&#x27;s large back piece, and probably 10g on my large upper arm piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did this product work... yes.  Better than gel... yes.  Did it last 4 hour... no.  The spray... no where near it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and nicely packing.  Don&#x27;t know if it works good or not because i have not use it yet.  but it came with three little bottles.</li>
    <li> i was skeptical cause i&#x27;ve used a few other ones prior and even the ones that looked reputable [dr. numbs] didn&#x27;t work as well as this. but you HAVE to leave it on for at least an hour at max 2 and also you have to use saran wrap and wrap it up or it will not work as well. couldn&#x27;t be happier! :)</li>
    <li> It takes a while for it to take effect but it worked wonders while I was getting tattooed, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results of this product. It doesn&#x27;t last for a long time, maybe an hour or so if you don&#x27;t re-apply it, but it&#x27;s still good for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is very good and really works. Product is affective AA long AA you give it the 2 hours it needs to work</li>
    <li> I have bought numbing stuff before and wondered where I went wrong. This stuff works though. I applied this for about 1 1/2 hr and taped some cling film over the area, yes the area went numb. I was epilating below my belly button (no not my pubes, I haven&#x27;t mustered the guts as yet) but I have really thick hair. I had actually braced myself for the pain when I started, I could feel the epilator tug the hairs but I felt no pain. Be warned though, I had a very good idea of what I had missed when the product started wearing off!</li>
    <li> It doens&#x27;t numb the pain completely. You really need to give it 2 hours and then hopefully it lasts throughout your entire tattoo. As your skin starts to &amp;#34;wake up&amp;#34; it can hurt as you&#x27;re getting tattooed. I&#x27;d definitely order it again for the rest of my sleeve for the inner arm and wrist areas.</li>
    <li> I was going on a trip in a tiny bikini and needed to be truly smooth down there. I was TERRIFIED of waxing. The last time I attempted it I got 3 strips done, started crying so hard I had to abandon the project. I had written it off as something I would never ever ever do again until I saw some things about numbing creams. This was the cheapest 5% lidocaine available on Amazon so I decided to give it a shot. I used the WHOLE tube on my bikini line, slathering it on as thick as it would go. Then I took three pieces of saran wrap, 2 about 2&#x27; long and one about 1&#x27; long and covered the areas. It&#x27;s hard to THINK about, but really pretty straight forward to actually wrap it. Then I put on a pair of super sexy giant granny panties and popped in a movie. About an hour in I got really antsy and bored, so I tested an area with a pair of tweezers and it was already 100% numb, so I went ahead and started waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting SOMETHING to hurt, but all I felt was tugging. Weirdly the burning of the wax still hurt a lot, but the actual hair pulling did not. I managed to get through the whole thing very fast because there was no pausing for the pain to die down. It was very efficient and quick. After 30 minutes sensation did start to come back slowly, but I was like 95% done by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously this is the best thing EVER for anyone who waxes. I never thought I could do it, but now I have a totally smooth bikini line. Yay!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was going in for my second round of rib work; honestly, my pain tolerance was shot and I just knew I couldn&#x27;t finish the piece without some assistance so I decided to try a numbing cream. I think the most important thing to mention is that you HAVE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS! A majority of the negative reviews seem to be from people who didn&#x27;t put it on until 30 or 45 minutes before their procedure/tattoo. You need to put it on 2 hours prior for the full affect. I basically rubbed in a good amount, then placed a think layer on top and covered with saran wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this isn&#x27;t a miracle product. I made it through the first 2 rounds of coloring and shading before I started to feel the cream wearing off but I would still highly recommend it! Instead of sitting through one hour of sheer pain I sat through about 10-15 minutes of discomfort. Next time, I will re-apply a think layer before getting in the chair and see if that makes a difference. I will absolutely use this again and even gave my extra tubes to my brother for his sleeve.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen my share of con artist before but how stupid can a person be to still pull this with all the internet whistle blowing today. This is not 30 grams.  The manipulation of 3x10g.  They sent me 3 tubes of 10 grams each...Really, Really...Wow.  This is why so many people don&#x27;t like to do business via the computer.  Because of scum like this seller. Now it&#x27;s very clear to me who&#x27;s writing these review. As soon as my bad review can out approx. 10 new reviews praising the product came out to hide mine...lol and just for the customers that want to know how it works, I would never lie about a product.  I decided to try it and it NEVER numbed a thing.  NOT even in 2 hours but lucky for me I had a back up plan by the name of  Dr. Numb Maximum Topical Anesthetic Anorectal Cream and it worked great.</li>
    <li> I used it on my face before using a derma roiller 1.5 mm.  It completely numbed my face  You must apply liberally and cover with plastic wrap and ait at least 30 to 40 minutes.  There are no directions to tell you anything.</li>
    <li> i love tattoos but i am not a fan of the pain that comes with.  this stuff was amazing.  i barely felt anything at all.  maybe a slight burn or poke here and there but nothing compared to the full pain of a tattoo.  i will never get a tattoo with out this stuff again.  i&#x27;m excited to finally have a product help me get through my back piece.</li>
    <li> My order arrived well before expected.  Followed the directions and applied cream 2hours prior to my tattoo appointment and wrapped with saran wrap.  I&#x27;m in the process of working on a rather large back piece and I&#x27;m very happy that this product works well!  I would highly recommend this to anyone and I intend to order Super Numb again soon, thanks!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing, didn&#x27;t even take the edge off.  It literally did nothing but waste my money.  Don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
    <li> Super Numb worked as advertised. It completely numbs the skin and eliminates pain but make sure you use plastic cling wrap to prevent evaporation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just finished having a tattoo done on my shoulder using Super Numb. I have a very low threshold of pain when it comes to having tattoo&#x27;s done anywhere on my back so based on the reviews on here I thought I would give it a try. I did everything as instructed and I was fairly impressed. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to say I didn&#x27;t feel anything but it definitely took the sting out of it. It started to wear off after about an hour though which was a bit disappointing (I was hoping it was going to last 3 hours) and after a further 30 minutes it didn&#x27;t really have any effect at all. I would only recommend this for tattoos that are going to take 90 mins or so but I will definitely use it again. I am going to also try the spray in which you use DURING your tattoo after the skin has been broken and hopefully using the 2 of them together will help me through the rest of my back piece!</li>
    <li> Did not numb the pain. Not satisfied with this product at all. At first it felt like it would do the job but didnt</li>
    <li> I am using this gel for laser bikini treatments. It world well but it takes around 2 hours until you fill the numbing on applied area.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use on my feet to ease the pain of getting them tattooed. This cream is \\&quot;awesome\\&quot;!!!!!!!!!! I did not feel anything on my feet where the numbing cream had been placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this cream if you have any plans to tattoo your feet!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, It worked great and I didn&#x27;t really follow the directions. I had almost no pain durring my three hour tattoo session.</li>
    <li> This was a helpful product for me. I am getting laser hair removal and I am at the lasers max setting. I can still feel the laser a little but this really helped to dull the pain.</li>
    <li> I know there&#x27;s been a few mixed reviews on this one, but as far as most \\&quot;numbing\\&quot;/\\&quot;pre-deadedeners\\&quot; go I felt that if it didn&#x27;t work, at least I wasn&#x27;t out $40 plus bucks like some of the other products out there. I&#x27;ve been using this to work on my own ribs as well as my left arm. I followed the directions, saran-wrapped myself for 2 hours, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned it worked as promised. On my ribs (which aren&#x27;t the funnest place ever) I didn&#x27;t feel really anything for at least the first hour and a half. It helped take the edge off for sure, and gave my adrenaline time to kick in. As far as my arm....well that was numb for hours after I was done...almost to the point it was kind of annoying...LOL...I had NO problems with ink running, oozing, color not saturating properly, not healing correctly or anything of that nature either. (I use only Bloodline inks)I know everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to things, but again....I&#x27;ve had really good luck with stuff, and would definately recommend it at least to try. I&#x27;m a firm believer if you can make a client&#x27;s expereince a little bit more comfortable (and keep still a bit longer**) why not ;-) Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I bought this to numb my abdomen for a dermarolling treatment (for stretch marks.) I spread one whole 10 gram tube over the area, covered in plastic wrap, then let it sit for 2 hours. I felt nothing when performing the treatment except around the edges which apparently didn&#x27;t get enough cream. This was with 1.5 mm needles piercing my skin many thousands of times. So I think this stuff works fine if you use it correctly. Four stars because it did wear off after about 15 minutes (would be too short for some treatments) and I think it&#x27;s a rather expensive product, although similar in price to other products of the same type.</li>
    <li> So I got this specifically for waxing. I&#x27;m a 40 year old woman who has NEVER waxed before. I tried waxing one side of my bikini line and OMG I thought I was gonna die. Hurt so damn bad. I swore I&#x27;d never do it again and I was just supposed to be sasquatch down there. Super numb came today and I got up the courage to do the other side of my bikini line. THIS STUFF IS THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD. I will never wax w/o it again. Ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this stuff to get a fairly large cover up on my back, if the directions are followed properly, you literally do not feel a thing (for about the first two hours).  I am  a huge sissy when it comes to pain/ tattoos, but had to have the god awful mess of a tattoo covered up.  For the first two hours I literally felt nothing for about two solid hours, as the cream wore off a bit the pain never got as bad as it did with out the cream.  Was able to sit through a four hour tattoo with out flinching (completely relaxed other than the buzzing of the needle).  Will never get another one with out this stuff again.  If you don&#x27;t have to go through the pain, then don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and this will numb area very well. Amazing product for those tattoos in very sensitive areas just make sure you don&#x27;t miss an area because you can tell right away. I left the cream on for the 2 hours as directed and wrapped with saran wrap. Lasted about 3 hours from the time I wiped off the cream to start the tattoo. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I used this prior to laser hair removal in a painful area. It works well if you follow the instructions to the letter. I used a ton of cream, covered it in cling wrap, and let it sit for about an hour. It lasted during the entire session (about 10 minutes). I felt the effects start to wear off after another 10 minutes or so. I doubt this would be that useful for a lengthy tattoo process, but it&#x27;s great for shorter procedures. However, I find [[ASIN:B004FBKJJ2 Dr. Numb Cream - Topical Anesthetic 30g]] to be a better numbing cream, at least for laser hair removal.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help me with epilating because I couldn&#x27;t stand the pain and could only do sections of my legs at a time. I decided that I wanted to get it done all at once and started to look into topical numbing cream. This was a product that had a good price for the amount. I was able to use one tube for one leg and wrapped the leg in plastic wrap. I did have to wait for three hours instead of two to have it take affect. I could touch my leg and it felt fat, which is a good sign. I removed the plastic bit by bit and wiped off the remaining cream before epilating. I didn&#x27;t feel any pain what so ever! I could feel the hairs being ripped out but no pain! It was great! I was able to epilate my whole leg in half an hour once the cream started to work. I will buy this product again when I need to do another major epilating session.</li>
    <li> just have to make sure you put it on about 2 hours before you plan on getting  tattoo or using the derma roller but works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I gave this a shot and it worked. I used it to do use my MT roller for my face.  It deffinitely help with the discomfort levels!  I put the super numb only on one side of my face to compare and it really made a difference!! Worth it! I would recommend it. I did leave it on for about one hour and a half prior to using needle roller.</li>
    <li> Ok... so the product took a little while to get here, which was fine because I was informed about shipping times.  I ordered this because Dr Numb was much more expensive, if I was going to take a chance, I figure take a chance on a cheaper brand.  I read reviews on other brands and even those had negative comments stating it didn&#x27;t work, so there really isn&#x27;t one product you can truly trust unless you test it yourself.  When I received the package, it was shipped from Hong Kong... immediately I became even more skeptical... but like I said, I was going to take a chance and I did.  I rubbed a little bit on the inside part of my forearm where tattoos would primarily be more painful.  Wrapped it with a piece of saran wrap and wrapped that with a piece coban (it&#x27;s kind of like an ace wrap but disposable).  I let it sit for about an hour and a half.  Soon as I took it off, it felt tingly like how your cheek feels after the dentists.  I pinched it and sure enough, it was numb!!!  I&#x27;m like holy crap!!!  It lasted at least 3 hours from the time I checked.  I did this in the evening so because i fell asleep, I don&#x27;t know when it actually wore off.  So if you&#x27;re going to take a chance on these numbing creams... try this one, it&#x27;s much cheaper.  On a side note, I&#x27;m also a medic in the military and what I can tell you, especially if it didn&#x27;t work is that people react differently to numbing medications.  For instance, I&#x27;ve used lidocaine and xylocaine injections on people while I stitched some of them up, and it either numbed them really well, only slightly, or not at all.  It is rare, but that&#x27;s just how it is, or, you could have gotten a bad product.  I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend 30$ on a 30g cream that might not work... I figure 15$ for 30g was cheap enough, you can also get them for 10$ for a 10g cream I believe.  So if you can&#x27;t trust any of us... try it yourself.  That&#x27;s really the only way.</li>
    <li> If used as instructed this stuff really works , I only give it 4 stars because it doesnt last a horribly long time .  But I was getting tattooed on the inner arm and underneath and that is a sensitive area ....  DIDN&#x27;T FEEL A THING !  My best advice is to wrap it tightly with saran wrap for two hours ahead of time with a good amount of cream .  I think the trick to the best numbing is it being wrapped tightly and forced into the skin to absorb.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting laser hair removal in a sensitive area and this stuff works EXCELLENT!  I put it on 2 hours before my treatment and put plastic over the area, then wiped it off when I was about to go in.  I only put it on a tester area to see how it would work and when she got there, I didn&#x27;t feel a thing.  I was surprised.  I&#x27;ll definitely be using this every time I go in for a treatment.  It works wonders!</li>
    <li> I purchase this sometime ago and I was finally able to test this product yesterday when I did my 50% acid peel. Normally, put 50% acid peel on my face feel very uncomfortable, but using this cream made acid peel easy and painless and it continue working (numbs the area) for couple more hours before skin feels back to normal. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> ...You rub it in until it absorbs about 3X (over the entire area and a little bigger) where you plan to get inked...then put it on like cake frosting and wrap with plastic wrap at least two hours prior! Bring with you so the artist can reapply for larger/longer pieces as needed. Me and my boyfriend did this together and got inked at the same time (in two different, but painful spots) and we hardly felt anything. As it wears off (about 2 hours) you start to feel the burn and then eventually the pinch. If you have alot more to go then reapply. I was almost done so I did not find it necessary and it was still bearable. I had previously purchased a more expensive product and it was runny and did not last. Hope this helps peeps!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Numbed completely! Def buying more to finish my sleeve and any other tattoos in future. Remember wrap with pastic wrap. Been numb for 4 hours so far!!</li>
    <li> Truly numbs you for a brazilian i never feel a thing. Just the tugging of course but no pain when its left on for 2hrs.</li>
    <li> This cream works better than the lidocaine cream that I&#x27;ve also tried. If you follow the instructions and cover the area before numbing, it works well. I&#x27;ve used this for bikini laser surgery and all I felt was a few tingles. My only complaint is that it does take longer than 30 minutes to work. It takes 45-60 minutes before it kicks in and the more you layer on, the longer it takes.</li>
    <li> I realy like this cream it does a good job on numbing the skin and after the 2 hour wait for numbing to start it lasts up to 3 hours of tattoing</li>
    <li> Just follow the directions and it makes using the microneedle skin care kit incredibly less painful and thus, more effective.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and thought since they all were good Ill buy it... BIG MISTAKE! I put the cream on and it didnt numb AT ALL not even hours later! Don&#x27;t waste your monet! I would rate a 0 but i cant smh</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided on this cream.  I put it on 2 hours prior and 30 minutes prior and it does NOT work.  I have a high tolerance for pain too but this did nothing at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at a few products on amazon that would help me get through with my back tattoo. I wanted to make sure i get the right one that actually would work and i spotted Dr. Numb . The price of Dr. Numb is a bit expensive and it didn&#x27;t have too many positive feed backs , so i did further shopping. I ran into \\&quot; Super Numb\\&quot; product and was a bit skeptical to purchase because it only had 2 reviews and the box looks sketch. The price was right, and figured to give it a try. I applied a small amount to my arm to test it out with saran wrap over. After about 45 minutes of covering the cream , my arm was super numb.... I even pinched it my hardest and not felt one thing. Dragged a needle accross and still nothing... 2 hours and still numb. Amazing product!!!!</li>
    <li> this does numb area if applied heavy and coverd 2 hours than the numb wears out quickly. i cut thin plastic and expose a small area at a time. if you dont it will all loose numb affect before you do the out line. i would say tattoo smooth is the best as it has a before numb and during tattoo. tattoo sooth cost allot more so if you want an edge that wont cost so much dr numb is ok and it does a deep numb but is short lived, if you expose an area you can finish in 15 miniutes the expose next area it will do the task.</li>
    <li> One of my friends who&#x27;s a tattoo artist told me about this cream. I gave it a shot and I was amazed how great it worked. I couldn&#x27;t feel anything for a good 3 hours when I was getting tattooed. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use during epilation of underarms and legs. Was skeptical because of the product name (come on, Super Numb??), but since there was a decent number of reviews and I was able to find it under 15 bucks, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely numbed up my legs really well and reduced pain in my underarms by A LOT. Takes a little over an hour to work and lasts 30 minutes to an hour (for me). It says to use a thick layer, but I apply a thick, but transparent layer and it works fine for me. Just fyi- you need to cover it with saran wrap, so anticipate using this when you&#x27;re alone.</li>
    <li> Hey everyone i wanted to write a review of this product and tell everyone how to properly use it so you do NOT FEEL ANYTHING! I just got my ribs finished last night and anyone who has there ribcage tattooed knows it is one of if not the most painful places to get inked. This product eliminated ALL pain for 3 hrs and i will never get another numbing cream but this stuff. What you want to do to get this to work so you don&#x27;t feel a thing is apply a good amount to the area where you will be getting inked. RUB it in so it gets absorbed into the skin very well. THEN load the area with a THICK coating like you are frosting a cake. once you have a nice thick white coating on the area have someone TIGHTLY wrap you with clear saran wrap. once you are wrapped up tightly put on a compression shirt (under armor or any of the other brands). HEAT makes this work better and faster. Then i put a heating pad on my side for about an hr then a HR with it off. you want to put this cream on and wait 2 FULL HRS before getting inked. You have to give it the time so it completely numbs the area. After the 2 hrs is up take off the wrap and have your tattoo artist wipe it off and begin with the tattoo. you will not feel a thing!!! This stuff works wonders just follow my directions and you will never feel a thing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I love to get tattoos, but not the toughest with the pain but with this stuff u dont feel a thing. Only thing I would suggest is that u rub a lite amount over the area then put it on heave over the area and make sure u rap it tightly with sranrap, and wait atleast an hour befor u wipe it off.</li>
    <li> I have a giant tattoo that goes all the way up my side, and I used this for the occasion. It didn&#x27;t really help when the artist starting adding all the color, but I didnt feel the entire outline which lasted a good hour or more. This stuff really helped me get through a painful process.</li>
    <li> So I had seen negatives reviews but decided to give it a try, and it did work i put it on and put the plastic wrap, after like an hour i noticed it was numb i couldnt feel it.</li>
    <li> Following the advice of another reviewer, I put this on 2 hours before my appointment and covered it with plastic wrap. Just before going in, I took off the wrap and rubbed in the remaining cream. This stuff is not greasy at all, and my tattoo came out great. I got a large piece on my ribs, and I was completely pain free for over 2 hours. All I felt was the pressure from the gun, but NO PAIN at all. Make sure you cover the area completely, I missed a small area and found out how good this was working when the needle hit me. I didn&#x27;t tell the artist that I had put anything on, he couldn&#x27;t believe how well I sat through a ribcage tattoo. I HIGHLY recommend Super Numb and will always use it on the rest of my tattoos.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t last much longer than 30 min but it helped get through a horrible area to get tattooed, it was worth the few bucks</li>
    <li> When I got this I read the instructions. I then places a big glob in a 3&#x27; circle and left it to sit for nearly an hour. I tested that area in different ways and saw little to NO effects compared to other skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still going to use it when I get my tattoo. I have several tattoos and I&#x27;ll let you know if I feel like there is any effect. PLEASE, remember that just because I don&#x27;t see it working for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you. I&#x27;m 50 and my skin may not absorb it like younger people.&lt;br /&gt;Denille</li>
    <li> I had several skin tags that I needed to remove. I had I tried numerous other mothods (wart remover, tying string (or hair) around it, tea tree oil, etc) and nothing had worked. This time I followed the directions - applied a thick coating and covered (I used a knee and elbow band-aid which has tape on all 4 sides - instead of saran-wrap) it for two hours. I used a very sharp pair of scissors (per my dermtologist) and in one snip - they were gone! And the best part was that I didn&#x27;t feel A THING!! The area stayed numb for a while, so there wasn&#x27;t even any soreness aftewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this out, I can see how it would be a piece of cake to get a tatoo! Just make sure you follow the directions and you will feel no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> i am VERY disappointed with this product. it has more than 3 stars and i read the reviews and decided to give it a shot. it does not numb AT ALL. i purchased this numbing cream because i was planning on getting a finger tattoo and ive heard its really painful there. i followed the instructions EXACTLY. my finger didn&#x27;t numb at all, i then decided to try it again the next day and there was no change. i personally do not recommend getting this product, the packaging is cheap and it also does not give accurate instructions.</li>
    <li> The Super numbing cream was the lowest price on the internet and it sure did come in handy while I was doing a tattoo on my neighbors belly because without it the pain was too much to want to deal with.  I definetly recommend it, the cream makes it so that you cant feel anything.</li>
