      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts since using this product.</li>

      <li>Great, nice color too</li>
      <li>Loved it...</li>
      <li>I really loved my Physicians formula organic tinted moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>just loved it...</li>
      <li>Good stuff...wish there was a darker shade...</li>
      <li>However, I was lucky because this shade is perfect for my tanned skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product, it&#x27;s lightweight and makes for a nice smooth appearance.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of ruddy</li>
      <li>It honestly burns my eyes.</li>
      <li>Product is nice consistency.</li>
      <li>Very nice and light going on.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to blend over face and doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;fakey tan\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I wanted a more warm &amp;#34;peachy&amp;#34; color, this was NOT it.</li>
      <li>My pictures came out glowing, bright and natural, but my skin is not that great...</li>
      <li>What surprised me was the very pleasant smell--almost like lavender.</li>
      <li>Nice for a light coverage.</li>
      <li>This is an even better product than the Organic Wear CC Cream from Physician Formula.</li>
      <li>Its my favorite moisturizer</li>
      <li>am extremely pleased with this product</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>On top of that, in this multicultural age, how can their darkest color be so light?</li>
      <li>As a product marketed as &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, it smells strongly of chemicals which does not make a lot of sense.</li>
      <li>Strong alcohol smell?</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t sink in fine lines.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not too light.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re all light:</li>
      <li>This is cruelty free and organic.  </li>
      <li>it seemed good and natural..</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover my skin too much so the effect is very natural and the color is very nice.</li>
      <li>I live in a warm, sunny climate</li>
      <li>and I most certainly repurchase it once I run out of this one or once my tan fades and I&#x27;ll need a lighter shade.</li>
      <li>In fact, this consistency is much lighter and my skin tolerates it better.</li>
      <li>Once you start applying it, you have to work quickly because it seizes up in about 10-15 seconds.</li>
      <li>Looks fine over physical sunscreen (which often has a white cast), and the color I ordered, Natural/Tan, works great for my olive, easily tanned skin.</li>
      <li>As I get older a lighter touch of &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; seems to look much better and more natural on me.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to find a few tubes on Amazon as I can no longer buy it at the store.</li>
      <li>Made my skin sooo soft, and luminous, when I wore it, I got many compliments on my skin and make up.</li>
      <li>A nice basic organic tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Just enough tint to even out redness and covers nicely.</li>
      <li>The product starts out very watery, so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally over-use the first couple times.  </li>
      <li>Color is vibrant and smooth.</li>
      <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need very much to cover the whole face, which is nice because the bottle is not particularly big.</li>
      <li>Love this tinted moisturizer and use it in place of regular foundation.  </li>
      <li>I got the light to natural and it was a beige color.</li>
      <li>Feels natural, just better Highly recommend for my sensitive skin peers!</li>
      <li>a bit...Smells a bit like lavender, has lavender oil in it and very cooling on the skin.</li>
      <li>This is not really a cover up, more of a moisturizer with a tad bit of tinting.</li>
      <li>Shade is a bit unclear on and it does not appear to moisturize my skin very well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it is really smoothing.</li>
      <li>The size is also very convenient, to stash it the purse.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really provide any coverage.</li>
      <li>I much preferred Burt&#x27;s Bees and Beauty without Cruelty versions but can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore.</li>
      <li>It is nice to have the bit of tinted color in this as well because it evens out your skin tone without feeling heavy.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t generally need much, and usually am great with the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer, but this is so liquidy and is worse than even a normal face cream.</li>
      <li>I have loved this product since the company first introduced it, but unfortunately they have discontinued it.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve never been a big fun when it comes to use foundation or stuff like that..</li>
      <li>wow...</li>
      <li>I bought the Natural to Tan shade, but it is a shade lighter than my complexion.</li>
      <li>I wear it instead of foundation for a natural glow.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised....</li>
      <li>I have the lighter shade for winter months and the tanner one for summer - both blend very well and last all day.</li>
      <li>I love this product because I don&#x27;t want to wear a thick foundation every day.  </li>
      <li>and I planned on diluting it with the other, lighter-colored CC cream I have from PF, but the product ended up being very, very light even in the its darkest shade, and I only have a little bit of tan.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s not high coverage, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be.</li>

<li> I like the feeling because it isn&#x27;t too heavy on the skin</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy.</li>
<li> It is also really thin and runny with really poor coverage as a tinted product and the thin quality makes it a less than useful moisturizer.</li>
<li> /&gt;Another downside is that it comes in very few shades</li>
<li> I have thrown it away as it is too late to return under Amazon policy.</li>
<li> I never liked the feeling on my face.</li>
<li> If you have a darker complexion you might not find a shade for you (at least not on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> Its thin, not cakey, and I get compliments on my complection when I wear it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very nice and light going on.  Nice for a light coverage.</li>
    <li> Love this tinted moisturizer and use it in place of regular foundation.  As I get older a lighter touch of &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; seems to look much better and more natural on me.  And this is soooo cooling when it touches your skin ... yum.</li>
    <li> I really loved my Physicians formula organic tinted moisturizer with sunscreen. Just enough tint to even out redness and covers nicely. I like knowing it is organic and rates well on EWG and Think Dirty sites/apps. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have loved this product since the company first introduced it, but unfortunately they have discontinued it. I was happy to find a few tubes on Amazon as I can no longer buy it at the store. I am going to contact Physicians Formula and ask them what I should us as an alternative.</li>
    <li> I have used this product almost everyday since it arrived. I bought the Natural to Tan shade, but it is a shade lighter than my complexion.However, I apply the tinted moisturizer with my fingers or a brush, and it blends perfectly into my skin. The moisturizer does not leave my face feeling weighed down or greasy. The fact that the moisturizer contains sunblock is a plus. I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts since using this product.This is a great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like paint thinner. It honestly burns my eyes. I&#x27;m not a fan</li>
    <li> Product is nice consistency. Color is vibrant and smooth. Would def. buy again. Very easy to blend over face and doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;fakey tan\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Shade is a bit unclear on and it does not appear to moisturize my skin very well.</li>
    <li> I wish I found and used this earlier! I just bought it from my neighborhood, drug store, to try it out. But after I used this, I was like...whaaaaat...??? Sooo Gooood??? I was surprised....a bit...Smells a bit like lavender, has lavender oil in it and very cooling on the skin. Made my skin sooo soft, and luminous, when I wore it, I got many compliments on my skin and make up. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it is really smoothing. The coverage is very sheer, so I wore a bit concealer and a little face powder. My pictures came out glowing, bright and natural, but my skin is not that great...lol...wow...The size is also very convenient, to stash it the purse. Loved it...just loved it...</li>
    <li> this is the only foundation I use and have been using it for several years so when my locals store stopped carrying this, I order it here now.  A little goes a long way.  Even if I fall asleep before I take my makeup off, i never have to worry about breakouts. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Good stuff...wish there was a darker shade...I biught bb cream and it is too thick...hope they don&#x27;t stop making.</li>
    <li> The tint is a bit lighter than I expected - I&#x27;m not dark-skinned by any means, so I chose the second-to-darkest color.  I&#x27;m kind of ruddy I guess and it made my skin pale and flat looking.  Now I mix it with a bit of lotion so it&#x27;s not too light.  I&#x27;ll keep it but won&#x27;t buy it again.  I much preferred Burt&#x27;s Bees and Beauty without Cruelty versions but can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore.</li>
    <li> I did NOT like this product. It smells weird, and it is super runny. Felt oily on my skin. I got the light to natural and it was a beige color. I wanted a more warm &amp;#34;peachy&amp;#34; color, this was NOT it. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Stays on all day.  Makes a great base for my mineral make up or wear it by itself with a little blush.  Evens out skin tone.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is cruelty free and organic.  Feels great on my skin.  I wear it instead of foundation for a natural glow.  It covers well.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really provide any coverage. I don&#x27;t generally need much, and usually am great with the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer, but this is so liquidy and is worse than even a normal face cream. On top of that, in this multicultural age, how can their darkest color be so light?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my makeup foundation for years. It moisturizes, has sunscreen, and smoothes out my complexion before putting on my powder.</li>
    <li> Very good coverage without being gloppy.  Goes on smoothly.  I have the lighter shade for winter months and the tanner one for summer - both blend very well and last all day.</li>
    <li> As soon as I put it on, my face looked 100% smoother and nicer. It blends in with my skin tone and stays on all day without getting shiny. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product because I don&#x27;t want to wear a thick foundation every day.  I live in a warm, sunny climate and I appreciate the sunscreen factor in this moisturizer.  It is nice to have the bit of tinted color in this as well because it evens out your skin tone without feeling heavy.  The product starts out very watery, so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally over-use the first couple times.  Once you start applying it, you have to work quickly because it seizes up in about 10-15 seconds.</li>
    <li> Strong alcohol smell?</li>
    <li> This is not really a cover up, more of a moisturizer with a tad bit of tinting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product, it&#x27;s lightweight and makes for a nice smooth appearance.  I&#x27;m all about organics and I also like that it has a sunscreen in it as well.  My face stays moisturized all day as I have a tendency towards dry skin although this is not oily to me.</li>
    <li> This is an even better product than the Organic Wear CC Cream from Physician Formula. In fact, this consistency is much lighter and my skin tolerates it better. The only downside is that it is extremely liquid, therefore it can result in a messy application if you use your fingers to apply it. Sometimes I end up with the product dripping down my wrist. In order to avoid such problem, I apply teeny tiny drops of product on my hand and pat them on the different areas of the face, instead of taking a bigger amount at once.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is very low, so don&#x27;t expect this tinted moisturizer to replace your foundation: it will just even out your complexion, moisturize it, and leave it brighter and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;Another downside is that it comes in very few shades and they&#x27;re all light: I purchased the darkest color because I am tanned and I planned on diluting it with the other, lighter-colored CC cream I have from PF, but the product ended up being very, very light even in the its darkest shade, and I only have a little bit of tan. However, I was lucky because this shade is perfect for my tanned skin. If you have a darker complexion you might not find a shade for you (at least not on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this product and I most certainly repurchase it once I run out of this one or once my tan fades and I&#x27;ll need a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two years. It&#x27;s lightweight, yet provides coverage. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy. Doesn&#x27;t sink in fine lines. Feels natural, just better Highly recommend for my sensitive skin peers!</li>
    <li> Great, nice color too</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. It was very fair (and did not match my skin tone well). I also didn&#x27;t like the smell or the texture. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> A nice basic organic tinted moisturizer. I got this for my pregnancy as I don&#x27;t want to be wearing makeup with lots of chemicals in it. It&#x27;s not high coverage, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be. What surprised me was the very pleasant smell--almost like lavender. It smells very good; even my husband commented on it. Looks fine over physical sunscreen (which often has a white cast), and the color I ordered, Natural/Tan, works great for my olive, easily tanned skin. I have yellow undertones and this product matches them well. It&#x27;s a little watery, so shake it up before using. Also, you don&#x27;t need very much to cover the whole face, which is nice because the bottle is not particularly big.</li>
    <li> As a product marketed as &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, it smells strongly of chemicals which does not make a lot of sense. It is also really thin and runny with really poor coverage as a tinted product and the thin quality makes it a less than useful moisturizer. I have thrown it away as it is too late to return under Amazon policy.</li>
    <li> Its thin, not cakey, and I get compliments on my complection when I wear it. Its my favorite moisturizer and I don&#x27;t need foundation because its tinted.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve never been a big fun when it comes to use foundation or stuff like that.. I never liked the feeling on my face. But I wanted to try this one &#x27;cause it seemed good and natural.. and well..I love it!! It doesn&#x27;t cover my skin too much so the effect is very natural and the color is very nice. I like the feeling because it isn&#x27;t too heavy on the skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it.. so it feels like you don&#x27;t have anything. I also like that has SPF15 so even better!!</li>
