      <li>maybe it&#x27;s just me, but they are so cute in the bottle..</li>
      <li>I really like them all 3 colors they are very cute &amp;&amp;</li>
      <li>, believe its not DBP/Toulene free.</li>
      <li>Have used it several times and everyone that sees it thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>These are super pretty and they go on nicely.</li>
      <li>But, the pink is great.</li>
      <li>It went on easily but really didn&#x27;t cover evenly.</li>
      <li>They are sooooo pretty!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll have fun using it for &#x27;play&#x27; makeup.</li>
      <li>neon sparkly pink polish is not as bright as pictured, nor does it have as much glitter, but the bottle was completely full.</li>
      <li>The very sweet pink is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It looks nice after three coats, but they took forever to dry.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and looks nice, but it&#x27;s rough (even after a clear topcoat)</li>
      <li>Can use it alone or over so many different colors.</li>
      <li>and I have no problems keeping my nails pretty.</li>
      <li>These are pretty....</li>
      <li>if layred over top of a coat of deep blue polish  reminds me of a night sky and is my favorite one at this very moment.</li>
      <li>oh and the smell really IS terrible..but goes away once dry :)</li>
      <li>Other stores have started carrying new confetti glitter polishes that work great and they cost the same amount.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you REALLY gotta work to get an even coverage of glitter</li>
      <li>very difficult&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love pink</li>
      <li>(more of a reddish color with glitter- center bottle on the</li>
      <li>pic)&lt;br /&gt;These polishes are adorable in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The one with the tiny hearts is so cute, but i have tiny nails and after spending about 10 minutes to actually get a heart on the brush</li>
      <li>Even though the smell is horrible and very very strong, I still gave these polishes a 5 star because they look great, go on smooth, came/shipped VERY fast, and the seller was quick to get back to me with the questions that I had.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying many other colors to add to my collection.</li>
      <li>The bottle was only 2/3 full, too.</li>
      <li>Baby love (the one with the tiny hearts- left in the pic)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>/&gt;The darker, sparkly pink looks exactly as pictured, but the bottle was about 3/4 full.</li>
      <li>the hearts take a bit to work with but are very cute once you get them on :) the pink polish has a translucent pink tone to the polish itself and then has strips of glitter and little crescent moons in it..</li>
      <li>clear polish with hearts has much, much fewer pieces of confetti in it than the picture shows.</li>
      <li>The colors are pretty and similar to that on the picture.</li>
      <li>(right in the pic) has different sizes of glitter and silver stars, I am yet to get the larger glitter or even a star on the brush..</li>
      <li>it was kinda large and didn&#x27;t lay flat on my nails..</li>
      <li>they are a little harder to work with then your every day glitter polishes but the patience pays off :)</li>
      <li>They go on easy over other colors and last a long!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too bad because this is the one I was most excited about.&lt;br</li>
      <li>polish goes on smooth though and isn&#x27;t thick or gooey so multiple coats to get a glittery look is possible..but</li>
      <li>Pink Soiree (pink with glitter- right in the</li>
      <li>Comes on too thick and gloppy and is mainly just clear polish and barely any sequins/ glitter.</li>

<li> Not worth your money.</li>
<li> They are average size, not trial size.</li>
<li> The nail polish is gooey and it&#x27;s hard to get the hearts or speckles on the nail; it takes several coats to get the hearts, and by then the polish is too thick.</li>
<li> was disappointed as the other 2 reviews were positive..</li>
<li> But it is so hard to get the glitter on my nails.</li>
<li> The consistency is just too thick.  </li>
<li> but they don&#x27;t go on thick, so don&#x27;t expect that.</li>
<li> Its almost frustrating.</li>
<li> in the bottle, the smell is a bit weird</li>
<li> I even tried the trick of putting my hands in freezing cold water to speed up the drying process, but it didn&#x27;t work on this polish.</li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s impossible</li>
<li> This set contained: (as named on the bottles)&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
<li> /&gt;It is very difficult to get the glitter and hearts on the brushes!</li>

    <li> I ended up buying about 12 of these, in different colors. I&#x27;m very pleased. They are average size, not trial size. Great quality and super cute.</li>
    <li> This set contained: (as named on the bottles)&lt;br /&gt;1) Baby love (the one with the tiny hearts- left in the pic)&lt;br /&gt;2) Pink Soiree (pink with glitter- right in the pic)&lt;br /&gt;3) Pink &amp; Co (more of a reddish color with glitter- center bottle on the pic)&lt;br /&gt;These polishes are adorable in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The one with the tiny hearts is so cute, but i have tiny nails and after spending about 10 minutes to actually get a heart on the brush it was kinda large and didn&#x27;t lay flat on my nails..but that&#x27;s just my nails..they may go on properly on larger nails.&lt;br /&gt;It is very difficult to get the glitter and hearts on the brushes! The Pink &amp; Co. (right in the pic) has different sizes of glitter and silver stars, I am yet to get the larger glitter or even a star on the brush.. I think it&#x27;s impossible&lt;br /&gt;The polish goes on smooth though and isn&#x27;t thick or gooey so multiple coats to get a glittery look is possible..but very difficult&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed as the other 2 reviews were positive..but I personally cannot get the glitter! maybe it&#x27;s just me, but they are so cute in the bottle..if only I could get that look on my nails..oh and the smell really IS terrible..but goes away once dry :)</li>
    <li> I love these polishes! They are sooooo pretty! Even though the smell is horrible and very very strong, I still gave these polishes a 5 star because they look great, go on smooth, came/shipped VERY fast, and the seller was quick to get back to me with the questions that I had. I would recommend this to anyone (who wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell)!</li>
    <li> Love the color and the detail. However, it is way too difficult for you to make sure the &amp;#34;design&amp;#34; is even with the hearts/sprinkles/glitter.</li>
    <li> Not worth your money. I used it and it chipped the next day i used it. I would not recommend it</li>
    <li> Love it.  Can use it alone or over so many different colors.Have used it several times and everyone that sees it thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> These are pretty....in the bottle, the smell is a bit weird and you REALLY gotta work to get an even coverage of glitter, believe its not DBP/Toulene free.</li>
    <li> Consistency is great, colors are really cute and the pinky moon if layred over top of a coat of deep blue polish  reminds me of a night sky and is my favorite one at this very moment. The smell is ok and doesnt bother my asthma, I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;Wanda</li>

    <li> the glitter in these isnt good it takes a ton of coats to get the amount of glitter you want and then you have a ton of extra polish on your nail.</li>
    <li> cute polishes but they don&#x27;t go on thick, so don&#x27;t expect that. the hearts take a bit to work with but are very cute once you get them on :) the pink polish has a translucent pink tone to the polish itself and then has strips of glitter and little crescent moons in it..the red polish has little circles in it...they are a little harder to work with then your every day glitter polishes but the patience pays off :)</li>

    <li> Nice colors. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty and similar to that on the picture. But it is so hard to get the glitter on my nails. Its almost frustrating.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself, but I&#x27;m going to pass it onto my girls. They&#x27;ll have fun using it for &#x27;play&#x27; makeup. The concept is so fun, but unfortunately, the nail polish doesn&#x27;t live up to the excitement. I&#x27;d skip it and buy some Wet &amp; Wild nail polish. Other stores have started carrying new confetti glitter polishes that work great and they cost the same amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The darker, sparkly pink looks exactly as pictured, but the bottle was about 3/4 full. It goes on easily and looks nice, but it&#x27;s rough (even after a clear topcoat) so your nails will catch on things (such as a sweater, blanket, etc) and chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear polish with hearts has much, much fewer pieces of confetti in it than the picture shows. The hearts are fairly large and hard to get on the brush, let alone on the nail. I have long nails, but the hearts won&#x27;t lay flat on them. The bottle was only 2/3 full, too. It&#x27;s too bad because this is the one I was most excited about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neon sparkly pink polish is not as bright as pictured, nor does it have as much glitter, but the bottle was completely full.

I even tried the trick of putting my hands in freezing cold water to speed up the drying process, but it didn&#x27;t work on this polish.</li>
    <li> My nieces and I love, love, love these polishes!!! They go on easy over other colors and last a long! I work with my hands daily and I have no problems keeping my nails pretty.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t quite cover as ou would think from looking on the bottle.  It went on easily but really didn&#x27;t cover evenly.</li>
