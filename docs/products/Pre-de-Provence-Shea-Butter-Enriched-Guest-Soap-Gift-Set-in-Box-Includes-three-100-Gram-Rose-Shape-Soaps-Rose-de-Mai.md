      <li>But, it is very pleasant while using, and my whole bathroom smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it smells wonderful and makes me feel soft.</li>
      <li>The wax paper package is nice with its muted label colors that are a much more faded then the bar pictured.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK if it&#x27;s not; the soap can stand on its own merits:</li>
      <li>This soap is very good quality, like the soap I have used in Europe, which is superior to our big name brands.</li>
      <li>Great rose scent and gentle on the skin.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not give it to her as a gift.</li>
      <li>I love this soap-</li>
      <li>Came packaged in a lovely floral paper.</li>
      <li>looks ok,  haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
      <li>The smell is overwhelming and if you have a sensitivity to scents, you might not want to purchase this soap bar.</li>
      <li>I am really pleased by this.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Lathers ok and washes ok.</li>
      <li>However, I do love it.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>soap has such a wonderful scent, I didn&#x27;t even want to use it, but just keep it to scent my lingerie drawer.</li>
      <li>I love the richness of the lather and the way it softens the skin.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>We will be purchasing more of this stuff in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don</li>
      <li>The fragrance is much milder now, but still very nice.</li>
      <li>Overall, a beautiful bar of soap that rose lovers would be pleased to use.</li>
      <li>This is a quality rose scent but nothing special.  </li>
      <li>When we first opened the box, the rose scent was really, really strong!</li>
      <li>But it lasts for more than a month, and the fragrance is pleasant and natural.</li>
      <li>Fantastic, richly scented soap that lathers very well and feels very nice.</li>
      <li>This soap has a powerful rose-petal scent, more fitting for the lady of the house than the man.  </li>
      <li>It is a strong value.  </li>
      <li>This soap has a mild rose scent, not overpoweringly sweet.</li>
      <li>Just as advertised, it produces a nice creamy lather (at least with our source of water) and it&#x27;s very pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good product; I just wish I knew a little more about what goes into the mill</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good product; I just wish I knew a little more about what goes into the mill (</li>
      <li>It is a huge soap bar</li>
      <li>My daughters keep it locked away like kryptonite because of the smell but enjoy using it otherwise.</li>
      <li>was also gratified to find that it is free from animal testing; an important element in any product we use in our household.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s attractive enough to use as a decoration.</li>
      <li>This is a gift quality bar of soap that smells fabulous.  </li>
      <li>A lovely soap, softly scented with rose fragrance.</li>
      <li>It lathers well and rinses clean with no film, just a light odor of roses.  </li>
      <li>A rich smell (Notez bien: do not purchase if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents or don&#x27;t adore roses), beautifully presented inside and out, and, a hundred petals or not, it really is from France.</li>
      <li>Lathers well and the amount of fragrance is perfect, not overwhelming but noticeable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just barely detectable if I give myself a good sniff and think about it.</li>
      <li>Rose de Mai French milled soap is an exceptional product which is very fragrant and provides a silky smooth feeling to the skin when used.</li>
      <li>Skin feels refreshed, toned, enriched creamy and clean, after use.</li>
      <li>The bar is strongly aromatic (but not overpowering), and the scent of fresh flowers lingers in your bathroom for hours after showering.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s also a relatively inexpensive way to give yourself a pleasant moment every day.</li>
      <li>I also love soap that lathers, and this one does very well.  </li>
      <li>I moved the bar into the living/dining area which is much more open with more air circulation, and after a day the scent had dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Truly mild and fragrant bar soap, for those preferring a bar to a liquid, try this it is bathing experience.</li>
      <li>Also does not disappear quickly -</li>
      <li>There are other rose soaps I think are better.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance, rich lather!</li>
    <li> I enjoy Pre de Provence bar soaps and I found this soap on their personal site. There isn&#x27;t much a scent but their soaps help to mositurize your skin after bathing and I haven&#x27;t had any conflicts since purchasing in 2013</li>
    <li> Rose de Mai French milled soap is an exceptional product which is very fragrant and provides a silky smooth feeling to the skin when used. I was most impressed with the scent which was so evident in the package when it arrived! The fragrance is intoxicating and truly reminds you of a flower garden in the spring. The scent remained in the bubble envelope for quite a long time. When the soap is used, the fragrance permeates the bathroom and leaves a fresh spring feeling. This soap is perfect in a guest bathroom or for anyone who loves roses. It is an ideal soap to use to help relax and feel you are transported into another place and time where everything stands still.  The soap is made from vegetable products and of a perfect variety of rose blends. Also it is very reassuring to know there are no harsh chemicals such as parabens, alcohol, phenoxyethanol and DEA and best of all there is *no* animal testing. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]</li>
    <li> OMGOSH is this fragrant! We cut up our bars because we like them to look pretty as long as possible. Even cut into quarters this bar packs a wallop! Our guest bath is at the end of a hallway and you can smell it a bedroom away. Lathers ok and washes ok. We like it.</li>
    <li> This soap has a mild rose scent, not overpoweringly sweet. With a disclaimer. When we first opened the box, the rose scent was really, really strong! My wife almost couldn&#x27;t stand to walk into the bathroom. I moved the bar into the living/dining area which is much more open with more air circulation, and after a day the scent had dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, we really like this soap. After washing and rinsing your hands there&#x27;s only a mild rose scent on your hands. We will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This smells so nice.  I give it four stars because it&#x27;s kinda pricy for a bar of soap, but clearly I think it&#x27;s worth the price. Don&#x27;t freak out when you get some of the dried roses on you or they get stuck in your poof. (:</li>
    <li> This a nice,creamy moisturizing soap with a good rose fragrance.  From the description of &amp;#34;rose de mai&amp;#34; I expected a very special rose scent.  This is a quality rose scent but nothing special.  There are other rose soaps I think are better.  However, this soap is nice and gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, using one of my favorite moisturizers, shea butter.  Shea is well known for its moisturizing and anti-aging effects.</li>
    <li> This soap has a lovely fragrance - like the old farmhouse rosebush that blooms in June at my mother&#x27;s house. All of the  Pre de Provence soap soaps that I&#x27;ve tried have been high-quality, and they are long-lasting if kept out of water when not in use. Really nice soap is more expensive than the drugstore type, no question. But it&#x27;s also a relatively inexpensive way to give yourself a pleasant moment every day. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> The smell is overwhelming and if you have a sensitivity to scents, you might not want to purchase this soap bar. However, I do love it. The scent reminds me of my childhood where my mom would keep potpourri around in all the rooms and would put spices and natural oils in a pan on the stove oven to make the house smell fresh during the coldest of winters. This way also put moisture back into the closed up house where the heat would run nearly non-stop. The soap itself leave my hands soft and the dried out feeling you get after using other soaps doesn&#x27;t happen. I am really pleased by this. It is a huge soap bar and I don&#x27;t expect I will run out for months, since I am keeping it by my bowl in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a huge bar of soap with a pleasant smell, nostalgic-making even, and beautifully packaged so that it would be perfect as a gift.</li>
    <li> When it came to high end soaps, my previous favorite was Baxter of California&#x27;s &amp;#34;Italian Lime and Pomegranate&amp;#34; scent, which for some reason keeps not being available through Amazon for long periods. While it was recently gone from the site&#x27;s catalog I decided to pick up this Rose de Mai soap bar instead and I&#x27;m very glad I did! The bar is strongly aromatic (but not overpowering), and the scent of fresh flowers lingers in your bathroom for hours after showering. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this one again in the future.</li>
    <li> This soap has a powerful rose-petal scent, more fitting for the lady of the house than the man.  It lathers well and does not break down when exposed to water.</li>
    <li> I thought of using this bar of soap as a sachet or a room freshener but the sample I received has almost no scent.  I must have received an older bar.  The wax paper package is nice with its muted label colors that are a much more faded then the bar pictured.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s attractive enough to use as a decoration. The bar itself is dark pink with dark spots and is dense and maybe a little harder than most soaps. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> When I think of rose scented soap, I think of my grandma and the rose scents she used to have. This soap is much better the rose scent is subtle along with other scents. It smells great and feels rich and luxurious. The shea and essential oils in the quad milled soap create a rich lather and a luxurious bathing experience. This is wonderful soap.</li>
    <li> My wife liked this soap in that it cleaned her hands and seemed destined to last a long time.  The scent was pleasant and she was pleased it would not function as a perfume for her body - she has another favorite perfume - but, for her, the scent would not have been a selling point.  Thus she would recommend this soap to those who want what it offers, but it is not really for her.  I&#x27;m glad I did not give it to her as a gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one that takes well to rose fragrances, but this particular scent is absolutely intoxicating. I cannot express well enough just how much I like the scent. As for the soap, it is made by Pre de Provence, the same company that makes some of my favorite shave soaps and after shave balms. Knowing the brand so well, I had high expectations for this bar of body soap, and I can say without a doubt that it lives up to the fine reputation it&#x27;s earned with me. The soap is quad-milled and creates a smooth, creamy lather that is top-notch. In hard water the lather isn&#x27;t quite as rich, but it is still much nicer than the typical run of the mill drugstore brand soaps. This soap rinses well without leaving any sticky feeling, and leaves the skin soft and moisturized with no need for lotion afterwards.</li>
    <li> The scent is very strong and the ingredients list is way too long for my comfort zone.  Why would anyone put preservatives in soap?  Are there bacon bits in it?  It should be self preserving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses are that it makes my bathroom smell like a garden, and helps cover other odors.  It also takes very little to lather, and after one week of use, I expect this one bar will last me at least 4 months through daily face and hand washes.  It does not overdry like cheaper soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it?  Yes.  It is a strong value.  I would not use it for infants and young children due to the ingredients, but it should be fine for adults who are not looking for an all natural soap.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that soap isn&#x27;t something I get really excited about, but this Pre de Provence Rose de Mai soap is really nice. I put it in my stall shower and was really amazed at how fragrant it was - and very pleasantly so. I&#x27;m not a fan of perfumey products, but this soap has a much softer and more natural scent than many others I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and the bar is still pretty substantial - not much shrinkage. The fragrance is much milder now, but still very nice. I love the richness of the lather and the way it softens the skin. As others have mentioned, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on the skin, but the softness lingers. If you feel like pampering yourself or your guests a bit, this is a nice way to do it!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Great rose scent and gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soap, unique in that it actually has flakes of petals embedded throughout the actual soap bar. In the beginning the smell of roses was obvious, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, the smell is not as strong. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve gotten used to it or the fragrance diminishes over time. As far as effectiveness in cleansing and hydration, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference one way or another compared to my regular soap, Dove Exfoliating Bar. The thing I will say is that Dove soap is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried that does NOT leave a super dry feeling on my skin (sort of like lots of friction) right after washing off. Pre de Provence Soap is like all the other soaps - it left that weird dry feeling that I&#x27;m used to with non-Dove soaps. But that&#x27;s just right after washing soap off. The feeling does not remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an expensive bar! But it lasts for more than a month, and the fragrance is pleasant and natural.</li>
    <li> Pale pink and full of dried petals - this bar smells like old fashioned roses!  The scent was evident before I even opened the package it arrived in.  The bar is large and should last a good while if I make sure to take it out of the shower and let it dry between uses.  It has a very nice lather and fills the bathroom with scent...whether you are using it or not.  Having such a strong scent, you would expect that it would leave you smelling like roses as well, but the smell dissipates fast from your skin.  Overall, a beautiful bar of soap that rose lovers would be pleased to use.</li>
    <li> This is a gift quality bar of soap that smells fabulous.  Alternatively, it looks and smells great at home in my own bathroom.  The scent does fill my small, ok, teeny bathroom, so it may not be good for those who are sensitive to smells.  I use it to wash my hands and it does a good job without drying my hands out.  It also stays firm and doesn&#x27;t get squishy after use.  I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This soap is one of the best I have EVER used.  When you open the box, before you see anything, the aroma already gave it away. The bar is just the right size for handling. It lathers very well with enough sod to clean but never leaving your skin feeling dry. Skin feels refreshed, toned, enriched creamy and clean, after use. The rich rose scent lasts a very long time after use. The are plenty of visible rose leaves in the soap you know you are using nothing but the best.  Great for alll seasons. Just started using this. My previous experience with organic soap this size, it lasts about 2 weeks with daily use, for 1-2 persons, on average. Enjoy, you will LUV it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, richly scented soap that lathers very well and feels very nice. I did find that the bathroom tended to keep the smell around, which is fine for us, but might be a bit much for a small bathroom or if folks don&#x27;t love the rich rose scent of this soap.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of roses.... and the scent of this soap did not disappoint.  I also love soap that lathers, and this one does very well.  My only critique is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last terribly long on my actual body.... and the bar itself is rather small.... but other than that, it&#x27;s great!!!  :)</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no doubt that this is a luxury soap with a price to match. It&#x27;s beautifully made, has a wonderful scent, and comes in elegant packaging. Just as advertised, it produces a nice creamy lather (at least with our source of water) and it&#x27;s very pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that this is best as a gift. It isn&#x27;t really the sort of thing for everyday use unless you have a rather big soap budget. This product plays to upscale tastes, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but it&#x27;s simply too expensive for ordinary, common family use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars for quality. One star off because it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my skin. Does not dry my skin but also rinses well.The rose scent is discernible and lingering which is what I was looking for. Amazon beats the price of the previous source vendor.</li>
    <li> Nice smell! Leaves skin soft! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Truly mild and fragrant bar soap, for those preferring a bar to a liquid, try this it is bathing experience.</li>
    <li> looks ok,  haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
    <li> This soap gets a mixed review in my house. It&#x27;s a nice sized bar, about 4 inches long, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be melting away as quickly as other specialty soaps I&#x27;ve tried. I like the rose scent, my daughters think it&#x27;s overpowering and keep the bar in a baggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a nicely textured, foamy lather. I thought it left my skin feeling coated with something - not exactly sticky but not clean. My daughters say the soap leaves their skin feeling soft. There&#x27;s no noticeable lingering scent after using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - I&#x27;m happy having it sitting in my bathroom, perfuming the air but hate using it. My daughters keep it locked away like kryptonite because of the smell but enjoy using it otherwise.</li>
    <li> This is a big slab of rose-scented soap. It lathers up nicely, helped by the little exfoliating bits embedded in the bar. The fragrance is very nice. It doesn&#x27;t remain on my skin, much. It&#x27;s just barely detectable if I give myself a good sniff and think about it. ;) But, it is very pleasant while using, and my whole bathroom smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blocky shape wasn&#x27;t the most comfortable, and I wasn&#x27;t all that fond of the plastic packaging either, but those are pretty minor complaints. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for rose-scented bath soap.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s some copy writer they hired over at European Soaps, LLC:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;May in Provence, that special time of year when Rose de Mai blooms for five weeks only.... Each bloom is hand-picked early morning, ...placed into the harvest basket...captures the essence of its hundred, fragrant petals...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, let&#x27;s assume that all of the above is true.  It&#x27;s OK if it&#x27;s not; the soap can stand on its own merits: A rich smell (Notez bien: do not purchase if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents or don&#x27;t adore roses), beautifully presented inside and out, and, a hundred petals or not, it really is from France. It&#x27;s quad-milled too, which means that the ingredients are mixed around four separate times, resulting in less water and a longer-lasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you may wonder why this doesn&#x27;t receive the coveted 5-star rating, the consumer products equivalent of the Palme D&#x27;or.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the ingredients.  As you know, soap is a product of saponification, the mixture of a fat or oil with an alkali salt.  We can expect, therefore, that some sort of salt will be present (lye, for example, is an alkali salt).  However, there are many, many other chemicals to select from the (complete) ingredient list, not all of which sound so Gallic-ly romantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These include:&lt;br /&gt;*Cl 73360 (D &amp;C red 30 lake), Cl 17200 (D&amp;C red 33 al lake).&lt;br /&gt;(Whoa, the color is apparently not completely from les roses de Mai...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also Sodium chloride, tetra-sodium etidronate, sodium hydroxide, tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate (must be the salts).&lt;br /&gt;Also, benzyl alcohol, amyl cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, methyl 2-octynoate hydroxyisohexyl, 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, alpha isomethyl ionone, hexyl cinnamal, butyphenyl methylpropional, benzyl benzoate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good-sounding stuff:&lt;br /&gt;rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, helianthuus annuus (sunflower) seed oil,  botanical rose blend (rosa damascena flower wax &amp; rosa centifolia flower wax), butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter extract, rosa damascena (rose) flower extract, aqua (water), parfum (fragrance).  And also...over 15 other ingredients including palm acid, glycerin, EDTA, citronellol, geraniol, benzyl salicylate, linalool, hydroxycityronellal, eugenol, citral, limonene, anise alcohol, cinnamal, benzyl cinnamate, coumarin, amy cinnamal, farnesol,and  isoeugenol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not gonna go all flouride on you.  All of these may be completely natural, found in les jardins de Provence or on the stairwell of Le Tour Eiffel.  I&#x27;m not a chemist (apparently a requirement for really knowing your soaps), and it may be that a lot of these ingredients are pretty standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s a question of aesthetics.  They want to emphasize the hundred, fragrant petals; but I also see an ingredient list that reads like an order for Chem. 101.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine, at least, tells you where the ingredients come from.  Now, all of this may be completely irrelevant.  It&#x27;s a very good product; I just wish I knew a little more about what goes into the mill (x 4).ena (rose) flower extract, aqua (water), parfum (fragrance).

    <li> I love this soap-it smells wonderful and makes me feel soft. Will continue to use it for as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this soap and I must admit that I am rather fond of it too.  The scent of rose is one of my favorites and this largish bar delivers.  Note that when you first use this soap the scent is quite strong but is quickly sort of gears down and becomes quite pleasing after just a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is both an excellent hand soap and bath soap.  The smoothness of the lather it creates is a wonderful feeling and it leaves you with that well washed feeling after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also gratified to find that it is free from animal testing; an important element in any product we use in our household.  I was also gratified to see that the price here is quite reasonable for what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most definitely classify this as luxury soap; and I should add that it is a luxury soap that is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither my wife nor I have any complaints as to this soap what so ever and in fact recommend this highly.  We will be purchasing more of this stuff in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
    <li> This bar of soap is seriously fragrant and actually smells like roses.  No sense of artificial aroma at all.  The whole shower area smells like there is a fresh bouquet. It lathers well and rinses clean with no film, just a light odor of roses.  A good choice for the ladies in the family, I think... assuming they like the smell of roses.  Definitely worth a try!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay</li>
    <li> This is a terrific soap.  The smell is wonderful.  While it&#x27;s floral, it&#x27;s not overly feminine, so guys can use it too.  It&#x27;s a good-sized bar, so it should last a bit longer than some.  There is a texture to this soap similar to strawberry seeds which may assist in exfoliating and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding soap.  5 stars!</li>
    <li> I usually have a list of pros and cons when I review a product, but this time there are no cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has such a wonderful scent, I didn&#x27;t even want to use it, but just keep it to scent my lingerie drawer. Each time I smell it, it reminds me of being in the middle of a wonderful rose garden! This soap is very good quality, like the soap I have used in Europe, which is superior to our big name brands. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I got this to use in the kitchen for hand washing.  It has a wonderful scent, very strong - I&#x27;m in the dining room as I write this, and I can smell the rose scent of the soap even from here. It makes a nice lather, too, very thick with lots of little dense bubbles.  Also does not disappear quickly - we&#x27;ve been using this every day and the corners are barely rounded, I expect it will last a good long  time.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> A lovely soap, softly scented with rose fragrance. Came packaged in a lovely floral paper. Nice size. Lathers well and the amount of fragrance is perfect, not overwhelming but noticeable.</li>
