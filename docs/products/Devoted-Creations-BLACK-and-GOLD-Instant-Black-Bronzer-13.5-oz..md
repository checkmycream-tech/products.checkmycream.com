      <li>Doing good job on tan but may switch back to LUMINARY after this bottle is done.</li>
      <li>After buying the sample for $12 at the salon I had to buy the full product.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the real deal!!  </li>
      <li>Water is not the first ingredient!  </li>

      <li>Did not bronze as much as the packet I bought in stores of the same product .</li>
      <li>Totally impressed I already had a base tan ....</li>
      <li>Leaves my hands a little yellow if you don&#x27;t wipe them off, but overall I love it.</li>
      <li>I am Mexican/Filipino and it is hard for me to find a lotion that will give me a significant tan from a tanning salon.</li>
      <li>I compared it to the packets a previously bought and it feels and smells exactly the same.</li>
      <li>you normally  get with other tanning lotions.</li>

<li> Everyone thinks I spent the $120.00.</li>
<li> Be careful and rub in well</li>
<li> Other than that I like the lotion.</li>
<li> My skin looked like I have been tanning at least weekly to keep a good base.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how dark this will get me.  </li>
<li> , I MIX IT WITH MY TINGLE LOTION, IM DARK DARK DARK</li>
<li> and i got so dark !</li>
<li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the fact that the lotion its self is so thick its hard to rub on</li>
<li> I am obsessed with this lotion and took a complete gamble by ordering off amazon.</li>
<li> The inside of my hands are VERY DARK!</li>
<li> I achieved a noticeable deeper/richer tan within two sessions as opposed to the usual  3-4 sessions.</li>
<li> UNBELIEVABLE BRONZER</li>
<li> /&gt;Before trying this product I usually put on whatever lotion I had.</li>
<li> After tanning, plan on waiting to shower for at least 5 hours, since it is a delayed bronzer.</li>
<li> Are they serious?</li>
<li> Fake fake fake !!</li>
<li> It does make you darker but Its not what everyone bragged about, it also leaves a terrible smell</li>

    <li> Best lotion in the world. I&#x27;m an avid tanner, and also bright pale white. Swedish. This helps me get very brown and never burn. Best lotion</li>
    <li> I liked this lotion it gives nice dark and even color. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the fact that the lotion its self is so thick its hard to rub on like I feel like I&#x27;m giving myself a deep tissue massage trying to get even coverage. But over all a great lotion.</li>
    <li> Good color, bad after tan smell!  Not awful but a little &amp;#34;cooked&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves my hands a little yellow if you don&#x27;t wipe them off, but overall I love it.</li>
    <li> Wow talk about giving you a nice color!!! Totally impressed I already had a base tan .... Tanned twice with this and got lots of compliments ! Def takes you to the next level!! Highly recommend !! Smell is good too!!! Nothing too fruity or prefumy just a nice smell</li>
    <li> Saved over 80%. Sells in my salon for $120.00 plus tax!!! Are they serious? Love the bottle. Everyone thinks I spent the $120.00. I get a kick out of that. Ofcourse the salon mgr. was not too pleased...but I wispered where I got it and what I paid.(around $35.00).</li>
    <li> UNBELIEVABLE BRONZER, I MIX IT WITH MY TINGLE LOTION, IM DARK DARK DARK</li>
    <li> Did not bronze as much as the packet I bought in stores of the same product . Do not use it.</li>
    <li> It is a very good price and  it worked without the orange streaks you normally  get with other tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> It does make you darker but Its not what everyone bragged about, it also leaves a terrible smell I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion starting off this tanning season. I so far have been for 5 sessions and have gained GREAT color with this lotion. I must say it is a DELAYED BRONZER!!!! YOU MUST Wash your hands ASAP or use a wipe after applying. The inside of my hands are VERY DARK! LOL (oops) After tanning, plan on waiting to shower for at least 5 hours, since it is a delayed bronzer. Other than that I like the lotion. Great smell as well. :)</li>
    <li> Good lotion. No tingle.  Be careful and rub in well or you will get streaks, but if applied properly you can get a deeper bronze tan. Definitely cheaper here than at my salon who sells it for 100.00.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this lotion and took a complete gamble by ordering off amazon. However, It is real and I am so happy I got it for such a cheap price. I compared it to the packets a previously bought and it feels and smells exactly the same. YAY!</li>
    <li> Perfect lotion! Came in quick too! Very satisfied!! I will recommend this product...u won&#x27;t regret it at all its awesome!!</li>
    <li> With lots of self tanners, a great scent and a soft feel, this is one of my favorite tanning lotions!! The best part is even with all the self tanners, you&#x27;re still streak free after</li>
    <li> Tan starts showing after only a coupke sessions. I like it.  Doing good job on tan but may switch back to LUMINARY after this bottle is done.</li>
    <li> This is the upper end tanning lotion, but I really didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference between the cheaper versions.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was exactly what was pictured. Will definitely purchase again when it&#x27;s time to replenish.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this several times. Price is killer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING.  I haven&#x27;t been tanning as much as I should have,  Its Feb and I think sometime in DEC was my last session so i was pretty faded out.  I bought this lotion used it, tanned once and holy whaaa.  My skin looked like I have been tanning at least weekly to keep a good base.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how dark this will get me.  And it smells soooooo goooood.  I wanted to eat it haha!  Try it for yourself.  I had no problems with streaking or oompa loompa stains.  So far my new favorite lotion.  And I try a lot!  It will take a lot to beat this one.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted at a great price</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning lotion!  Gives you a gorgeous dark bronze and lotion smells good too!  Loving it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion! You can tell a difference in just one use!!</li>
    <li> Fake fake fake !! Do not buy !!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product at the tanning salon before I bought this and it has not disappointed me. I will continue to buy this procuct.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! The price is amazing too!</li>
    <li> Thank you! After buying the sample for $12 at the salon I had to buy the full product.

    <li> Great product loved it</li>
    <li> awesome!  i love this lotion. goes on smoothly and has great instant color after tanning :) highly recommended . smells good too</li>
    <li> I love it! I am Mexican/Filipino and it is hard for me to find a lotion that will give me a significant tan from a tanning salon. I use a level 5 max at 12 mins and can use 1 time for a even 3 shades darker each time. Love the tingly feeling too!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal!!  Water is not the first ingredient!  Salon Quality Great Price!!  So Happy!!&lt;br /&gt;After one use I am much darker!!</li>
    <li> Worked good and fast....I just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of the self tanners!! Even after i showered at night the next morning I still had that &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell on me.....I would purchase it for the amazon price at $35.but WOULD NOT for the tanning bed price which was 65 and up....</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I am fair skinned and have been tanning for about a month now. I used this lotion for the first time today and wow what amazing color!</li>
