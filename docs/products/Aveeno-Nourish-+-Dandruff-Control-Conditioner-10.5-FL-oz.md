    <li> This shampoo really works and no more flaking!</li>
    <li> Son can only use this conditioner to stop dandruff. Thanks for such a good product.</li>
    <li> Cleans away any dandruff and leaves hair silky and shiney.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I prefer something w/moisture for my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected in this little bottle!! I am so please with this product, my scalp is dandruff free at the moment and the itch is gone. Not to mention the wonderful smell I will definitely keep a bottle of this handy!!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this. It works great for color treated hair and will stop flakes!!! I use it with Regis tea tree shampoo (I have never tried Aveeno shampoo). I hope Aveeno Dandruff Conditioner never gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> I checked all the ingredients before I bought this shampoo and thought it looked safe. Not! Almost immediately after washing my hair with it I started itching. By the next morning I was in full-scale allergic reaction mode and had to wash my hair again, but this time with good old Head and Shoulders. Now it&#x27;ll take me a couple of days for the allergic scalp rash to dissipate while I dose myself with Benadryl and repeated sprays of vinegar-water solution. What a disaster! Also the smell, which seems harmless enough at first, becomes overpowering even after rinsing - could be it&#x27;s the fragrance ingredients that I reacted to. And to add insult to injury, my hair looked like straw after only one wash. No, I definitely do not recommend!</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff but due to the many hair products I use my scalp&lt;br /&gt;was becoming itchy.  I had read in a magazine that this product would help with that&lt;br /&gt;and the article was correct.  Since I have started using this shampoo and con-&lt;br /&gt;ditioner the itching has almost totally disappeared.</li>
    <li> Have used this only a few times so far but like the results.  Leave my hair soft and manageable and smelling good, and controls the dandruff.</li>
    <li> the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended it to several of my friends!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to try new Aveeno products.</li>
    <li> My hair feels better using this product.  Delivery was quick and there were no problems.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great if you have dandruff.  It also has conditioner in it so it feels soft after washing and you don&#x27;t have to use another conditioner.  And, it styles better.  I have psoriasis and was hoping it would help with that as well as I can&#x27;t&#x27; use a prescription shampoo with Zinc in it.  It helped &amp;#34;a bit&amp;#34; but I am finding that nothing is helping the itching I have in my scalp.  I got this product for my friend, though, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> really like this product.  Rich and makes a nice lather.</li>
    <li> Great hair this stuff is great keeps my hair flake free clean and not drying like head &amp; shoulders.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and not being able to find it locally, I was more then satisfied to be able to find it on Amazon.  It arrived at a decen time and was wrapped well enough that it did not leak and arrived in great condition...thanks</li>

    <li> This is the first dandruff shampoo and conditioner I have been able to use that 1) Worked for my very sensitive scalp AND 2) Made my hair feel and look great.  My scalp is extremely sensitive to most hair products.  Most products cause my scalp to itch to point I get little red bumps that bleed or dry my scalp to point it creates dandruff.  I have used many products (very high end salon products, health food store products and retail shelf products) and have thrown many away as well.  This is the very first one that I like everything about.  Now that I have found something that works, I am afraid they will either change the formula or stop making it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and I still have dandruff along with an itchy scalp. At times it seems my dandruff has even gotten worse! The only plus is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my red hair color.  But I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo ever! leaves my hair clean, and manageable and dandruff free. The local stores do not carry this particular product and the others are too harsh for my scalp. so I order via Amazon. This is perfect for my semi-curly hair and the feeling after washing is amazing. Just perfect for me. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this for her allergies, and it works great.</li>
    <li> I just love this conditioner.I love their shampoo too! Helps a lot with my eczema problems.Basia K</li>
