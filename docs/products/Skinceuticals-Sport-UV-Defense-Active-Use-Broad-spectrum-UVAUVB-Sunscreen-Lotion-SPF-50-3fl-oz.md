<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Good protection for hours on end. protects even in most intense sun. Price has come down since I last bought it in 2012.</li>
    <li> Purchased to protect a healing scar from skin cancer removal.  Rather small tube for use over the whole body.  Would be very expensive for general use.  Otherwise a great quality product.  I like that the zinc oxide disappears shortly after application.</li>
    <li> It is the most good sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever seen. I have acne-prone face.   I could not find any pimple on my face since I used it.     But there are two things to tell.   One thing is my face turns to midly white when I put on the cream.    But If I spread more, it&#x27;s not a problem.    Second one is this has only UVA++ not UVA+++.</li>
    <li> This sunblock is wonderful.  It was recommended by my dermatologist 2 years ago and the price is much better on this websit then through the doctor&#x27;s office.  I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great, have sensitive skin &amp; eyes. Doesn&#x27;t burm @ all &amp; protects,  purchased it through amazon 2 save $$ &amp; not go through the docs off.  Big savings!!!!</li>
    <li> I usually break out with other sunscreens but this one is great and I don&#x27;t have breakouts.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Now that the weather is warming up, I wanted a really good UVA/UVB sunblock to prevent age spots, wrinkles, and sun damage. This is a thick, full coverage product that completely covers your skin. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face, neck and hands every day for several weeks and am satisfied that it&#x27;s protecting my skin from the sun without clogging pores or causing other skin issues. It does have a slight white tint, so I mix in a little bit of foundation when I put it on my face and that works very well.</li>
    <li> The product arrive on time and in perfect condition.  It is my favorite sun tan lotion.</li>
    <li> Best, most effective sun lotion.  Goes on easy, lasts for hours with the best protection.  I can golf for 5 hours, sit out in the sun for hours or walk outside for hours and never get burned- barely any color.  It helps to be diligent to reapply and wear a hat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn sunscreen religiously for many years, but recently had to give up wearing any that contain avobenzone, which is common in over the counter sunblocks. I can&#x27;t even have it on my face without my eyes burning, and if any gets into my eyes they get red and irritated immediately.  So, after reading reviews, I decided to try this zinc oxide based Skinceuticals cream instead.   The good news is, it&#x27;s much less irritating to the eyes than other creams I&#x27;ve tried. It does have a fairly thick consistency and leaves a whitish film when first applied, but absorbs fairly well after about half an hour.   My problem with this product is that after wearing it about a week, I noticed an increase in whiteheads - the type that form under the skin and can&#x27;t be gotten rid of easily. Worse than that, my skin began to flake and peel. After 3 weeks of applying it daily, I am giving up on it - the flaking and peeling have become really severe.   From the other reviews, it appears that most people tolerate Skinceuticals well, but if you have sensitive skin that breaks out easily this may not be the best choice for you.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, no smell, works well for oily skin</li>
    <li> I use this every day and even in the winter, and have been for years.  It works well alone or with makeup.</li>
    <li> In the past I used all name brand products but continued to break out in a rash and hives.  My dermatologist suggested skinceuticals sport sunscreen. What a relief, now I can enjoy my vacation without be miserable.  If you have sensitive skin, skinceuticals is a must.</li>
    <li> The only sunscreen I use.  Will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> This product is NOT suitable if you have acne prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be non-comedogenic and I ended up having 2-3 big pimples develop within 2 days of using it along with rashes on either side of my cheeks. Do check the ingredients if you have sensitive skin before buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I have very sensitive facial skin that breaks out with other sunscreen products.  I have never had a problem with this product.  It works well under makeup.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wrong description. This item does NOT contain zinc like the sport 45 did. In my opinion the sport 45 was a better product but has been discontinued by Skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> Beware, many of the reviews posted here are for a now discontinued product, SkinCeuticals Sport UV Defense SPF 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used and loved SkinCeuticals Sport UV Defense SPF 45 daily for many years.  This new replacement product fails on many points-poor, thin feel and coverage, yucky taste, on several occasions I was sunburned and my melasma is worsening again since I switched over to the new product.  I only wish I had read the reviews at SkinCeuticals&#x27; website before purchasing!  Would definitely not recommend this to anyone.  Has anyone found a good replacement yet??</li>
    <li> Stuff works great, and does not affect my sensitive skin. Really nice to not have it irritate the skin around my eyes!</li>
    <li> The old version - the SPF45 -  was great and I used to rate it at five stars. I&#x27;ve tried many sunblocks and this was by far the best. Did not run when it got wet or when you sweat, and a little went a long way.&lt;br /&gt;As of this year (2014) they don&#x27;t make that anymore and have a new SPF50 Sport Sunblock instead. It&#x27;s really disappointing. Goes on greasy (the SPF45 did not go on greasy!) and worst of all - it RUNS EASILY when you sweat. Hello irritated red eyes.  Major bummer. I&#x27;m now looking for another sunblock...</li>
    <li> I began using this product several years ago on the recommendation of a skin specialist.  I had very dark melasma/hyperpigmentation on both cheeks. Being allergic to hydroquinone it was recommended that I use the skin ceutical products.  The first thing I liked about this product is that it was easily absorbed, unlike other sunscreens that are too thick or remain white on the skin.  My mature skin loves the moisturing effect and now years later there is very little evidence of the melasma. I usually have to point it out to people. To some the price of this product may seem a little extravagant but a little goes a long way. Depending on your usage this tube can last a few months.</li>
    <li> we live in west africa, so in the sun daily. This stuff is really great, it&#x27;s a LITTLE heavy but not too bad, especially considering how well it stays on (I use it every day -- once it soaks into my skin, the oily look goes away completely) and it is WAY better than the skinceuticals daily defense 30, which leaves my skin weirdly white-looking and is somehow heavier. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for three years. Also, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, which I\\&quot;m a bit prone to lately.</li>
    <li> I am shocked that where I put sunblock I got burned and so my daughter. I used This product few years back and worked wonders, maybe formula changed.</li>
    <li> I did not like the new formula of skinceuticals Sport Defense, I asked for the old formula Defense and i received the new one that does not spread, we satay all white.  Did not like them.</li>
    <li> Really nice upgrade to the Skinceuticals line.  Much lighter and less greasy than the 45, but even more affective!  Meets new go ernment standards for UBA and UVB protection.  I&#x27;m definitely in!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best but expensive.  Works great and feels great on the skin compared with other sunscreens.  I like that it is uses all natural zinc oxide instead of a load of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great product time and time again.</li>
    <li> I have used the Skinceuticals sunscreen for years and it&#x27;s a great product.  My husband now also uses it daily.  The shipment was received within 55 to 6 days after placing my order.  I love dealing with Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using the SPF 45 Sport Sheer for years. OTA advertised this product as the replacement for the SPF 45. In fact, it leaves a white film on your face, and is not sheer. Skinceuticals says this is not the replacement product, but would not replace it because it was purchased from OTA. OTA would not refund shipping nor allow a return of unopened tubes without a restocking fee, even though they incorrectly advertised it. They are great at filling orders, but terrible taking any responsibility for their errors. I gave up, and used more of the product on days when no one will see me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I had known about Amazon&#x27;s money guarantee before I opened the other tubes. Even though OTA has great prices and shipping service, I will never buy from them again. Suggest carefully researching products before buying from them.</li>
    <li> I am out in high altitude sun exposure all day and this protects perfectly. They have come out with a new TINTED version, and I suggest buying that. Although great, the non tint  goes on white and gives you a purplish tint for a little while until it absorbs. It sounds worse than it is, but it is noticeable. The tinted blends into the skin right away and gives the same protection.</li>
    <li> I am generally a fan of Skinceuticals products.  However, not this product.  Totally did not work.  First and foremost, I know how to properly apply sunscreen and I always wear sunscreen, 30-50 spf.  I applied this product, as directed to my face, chest, and knees.  I applied another product (spf 30) after that to all other body parts.  I burned only the areas that this product was applied.  And even worse, it sealed onto my skin, leaving it sticky after showering on top of sunburned skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have never submitted a negative review until this one.  I hope this will prevent others from harm that this product caused me.</li>
    <li> While the lower SPF Skinceutical products have zinc and titanium natural physical sunblocks (at least the last I checked), this one does not. The primary sunblock is avobenzone, which is organic but chemical. I am still using this, even though it is not what I expected. My next order will be for a more natural product with zinc/titanium.</li>
    <li> Love this brand and all their creams!  My skin doctor recommended it and he was right.  It&#x27;s great for a cream against sun exposure when your outside.  Second time I&#x27;m ordering it.  It lasts me about 4 months - using it everyday.</li>
    <li> I am a victim of growing up at the beach and being too cool for sunscreen, so I wear it every day now.  This goes on easy, rubs in clear, stays on, doesn&#x27;t break out my face like some other sweatproof sunscreens.  I haven&#x27;t been burned since started using it two years ago in any exposure I&#x27;ve been in.  The only trouble is my wife has taken over it&#x27;s use so I have to dig through her stuff to find it since she uses it every day too.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be too greasy.  It did not absorb as well as other Skinceutical products I have used.  Will not buy this again</li>
    <li> Hello,  This product was recommended by my dematologist.  It is excellent.  My skin absorbs it nicely and does not feel greasy or heavy.  It is also a great sun screen.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from a doctor and liked this product. The cost at the doctor&#x27;s office is too expensive. This product doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which I like. It spreads smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy nor does it leave your face looking pasty white. The cost is still rather high but I really like it.</li>
    <li> Good product works well.</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals reformulated the Sport Defense Sunscreen recently...and it is absolutely terrible!  It does not go on smoothly and dries with a streaky white film.  The original version \\&quot;Sport Defense spf 45\\&quot;  was AMAZING and formulated with zinc oxide.  This is a very disappointing replacement and is made with chemicals....wish they would bring back the old awesome product! All of these reviews are based on the old product....NOT this new one w/ SPF of 50.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife she loves it in couple of days you can feel the difference compare to other brands</li>
    <li> strength has no smell, works great and costs only $27 on Amazon.  It protects against those ultra violet rays which do so much damage to the skin.</li>
    <li> I am using it everyday! It is easy to blend on your skin. Smooth and not oily. the Size is perfect that I can put it into my bag for cosmetic stuffs and carry it around in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;I havent got tanned after using it. :)</li>
    <li> I started using this product a few months ago and it is the best sunscreen I have ever used. It does not clog pores, cause breakouts and is protective. I reapply every two to three hours if I am in the sun.  Rebecca in the Deep South</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. As soon as the weather is nice and I start being outside I use this sunlotion alone or over my moisturizer. It is a perfect product for the face. Does not create breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now.  Living in the tropics mean sun protection is a must; this product goes on easily, feels thick as you apply it but is absorbed quickly without leaving an oily film on your skin.  It is unscented -- a real plus since I am allergic to fragrances.  I use it on my face daily, and on my arms when I plan to spend some time outdoors.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, not sticky and highly recommended by our Dermatologist which is why we purchased it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this. I have been seeing great reviews and recommendations a ton of places lately and being a sunscreen junkie I decided I had to try it. I already use a brand that I love daily and I really should have stuck with what I know and love(after trying countless brands and formulations). I went boating over the weekend with temps nearing the triple digits and while I didn&#x27;t get burned this product got in my eyes and stung and burned and almost ruined my day. I seriously could not get it out of my eyes and between the watering and stinging I was pretty much blind which was obviously not fun at all. The formula also caused my face to be greasy and shiny. I really should have stuck with my UltaMd Sport.</li>
    <li> have been using for years.  great protection, and the price was great too.  thanks</li>
    <li> spreads well, withstands sweat if you use enough. I will continue to buy it until I find one at a better price that works as well.</li>
    <li> Light sunscreen, great consistency for the face, I like it a lot.  I will buy this product again and again.</li>
    <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue and that it&#x27;s SPF 50. Goes smoothly on. But I honestly don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really working. Maybe it is</li>
    <li> I use this on days that I swim because the other skinceutical sunscreen I use isn&#x27;t water resistant. I like the SPF 45 better than the 50. The SPF 50 can look more white than I prefer. But it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy which is common in water resistant products.</li>
    <li> Protects well, just wish it didn&#x27;t have to leave white in all the creases in my skin.</li>
    <li> If you want a sunscreen that nothing gets through, this is it.  I play water polo and this stays on and keeps the sun out.  spend the $$$ its worth it.</li>
    <li> I have worn the SPF 45 Sport UV for over ten years.  Loved it.  The new formulation of SPF 50 is not the same product and does not perform like the old one.  It has a chemical smell, leaves a white film that does not blend well and stains my darker clothing.  The SPF 45 formula was discontinued in 2013 so any reviews prior to that are not for the product now being sold.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by a friends whose dermatologist sels it. ,I love it - it&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t run  when I sweat.  Perfect in the heat and humidity of Florida.  A little goes a long way, and I never get any burn on my face at all.</li>
    <li> This is a not a good product for face or arms since it leaves a white residue even after it is rubbed well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals Sunscreen SPF 45 on a daily basis for many years. This is not the same product, as the formula seems to have changed. This USED TO BE a fantastic product. If you can get your hands on the original formula (it will say &amp;#34;Z-Cote&amp;#34; on the front of the tube), I will pay you big bucks for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it is a new FDA regulation, but this product no longer contains Zinc Oxide. The new version is horrible. Chalky, not transparent, thick. VERY disappointing.</li>
    <li> This product comes highly recommended by my Dermatologist.  Works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> i like the eye cream, it doesnt irritate my skin but the 50uv defense does not feel at all like it is protecting my skin from the rays of the sun.  my skin is highly sensitive to the sun and i have used couple times skinceutical 50 sport uv protection, let me tell you my skin gets itchy and blotchy like i have no protection.  nice that its lite on the skin but the protection i severly need? i use nutrigena for that till skinceutical has a better sunscreen.  it does NOT stand behind it&#x27;s word</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for my face when I run.</li>
    <li> Treats my skin right. Much more even skin tone after using for most the spring and summer. My dermatologist will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of spendy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen - I have sensitive skin and this is the only one I have found that is sweat-proof but does NOT make my skin break out. It lasts through half-marathons easily but still gentle and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several sports sunscreens and i am yet to find one that does not make me look like casper when i start to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is light weight&lt;br /&gt;Con: When i sweat my face is the same color as the product and it drips into my eyes and stings.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen on the market.  It provides excellent skin protection.  It never runs into the eyes of the wearer, regardless of how sweaty one gets.  It is fragarence free and applies easily.  I highly recommend this product.  [[ASIN:B001CJE0MC Skinceuticals  Sport UV Defense Active Use Broad-spectrum UVA/UVB Sunscreen SPF 45, 3-Ounce Tube]]</li>
    <li> Finding the perfect sunscreen was like finding the Holy Grail for me.  My esthetician was definitely for the zinc oxide versus the chemical ingredients that most sunscreens have.  I needed a sunscreen that had at least a 30SPF, didn&#x27;t clog my pours and didn&#x27;t suck my skin dry.  A lot of the zinc oxide stuff does that.  Being a lover of tinted sunscreens, I&#x27;ve tried the Clinique City Block, Anessa (Shisedo brand) tinted sunblock, Dermalogicala tinted sunblock (works great, but alas, only SPF15), Neutrogena, you name it - the only thing left to do was to smear mud on my face.  Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t have to, cuz I found Skinceuticals Sport UV SPF45 sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the stuff is chalky and yes, it&#x27;s a bit on the oily side, but the stuff absorbs quickly and lasts a good while.  My first 3-oz tube lasted the whole summer in tropical and polluted China.  I still have enough for at least a month, but decided to purchase another tube while shopping for other stuff on Amazon.  A great find, well worth the money, but probably more suited to mature skin types.</li>
    <li> Oops, I goofed and ordered the &amp;#34;wrong one&amp;#34; because its packaging is so similar to that of the one I use. I use the 20 SPF one by SkinCeuticals that includes transparent zinc oxide, which does wonders for controlling my rosacea and helping my face to look great. My dermatologist had recommended that one to me, and it changed my life. Because the SkinCeuticals sunscreen I use is so good, I assume that this one also is really good, and I&#x27;ll bless a friend with it.</li>
    <li> Works even if you go swimming in the ocean.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen everyday under make up. It is gentle and always feels good. Really believe this helps me in keeping my wrinkles at bay.</li>
    <li> I love, love this sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy looking &amp; doesn&#x27;t siting.</li>
    <li> best sunscreen ever.  no burn all summer hiking in southern colorado.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  I teach horse back riding so I am out in the sun most of the day.  It also is a very nice base for makeup.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only Sun screens I&#x27;ve used on my face that has such a high SPF without causing a burning sensation when applied</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for fall, winter and spring.  It also serves as a moisturizer.  I wear sunscreen year-round but switch to a serious French one in the summer because while this protects from burns, freckles seem to appear anyway.  But I love it.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and years.</li>
    <li> This sun block is non-greasy.  Looks good on and keeps my skin in great condition.  I play golf or tennis every day.  Summer and Winter. I&#x27;m told that I look 20 years younger than my age!</li>
    <li> not leave the house with this product have been using over 5 years love it</li>
    <li> I live in an extremely hot and humid climate; plus I sweat very easily.  I hate to use sunscreen because I feel like I have plastic wrap all around my body and I cant breathe.  However, as much time as I spend outside, I have no choice but to use sunscreen.  This product is very &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; inm comparison to other 45 sunscreens.  I do not feel like I am being smothered when I have it on.  Plus, it works well.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the same product I have been buying for years from my dermatologist at the same price. It is very good under makeup and is fairly waterproof.</li>
    <li> I am a devotee of SPF 45 which in their infinite wisdom, Skinceuticals has decided to rework and upgrade to SPF 50.  I have been using SPF 45 for years, and with my dry skin, it felt like I was putting on a second layer of moisturizer on my face.  It blended wonderfully with my skin, kept my pores clear and made my skin look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the SFF 50 and afer one use, I am returning it.  IT&#x27;S HORRIBLE! It&#x27;s like taking cold cream from the frige and putting it.  It does not blend into the skin, the more you try to put it on, the more it clumps together on the face and the fingers.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, you will return it just like I did.  Stupid Skinceuticals, messing with a product that was already wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have tried every sunblock on the market. As a tennis player in So FL I use a lot of sunblock, especially in the summer. This one is the best for protection and for sensitive skin. It is too expensive and I get every last bit out of the tube by cutting it in half when it won&#x27;t come out any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see it&#x27;s available outside of the dermatologist office where they charge $10 more than amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the face (no breakouts, like with other products).  I&#x27;ve had melanoma (so I know sunscreens) and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this sunscreen UV skinceuticals,ork great and only available online. she buys a couple and use if a long while before restock. Great for sun and moisturizer everyday.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my skin. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clog and does not feel thick at all. I like this sunblock above all others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Use everyday in the AZ desert. Great for your skin.... Doesn&#x27;t run in your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not getting burned, has a really &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; industrial smell, but goes away pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Not the same original formula that the 45 SPF was made from. This one is not as good!</li>
    <li> excellent sunscreen however the expiration date was very close to expiring, luckily i used it pretty quick. it&#x27;s quite expensive for the amount, but it has really good protection and it does not make me look ghostly, i don&#x27;t know how sweat proof it is compared to other sport based ones but i was very happy, my skin is protected and not clogged.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. I recently bought the tinted one by Skinceuticals which had many positive reviews, but I don&#x27;t really like it. I still prefer the Sport UV Defense Active.</li>
    <li> have used in the past, has worked well , also there have been no skin break outs.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed that I could not order the sun screen with zinc oxide</li>
    <li> This is one o the best creams for sun protection, been using it in my face several years.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and I love this sunscreen. It goes on very easily under makeup and is gentle on the eyes if you happen to accidentally get a bit in your eyes... No stinging!</li>
    <li> Terrific, it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen for my fair skin</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really gives you the sun protection that you need and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes.</li>
    <li> The product contains transparent zinc oxide.  Unlike other products which contain zinc oxide, this one is not greasy, and does not  cause blemishes.  It goes on white, but quickly fades.  It lasts in strong sun.  I used another product for a while and went back to this because it works very well.</li>
    <li> Bought this specifically as it was spf 50 for on my face while playing tennis. Supposedly waterproof and sweat proof.  Also wanted an untinted product which ruins anything white i am wearing. It got into my eyes and hurt to the point of interrupting my match. Will not purchase again. Have had better luck with Elta md products and even coppertone sensitive SPF  50. I have tried many brands at many price points. I will not put this on my face again because of the discomfort it caused me in my eyes.  Probably fine for the body...</li>
    <li> Wonderful sun screen.It was recommended by my doctor and even protects in Florida summer sun.</li>
    <li> This rating is for the spf 45, which is no longer being produced. The spf 50 gets 4 stars from me, as it is slightly more greasy than the 45. I really miss the 45!!! Why must everything be &#x27;improved&#x27;?!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, just a tiny bit goes a looong way, have combination skin type and this not leave my skin oily. Have been using this product for many years now and I have no problems with getting too oily during the day or acne at all. I use just a tiny bit right after I wash my face in the morning and it really protects it against the sunlight, my face is super pale, just how I like it!</li>
    <li> I buy this regularly and wear it EVERY day. People constantly ask me what my secret is in regards to my even looking face/skin. I tell them Skinceuticals. I&#x27;ve never missed a day of wearing it in almost 15 years and the great results show!</li>
    <li> Great sunblock recommended to me years and years ago from a plastic surgeon. I only use it on my face. No drips, no sweat, and it works great.  Expensive but I only use a small amount- a large pea-size drop.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Kept the skin and face from burning despite hours in the sun. I would recommend this product for any type of skin tone.</li>
    <li> Love the sunscreen but not the white residue it leaves behind!!</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have been using it for many years. Any time I get low on it I buy another.</li>
    <li> I wear this every day. I put extra on when I ride my horse. I am engaged in a horse sport, so I sweat a lot and this does not burn my eyes like other products. This is the best sun screen available as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> I have had skin cancer several times and two Mohs surgeries, this is by far my favorite sun screen.  I put it on every morning right after I shower and let it soak in before I put on make up.  You need to let it absorb for a few minutes, but it is worth it.  I have tried almost every sunscreen out there and this is my favorite.</li>
