    <li> The pens are tiny! I didn&#x27;t realize that mini meant micro, so that is on me. Otherwise..super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> These markers do not work. They will wipe off as soon as you go to wipe of where you just tattooed and they actually don&#x27;t work on the skin very well at all. I would definitely not buy these.</li>

    <li> Very nice pens! Transfers onto the skin smoothly! Best product I&#x27;ve bought to go along with tattooing!</li>
    <li> The ink in the marker bleeds trough the skin making it harder to outline</li>
    <li> This product states that it is a &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; tip marker. When I opened the marker to examine it, it was different than the picture shown. In the picture the marker tip looks &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; but the makers I received were not. It was the size of a regular marker. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again for I can just use regular markers. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to make detailed corrections with this.</li>
    <li> These are good for the first and second use then they dry up immediately. I would not recommend these at all, a total waste of money.</li>
