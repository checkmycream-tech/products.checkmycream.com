<li> Very good for long curly hair and very bad water I have been using this product for years only use on ends</li>
<li> If you buy the 911 Emergency in this bottle, it is thick, rich, and works wonders on damaged hair; it gets a five hands down.</li>
<li> what&#x27;s up with the long neck?  </li>
<li> So I get the big bottle and always re order when I&#x27;m down to the last quarter.</li>
<li> I leave this product in and let my hair air dry.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not happy about the new bottle design.  </li>
<li> i have extremely damaged, dry, brittle, overprocessed hair that has gone through hell over the past 2 decades.</li>
<li> It is thin like a creme rinse and does not condition the hair at all like the old formula.</li>
<li> i have to make it upside down before squeeze it out.</li>
<li> A small amount goes a very long way.</li>
<li> Relax hair will use less .</li>
<li> My girlfriend uses it and normally has difficult to manage hair.</li>
<li> Little pricey for the product</li>
<li> This is a very thick product, and the extra long neck makes it difficult to get out of the bottle.  </li>
<li> Silky hair and growing, which for me feels like a small miracle.</li>
<li> it is hard to find</li>
<li> I have thick wavy hair.  </li>
<li> the cream is thick, should come in a jar.  </li>

    <li> Profuct was not sealed undrr cap. Pretty sure it&#x27;s not the product listed, but filled with a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> New as ordered But not bottle in photo.my bottle was Blue?</li>
    <li> Great stuff but difficult to find so it needs to be ordered through the mail which adds shipping costs.  Works well to calm frizzes and have smooth hair.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle worker.  If you have dry and/or damaged hair, just a small amount applied after shampooing left on for a few minutes and it works miracles.  It is worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with this product. It wasn&#x27;t cheap, I expected to see some kind of results.</li>
    <li> Great.  Ordered on a Sunday, got the bottle 1/2 of the product on Thursday, early!  I did order two bottles and they are coming separately but that does not matter to me.</li>
    <li> Love the Emergency Pak, great for my thick, course hair.  Softens my hair without a buildup and leaves it shining.</li>
    <li> I have dry, brittle, frizzy, thick, wavy, hair and have gone through EVERY product out there for years!!! When I stumbled on this one....it has changed my bad hair days into excellent hair days!! It is a little expensive, but worth EVERY penny.  Haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years. I am bi racial, and wear my hair in kinky curls 98% of the time. Hayashi 911 re constructor I leave this product in and let my hair air dry. I have found that it holds my curls in place and keeps them from frizzing out. Its also a great detangler. I originally bought it in Toronto, but the store there no longer carries it so I have had to resort to ordering it online. So I get the big bottle and always re order when I&#x27;m down to the last quarter. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you buy the 911 Emergency in this bottle, it is thick, rich, and works wonders on damaged hair; it gets a five hands down. However, if you get the purple bottle, the formula has changed and it&#x27;s no longer the same product. It is thin like a creme rinse and does not condition the hair at all like the old formula. I&#x27;d give it a one or two star rating. I understand from the seller that Hayashi changed the product as well as the packaging...too bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 15 years.  But, it&#x27;s difficult to find in the stores.  I was so happy to find this online.  It&#x27;s less expensive, and I don&#x27;t have to drive around.  I&#x27;m not happy about the new bottle design.  This is a very thick product, and the extra long neck makes it difficult to get out of the bottle.  Apparently, the genius who designed this doesn&#x27;t actually use the product.  Nevertheless - it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
    <li> Item is as described.  Arrived on time.  Recommend this seller.l</li>
    <li> Product makes hair nice soft yet strong at same time detangles . Smells good doesn&#x27;t weight down hair after putting on a lot . Made my hair mor manageable especially after going through a natural hair transition from being relaxed. If you using on natural hair might use quite a bit &amp; will go fast . Relax hair will use less .</li>
    <li> i have extremely damaged, dry, brittle, overprocessed hair that has gone through hell over the past 2 decades. i bought a packet of this stuff to try it out. i followed the instructions and my hair has never felt so amazing and soft before! it felt thicker, fuller, healthier, and soft! i have tried so many different hair masks and i will definitely be buying a full bottle. it is hard to find but luckily the beauty supply store by my house sells it!</li>
    <li> I am always happy with this product and it has helped my usually dry hair by making it softer&lt;br /&gt;and healthier! never leave home without it</li>
    <li> After a Hiatus from using this in my earlier years, I am reunited and it feels so good!  Silky hair and growing, which for me feels like a small miracle. I have biracial hair and this stuff does beautifully!</li>
    <li> excellent product for hair</li>
    <li> I am constantly bleaching/dyeing my hair. This was my best friend when I bleached my hair to pure white. I would just leave it in for 5 mins after every other shower and I had no split ends. If your hair needs a little extra attention. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years, and have never found a better product for conditioning colored hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Will save your hair. I have used it on my own hair and on human hair extensions. I change my hair color dramatically and I change it often. 911 saves it.</li>
    <li> great product, my hair is no longer frizzy.  the cream is thick, should come in a jar.  what&#x27;s up with the long neck?  i have to make it upside down before squeeze it out. the old packaging is better, new one looks cheap.</li>
    <li> This stuffs works like magic. I literally saw results after just one use.</li>
    <li> I beach my hair ( Blonde) and this I use EVERY day and it keeps my hair in-check, nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to manage.</li>
    <li> This product right here is everything. My hairdresser has been using this product in my hair for years. Hayashi 911 is great for all hair types. A small amount goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I have very dry curly  hair.  It is an excellent conditioner</li>
    <li> Very good for long curly hair and very bad water I have been using this product for years only use on ends</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!!  I&#x27;ve used other reconstructors and nothing else compares.  I have thick wavy hair.  When I use it,  my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just ok, that;s all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using 911 for years. It is amazing and could use some marketing. A fine product, works instantly and moisturizes as it repairs my colored hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use for my hair and I believe it does wonders for my hair. It makes it silky and smooth to the touch.</li>
    <li> WOW... This is the best product i have ever used on my hair it makes your hair silky and not dry out!!!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of highlights and after using many heat tools I damaged my hair a lot. I have used the Hayashi 911 to help with my problem and I have to say it is a great product to make the hair look healthier. Its not a miracle worker so you need to go to the salon and get rid of your split ends but thanks to this deep conditioner I can take an inch at a time instead of all at once.</li>
    <li> Little pricey for the product but it works great. My girlfriend uses it and normally has difficult to manage hair.</li>
