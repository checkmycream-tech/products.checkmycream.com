      <li>The more I inhaled, the more I liked the scent.  </li>
      <li>; I had no intention of smelling too many brands), I knew that if I found something that smelled nice, I&#x27;d be able to get a sample.  </li>
      <li>However, the smell to me is too powdery, too soapy, and too overpowering to really be enjoyable.</li>

      <li>I find most men&#x27;s colognes smell like bug spray.  </li>

      <li>I really enjoyed PRADA cologne, I used it and got a lot of compliments of a lot of Women.</li>

      <li>Now I can officially say that The Devil Wears Prada:)</li>
      <li>I love it came on time</li>
      <li>And I did  Love it ....</li>
      <li>If you love \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scents - then this might be the scent for you.</li>
      <li>I thought being sold by Amazon it would be okay.</li>
      <li>PERENNIAL FAVORITE--</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite scents for men.  </li>
      <li>skin the smell changes and smells even better.</li>
      <li>it was way better that time.</li>
      <li>I cannot tell me how many times women have asked me what I am wearing when I used Prada for Men.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s honestly much better after it&#x27;s been on you for an hour or so.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like the fragrances I wear most of the time (mostly fresh, aqua scents, loving Hugo Element), but that&#x27;s honestly why I got it.  </li>
      <li>This is a very unique fragrance.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is excellent and stays on for a long time.</li>
      <li>3rd party shipping was free and delivery packaging &amp; timing superb.</li>
      <li>It is still a classic that smells excellent with the right body chemistry, just a light semi-sweet smell...</li>
      <li>The Prada makes you smell fresh, clean, and it lingers on me all day (in a good way).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Very fast shipping and in good packing.</li>
      <li>I recommend going easy on the number or sprays you use as one or two (tops) is sufficient to slay the ladies.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful and is almost half the cost.</li>
      <li>but I was suspicious when the PRADA on the bottle was huge when compared to my existing empties.</li>
      <li>This is one of the sweetest, attractive to my nose colognes that I&#x27;ve smelled or owned in the last 10 years.   </li>
      <li>Too cheap for me.</li>
      <li>Now I hope that my friend will like the scent as well, and if he tries it, it&#x27;ll smell good on him!</li>
      <li>It has a soapy light clean smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is not even close to the original, although the color is.</li>
      <li>Additionally mine did not come with an Atomizer which the original is meant to have.</li>
      <li>Love the crisp, clean scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely clean, and that is the dominant theme in the scent.</li>
      <li>It smells clean and gets noticed without &amp;#34;filling</li>
      <li>I order this product, which smell great, however because it didnt come as a seal top, it wasted in</li>
      <li>That said I wouldn&#x27;t say it necessarily smells feminine, it just smells good period.</li>
      <li>I tried many times, and sprayed much on me and my clothes, but never got a compliment, compared to the PRADA I bought at the \\&quot;M\\&quot; Store.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
      <li>, I am delighted with the purchase of an authentic Prada fragrance which was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>It smells so fresh and clean</li>
      <li>To me it has that fresh clean powdery baby smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great fragrance and price</li>
    <li> I was worried this would be a fake Prada fragrance, or be diluted, still making it a fraud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I am delighted with the purchase of an authentic Prada fragrance which was exactly what I expected. Its a beautiful smell, a good product, a good sale.</li>
    <li> this is the best scent for a man .  Very sophisticated I even want to wear it myself.  And I did  Love it ....Wont buy any other.  when youve tried it you will be hooked on it too. .</li>
    <li> I can still faintly smell it in my room. I put it on on my porch about 2 maybe 3 days ago before I went to work. I can still smell it from across the room form the close hamper.  I can&#x27;t describe the smell very well. Its definately not common, i&#x27;ll tell you that. You won&#x27;t run across it on a lot of people in a club and especially not in a bar.  There is nothing woodsy or rustic about this smell. It is all modern. And so far as I know Axe nor Old Spice has come out with a deoderant emulating its smell.</li>
    <li> One the best perfumes I have ever had. I get complements every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> I like the scent.  I first bought at Sefora for 90+ but bought my 2nd bottle here for a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> This cologne is not \\&quot;over the top,\\&quot; and has a smell of sophistication! The best cologne I have purchased to date.</li>
    <li> I shopped Macy&#x27;s. Nordy&#x27;s and a couple other high end department stores and they all sold Prada Classic for men.  Buy it here at Amazon.com and get the 3.4 ounce bottle for the same price the department stores sell the 1.7 ounce bottle for!</li>
    <li> This is one of the sweetest, attractive to my nose colognes that I&#x27;ve smelled or owned in the last 10 years.   All I can say, wearing it on myself or smelling it on someone else, is WOW!  [[ASIN:B000P43JXQ Prada By Prada For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz]]</li>
    <li> Complex and sophisticated fragrance - not your usual man&#x27;s cologne yet not feminine. Does last a long time and the bass note is pleasant in the afternoon. Great price at Amazon.</li>
    <li> There are many colognes out there, many brands. Prada is one of those that feel a little more exclusive than others here in the USA, has more of class than some hip hop trend.</li>
    <li> I first got accquainted with this fragrence in a &#x27;MensHealth&#x27; magazine with Jamie Foxx/Adam Lamberg (if I&#x27;m not mistaken) dual cover for the September 2008 edition.  Ever since, I have wanted the fragrence.  The sample insert smells great.  However, the actual liquid has 10x time the range.  The day it arrived February 1, 2010, my mother could not stop getting a whif of it.  She even sprayed it on an index card.  As a woman, she stated that this is the type of men&#x27;s cologne that draw women to men.  Just like there are certain colognes that men like for women to wear.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> It is still a classic that smells excellent with the right body chemistry, just a light semi-sweet smell...I like it and My ladies love it! Try it you might like it! I received it in excellent condition and in a timely manner! I recommend Amazon for shopping and ordering all colognes!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome.  A thing I like to do is get close to a female while I notice her head move up toward me as if trying to get a closer smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping and in good packing.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it. I have worn this colonge for years now and believe me the wife knows the smell. I dont know where Amazon...yes Amazon got this bottle but I was suspicious when the PRADA on the bottle was huge when compared to my existing empties. The smell is not even close. I&#x27;m truly shocked. Called Amazon and they refunded didn&#x27; t want it back and told me to just post feedback when I said I wanted to talk to someone about this since selling fakes is a crime. Nice eh?</li>
    <li> I have yet to have any luck with Cologne or perfume from amazon, I think I am 0 for 4 or 5 now. The daily scent just dose not last as long from the store for some reason.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me for xmas, when I opened it I could tell right away it was a (bad) fake. The metal plate looked like a 5 year old made it, the bottle itself was so bad that I don&#x27;t know how it didn&#x27;t break during shipping, and lastly it smells like crap, I mean chemical crap. The seller did refund me every last dime but the disappointment on my wife&#x27;s face when I told her it was a fake was heartbreaking. So buyer beware...</li>
    <li> This is a very unique fragrance.It smells really good,like rich soap and amber.The longevity on my skin is about 5 hours,it does not project like a beast,those are the downfalls of this fragrance,Otherwise it is great...</li>
    <li> great smell,,,love it,,,long lasting</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent! It is simply amazing. This scent is well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love the crisp, clean scent. Perfect for a tropical country like the Philippines.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell me how many times women have asked me what I am wearing when I used Prada for Men.  Honestly, I get embarassed when a beautiful woman asked me.  The funny thing is my wife isn&#x27;t crazy about it.  It is always strangers.</li>
    <li> I just sprayed a sample on my hand and can&#x27;t seem to stop smelling it. I probably looked weird smelling my hand in front of the sales guy at best buy. I&#x27;m liking it a lot more once it settled into the skin. Just a little bit will probably go a long way. I think the ladies will be more crazy about it than I am, but isn&#x27;t that what counts anyway? I wouldn&#x27;t doubt that there&#x27;s a perfume out there that smells exactly like it. That said I wouldn&#x27;t say it necessarily smells feminine, it just smells good period. I also figured out what it smells like in lay terms. To me it has that fresh clean powdery baby smell. and who can argue with that, unless you&#x27;re a complete jerk.. So the question is, will the ladies be subconsciously thinking of me as baby making machine when they get a wiff of this.. ;0 maybe I&#x27;ll update some day..</li>
    <li> I hate colognes and this is my favorite scent.  It&#x27;s delicate yet manly and almost has an aromatherpy effect to it for me.</li>
    <li> I love it came on time I have a very good experience with the product, the product is excellent and I love it</li>
    <li> YUP... this is the stuff.... I recommend going easy on the number or sprays you use as one or two (tops) is sufficient to slay the ladies.</li>
    <li> Good smell nice price and the women love it.</li>
    <li> PERENNIAL FAVORITE--A HIT WITH THE BABES</li>
    <li> I order this product, which smell great, however because it didnt come as a seal top, it wasted in my over night bag, which was because of the spray pump that you have to attach. now Im out of prada and my money. wow!!!!!</li>
    <li> This scent took me back to a youthfull state of being, when I have the opprtunity to use it I do. There is only two fragrances I wear like a glove and the other is usher.</li>
    <li> It took me a day or so to get used to this cologne.  It especially smells dry and clean when you first spray it.  It&#x27;s honestly much better after it&#x27;s been on you for an hour or so.  It&#x27;s not like the fragrances I wear most of the time (mostly fresh, aqua scents, loving Hugo Element), but that&#x27;s honestly why I got it.  Really, what&#x27;s the point of having 10 colognes that all smell similar?  I&#x27;m trying to keep my selection new and different, and this scent goes a long way in helping me do that.</li>
    <li> best smell ever.  This is my third bottle.....its a must have.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t do it!!!!  This appears to be a knock-off product.  The bottle&#x27;s markings are slightly different (unless Prada changed labeling recently) and the cologne does not smell the same as the Prada product I have worn everyday for the past 2 years!.  Amazon customer service was very helpful and stated that I will get a refund in 5 to 7 days.  Avoid the trouble and do not purchase.</li>
    <li> I brought this item because I smell it in a store one day but i didnt purchase. So I bought the cologne a couple months later and it was way better that time. Once you spray it and it come in contact with you skin the smell changes and smells even better. Very light long lasting cologne and I recommend this to all my cologne junkies. THIS IS A MUST HAVE PEOPLE. And you cant beat the price. Great gift also.</li>
    <li> Best cologne I have ever purchased. Great Quality. This one was just as good as the one I got from Dillard&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Score!!! husband loves it.  He loves the scent of this and does wear it everyday.  He is just about out and want more.</li>
    <li> Its ok the smell doesn&#x27;t last longer</li>
    <li> The best smell ever. You will love holding your guy.</li>
    <li> Just received my order of this and was astonished. Five or so years ago this was my favorite fragrance- a heady meld of bergamont, cardamom with a touch of patchouli. This &amp;#34;reformulation&amp;#34; smells like baby powder and only like baby powder. So disappointed they messed with a classic. Whoever at Prada signed off on this should be fired. Makes me feel like I should be wearing a diaper rather than some nice clothes.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed PRADA cologne, I used it and got a lot of compliments of a lot of Women. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you want to smell clean, right out the shower freshness. this is the one!! smells like soap. very nice soap!</li>
    <li> This cologne is not offensive to me or others. It smells clean and gets noticed without &amp;#34;filling the room.&amp;#34; I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I bough this perfume for my boyfriend. He adores it. It is fresh, soft and masculine all at the same time.  Not overpowering at all. It was also a GREAT value. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really liked the fragrance, the smell stays for a long time, it is a fragrance that will not let you go unnoticed, it can recommend the good.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift. He loved it. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I purchased this PRADA Cologne on May 26,20104, and got it the very next day. It came in a sealed box, so thought it  was the REAL deal. It looks like what I have bought last time,in a major department store, for a bit more money...This time I purchased through AMAZON I think?  I save the PRADA Cologne from the big Department store I will call \\&quot;M\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRADA as I know it smells great,and lasts quite a long time when sprayed on me. I sprayed it on me after a shower, with nothing else on my body as far as scents go.Smelled great,but then about 5 minutes later I myself lost the scent. I past by my mom, and then a trip to the mall, and no one could smell it..I asked about 10 women.&lt;br /&gt;So, it made me think, that this PRADA, even though it looks real, and packaged real, is FAKE...It is all Alcohol, and vaporizes almost instantly when put on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PRADA in the bottle that I got through the AMAZON site, is suppose to be a darker blue to the eye than what appears in this particular bottle.  U really have to look at the bottle to see a slight hue that even remotely looks like a light blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a beautiful PRADA smell when first sprayed on yourself..So if your buying the bottle to adore yourself and sit in your room all day and spray your body then by all means,this is for you..I tried many times, and sprayed much on me and my clothes, but never got a compliment, compared to the PRADA I bought at the \\&quot;M\\&quot; Store.&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I will buy at the  major Department Store called \\&quot;M\\&quot;, for just a few dollars more, its worth it....I am surprised AMAZON and its parfume shoppes,sell this old or fake product.  It is so easy to dump the real parfume out of a bottle, then use a funnel to pour in alcohol,and about 10% of the real PRADA. maybe some blue food coloring, and pop the sprayer back on, re-seal the celephane on the package, and use a heater machine that melts and stretches the plastic and melts it, so that it looks like it was packaged before it was switched.  Now this is just what I suspect, but the PRADA I GOT, was no good, FAKE...I spent alot of Money on a product that I have used in the past,but bought at a major store..I tried a PRADA product a year ago on AMAZON and it was the same to worse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps the next person that is thinking of Getting PRADA, well this 3.4oz (AMBER) for men cologne.  I am stuck with a $54.00 bottle of FAKE liquid,PUT INTO A prada BOTTLE, AND PASSED OFF AS THE REAL DEAL,WHEN IN FACT THE SCENT DOESN&#x27;T LAST PAST 5 MINUTES,IF YOUR LUCKY.. i GOT \\&quot;ripped off\\&quot;...THEY TOOK MY MONEY.  i WILL END UP GOING TO macys AND PURCHASE prada THERE. YOUR ALWAYS GUARANTEED ITS THE REAL DEAL. i WISH amazon WOULD REFUND MY MONEY, FOR i DON&#x27;T DESERVE THAT STUFF IN THE BOTTLE,WHATEVER IT IS??switched.

    <li> A great value.  Saved over $20.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Rive Gauche PH and I put this Prada in the same general ballpark.  The Prada makes you smell fresh, clean, and it lingers on me all day (in a good way).  I also have the Extreme version but think this might be better.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling men&#x27;s colognes I have ever purchased.  My husband loves it.  It smells clean and fresh and seems to have a little lime with a lot of vetiver.  If you ever liked Visit, you&#x27;ll love this one.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents for men.  It smells so fresh and clean I buy it and spray it throughout the house because it smells so fresh and clean.  Any man who wears this will get compliments, guaranteed.  Fast shipping and great packaging too! Will order again.</li>
    <li> I gave those as a gift to my husband and he loves it. It is really long lasting and delicious.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Awesome and really inexpensive !!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000P43JXQ Prada By Prada For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used my gift certificate for this item from amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my first prada product....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the \\&quot;duft\\&quot; is somewhat sexy and young..sweet smell...too much applied..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and you will definitly get the audience attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..i use it mostly for personal times with friends.....the scent tends to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; linger for days in my sports clothing.....</li>
    <li> I have used Prada for several years, I have tried some of the other fragrances but come back to this one.  I think each person needs to find the product best for them and stick with it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Arive before from the time they toold me.</li>
    <li> This is clearly a fake. Liquid is clear when it shold have a light blue color to it. The word PRADA is the wrong size on the bottle and worst of all it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it should. I thought being sold by Amazon it would be okay. How wrong I was.</li>
    <li> I luv this stuff....  One of the best colognes out there for men.  A great size &amp; good size &amp; price point.</li>
    <li> I bought this 4 times, and I will buy it forever,,,,, Wherever I go, I have the same question... WHAT IS YOUR FRAGRANCE?</li>
    <li> I find most men&#x27;s colognes smell like bug spray.  So when a friend asked me to recommend a cologne for him, I approached the task with some trepidation. Do I choose something based on what I know of him?  Or what I like a man to smell like?  How many bottles will I have to sniff before I pick something that smells nice?  I went to a chain cosmetics place because I know that not only do they have a somewhat small collection of men&#x27;s colognes (which is better; I had no intention of smelling too many brands), I knew that if I found something that smelled nice, I&#x27;d be able to get a sample.  After testing a few scents out, I picked up the Prada for Men Eau de Toilette Spray (no matter how fancy it sounds in French, something needs to be done about using the words toilet water when it comes to defining fragrance. Really.) I spritzed some on the fragrance tester paper, and in doing so, some of it went onto my hand. I smelled the tester, and found the scent pleasant.  As I lingered in front of the sample wall, I continued smelling the cologne as it continued to set.  The more I inhaled, the more I liked the scent.  It&#x27;s light, clean and fresh, not heavy. I asked for a sample, which I received.  Now I hope that my friend will like the scent as well, and if he tries it, it&#x27;ll smell good on him!</li>
    <li> I was dupped!!! This is an imitation cologne &amp; Amazon should know this and give the consumer some kind of notice.</li>
    <li> Not the fragrance I am accustomed to. No smell. Watered down!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne a year ago and loved it. I spent almost $100 on it and was surprised to see it on Amazon for $60. It&#x27;s exactly what I bought the last time. Smells wonderful and is almost half the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this scent a few months ago and the scent is amazing. It has a soapy light clean smell. I recomend Prada Amber highly.</li>
    <li> Excellent pricing for such a high end wonderful cologne for men. Took 8 days to arrive and we&#x27;ll worth be wait.  Now I can officially say that The Devil Wears Prada:)</li>
    <li> Yes it did &amp; that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 5 STARS.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is unbeatable .</li>
    <li> Sorry to say that this is not the authentic Prada Amber that I have been using since 2008. The smell is not even close to the original, although the color is. I should have been more wary after reading some of the much earlier reviews on here, as well as recognize that the PRADA on the bottle was much larger than the original (authentic) and even looks fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get a refund and would have gladly returned this, however, regulations prohibit shipping &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; chemicals back....</li>
    <li> I feel bad giving this a two star review, because scents are so personal in general. I did a blind buy of this, not having smelt it before. That was perhaps a mistake on my part, but typically I know what I like and am not disappointed. However, the smell to me is too powdery, too soapy, and too overpowering to really be enjoyable. If you love \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scents - then this might be the scent for you. It&#x27;s extremely clean, and that is the dominant theme in the scent. In its defense, I personally find the smell more appealing after it settles on my skin for a few hours, but immediately after spraying it, I tend to find it to be overwhelming and overpowering. My personal opinion is that a scent should be defining and appealing, but not overpowering. I personally don&#x27;t want people to smell me the moment I enter a room, but rather prefer that they notice the scent when they come closer. I personally just find this scent to be too one-note and dominant to be something I&#x27;d wear with any regularity. It&#x27;s not offensive, it&#x27;s just too much. But scents work different on everyone&#x27;s body, so perhaps it&#x27;s simply not the right fit for me. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice men:s fragrance!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and so does my girlfriend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a unique fragrance for lovers of nature and the outdoors is a pleasure to use and also is a fragrance that lingers long</li>
    <li> The fragrance is excellent and stays on for a long time. Will recommend it to anyone who enjoys a long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> Understated and elegant, this cologne is the opposite of what passes for men&#x27;s colognes and eaux de toilet these days: it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm your fellow humans, nor does it grate  on our senses, or scream in a blaring voice &amp;#34;I&#x27;VE GOTTEN PERFUME ON!&amp;#34; Instead, it&#x27;s a subtle, warm scent, a gentle invitation to closeness.</li>
    <li> i was perhaps expecting too much from the product. but when it arrived it was far from what i expected. perhaps the risk of buying a product online.....</li>
    <li> Very happy with it. I notice women can&#x27;t hold their water when I wear this! Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla</li>
    <li> I may have ordered the wrong one or was shipped. Never followed through to return for not sure who was at fault.  My regrets not the scent for me (I wished for clear color received blueish) 3rd party shipping was free and delivery packaging &amp; timing superb. Would certainly use them again. The one referred to the cologne only.</li>
    <li> This is the cologne!! I  wrote the review for the wrong product, but this also smells divine. I will be ordering this again, too.</li>
    <li> So I am big on perfumes and I had told my boyfriend I wanted a unique scent. He told me of this particular one from PRADA. He said it was very nice and I was sceptical but I allowed him to purchase it for me as a gift. Upon receiving it, I sprayed it on my neck and hand, the scent wasn&#x27;t very strong. Then it hit me! My boyfriend asked me what I thought. I told him It reminded me of flowers, lavender and a soap brand. But I could not pinpoint the exact brand of soap. A caveat of mine is perfumes that smell like you just took a shower. Too cheap for me. Then I figured it out. It had the smell of Irish spring. He was very puzzled as the cologne he knew did not smell that way. Additionally mine did not come with an Atomizer which the original is meant to have. That was when he realised I had been given a fake. So do not buy unless you want to smell like Irish Spring and like Faux Perfumes.</li>
    <li> I love this on my husband.  I have bought this twice and will continue to buy it here.</li>
