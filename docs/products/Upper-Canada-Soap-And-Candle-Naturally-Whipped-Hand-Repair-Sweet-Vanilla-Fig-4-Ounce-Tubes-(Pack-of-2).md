      <li>This would probably be a very good hand cream for a man to use too.</li>

      <li>It moisturizes great.  </li>
      <li>Happily, this hand cream fits both criteria.</li>
      <li>my part, he is welcome to it.  </li>
      <li>so I was happy it smelled good,</li>
      <li>I like this delicious smelling cream because it is luxurious, paraben free, has shea butter, and even has aloe.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>and it does smell good.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are good withthe exception of fragrance.</li>

      <li>I think it would make a good gift, or a nice addition to the guest bathroom.</li>
      <li>He likes this product very much and told me to give it an excellent rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is nice but real strong</li>
      <li>Smells nice (but not TOO purdy).</li>
      <li>The scent is kind of like vanilla almond.  </li>
      <li>It does leave a kind of ...</li>
      <li>I liked the vanilla fragrance it set off.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the scent of this hand cream.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is defnitely a top notch, A plus, hand repair cream for both men and women.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to perfumes, so it must not smell flowery, perfumery or have any overwhelming fragrance to make my nose itch and irritate my sinuses.    </li>
      <li>I love fig.</li>
      <li>Many dermatologist-recommended cremes I&#x27;ve tried do not have the staying power of this balm.</li>
      <li>Many hand creams I&#x27;ve used that are not oily soak in the skin immediately</li>
      <li>I had a favorite, but it disappeared off the shelves, so I guess they don&#x27;t make it anymore.    </li>
      <li>I cant stand overwhelming scents.</li>
      <li>It is has the warm sweet smell of vanilla with a hint of fig, and is not overpowering as some of the boutique lotions.  </li>
      <li>This one has a nice vanilla smell that is not too sweet or overpowering.  </li>
      <li>This lotion does a pretty good job, but for my tastes it&#x27;s a bit too greasy.</li>
      <li>This wonderful natural handcream is worth a try ...</li>
      <li>My wife says this stuff is pretty good, but nothing all that special.  </li>
      <li>This is soothing, has a nice aroma leaves a nice, soft feel to the skin.</li>
      <li>But here, vanilla dominates and it is too strong for me.</li>
      <li>first applied, the lotion smells very sweet, almost cloying, but after the lotion is absorbed, the smell is mild and pleasant.</li>
      <li>People around me have also commented positively about the scent, that it is warm and inviting.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>If you happen to require the same things of a hand cream that I do, I would happily recommend that you try this one.</li>
      <li>Is it as light as the \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; intimates?  </li>
      <li>First it is not sticky and clamy, most importantly for me the scent is not too strong.</li>
      <li>I tend to purchase body and hair care products with mild or no scents added, so this product was not to my liking with its very sweet vanilla aroma.  </li>
      <li>It comes in a very nice big bronze tube with a brown flip-open lid.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a rich, creamy feel, but it leaves almost no residue after you rub it in.  </li>
      <li>This one feels the way that you dream that whipped cream would feel, but it leaves you feeling refreshed and clean instead of sticky and ashamed.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;sweet vanilla</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;sweet vanilla\\</li>
      <li>It says \\&quot;Sweet Vanilla Fig\\&quot; on the label.</li>
      <li>It just works better if one doesn&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Sweet Vanilla Fig\\&quot;</li>
      <li>the \\&quot;sweet vanilla</li>
      <li>Also the feel of this is a bit too greasy, it&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>The lotion seems most effective for immediate relief of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>I do, however, love the scent (this is my favorite of the Upper Canada hand lotions).</li>
      <li>This is a good product that goes on smoothly with minimal greasy feel.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a sent, but I liked it.</li>
      <li>It is completely natural, but works better then the best, and most expensive hand creams.</li>
      <li>I have eczema and fairly chronic dry hands.</li>
      <li>Overall, a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>It is absorbed  by the skin quickly.  </li>
      <li>I think it smells kind of funny - like pancake makeup, or old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
      <li>I like that it was free of certain chemicals in its production like PABA.  </li>
      <li>then she would like, but it was quickly absorbed.    </li>
      <li>The cream nourishes and nicely moisturizes hand skin, especially with a tendency to overdrying.</li>
      <li>** (something many hand creams are not, especially the cheap varieties ladden with all sorts of definitely-not-so-good-for you chemicals).</li>
      <li>That is right</li>
      <li>I am ready now for a good, hard working hand cream after my operation on my hand, and it is OK at this point that it is scented</li>
      <li>so if you are sensitive to perfume or strong odors this may not be for you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a good product, it really seems to hit the spot for helping out with your hands and other areas that tend to get rather dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working</li>
      <li>This is our first time using any of this company&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>The first thing you notice about the balm is its smell-</li>
      <li>It works pretty well</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>First thing you notice, of course, is the smell.  </li>
      <li>fig\\&quot; scent is pleasant and not overwhelming.    </li>
      <li>The smell is fairly pleasant and the lotion is not too thick.</li>
      <li>Once the lotion has absorbed, it continues to make your hands feel very soft.  </li>
      <li>It is very thick, and leaves the most lovely scent on my hands.  </li>
      <li>in the medical field and having to wash my hands every few minutes they tend to get warn out with all soaps (even though we use better soaps than most places).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>or if you do not care about the smell too much.</li>
      <li>What can I really say about hand cream?  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about lotion, because I&#x27;m a guy.   </li>
      <li>If you use too much, it won&#x27;t absorb well and your hands will feel greasy.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to see specific essential oils.  </li>
      <li>usually just use a store-brand lotion, but that stuff wears off, or out, quickly, and I find myself having to put more on over the course of the day.  </li>
      <li>I cannot really comment on whether this product is effective in that regard since I cannot imagine using it enough to test it out, even though I do have some callouses on my hands from weightlifting and also suffer from dry skin during the winter months.</li>
      <li>It goes on pretty smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy film as some other lotions do.</li>
      <li>The smell is decent if you like vanilla, and it&#x27;s not overpowering by any means.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The scent does seem more natural than other scented creams.</li>
      <li>My wife and I both tried it, and we came to pretty much the same conclusions.</li>
      <li>and you end up needing more in a few minutes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I will never stop using this product. It is completely natural, but works better then the best, and most expensive hand creams. I have now used it for 3-weeks, every night I apply the cream thoroughly, and then need to re-apply just a dab during the follow day after washing only. This is the only hand cream that I have used, and I have tried about 50, that continues to work throughout the entire day after it&#x27;s use the night before. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing. Try it. No gimmick. You WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product that goes on smoothly with minimal greasy feel.  I like that it was free of certain chemicals in its production like PABA.  The scent is nice but real strong so if you are sensitive to perfume or strong odors this may not be for you.</li>
    <li> This is soothing, has a nice aroma leaves a nice, soft feel to the skin. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you like heavily scented body products, then you might like this item more than I did.  I tend to purchase body and hair care products with mild or no scents added, so this product was not to my liking with its very sweet vanilla aroma.  I also found the product to be heavy/thick, but I suppose it&#x27;s meant to be that way in order to help \\&quot;repair\\&quot; hands.  I cannot really comment on whether this product is effective in that regard since I cannot imagine using it enough to test it out, even though I do have some callouses on my hands from weightlifting and also suffer from dry skin during the winter months.</li>
    <li> So when I first got this tube of hand cream, I squeezed out a small portion.  I was a little taken aback by the texture and thought \\&quot;This doesn&#x27;t feel right\\&quot;.  Then it hit me - it&#x27;s \\&quot;whipped\\&quot;!    It really does feel \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; - not light and frothy but lighter than your average deep moisturising cream.  That said, here is my judgment of its properties.    Does it work?  Yes.  It moisturises well using a relatively small amount of product.  That means that the little 4 oz. tube (you get two) will last a while.    Is it as light as the \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; intimates?  Yes and no.  It is absorbed  by the skin quickly.  It does leave a kind of ... powdery feel and creates a less than desirable solution if your hands get wet.  I think it might be best suited for nighttime just-before-bed use.    How does it smell?  The \\&quot;sweet vanilla fig\\&quot; scent is pleasant and not overwhelming.    Overall, a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:27721101]]Heath Buckmaster opens up a container of Naturally Upper Canada Whipped Hand Repair Balm and talks to us about the product, what it contains, and how it feels.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful.  Not like the sometimes fake/perfumey ways vanilla can smell in beauty products. My daughter loves it also.  It is very thick, and leaves the most lovely scent on my hands.  It moisturizes great.  I noticed a big difference after using this before bed.  If you clean alot like me, and have to wash your hands frequently, this product would definetly pleasently take care of any unwanted dry hands.</li>
    <li> What can I really say about hand cream?  I&#x27;m a man, after all.  I&#x27;m supposed to have rough, callused hands that I occasionally treat with the lard from a beast that I&#x27;ve slain myself in mortal combat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I hate having those little rough spots on my knuckles, and, even worse, those cracks you get around your fingernails when it gets really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually just use a store-brand lotion, but that stuff wears off, or out, quickly, and I find myself having to put more on over the course of the day.  This cream, however, lasted from just after the shower to the end of my work day without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a rich, creamy feel, but it leaves almost no residue after you rub it in.  None of that oily sheen here.  The \\&quot;sweet vanilla\\&quot; fragrance is present, but it is subtle, like a candle burning in another part of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; feel of the cream.  Have you ever looked at a handful of whipped cream and just wanted to rub it all over your hands and face?  Have you ever had to clean up a mess like that afterwards?  This one feels the way that you dream that whipped cream would feel, but it leaves you feeling refreshed and clean instead of sticky and ashamed.</li>
    <li> Even with a dishwasher, there is no way to avoid washing pots and pans.  Added to general housecleaning and cold weather, it&#x27;s a formula for chapped hands.  This cream is thick and leaves a protective coating without feeling greasy or sticky.  You only need a little at a time because it is so thick and it does smell good.  Keep it in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> Winter tends to take its toll on these old hands. We&#x27;re talkin&#x27; dry chapped hands further irritated by inescapable industrial strength institutional soap. Upper Canada Soap And Candle Naturally Whipped Hand Repair Balm (now that&#x27;s a mouthful) seems to help. Not too greasy. Smells nice (but not TOO purdy). &#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> The Amazonian King wholeheartedly agrees with all the other 5-star reviews: This is a wunderbar, all-natural hand cream that&#x27;s **NON-GREASY** (something many hand creams are not, especially the cheap varieties ladden with all sorts of definitely-not-so-good-for you chemicals). Plus &#x27;tis produced by those wild-n-craaaaaaaazy Canucks... whodathunkit??!! ;)</li>
    <li> This hand lotion is really nice, with a natural smell, and a thick texture. It coats your hands smoothly, as opposed to other lotions which are either too thin or smell like toxic flowers. Once the lotion has absorbed, it continues to make your hands feel very soft.  I would recommend this lotion to everyone.</li>
    <li> I like this delicious smelling cream because it is luxurious, paraben free, has shea butter, and even has aloe.&lt;br /&gt;As I am ready now for a good, hard working hand cream after my operation on my hand, and it is OK at this point that it is scented, this is my choice over all others for what I wish to use every day on my hand ... and on my other hand too ! That is right, I go hog wild and use it on both hands! And why not???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could get really addicted to this!&lt;br /&gt;It is defnitely a top notch, A plus, hand repair cream for both men and women.</li>
    <li> The smell is fairly pleasant and the lotion is not too thick. It works pretty well and I&#x27;ve used it as both a hand lotion and a body lotion. The only thing I wouldn&#x27;t use it for is feet as it&#x27;s not strong enough, but it&#x27;s fine as a hand lotion.    It goes on pretty smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy film as some other lotions do.</li>
    <li> This is a rich lotion and you only need to use a small amount of it on your hands. If you use too much, it won&#x27;t absorb well and your hands will feel greasy. The right amount (for me) was about half the size of a dime. So if the lotion seems too oily, try just using less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion worked well as a repair cream (as advertised); it made my hands feel soft when they were dry. Repeated use, however, does not seem to improve the condition of my skin overall. The lotion seems most effective for immediate relief of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;When first applied, the lotion smells very sweet, almost cloying, but after the lotion is absorbed, the smell is mild and pleasant. The scent does seem more natural than other scented creams. It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Sweet Vanilla Fig\\&quot; but to me it just smelled like vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hand cream has a very luxurious appearance and initial feel. Again, it seems best at immediate relief for hands. I think it would make a good gift, or a nice addition to the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the scent of this hand cream.  It is has the warm sweet smell of vanilla with a hint of fig, and is not overpowering as some of the boutique lotions.  It did feel a little greasy when I first used it, but through continued use, i did notice a change in the condition of my hands.  They have become softer and more supple and do not get dried out and chapped, especially if I apply after washing the dishes.  People around me have also commented positively about the scent, that it is warm and inviting.</li>
    <li> This is our first time using any of this company&#x27;s products. My wife and I both tried it, and we came to pretty much the same conclusions. It&#x27;s soothing but leaves a greasy feeling after each use, which is a big turn off. The smell is decent if you like vanilla, and it&#x27;s not overpowering by any means. We do like the fact that it&#x27;s free of mineral oils and synthetic dyes, but overall we do not believe this is a product we could see ourselves using on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved the smell of this. It went on a little heavier then she would like, but it was quickly absorbed.    The packaging is beautiful and elegant in brown shades. However it is difficult and requires strength to squeeze the last of it out of this tube. She would use this again, it&#x27;s a good value but she wouldn&#x27;t go out of way to find it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good hand cream for about 2 years now. I had a favorite, but it disappeared off the shelves, so I guess they don&#x27;t make it anymore.    I have two criteria for the best hand cream.    1. It has to stick with me for the day. I put it on at night when I go to bed. I have my hands in a lot of water every day, and I have neither the time nor patience to keep applying hand cream all day.    2. I am allergic to perfumes, so it must not smell flowery, perfumery or have any overwhelming fragrance to make my nose itch and irritate my sinuses.    Happily, this hand cream fits both criteria. I have been using it every night for nearly three weeks. It does stick with me all day, unless I am doing something particularly hard on the hands, like cleaning up after painting or cleaning the oven. The hand cream makes the skin feel soft and supple over time ( a short time, actually).    As for fragrance, I am happy to report that this cream does have one, but it is so subtle it is hardly noticeable. It says \\&quot;Sweet Vanilla Fig\\&quot; on the label. Frankly, I do not like the smell of vanilla, and I can just barely detect it here.    This would probably be a very good hand cream for a man to use too. It comes in a very nice big bronze tube with a brown flip-open lid. The fragrance, what there is of it, is not at all \\&quot;girly\\&quot;.    The label says to \\&quot;apply a generous amount to hands before bed\\&quot;. I have found through trial and error that to be too generous with it is counter-productive. It just works better if one doesn&#x27;t use too much. I don&#x27;t know why, but that&#x27;s the way it is!    If you happen to require the same things of a hand cream that I do, I would happily recommend that you try this one.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times so far and I must say I like it a great deal. First it is not sticky and clamy, most importantly for me the scent is not too strong. I cant stand overwhelming scents. I wash my hands often and it gets the jobs done as far as keeping them moisturized. This wonderful natural handcream is worth a try ...it will keep dry, chappy hands in check.</li>
    <li> It works well and lasts for a while.  It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a sent, but I liked it.</li>
    <li> This lotion does a pretty good job, but for my tastes it&#x27;s a bit too greasy. The greasiness goes away after it dries completely, but it&#x27;s still something that rubs me the wrong way (no pun intended). I do, however, love the scent (this is my favorite of the Upper Canada hand lotions). If the price was a little lower, I&#x27;d probably give this lotion 4 stars. But overall, the greasiness and the price are the main reasons I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about lotion, because I&#x27;m a guy.   My wife says this stuff is pretty good, but nothing all that special.  I think it smells kind of funny - like pancake makeup, or old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
    <li> The scent is kind of like vanilla almond.  It goes on smooth and absorbs well.  The afterscent is not overpowering. The ingredients are good withthe exception of fragrance. I would have liked to see specific essential oils.  My wife uses it at home- so it has our vote.</li>
    <li> I was attracted to this cream by the description of the fragrance - I love fig. But here, vanilla dominates and it is too strong for me. The cream nourishes and nicely moisturizes hand skin, especially with a tendency to overdrying. I can recommend it if you like vanilla or if you do not care about the smell too much.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that is not too oily.  Many hand creams I&#x27;ve used that are not oily soak in the skin immediately and you end up needing more in a few minutes.  This one has a nice vanilla smell that is not too sweet or overpowering.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a lotion type of guy so I got this for my wife to try out since she is always using it on her dry hands.  Her verdict was not favorable so I was about to come on here and trash talk this product.    Until my feet ended up getting dry.    So I decided to test this product myself.  First thing you notice, of course, is the smell.  I liked the vanilla fragrance it set off.  I was applying it before bed so I was happy it smelled good, not because I was trying to impress anybody, but because I didn&#x27;t want to be kept up all night with some repugnant smell.    Two nights of this and my dry feet got normal again!  I&#x27;m still not going to use it on my hands but I can tell you that this worked wonders on my dry, cracking feet.  And if it can handle that this well, I can&#x27;t imagine a pair of hands who would fair worst.</li>
    <li> The first thing you notice about the balm is its smell- the \\&quot;sweet vanilla fig\\&quot; fragrance is dark, strong, and extremely heavy. I found it cloying and somehow remiscent of butter frosting. I think the scent dissapates and lightens a bit after application, but remains smelling the buttery. That said, the product does work well. I have eczema and fairly chronic dry hands. Many dermatologist-recommended cremes I&#x27;ve tried do not have the staying power of this balm. It keeps them hydrated through the night and prevents cracking or flaking. Also, it absorbs quite quickly, so barely any oily sensation remains after it is applied. For those that have sensitive skin and try to avoid unnecessary color additives, this balm comes out white. I would buy this product again but in a different scent.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have been using this product.  My husband is extremely picky (read won&#x27;t use just anything) about hand lotion, and he has been using this several times a day for over two weeks.  He likes this product very much and told me to give it an excellent rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my part, he is welcome to it.  I usually like vanilla fragrances, but this particular one, Sweet Vanilla Fig, isn&#x27;t something I like to have on my hands.  I can detect the vanilla, but there is something else there that is somewhat unpleasant to me.  Come to think of it, maybe that&#x27;s why my husband likes it, because it does smell somewhat masculine.  Anyway, the other reason I don&#x27;t care for it is because the product really coats your hands (not greasy); some people might like that, but I don&#x27;t.  So, I took off a star for those reasons, but remember that my husband really likes this product, making the end point that it becomes a matter of personal preference.</li>
    <li> Like I said in the title,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product, it really seems to hit the spot for helping out with your hands and other areas that tend to get rather dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working in the medical field and having to wash my hands every few minutes they tend to get warn out with all soaps (even though we use better soaps than most places).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does do a good job on helping your hands to be calmed from the irritation of washing and gloves on and off all day but... the smell of this stuff is just too strong for me, it could certainly be toned down a few notches. Also the feel of this is a bit too greasy, it&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not great either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that I&#x27;m a man and all I don&#x27;t need to be smelling like a fruit cake at work. That&#x27;s my biggest gripe with this product. Other than that I like the fact that it&#x27;s not loaded with all kinds of crazy chemicals.</li>
