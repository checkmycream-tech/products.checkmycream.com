    <li> Very happy,..thank you.</li>

    <li> Use to get this from my hairdresser for a lot more money.  She said it was being discontinued so I went online and found it.  This product is a nice smelling light oil that calms the fuzzies and frizz.  Have used it for years.  I ordered six bottles which will last a long time.  If you like this product you will also like Oriofluido.  Both make hair shine and look healthier.</li>
    <li> Awesome for my split ends</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product. will recomend this hair oil to anyone. It does exactly what it says. Leaves your hair  light</li>
    <li> Addicted to the scent!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years however this particular oil I received was rancid.  I had purchased 2 bottles and returned them both however I only received a refund for one.  Would NOT purchase from this vendor ever again.</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased a small bottle from a local retail store and immediately fell in love with this quality product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this on my ends.  a little bit goes a long way, and it turns my frizzy ends into silk.  I am going to be very sad when they stop making it.  It blows aragon oil out the door.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling hair serum, and softens your hair without feeling oily.  I use it after I blow dry or straighten to calm down any fly away hairs.  I have purchased four times in the past two years. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Awesome, looks good, smell great!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Gives hair softness and shine without being oily. A tiny bit goes a long way so it lasts and lasts. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> This product worked much better than the other Alfaparf hair serum.  I applied a few drops to dry hair and the shine lasted for a few hours.  It&#x27;s not greasy, did not weigh my hair down and has an ok scent.</li>

    <li> I love this little purse or travel sized hair oil. It has a nice clean smell. I will be ordering a bigger bottle soon.  A little goes a long way but I have very frizzy dry hair and it did not feel greasy after this was applied.</li>
    <li> Excellent for very fine hair</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this product when styling my hair. Iove the light fragrance. Great product for using with a straight iron.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and leaves my hair soft and nice. Love it!</li>
    <li> dont care for the mesll</li>
    <li> Love this serum.... smells great and makes my hair very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommended...just make sure you check the size of bottle that you are buying</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and only use this product when I straighten my hair. I just use 2-3 drops, rub my hands together to apply. My hair is shiny, sleek, and it smells great too! I love the scent, very close to honeysuckle. It has lasted me a long time so you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth. I bought it at a salon for a lot more than this. When I finally run out, I will buy on amazon. Definitely buy it to eliminate frizzies or if you want more shiny (without looking oily.)</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product - it smells fantastic - and it works like a dream! I have curly hair and it revitalizes my hair toward the end of the day so I do not need to start from scratch and shower/style all over. a little dab goes a long way without leaving hair greasy or frizzy like other products or silicone based choices. I hope they keep making this product of years to come. It has become my staple, whether wearing my hair curly or blown out straight.</li>
    <li> Great service and a great product</li>
    <li> This oil is light and it won&#x27;t weigh your hair down. I highly recommend it. I won&#x27;t use anything else. Also, it smells great.</li>
    <li> Just an ok serum. The smell is to strong at fist when you put it in your hair.</li>
    <li> So lucky to have found this product - keeps my crazy curls under control and the essential oils keep it healthy.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Smell is nice and it gives shine.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling products ever... I&#x27;ve got this twice in a beauty box as a very small sample and I had to buy this larger full size... and now I&#x27;ve been finished with it for at-least for awhile and now my sample is running out so this is a must buy. I use it for my hair and smells so good you will not even wash you&#x27;re hands after... ♥</li>
    <li> Nice to have this small bottle with which to travel: it is the most excellent &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; (first given to me by my hairdresser, Chen Levi)</li>
    <li> You only need to apply a little. Sadly I had to return product broke me out around hairline. Worth a try.</li>
