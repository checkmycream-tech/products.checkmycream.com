      <li>I am thrilled with it.</li>

      <li>I tried so many things that I lost count.</li>

      <li>Many are drugstore brands, and they are all types: Creams, liquids, scrubs, washes, wipes, cleansers, etc...</li>
      <li>Ok, let me explain.</li>
      <li>I have to hold my breath when using it to avoid its overwhelming, Axe-like perfume.</li>
      <li>It did a great job on getting rid of most of my acne, but it was very drying even with a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>and now she will want more.</li>
      <li>My face would go from perfect one week, to covered in acne the next.</li>

      <li>like I was expecting, but more rubbery.</li>
      <li>bottle lasts me months and months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s also going to try more of their products.</li>

      <li>I love the scrubber and it leaves my face feeling nice and clean.</li>
      <li>After I wash my face it feels very clean</li>
      <li>My face has looked much more clear and clean since I started using this wonderful Go 360 Clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a teen, and this product is the perfect one to make your face acne free, scar free, and smooth!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t see to much results.</li>
    <li> I hated it, it made me break out even more... and it dries the skin like crazy</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  When I first started using it , I felt like it took off all of my makeup the first time.  I would test it by using a white washcloth afterwards and I wouldn&#x27;t see any makeup on it.  Then, for a while. I couldn&#x27;t find the product anywhere, then it reappeared in stores again.  Now I don&#x27;t think i am getting the same kind of clean as I used to.  I used the same face makeup and use the 360 the same way I always have.  Maybe they changed the ingredients when they took it off the shelves?  I still use it and like it, but it seems comparable to the other products I have used while I couldn&#x27;t find the 360.</li>
    <li> I love the scrubbing thing! It feels like a face massage. It&#x27;s super soft, but still helps the cleaning process. The 360 clean works great and has a nice fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face wash! I was a bit unsure of it at first, simply because I&#x27;ve tried so many other products. I&#x27;m 23 years old, and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 13 or so. In recent years, it&#x27;s subsided, and my main issue was cycle breakouts once a month that were extreme. My face would go from perfect one week, to covered in acne the next. Then, I tried this and I was AMAZED at how consistent my skin remained. I haven&#x27;t had a problem since I started it 2 months ago, and my skin looks so much healthier. Now, I spend much less money on my skin care (as opposed to $50 a month for SkinID, Proactiv etc) and my routine is so much simpler! Glad I took a chance on this!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! So happy I purchased this. It is so convenient to have the scrubbing brush attached to the bottle. I am thrilled with it. It locks right into the bottle. The brush pops in and out easily. It makes it so easy to keep up with it. And it cleans my face and throat very well. The cleanser foams super well and really deep cleanses my skin. It feels good on my skin. My face has looked much more clear and clean since I started using this wonderful Go 360 Clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle and I don&#x27;t have any skin complaints, but I really didn&#x27;t expect that for a $6 or $7 product you can get at Walgreens.  I have definitely noticed an improvement using this (along with a treatment and moisturizer of other brands).  I especially like the little scrublet.  It works up a lather really well so you don&#x27;t have to use that much product and each bottle lasts a surprisingly long time compared to some other face washes.  Plus, the scrub provides just that little bit of exfoliation each day without having to use an additional exfoliating product, which is very nice. The back of the scrublet is also a little suction cup so you can stick it to the shower wall and hang it up to dry after each wash--keeping any chance for bacterial growth on it at a minimum.</li>
    <li> Since I was in middle school (11 years ago), I have always had acne. Now I am 21 years old and STILL deal with acne which is very embarrassing since most of my friends have clear skin. Over the past couple years, my skin has started to become more oily especially in my T-Zone which is the nose, chin, and forehead. As you can imagine, I&#x27;ve tried everything and anything to stop my skin from breaking out as much as it has. Some days I remember waking up and having terrible acne on my chin and never being able to get rid of it. I&#x27;d pop my pimples thinking it was okay to do but then the pimples would never go away even after washing my face. I&#x27;ve literally tried everything from Clean &amp; Clear to Cetaphil but none of them worked. I found L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 by looking on a website which listed the best products for oily skin. Since I have combination skin (oily + dry), I needed something with 2% salicylic acid to help my acne/oily skin. I was extremely hesitant to use this product because I didn&#x27;t think it would really work, despite all the positive ratings. I thought what the hell I&#x27;ll try it and if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll move on to the next product I find. I have been using this now for the past 3 or 4 days and my skin has ALREADY cleared up. My nose is still oily but I&#x27;m just glad it&#x27;s getting rid of my acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used to wash my face two times a day (or even at all) but now I do once in the morning and once at night. After I wash my face it feels very clean and I love using the scrublet because it truly helps. Another thing I love too is that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the face wash because it really foams up well. I NEVER pop pimples anymore and just go over newly formed ones with the scrublet which amazingly, get&#x27;s rid of them! Another product I use with this is Oil-Free Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer only on my cheeks and sometimes chin to keep them from getting dry (that&#x27;s where my face get&#x27;s the most dry). Using both of the products together has made my face so clean and soft, even my boyfriend said he&#x27;s noticed a huge difference. My boyfriend, his family, and I are going on a cruise in five weeks so I&#x27;m glad I found something that will make my skin clear before our trip. If only I&#x27;d found this product months ago!!</li>
    <li> 2% salicylic acid, but isn&#x27;t so harsh it really affects you skin.  Will dry it out after a while though.  Love the scrubby that comes with</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s of this cleanser: I like this cleanser because it does get rid of my acne. I suffer from cystic acne and no other Salicylic acid product really cleans out my pores like this does. I used olive oil as a skin treatment a little while back and it left my face a swollen, painful, bumpy, red mess. I was having trouble getting the acne to go away until I tried this product. This Loreal line is supposed to get your face realy completely clean but I feel that only the Anti-Breakout does that. The Salicylic acid removes dead skin cells and leaves my skin super super smooth. It is the only cleanser in this line that I&#x27;ve noticed truly leaves my pores completely cleaned out. I don&#x27;t even need to use pore minimizing or black head removing products because this works so good.   Cons of this cleanser: There really isn&#x27;t many cons to this cleanser. I just recommend not getting it in your mouth or eyes because it doesn&#x27;t taste good nor feel good. There is something in it that makes your skin feel tingly that does this. Also I don&#x27;t recommend using the scrubblet. It DOES NOT. clean your skin. I tried using the scrubblet but when I got out of the shower I noticed that makeup was still on my face and my pores were still clogged so I took some cleanser and put it on my hands and washed my face in a upward motion because your pores are pointed down and this will push the cleanser up into your pores to clean them out. Also when I used my hands the cleanser removed dead skin cells much more effectively. My skin was super clean and smooth. I advise against using a wash cloth or any exfoliating item to clean your skin with this cleanser because as I stated before acne medication exfoliates and removes dead skin. Now if you want something to use that unnecessary little scrubblet for use it to apply lotion. Just put a dab on the scrubblet and rub it over your face till the lotion is absorbed. The scrubblet will massage your skin which will make it healthier. A con to this cleanser is ifyou use chemical free and organic products then this product is not for you. I would like to switch myself but it is too expensive and chemical free and organic products don&#x27;t work for my acne.   Loreal Go 360 Clean product description: Break free of breakouts with this clear complexion secret. Introducing the Go 360 Clean Anti-Breakout Facial Cleanser designed to fight acne with deep pore-by-pore cleansing. The formula with 2% Salicylic Acid works with the super-soft scrubblet to control breakouts and clear blackheads. Now you can clean deeper than traditional cleansing ever could before with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s most powerful acne-fighting formula+the scrubblet. Clinically proven results to significantly decrease the number of blemishes, blackheads, and acne.   Do I agree with Loreal&#x27;s product description? Minus the scrubblet I absolutely agree. I&#x27;ve seen the results on myself and I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a cleanser that cleans deep down or just wants to get rid of acne.   To buy this item click here  This is a review of an item I personally bought. I did not receive it from a company and I did not receive money for this review. This is a personal review.  [...]</li>
    <li> I am one of the few unlucky people who usually have breakouts as a result of facial cleaners (for example: I used proactiv for a little while... as a result I now have scars on my face due to cystic acne which I have NEVER had before), but so far no reaction... My face feels wonderfully clean. The little scruby isn&#x27;t hard plastic like I was expecting, but more rubbery. It&#x27;s very comfortable to use and you feel the cleanliness after you rinse. I recommend this product highly and there will probably be a follow up later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shopping :)</li>
    <li> Excellent book on prayer for kids.  Relevant and easy to read</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but I might have found a skin care product that ACTUALLY WORKS in the L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 Clean Anti-Breakout Facial Cleanser.  I have been struggling with acne since I was about 12 or 13 years old, and I am 18 now and still struggle.  I had primarily whiteheads earlier on, but now my acne has also become cystic and can scar if I don&#x27;t treat it well.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from proactiv to benzaclin to differin to a prescription pill to clean and clear...everything you can imagine, I&#x27;ve tried, and none of it worked.  Sometimes, the products made my skin dry out and my acne persisted.  Benzaclin helped a little bit, but stained my pillows, shirts (when I used it on my back and shoulders), and blankets.  Nothing has worked for me.  Recently, I started two different things:  Beyaz birth control (which is supposed to help with skin issues) and this facial cleanser.  When I began Beyaz, my skin actually got worse for a little while--which is to be expected with a hormone pill.  Once it settled down, my skin went back to its normal, acne-spotted self.  I am basing my current skin condition on the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean Anti-Breakout Facial Cleanser.  My skin isn&#x27;t dry anywhere, and the acne has disappeared.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  I have a tendency to use a bit too much product when it comes to shampoo, conditioner, and skin cleansers.  With the scrubber that comes with the bottle, I find it easy to determine how little product I need.  The scrubber is a bit softer than I expected, and at first I was both skeptical and disappointed in it.  However, I have found that it is truly working on my skin!  Just put a bit of the product on the scrubber and rub in circles and it works like a charm!  Now, my cystic acne and whiteheads have cleared up.  I know that the Beyaz may be a contributing factor to this sudden breakthrough, but my acne really didn&#x27;t clear up until I started this cleanser.  My advice to other teenage girls looking into an acne solution is to try the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go-360 Clean Anti-Breakout Facial Cleanser for a few weeks.  If you don&#x27;t see the improvement that I have, then go to a gynecologist and get started on a pill that helps with skin issues.  I think I have finally found my trick for clear skin!</li>
    <li> Very nice product for deep clean. However, I would not recommend use it everyday during winter days if you have a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing , great !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not overdry the skin !!!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans very good , does not cause more pimples !</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teen-age granddaughter and she loves it and so do I!  Cleans and protects skin very well!</li>
    <li> This works very well!</li>
    <li> Got it for my sister and she loves it. Got it really good deal to try and now she will want more. I personally used the product and it does clearn face very well.</li>
    <li> This product is borderline miraculous for me.  I have seborrheic dermatitis on my face (flaking skin, similar to dandruff) and have been looking for a good facial cleanser that works for a very long time.  The salicylic acid in this product does wonders for my flaking issues (it is the same active ingredient in anti-flaking shampoos such as T-Sal).  I don&#x27;t have acne problems, so I can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy there.      On top of the cleanser itself, the scrublet that comes with it is very handy (thanks to the ingenious design that nests in the bottle) and does a great job in helping remove the scaling.  Combined with a good moisturizer, this has my skin looking better after a week than any product I have ever used.    If you have flaking issues on your face such as mine, this is an outstanding product at an extremely palatable price.  Perhaps there were other products out there that could have done the same job, but this one is a revelation for me.  I pray they keep making it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Walgreens, figuring any cleanser with the same salicylic acid content should work, and I like L&#x27;Oreal products. Too bad I didn&#x27;t pop the top and have a sniff. I have to hold my breath when using it to avoid its overwhelming, Axe-like perfume. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Ok, let me explain. My acne is all over my T zone and then some. I have rows and rows... and rows of acne products. Many are drugstore brands, and they are all types: Creams, liquids, scrubs, washes, wipes, cleansers, etc... you name it, I have it. Proactiv over drys my skin, and Neutrogena is usually too weak. So when I saw this online, naturally I was skeptical. At King Soopers when I saw this, I decided to buy to since it was cheap. When I saw the Scrublet, it was \\&quot;cute\\&quot;. After using the wash in the shower though, my skin was tingly and refresh and 92% of my blackheads were significantly reduced or completely gone. My only problem is the Scrublet gets super slippery in the shower. It helps exfoliate well, and the cleanser itself is an A+! This is my first day, so I will update you later*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: I am not paid by anyone to give a review, all opinions are my own, and I paid for this product myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so dang happy for this. I&#x27;ve tried everything from gels to lotions to whatever when it comes to acne. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive - did nothing. Went to a dermatologist - helped but didn&#x27;t solve the problem. I&#x27;ve tried things that were used on cancer patients, I&#x27;ve tried cleaners, I&#x27;ve tried pills, nothing ever really worked, so I actually quit washing my face because nothing really ever did anything. Well, fast forward about three years. I&#x27;m 18 and I&#x27;m so stressed and I really learn the true value of face washing about my face and started to use Dove just as a soap and noticed a difference and I heard good things about the L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 Clean so on a whim I bought this with the sensitive skin cleaner and I was so surprised, I didn&#x27;t break out! I usually breakout on a daily basis and cleaners help but I always have new ones in the morning, but ever since I started using this, that doesn&#x27;t happen and my skin has cleared up soooooooooooooo much I&#x27;m so surprised, but I&#x27;m so happy! I really just can&#x27;t believe how much it&#x27;s helped my skin. Anyone like me who&#x27;s tried everything out there: you have to at least try this, I honestly don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product due to a few simple bumps I have. It smells ok but this face wash actually made my face breakout even more. I had new bumps appear on my face the very next day after using it. I ended up tossing it in the trash. I will never buy again and I don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for 17 years now and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything - washes, scrubs, creams, natural cures and even prescriptions. Some worked but usually had side affects and most didn&#x27;t help at all. This isn&#x27;t a miracle-worker for my acne by any means. I still break out often and I don&#x27;t think my face will ever be completely clear. But this has been a huge help in controlling the breakouts. The scrublet looked flimsy at first but I love how it gently exfoliates all the blackheads/uneven skin on my nose, cheeks and chin. The wash smells pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t take much to make a nice layer of suds on my face. It hasn&#x27;t ever dried up my skin (although to be honest I&#x27;ve been so rough with it I think my facial skin can handle anything). Best of all when I use it morning and night I really can see a difference - clearer skin, fewer zits and when I do breakout it doesn&#x27;t erupt all over my face.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - wish I could find it in stores! Perfect for my combination/oily skin - breakout free since I started using it a few years ago.</li>
    <li> Works well but it leaves skin dry. A moisturizer is highly recommended. I like the scrubbing pad that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all my friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I struggle with adult acne. I have tried every product on the market. Even VERY expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one clears up my skin in days, and keeps it clear!</li>
    <li> This is my go to Face wash when I feel like I&#x27;m starting to break out. I love the scrubber and it leaves my face feeling nice and clean. I have combination skin (oily T-zone but dry elsewhere) this doesn&#x27;t dry out my face too much and definitely gets rid of all the oil buildup through out the day.</li>
    <li> I have an oily face, but I do not suffer from severe acne. However, I live in the desert and sand clogged my pores. I had tiny pimples on my face. After using this product for a week I have noticed an tremendous difference. My face feels a lot cleaner and I hardly have any of those bumps. It has also diminished the amount for blackheads that I have. It also does not super dry my face as other products have done in the past.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking the scrub thing would help clean dirt from my pores. It did nothing of the sort and actually made me break out a lot. I decided to make sure by quitting the face wash and then starting it up again a month later. My acne was significantly less during that month without it. I&#x27;m told the scrubber actually spreads the oil from one part of the face to ALL over, so that may be the problem. I have thrown the stuff away and don&#x27;t recommend wasting your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something similar to the (now discontinued) face wash i had been using &amp; this is .... not it.  This is horrible.  It smells like soap, it completely dries out my face, it suds so much it gets everywhere but where I want it to be, the world smells &amp; tastes like it for the rest of the day even if you DON&#x27;T use it near your nose or mouth.  It doesn&#x27;t help against breakouts, my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean after I use it, and there&#x27;s a weird scrubby thing that takes up space in the bottle where there could be cleanser - although since I don&#x27;t like it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> Seems to clear up any minor breakouts, haven&#x27;t tried it during bigger ones though.</li>
    <li> I like the product but it was drying out my skin just a little but I would buy it again because it stopped my acne me outbreak.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Scrubs your face well</li>
    <li> I love this line of face washes -- the little scrubby they come with is PERFECT in utility. They don&#x27;t leave you feeling too dried out or shiny and tight. Big fan!</li>
    <li> Doesnt work, hasnt plastic beads that goes in to the ocean.</li>
    <li> This face wash is a bit on the runny side and it sorta stings your face in the good way. It lathers up pretty well and it got rid of my acne quick. I think this is great for all skin types, but it could be a little drying for some people. Just use a good  moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> I wash dishes at a restaurant and i needed something to keep from breaking out. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my main concern was it making me break out worse from a previous experience with a different form of the product. It has a pleasant fresh scent, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my really sensitive skin. Although I&#x27;m pretty sure the scrublet is making any acne stay below the surface. I&#x27;ve exprerienced an increase in acne not coming to the surface, staying under the skin in a painful bug red lump.</li>
    <li> I have tried at least three kinds of the Go 360 facial cleanser, but this one is by far the best. It really helps with breakouts, and have an incredible scent! I get compliments all the time on my face&#x27;s smell, strange as that is. It leaves you feeling clean and refreshed! I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I recommend a bit of moisturizer afterward; it may dry out the face slightly. But it&#x27;s worth it to have a clean, good smelling face</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She was wanting to try something different than the usual she has at home and she really likes it. I think she&#x27;s going to make this her every day cleanser. She&#x27;s also going to try more of their products. Great product and value.</li>
    <li> It works really great. The formula is gentle yet effective.  The price is also great.  My only downside is the plastic scrub.  i find it a bit wasteful to get a new one with every bottle.</li>
    <li> Loreal is always a nice product and this cleanser is very gentle on my skin without making it feel dry. It&#x27;s works wonderful so it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;m one of the folks that never write reviews. I stumbled on this product by accident. I had been having really bad outbreaks and nothing was working. I felt so desperate. I tried everything and even gave up sweets, juice, and my favorite CHOCOLATE! Nothing worked! So...I orayed. I felt like I was turning into someone else. I was in recognizable in the mirror. I tried this product and the next day I promise you my pimples were nearly gone. My face felt so clean and bright. I am hoping this really continues this way!</li>
    <li> love this!! Works so  well!!</li>
    <li> I like this product - it leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a game-changer, I still get the occasional breakout that I get with other products, but I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> love this product and GREAT PRICE compared to all the drugstores and grocery stores around my area!!!</li>
    <li> It is better than I expected, though it&#x27;s smaller than I think. It washes clean and it is not too dry.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as foamy as what I want. EFFACLAR CREAM is still the best but expensive.</li>
    <li> Bad skin is genetic in my family. My mom had it and so did my father. My brother had it worse and then it was my turn. My acne was horrible and I tried so many things. I tried proactive and that stuff didn&#x27;t work, I tried the Avon system and nothing. I tried so many things that I lost count. Finally, my mother and I were at wal-mart looking at face washes and we came across this. I liked the scrublet it comes with. I can really feel it getting into my pores and getting rid of the oils and dirt that builds up in my skin. It&#x27;s a deep clean without the harshness of a scrub. This stuff smells great. It doesn&#x27;t smell fruity or flowery, but it smells good. It&#x27;s not harsh like other acne treatments. It&#x27;s gentle just like it says and it won&#x27;t dry out your skin. A month after using this my skin had remarkably improved, and now, after who knows how long of using this stuff my skin is acne free. There is of course that stray blemish around that time of the month, but it&#x27;s nothing like it used to be.</li>
    <li> Sometimes, I break out. I can&#x27;t lie. I&#x27;m sickly and these things happen. So I ran out of my neutrogena and I thought, hey I&#x27;ll give this stuff a whirl! It&#x27;s crazy cheap, why the heck not? And, while I&#x27;m not regretful, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this one this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it works. I was breaking out all over, it was a bad week for whatever reason and that&#x27;s cleared up. Yay! The scrublet. I LOVE that little scrublet thingy! You pop it out of the bottle and it&#x27;s soft and squishy and you rub it on your face and that&#x27;s fun! You feel very sciencey and accomplished when using the scrublet. It&#x27;s sort of minty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: super drying. I have to moisturize every time I use this. I&#x27;m a huge baby about actually taking care of my face. Why can&#x27;t it just take care of ITSELF? But you can&#x27;t avoid it. You&#x27;re going to have a DRY face after using this stuff, it is known. It&#x27;s sort of minty feeling. That&#x27;s kind of weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: in summer, this probably rules. In winter? Not as much.</li>
    <li> This product really works I have really oily skin and one wash clears all the lily&#x27;s and dirt from my skin and i also use clean and clear advantage mark treatment[[ASIN:B002THQK4W Clean &amp; Clear ADVANTAGE Mark Treatment, 0.5-Ounces]] which helps me with my blackheads.</li>
    <li> hello. ive been using loreal 360 for about 3 months. i am a black woman and i have oily skin and bumps pop up out of no where. this stuff had cleared my skin. i have no bumps. i wash my face with this and it does dry my skin so i moisturize with Johnson&#x27;s baby lotion the all natural one with no scent in it. my skin is smooth... now i have about 5 our 6. dark scars from bumps ok my cheeks to get rid of. any suggestions. does loreal have something for that.</li>
    <li> I had to stop using the product after three days because it almost dried out my face completely, except for my nose and chin. It did a great job on getting rid of most of my acne, but it was very drying even with a moisturizer. I might try out the one for sensitive skin, but will not use the anti-breakout one ever again.</li>
    <li> Dislike the actual product itself, but the scrublet is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last five years now. Leaves my skin feeling refreshed. Wish I could only purchase the scrublet!</li>
    <li> I usually stay away from the benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, because recent experiences it made my skin horrible with the chemicals on my face. Months later I tried a gamble with this product hoping it would do something because the reviews were good and it did! Couple of days and i cans see difference, i hope it stays getting better rather than worse. This product does get a little drying so make sure day AND before you go to bed put on moisturizer, noncomedogenic so it wont clog pores. I will update a month later and tell you guys if it is still improving my skin!</li>
    <li> I really like how the scrublet feels on my face, but I&#x27;ve been getting random zits weekly, whereas before I only got them around my period. I might try their sensitive skin version of this or the general exfoliating one since I really like the scrublet.</li>
    <li> So, I sometime get dry patches on my face if my acne product doesn&#x27;t have anything to moisturize the skin. I also have oily parts on my face and get acne on other parts. I have a combination skin type. I really needed something that got rid of the acne and oil, but still kept the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They got 2/3. This product got rid of the acne and oil, but it made the dry patches even more dry. I started moisturizing with lotion and such after using this product to get the moisture back, but it didn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scrublet is a good idea, because using your hands to wash your face can actually add more oil from your skin on your fingers. This product is making progress, but needs a few more improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to people who have sensitive skin and get dry patches like me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 and I used this face wash after reading good reviews about it, but I had a terrible experience with the product and want to put it out there. After using the face wash for a few days I was waking up during the night, because my face was severely itchy. No matter how much moisturizer I used the itching wouldn&#x27;t stop. I thought the cause was allergies and didn&#x27;t suspect it to be the face wash. However, after about a week of using the product I broke out in acne worse than I&#x27;ve had in my whole life. I had scrubbed primarily on my right check as I had more pimples there than anywhere else, and my entire cheek broke out in cystic acne. I&#x27;d never had cystic acne before, not even while I was a teenager. I think I either had an allergic reaction to something in the face wash, or that the scrubber actually damaged my pores. I&#x27;ve learned that the best way to treat skin is to treat it gently, and any kind of scrubbing is damaging. I stopped using the product, but its taken almost a year for my skin to heal because the breakout was so bad.</li>
    <li> leaves your face clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Having somewhat oily, yet normal skin in the hot summer, I bought this product in hopes of solving my breakouts.  Somehow I got just the opposite.  My skin severely dried out and cracked, became extremely sensitive to my normal (high-end) facial moisturizer, and I actually got more and worse breakouts than before.  The scrubber is too soft and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate.  I&#x27;ve never had any reactions like this from any of the numerous facial washes I&#x27;ve tried; I honestly think it&#x27;s just a poor product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin pretty much done puberty and am now 25 years old. My skin in combination, being oily in my t-bone and very dry on the rest of my face. I typically prefer cream cleansers so they don&#x27;t over dry my face but like gel cleansers for a deeper clean with my clairisonic. I would have between mild to moderate acne. I just rarely have clay skin. When I do is like having a good \\&quot;skin day\\&quot; and is short lived. I bought these when I was on a budget and was impressed. It didn&#x27;t dry me out. It has a very subtle cooling feeling whole you wash your face. Pretty refreshing actually. The scent is a mild clean soap  smell. It lathers very easily so it&#x27;s great for removing make up especially with the little soft scrublet it comes with. Since it lathers so easily you don&#x27;t have to use so much and it does last a long time. I&#x27;d give this product a 3.5 to 4 stars. Its not a miracle worker but it&#x27;s dependable and gets the job done. I do see that it helps with my stubborn break outs and appreciate the gentleness on my skin.</li>
    <li> Tried and tested. Works well for my skin</li>
    <li> I brought this product after seeing it at walmart for quite sometime. After using it my face feels very clean! The pad even shows the results of the dirt coming out. my problem is my skin is still breaking out and my skin is burning along with dryness and redness. I just used the product an hour ago and my skin is still burning.</li>
    <li> So cool how the little scrub brush picks up all the dirt hiding in the nooks and crannies. Love it!</li>
    <li> Good cleanser for oily skin. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Favorite now! Still using the last bit. Wonderful scrubber!</li>
    <li> The scrub brush works really well in lathering and removing dirt and sunscreen on your face.</li>
    <li> Fun to use scrub brush</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Go 360 products are so awesome. Your skin feels so smooth and clean (w/o getting dried out) after using the Go 360 line. I&#x27;ve loved the daily cleanser (baby blue bottle) for years, so much that I couldn&#x27;t imagine needing this, so I almost didn&#x27;t buy it. But I can see using this is for a different purpose; weekly clean-up and smoothing. And frankly, any company that puts these products out, deserves my money. I don&#x27;t mind giving L&#x27;Oreal a few extra bucks here and there. If I had one reservation, it&#x27;s that this product has a medium scent that I don&#x27;t require at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found every other product that purports to do anything for your skin to be overpriced junk/snake oil (Clinique, Dermalogica, Proactive). When I see Go 360 on store shelves I buy 3 or 4 bottles, because I want to use these products as long as possible. I don&#x27;t want to be at mercy of another firm that discontinues a product on a whim, because their bean-counters decide they&#x27;re not hitting their target numbers.</li>
    <li> Wish lists are great!  My granddaughter was very pleased with this item from hers.  It sure makes it easy for me to get her something she is really going to like.</li>
    <li> I read reviews online and decided to let my daughter try this.  It worked really well.  Not too drying, but definitely helped with the breakouts.  Then, we ordered the Clarasonic and the combination has been incredible.  No more trips to the dermatalogist!  I have not been able to find this product in any stores, so we will continue to order online.</li>
    <li> This product is EXCELLENT! If you&#x27;re looking for something to help with getting clean of acne, than this is the product! I&#x27;ve used it for about 4 days and it works! It even fades away past acne scars! Just use is twice everyday and you&#x27;ll be acne free! I&#x27;m a teen, and this product is the perfect one to make your face acne free, scar free, and smooth! I recommend this product for people who need to get acne free within days!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Walmart because Ulta stopped selling the exfoliating kind from Go 360. Almost instantly, I developed tiny little bumps all over my face. Not redness like acne, but just this terrible bumpy texture that was really visible in the light. I felt like a reptile. I think it was because it is so drying, even when I applied moisturizer. I found the exfoliating kind again at Walgreens, and my skin returned back to it&#x27;s normal texture.</li>
    <li> I use this along with DDF treatment. Works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash, the little scrubber works out all my clogged pores on my nose and chin. I used it after a benzoyl peroxide wash as well to get a deep clean and I have great results. ive tried the other 360 clean ones but prefer this one</li>
    <li> I brought this face wash to try it because my face recently broke out. After one use my face started clearing up. I will continue to use this product and recommends it to anyone who wants fast results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of brake outs must use with 360 they work well together.i like it will keep using it</li>
    <li> Really good product! It makes my face feel very clean and soft afterwards, it came with a scrub brush attached!</li>
    <li> I love this. Makes my face so fresh feeling and super clean. The washing scrubber is a nifty feature.</li>
    <li> This product works great! It is a nice bonus to receive a scrublet to use with the product. It seems to clean my pores well, and prevents acne from occurring.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I use it daily.  It&#x27;s not harsh or stripping.  It&#x27;s great for a daily wash.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Seems to be effective. I would buy again</li>
    <li> This product keeps my skin clear of acne (when I&#x27;m using it regularly) and the exfoliation from the scrublet makes my skin silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle lasts me months and months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> clean my face very good</li>
    <li> This face wash very nice  and clean face so smooth</li>
    <li> A normal facewash. Helps with breakouts and the built in scrubby is fun and actually does a pretty good job at cleaning away grime without pain or irritation.  Perhaps it is just my skin, but as soon as I stop using it I break out, and I normally have pretty clear skin.</li>
    <li> Smells great, the skin feels soft afterwards, but it does nothing for acne, and i bought it especially for the summer, and  am disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t help with break outs or skin oiliness. It&#x27;s a pleasant cleanser, maybe for people with very minor acne it would be great.</li>
    <li> leave me much smoother Skin medical, I really like the applicator.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this - best face cleaner by far. Love the scrubber pad and that it contains enough salicylic w/o over-drying. Whole family uses this.</li>
    <li> I started using it for a couple of weeks and it didn&#x27;t work for me all it did was make my skin very dry. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend to anyone this is a waste of money</li>
    <li> Great product, like the scrub version even more.</li>
    <li> I just started using it, so we&#x27;ll see how it helps with the breakouts. So far I like the smell and how the skin feels after it.</li>
    <li> This cleanser clears skin up with the least amount of dryness I&#x27;ve found. If my skin starts breaking out this is what I reach for. I have combination skin, so this isn&#x27;t something I use daily. However, when my stress levels go up my skin breaks out and this cleanser is great. I&#x27;ve used more expensive acne products that were less effective. Any dryness I&#x27;ve experienced from this cleanser was minor and nothing a lightweight moisturizer won&#x27;t take care of.</li>
    <li> I love how it leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean. Great product will order again.</li>
    <li> Cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.. good product and I will order again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son when I could not find it at any drugstores, CVS, Walgreens, Etc.  Found it a couple days later in KMart for $3.00 less.  Purchased what they had.  I will keep the order because I think this product might be getting discontinued and it keeps my sons very clear.  At 15 thats very important.  I should have enough now for at least a year or two!</li>
