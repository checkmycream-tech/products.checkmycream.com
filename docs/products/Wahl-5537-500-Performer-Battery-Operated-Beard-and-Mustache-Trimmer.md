<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it to trim around my ears all the time</li>
    <li> i bought this to replace a norelco trimmer that worked faithfully for many, many years. i wanted something that didn&#x27;t require a cord (check), had an adjustable trimmer, (check), cut beard and mustache comfortably (check), wasn&#x27;t overpriced (check) and was quiet (well, four out of five isn&#x27;t bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the instructions, however, are so poorly written that they get two stars; the cutting ability gets five; the value (for the unit) gets five; the design gets three; and the frustrating packaging (blister pack) gets one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you decide to get it, here are a few things you should know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first, as other reviewers have said, **OIL THE UNIT FIRST.** i read that, and blithely  (and generously) coated the very sharp carbon steel cutting head with the supplied oil. oops. &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;one drop is adequate&amp;lt;&#x3D;&#x3D;. i took the cutting blades off to remove the excess before it got into the motor, gumming it up, but the directions *didn&#x27;t* talk about blade replacement. this is easy *if you know how.*  the instructions should explain both removal (obvious: remove the screws) AND how to replace the two spring \\&quot;feelers\\&quot; on the blade. hint: the \\&quot;feelers\\&quot; go into the holes on the bottom of the moving blade, *not* on either side, which is what i did first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next, the instructions *don&#x27;t* show how to attach (or more importantly, how to *detach*) the adjustable head. it provides a good range of lengths from 5 to ~17 mm, but how it works isn&#x27;t covered. it can be puzzled out, but should have been specified. getting it onto the cutting blades is pretty obvious, but taking it off isn&#x27;t. i found that by extending the adjustable plastic head to the longest position, and then rocking it sideways while pulling (and pushing with the opposite hand) the head popped off easily. it&#x27;s not as neat and easy as my old norelco, but given that i need to use the unit once a week, not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;last, a plus: the wahl, surprisingly, is better on the delicate skin of the ears than was the norelco. it&#x27;s a medical fact that as men age, the hair from the top of the head migrates to the ears and nose. (visualize appended smiley). the norelco often \\&quot;bit\\&quot; the ear when trying to remove that hair - the wahl was completely painless and effective, even in the curves and recesses of the pinna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, i think this unit is a bargain. the noise, packaging and the very poorly written instructions are my main complaints. otherwise, it would have gotten a 5 star rating.al fact that as men age, the hair from the top of the head migrates to the ears and nose.

    <li> I received these as a free gift from a tack store and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with them! At first, I was a little sceptic as to the power these little clippers had, but after I used them, I was pleasantly surprised. They clip through thick bridle path hair and clipped short enough to be used as show prep clippers. They are a little loud, but that&#x27;s my only complaint. They will for sure have a permanent place in my arena bag for last minute touch ups!</li>
    <li> I dropped my husband&#x27;s old Wahl beard trimmer; it is currently being held together by tape.  Sometimes it won&#x27;t stay on, but it is still better than this product.  The Wahl 5537-500 is very light-weight; it&#x27;s very loud, making one think it has a lot of power.  It does not.  It would not go through his beard.  It sounded as if it were getting bogged down.  The guides were difficult to attach and remove; I couldn&#x27;t find one short enough  to give him a nice, closely groomed beard.  I tried shaving his neck without a guide; it didn&#x27;t do a good job there as well.  I finished the job with his old trimmer.  Hopefully, I will be able to replace that model.  I absolutely do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this cutter. I can use it by itself or with its accessaries. Even when the batteries are low I can still nip those little overnight hairs. Works for me!!</li>
    <li> Seems to go through batteries fast - several settings for beard length, but no satisfactory setting for very short. Price not bad - it&#x27;s Ok - wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The Good:    Appears to trim just fine.  I bought this primarily for a mustache trimmer and it seems to work just fine (only used it once).    The Bad:    When I initially turned it on (with brand new batteries), it ran really fast (and a bit loud - no big deal).  However, after about ten seconds, the speed dropped down significantly, but then seemed to hold steady at the lower speed.  The metal blades also became quite warm to the touch.  What I figured out was it needed oiling!  A drop of the supplied oil and the speed went back up and the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; went away too.  My guess is this unit was packaged quite awhile ago (it is an older model, isn&#x27;t it?) and the pre-applied oil must have dried out a bit?  It might have been helpful in the instructions to indicate a drop of oil may be necessary prior to first use.    The Confusing:    The unit takes two AA batteries.  One (the left one) sits snugly in the bottom of the compartment. The other sits just to the right and on top of the other battery, raised up so the two batteries are diagonal from each another.  I initially thought the plastic battery guide on the one end forcing the second battery into this position was misaligned.  But it seems to work fine in this diagonal alignment.  A simple note in the instructions of the diagonal battery alignment would have been nice.</li>
    <li> this product works good its a little bit noisy but its cheap and it does the job of fixing your hair and beard. One negative is that is not rechargeable it works on battery</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the trimmer slowing down after about a minute when first turned on.  It appears that the blades are shipped very dry and need oil before running.  I put 3 drops on the blades initially and let it run for about 10 seconds to let it spread out and then wiped off the excess.  It&#x27;s been running great for about 2 months now.  (Be sure to keep the blade tips pointing down so the oil doesn&#x27;t run into the unit)    I like that the trimmer guide stays at it&#x27;s setting after you remove it from the trimmer.  I didn&#x27;t realize what a nice feature this could be. The battery installation is a bit strange (they don&#x27;t sit side by side, but offset to each other) but once in, they work OK.  If they are not seated properly, the cover keeps popping off.    Now that I have worked out the batteries and the dry blade issue, I don&#x27;t think you can beat this trimmer for the price paid.</li>
    <li> I know everyone else has had good luck with this, but not me. The unit started running really slow after about a minute. It also seems to scrape my face. Another nit pick is that the adjustable spacer does not have any marks or numbers on it, so you don&#x27;t know what setting you&#x27;re on.</li>
    <li> This bad boy can cut through the thickest overgrown brad in no time at all.  It also uses only two (2) AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INTERESTING BACKSTORY:  (I will keep it brief)&lt;br /&gt;On a prepper bolg there is a thread posted about shaving during the Apocolypse.  OK, that is another topic, but....several methods were discussed, but most had to do with going back to the primative straight razor, stiptic pencil for cuts, shaving mug with brush, and soap you swish with it, plus the old leather &amp; canvas strop to put a fine edge on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others talked about the old 50&#x27;s style double edged blades &amp; razors that are making a comeback right now. REsharpening the blades on a very smooth stone or ceramic surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see it totally different.  As long as I have RECHARGABLE AA BATTERIES, and a good working solar panel like Goal Zero&#x27;s Nomad, I can keep this shaver going forever.  On the skin it shaves close enough to give the appearance of a 5 o&#x27;clock shaddow.  Not baby smooth, but pretty good.  On a bread it trims it up very nicely and does not get &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34; in your whiskers like some other shavers do.  It also comes with various sized combs to fit over the cutting blades so you do not butcher the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3RD one.  I can see this one being passed down to my grandkids long after all of the Zombies have been eradicated but power has still not been restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not want to be looking like Uncle Cy of Duck Dynasty while shooting Zombies, now do we?  The ladies you rescue will certainly appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only MINOR irritation and MINOR complaint I have is the battery compartment cover pops off very easily.  I fixed it though, with a thick rubber band I made out of a bicycle inner tube.  It was also black and blended in nicely and held the cover on very securely after that.  BTW, the razor will keep on operating even if the cover accidently pops off.</li>
    <li> The product is cheap but of real poor quality.   I would not recommend to buy it even at that price.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is a little noisy, but it cut well and the attachments are great. I get a nice cut every use.</li>
    <li> This is about the 5th beard trimmer I have owned in the last ten years. This one is very easy to handle. There are a couple of adjusters that clip on the the blade area that help a lot for a nice even cut. Cutting the edges is easy and acurate with no trouble seeing where you are cutting, while you are cutting. It goes with me everyday. My little companion.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviews who say this is too loud.  It is nice that it runs on batteries so you don&#x27;t have to mess with charging it, and does just an OK job trimming, but this noise is too much for me.  Can&#x27;t complain too much for the price I guess.</li>
    <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer. My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years. I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings. I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    Deciding to give Wahl one last chance. I purchased the \\&quot;All-in-One Trimmer Kit,\\&quot; given that it had a 5-year warranty. The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage. Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault. However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own. If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later. If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this clipper.  Its much more powerful than the last battery powered clipper I owned.  It has plenty of attachments.  And the price is right.</li>
    <li> Works well on beard, moustache, sideburns, etc. The only (minor) drawback is that the cover to the battery compartment slides opens a bit too easily. Nevertheless, this is an effective and inexpensive grooming tool that will serve you well.</li>
    <li> I was gifted this trimmer in 2005 by an Uncle. I was growing up and had sparse beard but recently I got married and when my wife dropped it mistakenly, she (and myself) realised how that little clipper had been such a key part of my growing into a man - I&#x27;ve had to visit the barber almost every other day. You can&#x27;t imagine my happiness when I found it here on Amazon, I had to just purchase it and will be buying more as Christmas presents.  It&#x27;s handy for trips and can be stored away into a small space in the case you&#x27;re rushing off and need to still shave. The best part for is the fact that it is battery powered - this means I can travel anywhere in the world without the fear of electricity stopping me from looking suave and smooth shaven!</li>
    <li> It looks great in the package with many attatchments and a little bottle of oil...however...I haven&#x27;t opened the package...so I haven&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;tried it yet..........Ed</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a beard or a mustache, but use this only for trimming sideburns, back of the neck and ears.  This works just great for that when you use it without any attachements.  This is the right price for something that you use only occasionally.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a cheap trimmer for my husband. i didnt know he preferred the rechargable type but he said it was ok. kind of noisey but gets the job done. its a great back up trimmer and thats what he uses it for. puts it in his truck for any emergency line ups before a meeting. if you are picky, then spend the extra $20 and get the nicer one.</li>
    <li> Wife got me this trimmer many years ago. It finally died. She bought me two more. I won&#x27;t use another trimmer. Keeps beard nice and neat and tight against my face.</li>
    <li> good product.  works as advertised</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it works better than the $80.00 plus trimmers that I&#x27;ve had in the past.  This is my second Wahl Trimmer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with its performance.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best trimmers that I have used. Had one for atleast 4 years and it broke so got a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for my goatee, mustache side burns etc. Easy to carry and AA battery operated and if you use duracell it lasts atleast a couple of months with regular use.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer at least twice and the average life span I&#x27;m getting is 4 years.  My husband took the first one when we split up so I bought another to replace the one he took.  That was in 2008.  It&#x27;s now 2014.  The one I have is actually still working but I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and now the battery case won&#x27;t stay on so I&#x27;m replacing it.  I didn&#x27;t take the best of care of it either, so the blades are pretty much done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cheaply priced and cheaply made, but not so much it falls apart immediately.  To be fair, it gets light to moderate use from me so the lifespan may be shorter if you use this more than twice per month.  It gets the job done and is priced in my opinion as a disposable.  If I went to the salon or barbershop to shape up my &#x27;kitchen&#x27; or my child&#x27;s fro and sideburns, it would cost me the purchase price for just one of us per visit.  I&#x27;ve got 2 heads to shape up twice per month so this trimmer works great for us.  While it is a beard and mustache trimmer, it&#x27;s great for trimming the hairline and youth sideburns.  I like trimming the nape area to keep my hairline back there nice and straight.  I like wearing my hair up or in ponytails and like my &#x27;kitchen&#x27; to be sharp.</li>
    <li> Does not trim as well as I expected!!! Obviously the reason it was so inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend the purchase of this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wanted something fairly small that can easily be packed in a suitcase for a trip.  Unfortunately this is very cheaply made.  The battery cover broke off the first time I used it.  I had to wrap a piece of tape around it to keep it all together.  It is also very loud, not a big deal, unless others are trying to sleep.</li>
    <li> Not quite DOA - it actually ran, very noisily, for several minutes before dying permanently.  Not worth returning, just goes into the landfill.  Also, the worst imaginable clamshell packaging, the kind Amazon has vowed to eliminate - THANK YOU AMAZON for vowing that - that packaging is HORRIBLE to try to get open, and will give future archaeologists, if any survive, nightmares about what their ancestors must have thought they were doing!</li>
    <li> My husband really enjoyed this trimmer. For such and inexpensive item it gives great results.</li>
    <li> The one I received does a little pulling , could be sharper. I tried a little oil on the blades which does not seem to help much.&lt;br /&gt;I have an earlier model that I went back to using.</li>
    <li> Why 2 units?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son had one and I tried it (after he cleaned it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it enough that I bought one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is junk.  Teeth broke off on installation of plastic trimmer attachment.  A poor representation from an otherwise highly respected company.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know wahl made low quality products like this one considering how long this company has been around. It worked fine and the attachments as well but I only got to use it once. When I tried using it a second time it started pulling the hell out the hair on my beard. I thought it needed a little oil but when I took a closer look I noticed some of the teeth were missing and that&#x27;s when I realized what was pulling my hair. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the worst product so far I bought from Amazon. It vibrates so intense....that I am afraid when I use it. I already stopped using it. Just waste of money. Will not recommend it</li>
    <li> Excellent better than my rechargeable one and more powerful too. Like the attachments and they make trimming of beard easy and safe</li>
    <li> This is one of the older models, and I had one some time ago. It finally went bad. I was surprised to see amazon had it whereas wahls did not / discontinued. This trimmer is very Sharp and precise, no cord is a plus.</li>
    <li> One of the best trimmers I have had so far. The only problem I found is the switch - it can wear out inside and break. I lubricated the switch inside to minimize friction in my second trimmer that I bought and it works great.</li>
    <li> Does not actually work. I tried 3 different sets of batteries and the trimmer turned on once very briefly and quickly shut off again. The plastic housing is thin and very cheap feeling.</li>
    <li> I get these all the time. It Came on time. I have no problems with anything. Love it will keep getting these.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes great trimmers, and this is one of them.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;, which is one of its strengths.  Unlike the rechargeable versions, you don&#x27;t have to dump the entire trimmer when the batteries get too old to charge.  Either use alkaline batteries or AA rechargeables that you can replace yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the battery cover is easily damaged, so I end up having to put a piece of tape over them to hold it together.  The accessories that come with it give you a very broad range of lengths you can preset for.  An excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> Bought to replace a Wahl that I had for 10+ years.  Like the battery operation</li>
    <li> I love this piece of machinery. I use it for all purpose need. I could cut my hair and use it to trim my beard. Just get yourself a couple of fresh AA batteries and you to go and for the price, there is no way you could beat it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> use it about every two days. had it almost a six months hasn&#x27;t crapped out on my yet!</li>
    <li> This is the third Wahl trimmer that I have.  This one does the job, but somehow this model does not seem as handy as the other two I have had.  It may just be getting used to the attachments, but I don&#x27;t like these as well.</li>
    <li> I have two of these trimmers (one is a chrome version, back-up) since they are so cheap, and I mainly bought them because of the fact that I can use rechargable AA batteries rather than a sealed proprietary battery that will eventually get worn out.  I use the clipper without cutting guides to get that one day of growth look.  I&#x27;m an engineer, so naturally I like to modify my tools.  While the tips of the teeth of the fixed blade are not sharp, they are scratchy due to the machining process.  I took the blades apart and sanded the tips of the fixed blade using emery cloth.  Just put the sandpaper on your counter and sand the teeth with a rolling motion to round them a bit and knock off the sharp corners.  Also, the reason some people have complained the clipper is so loud (this black model, my second one, was too) is because there is a wire spring that applies pressure to the moving blade, and in my case one of the \\&quot;feet\\&quot; was not set in its pocket on the blade.  It rattled so loudly that I wore earplugs for a while.  Disassemble it, wipe the blades clean, drop some oil in the friction pockets where the plastic piece rubs against the blade (the plastic piece is the main wear item) and make sure the spring is set correctly in the center (observe the placement and orientation of the pieces carefully when you disassemble, it&#x27;s a little tricky to seat the spring properly and fully in the center and then to simultaneously seat the two spring feet into their blade pockets during reassembly, all while trying to reinstall the screws).  Also, on a day to day basis, drop one drop of oil in each of those friction pockets and on the teeth as often as you can before you use the clipper.  Mine is humming like a champ now.</li>
    <li> this has to be one of the best trimmers on the market.  My father has the same model and it has worked for 6 years!  Glad they make this model still.</li>
    <li> I have used these clippers for a once a week trim for 6+ months without any problems. Very low battery consumption and easy to clean. Be sure to oil it before your first use and remove the batteries when not in use.</li>
    <li> Awful hurts face when using. #1 doesn&#x27;t work either. Would not recommend to anyone. Spend like three more dollars and get something nicer</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about 10 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong. It&#x27;s just getting a little dull.. Very glad to find a another one on Amazon. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get another 10 years out of this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Wahl Performer for years, but it was finally getting dull.  I have tried four other trimmers and none of them measured up.  I finally decided to stop wasting money and buy another Performer.  My only problem now is what to do with the basket full of the other trimmers..</li>
    <li> works better than the old one did. buy it you will not be disaponted with it...and it is also a great buy</li>
    <li> I first got this model trimmer used from a friend of the family in 1998. I still use it to the day (2/5/2013). I&#x27;ve bought several more expensive brands here and there along the way but this thing is still ticking and just as good as ever. (same blades) The AA battery thing is a small setback but I use mine all the way until my hair gets caught in the blade during the shave, signifying that it&#x27;s too weak to operate. Then I just get more batteries. But overall...GOOD TRIMMER. I&#x27;m finally buying a new pair off of Amazon because (1) my old one here has become so used that the &#x27;on&#x27; switch keeps popping to off while vibrating. And(2) I wanted to buy new blades and keep using but no one sells for this old model anymore and the new blades on Amazon are just as much as a new trimmer all together. But one purchase after all these years..ya can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Had one of these for years and it finally died....was able to find one on amazon...I was excited and the people That were on the other side of the ordering were wonderfullllllll....Thank You</li>
    <li> Excellent product  would expect nothing less.</li>
    <li> I was only able to get one use out of these.  The next time I went to use them, it would not turn on.  I tried different sets of batteries but to no avail.  It worked &amp;#34;just ok&amp;#34; in that one use.  Cut pretty easily but left patches so I had to go over the same area multiple times to achieve an even look.  The guard is a little awkward to clip on and putting the batteries in is a little confusing due to the bottom end being significantly more narrow than the middle slanting the batteries a bit. The next time I went to use them, it would not turn on.  I tried different sets of batteries but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- low cost&lt;br /&gt;- cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Short life span</li>
    <li> I have a Wahl Battery powered clipper that looks just like this one. I can&#x27;t find a model number on it and it is at least ten years old and maybe 15 years old. The only difference I can see is that mine takes three AA batteries and this takes two. I thought my unit died and went on Amazon to look for a replacement. When I saw the latest version I read some of the reviews and saw OIL mentioned. Well I can not remember every oiling mine so I loosened the screws a tad and hit it with some WD40. It now works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can say that mine has lasted for 10 to 15 years while being neglected and still works. A valid complaint is that the battery door is marginal. A rubber band takes care of that. For the money and longevity why buy anything else. I did not want a rechargeable unit because I know the battery would be gone and unreplaceable in four or five years. I didn&#x27;t want a corded unit because my wife will often trim my neck (outdoors or standing in the shower - before turning the shower on!) and having to plug it in would be a pain.</li>
    <li> It appears to take a long time to cut back the hairs about my mustcahe and beard. Also it is a little loud. I like the battery and is easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> I got this model free with a full trimmer set, it&#x27;s silver when included with a set. I had the original silver one for about two years before it finally died after extensive use - not a bad lifespan for a free item. The battery cover is held in place by a flimsy plastic tab and if you drop it on the floor it can break. I had this issue, which I solved by taping the cover in place and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. This black unit comes with accesories which the free ones do not include - 3 length adjusters, a brush, comb and some oil. The thing I like about this model is that you can use just the clipper part right up against your skin and it will not pinch you unless you are careless. I bought a Remington model and it will cut without a spacer. The attachements are only needed on the Wahl for length variations. Despite it&#x27;s slight cheapness, it&#x27;s price and performance make it worth it; the best trimmer I have ever used by far.</li>
    <li> Runs reasonably well and has enough power to get the job done.  Have used it for several weeks and no problems to date.</li>
    <li> super nice, great price, and it&#x27;s a Wahl.  I find that there &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; products are just as nice...but the plastic feels cheaper.</li>
    <li> Unlike other clippers I&#x27;ve owned in the past, these started to rust with a week of use. Terrible! Would not recommend these</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as a beard or mustache trimmer, but it does a great job in providing a really low hair cut. Because of its small size it is easy to handle and cuts pretty close without irritating my scale. i don&#x27;t shave my head, so this gives me the same almost bald look without all the hassle.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works well, with steel parts where they are needed. The switch may not be strong enough; it is what failed on my previous Wahl trimmer.</li>
    <li> My 21 year old son is a US Marine and was deployed to Afghanistan for a seven month tour. Early in his deployment I asked him what he needed. Thank God for satellite phones and good old face book and email, which allowed us to stay in frequent contact with each other during his deployment. He asked me to send him a battery operated trimmer because it was 115 degrees everyday and no showers or electricity at the forward operating base! Needless to say he wanted to get rid of as much hair as possible over his entire body, if you know what I mean, since he only had two showers in about four months of being out in the field. I found this one and sent it out and after sending it and him telling me he received it I never gave it another thought. He returned home recently, thank God, and we were talking and I said, \\&quot;hey dude.....remember those trimmers I sent you? How did they work out for you?\\&quot; My son said, \\&quot;dad, you \\&quot;F\\&quot;ing ROCK! They worked great and we all used them to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; The guys loved me when they found out that I had them! So.......if these trimmers can make it in Afghanistan with a dozen or so Marines in a very harsh climate half way around the world for 7 months then I think this product deserves 5+ stars! And after all that use over there he actually returned to the states with them and is still using them!!!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a very thin lever spring that holds the blades together at the correct angle inside the unit.  The spring in my trimmer snapped after about 5 shaves, before I got through the first set of batteries.</li>
    <li> The cutting head is excellent. It works great until one of the batteries moves out of place.  Im going to put putty under the AA batteries to keep them from moving around.</li>
    <li> Rhis little trimmer is perfect for those trims in betwen trips to the barber shop. It is compact and powerful.</li>
    <li> Expected better, but considering the price I should have known the quality would be limited.  Ok for trimming, but not so good for cutting close.</li>
    <li> Clippers arrived in good shape and work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Wahl brand trimmer before and this in comparison is a disappointment.  It isn&#x27;t very sharp so it pulls at my whiskers and it takes four or five passes to get the trim I like.  I wish my old one hadn&#x27;t died; I had it for many many years and it was a far cry better than this.  Looking at it on-line and even in real life it looks almost identical to the old one (except is was chrome) but it is not the same.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This baby really works, is sharp, and does not let us down.  Use it often to trim up my husband&#x27;s hairline.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one to replace an earlier model and am very satisfied with this one, too. One minor drawback: the close cutting setting still isn&#x27;t close enough for me, but I think that&#x27;s more a matter of personal taste. I&#x27;m especially please by the very long time the battery (-ies?) hold(s) the charge. I can highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I looked at a number of trimmers in this and higher price ranges, coming to the conclusion this Wahl product would meet my needs and had the positive reviews to back-up my decision.  I was right.  This trimmer is powerful and versatile.  I am using it and enjoying my beard more than ever.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s powered by AA batteries, so no more charging concerns.&lt;br /&gt;1a) It&#x27;s powered by AA batteries, so no more concerns with batteries dying over time.&lt;br /&gt;2) Comes with 3 attachments, all easy to use. Give&#x27;s good length flexibility&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn&#x27;t feel too cheap. Plastic body, but some nice weight.&lt;br /&gt;4) It cuts good. It&#x27;s fast, sharp, and does the job as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) I really wanted this as a &amp;#34;close to the skin&amp;#34; type trimmer. One I could run over my face in case I didn&#x27;t have time to really shave. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not great as that. It pulls hairs a little, doesn&#x27;t get super close. Just not ideal for dry shaving on your face directly.</li>
    <li> This product made such a terrible noise when I turned it on that I have never used it on my face. Sounds like parts are rattling around in there and will break out any minute. Still have it in drawer in computer room, a lesson learned. I hated it.</li>
    <li> I quit shaving other than below my bottom lip and neck, many years ago.  Wahl&#x27;s re-chargable beard trimmer is one of the best deals online.  With the shortest cutting attachment, I only have to trim my beard about once a week, and the option to leave it plugged-in, without worrying about it overcharging, is a real bonus.</li>
