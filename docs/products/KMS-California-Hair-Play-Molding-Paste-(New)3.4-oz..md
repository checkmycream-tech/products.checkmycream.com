      <li>love a slickback look</li>
      <li>it works best with dry hair to style as needed.  </li>
      <li>Works great for my short hair.</li>
      <li>It holds very well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, which is what I need.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands of hair products gel, paste, spray, etc.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and wish it came in a smaller, travel size.  </li>

      <li>With KMS hairplay, however, it stays &amp;#34;in place&amp;#34;, but is soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>I have tried several other KMS products which I did not like, but this one is perfect for someone looking for that natural look without the hard wet look of gel.</li>
      <li>Great product feel kinda bad not buying from barber.</li>
      <li>I have been using this hair paste for a few years now &amp; it helps my hair do exactly what I want it to do.</li>
      <li>I really like how this smooths my hair and adds a little texture and smoothness but doesn&#x27;t build up.</li>
      <li>If you use too much your hair will look a little greasy.</li>

    <li> A great balance between keeping your hair hard while not making it look wet/spikey/gel-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only thing I put in my hair. Period.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t leave residue or stiffness</li>
    <li> Came just as expected, works just as expected. Great product feel kinda bad not buying from barber.</li>
    <li> I hope KMS never ever changes or stops making Hair Play. My hair would never be the same. I have short hair that has no body, no umph, does nothing- but with Hair Play I can do anything. Its 5 star hair stuff all the way!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Works very well.  I would definately buy it again.  It has great holding power - lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I love this product and wish it came in a smaller, travel size.  It holds very well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, which is what I need.</li>
    <li> Product is not what is pictured.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick like a beaver pelt, this stuff does a great job of styling without drying in to something that feels like hard plastic:)</li>
    <li> No complaints here. Love this paste! Will not buy anything else. Have used this for more than two years. The best.</li>

    <li> Excellent product! As promised, well packed too.</li>
    <li> love a slickback look</li>
    <li> I bought this  for my  son since  he  has been using  it  and  was  just  about  out; not sure  where I could purchase it locally so  bought  it  online.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best hair product I have ever used. I have tried several other KMS products which I did not like, but this one is perfect for someone looking for that natural look without the hard wet look of gel. It doesn&#x27;t leave flakes like others.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands of hair products gel, paste, spray, etc.  Hair Play was recommended to me by a new stylist I came upon when I moved. This is the best for me.  It is neither gummy nor sticky. The hold lasts all day long. The description says it all.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE!!! GREAT SERVICE!!</li>
    <li> My husband use this product for morw than 6years now. This is more like hair wax.&lt;br /&gt;Usually purchased ib hair salon fir long time, payed $23 for one...Amazon has best price so far. Happy about it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product. It is not available in my area, from any salon. A stylist who used to cut my hair used it when he cut my hair, and I started buying it. I don&#x27;t think he is even cutting hair any more, so I get my KMS online. It provides texture and hold, never flakes, and doesn&#x27;t ever feel greasy.</li>
    <li> While my wife likes my hair to be presentable, she also enjoys running her hands through it. With traditional gel or other products, my hair is sticky and stiff. With KMS hairplay, however, it stays &amp;#34;in place&amp;#34;, but is soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> I really like how this smooths my hair and adds a little texture and smoothness but doesn&#x27;t build up. This is my second bottle. I bought the last one a few years ago. This stuff lasts a long time because all you need is a little bit. If you use too much your hair will look a little greasy.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  it works best with dry hair to style as needed.  you only need a small amount to do the job.</li>
    <li> Works great for my short hair.</li>
