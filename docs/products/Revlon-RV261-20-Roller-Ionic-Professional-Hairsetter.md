<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ionic rollers smooth har as well as curl.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Love them, love how they make my hair look.</li>
    <li> I sent this back because the hard plastic rollers are not able to grip the hair.  I&#x27;ve used hot rollers many, many times but these pretty much fell out.</li>
    <li> Got this for the missus as a gift to replace her old set of hot rollers.  She&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
    <li> The rollers heat quickly and get very hot, but this is what I wanted.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there are so many of the smaller rollers.  Wish there were more large rollers and wish there were some extra large included.</li>
    <li> These curlers get very hot very quickly.  They are so hot, they have burned my fingers. I refuse to use them any longer and will be buying a new set.</li>
    <li> You would really need to ask my wife, but if she hasn&#x27;t sent them back you can bet that she likes them.</li>
    <li> Having read all reviews, I decided to try this set based on positive feedback and price. I am so thrilled with the results from my first use! My hair is shiny, has held the curl  ( even on a summer day with an outside temp of 95 and major humidity!!). My previous set was Conair Velvet rollers and they never held the curl. The plastic on that set broke immediately, I feel this Revlon hairsetter is durable and easy to use. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this item. The lid is really not attached just like the other people said. The worst thing are the pins to hold rollers on your head - they fall off very easily. Overall, I was not satisfied with the purchase and I returned it right away.</li>
    <li> Good value and good price.  I normally have a hard time with electric rollers staying in because my hair is so fine.  This set does the trick.</li>
    <li> I got these last year because I was hoping not to spend a whole lot of time on my hair but have it look ok. They work great on my medium to long fairly thick hair. They leave my hair pretty curly. Who&#x27;s idea it was to put the unattached PLASTIC cover on it??? They get hot enough, but they take a while to heat up. Overall i like them.</li>
    <li> This unit was bad in so many ways that I returned it after one try:    -There is no way of knowing how long to wait before the curlers heat up--the booklet doesn&#x27;t say and there is no way to tell on the unit itself.  -The curlers are so short that it&#x27;s almost impossible to only hold the cool end while manipulating your hair over the entire curler (there is a cool end and a very hot end to each curler)  -The metal holders do not not hold hair on the curlers  -The curlers burn the scalp  -The cover won&#x27;t stay on if the unit is shifted at all.    Soooo-\\&quot;one star\\&quot;. I would have given it \\&quot;no stars\\&quot; if that had been an option.</li>
    <li> My three daughters and I each have and use these rollers.  We have tried others and always come back to these.  Felt rollers and other clip styles don&#x27;t work near as well.  These could be a little more travel friendly, maybe a latch on the lid and retractable cord...but we just large rubberband them and make them fit in the suitcase.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> These are very hot to the touch, and unpleasant on my fingers when trying to roll my hair. They do heat up fast and my hair hold curl all day.</li>
    <li> I got these to replace a fifteen year old set that I loved!!! But it finally died. I was happy that it had the pins to hold the rollers instead of the clips becuase they hold much tighter and better. The only problem that I had is that they don&#x27;t all heat evenly. Some get extemely hot to where they burn your fingers and then others will just feel warm. They still work and the curl holds.</li>
    <li> Every time I get a new one of these, they seem just a little bit more cheaply made.  This one is virtually identical to the one I had before (though it had \\&quot;Conair,\\&quot; I think, where \\&quot;Revlon\\&quot; is now), and what happened to it was the same as what another reviewer described:  One day the back row of rollers just melted onto its posts.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised it the same thing happened to this one, too, some day, since I almost always get that smell of hot plastic when I turn it on. Also, I don&#x27;t think the rollers hold their heat as well as the old ones--and none of the plastic ones do as well as the more ceramic ones do. It&#x27;s hard to find sets with the spiked rollers rather than the flocked ones, though, which I find impossible to use.  Why is it so difficult to find well-made products?  But, so far it&#x27;s doing well enough what I bought it to do.</li>
    <li> Set is not travel friendly at all.  Clear plastic lid broke within weeks.  Also, rollers do not heat as fast as stated.  I do, however, like the design of the rollers themselves.  My fine hair doesn&#x27;t stick to the roller like some I have had.</li>
    <li> These curlers are so easy to use and will actually stay in!  The clips that come with them work great as I was a little   unsure about them. The cover is not connected at as it appears  but doesn&#x27;t outweigh the benefits of the curlers.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and sister, and they were thrilled. It seemed to work really well because they always seem to have nice hair each time I see them!</li>
    <li> These rollers work very well, even on my fine, naturally limp hair.  The little spikes ensure that the rollers stay in, and the rollers are not heavy at all.  My hair is shoulder-length and the curls I get with these rollers are great.  The lid that is not attached is annoying; that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this.  It was very reasonably priced and works great.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for close to 40 years and have never had the trouble I have had with this product.  I store my rollers in a drawer and take them out every morning to roll my shoulder length hair. Inevitably when I pick the unit up from the drawer, the plastic top which is not attached, falls off and all the curlers tumble out. Also, the clips seem inadequate for the rollers. The clips are not secure and will work their way off the curler. I have tried using the clips in every position possible because the standard way doesn&#x27;t hold the roller. However, nothing seems to help and they always pop off one by one to the floor with the roller close behind.  The curlers do their job and curl your hair if you have patience with the clips.</li>
    <li> These are great rollers. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the metal clips. They do not hold the hair too well. Otherwise the rollers heat up quick and produce nice curls. Just make sure you use hairspray!</li>
    <li> I bought these specifically for the use of an 80&#x27;s party I was throwing. I had full intention of never using them again after I purchased it. That being said, this is one of my hair styling staples now! I have waist length thick hair and these did an incredible job of giving me awesome curls. The only thing I would suggest is purchasing two sets if you have long hair. I bought two sets and I use almost all of them to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVED these rollers. No kinks in my hair and long lasting curls. However, I have owned them for some time and when I went to use them this morning, I found that the whole back row had melted into the heat box. Now that I have to replace the rollers, I am wondering if this is the brand I will buy again. The safety issue worries me.</li>
    <li> The rollers work fine but there are a few annoying factors that lead me to believe someone that has never used hot rollers designed it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) The lid is not hinged and always falls off&lt;br /&gt;b) The 3 different sized clips live in one compartment so each time I use them I have to sort them first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just little things that could easily be fixed with a more thoughtful design.</li>
    <li> This item has nowhere to hold the curlers when they are hot. there are some pins but not for the life of me do i know how to work those pins.The pins are useless. This was a total waste of my money. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!</li>
    <li> I notice that it takes a long time to heat up. Now, it doesn&#x27;t work at all! I hate the clip. Do not buy this product....</li>
    <li> I received the package with it clearly being already used and opened. Unit did not heat up even after having it on for two hours.</li>
    <li> Great for fast curling. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried these for a couple of weeks; they were very hot to hold while rolling, the pins were very tricky to use, and becasue of their small size, they made made my mediun length hair too curly.    Passed the set on to my sister who did not like them either, and have now given them to my niece who like anything that&#x27;s free:)  Wish I had tried the Conair flocked roller set instead.</li>
    <li> Great product for time saving and a nice curl set.Saves me money from the salons .It heats up quick and rollers are hot but curls are beautiful.When I want a curly look that looks like a salon do I have it all in this roller set.Can&#x27;t find this in any store</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the product! ! Came super fast,and does the job perfectly on my hair.</li>
    <li> Just perfect.  They do get hot, but for thick hair, it&#x27;s just what I like.</li>
    <li> Not good for fine hair, curlers fall right out, wish they had more of a clip that goes over curler to hold it in place</li>
    <li> Very nice! I have been using it for almost 2 years now. Late review lol</li>
    <li> I am definitely not happy with this set of rollers.  I purchased them recently because, after 20+ years with my  previous set, I was ready for something new and improved.  Well I tried them several times this week.  I find them to be slow to heat, and then unevenly heated.  Some of my medium length hair took the curl well, while other parts refused to curl.  (Maybe the rollers are defective?)  The result was a messy hairdo each time I used them, and I did try different technique/heating time each time I tried.  I don&#x27;t know, but I do know that I put them away today, and went back to my OLD curlers.  They may not be pretty, but they do the job every time.  I also want to say that the quality of the new product seems very \\&quot;junky\\&quot; to me.  The old ones are much more sturdy.  Sadly I threw all the packaging away when I opened them so now I cannot even return them.  UGH!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and need large and extra large hot rollers. This set has a lot of very small rollers. The large and medium rollers are also smaller than most sets. This set heats up very fast and will give your hair a long lasting tight curl. So if this is the type of curl you desire this set is for you. If you are looking for a loose full curl this set is not what you want.</li>
    <li> Work great good quality</li>
    <li> The rolls are very hot to handle well when you put them in your hair</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved them!</li>
    <li> I had my old set for 12 years. I was worried these would not work as well, but I was happy to find they were just as nice. The metal hooks that hold them on don&#x27;t cause creases in you hair and get hot enough to get curl in 4 minuets or so. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried because they were so cheap but there rollers are really great . They heat up quickly I lo e that the cord can wrap around the bottom of the curlers basE. The one thing I like the most they do not burn my head. My curls hold for house. I highly reckoned this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 stars because the rollers themselves work well. The design of it is just ridiculous. I have a small surface area in my bathroom. The lid is not attached to the container. So to get to the rollers I have to take the lid off and sit it aside. It ususally lays in the sink. Then the roller pins that keep them in place are all together and laying on there side in a shallow compartment. I have a large rubber band holding the lid on so when I move it from under my sink to on top of the counter the lid won&#x27;t fall off and spill everything. Otherwise, you have to use both hands when moving the container or it will pop off and spill the contents. Can&#x27;t figure out who thought this design up but they didn&#x27;t think it through for convenience sake.</li>
    <li> Hot enough for thick hair. Wish the cirlers were slightly larger though. Still very happy with product because most hot rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but once it&#x27;s heated, use the rollers quickly or you&#x27;ll burn your fingers.  It takes approximately five minutes for this unit to heat up and I usually unplug it halfway through rolling my hair because the rollers become too hot to handle.  A temperature control would have been an excellent feature.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it has enough of each size roller and it was just what I needed</li>
    <li> Take it from someone who knows! I have used electric rollers for over 40 years and these are great. For new users of electric rollers or those who didn&#x27;t know...You Definitely have to use a Heat Set Spray! Just use a light mist on your hair as you put each roller in. I use Tressemme, there is a huge difference as curls will last all day using it, especially if you have fine hair! I like the \\&quot;all\\&quot; plastic rollers and the fact that they are recessed in the unit is cool. Great price too, as I bought this same unit 6 months ago at a store and paid way more, so when I decided I needed a second set I turned to Amazon to buy them. Really glad I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before but decided to give them a try after my hairstylist recommended it.  I tried to find some inexpensive basic rollers, but I remained skeptical that anything would really work on my long and very thick hair.  After some initial frustration, I was pleasantly surprised - my hair looked fantastic!  20 rollers was just enough to get all my hair and give it curls and nice volume without looking like an 80s flashback.  A blast of hot and then cold with the hairdryer also helped set the curls before taking out the rollers.    Pros: Great basic rollers, really get the job done, and I had no trouble getting the clips to hold them up.    Cons: Lid not hinged, and no timer or any instructions anywhere to tell you how long these need to really heat up.  Through some practice, I&#x27;ve found 15 minutes works for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  The rollers are VERY HOT.  I have to remove them from the appliance 30 seconds before I use them to avoid singeing my hair or burning my scalp. One time I mistakenly inserted the curler in the appliance incorrectly and the curler melted. Just a warning! I put up with the heating problems because the  curlers are lighter weight than some others I have tried and the only ones that stay in my fine hair without getting tangled. I also like the variety of curler sizes.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning before work. The only problem some of the rollers are hotter than others. Some rollers slip right onto the holder and others you have to push onto the holder. All in all it&#x27;s a pretty good one. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> The metal holders do not hold the rollers in hair very well.  I did see that remark in previous ratings so was not surprised.  I am keeping the hair setter as it is better than having to leave  regular rollers in my hair for hours.</li>
    <li> I like them, they heat up very quickly!</li>
    <li> Love the Revlon RV261 Ionic Professional Hairsetter. It is everything I need or expect from a hot roller set. The rollers are easy to handle and don&#x27;t burn my hands while using them. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Having owned my first &amp; only Hot Roller set for about 5 years, I was very impressed after using the Revlon RV261 Hot Rollers.  My hair is very fine, with little or no curl retention, using this set my curls are smooth, and hold up very well. Easy to use, heats up within 10 minutes or less.</li>
    <li> Good price for the product.  They heat up quickly.  As other people stated, the curler pins are not very good.  With the older type, you could bend them so that there would be a tighter fit and your curler would not fall out.  You can&#x27;t do that with the new pins.  Luckily I had the older type that I now use.  The heating rods are now square.  Don&#x27;t know why Revlon  didn&#x27;t leave them round.  Now you have to twist the curler around until you get it just right for it to fit back on the post.  Kind of time consuming if you are in a rush.  It would have been nice if the lid was hinged for when you travel.  Hopefully I can rap the cord around it and keep everything from falling out in my suitcase.  Over all it does a good job on curling my hair.  My hair is very thick and the weight of it pulls the curl out pretty quickly.  My hair stayed curled most of the day.  Will know more this summer in hot weather.  It was packaged well and arrived on time.  I gave them 4 stars because of the pins.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. They take a good 10 min to heat up, and they aren&#x27;t too hot to handle. I also like how the rollers have little teeth on them instead of velvet. It makes them stay on your hair better. The storage compartment is too small to hold the pins, but I just keep them in the plastic bag they came in and then I separate them by size on my counter when I&#x27;m ready to use them. I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is that the lid isn&#x27;t attached. You just take it off when you use them and put it back on when you store them. It&#x27;s not like the rollers would fall out anyways. They snap down onto each metal prong. When I travel, I just wrap the cord around the middle to keep the lid on. I also love how you can leave these plugged in because it has an on/off switch. Overall, I think these are great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never taken the time to write a review but since I bought these based on all the positive reviews I had to add my two cents. The rollers are not hot, at all. After letting them heat up for over 25 minutes I could still touch them with no issue. In addition, these are clearly for people with hair closer to 4 inches long as my shoulder length hair was too much to handle and the pins literally shot across the bathroom several times. I have already requested a return from Amazon. Don&#x27;t go through this hassle.</li>
    <li> Totally what I expected and needed to spice things up from time to time.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> i like this product. except that the plastic top is not hinged or connected to the bottom and falls off easily, spilling the curlers every which way. very annoying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving my set. I have long hair that works best with hot rollers, but I&#x27;m very particular about the style which I&#x27;ve had trouble locating in local stores now. I like a hard surface, not velvet, as that allows me to smoothly tuck in my ends. I like these style of clips, which leave the least amount of marks (but there is a bit of technique to it). I purchased this about six months to replace an almost identical set that lasted nearly a decade. Unfortunately, my new one stopped heating up and I was about to count it as a loss. I tried contacting customer service on a chance and, after being redirected to Helen of Troy (which licenses the Revlon name) one of their representatives promptly arranged for a replacement set shipped to me which I am now enjoying.</li>
    <li> This is a great little hairsetter.  I agree with the other reviews, though, that the lid drives me crazy.  It is a two handed operation to move it around.  It curls my hair very well without any products on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to find a replacement for my Remington wax core curlers that I&#x27;ve had for years. They finally gave out when I was in London and didn&#x27;t use a transformer. My bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is a bit bulky, but it does the job! I need something that gets REALLY hot, retains heat well, and has enough curlers for all my hair. While I wish it heat up a bit quicker, I can&#x27;t complain as they get super super hot! They also keep the heat for a long time, which I need for my coarser, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a few more curlers, but I&#x27;ll live. I hate the tiny curlers (6 total) as they are teeny tiny and don&#x27;t get super hot (or mb I just can&#x27;t tell since they&#x27;re so small in width). I do wish the set were packaged a bit more compactly. Also, the roller sizes are very specific for each: the bottoms of the rollers have a horizontal slot so they only fit in specific spots and the openings are set for very specific roller sizes! A bit of a nuisance for me, but most roller sets have something similar where the big rollers fit in specific places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a solid curler set that heats up in 15min (for the temp I want), gets uber hot, and retains heat. I&#x27;ve had them about a month now so far and am pretty pleased.</li>
    <li> These are great hot rollers! I do wish it had more large rollers. And I would recommend buying some generic clips to use with the rollers instead of the pins they provide.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this product is so bad, I felt obligated.  Admittedly when I first got these rollers about a month ago they worked great.  But now, only one month later, they don&#x27;t heat up at all!!  Absolutely cold no matter how long I leave them turned on to heat!  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I bought these hot curlers to replace my 12 year old set that was well used and one day didn&#x27;t heat up. The price on these hot rollers was less than the others Amazon offered so it&#x27;s a good buy but I don&#x27;t like them as well as the previous ones I had. The spot that holds the metal clips is not big enough and so is not really usable. The rollers do get very very hot - hotter than my previous set in fact I burned my finger and got a blister putting a curler in my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and I have tried a lot, and am very satisfied with this.  Curls hair fast.</li>
    <li> Revlon has always had great Rollers !! I want the ones we had in the 80S so bad. Wish they still made them .... But these are Good ...</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews on several other hot roller sets so I really was skeptical about buying these.  I was pleasantly surprised, however.  Even though I would like a case that is more travel friendly, I would make the extra space in my suitcase for these.  The rollers took only one time for me to get used to using them.  They are a bit hot on the ends, and i could use about 5 to 7 more rollers, but overall they work well and the curls come out shiny and bouncy.</li>
    <li> Ordered the rollers  in Dec. Loved them at first.  Noticed that they were losing heat as time went on.  Come March getting ready to go out for my Birthday, turned on the rollers, blew dry my hair, went to roll my hair and the rollers were stone cold. Power was on. tried plugging it in to a different power sorce.  and nothing... Tried them a few times after that and still nothing.     I guess you get what you pay for.     They were only 20 something.  But I know I&#x27;m going to stay away from Revlon on my next purchase.          Joan in Pa</li>
    <li> Best on the  market...the flocked hot rollers, in addition to the fact they create static electricity in your hair, simply don&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn fingers while putting rollers in hair.  Like others, I wish the cover was hinged and the storage for the clips is not very good.  Overall, however, it does a good job.</li>
    <li> This one replaces one just like my old one.  It is great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I wanted a roller set with an on/off switch; I was tired of crawling under my dressing table to plug my rollers in every morning. Well, this set works ok, and it does have a switch---but it also has a completely detached plastic lid. Whose idea was that? I am ready to either throw it away or duct-tape it so it simply flips up. I do not need the minor daily irritation of dealing with this separate part. And here&#x27;s another brilliant idea: how about a clip storage that actually works? There are three different sizes of clips wth this set, and the genius designers decided they&#x27;d all fit into a single little horizontal channel in the front. There&#x27;s no way to keep them separate, and they don&#x27;t actually even fit in there if you do try to use it. I keep my clips in a little velvet bag (yes, another item to keep track of). What a piece of junk. I wish somebody had included this info in a review---I never would have purchased these stupid rollers.</li>
    <li> I agree with the last review.  The lid is useless, and thanks for the idea of using duct tape to keep it on.  I put the pins in my drawer because the itty bitty slot they give you for 20+ pins is too small and when you want one they all come out in a tangle.  I like the rollers and they heat up fast and hot enough.  I have long (waist length), thick hair and I get a nice curl, so I give it two stars for that.</li>
    <li> The problem with this hairsetter is that it absolutely gets TOO hot. &lt;br /&gt;I love the style, and the curlers, but I have to wear cotton gloves to use this.</li>
    <li> Met all expectations!  Just like the good old days. Can not find these in any brick and mortar store.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have long hair down to about the middle of my back and have owned many different sets of electric rollers.  They are great in that I can set my hair and once my make-up is on, I can remove them and style my hair. So for me they are much preferred over a curling iron where you get no fulness.  The Revlon RV261 heats up fairly quickly, seems to be gentle to my hair, pins are preferred to the plastic clips of most electric rollers, and my curls last.  Yes, I would difinitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> Like the pins used to hold the curlers in.Heats up fast.  Works realoy well with my layered hair which most don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This roller set is the typical hairsetter.  I like the lid coming off completely.  The clips are a little thin--I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving them in the opening while the curlers are heating up.</li>
    <li> The thing I dont like about these rollers is that they get too hot to handle. They also don&#x27;t seem to hold a set as well as my old rollers did.</li>
    <li> My only complaint which I am sure has been echoed by many is I wish the lid was attached.  Other than that I find this to be quality product for the price range it is in.</li>
    <li> I have two sets of these. One I keep at home and the other set I am keeping at my vacation home.</li>
    <li> I love the rollers and they work great on my hair,</li>
    <li> These hot rollers are easy to use.  They heat up quickly. They have an off/on switch which I love.  The lid is easy to take off and on.  The clips hold the rollers securely in my hair.  My only complaint is the holder for the clips is not large enough to hold the clips properly. This is not enough of a reason in my opinion to not purchase these rollers.</li>
    <li> I have short hair. This is perfect for giving me volume. I can&#x27;t wait to use this for curls when my hair grows longer</li>
    <li> The hot rollers were  very nice BUT they slipped off of my hair. Now, I have rather thin hair and maybe&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t put enough hair on each roller.  They heated very well - I&#x27;ll try again.</li>
    <li> These have worked really well every time I&#x27;ve used them.  I did read the rest of the reviews and did take to heart the smell.  I got these for my wedding day so we tried them out three or four times before the big day and by the second half of the third try, no smell!  The smell doesn&#x27;t transfer or anything, it&#x27;s just mildly unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers work great, they didn&#x27;t even need to sit as long in my hair as I had assumed they would.  The curls stayed and were shiny and bouncy.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems using the pins to get these to stay in my hair, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real down side I&#x27;ve encountered is the top that goes on the set.  It fits on just fine but that&#x27;s about it, the top doesn&#x27;t secure at all and there&#x27;s no secure way to put the pins in.  This thing has been lightly bumped enough times that I&#x27;ve given up on storing the pins in the actual box and I&#x27;ve stored them elsewhere and put the box as low to the ground as possible so that I don&#x27;t have to pick up all the rollers again-- it gets tedious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I haven&#x27;t run into any issues with these!</li>
    <li> Thought I could get a quick fix for curling my hair, but these fell right out, they didn&#x27;t stay in my hair and it is not super&lt;br /&gt;short. Took some time to heat up also. Back to the curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite hot curler set.  My last one finally died after years of daily use and I didn&#x27;t want to wait while something was shipped to me, so I actually went shopping and bought another brand as a replacement.  What a mistake!  I tried it once and returned it.  Then I ordered the Revlon Professional and admitted I&#x27;d learned my lesson.  I love this set because it heats up fast, and produces lasting curls.  Yes, the rollers DO get hot - but that&#x27;s the whole point isn&#x27;t it?  Besides, they have cool edges that let you put them in, so no problem.  The nubs on the rollers help hold them in your hair, and they don&#x27;t tangle as you take the curlers out.  (And I have very long hair, so if they were going to tangle they&#x27;d tangle in mine.)  Plus the thin metal clips do NOT leave crimps in your hair like the clunky fit-over-the-entire-curler clips do.  (And I don&#x27;t care WHAT the advertising says, those thingsZ DO leave crimps.)  Yes, the lid is not hinged, but that&#x27;s kind of good because it doesn&#x27;t keep slamming down on your unsuspecting hand as you reach in for a roller.  You just lift it off and set it aside.  When you&#x27;re done you put it back on.  Slick.  It has an on/off switch with a red light that lets you know when it&#x27;s on.  It&#x27;s reasonably light weight and narrow enough to fit on most bathroom vanities.  And it lasts forever.  Well, at least a long time...my last one lasted for YEARS.  What more could you ask for in a hot curler set?  My advice?  Stop shopping - just go buy a Revlon Professional.  (you can thank me later...)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to get a perm because my hair is very fine and burns easily  this gives me curls without burning it</li>
    <li> Anyone who wears LFW (HH or Syn Heat Resistant) this will be your new best friend for styling. For the heat resistant  hairs, be ready to be wowed!!! Will give you your shine and bounce back with your hair.  You will simply love this!!! Also good for those Frizzy ends</li>
    <li> Thank you Revlon for still making hot rollers that come in 3 various sizes and do NOT have velvet covering. I have previously had velvet covered hot rollers and was extremely disappointed because the velvet started peeling off after normal use. Years ago I had a set of hot rollers similar to these and they just went out after constant use. I have naturally straight hair with no texture and the only way my hair will hold a curl is with hot rollers. I agree with some of the other posts that they do take about 10 minutes or a little longer to warm up but waiting that long is worth the excellent results I get with my hair. I wish that there were more of these because hot rollers of this type are becoming scarce. I recommend this product to anyone who used to and still uses and loves plastic hot rollers from way back and is looking to replace or update their current set. The package and product arrived with no damage. thank you</li>
    <li> I received the hairsetter in good condition.  I use the hairsetter every two day and am very pleased with the performance of the product.  It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get too hot or dry out my hair.  Yes I am a satisfied customer.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Very good easy to use makes my hair have volume and strong. My hair used to fall out but since stayed strong</li>
    <li> Rollers do not get as hot as they need to; curls don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Great item easy to use and gave me hair awesome bounce love it you needed one of these shipped quickly too.</li>
    <li> Item not as described, the curlers are of  poor quality and they intermittently/barely work.  Overall a terrible product for the price. ( even if it was free it&#x27;s a terrible product)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. Clips doesn&#x27;t hold the rollers. Takes forever for the rollers to get heated. It&#x27;s not worth it</li>
    <li> It works great and she likes the different size rollers as well as the sleek design and pretty color it comes in. The price was also very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This roller curler works just fine.  I have one complaint.  My previous hot curlers, (Clairol) had longer clips.  Your clips for the Revlon curler doesn&#x27;t always hold the curlers in place.  Fortunately I saved my clips from my previous curlers and they work fine.  They are approximatelly 1/2 inch longer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Overall good quality &amp; value.  I could do without the 4 small rollers.  Maybe the could be replaced with 2 more medium size rollers.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 5 star because the rollers get hot and curls your hair in minutes. Well 10 to 15 minutes tops, excellent product. The only thing rhey don&#x27;t give enough of the pins for the smaller size rollers.</li>
    <li> Curlers were still to hot to handle. Thanks</li>
    <li> Like the curls it produces</li>
    <li> These hot curlers do not work as well as my old (1995) one did. I guess it is the new workmanship!</li>
    <li> the hairsetter worked pretty good except it doesn&#x27;t hold hair as tight as I would of liked. you need to have the knobby circles all around the curler instead of the straight ridges. It would hold the hair in place a lot better. this was the only problem I had with the hairsetter.</li>
    <li> love this except the clips are hard to get to stay in and the curlers need to reheat longer than I have patience for .But it is really a good first choice if your girls are learning to curl their hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement to my burned out unit.  This one was similar to a Clairol set I had for about 20 years and used daily.  It does set hair, but this new set is too hot to use. My thumbs and fingers hurt as I type.  The rollers were too hot to keep comfortably in my hair.  I may have gotten a lemon, but I am not willing to try another set.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I was sceptical after reading the reviews but it heats up just fine, all the clips fit in the space provided and with regards to the unattached top... I just pick it up from the bottom, and guess what... nothing falls out. I just wish it had extra large rollers...</li>
    <li> plug it in and in no time you are ready to roll your hair... just what I needed a great price too</li>
    <li> Just like my old one and works wonderful.  Thank you so much for having it in stock&lt;br /&gt;Joanne Brecunier</li>
    <li> I CHOSE THIS SETTER BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST LIKE THE OLDER SETTERS.  SIMILAR TO THE SETTER CLAIROL USED TO MAKE.  I PREFER THESE TYPE OF ROLLERS TO THE VELVET ONES BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF THICK CORSE HAIR AND THESE ROLLERS GRIP AND HOLD THE HAIR BETTER.  AS A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL I  HAVE USED SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF SETTERS BUT THIS KIND WORKS BEST.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. item is as described.</li>
    <li> Used electric rollers many years ago and decided to try using them again.....these are great....rollers heat up fast....and curls last.</li>
    <li> It is nice for a quick curl situation.... the pins don&#x27;t stay in the little container very easily and the top never stays on.</li>
    <li> My first set of hot rollers. Work great. Stick straight hair now has luxurious curls. I am more than pleased.</li>
    <li> I found the pins did not give a tight hold to the curlers. Otherwise the product does what it says it will do - curl your hair.</li>
    <li> These rollers worked extremely well. The lack of a star is due to how long it took to really warm up. Other than that, they did the job! People complain about how hot they are to handle, but their only job is to get hot, roll fast and it&#x27;s not much of an issue. I&#x27;d recommend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> These curlers do not get hot enough and the clips do not hold the curlers in place and the lid does not stay on.</li>
    <li> The rollers are a great price and work well.  This is my second set.  My first set lasted several years.  I would recommend the roller set.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as a present. It&#x27;s very easy to use and makes nice curls in different sizes. It has a little burnt smell when curls are in the case getting warm. Don&#x27;t be scared. I tried it on for myself and they didn&#x27;t burn my hair. I Recommend it. Will update if found any flaws.</li>
    <li> As yet we have been unable to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;It is 110 volts and nothing on the packaging or your advertising to say this.&lt;br /&gt;European uses should be warned about the voltage difference, we have had to order a voltage reducer from the States, I tried Amazon but at the time you could not help.&lt;br /&gt;There should be warning on the advert and packaging re the need to use a voltage reducer!</li>
    <li> If I could give it no stars, I would. This set gets way to hot and burns your fingers, the clips don&#x27;t hold the rollers in place and it takes forever to heat up. If it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle, I&#x27;d be returning and purchasing a different brand.</li>
    <li> this is ok, but the best part is the number of rollers this has.  Great for lots of curls.  but they don&#x27;t stay hot for long.</li>
    <li> I like this set because there is an On/Off switch, the top comes off and they are light weight. They heat up in average time and don&#x27;t get so hot to burn fingers or hair. I have shoulder length, tinted, fine hair and have to be careful with using hot rollers or curling irons. I don&#x27;t want to damage or fry my hair, these are perfect especially with the Ionic Technology. I ordered the Vented roller clamps to use with these, I have them in my hair now as I type this.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 sets of these rollers which had stopped getting hot. I like them so much I decided to try another set. The new set does not get extremely hot like the last set I purchased--which is fine with me!! If I need more larger rollers I just use the ones from the previous set. It does a great job on my hair!!</li>
    <li> I received the item on time, which is great.  However, the clips / curlers aren&#x27;t very easy to use in the sense that it&#x27;s unclear how to clip the curlers into your hair securely.  They fall out easily and you burn your fingers in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have thick hair that&#x27;s very long, and what I could manage to get to stay in the curler did hold a curl for a few hours after using these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of hot rollers- I have really long hair and it can be really time consuming to blow-dry and curl my hair.  I was worried that my curls wouldn&#x27;t hold as well.  These heat up in the time it takes me to brush and separate my hair, the clips fit really well, and the different sizes are perfect to hold long layered hair.  These didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; on my hair when I took them out as much as other rollers I have tried.  These are definitely worth it for the price-- they are effective but I don&#x27;t use them often enough to justify the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> The curlers get VERY hot, even the ends. It does have a great variety of sizes and more than enough curlers to do the job. It also heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> easy to use and i love the biggest rollers. made my hair shining and smoothly and only takes 10mints in the morning! and also really good deal!</li>
    <li> I searched everywhere for the Revlon RV261 Ionic Professional Hairsetter to no avail. I desided to check with Amazon.com and there it was.  I was delighted.  I placed my order and it was delivered within a week.  Such great service!  My future shpping will be with Amazon.  Thank you.  Lois Driscoll</li>
    <li> Thumbs up :)  My sister in law loves it.  And it was well packaged, shipped fast, and works great!  Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Having had \\&quot;hot\\&quot; rollers in the 1960&#x27;s, I thought I would give these a try.  They worked beautifully.  My only problem was how hot they were to the touch. Heated quickly and did not get tangled in my hair which was a big plus for me.  Great time saver.</li>
    <li> Works well and is as good or better than more expensive ones.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it and use it often.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this hot curler set again.  The rollers don&#x27;t stay in my hair, they slip out too easily.  The rollers burn my fingers every time I try to use them. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This set was better than the reviews I read and I purchased it because of the brand name and quality associated with it. It heated up quickly and the assortment of sizes was perfect for a person with long hair thicker than mine. I purchased it on a whim (and I am not sorry because drug store sets of the same size were not easy to use esp. the clips) as I wanted to grow my hair long one last time for fun plus due to unforeseen circumstances I was unable to visit the salon for my usual color and cut.. I had trouble getting the rollers to stay where I wanted, not because of them but because of the stage of hair growth and thickness. I only used the set once and the results even with my hair were acceptable. I plan on giving the set to someone or donating it to a good cause; on a humorous note it reinforced the fact long hair is not for me as it was in my younger years and my salon and hairdresser are going to have fun watching me go from &#x27;haggy&#x27; long and grey to short, natural light brown and stylish appearance with my ego and self image exponentially increasing.  On many fronts this was a good investment and the service of the vendor was top notch and spot on as advertised when ordered; definitely would recommend this to those with appropriate length and thickness of hair.

    <li> I have used these rollers for about 8 years now. I just bought a second set so I can leave one at my parents&#x27; house in MO for visits and one for my home in AZ. I love &#x27;em so much that I want to bring them on all my vacations! I have fine, blonde, long (middle of the back) curly hair and use these for softer curls. My hot roller curls last all night and sometimes the next day....and I only use Sheer Blonde Hairspray (not even super strong!). I would recommend these to anyone. If you leave them in your hair until completely cooled, the tighter the curl. I usually use hairspray before putting the rollers in. Once all the rollers are in, I do another round of spray. I take the rollers out, do a small spritz, flip my hair over my head, toussle the curls, spray the underneath, flip back, shape, then spray one last time. My curls with these rollers have lasted through all-night dancing and weddings.</li>
    <li> I have not owned &amp;#34;hot curlers&amp;#34; since the late 90&#x27;s.  I decided to try them again, and I love them.  It is fairly new and I have only used a few times, but so far so good.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, so maybe I have to give it a few more go&#x27;s.  But the first try it had a horrible plastic burning smell that I could not debunk.  I&#x27;m hoping it was because it was new, so we&#x27;ll see if it goes away.  I was also praying it wouldn&#x27;t catch on fire....Maybe I was a little impatient and in a hurry, but the first try didn&#x27;t hold my curls that well either.  I have naturally stick straight hair, and I used plenty of hair spray and even did the &amp;#34;second day curl&amp;#34; thing.  Like I said, maybe I was in a hurry so I&#x27;ll be trying it again soon.</li>
    <li> Buy was good value and came quickly. Rollers wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair but not rollers fault, will be good when hair grows a little ,ore</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t stay in my hair too well.  What I do like is it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair like the old style hot rollers.  I guess if I had really long hair it they might stay in my hair better.</li>
    <li> ....and that means it&#x27;s good enough for me.  It wasn&#x27;t exactly like she wanted--hence the four stars--but it seems to work pretty well.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Ummm...I was very surprised when I got this item. Instead of clip-ons, these curlers have metal pins that are supposed to hold your hair and the curler in place. This redicilous idea does not work - the pins can&#x27;t hold a heavy plastic curler! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money b</li>
    <li> I was disappointed as the curlers came with pins to secure and the picture on my screen when I was doing a search for curlers showed that plastic clips held the curlers in place.  I would like to know how to order some clips even if I had to pay extra.  Jane Sackrison</li>
    <li> The rollers are OK however the clips included do not fit the rollers.  I had to replace them with my own which shouldn&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
    <li> This unit is what I expected.  It is doing a good job setting my wife&#x27;s hair. Not only that but the Revlon travels well.  We just returned from a long trip by air and the unit was strong enough to be packed lightly in the suit case and survived with out damage.</li>
    <li> It had been many years since I had used electric rollers.  I like the fact that these heat up very quickly, and hold the heat, but I have a hard time getting them to stay in with the metal clips.  Maybe my hair is not long enough (chin length), but I plan to try another brand with a different system of securing the rollers.</li>
    <li> These are the hair rollers I remember from the 80s, but better!  They heat up relatively quickly, about 10 minutes.  I mostly use the large and medium in conjuction with another set of JUMBO rollers since I have long hair.  Adding in the medium sized gives my hair more body than just the jumbo rollers alone.  They do get really hot.  I have had to use facial tissue between the curler and my skin to not get burned on the neck.  I have enough hair elsewhere to insulate my scalp.  Just something to be aware of.  The lid is detached, so when you pick them up to move them you will likely drop them a time or two, if you&#x27;re not paying attention.  As with all hot rollers, remember to let the curlers cool completely before removing from your hair, and then let hair rest another 10 minutes before styling.  I just finger style though.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the roller however, they come with pin clips instead of the plastic roller claps which hold the rollers in place much better... thank God I still had my old one&#x27;s... now they work wonderful for ME</li>
    <li> my wife loves her curlers she needed them and was unsure at first but loves them she uses them all the time</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get these to stay in my hair. Part of the reason was that, as other reviewers stated, they&#x27;re hot and hard to handle, but even after I figured out a way to get them in and put the pins on, they always fell right out.  I have fine, medium-short hair; they might work for someone with thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> I have old curler sets from the flocked to the grippy ones.  I couldn&#x27;t find clips for either of those sets, so I thought I&#x27;d order a new, fresh set with clips.  Great move.  However, I now have ordered gloves to wear when using this set because they are so hot.  The edges of the rollers are set to be cool (as is said in the descriptions) which is good, in concept.  However, in use, the body is truly too hot to handle when wrapping my past shoulder-length hair around the rollers.  I get great curl and volume, so I do love them.  I&#x27;m just warning future purchasers that they may want to initially also order hot gloves.  I saw other reviewers weren&#x27;t happy with the detatched lid.  It helps me remember to keep the lid off when heating so the rollers don&#x27;t get toooooo hot.  Just wrap the cord gently around the lid and rollers and the lid stays on for storage (when cooled, of course).</li>
    <li> Curlers are VERY HOT to the touch...and I am not all that sensitive to heat.  However, they sure do make a beautiful curl!</li>
    <li> I really like these rollers.  They get hot enough to give my hair a good curl but not so hot that I can&#x27;t handle them.  Love that it comes with so many rollers in varying sizes.  The lid isn&#x27;t the best design but it wasn&#x27;t enough of an issue to keep me from liking the product in general.  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for an easy solution to get some curl and volume in your hair.</li>
    <li> They do get hot and are helpful with curls. However, I feel that the secure pins could be better .</li>
    <li> This set of rollers heats up quickly!  I burned myself a couple of times on a hot end, but my hair definitely held the curl well after only a few minutes in the rollers.</li>
    <li> This is an old model but I love the results. Most new sets don&#x27;t hold onto your hair but this does..</li>
    <li> When I was reading all the reviews, I almost didn&#x27;t want to buy this unit.  I decided to give it a chance anyways, because it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and it was recommended by a website for thin hair.  Even if it turns out bad, I could live with a loss of 20 dollars rather than 40 or 50 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving this baby a couple tries, I wanted to write a good review to do it justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair, which used to be fine but has been slightly damaged lately.  So how your hair reacts to a set of hot rollers really depends on the type of your hair.  I think I got lucky with this set.  It&#x27;s hard for my hair to hold a curl, and I&#x27;m not very good with curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I can&#x27;t complain.  My curls turn out great and they last almost all day. I mean, of course, most of them fall out of them by the end of the day.  Any curls would.  I don&#x27;t use any hair products except heat protection &amp; hair shine.  I use toilet paper as end papers, so I don&#x27;t have any frizz at the end.  The rolls do get kind of hot, but they shouldn&#x27;t burn your fingers if you know what your you&#x27;re doing.  You&#x27;re not supposed to let your finger touch the rolls for too long.  Quickly wrap your hair around the rolls to reduce the time your fingers having direct contact with the rolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point here is, this unit works great.  How your curls turn out has a lot to do with how you roll them.  If you&#x27;re new at this, spend sometime practicing.  The clips could be better, but they still work.  They do hold your rolls up, just got to find the spot.  The reviews made the clips sound horrifying.  They&#x27;re not.  The hold the rolls up just fine.  Again, it all comes down to learning curve.</li>
    <li> Used this product for less than 6 months, and the middle section of the unit no longer heats up.  My previous hot roller had been used for over 5 years!  Too bad I can no longer return it -- I certainly would.</li>
    <li> I use these almost every day and they seem to be holding up well. Time will tell if they actually last</li>
    <li> The back two rows of curlers were significantly cooler than the front row. Did not use the clips included - bought plastic clamps which worked much better.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t one I would recommend though it did come highly recommended to me.  It doesn&#x27;t put good curl into my hair nor does it hold.  I do have very long hair so that could be part of the problem.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t worry, it really doesn&#x27;t look purple--more two-tone gray and the top tier has a tinge of color!  I researched several products before purchasing online and found this suited my needs best.  Lots of curlers included in multiple sizes--though with my very fine, medium length hair, I do not use the largest. Heats quickly but roller rims stay cool!  Picks hold hair on roller well--not perfectly with my fine hair so I sometimes add 1-2 from an old set.  Cover come off completely so is not &amp;#34;in the way&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t use it at all unless traveling.  I thought that putting slotted rollers on the posts would be a pain, but they actually turn themselves if you get them anywhere close!  My one complaint, I suppose, is the large length--but still fits in drawer horizontally and vertically (which is important with soft-close mechanism making drawer shallower).</li>
    <li> I am loving my hot rollers.  It&#x27;s my first time using them and they leave my hair shinny and it does the job quickly</li>
    <li> the curlers are fine but the cover is not connected to the base. Every time you move the base the pins you place in your hair to hold the rollers in place fall over the floor. I ended up donating the entire thing to a thrift store and bought one that the lid is connected. It is annoying to travel with this thing or just put it out of the way so it isn&#x27;t always sitting on your bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Not the best designed electric curlers but at least they have teeth that somewhat grip my hair.</li>
    <li> Gets really hot, works well on my very long thick hair.</li>
    <li> I hate the velvet rollers, they stick to my hair and are a mess. Not only do these heat up faster, hold better, and release my hair easier but they are super easy to clean and maintain. Hair spray build up? Just use a damp cloth to wipe these rollers off. My hair is very long (20+ inches) and very thick, so I use all 20 rollers at once and have never ended up with imperfect curls. I would never buy another type of roller...ever! These are perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my first set of hot rollers, but I had tried out a set from a friend before. I was initially worried that the pins would be difficult to use based on others&#x27; reviews. I have shoulder length, fine hair and the pins work really well as long as I have enough hair wound on each roller. The pins are actually ideal because they don&#x27;t leave a dent the way other roller sets I&#x27;ve tried did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a set of clips (the kind with separate teeth) just in case but haven&#x27;t had to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid just kind of perches on top, it doesn&#x27;t latch on, so that&#x27;s a bit inconvenient but not a deal breaker. I don&#x27;t use these rollers everyday but I think I easily could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, a good buy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product is absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived the top had already snapped off and I have yet to figure out how to snap it back on.&lt;br /&gt;There is no way to indicate when the rollers are ready - you have to guess.&lt;br /&gt;The clips don&#x27;t work - they don&#x27;t grab the rollers and, if you move, they fall off and fly across the room.&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that Revlon is selling such an inferior product.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do, so I ordered a Conair Hair Setter to replace it.  The conair Hair setter is a much better product.</li>
    <li> Got them for my mom for Christmas she loves them! Very good rollers! They do a good job and her hairs really curly</li>
    <li> These warm up quickly and hold the hair without falling out.I&#x27;ve tried others with the clips but it&#x27;s hard to get those clips in between each roller- the wire one&#x27;s in this set just glide in and don&#x27;t tangle.Nice assortment of sizes too.</li>
    <li> This product did not curl my hair at all. I would not recommend it. I wish I had returned it, but I waited too long.</li>
    <li> my wife had a similar set but lost parts.  this is just what she wanted</li>
    <li> I really love these rollers my curls stayed in all day very pleased with the results!!!</li>
    <li> I researched which heating curlers were best and found &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; got the best reviews.  Then I looked for price and quality.  These Revlon heating curlers are great. Fast heat up; easy to use clips;  fast results on hair. Leave mine in for 3 minutes when I want loose curls and 6 minutes for tight curls;  of course it depends on your hair. I can put these in my hair without looking in a mirror and I still get great results.</li>
    <li> The only thing I did not like about this product was the first time I went to use these rollers one of the small rollers actually fell completely apart. I need to call the company and let them know.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the metal clips😒</li>
    <li> Sent it back. Clips kept flying off. I used the proper clip for the size. It reminded me if one I had in the &#x27;70&#x27;s</li>
    <li> in the beginning it worked great...but it was very very hot in fact I got a blister on my thumb from it. After two weeks it all of a sudden quit heating up...don&#x27;t know what happened but Amazon is shipping me another one. lets see if this one is better.</li>
    <li> I bought this set six year ago and just now it is not heating up as much as it should.  Before that, It heated up really hot, and I had to turn it off after 7 minutes while I WAS setting my hair.  There are just enough rollers to do my hair, and I never lost a clip in all these years.  So I am now ordering another one to replace the old one.  I would strongly recommend anyone to buy this set.&lt;br /&gt;Signed, Cindy Bolduc, Kissimmee, FL</li>
    <li> I received my Revlon hairsetter  around  2/6/14. I was happy to find  a hairsetter similar to the one I was use to using and it worked very well for me until this week when it would not get hot. I know appliances are not meant to last forever but I think it should have lasted longer than 7 months. I have had others that did. Based on the longevity of this Revlon product  I probably won&#x27;t buy another Revlon appliance.</li>
    <li> I had hot rollers when I was younger and I loved them. Unfortunately with the price of these I should have known that it was too good to be true. They smell HORRIBLE when you plug them in I&#x27;ve used (or attempted to use them) four times and the smell has not gone away. These curls don&#x27;t stay and they are small so if you have hair to your shoulders or longer I wouldn&#x27;t purchase.</li>
    <li> Always looking for this set with gripper teeth for quick hair styles. Off-On button and 3 sizes. Best roller set.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good set of curlers at a reasonable price for a while, these are just that! My hair is a bit past my shoulders and usually will not hold a curl for any length of time over an hour. But the first time I used these, even after I brushed out my hair later that day, my hair stayed relatively styled. I did not leave them in very long as I usually also have trouble with my hair sort of poofing out for a while after I curl it if I leave anything in for more than a few minutes, but again, not the case with these, I had soft curls all day, even right after I took the rollers out. So I&#x27;m looking forward to really being able to use these and not completely frying my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why there are so many negative reviews for these rollers -they work great for me and I love them.    \\&quot;too hot\\&quot; - well, they are hot rollers, so they&#x27;re going to be hot.  Because, you know...science.    \\&quot;lid not attached\\&quot; - seriously?  That&#x27;s not worth complaining about.  Are you a child?  Can you not carry things?  Then you shouldn&#x27;t use these without adult supervision anyway.    \\&quot;clips don&#x27;t fit in pocket\\&quot; - yes they do.  That pocket was made specifically for those clips.    \\&quot;curls don&#x27;t hold\\&quot; - did you take the rollers out as soon as you put them in?    Anyhow...My hair looks awesome.</li>
    <li> The top comes off and I regularly have them all fall out, otherwise it is great but this is a HUGE downside if you store them and pull them out.</li>
    <li> Does not heat up as well as I thought it should.</li>
    <li> These did not stay in my hair</li>
    <li> Love these and they always leave a nice curl</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Very happy to finally find rollers that are NOT flocked.</li>
    <li> Not really interested in this product. But it has worked well for others, so please don&#x27;t neglect it purchase it. My friend says it works for her.</li>
    <li> Terrible! The rollers get very hot and only one end has the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; tip. Of course you need one hand to roll and hold everything in place while the other manipulates the clip, so one hand gets burned. And the rollers don&#x27;t hold the hair well at all. I don&#x27;t recommend it and I&#x27;m sorry I bought it. Spend the money and get Baby Bliss! Or Conair.</li>
    <li> Hi I re river my order today from amazon, right on time as they said.  The rollers are beautiful I haven&#x27;t tried tried them yet, but Many years ago I had a set they were steam rollers, these you just plug in no worries about putting in water, I find these are great for the price  I just may buy another set as my hair is, long. Much easier to roll instead  of holding a curling iron. :-) Thank you Amazon.  Joanna</li>
    <li> I have used the curlers once since i got them yesterday and i wasn&#x27;t that impressed. They work pretty well but even after you use hair spray the curls only stay in for about 30 minutes. Then your hair falls flat. It isn&#x27;t even wavy. I liked my friends&#x27; curlers but they were velvet kind of and they worked better. They were conair. The Revlon curlers don&#x27;t hold your hair in because they are all plastic so your hair doesn&#x27;t stay. Over all i wasn&#x27;t that impressed. I would definatly return them if i could. And the first time they heated up they smelled AWFUL!  I wouldn&#x27;t recomend them to my friends.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Great curls for me.  I am new at using hot rollers, I have always used a curling iron.  I thought they were simple, fast, and produced a wonderful bounce.  I save myself at least 15 minutes in the morning.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this item.  It&#x27;s too hard to set hair;  the clips donot work for me.</li>
    <li> These are great curlers. I use them on my long hair to make loose ringlets. I start at the top by the roots and wrap the hair around the curler, instead of starting with the ends and rolling up. I am very pleased with the product. My only complaint is that the lid is not attached, so every time I pick it up, the lid falls off and the pins go every where. Oh well.</li>
    <li> First the picture indicates the lid and the gray bottom are connected \\&quot;hinged\\&quot; together. Nope - 2 separate pieces. It barely stays together - the slightest bump and the clear lid slides off - heat escapes - wasted energy.  Second, the giant 1970&#x27;s bobby-pin shaped clips are a joke - good luck getting them to hold the curler and your hair long enough to curl - plan on buying clam-shaped plastic clips and third, the curlers are not covered in any way to protect hair from direct heat. This set will not \\&quot;travel\\&quot;!! This wasted time-convenient purchase buys me time to shop for a GOOD curler set. Hello - Revlon - it is time to utilize current, energy efficient and healthy technology!!! It IS the 21st century, ya know?</li>
    <li> Does the job but actually the smaller rollers have too large clips and they don&#x27;t hold as well.</li>
    <li> The box was in good condition and the curlers looked quality. Bought these for my grandmother for Christmas. She will love them!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants big , sexy voluminous curls. These curls last all day . They don&#x27;t even need any product to hold in. It&#x27;s good for a night out . It&#x27;s fast easy and beautiful.!</li>
    <li> They get pretty hot which is what I was looking for. The clips aren&#x27;t the best but I have another kind that I use with them instead. Overall I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> wife loved it and uses it alot..and got me some chon chon..so all is well..great product and arrived fast.and  my ifes hair looks awesome</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife to replace older Sunbeam set she had. This unit looks exactly like the Sunbeam, only the inside center of the rollers is different. It sets on a smaller pin instead of a larger pole to heat. She liked the Sunbeam alot but can&#x27;t find it. This is practically the identical unit so transition was easy for her.</li>
    <li> My stylist kept telling me to buy a set of rollers and I kept putting her off.  Finally I found these and decided to get them.  They heat up quickly and they work very well.  The curl is pretty but doesn&#x27;t hold long (but most heated curls don&#x27;t).  It usually drops to a wave.  It does manage to give my hair some body.</li>
    <li> Having shorter hair the only curlers I use are the smaller and medium sized rollers.  I could really use more smaller rollers and it would be nice if extra pins were included.&lt;br /&gt;It does curl your hair fast but not very long lasting.</li>
    <li> Originally thought it was a fast heating set of rollers like others I&#x27;ve had; it wasn&#x27;t but works fine if you don&#x27;t mind waiting a while for the rollers to heat up.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason why the pins won&#x27;t hold the rollers in place: The pins are WIDER than the rollers. I like everything else about these, but if I have to stand there and hold each one individually in place with my fingers, how is that better than a curling iron? Everything else is great: they heat quickly, have a shape that holds the hair, etc. As somebody else noted, the lid is pretty useless, but I can live w/ that. If you buy these, take into account that you&#x27;ll have to buy pins that actually work (as a separate purchase). I&#x27;m thinking of trying to \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; the pins w/a pair of pliers and see if that will make them work. And you have to ask yourself . . . should I really have to \\&quot;remanufacture\\&quot; any part of a purchase? Shouldn&#x27;t the maker do better than this????</li>
    <li> I imagined this product to be a lot bigger. It works alright. It takes about 15+ minutes for the rollers to get hot enough to do anything to my fine hair. The rollers aren&#x27;t really big and there is not way of telling when they are hot enough. The top case really has no purpose and doesn&#x27;t even stay on. These are only good if you want a slight wave in your hair. I honestly think a curling iron works much better. For what I paid, I am not impressed.</li>
    <li> These rollers heat up very fast and if more than 5 mins lapse they are very hot to handle and burn your head a little.  Otherwise they work.</li>
    <li> IT GETS THE JOB DONE, BUT THINK IT MAY NOT LAST VERY LONG. VERY CHEAPLY MADE, LID COMES OFF TOTALY OR ITS ON, DOES NOT JUST OPEN. I EXPECTED IT TO BEALOT BETTER QUALITY.</li>
    <li> My favorite.  Couldn&#x27;t find anywhere but Amazon and they work great.  Thinking of getting a second one so that in a few years when I need to replace this one - I&#x27;ll have it.</li>
    <li> NOT ENOUGH SMALL CURLERS.  DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> I did not like it as much as my travel size revlon but after a few months it really did fit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week I accidentally left it on for two days yet it did not burn down my house and still works.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, gets very hot, watch your fingers, gives a nice curl.  Good selection of sizes.</li>
    <li> I had a great set of curlers (the much like this, but the velvety kind) that was starting to get worn, so I tossed them. I wish I would have NEVER done that. I then went through 3 different new sets of curlers over the course of a year and threw them all away. I have very long, very thick hair. I did a lot of research online and found these,. When they came in the mail I was hesitant. The lid is pretty dumb...its not connected. I am not sure why it is really there other than to keep the curlers hot and get them hot faster. I was also a little nervous when I saw that they were not the velvety kind that I was used to. I couldn&#x27;t tell from the photos. I am happy to report that they do work though, just as well as my original set did! FINALLY! They do get VERY hot, so you have to be careful of your fingertips. I had several sets years ago that had the metal pins, so they are easy for me to use. You just have to practice and have patience. Now they take me no time at all. I actually prefer them over those cheap plastic clasps most curlers come with now. Worth every penny...I think they are a steal!</li>
    <li> Good for coarse wavy hair.  Buy some extra clips though, I got ones with clasp as the simple ones included don&#x27;t hold shorter hair as well</li>
    <li> These curlers produce very loose curls, even when I use the smallest rollers, and the curls fall quickly regardless of the type and amount of product in my hair. I get excellent results with my revlon curling iron, so I&#x27;m not sure why these don&#x27;t work for me. Additionally, I have short but thick hair and just one set of these is not enough, I have to curl one side of my head then heat them up again and do the other side. If you have thick hair, I recommend getting two sets...although I don&#x27;t really recommend getting any at all.</li>
    <li> I had a similar hairsetter made by Clairol many years ago that I loved, but I cut my hair short and no longer needed it so gave it away.  Now my hair is longer again, so I needed a new one, and this is very close to what I had before.  I like it very much.  One comment about your description.  I don&#x27;t think the case is actually purple as described--I think it is a dusty gray, and is quite nice..</li>
    <li> This is plastic junk that overheats, burns your head, hair, can&#x27;t compare to its predecessors.  The plastic top falls off.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  It&#x27;s garbage and a waste of money. Get the velcro rollers and use them on dry hair for an hour instead.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Clairol curler for 30 years and regret throwing it away for this.  I threw this away after two months.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They replaced a very old Clairol set and they are just as good.  They heat up fast and retain their heat.  I also like the fact that the rollers have pins for each size - some don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I returned this hair setter because the ends of the rollers get too hot to handle. The rollers are also very small.</li>
    <li> The Revlon RV261 roller took forever to heat-up.  I did not like that the lid was not attached to the main body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the roller sizes and heat. I have had a simailar model when Revlon first came out with them. This model is more finger friendly and the curls are great. If you fingers are very very sensitve you shouldn&#x27;t use them. The rollers do have an area where you can hold the roller to roll it on and pin it. The rollers from the past did not have this finer protection so for me this works great!</li>
    <li> These work great, heat up fast (fastest 5 min - really hot - 15 min) and are easy to hold, clips are great, and is overall a great selection of sizes and number of rollers.</li>
    <li> I grew up with a roller steam hairsetter, this is an updated verson.  It gets very hot, so it was causing hair breakage, thus discontinued using it for now.</li>
    <li> The clips in this hairsetter hold the rollers firmly in place. The ridges on the rollers effectively align the hair strands as they&#x27;re wrapped into the slightly concave surface. I had another set of rollers with a flocked, velvety surface - those rollers would just slide out of my hair. I also had a travel set with rubberized rollers - those would grab my hair and were uncomfortable to use. The Revlon RV261 is very quick and comfortable to use. It includes a versatile set of roller sizes for my shoulder length hair. I rarely use the largest size unless I want to smooth out an area that is too curly. For a soft look I only leave the rollers in for about a minute. Using this hairsetter is much faster for me than using a curling iron. As others have said, the cover is very frustrating because it slips off so easily, however, since the hairsetter heats up quickly without the lid I only use it if I&#x27;m packing the hairsetter into my suitcase for a trip. Straddling the clips over the edge of a little cup or vase makes them easy to grab when styling my hair.</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the holders for the rollers don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use it effectively and wish I had not bought it.</li>
    <li> I like the rollers very much,I only wish there was a set that eliminated the smallest rollers and replaced them with the largest ones.</li>
    <li> This product was very disappointing.  The directions were not clear and did not say how long it would take for the rollers to heat up.  The rollers, when I did pick them up, burned my fingers and burned my the ends of my hair.  I would not recommend this item to anyone and wish I could return this item.</li>
    <li> It is very hot and not enough protection for fingers.  I was hoping to have longer ribs.  There should be a handle on the lid.  I am glad there is not an automatic shutoff.  I put tape on my thumbs to keep from the heat. It is better than the one I purchased at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Revlon RV261 20 roller in approx.6 years. I was so happy to find it here so I could have another roller set for my hair. My other set had just broke after about 6 years. I use it every day and I love them. They curl quickly and I take them out , my hair stays curly until my next wash. It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair if you take them out when you have put in your last curler. Don&#x27;t leave them in your hair for a long time. My hair is beautiful and bouncy and I get my hair cut every 8 weeks. I am always getting compliments on my hair. I am 57 yrs young with medium length, colored, straight hair, but fantastic curls after using these rollers:-) Thank you Revlon :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased this product and love it. It&#x27;s easy to wrap the hair around. The pins are the old-fashioned kind and are perfect. My hair is thin and fine so the curlers may get too hot for my scalp. But, as with my previous set, I just turn them off and then start curling. The residual heat lasts long enough to set the entire head. The secret to long lasting curls is to leave them in the hair until your head is completely cool. When you take the curlers out you will have shiny, bouncy locks. Really!!</li>
    <li> These curlers have almost no nubs to hold fine or short hair.  I still have full-width plastic curler covers from my old hot rollers, and they can serve, but one must dampen all hair.  The wire &amp;#34;clips&amp;#34; are worthless for holding fine,short, fly-away hair.</li>
    <li> They do not work like I thought they would.</li>
    <li> Nice set but wish lid was attached, being separate is awkward during use and storage (it often falls off spilling contents)</li>
    <li> This product was very nice, however, it doesn&#x27;t work well with shorter hair.  The rollers don&#x27;t stay in.  I purchased this for my mother who has a bit shorter hair.  She is keeping it, but try as she might she is unable to get the rollers to stay in her hair in order to use the hairsettter.</li>
    <li> I have asian hair. first time I used it, I left it in my hair for 30 mins (because I was running around) and the curls (more so waves) lasted the whole day!&lt;br /&gt;I did not add any products to my hair, no hair spray, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say waves because I didn&#x27;t place the rollers for curls so they came out as waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair was soft, shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good product for the price. efficient at curling my kind of hair. (which is, and always will be naturally straight no matter what I do to it).</li>
    <li> I loved it until it stopped heating rollers 4 months after I purchased it. I only use rollers once per week so that translates into less than 16 operations.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and makes nice curls, I wish there was more of the big ones but that&#x27;s the case with all hot rollers.</li>
    <li> This fit all my needs. When I need to place some curls, I use these. They don&#x27;t get so hot that they hurt.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t even work when it arrived.cost £28.58 to buy and £18.25 to return it to the states will see if you refund all of that to me.i am sure you wont</li>
    <li> After using a small curler for an extended period of time I was  more than excited to try something else. These curlers work great! I have been able to style my hair however I please and create some new looks with the wide variety of curlers. I use theme almost everyday and do not want to go back. -They heat up fast  -Have various selection of curlers  -Cool to touch sides  -And just plain look beautiful!</li>
    <li> My sister loved it .  we had tried another that didn&#x27;t curl at all, but I want this one, too</li>
    <li> Revlon&#x27;s ionic hair curling set is the best!  Within minutes the curlers were hot and ready to use!  The curling sets downfall - lid design and small space for clips. The lid is not attached and can easily slide off.  As for the clips, I had to create my own device for holding them.</li>
    <li> I love these and was worried the price would mean cheap and not very hot. Nope they get real hot, they are good curlers.</li>
    <li> Great price and really curls my hair well.  So glad I got it for myself.  Really liked the on/off switch for energy and safety issues.</li>
    <li> The first set of these Revlon curlers worked great. I only had to keep the curlers in my hair for 5 minutes for perfect curls. They Got super hot and my curls lasted all day long then they just stopped heating up. So I purchased a new set on Amazon. These hardly get hot and even keeping them in my hair for 15 minutes I am lucky to have my curls last a few hours. Not good.</li>
    <li> not enough small rollers for use for thin hair. Should be able to order more small rollers tried but couldn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this dumb product zero stars.  The stupid clips that come with it don&#x27;t even hold the roller in your hair.  I hate this product so much I just threw it in the garbage.  It is SO STUPID!  I&#x27;m really frustrated and trying not to cuss.  It was a huge waste of money.  The rollers don&#x27;t grip your hair.  You can only do curls under, or curls &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; for a flippy look.  Better off with a curling iron, unless you want a hairdo straight out of the 1950s or 60s.  I have never been so unhappy and disappointed with a product.  Real on needs to stick to makeup and tweezers.</li>
    <li> this is a great hairsetter heats like the older style models quick and hot will set a curl love it great price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I really like these rollers because they don&#x27;t take a long time to warm up so it make it very easy to roll up my hair and get on my way. I will say that I have shoulder length hair so if you have longer hair it might take longer than it will for me. Like other people posted, the rollers can be a bit hot to the touch when you first take them out of the warmer but just set it down for a minute and it&#x27;s fine after that. I would&#x27;ve loved to give this product a 5 star review, but I didn&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t like the clips that came with them. I purchased pin curl clips and they work really well at holding the rollers in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping. I have used these 1 time so far, and they do a great job! It is hard to find the rollers with the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on them-this set has them and I really like the way they curl my hair!</li>
    <li> One row/one third of the unit stopped heating and smells like it is burning.  Unfortunately, discovering it had only a 30 day warranty,.With shorter hair, these rollers do not stay in place as well as flocked rollers.</li>
    <li> The rollers take over 20 minutes to heat up, and the clips don&#x27;t hold the roller very well.  I even tightened the clips with a pair of pliers, but that didn&#x27;t help.  I am sorry I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> These are pretty great, they get hot enoug but not too hot to handle.  I&#x27;m just not very good at putting them in!  I&#x27;ve had someone else put them in for me twice now and each time I&#x27;ve liked how my hair came out.</li>
    <li> I have been using hot rollers for years and needed a new set.  I read the reviews on these and figured they would work well.  I was disappointed when I realized the roller sizes were much smaller than any other set I have had.  The large rollers are the size of most medium and the medium are pretty close to small in other sets.  They work great and give tons of curl and body, but I didn&#x27;t want such small curls.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s practically like my old one, but it gets too hot if one is not careful, and the rollers are then hard to handle.  If one turns it off, it cools down too quickly.  The rollers also don&#x27;t quite grip the hair as well as my old one did (especially if they are burning your fingers!).  Perhaps the fabric rollers would be better.  But it&#x27;s very inexpensive and otherwise quite satisfactory for the money.  Takes a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> Not everyone has long hair -- nice if the MFG would make a set with all small rollers. Heats up well. Learning curve with the use of the pins. Learned to hook two together to hold them in.</li>
    <li> I purchase this because this type of clip stays in my hair a lot better.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the lid, it would be better if it was attached.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully when my hair was longer, but I went to a much shorter hair style.</li>
    <li> Great price, and do these ever get really hot!  The curl lasts forever -- love these.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product--rollers heat quickly, seat easily after use. Compact, but take up quite a bit of suitcase space in travel. Much better than other brands I have used in past years.</li>
    <li> Love my new rollers!  I now get bouncy curls that actually last all day!  Very cool.  Hate the hot rollers with the felt - they slide off, don&#x27;t curl properly - just not a big fan of those.  I will recommend the Revlon Hot rollers to friends for sure........very easy to use.  The only think I would like to see is at least 4 more of the large rollers  Other than that - Perfect.  Once again, Thank You Amazon for getting my products out to me asap!!</li>
    <li> The rollers heat quickly and are easy to use. The design uses all space compactly. Extra roller pins are included.</li>
    <li> picks won&#x27;t hold rollers. there is nothing else to say. Very Disappointed. Nothing Else to say. Picks won&#x27;t hold rollers</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and has a small footprint. Curlers weather the heat well. Lid is convenient and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Wife said it&#x27;s an excellent set, only problem she has with it is the case says she would rather have a flip top.</li>
    <li> I am always leary of styling products, because I have super fine, super curly hair.  However, these hot rollers are the bomb!  They curl my hair without damaging it.  I love them!  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I use this often and easily. It has a good range of sizes. Rollers stay in the hair. It is quick and it leaves my hands free to do makeup and then the rollers are cooled enough to take out when makeup is done.</li>
    <li> Although the rollers are good, the clips don&#x27;t stay in as well as other&lt;br /&gt;clips I&#x27;ve used, but does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I previously had these curlers which I had for a number of years.  I could not find them anywhere and someone told me to go on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these curlers for anyone who uses heated curlers.</li>
    <li> and time is important to me, and it does not curl the hair like it should, it is like does not curl at all.</li>
    <li> Let me first state that these rollers work very well. I have fine hair and as I&#x27;m aging, it&#x27;s only getting finer and more fragile.  My hair is slightly layered and goes just past shoulder length. These curled the hair wonderfully in a very short period of time.  Probably left them in for 10-15 min tops. The unit delivers on what it promises and I have no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have commented, they can be hot to handle and if you have very sensitive fingertips, beware.  It was not something that was unbearable for me though. I washed and dried my hair while the unit heated up and it was ready by the time I was done blow drying.  As others have stated, there WAS a distinct odor (common to such devices) as the rollers was heating up. Not pleasant but it seemed to dissipate after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are not enough larger rollers.  The smallest ones make VERY tight curls and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone wanting curls that tight unless they were trying to do all over spirals - and there&#x27;s not enough of that size roller in this unit to do those anyway.  If you intersperse the smallest roller with the largest ones throughout the hair, the effect is very odd - larger looser waves in some places, and tight, very tiny curls in others.  If this unit had all medium and larger rollers it would be 5-stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to mist rollers but can&#x27;t find them anywhere.  These get so hot that my fingers are burning when trying to put them in.  They give a good curl and smooth out the cuticle of the hair but get way too hot</li>
    <li> The teeth are not large enough to hold my fine hair so I have trouble keeping the rollers in my hair. I guess if your hair is thick it is OK.</li>
    <li> Great hairsetter and heats very fast.  Issue I have is the rollers heat all over and they are too hot to hold.  The clips that come with this are lame - the rollers will not stay in place.  You need the clip type that actually go over the roller.  No real directions are included.  No hairsetting tips or best way to use, etc.  I used once and now will give this away with these warnings.  Also lid will not stay on.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair the rollers absolutely will not hold without a clip type that covers the roller</li>
    <li> Poor design; cheaply made.  I didn&#x27;t even bother to return it since I&#x27;d thrown away the packaging.  NEVER will buy another Revlon product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural now and I gave them to my sister</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. curlers do not get hot enough.</li>
    <li> I have not had a set of hotrollers for many years so I decided to buy this for myself as a Christmas present. I was very pleased with item.</li>
    <li> Easy to use once you get use to the clips to hold the curlers in place.  Used on damp hair, especially with a hair styling product, curls last all day!</li>
    <li> The  medium clips and medium rollers don&#x27;t fit - the rollers fall out because the clip isn&#x27;t tight enough so the medium rollers are effectively not usable.</li>
    <li> Curls hair nicely. Easy to use. Heats up quickly. Hot but cool enough to handle. On/off switch. Wish docking station was a little smaller</li>
    <li> I love the Revlon RV261 hairsetter.  This is my third hairsetter.  There are 3 different size rollers.  I use Butterfly clips to hold my rollers in.  It heats up fast and the rollers are easy to use. It&#x27;s nice looking too.  I would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;KB</li>
    <li> Not expensive, great for travel which is why I got them.  Heat up fast.  My hair is super straight and these curl my hair and it stays with hairspray.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> We had this one for 15 years and as things go it finally failed.  Wife bought a different model at Target and it burned her fingers.  She is glad we found her old model on Amazon.  Working fine.  Get another 15 years?  That would be a buck and a half a year!  Wish my car lasted 15 years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than I hoped it would be. Totally love it!</li>
    <li> Like the rollers/clips better then the clip-ons.  Some times the rollers get too hot, but I guess that&#x27;s my fault.  Cleaner then the last one I had.</li>
    <li> The lid slids off at the sightest touch - so forget about trying to pick it up and move it anywhere  And how would you travel with them???  Put a rubberband around the whole thing?.  I have fine hair.  The rollers are so hot they burn my fingers and burn my scalp and the clips don&#x27;t hold the hair in place.  The clip holder is so shallow the clips slide out.  VERY disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the metal clips, but I had some other clips from another set of rollers that fit.  It does help my hair hold curl longer during the day.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how pleased and surprised I was with how quickly this item arrived!  I used it the same night and it created great curls that lasted even without hairspray which is rare for my fine hair.  The ends were very hot and burned my fingertips a little but you just have to be smart when holding any HOT rollers.</li>
    <li> I did not care for the rollers or the fact that the lid is not hinged.  Just not what I was looking for; they were returned.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to curl my daughters hair for a wedding in which she was a flower girl. They ended up working perfectly. They heat up quickly and over half the wedding party used them. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> She loves them.  Thank you.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Electric curlers are hard to come by these days. This is a good set with consistent heat and a variety of sizes to cover your whole head. I wish the manufacturer would  make the clips a bit longer. These barely hold the curlers tight if you have a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> These are not the easiest curlers to use, they are not very comfortable and when putting them in....be careful not to burn your fingers. The curl decently, but not the best.</li>
    <li> did not meet expectations-----not good for short hair---rollers will fall out---returning the item</li>
    <li> The curler I bought came in a timely manner and were excactly what I expected..thanks.</li>
    <li> It works and heats up fast, but the curls fall out after 10-20 minutes, but maybe I just need a better hair spray or something. As many reviewers have said, the lid isn&#x27;t attached to the box very well. I bought this, ignoring those comments, thinking the lid would click or snap into place and stay on, but it doesn&#x27;t. It makes storing and taking this out to use a pain because the lid comes off easily and everything will fall out. I find it annoying to have to gather the clips especially.</li>
    <li> Works just as the ads say</li>
    <li> This is a great hair setter, however, after I used it a few times, the internal heat components of two of the smallest rollers completely fell apart.  But by this time, it was too late to return it.  I don&#x27;t use the smallest ones, so it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  This set heats up very quickly (10 minutes) and gets really hot.  My hair is hard to curl and the rollers have to be very, very hot in order to create curls.  I&#x27;m pleased to say that I get great results with this set.  I really hate to mess with my hair and won&#x27;t spend more time than the few minutes it takes to roll it up.  I wash my hair at night and then let it dry overnight and apply my makeup while the rollers are cooling.  They stay hot enough for long enough to create pretty waves in my hair.  I also like the clips that come with the set.  Plastic clamps result in crimp marks so I&#x27;m glad this set has the old fashioned metal u-shaped clips, which never mark the hair.  The plastic top is a bit unwieldy and it makes no difference whether the top is on or off when the rollers are heating up.  The only reason I keep it is that sometimes I need to pack it into a suitcase and it helps the rollers stay in place.  The little tray for storing the clips is not large enough to accommodate all the clips.  This is not a problem since I simply leave them all on the bathroom counter.  This set was reasonably priced and works so well I would have paid more for it.  The rollers grip the hair easily too.  All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase despite the problem with the small rollers.  The chances of that happening to someone else is small.  Still, it&#x27;s a good set and a good buy.</li>
    <li> Loose lid is annoying and no place to keep metal clips. It all falls all over.</li>
    <li> Nice hot roller set.  Heats quickly and doesn&#x27;t tangle in your hair!</li>
    <li> I am holding onto this with the hope that longer hair will allow me to use them.  they are so slick that the roller just falls out .  I am still using a handheld curling brush for now.</li>
    <li> Curlers get hot very quickly and are fairly easy to put into hair. Curls quick and stays curled. Good product for the price</li>
    <li> The clear top or cover on this product constantly flips off if you pick it up to put it away.  The rollers also fall from my hands constantly.  I feel I have butterfingers handeling this but my daughter has the same problem as me.  My husband asked what&#x27;s wrong with us, then he picked it up and the whole thing ended up on the floor.  I wish I purchased a different set.</li>
    <li> No complaints! Does the trick in very little time. Doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and holds curl all day!</li>
    <li> These curlers are nice, but I have trouble keeping them in with my fine hair. I bought them to replace my old set that had velvet on them, and I think the velvet helped with my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I spent weeks looking for some hot rollers that didn&#x27;t cost over 35.00.  I found these, and thought I would give them a try.  I wanted to use them a bit before I reviewed them.&lt;br /&gt;These hot rollers work well enough, but the reason they are only getting 3 stars is because I find them difficult to roll and grip the hair.  They do not have velvet on them like my old ones, they have little stubs that don&#x27;t really grab onto the hair.  I think that if someone where elderly and or has arthritis, they may find them difficult if not impossible to use properly. It doesn&#x27;t specify in the description but there are 3 sizes.  6 small, 8 medium, and 6 large.I will probably keep them because I was tired of looking for what I want.  I found what I wanted on a auction site, but they wanted 30.00 and up for a used set.</li>
    <li> 5 stars.  Bought one years ago  it has worked great. My daughter wanted one. I had hoped I could find one again  New product is as good as the one I purchased years ago.  Thank you for still producing a great product.</li>
    <li> I was a hair dresser for over 25 years. These rollers are just like the ones I used back then. Why I gave them away I have no idea. Saves me time and I get a different look.</li>
    <li> Heat up fully as I have been told.  Great product for the money last a little longer than others do</li>
    <li> She had been searching for curlers with pins instead of clips. Apparently the clips will not hold the curls in her very long hair.</li>
    <li> I got&lt;br /&gt;This and does&lt;br /&gt;Me work I want a new one that works or&lt;br /&gt;My&lt;br /&gt;Money back</li>
    <li> My wife as yet has had no complaints about it, I guarantee if anything was not perfect she would complain.</li>
    <li> These are great. I lack the motivation and arm strength to curl my hair with an iron so these are excellent. Five minutes to put them all in, do my make up and pull them out. I usually let the curls chill for a few minutes before I tousle and spray them.</li>
    <li> Rollers way to heavy and constantly fall out of your hair</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  I had never used hot rollers before and wanted to try them to add some volume to my long hair.  They work great and create a nice curl.  However, the curl doesn&#x27;t hold too long, but I suspect I just haven&#x27;t found a good hairspray to use.  It turns into a wave after a half hour or so and then completely falls back to being straight within an hour.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair don&#x27;t buy this. The rollers don&#x27;t hold enough hair so you would need 2 sets and when you unroll your hair it tangles easily. The curls don&#x27;t last at all!!  Wish I would have saved the box, they would have been returned.</li>
    <li> I have super frizzy hair.  This set does the trick of making my hair very nice.</li>
    <li> its really hard to try and put the curls on after they have heated up because i seem to burn myself every time i try to get it right the product is a good product but should of made it easier to put them on l</li>
    <li> After years of very short hair.  I let my very fine hair grow out.  The rollers heat up very fast and do not need to be kept on for long.  By the time I finish rolling the back, it&#x27;s time to start taking them out.  Extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The lid is not attached, so when you carry it anywhere, if you don&#x27;t have a good grip all over it, the lid slips off and scatters the clips all over the floor.  The ends are NOT cool - I have burned my fingers every time I used them.  The clips are not tight, and adjusting them makes your fingers burn more.  I&#x27;m online now trying to find another, different set. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The clips  don&#x27;t fit around the curlers I need some different ones! Please send me some new ones. I need 3 different sizes</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  A little pricey though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to keep them, and will use them, though not everyday.  I&#x27;ve gone through multiple sets of rollers, and am just tired of trying. Certainly not worth mailing them back to Amazon. Definitely take the lid off when you turn them on, you need some of the heat to escape to the atmosphere. When you use them, be careful because they will burn your fingers. Your hair will be very curly, for about 30 minutes, then it will be straight and dead-looking as it tries to recover from being cooked. The old set of Clairol rollers that I was replacing didnt&#x27; get quite as hot, and my hair stayed curly longer. New isn&#x27;t necessarily better.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time and was as described.</li>
    <li> I hve used this Revlon roller for years.  It&#x27;s the best hot roller I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> You cannot find these electric curlers in stores any more.  It was exactly what I wanted and was delivered very promptly.  So glad I thought to look for it through you.</li>
    <li> The Revlon RV261 hair setter gave me the most amazing results! As my hair grew longer blow drying my hair made my hair limp. In a matter of seconds the Revlon hair setter gives my hair body that lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> This product worked well, but only for 3 months, and now the rollers no longer heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Contacted Revlon about this unit 10 days ago. They told me that it is actually made by \\&quot;Helen of Troy\\&quot; and forwarded my claim to them. So far no word on a replacement or warranty return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: One month later, and still have not heard back from Helen of Troy regarding replacement!!!</li>
    <li> Delivered very quickly!  This set of rollers really works fast..no need to leave them in a long time to curl your hair.  They heat up quickly too!</li>
    <li> The lid falls off the unit, and the pins that are included don&#x27;t hold the rollers in place. I&#x27;m glad I kept the clips from my old set, as they work okay...kinda.</li>
    <li> Love them! For me it is the easiest way to have a head full of sexy curls!</li>
    <li> Gets really hot like I need it to. Great product for great price!</li>
    <li> Read previous reviews but purchased anyway. Product cheaply made and performs only so-so. Absolutely would NOT recommend to anyone. Have had it for 2 months so too late to send back. Will replace as soon as icon find a good replacement.</li>
    <li> This heats up fast and curls the hair really good. It also works really well to voluminous my long hair.</li>
    <li> A little harsh on the scalp</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. Smells hot. The pins are difficult to use. Lid falls off. Overall though, pretty good for the price paid.</li>
    <li> Love the fact they heat fast and doesn&#x27;t use clips! The clips always leaves a crinkle in my hair!! My hair is never frizzy with these either!</li>
    <li> Judging by the reviews, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a hot roller set that is perfect, but I took a chance on this one.  I rarely go to the trouble to return things I don&#x27;t like due to laziness, but this had to go.  It does *not* get hot enough at all.  I gave it plenty of time to heat up, put in the rollers, and let them cool completely before removing them.  It gave me pretty curls at first, but my hair was flat within an hour.  Thinking that maybe it needed even more time to heat up, I tried again, this time letting the rollers heat up for a half hour.  It didn&#x27;t make a difference- they fell out even faster and I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that the rollers weren&#x27;t getting nearly as hot as they needed to.  One more try and tons of hairspray later, I decided to send it back.  There are plenty of other options, so the search continues.</li>
    <li> i like the varity of sizes and that they heat up quickly.  The curl holds all day and your hair will shine. Downside, they can very hot and are difficult to hold.</li>
    <li> I had the older model for any years until it no longer worked. I was so pleased when I found what appeared to be its replacement. Although the curler sizes were the same which I loved as well as the compact size, just right for a small sink vanity, I was VERY disappointed in the fact that this model now does not have the velvet surrounding the curler but rather solid plastic with some slight ribbing. I have not gotten used to the fact my hair does not roll up as nice and slides out easily. As far as the shipping it was very fast and the product was packaged very well. Everything was excellent except I wish Revlon would of stayed with the velvet on the curlers!</li>
    <li> I like the 3 sizes of the rollers and the pins they come with hold the rollers in really well.  Only complaint is that when transporting it the lid has come off and all the pins and rollers fall to the floor bc the lid doesn&#x27;t snap in or anything, it just lays on top.  And the cradle for the pins is crowded and small</li>
    <li> they heated up fast and the case is very nice, I had one before but my child took it when she left home</li>
