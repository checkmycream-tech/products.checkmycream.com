      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>It keeps you nice &amp; curly but gives your hair coordination, somehow.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice, too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using wash-out conditioner since this works so well on its own after a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I have two honey babies of  my own.  </li>
      <li>It did the job, for me...for my kind of hair.</li>
      <li>This product also feels nice in the palms of my hands after application.</li>
      <li>Its nice</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it provides a nice sleek shine to my hair and helps with fly-aways.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, it give me the perfect degree of hold for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I love love love this product!  </li>
      <li>WISH this would be available at a better cost now adays!</li>
      <li>The more humidity, the better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more of this product.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Also, the fragrance is fantastic!</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and smooth after using this product and smells great!  </li>
      <li>This is one of many of my hair care products.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of the product along with the consistancy when applied to my hair:</li>
      <li>but i was expecting more.</li>
      <li>Consequently, I had to stop using most of my cosmetics and hair care products.  </li>
      <li>It makes for a lovely, shiny, no fuzz touchable head of hair.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Love the product</li>
      <li>First things first, I recieved the package about 4 days after setting the order, thus I was very happy with the shipping.</li>
      <li>Between the gel and the crème, if I had to use just one of these products it would be the gel because it has much more hold.</li>
      <li>This is pretty darn good.</li>
      <li>This is the best of many, many, MANY creme I&#x27;ve tried over the past two years.</li>
      <li>This Ever Style and Ever Sleek are both great as far as I am concerned.</li>
      <li>Con: Strong floral scent of honeysuckle or gardenia - if you don&#x27;t like that scent, it might be too stinky.</li>
      <li>I eventually washed my hair after visiting the gym :P, so I don&#x27;t know how many days it can last.</li>
      <li>so these two mentioned products work just fine for me.</li>
      <li>It works fine and leaves no greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>Pro Smooth Gloss Anti-Frizz Cream</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStyle Alcohol-Free Smooth &amp; Shine Creme&lt;br /&gt;Defuse&lt;</li>
      <li>Silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is what the product is marketed for, but it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Heat Protection and Shine Spray)&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
      <li>The first day I apply this, my hair looks more like it does with a mousse product, which is a bit crunchy.</li>
      <li>I color my hair with L&#x27;OREAL Glistening Magnolia but the kit contains the best small tube of continuous shine creme that you can NOT find anywhere else</li>
      <li>That being said, in winter this product is not as great because my house is really dry in winter and the results are not as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, it&#x27;s reasonably priced, smells great, and makes my hair so soft and shiny!  </li>
      <li>I can use a dime-sized squirt of this stuff in my fine, thin, collar-bone length hair and it dries flawlessly.  </li>
      <li>For me it achieves a soft, light, shiny look with a bit of volume at the top of my hair.</li>
      <li>Most days I don&#x27;t need to blow-dry my hair to have a frizz-free style, and it works amazingly well for an ultra silky-soft wet setting lotion for braid-outs or curls.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of hydrating dry hair &amp; preventing flyaways.</li>
      <li>About 6 years to be exact!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It took me a couple tries to get a good routine with this product, so I will share my method.</li>
      <li>Third day, went to the gym, no frizz and still nice curls.</li>
      <li>This is a rare product that I will go out of my way to write a review for.</li>
      <li>I get it pretty good and wet.</li>
      <li>Because it does not contain alcohol, it is very gentle.  </li>
      <li>When you use this product after washing and conditioning your hair, it&#x27;s okay, but I used it after the Eversleek smoothing system humidity defying leave-in-creme, and than it does not do anything extra for my hair.</li>
      <li>after searching for so many places at actual stores I was able to finally find it on amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m constantly running my fingers through my hair all day now, because I love the way it feels.</li>
      <li>First, the smell.</li>
      <li>I purchased two, and I won&#x27;t hesistate to purchase more in the future!</li>
      <li>I apply it after rubbing my hands together with it and starting at the top of my hair pressing downward &amp; smoothing it out to the end of my hair &amp; under.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am satisfied and hope to buy again after I finish the first one.</li>
      <li>My hair is a monster, so if this stuff can tame my curls, I guarantee you can get good results if you are patient enough to find a regimen that works for you!! :)</li>
      <li>I have very very fine hair that goes fuzzy in damp weather and is hard to style because it breaks easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it makes my hair look as good as the other product did as far as taming the fly-aways.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed long straight hair that is a bit dry with some fly aways.</li>
      <li>Why does L&#x27;Oreal continually make products with such strong scents?</li>
      <li>and the curls were nice, loose and soft.</li>
      <li>When I use this, it is the 4th thing I apply to my hair before blow drying it straight.</li>
      <li>This hair styling gel works very well for me.  </li>
      <li>I really do like this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have course, curly hair and this product not only smells great, but it allows me to tame my hair.</li>
      <li>it is it does not flake very easily and last me through the entire day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of it because my hair is already sprayed with an anti-frizz spray &amp; the tresemme keratin smooth flat iron spray &amp; the tresemme split remedy leave-in conditioning spray for my ends.</li>
      <li>I repeat the process on the other side of my head with more product.</li>
      <li>I love this gel because it is light... and does not make my hair greasy ... use only a little bit, and it does the trick</li>
      <li>Each dollop is a little bigger than the size of a cashew, so between the two it is a fair amount of product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even alcohol free, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff actually makes my hair curlier in high humidity!!!</li>
      <li>Day three I might have to apply a little more product to control the frizz at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was surprised how much I needed to use.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do the smooth or shine duties as much as I expected</li>
      <li>Much too far.</li>
      <li>and so I just make sure that I use a clarifying rinse a few times a month</li>
      <li>Makes my fine, frizz-prone hair much less so.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product makes your hair shine that&#x27;s for sure, but you have to have a lot of hair.. and for people who have thinning hair , I guess it&#x27;s not a good thing to use such products, as it may make your hair fall in the future.</li>
    <li> works and great scent, I get complimented on it all the time</li>
    <li> For me this is the best hair product I have ever found.  I use it every day and now my wife is too.</li>
    <li> 5/5 for the smell and.&lt;br /&gt;3/5 for the job it says it does - doesn&#x27;t stick around for the 48 hours as mentioned. Doesn&#x27;t do the smooth or shine duties as much as I expected&lt;br /&gt;from all the hype.</li>
    <li> Keeps the frizz away and hair is soft to the touch. The smell is not overwhelming . A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Keeps my curls fluffy with no frizz. Only con is that I have to put a lot of this product on my hair (and I have manageable hair) to eliminate the frizz and only keeps it for about 5 hours, despite the &amp;#34;48 hour&amp;#34; label. But during those 5 hours, my curls looks AMAZING… Volume and LUSH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair routine:&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo/condition my hair&lt;br /&gt;Apply heat protectant (Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Heat Protection and Shine Spray)&lt;br /&gt;Apply L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStyle Alcohol-Free Smooth &amp; Shine Creme&lt;br /&gt;Defuse&lt;br /&gt;Add small amounts of Pantene Pro-V 24 Hour Volume Hairspray&lt;br /&gt;Continue Defusing until hair is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This takes no more than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, it&#x27;s reasonably priced, smells great, and makes my hair so soft and shiny!  I love love love this product!  My hair is so soft and smooth after using this product and smells great!  I wash my hair every two to three days and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or oily at all.  I was afraid this product would be sticky and make my hair stiff but it doesn&#x27;t at all, this is the best \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; brand of hair crème I have ever tried! Wish I could give it six stars!</li>
    <li> It is not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I have wavy frizzy super long and thick hair and was looking for something to tame the lion&#x27;s mane that was not greassy or silicone based. I found this product at the store and took it home to try it. I washed my hair (I use a cleansing conditioner) and put on three times as much as it says on the label (my hair reaches all the way down to my waist) distributed it all over and then held my hair to the side and turn it to make a curl. I left it like this until it was dry. When the hair dried out there was no frizz and the curls were nice, loose and soft. Next day same thing, no frizz. Third day, went to the gym, no frizz and still nice curls. It did the job, for me...for my kind of hair. The perfume they put on it was driving me a little crazy the first day, but then it went away by the third day. I eventually washed my hair after visiting the gym :P, so I don&#x27;t know how many days it can last. It was not sticky or heavy, I could not feel anything on my hair. I really love it!</li>
    <li> When you use this product after washing and conditioning your hair, it&#x27;s okay, but I used it after the Eversleek smoothing system humidity defying leave-in-creme, and than it does not do anything extra for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only styling creme that can tame my frizzy hair. I only need a dime size amount on my wet hair. After I dry it it stays in place even during hot days.</li>
    <li> This product is labeled \\&quot;48 hour frizz control.\\&quot; I see no evidence whatsoever that is does anything. I think L\\&quot;Oreal is pushing the marketing envelope. Much too far. I find this product to be worthless.</li>
    <li> This hair styling gel works very well for me.  Just enough body, yet not to heavy.</li>
    <li> I have wavy to curly hair, depending on how it&#x27;s cut. This is the best of many, many, MANY creme I&#x27;ve tried over the past two years. It&#x27;s even alcohol free, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have very very fine hair that goes fuzzy in damp weather and is hard to style because it breaks easily.  This product has solved this problem!  By the way, you folks who have honey babies....children of mixed race who have fluffy fuzzy curls that you can&#x27;t seem to bring under control...try Loreal products.  You will be very pleased.  Loreal makes a super moisturizing shampoo and condiitoner, and Loreal Eversleek for daily conditioning and Loreal Everstyle for daily styling.  I know it works. I have two honey babies of  my own.  It works fine and leaves no greasy residue.  It makes for a lovely, shiny, no fuzz touchable head of hair.</li>
    <li> Love it! I needed something to put on my wet hair to help brush through the tangles &amp; leave my hair soft. This works well. I can even put on my dry hair in spots where it is frizzy &amp; it lays downs &amp; adds shine.</li>
    <li> Difficult to find this product in stores. I love the smell and it provides a nice sleek shine to my hair and helps with fly-aways.</li>
    <li> This is one of many of my hair care products. When I use this, it is the 4th thing I apply to my hair before blow drying it straight. I have wavy hair sometimes with random small curls (it&#x27;s not uniform &amp; strange). I apply it after rubbing my hands together with it and starting at the top of my hair pressing downward &amp; smoothing it out to the end of my hair &amp; under. I don&#x27;t use a lot of it because my hair is already sprayed with an anti-frizz spray &amp; the tresemme keratin smooth flat iron spray &amp; the tresemme split remedy leave-in conditioning spray for my ends. Overall the smooth&amp;shine creme doesn&#x27;t seem to add extra hair blow drying time &amp; is straight enough looking not requiring a flat iron to straighten it more once it&#x27;s dry. For me it achieves a soft, light, shiny look with a bit of volume at the top of my hair. Sometimes other products feel like they weigh my hair down, but not with this one. I finish off my look with kenra&#x27;s silkening gloss polish&amp;shine applying a bit to the mid to ends of my hair, avoiding the top of my hair after rubbing a small dose with my hands.</li>
    <li> Its a good product but i was expecting more.</li>
    <li> I love this gel because it is light... and does not make my hair greasy ... use only a little bit, and it does the trick</li>
    <li> I love the scent of the product along with the consistancy when applied to my hair: Silky smooth.  I purchased two, and I won&#x27;t hesistate to purchase more in the future!</li>
    <li> I like it.  Works well with my hair.  No oily or greasy feel.</li>
    <li> This Ever Style and Ever Sleek are both great as far as I am concerned. I color my hair with L&#x27;OREAL Glistening Magnolia but the kit contains the best small tube of continuous shine creme that you can NOT find anywhere else so these two mentioned products work just fine for me. I have waist length hair that I wear in a braid so these products keep the fly aways in control plus I like the fragrance of both. Not sure yet which one I will reorder to always have on hand. This product also feels nice in the palms of my hands after application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big hair product fan because I don&#x27;t like the way a lot of them make my hair feel. I like this one. It makes my hair soft and shiny and smooth. I notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it. Having said that, I do feel like it builds up and so I just make sure that I use a clarifying rinse a few times a month and that does the trick.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on advice from L&#x27;Oreal as the replacement for a product I like: L&#x27;Oreal Vive Pro glossy style. That has been discontinued to my dismay. Everstyle is no equivalent. First, the smell. Why does L&#x27;Oreal continually make products with such strong scents? Do they think people want to walk around all day smelling like their hair product instead of any perfume they may choose to wear? Pardon my bluntness, but this particular scent smells like a baby&#x27;s wet diaper at the beach. (Coconut, baby powder, and an unidentified underlying nasty odor.) I still smell it 10 hours later. I use some of their facial products and think all in all, they are terrible in the scent department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed long straight hair that is a bit dry with some fly aways. This stuff left my hair silky feeling, but also with some static that feels weird and doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. I&#x27;m not convinced it makes my hair look as good as the other product did as far as taming the fly-aways. And the smell will make me move on and try other brands.</li>
    <li> Estos productos hecho en USA son diferentes y mucho mejores que los hechos en Centro y Sudamerica. Siempre vuelvo a comprar aqui. Recomendado 100%&lt;br /&gt;Estos productos son de los mejores e el mercado.&lt;br /&gt;Todo lo hecho en USA termina siendo mejor. Da un lindo brillo al cabello.</li>
    <li> This product is so great. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but upon using this creme a few times, I&#x27;m so happy with the results. It leaves my hair SO soft. I&#x27;m constantly running my fingers through my hair all day now, because I love the way it feels. It smells really nice, too!&lt;br /&gt;I feared that this would be like a gel, which I got from a lot of anti-frizz products. But this is essentially a leave-in conditioner and you really just run it through your hair and let it dry and it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for YEARS. About 6 years to be exact! When I wash my hair, I put about a dime amount and run it evenly through all of my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavier, dried out, or greasy at all! I can still go a day or two in-between hair washes! Sadly they stopped selling this in stores near me, so I will be continually ordering from Amazon as needed. I recommend this for anyone who has naturally dry, frizzy, thick hair!</li>
    <li> WISH this would be available at a better cost now adays!</li>
    <li> Keeps hair silky and shiny. Love the product</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well. My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy but it gets &amp;#34;big,&amp;#34; if you will, if I don&#x27;t use anything in it. This smooths it out and while I have to straighten just a few parts, it definitely beats straightening all of my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it.  This is what I use and I can&#x27;t find it in the local stores anymore.</li>
    <li> after searching for so many places at actual stores I was able to finally find it on amazon.com. This works fantastically with my hair and give that would affect to my hair. But I also like about it is it does not flake very easily and last me through the entire day. I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more of this product.</li>
    <li> About 6 months ago, out of the blue, I developed chronic eczema.  Consequently, I had to stop using most of my cosmetics and hair care products.  In my search for substitutes, I came across this styling creme.  Because it does not contain alcohol, it is very gentle.  Nevertheless, it give me the perfect degree of hold for my naturally curly hair.  Also, the fragrance is fantastic!</li>
    <li> This crème is amazing. I use this in combination with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Alcohol-Free Stronghold Gel. I mix it 50/50 and it does wonders for my curls, which are long and looser in shape. This stuff actually makes my hair curlier in high humidity!!! And no, I don&#x27;t mean that it makes it frizzy, I mean I actually get some serious ringlets!!!! It&#x27;s amazing. The more humidity, the better. That being said, in winter this product is not as great because my house is really dry in winter and the results are not as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a couple tries to get a good routine with this product, so I will share my method. While my hair is wet (not excessively towel dried, but not dripping either) I apply a generous amount of both this crème and the gel I mentioned to my hand. Each dollop is a little bigger than the size of a cashew, so between the two it is a fair amount of product. Then I rub my hands together to mix the two products, and I apply the entire amount to ONE HALF of my hair, distributing it evenly. I repeat the process on the other side of my head with more product. I might use a little extra on the back of my head if I feel like it didn&#x27;t get enough. Then I let it air dry and DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT. Not even a little bit until it is completely dried, which can sometimes take up to 4 hours (I&#x27;ve only ever blow-dried my hair once, and it turned out okay so that is probably an option. But it&#x27;s not healthy for your hair so I try to avoid that). Because my hair is naturally very dry, I only wash it every two or three days. The first day I apply this, my hair looks more like it does with a mousse product, which is a bit crunchy. After it is completely dried, however, I scrunch it a little near the top and loosen the &amp;#34;gel cast&amp;#34; to soften the look a little. Then the next day or two I will re-wet my hair using a spray bottle. I get it pretty good and wet. Then I let it dry again, and this time it doesn&#x27;t take quite so long. Day two looks PERFECT. Day three I might have to apply a little more product to control the frizz at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it!! Between the gel and the crème, if I had to use just one of these products it would be the gel because it has much more hold. Adding this crème seems to soften the gel-cast, which is why I add it. If you find that your hair is frizzy when you first try this crème, use double the next time and see if it works. If that doesn&#x27;t work, then double it again. I was surprised how much I needed to use. My hair is a monster, so if this stuff can tame my curls, I guarantee you can get good results if you are patient enough to find a regimen that works for you!! :)</li>
    <li> First things first, I recieved the package about 4 days after setting the order, thus I was very happy with the shipping. I got the product and it was bigger than expected. Third, I tried it and it was like in an instant your hair just looks extremly silky, now that&#x27;s hard for me, being that my hair is very unruly and and tends to stand up like a scarecrow, but upon putting the creme it kept its place, no it did not become stiff and unbearably hard. Overall, I am satisfied and hope to buy again after I finish the first one.</li>
    <li> Makes my fine, frizz-prone hair much less so.  Please don&#x27;t take this as a sign to discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This is a rare product that I will go out of my way to write a review for. I apply this product while my hair is still damp before I blow dry. I have found that it has added fullness and volume to my very long, thick, heavy hair which is nearly impossible to do. I don&#x27;t think this is what the product is marketed for, but it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Works decently enough. I really do like this stuff. The first time I used it on dry hair it made my hair soft and silky. I could literally run my fingers through my hair. Then I tried it on my wet hair and it made it soft but not as soft as when I put in dry hair. I would buy this again since it straightened out my naturally curly hair and tamed the frizz. I would recommend this product to anyone but I would use it on dry hair first.</li>
    <li> Will purchase again.  I have course, curly hair and this product not only smells great, but it allows me to tame my hair.</li>
    <li> Con: Strong floral scent of honeysuckle or gardenia - if you don&#x27;t like that scent, it might be too stinky. I happen to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works in my fine limp hair without making it feel oily, streaky, or stuck down.  I&#x27;ve stopped using wash-out conditioner since this works so well on its own after a shampoo.  I can use a dime-sized squirt of this stuff in my fine, thin, collar-bone length hair and it dries flawlessly.  Most days I don&#x27;t need to blow-dry my hair to have a frizz-free style, and it works amazingly well for an ultra silky-soft wet setting lotion for braid-outs or curls.</li>
    <li> Why L&#x27;Oreal stopped making this is beyond me!  This is the best stuff I have found in years.  Unfortunately, I found it too late, and then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  It&#x27;s the only thing that leaves my dull, thin, frizzy hair shiny without stickiness.  If anyone else uses this and loves it, call the company like I did, and tell them to bring it back so that we don&#x27;t pay double the price!</li>
    <li> It is a little \\&quot;heavy cream\\&quot; but it works really good on my hair.  I use it every time a blow my hair.  Its nice</li>
    <li> This is pretty darn good. Not quite as good as the LOreal Vive Pro Smooth Gloss Anti-Frizz Cream my grocery store used to buy, but aaaallllllmmmmmoooooost as good. It does a good job of hydrating dry hair &amp; preventing flyaways. It keeps you nice &amp; curly but gives your hair coordination, somehow. definitely good for people with curly hair.</li>
    <li> One of the the conditioners was split on the seam. I lost some of the product, but saved the rest with taping it.</li>
