      <li>Love this shaving cream!!</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>It smells good and gets the job done without skin irritation.  </li>
      <li>Arrived on time and good price</li>
      <li>At 2 twin packs as advertised, it would have been a good price, at 1 it was not.</li>
      <li>I like the savings of a two-pack and is nice knowing</li>
      <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This is a better deal then you will find in most stores.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and softness..</li>
      <li>Nice smell, smooth shaving.</li>
      <li>I make sure my razors have some sort of soap on them it makes for an easier shave</li>
      <li>My spouse&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>The Twin Pack is a great value and makes it so that I don&#x27;t have to buy as often, which is nice :) Definitely recommend!</li>
      <li>Makes smooth legs, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>She says that is works well, smells nice, and it is great to be able to find it here on Amazon (hard to find in our local store).</li>
      <li>Skintimate is definitely my preferred brand of shaving cream, and Raspberry Rain is one of my favorite scents!</li>
      <li>Skintimate is a VERY rich lather, not drippy or too liquidy like some other brands, and it provides a nice close shave when used with the right razor.</li>
      <li>To keep your skin soft (and pesticide free) stop using shaving cream with vegetable oils in them.</li>
      <li>They work, Ive had better products in the past but for the price its decent.</li>
      <li>This is very misleading as it was actually just 1 twin pack.  </li>
      <li>I love that I can get a nice close shave without ever cutting myself!!</li>

    <li> this is an excellent product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream!! I love that I can get a nice close shave without ever cutting myself!! This is the only shaving cream my daughters and I use!</li>
    <li> Skintimate is definitely my preferred brand of shaving cream, and Raspberry Rain is one of my favorite scents! Skintimate is a VERY rich lather, not drippy or too liquidy like some other brands, and it provides a nice close shave when used with the right razor. Raspberry Rain smells great, too!

    <li> This is a better deal then you will find in most stores.</li>
    <li> The listing was for 2 packs of a twin pack.  This is very misleading as it was actually just 1 twin pack.  At 2 twin packs as advertised, it would have been a good price, at 1 it was not.</li>
    <li> Both cans clogged up and wouldn&#x27;t dispense after just a few uses. One can has about half left that I can&#x27;t use, the other has about 75% left that I can&#x27;t use. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Great price and works great.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, smooth shaving.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> They work, Ive had better products in the past but for the price its decent. I make sure my razors have some sort of soap on them it makes for an easier shave</li>
    <li> This product used to be great now they use vegetable oil in it. Its not good for your skin. &amp;#34;vegetable&amp;#34; oils, are likely derived from genetically modified crops that have been sprayed with heavy doses of harmful pesticides. To keep your skin soft (and pesticide free) stop using shaving cream with vegetable oils in them. Vegetable oils also clog your pores. Not healthy at all.</li>
    <li> Always use Skintimate shaving cream. Like the smell of this one</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream!  It smells good and gets the job done without skin irritation.  I like the savings of a two-pack and is nice knowing I have a back up one for when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and good price</li>
    <li> My spouse&#x27;s favorite. She says that is works well, smells nice, and it is great to be able to find it here on Amazon (hard to find in our local store). Not much more to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff that she would recommend to others</li>
    <li> The boss says she loves it. Makes smooth legs, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Love the smell and softness..</li>
    <li> I always use this. Good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product directly from the store in the past and it smelled heavenly. When using the product purchased via Amazon the fragrance smelled old and unappealing.</li>
    <li> Sucks!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Makes your skin feel like rubber and it makes my skin so dry I end up getting a lot of cuts. The smell is awful too.</li>
