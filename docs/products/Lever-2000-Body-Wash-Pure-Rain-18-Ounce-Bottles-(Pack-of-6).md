      <li>When I left the bath, one of roommates inquired about the awesome fragrance I was wearing.  </li>
      <li>My favorite body wash ever.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy Lever 2000 Body Wash everywhere, but I can&#x27;t find it at all these days.  </li>

      <li>I turned to Amazon and was so glad to find it here.  </li>
      <li>I love Amazon,</li>
      <li>and we love Lever 2000 products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s becoming more of a challenge finding this product in stores around the Atlanta area...</li>
      <li>I first tried it when staying at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I get good lather, the scent is pleasant without being excessive and the price was good.  </li>
      <li>But worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and it smells awesome!!!</li>
      <li>My husband and three sons work on cars and this is the best product that I have found that cuts the grease, grime and major body odor and makes them smell clean and fresh!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love love love this lever 2000 pure rain body wash its quite refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Im glad i was able to get it in a 6 pack since its becoming rare to find on store shelves.</li>
      <li>I doubt this will be effective during the hot summer months.</li>
      <li>but we like the body wash just fine</li>
      <li>This product not only produces a lot of soap but smells great and rinses off easy.</li>
      <li>You feel so clean and smell great when you take a hot shower with pure rain.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t feel more fresh after usage.  </li>
      <li>I had decided it just wasn&#x27;t available anymore</li>
      <li>This body wash smells fantastic and lasts for hours afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It is so amazing, really moisturize my skin.</li>
      <li>I ordered a box of 6 on line of the original formula</li>
      <li>I prefer the original but this works as well.</li>
      <li>were sames clean.</li>
      <li>Gives you that Lever 2000 clean feeling without the dryness the bar soap leaves.</li>
      <li>What can I say, gets you clean.  </li>
      <li>The scent of Pure Rain is refreshing, and the liquid body wash lathers up so well.  </li>
      <li>I guess its all in the chemicals they use to bring about that special aroma.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Lever 2000 pure rain bodywash for many years...</li>
      <li>Makes a nice lather and rinses off completely.  </li>
      <li>I have never used a body wash that last all day and smells this good.  </li>
      <li>It also has a fresh, clean scent.</li>
      <li>I have using this soap for several years and it is simply the best smelling body wash on the market.</li>
      <li>Just watch, because it comes out gel like, and will slip out of your hand quickly, if you are not paying attention.</li>
      <li>I also, unlike another reviewer, very much like the scent of the original and find it quite feminine.</li>
      <li>Took a minute to get used to, but was a great bargain when compared to supermarket prices...  Hardly notice the strong smell anymore.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant of ordering a case of body wash without first smelling it, since it was my intent of trying to find a wash with a clean, fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>And eventually I discovered Lever 2000 which became my favorite for the extra clean scent.  </li>
      <li>Soon I began to use any and every other brand, but none were up to par with my beloved Lever 2000.  </li>
      <li>The price was just right</li>
      <li>RIGHT OFF THE SHELF</li>
      <li>The body wash is very soapy clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>This made my skin feel very soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I like hot shower</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found &#x27;em on Amazon for a 6 pack at a low price.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>My husband I prefer Lever 2000 for showers but for several years have not been able to locate it in area stores.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a quality product!</li>
      <li>very refreshing body wash and mild smell, not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>After reading other reviews and trying countless other brands/scents, I took a chance on the Lever 2000 Pure Rain body wash and couldn&#x27;t have been more relieved and very happy to have found the body wash I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
      <li>I found it at Amazon.com at the right price, and much appreciated.  </li>
      <li>It does not dry my skin out and leaves me feeling fresh and smelling clean.  </li>
      <li>the scent is way too strong for this male</li>
      <li>they could make more money that way because I would buy every single one off the shelf.</li>
      <li>Pure Rain in a hotel room shower.  </li>
      <li>but I prefer the pure rain scent.</li>
      <li>Well I&#x27;m hooked for life on Lever Pure Rain; and</li>
      <li>The shipper was very prompt with shipping my large order.  </li>
      <li>I really like the scent of the Pure Rain Lever 2000 and so does my husband.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this product because my husband had tried it and loved it. Then I could not find it any store grocery store or Walmart anywhere in our area. So I googled it and there it was. I had decided it just wasn&#x27;t available anymore but there it was. So I ordered 2 cases and he&#x27;s happy. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is the best scented body wash for the money. It&#x27;s inimitable scent leaves my entire bathroom and adjacent rooms smelling fresh....not to mention myself.  10 years ago I used L2000 Pure Rain in a hotel room shower.  When I left the bath, one of roommates inquired about the awesome fragrance I was wearing.  Upon hearing that it was my body wash, not any cologne, he was hooked (on the soap, not me).  Each time I visit friends/relatives or vice versa, they compliment my choice of soap and never hesitate to inform me how excellent I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, other than the fragrance, Lever 2000 Pure Rain is utter perfection when it comes to cleaning every inch of my body, including my entire face.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried other inferior brands, Dial, Irish Spring, Ivory, etc.; but they lack the essential chemistry Pure Rain provides when I use it.  I guess its all in the chemicals they use to bring about that special aroma.  Well I&#x27;m hooked for life on Lever Pure Rain; and wouldn&#x27;t you know it&#x27;s only available on Amazon.  I guess like all my other specific preferences...the best are always hard to come by....but not too hard as long as Amazon exists!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is much easier on the skin than soap and is moisturizing. I am happy that I have a good supply on hand!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My husband and three sons work on cars and this is the best product that I have found that cuts the grease, grime and major body odor and makes them smell clean and fresh! I can&#x27;t find it at any local stores so I buy it here. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This body wash smells fantastic and lasts for hours afterwards.  It is very difficult to locate in stores nowadays.  The subscribe and save feature offers it at the best price- it is still quite expensive though. But worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> This made my skin feel very soft and smooth.  I first tried it when staying at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it.  I checked stores first but could only find the Lever bar soap.  So...I wandered on amazon and found this decent deal.  I subscribed to save more money, making it come to something like $4.33 per bottle.</li>
    <li> THE LEVER 2000 BODY WASH IS THE ABSOLUTE FINEST BODY WASH THAT I HAVE EVER TRIED. THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH IT IS, I CANNOT FIND IT ON THE SHELVES ANYWHERE; NOT EVEN THE DOLLAR STORES. I SAY TO MYSELF EVERYTIME I PURCHASE IT FROM AMAZON; HERE IS THE PRODUCT RIGHT OFF THE SHELF AND AT A CHEAPER PRICE. THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Lever 2000 pure rain bodywash for many years...I think it&#x27;s the best bodywash out there! It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and it smells awesome!!! It is hard to find nowadays...I don&#x27;t no why?? I use to buy &#x27;em at Walmart or CVS. I&#x27;m glad I found &#x27;em on Amazon for a 6 pack at a low price. If you get a chance, try using it with a Salux washcloth...you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> Took a minute to get used to, but was a great bargain when compared to supermarket prices...  Hardly notice the strong smell anymore.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the only shower wash that we use.  It is difficult to find in this city.  Amazon sells it in bulk. This is in my opinion&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Is the best body wash made.  It does not dry my skin out and leaves me feeling fresh and smelling clean.  I love Amazon,</li>
    <li> The price was just right and we love Lever 2000 products. We have always used Lever and probably always will</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the Lever 2000 I remember. I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance, and I don&#x27;t feel fresh all day even though the weather has cooled  down considerably. I doubt this will be effective during the hot summer months. I don&#x27;t know if the formula was changed, but I was always happy with Lever 2000 when it was available in stores because it was a great, deodorizing body wash which is important to me during the hot Arizona summers. Not this batch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s becoming more of a challenge finding this product in stores around the Atlanta area...not sure why.  I really like the scent of the Pure Rain Lever 2000 and so does my husband.  This is also a GREAT price for a pack of 6 on Amazon, plus you save even more with the Subscribe &amp; Save. What a bargain!</li>
    <li> Thought we were ordering the larger size bottle which has 20% more product for the same price but we like the body wash just fine</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I prefer not to use any other shower gel. Have been using this for over 15 years and love it. Wonderful, clean, fresh scent and amazing skin softening properties. Thank you again Amazon for offering this product. I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  It has a nice mild fragrance and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> this is my family&#x27;s favorite shower gel - it has become very difficult to find. So happy I was able to find it again.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy Lever 2000 Body Wash everywhere, but I can&#x27;t find it at all these days.  I thought Lever Brothers had stopped making the product.  I was thrilled to discover I could buy it through Amazon.      The scent of Pure Rain is refreshing, and the liquid body wash lathers up so well.  I plan always to buy my body wash in lots of 6 from Amazon from now on!  I also, unlike another reviewer, very much like the scent of the original and find it quite feminine.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash ever. This is the good stuff. It has me feeling real good after usage. Yeah man.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this lever 2000 pure rain body wash its quite refreshing.  I have never used a body wash that last all day and smells this good.  This item is worth every penny trust and believe me you wont be disappointed.  I wonder why this item isnt in stores anymore they could make more money that way because I would buy every single one off the shelf.</li>
    <li> very refreshing body wash and mild smell, not overwhelming.  What can I say, gets you clean.  we are quite satisfied with this and a good price for 6 bottles.</li>
    <li> Was glad to be able to get this body wash online. Stores I regularly shop no longer carry it!  Thanks for a quality product!</li>
    <li> I prefer the original but this works as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too bad they are doing away with this specific scent, becasue the new &amp;#34;Pure Rain&amp;#34; scent is very different and not god, in my opinion.  That&#x27;s why I loaded up on the discontinued brand.</li>
    <li> My husband I prefer Lever 2000 for showers but for several years have not been able to locate it in area stores. We are pleased to be able to purchase it via Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to use Lever 2000 bar &amp; when winter time my skin is so dry coz I like hot shower so I order this body wash. It is so amazing, really moisturize my skin. The smell is a little bit stronger so I will try original next time. I use Nivea Body Lotion (dark blue color) for very dry skin after shower so my skin moisture all day.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB5TNQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> i love to use this item body soap.feeling clean,&lt;br /&gt;i alway use bar too, if no more liquit,i bar too.say bar or liquit were sames clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap mostly based upon reviews here on Amazon.  The Lever Body Wash is good.  I get good lather, the scent is pleasant without being excessive and the price was good.  I still prefer the Nivea Body Wash to the Lever, but this is a quality product.</li>
    <li> Growing up we only had bar soap in our house.  As I got older I discovered shower gel.  And eventually I discovered Lever 2000 which became my favorite for the extra clean scent.  However, the shower gel became more and more scarce around my area. Soon I began to use any and every other brand, but none were up to par with my beloved Lever 2000.  Old Spice Swagger was the closest.  When I found this product on amazon for an amazing price I bought the pack of 6.  This pack appeared to be old because it was very chunky. It literally washed off the rag down the drain in clumps.  I imagine if you use a loofa creating suds its not a problem.  I was disappointed in this product and will probably not buy it through Amazon again.  Or maybe i&#x27;ll try a different seller on amazon.</li>
    <li> Soap is soap, but, over the years, I have tried different soaps/body washes, and have come to prefer Lever 2000.  For some reason, it has become unavailable in stores where I live.  I found it at Amazon.com at the right price, and much appreciated.  It arrived in a very timely fashion.</li>
    <li> They stopped making this stuff but its awesome.  Buy some while you can!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t seem to locate this product locally at this time.  I have been using this for over a decade.  Couldn&#x27;t feel more fresh after usage.  The shipper was very prompt with shipping my large order.  Quanty ordered reflected my concerns that this might be discontinued in the future.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant of ordering a case of body wash without first smelling it, since it was my intent of trying to find a wash with a clean, fresh smell.  After reading other reviews and trying countless other brands/scents, I took a chance on the Lever 2000 Pure Rain body wash and couldn&#x27;t have been more relieved and very happy to have found the body wash I&#x27;ve been looking for.  The body wash is very soapy clean smelling.  It&#x27;s a very thick body wash that lathers up beautifully and a little bit goes a long way.  Thank you Lever 2000 for providing me with a body wash I&#x27;ll be using for years to come.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this old, original Lever 2000 in the stores - it looks like they are selling only new version now, which is not what I like of used to. So I was very happy that I could find this one on Amazon - it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  It was delivered on time, and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> This body wash is not to perfumy.  It does not dry my skin out.  It is very hard to find in my area so I was delighted to find it here at a great price too.</li>
    <li> This product has one of the best lathering components. It also has a fresh, clean scent. I enjoy only using a small amount, per shower, and the scent is not over powering, yet very clean. I could not pass up the multi pack, and am able to share with family. I have been using another brand, because I was unable to find LEVER 2000 locally. I am very happy to find it again, on Amazon.</li>
    <li> the scent is way too strong for this male</li>
    <li> I was looking for a body wash that lathers well. This product not only produces a lot of soap but smells great and rinses off easy. It comes in different scents but I prefer the pure rain scent. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My family really loves the Lever 2000 Body Wash in Pure Rain.  Have used it for years and can no longer find it in any supermarkets or big box stores in my area.  I turned to Amazon and was so glad to find it here.  Makes a nice lather and rinses off completely.  Leaves you with a great clean feel.  Give this a try.</li>
    <li> Gives you that Lever 2000 clean feeling without the dryness the bar soap leaves.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite shower gels..the smell is terrific and lasts on the skin. Im glad i was able to get it in a 6 pack since its becoming rare to find on store shelves.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Reasonable price.  Just watch, because it comes out gel like, and will slip out of your hand quickly, if you are not paying attention.</li>
    <li> I have using this soap for several years and it is simply the best smelling body wash on the market. You feel so clean and smell great when you take a hot shower with pure rain. I went to the local Target and found they are trying to sell a different pure rain formula when I went to get the pure rain I had been using. I ended up buying two bottles of this stuff ( 22.5 oz.) and it smells like your bathing with a crayola crayon. I ordered a box of 6 on line of the original formula so I hope I do not get the new stuff they are selling at the local target. We shall see.</li>
