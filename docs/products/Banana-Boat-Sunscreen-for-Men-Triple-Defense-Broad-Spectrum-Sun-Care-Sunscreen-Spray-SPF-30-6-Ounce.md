### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This spray is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just about the perfect product for preventing sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best spray sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>What a great idea!  </li>
      <li>I tested it out, and it seems to work perfectly well as a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>SPF30 means that this will do its best to protect you under the sun/water for 30 minutes, which is good for &amp;#34;running errands&amp;#34; time.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>I am happy to say that I ordered this product just in time for the Memorial Day weekend</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great, covers well, moisturizes, and protects from the sun.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>The Banana Boat Triple Defense Spray did a great job preventing the sun&#x27;s rays from doing harm.</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>pleasant</li>
      <li>The smell wasn’t great, but wasn’t noticeable after the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The canister has a locking nozzle, which is a nice touch.</li>
      <li>It offered good protection from sunburn when applied liberally and about every hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I suppose no smell commentary is good smell commentary, in this case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once on, it provides good coverage and does not feel overly sticky.  </li>
      <li>Stuff smells good but didn&#x27;t do its job, put it on before heading out for lake for the day</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another good thing about this sunscreen is that it&#x27;s a spray.  </li>
      <li>and I love this sunscreen!  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, great choice.</li>
      <li>verdict is that it worked well as a touch-up to my protection, but not as great for primary protection.</li>
      <li>What makes a sunscreen &amp;#34;for men?&amp;#34;  I honestly don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>(Honestly, I didn&#x27;t take note of the effectiveness of the deoderizer, as I didn&#x27;t apply to my armpits.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Very nice.  </li>
      <li>Handy size sunscreen.</li>
      <li>If that is the kind of smell you want, this works.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say it combats odor or functioned as an alternative to deodorant.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked it for that purpose.</li>
      <li>but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this spray on sunscreen and another container of Banana Boat sunscreen</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s nice to have a formula that works well under high-impact conditions.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, my husband is in the \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; group, and the day he asked fellow tennis players to try the spray also, the majority of them found it to be pleasant.  </li>
      <li>A pleasant, light, genderless aroma is no AXE Body Spray, thank goodness.  </li>
      <li>All I could smell was aerosol - a very strong scent of hairspray.</li>
      <li>product does NOT smell like sunscreen at all; it has a very strong cologne scent,</li>
      <li>This is very easy to use, just spray and go.</li>
      <li>+ Very easy to use for</li>
      <li>I have always liked their products, but I love this one.</li>
      <li>Let first say that this product is very effective as a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant but very light so as not to be the first thing passers by notice about you.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gone through many bottles of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>you are a man and want some sunburn protection without smelling like you walked out of a coconut grove (I personally love that tropical smell), then this is your spray.  </li>
      <li>Equate Wal Mart brand works better for me.</li>
      <li>Besides it&#x27;s effectiveness, I like the ease of being able to just spray it on rather than trying to rub on a bunch of goo.</li>
      <li>I was able to go inside an office environment and not be concerned I smell sweaty.  </li>
      <li>Did I smell notably more manly?  </li>
      <li>He says it performs perfectly, keeping him sun safe with no hassle, and the added bonus of a fresh scent was actually appreciated.</li>
      <li>So I found myself using lotion as my primary sun protection and using this spray as a handy way to touch up my protection throughout the day.</li>
      <li>What more could anyone want from a sunscreen?</li>
      <li>Many sport sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried peel and flake, or even collect sweat *under* the sunscreen and bubble.  </li>
      <li>You twist the top away from the lock position, push, and spray.</li>
      <li>It smells more like an Axe bodywash.  </li>
      <li>love the spray on sunscreen for reapplying on the go.  </li>
      <li>a floral perfume.&lt;br /&gt;+ Bottle has a matte finish for a better grip in case your hand does somehow get greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So if you love Axe, you&#x27;ll love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe the scent appeals more to folks in the 65+ age bracket or maybe they&#x27;re just losing their sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many reviewers don&#x27;t like the way this smells.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Cons\\&quot; would be 1) a bit pricey; 2) although easy to spray on</li>
      <li>Spray on makes it easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The spray makes it easy to apply yourself.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The coverage on this product is easy to obtain (spray and rub it in).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on easily, isn&#x27;t at all greasy, and it works fantastically well.</li>
      <li>Easy to use spray</li>
      <li>had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sprays on easily and evenly and prevented sunburn.  </li>
      <li>The spray is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a clean masculine scent without being overpowering, and its suncreen protection does great.</li>
      <li>I personally loved the ease of application, and full coverage protection, so nice not to have become lobster red after stacking 3 cords of wood on a sunny day.  </li>
      <li>Smells great but made me red &amp; didn&#x27;t keep me from burning.</li>
      <li>Light coverage without being greasy or smelling tropical.  </li>
      <li>But again - it was insanely cheap</li>
      <li>There is no greasy, oily feel like most spray-ons, and it does actually smell good.</li>
      <li>All in all, a very useful result and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use the spray to quickly hit the danger spots like knees and</li>
      <li>You may be familiar with the Hawaiian Tropic brand product which comes in an almost identical can (although the background colour is brown) and smells like the islands.</li>
      <li>Why does sunscreen have to be specially targeted for one gender??</li>
      <li>The sunscreen provided good coverage on a recent weekend day.  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly on the skin.</li>
      <li>The one downside is that it tends to run out quick.  </li>
      <li>At 30 SPF, it provides adequate protection from the sun.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first I just laughed at the fact that they are marketing a sunscreen specifically for me (apparently regular sunscreen isn&#x27;t good enough or is too girly?).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;According to the packaging, it combats odor, and it does indeed have a perfumey but not unpleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely a new top buy in this house.</li>
      <li>My husband and sons are happy not to smell like the typical coconut sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Spraying is easy and fast.  </li>
      <li>It came out very evenly and was easy to spray on my arms and even on my face.</li>
      <li>Instead of smelling like sweat and chemicals (like some sunscreens do to you by the end of the day) this stayed fresh smelling but not at all overpowering.</li>
      <li>I happen to like the fresh scent as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d gotten tired of smelly sunscreens, coconut at best</li>
      <li>My husband is an avid golfer and is pretty particular about the suncreen he uses when he is going to be out in the sun for many hours.</li>
      <li>Exactly what we needed for quick application of sun protection before heading out for working in the yard.  </li>
      <li>Since this Banana Boat spray offers broad spectrum protection, both from UVA and UVB rays, with SPF 30, it seems to be a good product for him.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was surprised by how light the product is and how quickly it evaporates.</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and crisp.</li>
      <li>Great smell without excessive grease</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m not talking about the tanning ones because those always smell like a delicious adult beach beverage, but the straight SPF sunscreens) - those usually have an add smell to them, maybe because of the aerosol, idk.  </li>
      <li>Actually, all the things that most of us look for, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, he gave the Triple Defense Spray a five star rating right away.</li>
      <li>Because I need to be able to use a product without having a negative reaction to it, this product lost significant points, which is a shame because otherwise the form-factor of the product is easy to use.</li>
      <li>and maybe I need a higher SPF.  </li>
      <li>If you need stronger protection, and you know who you are, get a higher SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> This spray is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. There is no greasy, oily feel like most spray-ons, and it does actually smell good. My girlfriend loves to use it too.</li>
    <li> Smells great but made me red &amp; didn&#x27;t keep me from burning. Equate Wal Mart brand works better for me.</li>
    <li> Solid and reliable -- does what&#x27;s expected to do. I&#x27;m not sure tweaking the scent is necessary for me, but I suppose there are some men who&#x27;d prefer it.</li>
    <li> Stuff smells good but didn&#x27;t do its job, put it on before heading out for lake for the day didn&#x27;t help at all I&#x27;m red like a lobster now lol</li>
    <li> I am happy to say that I ordered this product just in time for the Memorial Day weekend and it worked exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a total of six hours in the sun over the three days. The Banana Boat Triple Defense Spray did a great job preventing the sun&#x27;s rays from doing harm. The spray is easy to apply. I didn&#x27;t burn, but I did tan ever so slightly. I believe the moisturizers kept my skin from drying, as well. All in all, a very useful result and exactly what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Banana Boat to everyone.</li>
    <li> Why does sunscreen have to be specially targeted for one gender?? what makes this for men? because the packaging in black? or it smells like AXE? believe it or not men, you can use any sunscreen you want!! even the same ones that women use!! wow!! getting skin cancer is gender blind. this product is just as stupid as bic pens for her</li>
    <li> You may be familiar with the Hawaiian Tropic brand product which comes in an almost identical can (although the background colour is brown) and smells like the islands. This is not that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s good?&lt;br /&gt;It sprays on evenly and consistently. You twist the top away from the lock position, push, and spray. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with coverage of the product or the quality of the spray. It came out very evenly and was easy to spray on my arms and even on my face. It does not feel sticky when going on, nor does it feel &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; or inappropriately oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s bad?&lt;br /&gt;The smell. All I could smell was aerosol - a very strong scent of hairspray. I will point out that the smell does not linger throughout the day, but it immediately caused me to start coughing and my nose to burn/tingle. The product smells AWFUL when sprayed, and for me that&#x27;s a showstopper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I directly compared this product to Hawaiian Tropic in the above areas of coverage, even spray, wetness, and scent. Banana Boat failed in the area of scent. Because I need to be able to use a product without having a negative reaction to it, this product lost significant points, which is a shame because otherwise the form-factor of the product is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Although the current price is steep (19.99 per bottle), I do like the product. Lotions are time-consuming to apply and the Banana Boat spray-on is simple and quick to apply. It dries quickly on the skin. There is a noticeable scent which some may not like. I did not find it unpleasant but would prefer a non-scent spray. At 30 SPF, it provides adequate protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> I find it funny that the ever-so-slight &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell makes this &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;, but whatever. I have been using it on the whole family - me, kid, and husband. We all like it! Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t feel gross, sprayer still works after a bunch of applications, and you can spray it on from weird angles. I&#x27;ve used it for a hot and sweaty day outside gardening and it lasted very well. The scent is so light/neutral that it&#x27;s really not just for men. Would totally buy this again.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat has to be the leader in the sunscreen field. I have always liked their products, but I love this one. This stuff is great. For one thing it works well. Besides it&#x27;s effectiveness, I like the ease of being able to just spray it on rather than trying to rub on a bunch of goo. I can highly recommend this one for men.</li>
    <li> In fact, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily, isn&#x27;t at all greasy, and it works fantastically well. It&#x27;s just about the perfect product for preventing sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to mark this product down because it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side and go through it quickly, but, honestly, it&#x27;s just that worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband and I find this very convenient to apply. I just spray it on hands and arms before going out into the garden to weed and plant and work.  I like that I don&#x27;t need to get it on my palms as I spray it on, so there is no waste or mess. My husband applies it before bike rides and likes it.</li>
    <li> Both of my kids prefer spray on sunscreen, so this was a hit with my 19 year old son. He often goes out for games in the middle of the day and although he puts on sunscreen, and reapplies it, he often still gets burnt. This didn&#x27;t happen when he used this Banana Boat spray. It does smell quite manly, though, so women probably wouldn&#x27;t want to use it.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use, just spray and go. The instructions clearly state to avoid spraying in the face and just spray your hands and apply to your face with your hands. Once or twice I sprayed my face in a hurry, and found I couldn&#x27;t breathe under the &amp;#34;sunscreen mist&amp;#34;. Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does NOT smell like sunscreen at all; it has a very strong cologne scent, akin to Axe for Men body products. So if you love Axe, you&#x27;ll love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is SPF30. SPF30 means that this will do its best to protect you under the sun/water for 30 minutes, which is good for &amp;#34;running errands&amp;#34; time. If you&#x27;re at the beach all day, you will have to reapply a few times, though at that point you&#x27;re prob better off with a cream that&#x27;s SPF45 or SPF50.</li>
    <li> I like the spray on sunblocks and tend to apply very liberally as I am known for my pasty white skin and I&#x27;d like to keep it that way.  I wore this 30 SPF to the pool and did reapply but did still get a slight burn.  It was intense sun and maybe I need a higher SPF.  I suspect that this will work well for someone mored used to tanning but for completly preventing a burn not so much.</li>
    <li> Since retirement my husband has been playing tennis at least 5 mornings a week.  He has Italian-Peruvian skin and a rather dark baseline tan but even so those UVA rays are turning his skin leathery and full of sunspots.  Since this Banana Boat spray offers broad spectrum protection, both from UVA and UVB rays, with SPF 30, it seems to be a good product for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about this sunscreen is that it&#x27;s a spray.  He can apply it without getting lotion on his hands, so no slippery hands, something that&#x27;s annoying when playing tennis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray is also moisturizing and I&#x27;ve noticed that his arms aren&#x27;t as leathery looking lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the issue of scent.  Many reviewers don&#x27;t like the way this smells.  Fortunately, my husband is in the \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; group, and the day he asked fellow tennis players to try the spray also, the majority of them found it to be pleasant.  Maybe the scent appeals more to folks in the 65+ age bracket or maybe they&#x27;re just losing their sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve found that the \\&quot;pros\\&quot; for this are:  1) broad spectrum protection;  2) ease of application;  3) moisturizing;  4) pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Cons\\&quot; would be 1) a bit pricey; 2) although easy to spray on there&#x27;s more waste of product (into air) than there would be with a lotion if you want to make sure you have covered completely all areas of skin exposed to the sun.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to use spray&lt;br /&gt;+ Does not get the hand sticky nor greasy&lt;br /&gt;+ The packing clearly says &amp;#34;for MEN&amp;#34; so one knows that it does not have a floral perfume.&lt;br /&gt;+ Bottle has a matte finish for a better grip in case your hand does somehow get greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It basically the same product as their usual spray-on sunscreen in their regular orange packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love the spray on sunscreen for reapplying on the go.  My husband loves it for golf so he does not have to take his glove off and does not get his hands greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall recommended along with their regular spray-on sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we needed for quick application of sun protection before heading out for working in the yard.  Definitely a&lt;br /&gt;Manly scent, but worked as a sporty scent for me also.  I personally loved the ease of application, and full coverage protection, so nice not to have become lobster red after stacking 3 cords of wood on a sunny day.  My husband would have preferred a spray lotion (don&#x27;t know that they have something like that) so I took off one star because of that, in my book it&#x27;s a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this product, very manly. It seems to work as far as sun protection goes, no burning. It goes on fairly dry too, which is both good and bad, its good because your skin doesn&#x27;t end up all oily or greasy, but its bad because normally, to insure full coverage, I like to spray on, then rub in, this stuff goes on too dry to really to a post spray rub down, you end up just having to spray more, which maybe makes the bottle last less, depending on your personal use being drier is either good or bad. Otherwise I definitely like it.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  Spray on makes it easy to apply.</li>
    <li> At this time of the year, my husband, who has had skin cancer in the past,  spends three hours every week cutting grass in the hot sun which always causes both of us some concern.  When he is  finally back in our home, John (my husband) has always, in the past,  had a very, very red face and ears regardless of wearing a wide brim hat and a face mask. In using the Banana Boat Triple Defense Ultramist Clear Spray Sunscreen SPF for Men on three different occasions,John was pleased to see that the invisible clear spray when applied to his face and ears fifteen minutes before cutting the grass definitely prevented most of  the unwanted and dangerous skin redness .He highly recommends it as a reliable source of skin protection from the sun. As his wife I, too, recommend it, since one experience with skin cancer was enough.  See a skin specialist on a regular basis and please protect yourself from too much sun.

    <li> I decided to give this product a try.  It is packaged for men and definitely has a masculine scent.  It does not smell like your typical tropical coconut smell.  It smells more like an Axe bodywash.  If that is the kind of smell you want, this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage on this product is easy to obtain (spray and rub it in).  The spray works well but I found the spray top on my unit a little persnickety.  Once on, it provides good coverage and does not feel overly sticky.  That is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a man and want some sunburn protection without smelling like you walked out of a coconut grove (I personally love that tropical smell), then this is your spray.  Light coverage without being greasy or smelling tropical.  Smells like a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice.  4 stars simply because I found the spray top harder to use than it should be.</li>
    <li> + Very easy to use for even coating&lt;br /&gt;+ Great smell without excessive grease&lt;br /&gt;+ No white residue or stain on swimwear&lt;br /&gt;+ Value for money!</li>
    <li> This spray seems to work well for everyone in my family (not just the men). Still, it&#x27;s nice to have a formula that works well under high-impact conditions.</li>
    <li> This banana boat product does double duty-- both sunscreen and as a scent. It&#x27;s got a clean masculine scent without being overpowering, and its suncreen protection does great. Easy to apply, great choice.</li>
    <li> This is the best spray sunscreen I&#x27;ve used. The scent is fresh and crisp. I was surprised by how light the product is and how quickly it evaporates. It does not spray on heavy or creamy and make you look wet and slick like some other brands. So long as you&#x27;re not sweating before you put it on it only takes a few seconds to evaporate and you&#x27;re left protected and feeling smooth (not sticky at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this everyday, all day at the beach and have yet to be burnt when following the application instructions to the T (re-apply every 2 hours, after swimming/sweating &amp; toweling off, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Banana Boat!</li>
    <li> Caveat - I&#x27;m a lady and I love this sunscreen!  I&#x27;d gotten tired of smelly sunscreens, coconut at best, weird chemicals at worst. Many sport sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried peel and flake, or even collect sweat *under* the sunscreen and bubble.  This stuff smells great, covers well, moisturizes, and protects from the sun.  I work outside for my job and I&#x27;ve gone through many bottles of this stuff.  I actually want to wear it because it works so well!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works as well as one would expect, with the added advantage that it doesn&#x27;t smell of coconut, pineapple, or just a vague alcohol odor. This is something you can spray on and then walk into a building without everyone turning around to see who just applied sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Finally!!  A spray sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t smell like you just left a whorehouse. As an avid fisherman, hunter, golfer etc, I have finally found something that works well and seems geared to sportsmen. I&#x27;m gonna buy a case of the stuff.</li>
    <li> What makes a sunscreen &amp;#34;for men?&amp;#34;  I honestly don&#x27;t know.  I was anticipating finding this product to have an obnoxious, overpowering scent like Axe products given that it&#x27;s marketed towards men but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this spray on sunscreen and another container of Banana Boat sunscreen I already had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sprays on easily and evenly and prevented sunburn.  What more could anyone want from a sunscreen?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this sun-screen because this was the first time I have tried a spray on sun-screen so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. After using it, and sun-screen lotions, on a recent trip to Hawaii, I have to say that I am not a big fan of the spray-on sun-screen as my primary protection. It&#x27;s difficult to apply if there is any type of wind, and you have to hold the bottle upright for it to spray...which is difficult to do when trying to apply to your back, or even some parts of your front. It also seemed to not work as well as the lotion in protecting my skin. It also definitely washed off once you went swimming. So I found myself using lotion as my primary sun protection and using this spray as a handy way to touch up my protection throughout the day. I liked it for that purpose. It&#x27;s easy to use the spray to quickly hit the danger spots like knees and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My verdict is that it worked well as a touch-up to my protection, but not as great for primary protection. Stick to lotion for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; aspect.....that seems like pure gimmick. There was nothing about this spray that made it more effective/beneficial for men than any other spray.</li>
    <li> What a great idea!  My husband and sons are happy not to smell like the typical coconut sunscreen.  Quality is on par with our other sunscreens--goes on easiy and works well.  This will definitely be a staple for the men in the household.</li>
    <li> My husband is an avid golfer and is pretty particular about the suncreen he uses when he is going to be out in the sun for many hours. It can&#x27;t be drippy when sweating, shiny on his face or slick to the touch. Actually, all the things that most of us look for, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, he gave the Triple Defense Spray a five star rating right away. He says it performs perfectly, keeping him sun safe with no hassle, and the added bonus of a fresh scent was actually appreciated. Instead of smelling like sweat and chemicals (like some sunscreens do to you by the end of the day) this stayed fresh smelling but not at all overpowering. I happen to like the fresh scent as well. It&#x27;s mild and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a new top buy in this house.</li>
    <li> At the time of this review, the Banana Boat Triple Defense Spray (for Men!) is listed on Amazon at $19.99 for a single 6 ounce bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s *sunscreen*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the packaging, it combats odor, and it does indeed have a perfumey but not unpleasant scent.  I tested it out, and it seems to work perfectly well as a sunscreen.  Did I smell notably more manly?  Not really, but I did, at first, smell a little floral.  I can&#x27;t honestly say it combats odor or functioned as an alternative to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at the end of the day, in a review, I like to indicate whether or not I would buy this product, and despite it performing as a sunscreen, I would *not* buy this based solely on the price.  Why would anyone pay $20 for a bottle when I can buy a 2-pack of [[ASIN:B00B81XR1Y Banana Boat Ultramist SPF 30 Sport Performance Clear Twinpack, 12 Ounce]] with the same SPF rating, from the same company (Banana Boat) for $12?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would not, so I mark a functional product down two stars.  I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t work, I just wouldn&#x27;t buy it based on alternatives available from the same manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I know, I know... I got suckered by the marketing on the bottle, too.  I saw a sunscreen bottle printed with &amp;#34;MEN!!!&amp;#34; and I grabbed it.  Oh, well.  This ain&#x27;t a product for men only.  This will totally help the stinky women in your life as well.  (Honestly, I didn&#x27;t take note of the effectiveness of the deoderizer, as I didn&#x27;t apply to my armpits.  I suppose no smell commentary is good smell commentary, in this case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aerosolized spray makes even application a snap, the quickest and easiest way to put on sunscreen.  This sunscreen is clear and not oily or greasy.  A pleasant, light, genderless aroma is no AXE Body Spray, thank goodness.  The sunscreen provided good coverage on a recent weekend day.  The one downside is that it tends to run out quick.  We&#x27;re able to apply to our family of four 3 times before being totally tapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balance the downside of a few applications with easy, even coverage (compared to lotion bottles which will last longer but can be clumpy, greasy, and uneven) to decide if this product is right for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my entire spray bottle in the Texas sun this June, and here are my observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is durable and convenient.  I stored it in an outside pocket in my back pack, and it was cleaner and easier to use on the go than a bottle of lotion would have been.  Spraying is easy and fast.  The SPF30 is just enough protection to keep me from burning, and I have average to tan skin.  I do not burn much or very easily, but need some protection under really sunny conditions for a long time.  If you need stronger protection, and you know who you are, get a higher SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that this is somewhat fragranced.  I really like this feature more than I initially thought I would.  Guess what: when it&#x27;s hot enough to burn it&#x27;s hot enough to get sweaty.  I was able to go inside an office environment and not be concerned I smell sweaty.  Smart feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product stayed on well for several hours, so no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give five stars is that the current price is only an OK value in my opinion.  This is a well conceived and quality product.</li>
    <li> As a sunscreen lotion, Banana Boat for Men Triple Defense disappears quickly, has decent water resistance, and is not greasy. It offered good protection from sunburn when applied liberally and about every hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use this sunscreen as a stand-alone because I feel like I don’t have a high degree of control on the application. In my part of the world, it is windy a lot of the time, and I don’t want to spray a sunscreen on in my car or house. The wind adds an extra challenge for application of a spray-on sunscreen. That being said, when I got the wind-direction issues resolved, the sunscreen performed well. The smell wasn’t great, but wasn’t noticeable after the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The canister has a locking nozzle, which is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Let first say that this product is very effective as a sunscreen.  I have an unfortunate family history of skin cancer - my grandmother died of it and all of her children had to have spots removed - so I have tried many different kinds of sunscreen.  This works.  No burns, but you still tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the spray smells awful to my nose.  Like a bad cologne.  I&#x27;d prefer to go with a plainer option than this, if I have to wear it and smell it on myself all day long.  Others in my friend group like the scent, but I find it repellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary.  But I recommend a &amp;#34;sniff test&amp;#34; before buying.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a local drugstore on sale for insanely cheap with coupons.  At first I just laughed at the fact that they are marketing a sunscreen specifically for me (apparently regular sunscreen isn&#x27;t good enough or is too girly?).  My friends also laughed at me saying I was duped into buying a product and it was marketing only since sunscreens are basically all the same with some minor differences.  But again - it was insanely cheap and I go through probably a bottle of spray sunscreen in a weekend (living in Florida will do that to ya).  But I have to say I actually enjoy the scent of this product more-so than the other brands of sunscreen (I&#x27;m not talking about the tanning ones because those always smell like a delicious adult beach beverage, but the straight SPF sunscreens) - those usually have an add smell to them, maybe because of the aerosol, idk.  Anyways, I love this scent so I&#x27;ve actually bought several more cans of this to continue using it (well also my BF will actually ask for this sunscreen over any other in my bag since I tend to carry like 3 different types just in case).  So I would def recommend it if you don&#x27;t like the aerosol smell but other than that it works exactly like the other standard SPF 30 Banana Boat sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Handy size sunscreen. The spray makes it easy to apply yourself. The sunscreen does not have an greasy oily feel to it. The smell is pleasant but very light so as not to be the first thing passers by notice about you.</li>
