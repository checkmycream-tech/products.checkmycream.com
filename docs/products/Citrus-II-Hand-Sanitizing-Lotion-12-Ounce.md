<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use hand sanitizer many times a day - both at home and at work. This has a lovely clean scent, and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.  It&#x27;s a lot nicer than Purell. The price is excellent with subscribe and save. The container is attractive. The pump is sturdy.</li>
    <li> Great hand sanitizer. Leaves hands feeling clean and soft. Has a great scent, especially when compared to the typical hand sanitizer. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue as some moisturizing hand sanitizers do.</li>
    <li> Good size and container. Only thing I would change is the smell... It&#x27;s good, but very slightly strong. Good product tho.</li>
    <li> Ordered two of these for my daughter to take to school for use in the classroom. Nice citrus smell but a little on the pricey side.</li>
    <li> I have this item on Subscribe &amp; Save because I love and use it so much.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out like most hand sanitizers do, and it has a very pleasant smell.  I would definitely recommend this hand sanitizer!!</li>
    <li> I keep several of these in key areas. By the computer, by the sofa and by my bed. I&#x27;m not a fear of germs person, but, I do have a healthy respect for that which could make one sick. This product meets the need and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This pop reduce works. My kids get lots f colds. They touch everything and this Hands are filthy-Mac-NASTY. Rack kid has his or her own bottle. After washing up, we Make them sanitize their hands. Honestly, I do believe there&#x27;s been cleaner hands and fewer colds. At least it&#x27;s what my wife claims.</li>
    <li> Does the job is suppose to with out drying out my hands. Citrus smell though does not smell good. It was still worth buying for me. No regrets.</li>
    <li> This product was better than I expected as the scent is so pleasant  I work in a school and the kids love to use it because of the scent</li>
    <li> Nice, clean smell.  Not too over powering so my husband does not mind the smell.  I would buy again. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve put this on autoship because I like to have a bottle of it in the bathroom and also on my desk.  It&#x27;s a good sized bottle for the price and has a fresh, clean smell.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and have to say this sanitizer smelled horrible. No other word for it. I had to throw it out. I kept it in my bathroom, and a friend used it and commented on how gross it smelled. That was it for me, I just tossed it. Maybe I got a bad batch? But honestly there was a sickening citrus odor to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Pleasant odor and totally non-irritating! So happy to find this WITHOUT tocopherol acetate</li>
    <li> Very nice smell. We use it in our office.  I would give it 5 stars but it it a little pricey, but like the ease of ordering at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, good price, the citrus smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are the five more words.</li>
    <li> The hand sanitizer was better than I expected.  The citrus after smell is a plus in comparison to other lotions.  It has been two months now and I have only been through about 10% of the bottle.  I definitely will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This smells much more pleasant than the usual alcohol hand sanitizers, thank goodness, I&#x27;m tired of the Eau de Purell scent.</li>
    <li> It leaves a mild citrus sent, and is not drying.  One-star deduction because the pump isn&#x27;t the best - it projects slightly more \\&quot;out\\&quot; than \\&quot;down,\\&quot; which can lead to a mess if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> While a hint of citrus scent would be nice, I find that the scent is overpowering, especially if used indoors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hand sanitizer hoping it would have a light natural scent, however it has a very strong unpleasant odor.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off.  If are sensitive to fragrances, don&#x27;t purchase this one.</li>
    <li> LOVE the citrus smell!  This is a very handy size to have also, i have them at work and at various places in the home</li>
    <li> Perfect for an office desk. Seems to get the job done. Nice citrus smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering like some other hand sanitizes.</li>
    <li> Nice soft and non-drying formula to keep germs away from hands, specially when you work manipulating computer peripherals.&lt;br /&gt;Not smelly citrus fragrance.</li>
    <li> The hand cleaner may be good, but it arrived poorly (to say the least) packaged, pumper was cracked clear thru and hand cleaner was all dripping in the box, I recovered what I could and put in my own pumper.  I never figured out how to complain, could not return that soggy mess.</li>
    <li> This came quickly, in good shape, and seems to work well (pump functions, product goes on hands well and sort of evaporates as expectes with an alcohol based item).  It smells good.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Has nice fragrance instead of alcohol  has enough alcohol in it to kill germs I keep it in the car</li>
    <li> Item arrived packed loose in a box with 1 airbag that was not sufficient to keep it from moving around in the box. When I received it the spout had turned enough that it popped out of the locked position and actually opened the spout allowing some of the product to leak out before it ever got to me.</li>
    <li> My hands weren&#x27;t sanite before at all but know they are very sanite indeed. Yep. Pretty sanite all right. Also, it turns out sanite isn&#x27;t even a word. Who knew?</li>
    <li> Only my opinion, your experience may differ...I used this product as soon as I got it, and it was one of the worst experiences I&#x27;ve had with hand sanitizer - in my opinion, it has the worst smell possible - a nose-stinging, very-very-very fake wanna-be citrusy-like smell...like something cooked up in a lab and never smell tested by anything human. The smell lingers for about two hours on the hands. I will remember this horrific smell for many years to come. The smell was so bad that it scared my family - they thought I had spilled some nasty chemicals in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is now resting comfortably at the bottom of my city trash bin, waiting to be hauled to the landfill to no doubt be ostracized by the garbage around it because of the odor it exudes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, only my opinion...</li>
    <li> I live this product. It smells great, it looks nice and it does not dry my hands. Definitely recommend it.</li>
