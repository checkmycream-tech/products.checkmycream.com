<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I needed a new eye liner and I never have time to go to the store so this is very convenient for me. I found a Avon eyeliner and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. I love Avon but I never can find anyone selling it. So I was super excited when I found this Avon eyeliner. Avons makeup is awesome and the prices are great. I also am happy with how quick it came. Thanks again amazon. 😀</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is only worth it&#x27;s price. It goes on super smoothly, which is what I like about it. But, it will DEFINITELY smear in about 2 hours. If you happen to sweat or your skin gets oily through out the day, the eyeliner will smear with the oil and sweat terribly. I have a liquid eyeliner too, so I wear that if I&#x27;m going to be out all day and I wear this if I&#x27;m going out for like max 2 hours. But, like I said it&#x27;s very smooth; therefore, looks very natural when you apply it.</li>
    <li> The eyeliners themselves were wonderful but the packaging was horrible! One of my eyeliners was lost because it was left loose in the box without a plastic bag or anything.</li>
    <li> This is my very first non-pencil eyeliner and I am never going back! This product is so smooth and so black that I&#x27;m saving it in my wishlist for future purchase when I run out of the one I have. Its very precise and wears a long time. And I definitely do NOT miss the splinters of an actual wooden pencil</li>
    <li> Great, it lasts long too!</li>
    <li> I have used Revlon eyeliners in the past, and I didn&#x27;t like the fact that they easily break, and are not very soft. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve bought this brand and so far, I love how smooth and easy to apply it is!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. I have used many many eyeliners over the years, and this one stays put and is truly black in color.</li>
    <li> girlfriend loves it and it looks wonderful on her it brings out her eyes its the only product she has found that lasts the longest as well and keeps it look</li>
    <li> This is a good eye linear!! This is true!!! It&#x27;s not very expensive but it&#x27;s a good choice for your beauty! I like it! IT IS WORTH FOR YOU GUYS TO GET IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is Ok... I dont really like it.. It works pretty good, so I rate it a 3.. But it glides on pretty good, but you kind of have to push down, but other then that its prtty good. I rate it a 3. So if you want like a first eyeliner, i would definately reccomend. These are my OWN opinions Btw.</li>
    <li> I will never use another eye liner after trying this!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner goes on in a perfect way-not too thick or too thin-just perfect.  It stays on great, and is perfect for the price.  I won&#x27;t buy the expensive ones anymore for sure.  It did take quite awhile to get here, but I&#x27;ll let that slide since I&#x27;m in Iraq  I recommend this to anyone that wants a quick and perfect eye-liner job.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge either, just fyi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I feel like I have to say this on 5 star reviews I give because I am wary of people that are hired by the companies selling on here that give 5 star reviews as well.  I am not paid for writing reviews in any way shape or form.  I just simply want other people to share (or not share, as the case may be) on certain products.  I just want to tell people of my experiences, to help them make a decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!!</li>
    <li> is ok if you don&#x27;t mind the glitter</li>
    <li> The price is great, but the liner tends to smudge and wear off throughout the day.  It does go on very smoothly and it&#x27;s a great basic addition to your beauty supplies.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner!! It&#x27;s endured the summer and the winter without melting or drying up. So great!!</li>
    <li> Does go in easy    Is very black    Had to keep on wiping smudges here and there after about half a day of wear.  As the title says - my eyelids are oily, even with the make-up-fixer powder the pencil slowly but surely smudged.    No sharpener, I used the one I had from another similar eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I needed an inexpensive liner. Surprisingly, this eyeliner is long-lasting and doesn&#x27;t smear. It&#x27;s become my favorite eyeliner so far.</li>
    <li> I was very excited for this product, but find it to fall very short of any and all expectations. Not only do you have to apply it more than once to get it to show up, but it doesn&#x27;t apply well. It smears easy and breaks often. It does not go on smoothly. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner isn&#x27;t any different from your local drugstore eyeliner. It pulled on my lash line during application. I&#x27;m not completely satisfied but if all you&#x27;re looking for is a BASIC eyeliner then this is for you (along with all the other ones at your local drugstore). It also dispenses quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll last very long.   One up point for the stars? It doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day (but again, neither does all my other eyeliners).</li>
    <li> I had never used an Avon product before, so I was a little hesitant.  Since the reviews were good, I figured I&#x27;d take a chance.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  The eyeliner goes on smooth and there&#x27;s no smudging!  I really like this product, and I&#x27;ll be buying more of them in the future.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner pencil works well. It was easy to apply. I like that it is self sharpening and it lasts without smudging.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I was looking for a good eyeliner for about 4 weeks since I ran out of my Maybelline one. After constantly looking at reviews, ratings, pricing, I decided to try out this one. I made a good choice. This eyeliner is amazing. Probably my 2nd favorite eyeliner out there that I have tried. I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be as smooth and long-lasting as it is. I&#x27;d buy it again and again. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product via Amazon. This eye liner is smooth and easy to use due to lipstick like casing. The liner leaves no irritation of any sort to the eyes. Suitable for applying both thin and thick lines and stays put for a fair long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also skeptical before ordering owing to the low rate, but it is definitely worth it and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy the same in future again. Go for it !!!!</li>
    <li> So I have used eyeliner for a few years now, I have always had issues with getting the eyeliner to stay in place. It always runs on me. So I bought this in black and brown. It was okay it went on smoothy, but it didn&#x27;t last, after a hour or so it was gone. I also just resently just bought this in a gold. Thinking I could use it as a line on top of the eye lid. Nope, but it works great as a sparkly eyeshadow. Sadly it breaks even if you use it as a regular eyeliner more often then what it should. So over all its okay, it really depends on how you plan on using it and what color.</li>
    <li> was happy to get it fast. it goes on smooth and no sharppening the eyeliner works great.  i would recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. It glides on so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
    <li> So very disappointed!!! Product was not like what I use to order from Avon...more like the generic knock-off!!! Product seems very dry doesn&#x27;t go on smooth at all!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great. Works very well and is very black so it makes my eyes stand out.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite eye liners.  It goes on so easy, and once you get the hang of it you can control how thick of a line you want to apply- from barely there to a nice dark line.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realizer this was a slightly sparkly eyeliner. It does the job but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It also smudges a bit by the end of the day, but not nearly as much as the non-sparkly version that Avon sells.</li>
    <li> i use to use colorstay eyeliner by revlon, but was looking for something better. i saw all the good reviews for this avon eyeliner but it does not work for me. it never wants to color my waterline. a watse of money. i will try maybe sephora or mac.</li>
    <li> These work great! I feel so lucky to find these online for such a great price. I have very oily eyelids and Revlon Colorstay Crayon smudges like crazy within an hour for me. On the contrary, these work sooo good (for me, anyways) and they apply with little to no tug. I will be buying these over and over again!</li>
    <li> I am completely in love with Avon Glimmersticks Eye Liner in Blackest Black. I tried it for the first time today and instantly fell in love. They are retractable so the tip is protected when you put the cap on, and there is no need to carry around a sharpener. I love how they glide on, and the color looks great. There is just enough glitter/shimmer to make your eyes really pop without looking like a preteen. I used this eyeliner at 4 AM and it is 5 PM right now and still looks great. Overall, this product is amazing and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Avon Glimmersticks eyeliner is without a doubt the best eyeliner I have ever used - and trust me I have used A LOT of eyeliner brands in the past.  The ease of application, the colors, and the longevity are what make this a five star product! The price is also very reasonable, on the Avon website, look for when this product is on sale and you can get it for a very low and very reasonable price of usually less than two dollars, which really makes this makeup a steal.    Pros:    -Great colors - there are so many colors to choose from.  I have them in black, blue, green, pink (which does not show up very good against my blue eyes and medium colored skin), purple (which I think they discountinued but it really made my eyes pop) and brown.    I recommend the black, blue, green and purple - they all make your eyes standout.    -Longevity - these eyeliners last a long time both in the tube and staying put on your eyes throughout the day.    -Self sharpening - you do not have the sharpen these, you simply twist the tube and the eyeliner comes out sharpened.    This is my favorite eyeliner, I would not, and do not buy any other. 5 Stars, definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent eyeliner! I can&#x27;t find good black eyeliner ever until I came found this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeliner for a while now it&#x27;s so good it stays on even after you wash your face so of course you have to use a baby wipe for your eyelid but this is a deff yes</li>
    <li> Avon Glimmersticks have a good point to them, They are not a pencil like most eye liners are so I don&#x27;t have to press hard to get the darkness I need.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner serves its purpose, but it&#x27;s not the end-all perfect eyeliner. I did have some issues with chunks breaking off during application as well as raccoon eyes after a few hours of wear. Nothing that couldn&#x27;t be fixed with a quick swipe of a makeup cloth, though. Not bad.</li>
    <li> Straight from the avon rule book::Online auctions, markets and outlets -- As an Avon Independent Sales Representative, you may not list for sale or advertise Avon products or the Avon selling opportunity in online auctions (including but not limited to eBay and Yahoo! Auctions), markets, or other online outlets. This means that, without limitation, you may not:  o Create listings on eBay for Avon products.  o Sell Avon products through an online storefront, for example, through Amazon.com or Yahoo! Shopping or through an independently-managed online storefront.  You are violating the rules.</li>
    <li> Hard to use.  Think it is old.  Not going to.bother returning it but I&#x27;ll never order it again.  Pulls on yout eye when you try to use it, which is very bad for your skin.</li>
    <li> I ONLY USE AVAON EYELINER ALL THE OTHERS BRUN MY EYES AND I JSUT HOW BLACK IT IS I LOVE IT SO MUCH</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good pencil to line the waterline...this is not for you. This pencil glides on smooth, but the color is not dark and does not stay on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It glides on fairly easy but doesn&#x27;t really stay. Tends to kind of run. Mine will look smudged almost halfway through my day.</li>
    <li> The best aspect about this eyeliner is the ease with which it glides on when you apply it to your lid. It&#x27;s smooth, solid, and basically a great fundamental black pencil liner. The second best aspect is that there is no need for a sharpener. It does smudge slightly, but all pencil liners I&#x27;ve ever tried have smudged the same amount or more, so I&#x27;m certainly not complaining.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner I have bought quite a few over the years but none have quite the ONE when I bought this one I figured well let&#x27;s give it a try and I just love it I love how you don&#x27;t have to sharpen it it&#x27;s a twist out and it glides on perfectly just whith one stroke on my eye and it was done unlike other pencils where I have to be going back and foward until I finish coloring in my eyes. This one is fast and easy to use</li>
    <li> Was expecting Blackest Black, instead I received Smokey Grey. Which is fine, but I really wanted black. The eyeliner itself is great! No smudging. Easy to put on. And stays on long. The grey is fine because it looks dark from faraway. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect, I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading other reviews about it not running. Unfortunately for me that was not true. It goes on smooth and easy, but after a few hours I start to look like a raccoon. I carry Q-tips with me to clean it up when I notice it running.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product only 2 stars because it made my eyes water really bad. It also doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth and isn&#x27;t as dark as I hoped. I also wear contact lenses so having this make my eyes water sucks. I usually wear Revlon or Palladio and I will be going back to purchasing Palladio from Sally&#x27;s for the same price as this. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase never had an issue with eyeliner running or rubbing off. I&#x27;m satisfied how it stays on and glides on smoothly with easy turn applicator . Avon is not bad I use to buy avon from a prior co worker that sold it .</li>
    <li> I like it, goes on easy and nice color.</li>
    <li> it wears off very easily on your bottom waterline.</li>
    <li> I will be purchasing more of these. The price is right, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Used it for many years.  love it</li>
    <li> Loved this.  Great price and great product.  Good eyeliner.  Worth the money.  Lasts without running - or smearing.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> I love retractable eyeliners. This one in particularly was great until I dropped it on my bathroom floor. I&#x27;m not sure what exactly happened, but I guess the eyeliner inside the tube broke and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it anymore. I&#x27;m going back to liquid eyeliner.</li>
    <li> It is very easy, smooth to draw,  and it doesn&#x27;t fall off easily. What else do you expect from a eye liner.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get Avon products without calling a rep. Only thing is, I ordered black and I got brown.</li>
    <li> Difficult to apply. It goes on very sheer on my eyes. Does not last long and line is too thick.</li>
    <li> The pencil does not glide very well- it breaks off almost everytime I use it. I am very disapointed in Avon&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and superb service. Very friendly, fast in shipping as well. I would strongly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this 2 days ago and received it sealed and well packaged. But when I opened it to look at the liner tip, a large chunk was broken. So it was a damaged piece sold by Avon. Really disappointed with Avon!!</li>
    <li> Very Good Product. I love it! :</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an eyeliner for a long time that will stay put on me. I like to put it on my waterline and this did not stay on at all, when I outlined the outside it stayed on pretty good but I am looking for an eyeliner for my waterline.</li>
    <li> Lasts all day! But did not like that it would sometimes smear</li>
    <li> recommended by my niece.  she saw it is the best she has ever tried,  I agree with her</li>
    <li> When the look you&#x27;re going for is &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34;, there&#x27;s nothing like blackest black.  Even a hint just below the iris on the lower lid and at the corners of the eye makes a big difference - without being too much.</li>
    <li> Always a reliable black eyeliner. It&#x27;s a must for everyday makeup and nice to throw in your purse to go. Sometimes it gets smudged but I think it&#x27;s because the top of my eyelid is close to where the eyeliner it...I probably should look for a waterproof eyeliner.</li>
    <li> easy application, never needs sharpening, good staying power, didn&#x27;t smudge or bleed, I would recommend it and I would buy again</li>
    <li> I usually use a dark eyeliner for my eyes and this one is carbon black which makes my eyes bright and nice. Self sharpening is the best feature.</li>
    <li> goes on nicely but doesn&#x27;t lat very long. I used to be an avon fan, but it seems like the quality has really gone down lately. plus they&#x27;ve resumed animal testing again after being cruelty free for years, which is dissapointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next time I&#x27;m going to plurge a little on urban decay&#x27;s eyeliner, which goes on nice and lasts forever</li>
    <li> Horrible eyeliner. It goes on really nicely and smoothly but within a hour it is gone and it looks like you never put any on! Will not purchase again and was very disappointed because Avon usually has such great products.</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Great purchase for the price. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way. What do you want in a liner? Glimmersticks has it! Smooth glide, precise tip, super rich and long lasting color.......ya, get this one</li>
    <li> great product and price as well</li>
    <li> Very soft and very black. It only takes one application for this makeup to last all day. I&#x27;ll probably never use pencils again.</li>
    <li> Meh. I bought this to apply to my waterline and it&#x27;s not great for that. It applies easily if you can move it from side to side in sweeps, but for waterline I put it between two eyelashes and wiggle and it doesn&#x27;t stick very well that way. Also, it smudges as you apply it which would be great if I wanted a more smokey look, but I was looking for a sharp line. It stays on well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes but it&#x27;s not great for a sharp waterline look.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It hardly smudges. The only problem I had with it was that it went by really quickly. Lasted hardly a month. I would like to add in there, I do wear my eyeliner very thick, but I have never ran through eyeliner as quickly as I did with this. As much as I loved this eyeliner, and how smoothly it was applied, I will not, in the future, purchase this product. It is to expensive to buy once a month. I mean, 6 dollars isn&#x27;t alot, but it adds up. Especially when you have other priorities to spend money one.</li>
    <li> Recommend this to anyone its perfect. It came in the mail on time and glides on so softly. Ill prolly stock up.</li>
    <li> Not what I had in mind. Very oily and smudges very bad. Looks great for about an hour and a half.</li>
    <li> Best and only eyeliner I have worn for the last 20 years.  Glides on easily and stays on.</li>
    <li> I have not owned any other Avon products before this one. However, I am always looking for a good eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t give me that raccoon look by midday so I thought I would give this a try based on other reviews and the relatively cheap price. I could not be more disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t roll on smoothly while applying, it almost immediately fades, and definitely does not stay on for very long. Overall, It just looks kinda blah. If this is considered a quality Avon product, I will not be purchasing anymore in the future. I love Covergirl Ink It eyeliner wayyy better and it is about the same price.</li>
    <li> Avon Glimmersticks have always been a favorite of mine. Its not too soft or too hard and glides on the eyes smoothly. Looks great for hours.</li>
    <li> I love how this one works to apply. Definitely better than the regular pencil styles.</li>
    <li> Prompt but product is defective as if it melted or expired.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite brand of eyeliner. It goes on smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I must admit I&#x27;m not an Avon fan and this is my first Avon product ever...and I&#x27;m pretty amazed. It glides smoothly and softly and stays the whole day. Looks good on me and flatters my eyes.</li>
    <li> I like this eye liner, but it does not stay on&lt;br /&gt;Very long.</li>
    <li> What I expected, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner lasts me a decently long time and goes on very smoothly, which I love. My only complaint is that while it starts off with a nice tip, as soon as that tip is blunted, it stays blunted. Because it&#x27;s not a pencil, there&#x27;s no way to sharpen it. And even though the blunt tip glides on well and isn&#x27;t that sloppy, it definitely doesn&#x27;t allow for much precision.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intentions of it performing as a dark black eyeliner. It is very faint if you were to use it to line out your top lids, especially if you&#x27;re wearing false eyelashes. It is an &#x27;ok&#x27; eyeliner. I have always preferred liquid eyeliners over pencils however, I do go back to the Avaon Glimmerstick to color in my bottom eye lids at times.</li>
    <li> Its design is simple very smart. Like lipstick.  You rotate the shell to bring the eyeliner out or down when applied its very soft, shows up great the first time so you dont have to rub it over and ove in the same spot.</li>
    <li> This is really black. It is not brown or grey or light black. It is just black. The most disappointing thing about eye liner pencils is that you have to sharpen it from time to time. This one solves all the problem and the pencil is not so soft to break all the time. It gives you a nice outline around the eyes and the effects are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Not long lasting for me.  I was anxious to try this after reading the positive reviews on it, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my eyes even till noon.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my eyes because I cannot find a pencil that lasts all day.  Revlon has one that I like but the pencil breaks off so easily, I end up wasting half of the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> My eyes looked great when I used them as a underliner.  It will also look good as an upper liner!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Have no problem with it, although to be fair... it&#x27;s an eyeliner, it&#x27;s like buying a pen, they all do what they&#x27;re suppose to. Unless your pen isn&#x27;t writing on paper, then you can&#x27;t really give a good or bad review, same with eyeliners. So buy this, buy its competitors, or buy one that cost $.99 cents. They all work. I just bought this so that I could have enough in my order to qualify for free shipping.</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t tug at your eye.  It stays on very well.  I will certainly be buying Avon make-up again.</li>
    <li> NICE AND SMOOTH PENCIL....</li>
    <li> The glimmer stick came when they said it would, it is the best eyeliner I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I would use them again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only eye liners that I have found that doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear. It last all day and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes even with my contacts in. Great product!</li>
    <li> Easy!  Perfect!  Lasts &amp; stays on.  Nice size and I buy several of them at a time for the best value.  Avon puts them on sale regularly and hasn&#x27;t discontinued them.  I have been using Glimmersticks for 15 years.  I don&#x27;t see every changing brands.</li>
    <li> I always loves avon products so of course this rocks! It came on time just like it said. I recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> It is not that smooth and It is not as black as I thought it was going to be!!  Is okay you you don&#x27;t want to put that much makeup.</li>
    <li> this eyeliner is better than many higher priced ones I have bought in the past. goes on smooth and easy.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> A good eye pencil for the price.</li>
    <li> Love it,deep color stays long , the only thing don&#x27;t forget to put the cap back , or it will dry .</li>
    <li> Avon Glimmersticks eye liner is THE product to beat! The user friendly application, the incredible wear and the beautiful array of colors make this competitor a worthy challenger!</li>
    <li> I enjoy on the weekends wearing a more sparkly and glittery eye liner. I do sometimes wear this sometimes to work. This is reasonably priced and goes on smoothly. I love the colors. I have blue eyes but my friends have used it with green and brown eyes and it looks just as nice.</li>
    <li> Glides on easy and the linear stays thin and sharp.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;glimmer\\&quot; or \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; at all its flat black. Right when I recieved it I rolled it all the way up to see how much eyeliner I actually paid for. It was 2 inches. Not that much eyeliner for 5.00 plus shipping. I like my maybellene regular wooden eye pencil and will be sticking with that for a while. Not really worth it, if you like this product just find someone who sells it in your area and get it while its on sale for like 2$ free of shipping. :)</li>
    <li> best eyeliner i&#x27;ve had so far... not only is it actually the darkest black i&#x27;ve had, but it has those little sparkles in it. excellent.</li>
    <li> I read that this eyeliner stays on your waterline well but I don&#x27;t see it. It lasts for a long time and tends to stay in place which is nice, I just wish it went on the waterline darker and stayed for longer. Other than that I really like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding eyeliner that stays put, and even when sweating or rubbing my eyes, this seems to be holding up well! It doesn&#x27;t clump in the corners like others, and goes on smooth and very easily. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> The product lasted me less than 1 month. The liner fell out of the pencil and I could not place it back in well enough to use it</li>
    <li> I love this product it goes on smooth, gives you a just dark enough line and smudges when you want it to and not when you don&#x27;t want it to.  Easy to use and lasts a pretty long time in comparison with other competitive products..I&#x27;ve tried them all!  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs an all day eyeliner which is easy to use and comes off cleanly when you want it to.  You barely have to touch it up throughout the day if at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best, affordable eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Great eye liner, always have it in my purse now.</li>
    <li> my favorite eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with my Purchase.  I will definitely use this seller in the future..</li>
    <li> Pretty darn good black eyeliner for its price.</li>
    <li> This had good reviews, but I am not happy. It doesn&#x27;t stay on my eyes for very long at all.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it away and using something else.</li>
