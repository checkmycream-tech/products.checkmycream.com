    <li> I keep waiting for Bath and Body Works to bring this back and have even signed up for their alerts. I was very disappointed to recently go into a store and learn that it WAS back for a minute in June and I missed it. I immediately went on Amazon and found this, buying the only 2 available! I would love B&amp;BW to bring it back so I can use their discount coupons, even though the price through Amazon wasn&#x27;t outrageous.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is not new to me.  I have purchased this fragrance from Bath &amp; Body Works for many years, up until it was discontinued, and the most I paid for a bottle was $13.99.  Although I love the fragrance, I do not plan to purchase another one because you&#x27;ve doubled the price, some vendors tripled the price, and it&#x27;s not worth it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this scent, I was afraid it was gone forever !!  Perfect scent in a lotion by far!!!</li>
