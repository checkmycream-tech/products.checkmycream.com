      <li>There are better alternatives out there.</li>

      <li>Work just as the name says easy, I highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>I think its more for using the razor on the edges and not so much for full facial shaving, but still does the job.</li>

      <li>I am VERY prone to ingrown hairs and razor bumps and use everything from a straight edge, double edge and a mach 3 razor and this stuff never kills my face.</li>
      <li>The smell is minty fresh for sure and not AMAZING but who cares, so long as it keeps protecting my face</li>
      <li>Clearly she&#x27;s not a barber.</li>
      <li>It also feels smooth and there is less friction than with foam.!</li>
