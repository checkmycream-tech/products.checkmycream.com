      <li>Would recommend for girls night out, hot dates, or just to feel sexy!</li>
      <li>So EASY to remove, no nail staining.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, a deep whine I would say.</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful deep wine color.</li>
      <li>A little darker that what I wanted but still a great color!</li>
      <li>Awesome color-bright dark!</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and needs two coats.</li>
      <li>Application is smooth with no streaking.</li>
      <li>Its about 94 cents to $1.75, its cheap but leaves all nail polishes looking fresh and shinny!</li>
      <li>Looks great on my nails, and dark colors make my fingers look longer and more feminine in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Make sure to shake VERY VERY well before applying, or else it can get streaky.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Prey Tell&amp;#34; color is a beautiful vampy dark plum and is opaque in 2</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a gorgeous deep vamp purple-red-burgundy-oxblood color.</li>
      <li>I love the consistency of this color, and love the shine of the final coat of the nail polish.</li>
      <li>polishes I own so a little harder to brush on smoothly, but it still turned out great on my nails.</li>
      <li>Long lasting and very good quality.</li>
      <li>and I suggest people look to find the right color that the one on Amazon because it&#x27;s way cheaper</li>
      <li>um I have it on my nails right now</li>
      <li>Beautiful deep red, very sultry and flirty!</li>
      <li>Try the NYC&#x27;s extra shinny top coat to finish the look.</li>
      <li>The color looks exactly like it does in the bottle on the nail.</li>
      <li>This was my first foray into China Glaze, and I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
      <li>Great thick coats and buildable.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s even better is that with just a top coat on my natural nails,the color lasted about a week and half.</li>
      <li>I really like this color.</li>
      <li>It looks very dressed up and fancy, but it can be used as accent colors as well.</li>
      <li>This China Glaze Prey Tell color is officially my new addiction!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a dark red wine color which makes it look very rich especially when you wear it.</li>
      <li>Decent staying power.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit streaky the first coat, then levels out opaque with a second coat.</li>
      <li>The only down side is that it chips pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Two coats is all you need if you want it super dark red, otherwise just one coat is a little more on the red side.</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it was a little thicker than most of the other China Glaze</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with Zoya, Essie, OPI, Julep, and Sally Hansen Complete Salon Manicure polishes next time.</li>
      <li>It paints on pretty dark.</li>

<li> Chips off very easily its so bad ...</li>
<li> I like dark colors on my nails</li>
<li> After 2 coats it&#x27;s a dark berry-black color with a shine finish.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very deep color and it has a red tint to it, almost like a deep bloody red.</li>
<li> Everyone wear black nails, because its the trending style.</li>
<li> Hardly chips off, and shines with no clear coat needed.</li>
<li> My nails are very weak and frail, they break almost instantly no matter what hardener I use for them.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not your ordinary burgundy color.</li>
<li> but after a base coat and two color coats, this chipped within a few hours.</li>
<li> Another almost bloody color.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Con: The formula for this polish is terrible.</li>

    <li> This color is my favorite nail polish! I wear it constantly. I&#x27;m really glad I decided to buy this product, because I had been looking for nail polish this color everywhere! It&#x27;s a very deep color and it has a red tint to it, almost like a deep bloody red. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Pro: The &amp;#34;Prey Tell&amp;#34; color is a beautiful vampy dark plum and is opaque in 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The formula for this polish is terrible. It took over an hour to dry (even with Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Top Coat) and application was incredibly difficult because the polish was so streaky. Maybe the seller (Beauty Shine) had my bottle on the shelves for too long?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with Zoya, Essie, OPI, Julep, and Sally Hansen Complete Salon Manicure polishes next time. This was my first foray into China Glaze, and I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this color! Great thick coats and buildable.</li>
    <li> This is a super sexy nail polish! You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, &amp; you don&#x27;t have to use more than one coat. Would recommend for girls night out, hot dates, or just to feel sexy! LOOOVEEE!!</li>
    <li> This is a great color for the autumn and winter time.  It paints on pretty dark.</li>
    <li> It is the best nail polish ever ! I like dark colors on my nails and this is just what I was looking for. By painting 2 layers you get a perfect color</li>
    <li> I love this color. Two coats is all you need if you want it super dark red, otherwise just one coat is a little more on the red side. I would recommend it for nights out in the club. It is going to be my go to color for Vegas trips.</li>
    <li> Love this color for winter or fall.  Gorgeous!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. Takes about 3 coats to match the color in the bottle. The only down side is that it chips pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Chips off very easily its so bad ... Nice color though..</li>
    <li> Perfect color for the fall &amp; winter season. It&#x27;s not your ordinary burgundy color. It&#x27;s more of a dark red wine color which makes it look very rich especially when you wear it. What&#x27;s even better is that with just a top coat on my natural nails,the color lasted about a week and half.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful deep wine color. I get lots of complements when I wear it. It goes on smoothly and needs two coats.</li>
    <li> Another almost bloody color.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, a deep whine I would say. Decent staying power. I saw it is perfect for winter. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome color-bright dark!</li>
    <li> Very liquid, uneven tone that turned out to be darker than on the photo.</li>
    <li> The color is just beautiful specially for the fall..</li>
    <li> I love love love the color.</li>
    <li> Beautiful deep red, very sultry and flirty! Application is smooth with no streaking. Only takes two coats! Try the NYC&#x27;s extra shinny top coat to finish the look. Its about 94 cents to $1.75, its cheap but leaves all nail polishes looking fresh and shinny!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. Very true to picture color. Like most nail polish it chips but nothing a top coat can&#x27;t fix!</li>
    <li> I really like this color. It&#x27;s the perfect oxblood shade I was looking for. It&#x27;s a bit streaky the first coat, then levels out opaque with a second coat. Chipping happens after 2 or 3 days, I don&#x27;t use gloves when doing dishes or housework so it might last longer if I did. All in all, I do recommend this color for anyone into deep, dark red.</li>
    <li> Amazing colour, goes with everything that I wear. So EASY to remove, no nail staining. Formulation is AWESOME, as is the brush</li>
    <li> I love Prey Tell, it&#x27;s a gorgeous deep vamp purple-red-burgundy-oxblood color. It looks very dressed up and fancy, but it can be used as accent colors as well. The color looks exactly like it does in the bottle on the nail.</li>
    <li> This China Glaze Prey Tell color is officially my new addiction! After 2 coats it&#x27;s a dark berry-black color with a shine finish. Looks great on my nails, and dark colors make my fingers look longer and more feminine in my opinion. I can&#x27;t wait to wear this in the winter months! I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it was a little thicker than most of the other China Glaze polishes I own so a little harder to brush on smoothly, but it still turned out great on my nails.</li>
    <li> The best nail polish I have ever owned. Long lasting and very good quality. My nails are very weak and frail, they break almost instantly no matter what hardener I use for them. This polish adds just enough protection and hardness that my nails last not just the color. Hardly chips off, and shines with no clear coat needed. I will not be buying all the regular store brands anymore.</li>
    <li> Good color but after a base coat and two color coats, this chipped within a few hours.</li>
    <li> love ,love, love, love it. This the new black. Everyone wear black nails, because its the trending style. I wear this color, because I am one peculiar person. I love the consistency of this color, and love the shine of the final coat of the nail polish.</li>
    <li> This color is gorgeous. Make sure to shake VERY VERY well before applying, or else it can get streaky.</li>
    <li> I love this shade of purple. It goes with many of y bracelets. I can&#x27;t wait to wear this color.</li>
    <li> A little darker that what I wanted but still a great color!</li>
    <li> ALL of their nail polish chips - same day!</li>
