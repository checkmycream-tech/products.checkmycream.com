      <li>Which is surprising since the scent isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
      <li>Love the brand!</li>
      <li>The first thing that struck me about the product was its very pleasant scent, which has the floral notes indicated in the name.  </li>
      <li>I like these caress body washes, but this one, kind of aggravated my allergies.</li>
      <li>One of the things that I notice about body washes is that you smell nice for five minutes</li>
      <li>This creates a nice foam that works well on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This body wash has a really nice almost citrusy scent.</li>
      <li>Smells kind of like a potpourri bathroom air freshener.</li>
      <li>the bottle looks good, it fits nicely in the hand, and is attractive, and is useful to wash your body, lathers well, and works well with a razor for shaving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lathers up great and leaves you feeling clean and silky</li>
      <li>The smells are exotic and make your skin feel amazing.</li>
      <li>Plus it took alot to get a good rich lather.</li>
      <li>Often Gardenia products can be overwhelming (but I love it so the more the better!)</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
      <li>I have tried all three versions and all of them have become my favorite.</li>
      <li>ok if you like body bath soap</li>
      <li>I love body washes.</li>
      <li>Almost smells more like a men&#x27;s body wash than women&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Companies spend fortunes trying to persuade us that there is a meaningful difference in commodity</li>
      <li>but I am still seeking one that has more of a flower smell to it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a top product to me.</li>
      <li>I will be looking for this when I need to purchase some more body wash.</li>
      <li>Nice change from the original and has a nice scent, absorbs quickly and leaves skin emollient and hydrated.</li>
      <li>you are searching for a body wash that is gentle, yet effective on this skin, this is the one to consider!</li>
      <li>This body wash would be adequate for warm weather.</li>
      <li>love to use body wash products and am not disappointed with this one.</li>
      <li>Bottle is easy to grip&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is shaped well and dispenses easily.</li>
      <li>She has used many many different liquid soaps and this is a good</li>
      <li>Caress Body Wash (Emerald Rush) has a nice scent that is noticeable on first use.  </li>
      <li>but this is strong in the bottle but light on the skin.  </li>
      <li>I would use this as both a body wash and lotion because it&#x27;s super absorbent, silky soft and leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
      <li>It leaves you feeling very refreshed, the texture is nice and goes on smoothly, it lathers up well, and it does not irritate the skin.  </li>
      <li>This product has amazed me because it is lightly scented, yet not overpowering.</li>
      <li>so you might enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh clean scent.  </li>
      <li>Overall I find the Caress brand to be one of the best body wash&#x27;s out there, have been using it for years and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>In addition, the bottle is just pretty. :)</li>
      <li>It is light and refreshing and lathers up very well.</li>
      <li>I always feel really clean when I am done.  </li>
      <li>Though I will say I think I would have liked this better in a different scent,</li>
      <li>As a body wash, this does the job of making you feel clean and moisturizing the skin.  </li>
      <li>Scent is clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
      <li>This makes your skin feel so soft, and the scent is nice and light, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell on this product is very pretty and light, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would be nice if the top was flat</li>
      <li>but more surprising was that the scent lingered on my skin for way longer than any other body wash I have used.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really place the Emerald Rush scent as anything in particular, but it&#x27;s pleasant and dissipates quickly.  </li>
      <li>If your skin isn&#x27;t dry, this wash lathers nicely and smells nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>Anyway, its hard to beat Caress for a moisturizing and wonderful smelling body wash.  </li>
      <li>The Tahitian Renewal is much creamier and is my favorite at the moment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I love it and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s flowery and sweet, but with grassy undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is wonderful and the body wash doesn’t dry out my sensitive</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does lather well, and I felt totally clean and fresh after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It really is a shame that this was a bit too drying, because I love the fresh scent and the way it lathers on my loofa.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, the body wash did not bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed this new scent as well.  </li>
      <li>I love this new Caress.</li>
      <li>received a set of these new caress  body washes for my birthday and was excited by the gorgeous color and the name emerald rush but this scent failed to impress me.the product softens skin,has a great lather</li>
      <li>Secondly, I want the kind of body wash where the scent will linger on my skin just like I&#x27;d applied hand lotion</li>
      <li>I gave this four stars because I didn&#x27;t care for the scent as much as the original</li>
      <li>Like most caress products, this had a lovely (if slightly too-strong) scent.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s average to good and everything I would expect of something of this price point.  </li>
      <li>Since I have very dry, itchy and sensitive skin, I was happy to discover that this product seems to improve my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The soap itself lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin.  </li>
      <li>I really like potent body washes as they give me an added sense that I&#x27;m extra clean in the shower.</li>
      <li>Beyond that important element, this body wash is similar to just about any other body wash you might be familiar with, although it does perhaps apply and spread a bit more smoothly than some of its competitors.  </li>
      <li>I just did not care for this Emerald Rush fragrance, firstly.  </li>
      <li>I end up using more wash to get the same amount of soap.  </li>
      <li>It smells more like a hand wash dish detergent than gardenias and white tea to</li>
      <li>This is my second favorite after the Juicy Escape scent.</li>
      <li>I am generally a fan of Caress Body Wash, but this scent isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
      <li>It leaves you clean and soft without any dryness.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is easy to hold and open with wet/soapy</li>
      <li>would certainly purchase this body wash.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item came timely and as advertised</li>
    <li> Quality product well made</li>
    <li> Smells awful!!  I be never used a wash that smelled worse than dish soap before.</li>
    <li> This is a review of &amp;#34;Emerald Rush: Lush Gardenia &amp; White Tea Essence&amp;#34; body wash by Caress.  The first thing that struck me about the product was its very pleasant scent, which has the floral notes indicated in the name.  Beyond that important element, this body wash is similar to just about any other body wash you might be familiar with, although it does perhaps apply and spread a bit more smoothly than some of its competitors.  Anyway, I like it!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this body wash.  It lathers really well and invigorates me while I am in the shower.  The smell is really pleasent and lingers long after you are done with your shower.  I always feel really clean when I am done.  I will be looking for this when I need to purchase some more body wash.</li>
    <li> This body wash would be adequate for warm weather. I used it toward the tail-end of winter when my skin was extremely dry, and it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me. I recommend Dove Winter Care for a great moisture-rich body wash. If your skin isn&#x27;t dry, this wash lathers nicely and smells nice and fresh. I didn&#x27;t feel any sort of icky film on my skin, so that&#x27;s a plus. I would buy it during the summer.</li>
    <li> I have gotten two of these Caress Body Wash products to review. I loved them both but prefered this Emerald Rush over the Aqua Sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell on this product is very pretty and light, not overpowering. Often Gardenia products can be overwhelming (but I love it so the more the better!) but this is strong in the bottle but light on the skin.  The scent did not change like the other product did. It did leave just the lightest hint of fragrance after which is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good quality body wash. It&#x27;s very thick and concentrated, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  It leaves you clean and soft without any dryness.  The bottle is easy to hold and open with wet/soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love it and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Though I find this particular scent to be a step down from the original I still think it works great. Overall I find the Caress brand to be one of the best body wash&#x27;s out there, have been using it for years and can&#x27;t live without it. I would use this as both a body wash and lotion because it&#x27;s super absorbent, silky soft and leaves your skin feeling great. I gave this four stars because I didn&#x27;t care for the scent as much as the original but it&#x27;s still a top product to me. Nice change from the original and has a nice scent, absorbs quickly and leaves skin emollient and hydrated. If you like the scent of gardenia and white tea you&#x27;ll love this. Can be used during or after a shower. Also contains a lot for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great body wash, not too runny and not too think, with a very nice scent.  I really like this entire line of body wash</li>
    <li> The Emerald Rush Caress Body Wash smells heavenly. Just like the Caress soap, the body wash is gentle on my skin and I’ve never had any adverse reactions using it.  Like soap, it&#x27;s critical that the body wash leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean and Caress certainly does just that. The scent is wonderful and the body wash doesn’t dry out my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly purchase this body wash.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, last for a few hours but not all day. Love the brand!</li>
    <li> Fragrance is pleasing, does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I love this new Caress. The smells are exotic and make your skin feel amazing. I have tried all three versions and all of them have become my favorite. It lathers up great and leaves you feeling clean and silky</li>
    <li> We live in a competitive industrial society where everyday products are all satisfactory and perform well. How much difference is there between brands of toothpaste, for example? Companies spend fortunes trying to persuade us that there is a meaningful difference in commodity products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caress body wash was satisfactory. It gets you clean and has a very slight odor that does not persist. The consistency is thick but it pours easily. You have to be careful, though, because the hole is big and it is all too easy to pour out more than you need. For all I know this might be a deliberate strategy to get consumers - that&#x27;s you and me - to use it up fast and buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice if the top was flat so you can leave it upside down when the container is almost empty. It take time for the liquid to trickle down when there is little left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, Will not go out of my way to get it.</li>
    <li> If you like herbal scents, you might like this.  It&#x27;s flowery and sweet, but with grassy undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Lathers great.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Flip top is easy to open and when closed, keeps the water out.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Bottle is easy to grip&lt;br /&gt;4.  Scent is clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Didn&#x27;t irritate or dry my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Nothing, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I prefer some of the other varieties of Caress Body Wash over this one.  The Tahitian Renewal is much creamier and is my favorite at the moment.</li>
    <li> This body wash has a really nice almost citrusy scent. It is light and refreshing and lathers up very well.</li>
    <li> This was a hard review for me to write because I have mixed feelings.  In terms of the quality of the body wash it&#x27;s average to good and everything I would expect of something of this price point.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints on texture, or lathering quality, or the feel on your skin or any of that.  My issue came with the scent.  I just did not care for this Emerald Rush fragrance, firstly.  Secondly, I want the kind of body wash where the scent will linger on my skin just like I&#x27;d applied hand lotion and that&#x27;s not the case here.  I don&#x27;t want to just smell the scent when I&#x27;m in the shower but lose the fragrance as soon as I dry off.  That&#x27;s why I still prefer the stronger Olay body washes.  Though I will say I think I would have liked this better in a different scent, that still wouldn&#x27;t help the longevity issue.</li>
    <li> Caress Body Wash (Emerald Rush) has a nice scent that is noticeable on first use.  It leaves you feeling very refreshed, the texture is nice and goes on smoothly, it lathers up well, and it does not irritate the skin.  While body washes tend to be much alike, this one does each of the things you expect from a body wash well.</li>
    <li> This body wash has a great fragrance. I really like potent body washes as they give me an added sense that I&#x27;m extra clean in the shower. This creates a nice foam that works well on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that you don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it. That can really vary from body wash to body wash. It&#x27;s not a product I necessarily want to have to buy every week and this one looks like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit on the pricier side, but this is a good body wash. If you&#x27;re looking to shift your routine a bit, you should give this a try.</li>
    <li> As a body wash, this does the job of making you feel clean and moisturizing the skin.  However, as a scent, I tried for a month to get used to it and just do not like this scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Gardenia and I like white tea scents but this combo just turned my nose.  It&#x27;s tolerable but not something that I want to smell like.  They just don&#x27;t pleasantly go together for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t choose this scent again but smell is an individual taste so you might enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I like these caress body washes, but this one, kind of aggravated my allergies. Which is surprising since the scent isn&#x27;t very strong. It has a very faint floral scent, but if I didn&#x27;t know it was intended to be Gardenia, I would never guess. Like the other shower gels, it has a pleasing presentation- the bottle looks good, it fits nicely in the hand, and is attractive, and is useful to wash your body, lathers well, and works well with a razor for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found after use, that my existing congestion felt worse though. I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have allergies, you might find this to be a pleasing and inoffensive product. I prefer, personally, a scent that lingers on the skin, and this one didn&#x27;t. Pleasant but not repeatable.</li>
    <li> Why dont they make body washes in bottles with pumps anymore? I want a pump to make it easier to use!!! Anyway, its hard to beat Caress for a moisturizing and wonderful smelling body wash.  This makes your skin feel so soft, and the scent is nice and light, not overpowering. The price is good and the bottle holds a lot. This is a very nice body wash.</li>
    <li> This product has amazed me because it is lightly scented, yet not overpowering. The scent is fresh and clean. Since I have very dry, itchy and sensitive skin, I was happy to discover that this product seems to improve my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are searching for a body wash that is gentle, yet effective on this skin, this is the one to consider! And I say this because if my rough, itchy skin actually improved using this, it is highly recommended by me!</li>
    <li> Too often I find that body washes sold at drug stores do not have the same amount of foaminess of products you buy at Bath and Body Works.  I end up using more wash to get the same amount of soap.  However this caress body wash is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a small amount to my net loofah, and found it made a great amount of soap foam.  Most importantly, the body wash did not bother my sensitive skin.  I am a pale redhead who is allergic to pretty much everything.  I had no irritation, burning, redness, or rash.  The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming, thus causing me to sneeze like other body washes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend this caress body wash.</li>
    <li> ok if you like body bath soap</li>
    <li> This is a great bath product and it smells very nice.  Not overwhelming at all.  This is a repeat purchase waiting to happen.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in the smell of Caress Body Wash, Emerald Rush. It smells more like a hand wash dish detergent than gardenias and white tea to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does lather well, and I felt totally clean and fresh after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 18 ounces in a bottle so it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of allergies and some skin diseases and yet there was no irritation or rash after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it because the price is great but I am still seeking one that has more of a flower smell to it.</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant fragrance and lathers well.  Doesn&#x27;t seem as drying as some body wash does.  Would get this again.</li>
    <li> I usually buy caress daily silk which I love but decided to try this. BIG mistake. This stuff stinks. Smells kind of like a potpourri bathroom air freshener. Not fresh and clean just flowery and artificial. Also I would NOT recommend this for daily use as it made my lady parts sore and itchy. I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to be gone. I&#x27;m switching back to daily silk. It leaves my skin feeling dry and not clean. If I could give it a 0 star rating I would.</li>
    <li> smells really good.  Love the fresh clean scent.  and it doesn&#x27;t leave a build up on the skin either. both my daughter who has sensitive skin and me who is allergic to perfume can use it.</li>
    <li> My wife said that she likes it.  She has used many many different liquid soaps and this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to get her to explain much more, but I think for her it would come down to price.</li>
    <li> Lathers well. The scent is not one of my favorites. Almost smells more like a men&#x27;s body wash than women&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> watch the bottom of the bottles - mine is cracked.. leaked out all over - smells great tho!</li>
    <li> I love body washes. I love the different scents, the different colors, and the different lathers. I am generally a fan of Caress Body Wash, but this scent isn&#x27;t that strong. It is very simple, not strong, and doesn&#x27;t smell like gardenia at all. At least not to me. Plus it took alot to get a good rich lather. It does work good as bubble bath. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this scent again. It just wasn&#x27;t what I expect out of a body wash. Also, it didn&#x27;t seem to be a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So I have used many body washes but normally I like the creamy ones like Oil of Olay as they don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling overly dry.  I tried this one because of the flavor &amp;#34;Emerald Rush&amp;#34;.  I wanted to see how it would smell.  Also I did want to try it to see if it might be different than others.  It smelled delicious (hence the 3 stars) but I wasn&#x27;t wowed.  One of the things that I notice about body washes is that you smell nice for five minutes and then the scent is gone.  I wonder why that is.  But I found out something by accident.  One day, I ran out of body wash while in the shower and so I took my suave shampoo and poured the same amount as I use with body wash.  Hey, I was desperate.  To my amazement, it worked well but more surprising was that the scent lingered on my skin for way longer than any other body wash I have used.  This is not to say that I have continued to use the shampoo as body wash but it does make me wonder what ingredients shampoo has that body washes don&#x27;t.  Any suggestion???</li>
    <li> Review from wife…&lt;br /&gt;I love to use body wash products and am not disappointed with this one. It lathers well and smells wonderful. The bottle is shaped well and dispenses easily. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> It smells really good. It lathers well. This is the third Caress body wash I&#x27;ve tried of late. They all lather well and don&#x27;t dry out my skin so the main factor to consider is the smell. This is my second favorite after the Juicy Escape scent.</li>
    <li> Like most caress products, this had a lovely (if slightly too-strong) scent. Unfortunately, it also dried my skin out significantly compared to my current body wash, from St. Ives. As I live in the desert and summer&#x27;s coming up, I will certainly not be converting.</li>
    <li> I use Caress Body Wash a lot and like it.  It lathers well and a little goes a long way.  It rinses off well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I enjoyed this new scent as well.  It is strong so if you are sensitive to scents you might not like this, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last for long either so I have no problem with it.</li>
    <li> As I suspected, this was just a touch too drying for my skin. I have EXTREMELY dry skin and a skin condition, so I need very moisturizing body wash. It really is a shame that this was a bit too drying, because I love the fresh scent and the way it lathers on my loofa. In addition, the bottle is just pretty. :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really place the Emerald Rush scent as anything in particular, but it&#x27;s pleasant and dissipates quickly.  The soap itself lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin.  Some scented soaps irritate my skin, but this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> received a set of these new caress  body washes for my birthday and was excited by the gorgeous color and the name emerald rush but this scent failed to impress me.the product softens skin,has a great lather but i&#x27;m totally not a fan of the fragrance</li>
    <li> Smells and feel wonderful</li>
