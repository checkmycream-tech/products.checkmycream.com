      <li>BUT if you are very sensitive be warned that it stings.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but I am excited to find it on Amazon and for a lot less than I paid in the store.</li>
      <li>It goes on really smooth and after a few seconds you feel the tingling sensation.</li>
      <li>Wear this with a little bit of lip liner on the edge of your top lip and just the outside third of your both sides of your bottom lip.</li>
      <li>your lips will really plump up, then become very dry, peeling and irritated afterwards.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you are looking for that sexy pouty look, this will definitely do it.  Amazon has represented this product well and I do recommend it.  It was packaged well and came in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday. I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore but I am excited to find it on Amazon and for a lot less than I paid in the store. Wear this with a little bit of lip liner on the edge of your top lip and just the outside third of your both sides of your bottom lip. Then, just blend for a pouty look. I think this plumper makes my lips look at least a third larger. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite ever. Love the tingle feeling it leaves and my lips look plump and full.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a limp plumper addict. I have full-ish lips already but I love the look of bee-stung lips. I&#x27;ve used Dior, Too Faced, and everything else under the sun. This tingles a bit (has a cooling feeling instead of a burning feeling), but I don&#x27;t think it does much plumping. However, the gloss itself is SO SHINY and not sticky (even though I like sticky glosses). I found after I have it on for a while, it will build up and get globby and super gross (hence the four stars. But its only a minor inconvenience). But yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: Plumping? No. Glossy? So shiny! Considering I paid $3... Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer, did not have plumping effect.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Doesn&#x27;t even tingle like it should. Color is nice.</li>
    <li> This product caused blisters on my gums.  Yes its for the lips but if some of the product happen to get into your mouth its pain for a week.  I just purchased this product and from the very first day I tried it I was in pain for a week thereafter.  Brushing my teeth was very painful.    Would not recommned this product to anyone.  I believe I should get a refund.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected so the price really was too good to be true.  I couldn&#x27;t get the gloss to come out of the tube and when it did it was not clear and it was VERY thick!  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used many different lip glosses and lip sticks and this is by far my favorite and not even expensive, great for the money and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend fell in love with the lip plumper and they discontinued it. Was very glad to find old stock</li>
    <li> Pretty gloss, tingling, gives the illusion of a plumping effect...</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure if this would work but I tell ya It truly does I seen a diffrence within minutes of my lips. :)</li>
    <li> This works! BUT if you are very sensitive be warned that it stings.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars but it doesn&#x27;t last long, has a weird smell and burns when you put it on.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it was really plumping, didn&#x27;t notice any plumping and didn&#x27;t have the minty/stinging feel. It is fairly sticky though and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Its ok like the color. But the sensation doesnt last all that long . The color is very light so it goes well if u dont want it to show much</li>
    <li> Sheer, perfect for all skin types. Goes on nicely and has a slight tingle to let you know it&#x27;s subtly plumping. I really like it.</li>
    <li> It obviously doesn&#x27;t work AS WELL as one would hope, but it IS the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve tried so far. It does add a subtle plump to your lips and feels great without burning you. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I feel that the gloss works in my lips but it doesnt work . The color is pretty though. But I dont rrecommend it</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It goes on really smooth and after a few seconds you feel the tingling sensation. It works and makes my lips fuller. The sheer works great over your lipstick as a shiny gloss. I liked it so much i have ordered more colors.</li>
    <li> tingly nice feeling on lips. makes them look larger and its just a sheer nice gloss. goes well over lipstick or under it.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the Madeline plump up lips I ran out of and I love it. It provides sheer gloss and a lite sting, refreshing.</li>
    <li> It has very nice shine, it plumps my lips and makes them very smooth and soft.  The color gives my lips a very natural and sexy look.</li>
    <li> I dont think it plumps very much but it doesnt burn/tingle severely like other lip plumpers do. But it is so smooth like velvet on your lips. Im used to MAC lipglass that is so sticky and makes your lips feel gross once it starts to dry. Not this stuff, its honestly the smoothest, softest, least sticky lip gloss I have ever used. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This plumping lip gloss works pretty good but this shade is a bit orange</li>
    <li> It has a bad taste and initially tingles when applied, but did not plump lips at all! Disappointed with the purchase threw it in the trash after 4-7 times trying! I don&#x27;t recommend !</li>
    <li> Dried my lips out for a week after just one use. Didn&#x27;t even plump my lips at all. Was too thick and greasy. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have not tried this before but i liked the color and it definitely tingled when put on and gave a little plumping effect</li>
    <li> I have used this product before. It comes in nice colors and this one is completely nude shade highlighting your natural lip color. It has a nice tingle to volumize your lips.  The only downside is it does not last long and you have to keep reapplying.  Hence the 4 stars. But overall, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this. You can feel it working and it gives a nice, long lasting shine to your lips without effecting color</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think It plumped my lips at all, and the color was so-so. I would&#x27;nt buy It again, there are cheaper alternatives that would work much better than this one.</li>
    <li> its ok..nothing special and I dont like that the applicator is just the plastic casing that holds it..the color is nice.</li>
    <li> I could see and feel a difference in my lips after a few days of use. However I found out it is strong and if you use too much of it your lips will really plump up, then become very dry, peeling and irritated afterwards. To prevent that from happening, I put on a base of chapstick before applying this plumper and then I add lip color.</li>
