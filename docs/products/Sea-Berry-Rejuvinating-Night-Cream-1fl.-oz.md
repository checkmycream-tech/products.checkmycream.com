### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great stuff!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also very good.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any great difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>Although a great product, I did not notice a difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I do not like the feeling, see nothing good and will not reorder it.</li>
      <li>I started using the Sibu night cream a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;m delighted to say that it seems to be working almost as well as the oil.  </li>
      <li>Love this night cream!</li>
      <li>LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>An amazingly moisturising night cream.</li>
      <li>This moisturizes nicely and has no offensive scent.  </li>
      <li>but I find Argan Oil products as effective or moreso, so I&#x27;ll stick with them.</li>
      <li>I use the seed oil (straight) on my face and that&#x27;s given me my best results.  </li>
      <li>this is a wonderful night cream, completely non greasy, makes your skin feel very soft, wonderful scent,&lt;br /&gt;not overpowering.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so refreshing and</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s much better than the day cream.</li>
      <li>Sibu products are excellent for skin with problems, especially aging skin</li>
      <li>Also, unlike most creams, it does not leave a sheen.  </li>
      <li>I have most of the Sea Buckthorn line</li>
      <li>Since, using these products my skin is smoother, healthier, and more even toned.</li>
      <li>I love this cream</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t enjoyed the process or the consistency.  </li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s certainly not enough to turn me away from this excellent cream.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I also use the lotion and love the product.</li>
      <li>I love most of Sibu products but this stuff is just sitting in my medicine cabinet.  </li>
      <li>I thought that I&#x27;d see more moisture in my skin, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
      <li>Good smell, absorbs fast and I think it&#x27;s made a difference.</li>
      <li>The cream is very light and absorbs easily and quickly into the skin.  </li>
      <li>I use the Sibu Nourishing Moisturizer cream during the day a love it so much and decided to try the night cream!</li>
      <li>Love it as much!</li>
      <li>My skin was getting dry and these two products work awesome to keep it soft and silky!</li>
      <li>It is a great value that compares to other products that are 3x the price!</li>
      <li>Sea Buckthorn is my new absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>Honestly, though, it&#x27;s not worth paying more for.  </li>
      <li>There are lots of natural ingredient, cruelty free, no chemical moisturizers to be easily found.  </li>
      <li>This is a great mosturiser my face never looked better especially in the winter time when my face it&#x27;s so very dry.</li>
      <li>Some night creams can be heavy, but this one is great, I recieved within 7 days of placing order, my face loves it.  </li>
      <li>Cream is old and has a crust on top.</li>
      <li>I have pretty dry/dehydrated skin and was excited when I was recommended this at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>Mostly it smells like oranges, but the fragrance of this product only lasts like a minute and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this product and I will continue to order it whenever I need it.</li>
      <li>Not exactly dry and flaky, skin was smooth but not hydrated like I wanted.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t made much difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I received this item really fast</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>neither is the oil unless you slop on way too much.</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s natural and has a light citrus scent (I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances in products).  </li>
      <li>than any decent moisturing creme.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this night cream.</li>
      <li>Who could imagine such a small jar could deliver the incredible results in such a short time.  </li>
      <li>(By the way, sea buckthorn is the only non-chemical product I&#x27;ve ever found that really helped with age spots!)  </li>
      <li>It feels like old cream.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve seen no difference in my skin so far.  </li>
      <li>Too early for any &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>You can get a nice vitamin packed, antioxidant loaded facial moisturizer at Target for a lot less money--and you don&#x27;t have to hunt it down at health food stores or order on line.  </li>
      <li>The cream is generally faster to apply than the oil.  </li>

<li> The only down side is it has a slight fishy smell to it because of the omega vitamins.  </li>
<li> I do like the other 2 glass bottles with the pumps on them</li>
<li> When I&#x27;m lazy or in a bit of a rush at night, I see myself just grabbing my Alba night cream which is also terrific.</li>
<li> Despite being closed tightly after use, this cream dried out to a solid within a few weeks.  </li>
<li> After applying the cream, my face feels very tight and dry.</li>
<li> Both products fade reddish-toned age spots and make wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
<li> The minor drawback to the cream is that it has a slight odor that&#x27;s not good.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on that one.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t spread well and its almost dried out or something.  </li>
<li> Waste of money.  </li>
<li> Not a strong Fragrance.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t stink or anything, and it&#x27;s very slight, but something I do notice.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how beneficial this is...</li>
<li> NO MORE ORDER night cream.</li>
<li> but this night cream is difficult for me to use.  </li>
<li> Weird.  </li>
<li> I guess I had the wrong concept.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s very poor quality.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;it is very expensive, and does not help my skin, and I do not recommend to buy it</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Despite being closed tightly after use, this cream dried out to a solid within a few weeks.  Can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on a Town &amp; Country Magazine article and an on-line blog review.  I like that it&#x27;s natural and has a light citrus scent (I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances in products).  However, I&#x27;ve seen no difference in my skin so far.  The reason may be that I have only used this one product along with my other brands for cleansing, etc., so I have now purchased the cleanser and eye cream.  Even if I have no improvement in my skin, as long as I don&#x27;t have a reaction and know that this product doesn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients, that may keep me using it regardless.</li>
    <li> The cream is very light and absorbs easily and quickly into the skin.  Also, unlike most creams, it does not leave a sheen.  Would recommend to anyone with any skin type.</li>
    <li> I use sea buckthorn for age spots with the side benefit of smoothing out wrinkles.  I use the seed oil (straight) on my face and that&#x27;s given me my best results.  I started using the Sibu night cream a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;m delighted to say that it seems to be working almost as well as the oil.  The cream is generally faster to apply than the oil.  It&#x27;s not greasy, but neither is the oil unless you slop on way too much. :)  Both products fade reddish-toned age spots and make wrinkles less noticeable.  (By the way, sea buckthorn is the only non-chemical product I&#x27;ve ever found that really helped with age spots!)  The minor drawback to the cream is that it has a slight odor that&#x27;s not good.  It doesn&#x27;t stink or anything, and it&#x27;s very slight, but something I do notice.  The seed oil does not have this odor.  However, it&#x27;s certainly not enough to turn me away from this excellent cream.</li>
    <li> This is a great mosturiser my face never looked better especially in the winter time when my face it&#x27;s so very dry. Also try their serum it&#x27;s also very good.</li>
    <li> Who could imagine such a small jar could deliver the incredible results in such a short time.  My skin looks and feels rejuvenated.I highly recommend this night cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have most of the Sea Buckthorn line and I do not want to be without it. Since, using these products my skin is smoother, healthier, and more even toned. The only down side is it has a slight fishy smell to it because of the omega vitamins.  Mostly it smells like oranges, but the fragrance of this product only lasts like a minute and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Overall, I love this product and I will continue to order it whenever I need it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Melasma on my face since my third pregnancy.  This is the ONLY product that has faded it to almost non-existence.  My husband noticed it as well and he doesn&#x27;t notice anything.</li>
    <li> An amazingly moisturising night cream. I wake up with plump skin that is basically glowing.  Sea Buckthorn is my new absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> Although a great product, I did not notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I thought that I&#x27;d see more moisture in my skin, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  I guess I had the wrong concept.  I just didn&#x27;t like the texture of my skin after using this.  Not exactly dry and flaky, skin was smooth but not hydrated like I wanted.</li>
    <li> I received this item really fast but it&#x27;s very poor quality. Waste of money.  Cream is old and has a crust on top. I ordered other Sibu creams a year ago and they have later expiration date then my \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; cream that I just relieved.  I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Good smell, absorbs fast and I think it&#x27;s made a difference. I also use the lotion and love the product. It goes a long way so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting any.</li>
    <li> I like all of the Sea Buckthorn products but I especially like this one. It hydrates and plumps my skin at night and I also feel a tightness in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cindy B</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful night cream, completely non greasy, makes your skin feel very soft, wonderful scent,&lt;br /&gt;not overpowering. recommend!</li>
    <li> This moisturizes nicely and has no offensive scent.  Honestly, though, it&#x27;s not worth paying more for.

However, as soon as you put it on your face feels stiff, similar to how your skin, if you have dry skin, feels after a shower... I would not recommend this product because of the uncomfortableness of wearing it.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product&lt;br /&gt;it is very expensive, and does not help my skin, and I do not recommend to buy it</li>
    <li> great stuff!! I love this cream it&#x27;s so refreshing and just what it claims to do for you! ! !</li>
    <li> Too early for any &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.  Not a strong Fragrance.</li>
    <li> I always used sibu day cream and sibu oil. This night cream was not what I expected.  It feels like old cream. When I used my face color change to red and etching.  NO MORE ORDER night cream. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Some night creams can be heavy, but this one is great, I recieved within 7 days of placing order, my face loves it.  It is a great value that compares to other products that are 3x the price!</li>

    <li> Sibu products are excellent for skin with problems, especially aging skin</li>
    <li> i like this one. it&#x27;s moisturizing. the smell… not so good… but it&#x27;s much better than the day cream. don&#x27;t waste your money on that one.</li>
