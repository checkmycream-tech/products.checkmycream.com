      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied buying this Razor at Amazon.</li>

      <li>Excellent quality, sharp blade , fades beautifuly cuts flawlessly.</li>
      <li>Great Clippers to use very smooth and accurate!</li>
      <li>Although Andis has a great reputation, This set of clippers do not run or cut smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Great fit, will not move a bit</li>
      <li>light weight, not too noisy, works great, works just like if I had gone to a pro barber shop.</li>
      <li>I purchased these clippers so I could cut my own hair and do my own fades.  </li>
      <li>so I think its safe to say all is good with it.</li>
      <li>thing that would make them better would be if they came with a good carrying case.</li>
      <li>no lines,get a lil warm</li>
      <li>Its saved me tons of money now that I cut my own hair.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with this product, thanks.</li>
      <li>Super durable and great cut.  </li>
      <li>Good product, works just fine.</li>
      <li>After watching a handful of raving reviews off Youtube from professional barbers, it was unanimous that the Andis Fade Masters was the best set of clippers to purchase.</li>
      <li>The motor is powerful and cuts with great precision.  </li>
      <li>so an experienced barber probably won&#x27;t have the issue of the clipper running hot.</li>
      <li>Because when you do 30+ haircuts a day, its always good to have a cool pair of clippers to switch off to every couple of clients.</li>
      <li>Very good Clippers for professional usage.do not get hot when you working your haircut one after another.feels great in the hand.little problem to feet in the guards.</li>
      <li>Has an all chrome look that you won&#x27;t regret until that baby starts sizzling in your hands :)</li>
      <li>The lever on the side for adjusting the taper is awesome especially since it has the notches</li>
      <li>Regardless, I did not have the best experience with the Andis Fade Master and will be trying a different brand moving forward.</li>
      <li>therefore it is best if you start with the blade all the way open until you get the desire blend</li>
      <li>I love it, this unit does it all.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>i love this machine....</li>
      <li>I love the feel and performance.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll be used for sure.</li>
      <li>ok I have seen better quality and better customer service</li>
      <li>you will love them.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>The blade was ok because i kept oiling it while i was using it</li>
      <li>I have used Andis Fade Masters before and love the clipper.</li>
      <li>40 years in the business, 10 sets of clippers, Mostly Oster...  </li>
      <li>I prefer to use my Oster Fast-Feeds (which are lighter) to cut the hair on the top of my head, and I prefer the Andis T-Outliner for balding.  </li>
      <li>I love the wade it fades.</li>
      <li>But I always was glad to get home to use my andis master.</li>
      <li>I would still give it a fair shot because they&#x27;re apparently well received by the most talented barbers on Youtube.</li>
      <li>love it cuts my hair very nicely, I love the ajustabliity and how easy it is to hold on to</li>
      <li>Beautiful blade, thus far.</li>
      <li>Not the single magnet.&lt;br /&gt;These are excellent...</li>
      <li>the plastic gard for the blades didn&#x27;t fit so most belong to another model,  seems the product had been used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This blade is more for advanced barbers but feel free to follow my on instagram @thejoebarber to ask more questions.</li>
      <li>Awesome clippers, cut awesome, and they really do a tight fade every single time.  </li>
      <li>Sturdy and strong.</li>
      <li>Nice clippers but the get hot as hell after 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Dissapointed with my first Andis clipper to be honest.  </li>
      <li>but it is super easy to adjust it to a zero-gap, I love this clipper</li>
      <li>i tried them out and they work just fine</li>
      <li>but the end result was fine .</li>
      <li>great commercial feel and look!!  </li>
      <li>if it wasn&#x27;t for the great customer service amazon has I would totally stop using Amazon...</li>
      <li>I found them to be comfortable to hold (I like the weight to them)</li>
      <li>These clippers run quietly, smoothly and cut well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a HUGE step up from the cheap $20 clippers that are sold at the drug store.</li>
      <li>Great all around for generally all haircuts good power knocks down hair like nothing great for balding also, just be care with setting the blade gets very close eye ball blade from the side with a tilt, use the side screw to adjust the sound</li>
      <li>Great but must start with Andis regular guard first then the fade master as its very precise not for novice hands..</li>
      <li>They advertise this clipper runs cool and quiet but its not that great.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I checked it first.</li>
      <li>They were a birthday gift for my son and he was so excited he cut someone&#x27;s hair the m</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Teeth broke while using the clippers the first week.</li>
    <li> second time buying them and still heats up super quickly and the second time you try to use it starts pulling and making very loud buzzing noise. awful product.</li>
    <li> Gave my a close shave.  Nicked myself really good a couple of times.  I dropped them twice and the teeth broke twice.  Not very durable.</li>
    <li> Tested it and works great as well a great sound to it. Not light, a bit heavy but with great control over it which amazed me.</li>
    <li> They were a birthday gift for my son and he was so excited he cut someone&#x27;s hair the m</li>
    <li> Received this and the blade was broken and there were hair shavings in the blade. No happy</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, who cuts hair. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Good product better for head hair than beard trimming but a good quality to it. Adjustable and fairly versatile though pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected, but item was obviously used. I thought I was purchasing a brand new item...that is what the item was listed as. There was hair on the item and in the box. But in perfect working order!!! Use it all the time!!</li>
    <li> After watching a handful of raving reviews off Youtube from professional barbers, it was unanimous that the Andis Fade Masters was the best set of clippers to purchase. I took the leap of faith and the first delivery was disheartening as the product had a defect and the clippers sounded incredibly harsh. Something was clearly wrong. The motor had a failure and I returned it back to Amazon. They kindly replaced it and now even the new replacement has an issue with it failing to power on after 1 min of use. Maybe I was unlucky and received a bad batch from the factory. Regardless, I did not have the best experience with the Andis Fade Master and will be trying a different brand moving forward. I would still give it a fair shot because they&#x27;re apparently well received by the most talented barbers on Youtube.</li>
    <li> Great! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Super durable and great cut.  I have been using for five years and never sharpened.</li>
    <li> Disregard the two star review if you know Anything about clippers then you know that you must adjust them when they are loud this goes with any clippers. I am a master barber and they work great if you use them correctly. They are mainly used for taking the line out of bald fades.</li>
    <li> This machine is a beast and heavy duty. However my cons is not about the device itself.... Its about the device condition in which i received it. i think mine has been used. This picture was taken right after unboxing it. Also there is this loud clicking noise once u turn it on ... I dunno is it just or everybody else</li>
    <li> Returned this. Problem was that it is too heavy for my taste and it gets hot. I have an extra clipper when in case it gets too hot after doing several haircuts in a row, but this clipper takes a long time to cool off. It is really really hot in my hand after only a few minutes of using it and putting it aside for a few minutes doesn&#x27;t help. Problem with the chrome body of this machine is that it GETS HOT. This isn&#x27;t a problem when you buy another clipper with a plastic casing.</li>
    <li> Great Clippers to use very smooth and accurate!</li>
    <li> Nice clippers but the get hot as hell after 30 minutes. Not a good look at all.</li>
    <li> I see all these reviews, people cutting them self ect ect.&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE PROFESSIONAL CLIPPERS! designed for somebody who knows how to fade to get lines out from a bald fade/straight razor fade.&lt;br /&gt;if you want something that you wont hurt yourself with then get the regular MASTERS not the FADE MASTERS.&lt;br /&gt;the blade on this thing is aggressive and close cutting....the regular masters do not cut as close and are more NOOB friendly.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t rate this clipper if you do not use it for what it was made for PROFESSIONAL/SKILLED  FADES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are great for a skilled hairdresser or barber however hairdresser and barbers would already know this I guess.</li>
    <li> Best Clipper on the market. Still running like new after more than a year of daily use. Sturdy and strong. You can tell you have a quality product in your hands when you hold it. Powerful motor. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have one years ago and thought I&#x27;d try them again after adjusting the blades not bad. They&#x27;ll be used for sure.</li>
    <li> This purchase was a gift. I have not heard any complaints on it so I think its safe to say all is good with it.</li>
    <li> The fade masters work great, the different settings allows me to fade without really having to put a guard on. The only down fall, is that after cutting about two heads the fade masters get hot. So you have to let them cool down a bit.</li>
    <li> really great clippers the speed is awesome and I have customers in and out pretty fast so that&#x27;s why its 5 stars from me</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because I receive a damaged clipper blade and I notified the seller threw amazon 3 times and never received any news the clipper runs ok I have seen better quality and better customer service I regret even buying the product I do not recommend anyone to purchase this product on line in person would be better so this way you see what you buy especially with this product.</li>
    <li> Does everything it says except it does run a bit hot, it got hot while I took a few minutes to tighten them up. Keep a wet tile to keep em cool, between edging with the trimmers. Powerful cuts close, does NOT cut zero, use the trimmes for that, I cut myself a bald taper, this product is worth it!</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Spent good money on them and they git the job done. Smh did have to buy replacement guard due to some hard headed boys breaking some of the forks. Was 23 bucks gone that fast.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers so I could cut my own hair and do my own fades.  I found them to be comfortable to hold (I like the weight to them) and while they do run a little hot after awhile, they don&#x27;t generate enough heat to cause discomfort to me.  These clippers are great for blending.  I prefer to use my Oster Fast-Feeds (which are lighter) to cut the hair on the top of my head, and I prefer the Andis T-Outliner for balding.  Also, contrary to some comments I&#x27;ve read in reviews about this clipper, you CAN use them with guards...as long as you don&#x27;t zero-gap them.  I&#x27;m very happy with this machine.  It&#x27;s a HUGE step up from the cheap $20 clippers that are sold at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;m very impressed with this Razor, when I got it the look of it is impressing. It is a little heavy but hey I am a guy and this is not a lady&#x27;s Razor. I try it that very day and it is like a Barbers so I am not disappointed, remember to oil it often. I&#x27;m very satisfied buying this Razor at Amazon. Enver A.</li>
    <li> So far I like the product. It will take some time getting used to.  There was a little doubt that this was used. I saw a hair on the blade.&lt;br /&gt;If I was solely convinced it was used I would return it and never purchase something like this again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> The product is broken does not work need to return.</li>
    <li> A huge upgrade over the equivalent Wahl clippers, especially with the magnetic guards and the graduated open/close knob. My clippers came with the cover loose, I had to tighten that up. They do run pretty warm, but only after a long time; keeping them clean and lubed should help with that.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend the Fade Master with the purple guards (not included).</li>
    <li> I am absolutly disgusted! This arrived and is USED! The chrome on the clipper is scuffed up and there was a HAIR on it. This was for a birthday present. I am glad I checked it first. Unacceptable! I have to return it, and wait for my money to go back in to my account as well as look for another product elsewhere. What a hassle and huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> this machine when I cut the hair, all the hair get stock and I have to stop my job and opened to cleaned:(</li>
    <li> Its great for bald fading it gets rid of any line when fading to the skin make sure you watch a video how to set the blade also fyi</li>
    <li> This clipper a disappointment,  one tooth on the cutting blades was broken,  with scratches in different places,  fingerprints,  the plastic gard for the blades didn&#x27;t fit so most belong to another model,  seems the product had been used.&lt;br /&gt;I try to contact the maker, as was asked ,on a note inside the package,  but they only have an answering system to leave messages so they can call you black at their convinces,  I sended it,back to Amazon, since I bought it from them.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that Amazon sended the label without any objections and the refund, so, I will keep on buying things from Amazon but , definitely,  not from this brand.&lt;br /&gt; Hector</li>
    <li> I have been able to perform great hair cuts with these clippers! They yield a very professional well cut look.</li>
    <li> This is class A quality equipment.  The motor is very quiet and smooth running.  Great price for product.  I recommend this to anyone  whether starting to cut or seasoned</li>
    <li> love it cuts my hair very nicely, I love the ajustabliity and how easy it is to hold on to</li>
    <li> First off, let me just say that I am not a barber by any means. I cut my own hair and am basing the review of this clipper solely on my personal experience with it. Although it is pricey, Andis is a very good, reliable brand. I have a few different Andis clippers that I use and absolutely love them. The Fade Master is great for those of you that want a quality clipper for keeping your hair short or want a very close cut. The lever on the side for adjusting the taper is awesome especially since it has the notches so you know exactly where to set the lever. The other positive thing about this clipper is that you can fit the Andis magnetic comb attachments. They fit perfectly. The only negative thing I would have to say about this clipper is that it runs hot, very hot with prolonged use. As I mentioned before I&#x27;m not a barber so it does take me a long time to cut my own hair so an experienced barber probably won&#x27;t have the issue of the clipper running hot. Another reviewer suggested having a wet cloth handy to place the clipper in to cool it off when it gets hot. It actually does help cool the unit. In summary, this is a high quality clipper. The build quality is solid and I like that it is all metal. I would highly recommend this clipper and it was definitely worth the money. Don&#x27;t let the price deter you. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> These clippers are great. I used Wahl clippers for years but I&#x27;ll be using Andis for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers, cut awesome, and they really do a tight fade every single time.  Very happy with this product, thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used exclusively Wahl in the past, then I decided to try these out...and they are my favorite clipper so far!  They are the heaviest clippers I&#x27;ve used, they are a little noisy, and they will heat up after prolonged use.  The clipper is not technically advanced in anyway like some of the Wahl&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  However, the construction is solid, the motor is stronger than any I&#x27;ve used so far, and the cuts are precise and consistent.  This day and age I expect clippers to be quieter, smaller, and lighter, but this clipper is a bit &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34;, but it works, bottom-line.  This clipper is built for professionals who cut daily.  I expect this thing to last a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Although Andis has a great reputation, This set of clippers do not run or cut smoothly.  clipper blade intermittently stop causing the stationary blade to pull out hair instead of cutting it. That s*** hurts.  I tried adjusting the motor speed, but didnt work. I plan to send these things back.</li>
    <li> My husband is sooooo picky and loves these clippers. He says he can&#x27;t get a good fade without them. Amazing! What else can I say. He regrets not getting them sooner.</li>
    <li> I love the wade it fades. Not hard to use either.</li>
    <li> Bought these thinkin I was getting the real deal&lt;br /&gt;But one of the teeth is broken off and I just opened&lt;br /&gt;Sending it back</li>
    <li> This is a good machine. But the only problem y that after you used it 20 minutes is get ridiculous hot. And you can&#x27;t holder for long time cause is get hot and hot. I only used one time</li>
    <li> These are used clippers! They arrived scuffed and full of hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this bad boy for quite some time ever since I took the initiative of cutting my own hair.  Its a bad ass clipper with fade adjustment, just the right type of blade for me.  Sleek design and chrome for eye candy, rough blades for my thick brushy hair, it holds up and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is ... if you take long to cut your hair, it will get hot, so give it breaks if you find yourself taking a long time.  Cleaning is very simple as I believe (and hope) it is water sealed tight, I can flush the blades very easily and cleanly.  Its saved me tons of money now that I cut my own hair.  Beautiful blade, thus far.</li>
    <li> Best clippers out there..to fade.. My husband loves these and he cuts his own hair so they do get a little hot.. but with a lil maintenance after w very use keeps them working like new every time.</li>
    <li> First, the product was clearly used when I opened the box.  There was a small clear package for the oil that was opened and obvious fingerprint all over the clipper.  Upon my first and only use, the clippers nicked my head on three different occasions, which upset my wife.  I didn&#x27;t give this review one star because I&#x27;m no professional barber, and the clippers seem to be of good quality.  Not what I expected and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend just started cutting hair and he loves these clippers! GREAT price and they came fast. No complaints here about these clippers!</li>
    <li> Definately not! Blades were not aligned, voltage in malta was not good enough! When contacted the site was told it wasnt suppose to be sold internationally! Andia made just for american market</li>
    <li> Great but must start with Andis regular guard first then the fade master as its very precise not for novice hands..</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Teeth from blades punched holes in flesh in process of cutting hair; bleeding occurred.  Returned to manufacturer for repair.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my daughter who is a hair dresser.  The power switch failed in about a week.  I got a replacement which was a little better--it lasted just over a month.  She was under the impression these were supposed to be better than the cheaper Wahl clippers she is still using after seven years when these fail.</li>
    <li> At first glance this item looks cheap, but as soon as you hold it in your hands your quickly realize that this is the real deal and has quality design and functionality.  The motor is powerful and cuts with great precision.  Just wish that I had purchased the combo with the comb.  I am not rating this a five, because after using it twice, I have don&#x27;t notice a big difference between the different levels when you adjust the blades.  I feel that because this is the &amp;#34;Fademaster&amp;#34; I should have been able to fade my and my son&#x27;s head simply by adjusting the blade level.</li>
    <li> I have used Andis Fade Masters before and love the clipper. However, when I ordered from Amazon I was sent a used clipper with an opened box and scratches all over the product. It was advertised as a new product, not used. I would caution others from ordering this product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers and my son loves them.</li>
    <li> I have had other clippers in the past that I would use for travel. But I always was glad to get home to use my andis master. I&#x27;ve had it for 30+ years and it still works great, but I wanted something to cut a little shorter so I ordered the fade master. Perfect. I love the feel and performance. I can tell already that I&#x27;ll be using this one hopefully for another 30+ years.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this to anyone who are frustrated with the low end commercial clippers. This is a pro clipper that will get the job done.</li>
    <li> love it.Very good Clippers for professional usage.do not get hot when you working your haircut one after another.feels great in the hand.little problem to feet in the guards.</li>
    <li> Dug into my skin numerous time and made me bleed! The top blade (non cutting one) has teeth like needles and goes right in your skin...it hurts a bit. I am not the only one who said that this happens either.</li>
    <li> Cut very smoothly, gets really hot if used very long</li>
    <li> Clippers were supposed to be new; They were used and had broken blades. Paid full price. Had to get my refund.</li>
    <li> This product comes with little bits of hair and small scratches. It also comes a little oiled up. I can only surmise that these are products that have come back and have been sent out \\&quot;as new\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has happened three times. The first time I thought was just a once off, so I returned it and ordered it again. Same thing the second time. Why on earth did I order it a third time? I spoke to a friendly Amazon cust service rep and he suggested that this time I buy one not from a 3rd party vendor but from Amazon. This I did and guess what, number three came with little bits of black hair and small scratches. I&#x27;m keeping it though because I assume it will work, I need it, and I just can&#x27;t go back to UPS once again. If I find that it doesn&#x27;t actually work as well--I don&#x27;t even want to go there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I knew of ANY other recommended fade clipper, I would NOT BUY this product.</li>
    <li> Good product, works just fine.</li>
    <li> They advertise this clipper runs cool and quiet but its not that great.  It runs hot after 20 min and i called customer service to see if this was normal and all they said was it can run hot and if i am not satisfied i can return it for a replacement.  They didnt even seem to have a straight answer or didnt want to talk about it.  I just wanted to know if it was normal to run hot.  The blade was ok because i kept oiling it while i was using it but the body of the clipper became too hot to hold.  The customer service guys said it was normal.  So how do barbers use these clippers when they get hot so quickly?  I know they have a lot of clippers to rotate but do they do so that often?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im still baffled at how quickly the clipper became hot.  Dissapointed with my first Andis clipper to be honest.  Im going to keep it however because it cuts just fine and has decent short fades.</li>
    <li> One of the best cutting hair clippers fast shipment as well. I would totally recommend this to all my friends and barber.</li>
    <li> Like the clippers, but didn&#x27;t like the fact that I had to purchase a blade set after receiving my clippers with a broken blade in the mail.</li>
    <li> i love this machine....excellent fades and any style.... i highly recommend buying with the fade master blade but be aware that a one guard will cut more therefore it is best if you start with the blade all the way open until you get the desire blend</li>
    <li> Great product, but I was under the impression that these are &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34;, when in fact they are used. I ordered them as a gift for my bro. He told me that there was hair and oil on these clippers. I should have read the reviews. Just go to Sallys and pay the full price for a new product.</li>
    <li> clipper broke within months</li>
    <li> i bought this machine because i heard it was professional clippers and they do work pretty well , but the blades came all crooked and since im new to professional clippers , i struggled to assemble them the right way . i spent hours on youtube on how to adjust clipper blades . but the end result was fine . i tried them out and they work just fine</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good clipper for the money. It fits the hand well, has some mass behind it so it is natural feel for a person with larger hands. Does not take very long to heat up to the point if it being uncomfortable. Will probably use my wahl designers to start a fade and finish it with the fade masters. Has an all chrome look that you won&#x27;t regret until that baby starts sizzling in your hands :)&lt;br /&gt;Get the purple magnetic clipper guards with this time. Great fit, will not move a bit</li>
    <li> great commercial feel and look!!  one problem &#x3D; way too loud!</li>
    <li> My husband ordered these clippers due to the fact that he is a barber. However, he purchased the wrong product. Im not a fan on returning items and was considering keeping the clippers and making use of them. When we inspected the clippers several teeth were chipped and look as if the product had been either used and restored or damaged and mailed out. I will most definitely be returning this product especially for the price that was paid.</li>
    <li> Lives up to the name. Best clipper for  bald fades. Only downside- Runs HOT!</li>
    <li> The item was damage when I received it.</li>
    <li> Came on time.work great I love it</li>
    <li> This bad boy cuts CLOSE! in addtion to the t-outliner my fade is TOO perfect.  This addition is a must if you&#x27;re planning on not having your head look like a bowl cut.</li>
    <li> clippers get hot  too early for the cost the coolant system should be more advance and the blade does not illustrate good enough precision in comparison to wahls</li>
    <li> Barber for over a decade.  Won&#x27;t use any other clippers. Period.  I buy a new pair every couple of months. Because when you do 30+ haircuts a day, its always good to have a cool pair of clippers to switch off to every couple of clients. These motors do get hot and there is no need to over work the unit.  Every barber should have a standard of three hanging on their counters.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about receiving used clippers but I thought I&#x27;d still take a chance.  Guess what?  Everything bad I read came true!  I took a long breath before I opened the box and lo and behold...there were scratches on the clippers, a LOT of scratches....there is a black mark like they were dropped, there are about seven teeth missing and wait for it.....someone&#x27;s greasy, nasty HAIR is in my supposedly brand new clippers!  I took a photo out of disbelief. If you look under customer images you will see for yourself.  I know it&#x27;s cliche but I&#x27;m going to say it..if I could give it zero stars I would!!!  Never thought I would actually have to say that one day.  No exchange, thank you.  Sending back for refund.</li>
    <li> Blades are very sharp. I only use them for balding and sometimes for blending. the teeth are very pointy and could cut you even with the clippers off.</li>
    <li> I received my clipper in a reasonable amount of time and put it to use right away. This blade is more for advanced barbers but feel free to follow my on instagram @thejoebarber to ask more questions. Thank you</li>
    <li> If you think you can cut hair you need to get these Fade Masters.Best pair of clippers ive ever owed.besides saving me $80.00 a month now I can cut whenever I feel like.great clippers no lines,get a lil warm but that&#x27;s no problem.got to get the&#x27;&#x27; FADE MASTERS&#x27;&#x27; you will love them.</li>
    <li> light weight, not too noisy, works great, works just like if I had gone to a pro barber shop. d</li>
    <li> These are actually great clippers to own as this was my 2nd pair but upon receiving these ones from amazon I realized that one of the teeth were broken and the housing was scuffed and the box was all tore up as if the was a used product. .and the blade cover was also scratched up on the inside as if it had been used before...I order alot from amazon and was really let down by my last 2 purchase. .I emailed them and they are sending me a replacement sooo lets hope this one is ACTUALLY NEW..if it wasn&#x27;t for the great customer service amazon has I would totally stop using Amazon...TIGHTEN UP AMAZON hundred dollar clippers should not come damaged!</li>
    <li> the blade doesnt move, cmon i thought it was new, false advertisement, if you&#x27;re trying to sell a product make sure its new and working !!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, sharp blade , fades beautifuly cuts flawlessly. Last one lasted 10 years, just need the outliner to complete my set .</li>
    <li> Already it&#x27;s making a loud buzzing noise. Had it for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fade master now</li>
    <li> The fade master is a sturdy unit seems like it will last a lifetime. I love it, this unit does it all.</li>
    <li> U gotta know what you&#x27;re doin when cutting with these clippers, but they are A-1 when it comes to getting the line out on a fade. Great for balding too.  The only reason I have it 4 stars is because,  for these to be brand new clippers,  they did a sorry job of packing and handling this delicate tool. Came with a few scratches,  but did look brand new and they cut like new.</li>
    <li> Somewhat complicated to zero gap. Heavy and super hot. It does the job.</li>
    <li> I had these clippers in my &amp;#34;save for later&amp;#34; cart for over a year, but just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pull the trigger on the purchase. When I finally did, I was so excited to get them home and give myself a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first (and only) cutting experience was a complete and total disaster. I hadn&#x27;t shaved in four or five days so I decided to give my beard a trim first. It handled the sideburns fairly well, but once I moved to the cheeks I found that the guard&#x27;s tips were so fine and pointy that they actually went under my skin and pulled it. I&#x27;m assuming it worked into a follicle bed and snagged. This happened numerous times on both sides of my face. It was so bad, I decide to leave that area for my old clippers and so I tried the Andis on my neck area. That was even worse. The blade literally cut me in three different spots. It was at that time I decided that this set of clippers just wasn&#x27;t the right ones to trim a beard so I moved up to the real reason that I got them - to give myself a &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, on the first side of my head, they worked really well. I had no pulling, snagging or laceration issues whatsoever. Then I moved to the other side and suddenly they, once again, became the clippers from hell. They were barely cutting the hair, leaving long areas and the pulling that was going on was horrid. I thought that maybe they had clogged to I stopped mid clip and proceeded to clean and oil the blade. Unfortunately, that didn&#x27;t work. Ultimately, I had to finish up with my old pair of clippers. I have never really liked them, but they do a much better (and a helluva lot less painful) job than these Andis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying cutting hair even more</li>
    <li> I have to pay shipping for repair, the machine supouse be new but we use one or two times, then very noise and no work.</li>
    <li> Save your doh.&lt;br /&gt;Used masters on eBay all day&lt;br /&gt;Fade master blade too&lt;br /&gt;And you can it get it all used..&lt;br /&gt;but buy a new blade with (w/) some new back screws&lt;br /&gt;[If you like]&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems w/ my fade master since I&#x27;ve owned it, July &#x27;11&lt;br /&gt;Nd I do my own weeekly military fadeeeees.......&lt;br /&gt;So I got irritated w/ my master 4RM getting hot,&lt;br /&gt;(takes some timeeeee to get too that part).&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 2nd pair of masters&lt;br /&gt;w/ a fade master blade around&lt;br /&gt;$45 shipped complete or just a couple bucks more for some of you viewer(s)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All masters have the same body,&lt;br /&gt;when all these blades are interchangeable;&lt;br /&gt;phatmaster,&lt;br /&gt;fademaster,&lt;br /&gt;or your standard triple 000 blade&lt;br /&gt;Of course..I sanitize and clean the used clippper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor fades just got easier w/ the profoil shaver&lt;br /&gt;Especially when you do this on your own!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and always does the job</li>
    <li> I just got it today and tried it on one customer and it work just perfect , it doesnt come zero-gapped but it is super easy to adjust it to a zero-gap, I love this clipper</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY. Clippers arrived used! Smudged with fingerprints all over and hair stuck in the teeth. Disgusting! Seeing as the clippers were needed asap they were sanitized then used and the teeth broke off!! Seriously?! Unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Laura Felix</li>
    <li> Great all around for generally all haircuts good power knocks down hair like nothing great for balding also, just be care with setting the blade gets very close eye ball blade from the side with a tilt, use the side screw to adjust the sound and there you go a perfect all around clipper! Sometimes blade will nick a person with large pores on head so be cautious if you never used a surgical blade!</li>
    <li> It Fades me away. Can&#x27;t wait to use it, and my T-Outliner.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Can&#x27;t wait to use it. But it came exactly as I wanted.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the military and requires weekly haircuts. Doing a skin high fade on anything but the FadeMaster is just difficult. These clippers run quietly, smoothly and cut well. I can get down for the closest cut possible and can fade more easily than ever before. They are a professional quality product, and earn their price back in barbers&#x27; fees within a just a couple months of home haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that would make them better would be if they came with a good carrying case.</li>
    <li> Very good product, works fine, will use again.</li>
    <li> 40 years in the business, 10 sets of clippers, Mostly Oster...  Fade master, along with the Andis 2 magnet comb guides... Not the single magnet.&lt;br /&gt;These are excellent... my only gripe is the sensitive on/off switch, the slightest bump will shut off clipper.</li>
    <li> It caught on fire on my second and third use. Now it makes a loud sound.</li>
    <li> Feels like a real clipper.</li>
