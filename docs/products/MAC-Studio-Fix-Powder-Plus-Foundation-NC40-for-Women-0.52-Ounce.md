    <li> Not a trace of authenticity. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> unfortunately the product is not a real Mac. The color is different from the true NC40 existing store MAC. The smell is not good. Never buy here again.</li>
    <li> This product gave no clear way to determine the shade. When I ordered it I ordered the darkest shown and it still   was too light.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this foundation for many years but no longer live conviently close to a store to buy it and therefore decided to order online.  Based on the reviews I was hesitant at first to order here, but am glad I did.  The studio fix was perfect, identical to what I have purchased in a mac store.  I am now ordering my third one.</li>
    <li> excellent product! I recommend</li>
    <li> This product is not a fake!  It exactly the product I wanted MAC NC40 studio Fix! It saved me a trip to the mall.</li>
    <li> this product made me look so orange ! next time ill definitely go to the actual MAC store. ugh.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she looked like a clown with this color. She had her old MAC NC40. This is product is a fraude. She is right now at MAC and she is furious cause they told her it is a fake. How can Amazon let this product be sold continuously and letting their customers be cheated</li>
    <li> The seller was very punctual and the product was like the description!! This is my favorite brand because is excellent for my skin and Mac care it!</li>
    <li> Love mac make up! So great that this is available online.</li>
    <li> Not the real product.</li>
    <li> The product felt old or something was off. I have been wearing MAC, and this shade specifically, for years. For one, the lid (mirror) and powder parts keep sticking and it&#x27;s difficult to get to the powder, but the sponge compartment flaps open almost too easily. Second, the powder itself has lots of little fibers that my last 10 compacts did not have. The consistency/texture of the powder is off. Arrived quickly though.</li>
    <li> Buenisimooooo...... se los recomiendo a todos los compradores, super puntual y el producto es excelente, tal cual como se describe en la pagina es como te llegara a tu casa,!!</li>
    <li> It gives you natural look!</li>
    <li> wrong color for me. But MAC has good product. This is not truly reprsented</li>
    <li> Mac powders never open up like that and necer come with applicator! if you dont belivev me look up fake mac by juicystar07 on youtube</li>
    <li> Muy bueno!!  el producto llego a tiempo en excelentes condiciones y el empaque justo!! Gracias por el servicio, hasta pronto!</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this product at a reasonable price.  However I was very unhappy when I realized it is counterfeit. I have been using this product for 18 years and I love it.  I hope it stays around for a very long time.  I knew it immediately upon opening it was not authentic by the consistency and the smell as well as the coloring.  I had to reorder it from a more reputable source and I received the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing.  I was very disappointed. I like Amazon and will continue to use the service but more &amp;#34;carefully&amp;#34; in the future.  I hope you will seek out this vendor and do some investigating.</li>
    <li> Not at all the color I had ordered, it&#x27;s all pink instead of sand, which is the color of the real MAC. Where was this produced???</li>
    <li> THis product was a fake pretty sad when i realize it! I&#x27;ve only used it once and that was enough to realize it, I couldn&#x27;t believe it I didn&#x27;t realize this could happen on this site! Never again</li>
    <li> my wife adored these products. Excellent price and arrive on time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> Pretty sure mine was fake....it was extremely light in color and didn&#x27;t really stay on. I ordered a new one directly from the MAC website, and it is completely different.</li>
    <li> The powder has shimmer! and it was a rose color skin tone! NOT REAL MAC!!! DONT BUY!!!!! I bought MAC for years and this is NOT MAC!</li>
    <li> I have been using this make-up type and color for 7 years.  I have always purchased it from MAC directly in the past.  This make-up was labeled with my color but either was not the right color OR they put imposter make-up in MAC packaging OR it is so old it was oxidized or something because when applied it turned my skin a reddish orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I contacted seller to request a return, on 04/12/13.  They have still not even responded to me and it&#x27;s now 04/20/13.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!  You have been warned.</li>
