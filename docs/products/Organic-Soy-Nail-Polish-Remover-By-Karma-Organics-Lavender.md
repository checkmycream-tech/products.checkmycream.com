      <li>Super impressed!!!!</li>
      <li>The best part about it is how quickly and effortlessly it takes off the nailpolish</li>
      <li>Ok so here it is - I was nervous about purchasing this product even after reading great reviews about it.</li>
      <li>I love that there&#x27;s an option that doesn&#x27;t make you want to pass out from the fumes!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not hurting my nails anymore with acetone!</li>
      <li>I purchased this one today from another retailer, and i love it!</li>
      <li>Too cute!  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Your hands are moisturized by the oils and smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>amazing lavender scent.  </li>
      <li>The smell is actually really nice.</li>
      <li>My nails feel nice and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It smells nice - none of that nose-wrinkling acetone smell.</li>
      <li>I loathe the smell of nail polish remover, acetone and non acetone, so it makes painting my own nails (which I prefer to do myself over a salon)</li>
      <li>Anyway, I had been meaning to try a biodegradable, yet effective remover.</li>
      <li>I got this product because of the many good reviews I saw.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and leaves your cuticles softer.</li>
      <li>For formaldehyde free nail polish to accompany this fabulous safe remover, the Karma and No Miss Nail polishes are both incredible too, the No Miss lasts even longer than OPI or Essie, both of which I used to use exclusively and now I&#x27;m so happy that I can get even better, healthier results.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I paint my nails more often now since I don&#x27;t dread the removal  process.</li>
      <li>This is the best one so far.</li>
      <li>Awesome product- great value for the price, comes in an awesome glass bottle, and works better than other natural nail polish removers that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>No bad odor, the lavender smell is not too strong, which is great.  </li>
      <li>Excellent at removing nail polish and does not dry out my nails the way that even non-acetone removers do!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>, the price is perfect for it since, you are getting a organic/natural product that will last for ages.</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t like the scent of lavender, it&#x27;s not that offensive and smells waaaaay better than even the &amp;#34;non-acetone&amp;#34; removes.  </li>
      <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
      <li>I dropped a bottle of polish in the bathroom and the top broke off, and the bottle ricocheted out of the bathroom and all over the hardwood floors.</li>
      <li>&amp; I was able to get ALL the nail polish off</li>
      <li>Love the oils in it that help condition your nails.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim and it really is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>The smell is much better than acetone as well.</li>
      <li>am raving about it to everyone - I love not feeling poisoned and knowing that nothing was hurt in the production.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this costs much more compared to aceton-based removers, it has the value.</li>
      <li>Our nails have never been healthier and we have even been getting more playful with polish.  </li>
      <li>and we are all in love with this nail polish remover.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I purchased the non scented bottle and it&#x27;s lovely.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m telling you this stuff works faster, easier, and better than acetone-types, and it moisturizes rather than drying the nails.</li>
      <li>I love this remover and will be using this from now on.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the colors</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that this stuff really works.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying a higher price because it smells awesome, and works really well.</li>
      <li>This stuff however smells like a delightful aromatherapy treatment, takes the nailpolish off with little product usage, and leaves my nails feeling healthier and more mousterized!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to completely spoil my health to create something beautiful.</li>
      <li>Overall, if you&#x27;re about doing your part for the environment, but also want an effective substitute, this remover is great for you.</li>
      <li>When I opened the bottle up for the first time, I didn&#x27;t really expect the hype to be true, but I was very pleasantly surprised--it just smelled like lavender.</li>
      <li>I like that this is more environmentally friendly but the cap does not stay on well and has leaked.  </li>
      <li>Was hesitant on how easy it removes nail polish</li>
      <li>Then I can easily wiggle out from the foil wrap;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It erases caviar, crackles easily.</li>
      <li>but it is still a strong chemical.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong as chemical remover.</li>
      <li>Nourishes nails and skin around a nail, nails stay strong, don&#x27;t flake or brake.</li>
      <li>Just rinse it off before putting new nail polish on and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
      <li>It removes enamel quickly, and it seems to hydrate my nails too instead of drying them out!</li>
      <li>I did not think a natural product would work better than most man-made chemical product when it comes to removing nail polish, but this does!  </li>
      <li>Another huge plus?</li>
      <li>The best thing about it is that it is natural, so no harsh chemical smells.</li>
      <li>It takes a lil more elbow grease, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>It smells fabulous</li>
      <li>When I bought this, I bought it solely for the fact that it was acetone free and non-toxic</li>
      <li>It removes the polish more cleanly, it actually smells GOOD instead of making you want to hold your breath.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product - it smelled so good, a little part of me wanted to sit there and sniff it for hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product smells great. It works as advertised and it does not harm the children/people or environment (as far as I know).</li>
    <li> Worked great on my non-toxic polish - didn&#x27;t have to work too hard like others have said and no harsh smells either.  Haven&#x27;t tried on regular polish but this is certainly worth it&#x27;s money.  The bottle is small, but you really only do need a small amount so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I did not think a natural product would work better than most man-made chemical product when it comes to removing nail polish, but this does!  I paint my nails often (I have found that it is the only deterrent from biting my own nails) so I am very familiar with how long it usually took to removal polish, and I swear this works faster, and it smells like lavender, and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  I love this stuff.  Great gift for a female in your life, a little basket with organic nail care products.  :)</li>
    <li> Amazed at how well this removes \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; nail polish....leaves a bit of an oily residue which I actually like.  Appears to be moisturizing the nail as it cleans....amazing lavender scent.  Tossing all my oil \\&quot;remover\\&quot; out today!</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover has no harsh smell whatsoever.  It actually smells quite pleasant, similar to a lavender hand soap I have.  It works just as well as acetone-based polish removers, taking off a thick coating of nail polish (four coats) with just a few passes of the cotton ball.</li>
    <li> I bought this after taking a house-wide &#x27;cruelty-free pledge&#x27; and received it last week.&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea how it was going to work, but it was beautiful! I used it on dark, mossy green Revlon Everlast nail polish and it removed the stuff after only a rub or two. It left no stain, no nasty scent (it actually smells quite pleasant, like lavender) and only a slight oily residue that came off with hand soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;Because it was so efficient, I only had to use a little bit on a cotton ball making it actually quite economical, in spite of the somewhat off-putting initial price!&lt;br /&gt;I am raving about it to everyone - I love not feeling poisoned and knowing that nothing was hurt in the production.</li>
    <li> Ever since 8th grade science I had learned about how acetone can break down substances (instantly or gradually). To think that so many of us were ruining our nails with acetone-laden removers is quite unsettling. Anyway, I had been meaning to try a biodegradable, yet effective remover. I had gotten one by CVS&#x27;s private label, but it lathers as it removes the polish, feels kind of sticky afterwards, and wouldn&#x27;t even remove all of the polish! Gross! I purchased this one today from another retailer, and i love it! It removes enamel quickly, and it seems to hydrate my nails too instead of drying them out! Once I&#x27;ve removed all of the enamel, my nails and fingertips seem to have an oily residue, but it&#x27;s not gross. I just wash my hands after. Overall, if you&#x27;re about doing your part for the environment, but also want an effective substitute, this remover is great for you.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product. It removes nail polish pretty quickly... even toenail polish that was a month old (don&#x27;t judge me) came off in a jiffy. It was really gentle on my finger skin, and after rinsing off the slightly oily residue, the next coats of base coat/nail polish/top coat went on smoothly and without a glitch. Very pleased with this product - it smelled so good, a little part of me wanted to sit there and sniff it for hours. When has nail polish remover ever made you want to do that? BONUS! Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is pricey compared to the normal reeking $2 jugs of nail polish remover from the drugstore, but it&#x27;s so worth it. It comes in a nice brown glass bottle rather than plastic, with an narrow neck to help prevent spills when you&#x27;re pouring it on a cotton ball. When I opened the bottle up for the first time, I didn&#x27;t really expect the hype to be true, but I was very pleasantly surprised--it just smelled like lavender. No harsh chemical smell at all. It worked just fine on the creme finish polish I had on, dissolving it quickly and cleanly--I haven&#x27;t tried it on any glitter bomb-type polishes yet, though. One odd thing about it is that it has a bit of an oily feel to it, unlike normal remover, which feels quite dry and clean on your skin once it&#x27;s evaporated. You may like this since it seems more moisturizing, but it feels a bit greasy/unpleasant to me compared to normal nail polish remover. That&#x27;s a minor complaint, though, and I&#x27;d highly recommend this product overall.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It does the job and doesn&#x27;t destroy my nails!</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover is excellent. It cuts through any polish (I&#x27;ve tested several colors, but no glitter polishes as of yet) and it perfectly cleans it off the nail, nail bed, cuticle, and skin (for pesky red tones). I&#x27;ve been telling the world about this nail polish remover! The best thing about it is that it is natural, so no harsh chemical smells. The lavender scent is harmonious and since it is made with oils it truly moisturizes the nail areas.     I will never purchase acetone remover ever again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Takes my red polish right off without toxins.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my nails.</li>
    <li> I like that this is more environmentally friendly but the cap does not stay on well and has leaked.  Wish they would revise packaging.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how great this nail polish remover is.  I no longer wanted to use the acetone ones (the cost about $3) and did not mind paying 4 times as much for something was was good for me.  The best part about it is how quickly and effortlessly it takes off the nailpolish (it feels a little oily) and with just very little on a cotton ball, it took nail polish off of my 5 fingers.  No bad odor, the lavender smell is not too strong, which is great.  I will tell all my friends about, because not only is it fast but it is better for you too.</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover is excellent.  When I bought this, I bought it solely for the fact that it was acetone free and non-toxic (I put my hands through enough as it is!).  Once I actually tried it out for myself, I was not expecting the nail polish to actually come off as easily as it did, it takes a bit more swipes of the cotton ball than regular acetone, but it takes it completely off and hydrates the nail instead of drying it out! Another huge plus? I don&#x27;t have to open a window just to take off my nail polish!  It smells just heavenly.  This is an amazing product and worth the extra money, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective remover and far more healthy than any alcohol, chemical based one, and I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a review for this stuff for weeks, but I absolutely had to after tonight, because this stuff really saved my ass. I dropped a bottle of polish in the bathroom and the top broke off, and the bottle ricocheted out of the bathroom and all over the hardwood floors. Eeep! I scrambled and started wiping it up with paper towels, but there was still so much left, smeared all over. Crap. If you have ever spilled polish or regular polish remover on floors, you know that acetone will ruin the finish. With doomsday thoughts of having to get the floors refinished racing through my mind, I looked at my bottle of organic soy nail polish remover and began to hope. I tested a spot in the corner of the room and waited 15 minutes. It didn&#x27;t look any different, didn&#x27;t feel any different........LO AND BEHOLD, A MIRACLE ELIXIR THAT BANISHES NAIL POLISH WITHOUT BESMIRCHING THE HARDWOOD FLOORS UNDERNEATH!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesus Christ, what a relief. And I got it all cleaned up before my roommates got home :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And floor-saving miracles aside, this stuff is really just better. It removes the polish more cleanly, it actually smells GOOD instead of making you want to hold your breath. If it cost twice as much, I would still buy it. I&#x27;m never going back to acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use it with cotton balls, and this actually makes a huge difference. It&#x27;s much easier than with paper towels, kleenex, or toilet paper. Spend the $1.50 at the drug store to get a big bag of cotton balls, they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
    <li> I loathe the smell of nail polish remover, acetone and non acetone, so it makes painting my own nails (which I prefer to do myself over a salon) a dreaded thing because of the smell!  Nail polish stinks too, but not as bad as the chemical headache causing odor of remover.  I purchased the non scented bottle and it&#x27;s lovely.  Its an oil so only a little amount is needed and it cuts through the polish, removes it, and leaves my nails moisturized.  It comes in a pretty glass bottle too (package junkie here). It would have received all stars, but its pricey...why is it so pricey btw?</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Was hesitant on how easy it removes nail polish but after I tried it once - won&#x27;t go back to a regular nail polish removers. Nourishes nails and skin around a nail, nails stay strong, don&#x27;t flake or brake. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I recently got myself into nail art and soon realized I needed to find something other than acetone based remover so my nails won&#x27;t get totally ruined. I read everyone&#x27;s review and it was so very helpful in finding this product. I am very happy with the way it does its job and relieved to know I don&#x27;t have to completely spoil my health to create something beautiful. It does not dry nor sting your nail and surrounding skin and its scent is just lavender, so pleasant you wouldn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that sort of bugged me was that the product description on Amazon was \\&quot;Organic Soy Nail Polish Remover\\&quot; and the company who made this was \\&quot;Karma Organics\\&quot; while the product I received had none of \\&quot;organic\\&quot; title. The ingredients weren&#x27;t organically derived either. Also their company name was \\&quot;Karma Naturals\\&quot; on the product label. I&#x27;m confused by this. It is advertised as \\&quot;organic\\&quot; product while it does not state so on their actual product. It could be misleading to people who are seriously thinking to get \\&quot;organic\\&quot; nail polish remover. I have uploaded a picture of the actual product I received, note on its label.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best nail remover I have used so far. No harsh chemical smell or residue after used. It cleans the nail polishes very well, and does not leave the nails dry. Must have!!!</li>
    <li> It has a mild lavender odor so it is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;it removes the nail polish as conventional removers.&lt;br /&gt;It has soy oil so it notices when I apply, but I like it, the oil protects my cuticules from drying.&lt;br /&gt;They claim to be organic,100% biodegradable, non toxic and non carcinogenic.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Propylene Carbonate, Soybean oil methyl exter, tocopheryl acetate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiene un olor suave a lavanda.&lt;br /&gt;Remueve el esmalte igual que cualquier removedor convencional.&lt;br /&gt;Su base es aceite de soya y me gusta porque ayuda a no resecar la cut&amp;iacute;cula.&lt;br /&gt;Sus premisas son: org&amp;aacute;nico, 100% biodegradable, no es t&amp;oacute;xico ni carcin&amp;oacute;geno.</li>
    <li> It removes nail polish at least as well as the drug store polish removers, and it isn&#x27;t toxic.  It smells nice and leaves your cuticles softer.</li>
    <li> I hated the chemical smell of acetone polish remover and wanted something more natural, then I came across Karma Organics.  I decided to give it a try after watching some youtube videos demo-ing the product.  It takes a bit longer to get off the polish than with traditional removers, but it does work.  I usually dab some on a cotton ball then do a once over on each nail, let it sit for a sec to soak in and then start rubbing, the polish will then come right off.  Your hands are moisturized by the oils and smells amazing.  I love this remover and will be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little messier than I remember &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; polish remover to be but it works really well. It smells nice - none of that nose-wrinkling acetone smell.</li>
    <li> U have to use a lot of it to remove the polish. Considering the price for a bottle, not worth.</li>
    <li> After all those years of products that smell like crap harmful chemicals and irritation to my sensitive nose this item really worked and was so gentle to my skin. I was really skeptical if this would do it. After wrapping my gel nails in foil paper with this for 10 mins even the gel came off. Very impressed. This is my life long nail polish remover</li>
    <li> I used different kinds of &amp;#34;Organic non toxic&amp;#34; nail polish remover until I find this one. This is the best one so far. Three special facts about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Erases well. It erases caviar, crackles easily. You know these require multiple layer of nail polish. No problem! It does not take forever to erase it. As to the caviar, I pour this polish on a cotton ball, place on my fingers, wrap it with foil and wait for five minutes. Then I can easily wiggle out from the foil wrap;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It does not dries your nail.  This is soy oil based product. It does not evaporate like aceton-based removers. In other words, you do not need to keep pouring and rubbing your nails; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It has no stinky smell. Lavender and herb smell definitely sooth your nose and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this costs much more compared to aceton-based removers, it has the value. You know, our nails and hands deserve some good stuff!</li>
    <li> I love that there&#x27;s an option that doesn&#x27;t make you want to pass out from the fumes!  This works well, doesn&#x27;t sting on hang nails (much) and smells decent, love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great organic nail polish remover.  I bought this on a whim and it really is my favorite.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my nails out or sting.  Take polish off fast!</li>
    <li> I like this product since it doesn&#x27;t have acetone, so it doesn&#x27;t dry my nails out. It also doesn&#x27;t have a harsh chemical smell. However, I do have to scrub awhile to remove brighter colors. I end up using cotton balls and Q-tips to get all old polish off.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing.  Love the oils in it that help condition your nails.  I highly recommend for a more natural nail product.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. It took off three coats of nail polish from the salon.  You have to use a bit of friction (rub it well with the cotton pad or ball) but there was no bad smell and my skin wasn&#x27;t irritated at all. Regular nail polish remover is brutal on my skin.  The smell is actually really nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself during pregnancy because I didn&#x27;t want to put chemical on my skin, it worked very well with Karma polish.</li>
    <li> Because this is oil based instead of acetone, it does take a bit of scrubbing to really get the nail polish off your nails.  That&#x27;s really my only gripe about this remover because overall, it&#x27;s so much better for my nails and cuticles.  My nails have stopped splitting/flaking completely and my cuticles are in much better shape, even in the winter.  The bottle is small, but a little goes a very long way.  It even works well on glitters, sand and dark colors (which is 90% of what I use).</li>
    <li> I notice that after my nail, cuticle and skin doesn&#x27;t dry up when I use this remover. I don&#x27;t think it is as harsh as your acetone remover. In addition, there is no strong smell and it removes nail polish very easily (even red nail polish that sometimes stays at the edges of your nail!). Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it works better than acetone. I used to need a few saturated cotton balls to remove the nail polish, but with this one, I only needed one cotton ball, which removed all the nail polish from my fingernails. I highly recommend this non-toxic nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish remover ever! Like another user said, you can easily  get off all your polish with one cotton ball- at times, I&#x27;ve even used half. Since I  use glitter polish regularly, there&#x27;s a little scrub action that I need to use at times  with some of the bigger glitter chunks (my go to glitter is one with several sizes  of flecks, from teeny to BIG), but it&#x27;s not a problem- especially since this remover  does not destroy and dry out my nails the way that acetone does.  I can honestly say that I paint my nails more often now since I don&#x27;t dread the removal  process. This one bottle will last me a long time, and I appreciate its biodegradable  qualities so I can feel a little better knowing that I&#x27;m not destroying my nails and the  earth at the same time...  One technique I do is quickly wet/dab all nails to let the remover start to work its action,  then go back and work each nail individually. Glitter is NOT a huge problem at all, so  know that this remover does tough action just as much as an acetone remover, only  it smells way good, doesn&#x27;t sting any little cuts you might have around your cuticles,  doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails, and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton- you will be surprised at how  far a little can go!</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to me that in order to keep my family away from chemicals and protect the earth I end up spending MUCH more for products that work MUCH less (or sometimes not at all). Enter Karma Organics Soy Nail Polish Remover, I ordered it because of the other good reviews, but in my heart I was certain that it would not get rid of my fuschia nail polish, and IT DID! Not only did it not have any chemical smell, but it took just exactly the same amount of effort to get off the nail polish with this product, as it does with the extremely strong stuff I got from Ulta. I am over the moon!</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this item thanks to a review on Jezebel.com. I don&#x27;t mind paying a higher price because it smells awesome, and works really well. I will never buy the smelly stuff again.</li>
    <li> I can count on one hand the number of reviews I have ever written, but I am so impressed with this product that I had to do it. This nail polish remover really works and is completely non-toxic, it&#x27;s amazing! Because it&#x27;s oil based it leaves your hand and nails feeling soft and no bad smell. For formaldehyde free nail polish to accompany this fabulous safe remover, the Karma and No Miss Nail polishes are both incredible too, the No Miss lasts even longer than OPI or Essie, both of which I used to use exclusively and now I&#x27;m so happy that I can get even better, healthier results.</li>
    <li> Careful! This stuff can fool ya. It smells like Lavendar oil...but is as powerful as any other polish remover...I &#x27;ll buy it again because it does not have a chemical smell....but it is still a strong chemical. It works as well as any other polish remover.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I mean, by far the best n.p. remover I&#x27;ve ever used! I would not bother to write a review but I&#x27;m telling you this stuff works faster, easier, and better than acetone-types, and it moisturizes rather than drying the nails. At first I thought it was a bit expensive, but I would now pay double for it, knowing how superior it is.</li>
    <li> I got this product because of the many good reviews I saw. However, once I purchased this nail polish remover I was very disappointed in the product, and the smell is awful and very strong.</li>
    <li> So for one I normally hate the smell of normal nail polish removers and the ones that worked the best were always so damaging to my nails.  This stuff however smells like a delightful aromatherapy treatment, takes the nailpolish off with little product usage, and leaves my nails feeling healthier and more mousterized! Ar first I was worried cause its pricey, but I am so glad I got it, and since a little goes a long way it will last a while. I have tried it with glitter polish even and it worked. One thing to know is that if you have a more resisten nail polish put the remover on a cotton swab first press it over each nail and then go back to them and the product with have broken it down more by then where it will start to come off fairly easily.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was very skeptical of this but had to try an alternative to the usual awful stinky chemical filled polish removers.  I&#x27;m happy to report that this stuff really works. It has a much lighter smell than other removers and works just as well. I&#x27;m serious!</li>
    <li> This product removes several layers of polish  with one application.  Has a pleasant fragrance and doesn&#x27;t leave nails dried out.  Since it contains no alcohol or acetone, the 4 oz. bottle should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover works fast and doesn&#x27;t leave nails dry.  I highly recommend this product to individuals that do not want to use nail polish removers with acetone.  It is great!!!</li>
    <li> It did remove the polish from my fingernails as promised.  It did not dry my nails out.  I will order again,  The vendor sent the product quickly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a safe &amp; natural polish remover to work so well.  This is a great product.  My 6 year old &amp; I thank you!</li>
    <li> Ok so here it is - I was nervous about purchasing this product even after reading great reviews about it. Here&#x27;s mine: I love this product, it works just like nail polish remover you buy from the store only better. The sent is lovely, the texture is a little oily but I like because it moisturizes the cuticles and last and most important it REMOVES the polish. I noticed it took only 1 cotton ball to remove polish off my five finger nails verses 3 - 4 cotton balls with regular nail polish remover - that to me is a plus. Heads up if you have glitter nail polish it takes a bit longer but still does the job - don&#x27;t get discouraged! Overall it truly is amazing and safe for you &amp; your nails. I don&#x27;t regret &amp; well worth the $. My next purchase will be the polish remover in tea tree sent, cant wait to get that one. Enjoy ladies!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this product since I was pregnant with my daughter - she&#x27;s a year old now, but I was always hesitant because of how much it cost in comparison to normal Acetone. I have to say this stuff is amazing, I will never use regular nail polish remover again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no harsh acetone smell as the product says, instead you get a nice light lavender smell. I had some old nail polish on my toes - probably 2-3 week old polish, so I used one cotton ball flipping the bottle over just once to get the oil on it &amp; I was able to get ALL the nail polish off almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that you have to rub the cotton ball a bit more than you would with regular nail polish remover but not much more. Also, as some users pointed out it is slightly greasy, but what do you expect when the product is oil based? I don&#x27;t mind the oils because I know it&#x27;s nourishing my nails. Just rinse it off before putting new nail polish on and you&#x27;ll be good to go. I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you have a little girl because you wont have to worry about ruining their young nails or causing them to get \\&quot;high\\&quot; off the acetone fumes.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t like the scent of lavender, it&#x27;s not that offensive and smells waaaaay better than even the &amp;#34;non-acetone&amp;#34; removes.  Works just as well without drying my skin out.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as strong as chemical remover. It takes a lil more elbow grease, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> My SIL purchased this for me as a Christmas gift. I have been using acetone to remove my polish for a while, and I was convinced that nothing could work as well. However, my nails were peeling and brittle, and my cuticles were a mess. Enter SIL and her genius gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AMAZING! I fully admit that I didn&#x27;t think it would work. An all-natural oil removing my glitter polish? Yeah right. I poured a very small amount onto a cotton pad and it removed every trace of color, all while moisturizing my nails and cuticles. Instead of my fingers feeling dry and reeking of acetone, they actually felt nourished, with a soft lavender scent to boot! Plus, the oil didn&#x27;t destroy the cotton pad, and I was able to clean all ten fingernails with just that one small amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am cheap, and I am lazy. This stuff is worth the cost and the wait to have it shipped.</li>
    <li> I will never have to buy another nail polish remover.  Four women/girls in this household who all do their nails and we are all in love with this nail polish remover.  It does not have any harmful chemicals.  It has no harsh odor.  It works like a dream taking all kinds of polish off.  And because it is oil based, it always leaves our nails and hands feeling great instead of dry like other polish removers.  Our nails have never been healthier and we have even been getting more playful with polish.  Last week my daughter had watermelon nails and everyone loved them.  Too cute!  Once they were chipped she went straight for this remover and like a dream it removed all of the coats (base, red, green tips, white separator line, black seeds).  The only drawback I can see is that (because it is oil based) it will occasionally leave our fingers a little oily.  We use gentle baby wipes to remove the oils before putting on fresh polish so it does not detract from the experience and I would not even remove a star from the review for this.  Way too much positive for the negative to be of any significance to us personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are wondering, here is the ingredient list and other bottle information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karma Naturals&lt;br /&gt;Nail Polish Remover with Soybean Oil &amp; Lavender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Carbonate, Soybean oil methyl exter, tocopheryl acetate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;100% Soy Based&lt;br /&gt;Non Toxic&lt;br /&gt;Non Carcinogenic&lt;br /&gt;Derived from Farm Crops (supporting American Farmers)&lt;br /&gt;Packaged in 100% Recyclable Glass Bottles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you love it as much as we have!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased 6 new nail polishes and the unscented nail polish remover.  I absolutely love the colors and I buy organic to avoid chemicals and preservatives.  These colors are great!! I always receive compliments on them.  The nail polish remover takes a bit longer to remove all the nail polish, but it does not contain that nasty acetone.  When the polish is off, your nails look so much healthier and there is no acetone odor.  I have been ordering these nail polishes for several years now and will continue to purchase them.  I highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing remover, I always used to use cheaper nail polish removers and the smell would give everyone around me a headache. But, this subtle scent of Lavender is lovely and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to remove the polish and safe my nails. I have bought one last April and it has been almost a year since, I bought my second one. So, it will last you a really long time, the price is perfect for it since, you are getting a organic/natural product that will last for ages.</li>
    <li> Obviously this product is oil-based, and that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it. There&#x27;s a weird feeling to it, but it definitely works. I bought it based on the raving reviews and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this purchase. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not hurting my nails anymore with acetone!</li>
    <li> This product saved my nails. After recognizing the damage I&#x27;ve done using acetone all these years, I decided to set out on a quest to replace it with something less toxic and found this. Not only does it make my nails look hydrated and healthy, it also removes my polish with ease. Since it isn&#x27;t alcohol based, it does not dry out and lasts a very very long time for its small size. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and would not trade it for anything else. Highly recommend to any frequent nail painter like myself.</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover works just as good as any other &#x27;conventional&#x27; polish remove that I&#x27;ve ever used. And it smells really good!  The only down side is that it is slightly oily, so you have to wash your hands really, really good after use if you plan to put on another application of polish.  But this is a small price to pay for something that is so much healthier to use!</li>
    <li> I am pregnant and was looking for a more natural polish remover. There are far to many chemicals in non acetone and acetone removers. I didnt want to inhale all of these chemicals, so I took a chance on this product and WOW! It&#x27;s AWESOME! It smells fabulous the smell is faint and didnt bother me. 1 cotton swab took the polish off of both hands. It can definitely get a bit oily but it conditioned my nails and cuticles they looked better after using this product. I will buy more ASAP!!!! Super impressed!!!! Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> I salute any company that comes up with a half way decent product that is free of chemicals --colors--parabens- and strong preservatives.  This works, you just have to work a little harder at it.  Not instant gratification like the chemical ones--but you will save your nails and prevent them from cracking and drying like the acetones do.</li>
    <li> So much nicer on my nails than the traditional polish remover.  Had I known this existed before now, it would have been my go-to.  A little goes a long way and my nails/finger pads aren&#x27;t dry when I&#x27;m finished.  No strange smells and just as effective if not more so than the icky chemical stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent at removing nail polish and does not dry out my nails the way that even non-acetone removers do!  I have used acetone and non-acetone for years and have found my nails increasingly drier as a result.  Of course, my nails may be drying out due to age, but I have used this product only 4 times so far and my nails look much better. The smell is much better than acetone as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what polish remover the other reviewers used, but I literally threw my bottle in the trash after the first time I used it!!  I had my toenails painted with a dark red glitter-type of polish and NONE of it came off!  My nails were with a clear French manicure and even with a clear polish, it didn&#x27;t get all the polish off.  I have over 100 reviews.  I have nothing to gain (or lose) by writing a negative review.  This polish remover is WORTHLESS!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this to remove glitters or anything like that. But for ordinary creamy nail polish, I leave this remover on for more than 10 sec and nothing, nothing comes off. Also it is definitely oil-based, and is just too messy to handle. Not worth a buck</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  I can use this without having to air out the bathroom like I did with traditional removers and my nails were not dry or dull.  Never going back to any other polish remover</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t smell like chemical. oily, but can raise just with water . not doing a very good job to remove polish. need to put some pressure on it.</li>
    <li> This polish removes absolutely anything. You have to be careful not to touch it to any nail polish you don&#x27;t want removed because it doesn&#x27;t evaporate like acetone remover so it stays on your hands after you&#x27;ve removed whatever polish you want to. The lavender smell is great and doesn&#x27;t have any trace of chemical smells.</li>
    <li> It is very oily so you only need a little bit, but it works great. After using those other nail polish removers, my nails were left dry and brittle. Not with this product. My nails feel nice and moisturized. I love this product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish remover!! It has such a light, pleasant scent (lavender), which is unheard of for nail polish remover. I feel good about my health and the environment when using this product. I switched to all natural polish a few years ago (I like Acquarella) and in conjunction with this remover, I&#x27;ve never looked back! You do have to scrub for a little longer, but really it&#x27;s only maybe a minute longer overall. Well worth it considering the health benefits.</li>
    <li> Awesome product- great value for the price, comes in an awesome glass bottle, and works better than other natural nail polish removers that I&#x27;ve tried. Also smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I can not believe how awesome this nail polish remover is!  Ordinarily I hate taking of my polish because I hate the smell, but this stuff smells great.  I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be smelly, but I was surprised to find that it actually works, too!  Removed my red polish with just a little more scrubbing than the acetone removers.  Also, unlike the acetone remover it did not turn my fingers red.  You will not regret this purchase, can not recommend it highly enough!!</li>
    <li> No Chemical smell, took polish off in seconds. I used one cotton round for all fingers. Very nice lavender scent.</li>
