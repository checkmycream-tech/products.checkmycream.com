      <li>Natural color, pleasant quality.  </li>
      <li>It is natural and stays on lips quite good.</li>
      <li>and I use it when I wear reds but the rose petal is my clear favorite</li>
      <li>New favorite!</li>
      <li>The lip glaze might seem a bit pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I put chapstick on first, then the glaze because I think it gives me more moisture.</li>
      <li>yes, it is pricey, but it is nice to be able to wear lipstick like a big girl...</li>
      <li>but I liked the natural color</li>
      <li>The color is very flattering and I will buy this glaze again for sure.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see all natural products, as I have contact dermatitis to many chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Its very pretty, a bit darker than I thought it&#x27;d be</li>
      <li>Also this is a very flattering shade (Rose Petal) highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The first day I used the Peach Bellini (a gorgeous color btw), I had to physically remove it.  </li>
      <li>Excellent neutral and long lasting with out the toxic gunk,Yea!</li>
      <li>I will be trying another shade of this product because I do enjoy it so much.</li>
      <li>and I love that it&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
      <li>Nice feel and stay but too pink for me.</li>
      <li>I used this once and have now thrown it into my drawer, most likely to never be used again.  </li>
      <li>so far I really like this lip color, so despite my concerns, I enjoy the product very much.</li>
      <li>They were super smooth and dry.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>it has a light waxy scent with a TINY hint of berry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Very drying to the lips.  </li>
      <li>My lip is the light version of this color just a bit pale, and when I put and this lipstick it looks much deeper but super natural looking .</li>
      <li>It feels light and it does moisturize to some extent but not much.</li>
      <li>Another review commented that it was thin, which is true, but it&#x27;s longer than most lipsticks.</li>
      <li>The only reason I withheld a star was that I was trying to find something slightly lighter and more neutral ( but this was pretty close</li>
      <li>I have no problems with the new products.  </li>
      <li>This product is very soft, opaque and gooey.  </li>
      <li>I expected a very light and sheer lip balm, but what I received was something else entirely.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the rose petal as it is a really subtle, pretty pink.  </li>
      <li>after i put it on, i leave it on for a few minutes then blot lightly.</li>
      <li>I did some research and found that tocopheral-a is natural vitamin E with acetic acid added to it aka carboxylic acid, which I am allergic to.  </li>
      <li>Lot numbers indicated the make-up was old.  </li>
      <li>Very nice organic lipstick--a little pinker than color shows, at least on me.  </li>
      <li>Kind of pale pink.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on long, and doesn&#x27;t really impress me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many people are aware of what ingredients go into making most lipsticks - it&#x27;s really disgusting.  </li>
      <li>I have become squeamish about chemicals and their effect, even potential effect, on my body and am going as natural as possible.  </li>
      <li>i am allergic to normal lipstick due to the petroleum.</li>

<li> i am allergic to normal lipstick due to the petroleum.</li>
<li> other natural lipsticks i have tried dried out my lips a little, but could just be wiped right off!</li>
<li> I am always looking for natural makeup, but some of the other natural companies fall short on color intensity and usually their lipstick/gloss wears off after an hour.  </li>
<li> Does not dry out lips like conventional lipsticks.</li>
<li> it has stayed on for at least 4 hours even while eating and drinking like normal!</li>
<li> Goes on creamy, stays on well, doesn&#x27;t dry out</li>
<li> (rare for me; most of these type of lip colorings either make my lips sting and burn, or look horrible on me.  </li>
<li> I have dry lips</li>
<li> Their other products have tocopheral-a, a form of vitamin E that is not natural.  </li>
<li> Not too purple, not too brown, not too orange, not too garish or pink, etc.</li>
<li> I spent almost $100.00 on makeup that is going in the garbage.    </li>
<li> I like the color, but the lipstick feels far too thick and gooey.</li>

<li> This item, however, does not live up to their usual standards.  </li>
<li> This performs as well as Dr. Hauschka, for half the price.</li>
<li> This color was a little darker than I anticipated.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thin, about a third of the diameter of an ordinary lipstick.</li>
<li> the stick toppled  and I could see it was broken about half-way down the tube.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, within a few hours it felt like my lips had been peeled.  </li>
<li> This arrived broken.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this product. Goes on great and stays put. I put chapstick on first, then the glaze because I think it gives me more moisture. The color is very flattering and I will buy this glaze again for sure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to find a lip glaze that I can use with confidence, knowing the ingredients are all natural. Great color, long lasting, perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn between 2.5 and 3 stars. This arrived broken. It&#x27;s hugely expensive.  After removing the outer wrapping and  twisting the wand just enough .... the stick toppled  and I could see it was broken about half-way down the tube. It&#x27;s very thin, about a third of the diameter of an ordinary lipstick. I knew it would be impossible to return so I&#x27;ve tried to make do.</li>
    <li> I expected a very light and sheer lip balm, but what I received was something else entirely.  This product is very soft, opaque and gooey.  I usually love this company as they pay close attention to what goes into their products, and they make some wonderful stuff.  This item, however, does not live up to their usual standards.  I used this once and have now thrown it into my drawer, most likely to never be used again.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> The color is fabulous and looks amazing on my skin. It feels light and it does moisturize to some extent but not much. I have dry lips but if I apply lip but beneath the lipstick, it helps me. Is not kiss proof but stays longer.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, easy to apply and I love that it&#x27;s 100% natural. I don&#x27;t know how many people are aware of what ingredients go into making most lipsticks - it&#x27;s really disgusting.  I feel good about using this product and about how it looks and performs.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Goes on creamy, stays on well, doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.&lt;br /&gt;The downfall is it&#x27;s the perfect color when you first put it on and for about thirty minutes. Then the color changes. I will be trying another shade of this product because I do enjoy it so much.</li>
    <li> I like the product. The only reason I withheld a star was that I was trying to find something slightly lighter and more neutral ( but this was pretty close and I use it every day and I am looking for a neutralizing lipstick color to add to this).</li>
    <li> Very nice organic lipstick--a little pinker than color shows, at least on me.  I like the presentation case, carry it with me!</li>
    <li> Nice neutral pleasant, pretty color.  Not too purple, not too brown, not too orange, not too garish or pink, etc. Best of all, this is a nice creamy lip treatment and lip color~ Feels wonderful on! New favorite! Whew! (rare for me; most of these type of lip colorings either make my lips sting and burn, or look horrible on me.  This one works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see all natural products, as I have contact dermatitis to many chemicals.  I ordered mascara, lip gloss, eye shadow and eye liner.  This color was a little darker than I anticipated.  Unfortunately, within a few hours it felt like my lips had been peeled.  They were super smooth and dry. This lasted until the next morning.    This product has vitamins, but I don&#x27;t know if it has vitamin E.  Their other products have tocopheral-a, a form of vitamin E that is not natural.  I did some research and found that tocopheral-a is natural vitamin E with acetic acid added to it aka carboxylic acid, which I am allergic to.  There are many articles on the dermatis, blisters and problems with tocopheral-a.    I wrote to the manufacturer, Purity Cosmetics, asking for the MSDS/label, materials safety data sheet.  It&#x27;s been over three days and I have received no response to them.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this company and will not buy from them again.  I spent almost $100.00 on makeup that is going in the garbage.    Update:  Purity Cosmetics did contact me and replace all make-up.  Lot numbers indicated the make-up was old.  I have no problems with the new products.  In fact, I&#x27;ve ordered more products, but am ordering from their website.</li>
    <li> This performs as well as Dr. Hauschka, for half the price. It is moisturizing, goes on smoothly, but doesn&#x27;t smudge easily. Another review commented that it was thin, which is true, but it&#x27;s longer than most lipsticks. I find the shape fits better in my purse without being bulky. It also smells &amp; tastes great, not that I&#x27;m eating it intentionally. I like this colour for this season. It&#x27;s current, but will wear well into fall.</li>
    <li> The product has no smell and doesn&#x27;t taste like chemicals as many lipsticks can.  This is a huge plus!  But I don&#x27;t care for the color on my lips.  Kind of pale pink.  I&#x27;ve been using it as a cream blush and it works well that way.</li>
    <li> Nice feel and stay but too pink for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent neutral and long lasting with out the toxic gunk,Yea!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Does not dry out lips like conventional lipsticks. Also this is a very flattering shade (Rose Petal) highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have become squeamish about chemicals and their effect, even potential effect, on my body and am going as natural as possible.  I have this in 2 shades.  I prefer the rose petal as it is a really subtle, pretty pink.  I also have rose hip and I use it when I wear reds but the rose petal is my clear favorite</li>
    <li> Very smooth, color rich.</li>
    <li> Very drying to the lips.  Terrible!</li>
    <li> Its very pretty, a bit darker than I thought it&#x27;d be but I liked the natural color it had.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell a lot like berries... it has a light waxy scent with a TINY hint of berry.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that the tube doesn&#x27;t have any ingredient information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED this brands blush and so far I really like this lip color, so despite my concerns, I enjoy the product very much.</li>
    <li> i love this product!! i am allergic to normal lipstick due to the petroleum. i have tried other types- lip stain: which works for about 4 hours and dries out my lips very badly, causing some peeling. other natural lipsticks i have tried dried out my lips a little, but could just be wiped right off! this one, so far, is the best! it smells nice and moisturizes my lips. after i put it on, i leave it on for a few minutes then blot lightly. it has stayed on for at least 4 hours even while eating and drinking like normal! i am very happy i tried it! yes, it is pricey, but it is nice to be able to wear lipstick like a big girl... when your 30+. lol!!</li>
    <li> I like the color, but the lipstick feels far too thick and gooey. It doesn&#x27;t stay on long, and doesn&#x27;t really impress me. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lipstick for about two years and I am very satisfied. It is natural and stays on lips quite good.</li>
    <li> Natural color, pleasant quality.  most important its organic-no harm for health. will buy again. i do recommend this lipstick to buy/</li>
    <li> Feels good, looks good, tastes good, good for your body.  Actually love all things 100% PURE and this is my latest favorite.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for natural makeup, but some of the other natural companies fall short on color intensity and usually their lipstick/gloss wears off after an hour.  The first day I used the Peach Bellini (a gorgeous color btw), I had to physically remove it.  It lasted through my entire workday.  The lip glaze might seem a bit pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Elegant beautiful color! My lip is the light version of this color just a bit pale, and when I put and this lipstick it looks much deeper but super natural looking . Hope it&#x27;s made of rose ...</li>
    <li> not super long wearing but the color is nice and lipstick is creamy and shiny</li>
    <li> I loved this!! Felt so good going on...and CRUELTY-FREE!! Thanks</li>
