<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fast shipping! My God-daughter is very content! !</li>
    <li> Great spiral curls.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> first time i used it it stopped working and i love how it styled my hair just broke on me half way thru my hair style</li>
    <li> Works great in my daughters hard to curl hair. I loved that it came with a glove for her to use at first.</li>
    <li> Love this. My 12 year old uses it daily</li>
    <li> I loved it. It curls my hair nicely and shipped in 2 days</li>
    <li> Was a gift for someone else.</li>
    <li> Works fine but came in a box that was not from Revlon. Like it had been repackaged. The heat glove it came with smelled like chemicals, was itchy, never used it. The wand works great though. The only problem with the wand itself is that anyone who sees it says it looks like a sex toy. UPDATE: Two years later and it stills works fine. I prefer a tapered clipless barrel curler but that one broke so I&#x27;ve been using this one. It get the job done. And idk why people are saying this doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, it&#x27;s plenty hot enough for my thick and curly hair.  Also, a tip, hair burns at the same temperature as paper which is 451F so yall shouldn&#x27;t be using tools that are super hot anyways. Unless you want to burn your hair off.</li>
    <li> worth every cent of the money. it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this today at a Conway department store to use to keep up the style I got at the hair salon. I was very surprised the heat went up to 400  degrees and grateful that it was adjustable.  The wand did a perfect job on my relaxed African-american hair!  I looked it up on Amazon to see what the real price was because I got mine for $4.99!  Amazing deal for a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my best friend and she loves it! Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and now I&#x27;m ordering one for myself. It is by far the best curler I&#x27;ve seen. She is able to get amazing tight or wavy curls that last all day and use ZERO product! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> we bought this for my daughter for Christmas. she uses it everyday, and loves it.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old loves it.  Uses it every other day.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a gift for my birthday, It&#x27;s nice once you get used to it. It also heats up fairly quick which I like.</li>
    <li> I love this wand, it is great for long hair and the curls really do stay in place. My sister loved my wand so much she even bought one for herself!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get this to work right. Maybe its just too hard for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to get use to if you are accustomed to a regular wand but once you get the hang of it it is really easy. Bought for my daughter and she likes it</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me . Got it because I thought it would cut the time it takes me to curl my hair in half . I&#x27;m mixed with kind of thick hair that&#x27;s almost waist length . Should have gotten a regular wand.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Just as described.  Would remmond this item.</li>
    <li> I got it for my daughter and she hated it she keep burning herself and she said &amp;#34;it made weird curls.&amp;#34; Then i bought her one of those just straight ones she uses it at least 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I wish I could rate this better, but I can&#x27;t give more than one star to a product that fell apart during gentle usage.  I opened it up, plugged it in, and got about 3 curls in my hair before the wand literally snapped off the base and dangled from the exposed wires inside.  Dangerous and cheap.  I just put in my return order.</li>
    <li> Part of the black paint that covers the heat part was missing.</li>
    <li> You can get big bouncy curls in a few minutes. This curling wand get really hot, so it only takes 5 to 10 seconds to set a curl.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> bought for granddaughter and she loves it, uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is amazing. I use it on day 2 of not washing my hair for soft beachy waves.</li>
    <li> I will never use another hot tool for curls again. This is it. The best. I curled my hair on a Friday night and had amazing tight, curls. Woke up Saturday morning with nice voluminous bouncy curls and even Sunday morning I had great curls. I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day because it is TERRIBLE for it. I don&#x27;t always have time to style my hair in the morning before work and I dislike applying to much heat to it. THIS IS TRULY A GODSEND. Volume and hold with beautiful results. This is a phenomenal product.</li>
    <li> This curling iron didn&#x27;t keep curls in my hair. i also found it a little difficult to use - the plastic end is too small, barely enough to hold onto and i burnt myself a couple times. I ended up selling it elsewhere...</li>
    <li> Super fun curling wand.gives great curls, loose or tigh tdependimg on how you hold the hair. Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> Impossible for me to use without getting burned.  Advertised as a wand but just a twisted hot iron.  Sent it back.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the best hair purchases I have in recent time.  I was not to happy about the regular hair wand, it was hard to use and difficult for me to achieve the look I wanted,  This bubble wand is amazing, it heats up really well so you must be careful when using it, I did burn my self the first time I used it, after that I was aware of how hot it can be so I use it with caution.  The waves this achieves are gorgeous, they stay on all day.</li>
    <li> I like the size of this wand, it&#x27;s considerably longer than the short, more expensive own I last owned. However, it does not heat as high as the 400 degree ones, &amp; so I have to leave it in my hair a lot longer. Otherwise it works well.</li>
    <li> MAKES CURLING SO EASY!</li>
    <li> I have super straight hair and had yet to find a curling iron that held curl in my hair. This put a nice curl in my hair AND it held. I had to run my fingers threw it to make it look more natural, but I was grateful to have found something that worked!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a cheaper version of the NuMe Pearl Wand. This met my expectation, and compared to the NuMe pearl wand, it does a pretty good likeness of &amp;#34;mermaid curls.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern I do have is if it will last as long as NuMe wands. But that&#x27;s just a wait and see game.</li>
    <li> it does work, but with a LOT of effort on your part. not the simple wand i was seeking for my needs.</li>
    <li> The Heat is great. Naturally Straight hair a must. But it is a lot of work with THICK and curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love love love this wand.</li>
    <li> I live in Belgium and at first I was wondering if it was worth the risk of it not working in my country but I&#x27;m really glad I took the risk. I read somewhere that although it says it&#x27;s adapted to worldwide dual voltage, it starts smoking when you plug it in. That didn&#x27;t happen to me and I&#x27;m really happy about that, because I love this wand. I wasn&#x27;t used to using clipless wands, but I like it much better than the ones with a clip. It&#x27;s easier, faster, less fussy,... AND the Curl Magic works a lot better than any iron I&#x27;ve ever tried. You can get such nice different curls, they&#x27;re very natural and they last for days. You can get looks from extremely curly to beautiful beachy waves, all with one tool. I really hope it lives as long as it works well, because man, is this a bargain. It didn&#x27;t take me any time to learn how to work with this at all. For me it was effortless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it in Europe, keep in mind that you will need a North-America to Europe plug adapter.  It&#x27;s an A-type plug (with two poles) but keep in mind that it has one wide pole and one thinner one. The usual plug adapters have two holes of the same width. However, you can find an adapter like that quite easily and it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot. Definitely worth the investment!</li>
    <li> We have the straight style wrap around iron and it is good without having a clip....but this one is even better!  It makes beautiful curls and they seems to last a lot longer than any iron we have tried.  My teenagers say the bulbous spots make it easier to wrap the hair and makes the job a lot quicker than the straight version.</li>
    <li> I loved it! The curls are perfect. I bought this after watching youtube reviews. The only thing is the glove it comes with, it sucks. Its itchy and uncomfortable,  but I just curl without the glove</li>
    <li> Bought this for my niece who loves to fix and curl her hari. She is 16 years old. She is no stranger to curling irons, wands, straighteners, etc.  This item &amp;#34;fell flat&amp;#34; of all expectations. It didn&#x27;t seem curl well. The curls that survived, did not last for long.</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews I was excited about this product the packaging doesnt look anything like the pictures I also received a itchy pink glove not a black one curls ok not really curls more like waves I winded up putting my hair in flexi rods</li>
    <li> Haha I thought this was like anal beads but in a long stick lol</li>
    <li> Hard to use,sloppy results. I pin set my hair,but some nights,I am just too tired. Bought this for mornings I didn&#x27;t pin set. It just makes loose, I slept on my hair waves. Bobby pins are like a buck,dont waste money on this.</li>
    <li> I have never in MY LIFE had a curler that actually kept my curls in all day. Best Hair product i&#x27;ve ever purchased. A Must Buy!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas after asking for it several times.  I was so excited when I unwrapped it, unfortunately I had a cold during the remainder of the holiday season and just recently got to try it out.  I read and followed the instructions very carefully; I tried both methods of curling.  I had no trouble getting my hair around the device however I never got any results other than a sloppy half wave, it kind of just looked like bed head.  I played with the temperature settings, I have medium thickness hair in some spots and thick hair in other areas due to the layering.  My hair is what I would consider long, the longest part is well to the middle of my back, so I went ahead and set it to the highest setting on my last try.  I attempted again both methods of curling as well as trying thinner strips of hair then thicker strips.  In the end unfortunately I just got a messy bed head result no matter what I attempted so I gave it up after an hour or so.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with hair longer than your shoulders, as I&#x27;ve learned, by reading and watching other reviews.</li>
    <li> The hype behind another brand that has been highly publicized is really just that hype. The only wand I wanted was the pearl from Nume they do have high quality products and frequent sales however prices are still quite steep.&lt;br /&gt;This did all of the things that Nume&#x27;s pearl wand claims. I do have a friend who is a licensed cosmetologist and specializes in hair, this does this exact same and has (like Nume) a tourmaline coated barrel. Love this does just what it promises and for less than the so-called higher ends, I&#x27;ve been a happy Revlon consumer for years, they&#x27;re always on top of their game and have great customer service. I recommend purchasing as I did from Revlon not only fulfilled by them, my first purchase was missing items and not in original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hunting</li>
    <li> It curls, but doesn&#x27;t always it sometimes just makes waves . Also it curls best when you take a shower than blow dry than you curl your hair!</li>
    <li> As soon as  my daughter got it she curled her hair and said it was the best curling wand she has ever had and she has had many. She lent it to her friends and they all love it. They get together and curl and do other styles to each others hair. Its great.</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand! Takes one or two practice sessions, but it is super easy once you get the hang of it. The wand heats up quickly and produces a curl within a few seconds. If you&#x27;re like me, and not the best at using a real curling iron, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great product i love it, but i chose to buy it from walmart instead of amazon, ALOT cheaper</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Works great. The glove is ineffective but the wand is awesome.</li>
    <li> Awesome! It makes my hair so curly! The glove is awful though, nothing more than a spa scrub glove, luckily the very tip doesn&#x27;t get hot so if you&#x27;re careful, you don&#x27;t have to wear it!</li>
    <li> THE PERFECT STYLING TOOL FOR ANYONE.. .SO SIMPLE ANYONE CAN FIX THE HAIR LIKE A PROFESSIONAL.... MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT</li>
    <li> Part of this average rating is #1, smaller barrel than I expected. #2, lack of experience by me on trying to use this type of product. I like the idea of heat level control. It shipped quickly</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and works for very thick hard to curl hair like mine! My hair has never curled with anything else but this! And the great thing is that the curl last with a little bit of hair spray! I also like the globe although it can make your hair a little staticy</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended it to me and she was right!  It is great!  I love, love, love it! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it as it is priced extremely reasonable too!!</li>
    <li> Was very inespensive in comparison with the prices in Walmart. Also came very fast and very easy to use it&#x27;s almost quite impossible to not achieve a wave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my girlfriend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Amazing it works curls and does exactly what it says. I love it. I love everything about it including the glove and it came right on time. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this curling wand, her hair looks amazing now. Would recommend this product to anyone, easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t that gorgeous. Tangles hair a lot and hard to use.</li>
    <li> This is brilliant!! It holds curls for days!! I am completely in awe of how great my hair looks!!</li>
    <li> Easy handling.no problem to us in germany dual voltage</li>
    <li> The curling iron worked well once I got the hang of it but it was not easy at first. The glove is useless bc it makes your hair very staticy</li>
    <li> Works great. My 10 year old daughter wanted this item. I&#x27;ve done her hair with it twice already and it&#x27;s awesome. She has medium to long length hair. The waves stay all day, I put it on almost high heat for best result. We paid $18.00 for it and I believe that was a fair price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best styling tool I&#x27;ve purchased in the last 20 years. Hair dryer, straightener, Curling wand... the trifecta!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is so damn easy to use it&#x27;s almost unreal. I am never unhappy with how my hair has come out afterward. I get complimented on my hair almost every time I use it. The first two times I used it I held the hair in place too long ad the curls were way too tight. I was going for more of a beachy look, and the instructions CLEARLY say to hold the hair in place for only about 3-5 seconds. I have found that for a half inch section of medium thickness hair, with the tool set just below &amp;#34;max&amp;#34;, 4 seconds is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Obviously the higher you have it set to, the less time you hold your hair in place on the iron&lt;br /&gt;2) Hold the wand in the your right hand when dong the left side of your head, and the left hand when doing the right side.&lt;br /&gt;3) Alternate how you twist the hair sections around the wand. Twist some towards your front, and some towards your back. This creates that uneven beachy look.&lt;br /&gt;4) Divide your hair into two sections, and upper and a lower.&lt;br /&gt;5) Do the lower first BUT only start the curling wand about 3/4 from the root.  Don&#x27;t start twisting right at the scalp... this will cause too tight of a curl and make that layer of hair appear shorter. Starting lower and not holding the hair in place for as long in that section will create a longer, looser under layer.&lt;br /&gt;6) For the top layer, begin twisting as close to the scalp as you can get without hurting yourself. This will create lift and give that naturally wavy appearance. Do not hold the iron in place for too long on that top layer! Use thicker sections of hair if thats what you&#x27;re going to do.&lt;br /&gt;7) Stop the twisting with about an inch of hair left at the bottom of the section being left uncurled. This creates the beachy look. Wavy hair doesn&#x27;t have tightly curled ends, so if you&#x27;re looking for the wavy beach look this tip will make all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Move quickly. Grab a section, twist it, hold it and count for 4 seconds, let it fall loose, grab another section immediately and repeat. I finish my whole head in under ten minutes. The longer you take to do it, the less natural wavy it looks. Its imperfections are what make the style.&lt;br /&gt;8) Juice it up with a little hair spray to hold in place and preserve cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;9) works best on hair thats a day dirty.&lt;br /&gt;10) looks great with headbands, bandanas, bobby pins, and even a cute pony tail&lt;br /&gt;11) lots of tutorials and reviews on this type of styling tool, and most of the reviewers use it incorrectly, hold it in for way too long, etc. The instructions say 3-5 seconds, and thats what you should do. Keep it moving quickly and it will come out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this tips help you out!  I friggin love this thing and I use it about three times a week. I straight my hair the day I wash it, and then i use the second the day. By now everyone at work knows I didn&#x27;t wash my hair based on when its wavy hahah.  Best took ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I used the glove ONCE. It&#x27;s really not that serious of an undertaking that you should need to use that glove. Once you&#x27;ve done it a couple times, you&#x27;ll know how your hair reacts and the tool is very consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; HOORAY FOR THE REVLOG CURL COLLECTION BUBBLE CURLING WAND!!look this tip will make all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Move quickly.

    <li> This iron is okay but did not come w/ the glove and we are having a hard time using it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for curling for spiral prom look.</li>
    <li> Revlon gets it right as always perfect!</li>
    <li> Loved it but it broke after 6 months. Boo</li>
    <li> I bought this product due to its promising look, but it failed to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;it comes out more wavy than curly, and I it is not what I hoped it would be. very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I must be a spazz cause I could not get use to using this style of curling iron.  gave it to a friend who loved it. oh well!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is aweful! It is very difficult to use and the curl is no better than that of a regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Good value, well made. A little difficult to learn how to use but heats nicely.</li>
    <li> This is a seriously great styling tool!  I am awful at using tools, but this one is easy, fast, and does a great job in spite of me.  It gives my shoulder length hair really pretty beachy waves or tighter spirals...whatever I&#x27;m in the mood for...and they last.  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> My daughter bought one and I knew I had gonna be one too. Love it.</li>
    <li> Super product, with the price and quality! Great transaction!</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling rod with excitement, anticipating beautiful spiral curls as stated in the other reviews. However, my experience has not been that of others here. The tool has been a challenge, not adhering to my hair in any manner that results in a curl of any kind. It could be that I am not mechanically inclined to manage this curling tool as required, or that my hair is too thick for it to operate effectively. I have not used it since my first few attempts to perform the impossible. It does not get very hot and the glove seems to be more of a nuisance than a heat protective shield. I went back to my regular curling iron wand. My hair holds a curl that only water can destroy with this method. Not impressive.</li>
    <li> made my grandchild very happy</li>
    <li> doesnt work on my hair, i didnt notice and wave or anything a regular curling iron provides more curl and i use the wand</li>
    <li> HEATS UP QUICK!! 5 stars</li>
    <li> Product worked great, I was a bit clumsy with it at first and didn&#x27;t get a perfect look but I defiantly had smooth silky curls. With some practice no one will be able to tell I only spent 25$. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel or look damaged. I used a little Smoothing serum and I&#x27;m satisfied even after a first attempt.</li>
    <li> I just know this works bc I seen how pretty it leaves your curls</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it 0 stars. The product was in the wrong box, no glove and it doesn&#x27;t curl.</li>
    <li> Meh..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is okay.. I used a tapered ‘hot tools’ bubble wand that a friend had and I got great results so I purchased this Revlon one because it was slightly cheaper. I usually used the traditional curling irons and I like the curls I get with that one (T3). But I also liked the beach waves I got with my friend’s wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revlon curling wand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- The cord is way too short IMO, I could barely hold it the way I needed to in order to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;- The bubble design just wasn’t for me. The package shows you two different techniques – wrapping hair over the  bubble and wrapping hair in between the bubble. Wrapping your hair over the bubbles itself gives you lopsided/unattractive curls.. it honestly almost looks like you didn’t even do your hair. Definitely didn’t give me the beach waves I was looking for. Wrapping my hair in between the bubbles gave me a more desirable look however, the size of the barrel in between the bubbles is really small (maybe 1/4” or possibly 1/2&#x27;) so I got really tight Taylor Swift curls when I was actually looking for back waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up really fast and stays hot.&lt;br /&gt;- The product is sturdy; great integrity.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy access to on/off and temperature buttons.&lt;br /&gt;- I really like the rubber stopper at the end, it makes the hair easier to hold without fear of being burned.</li>
    <li> The curls you get are perfect. It takes a while to get the hang of it, but after 1 or 2 uses, your hair will look incredible. It looks as natural as you can get with a curling iron. I wish I would have gotten it sooner! The only thing that may be an in convenience is the cord is super long. I love that it&#x27;s long, but it does get caught on things like your bathroom cabinet knobs. I love this product. I would buy it all over again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  &amp;#60;3 it already!!  - The wife</li>
    <li> In the item description it says the wand is dual voltage... its not! I plugged it in and it started smoking!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely a must have for effortless waves and curls! Haven&#x27;t put it down since I got it! My hair looks amazing when I wave it! Easy to use and the curls/waves last really long usually about 2-3 days before you have the re do it!</li>
    <li> It curls amazly and it works well. I have very thin hair other hair curls didn&#x27;t work but I love this one.</li>
    <li> This Revlon Bubble Curling Wand was fabulous but only while it lasted. I used it everyday and was very happy with it until it stopped working after a mere four weeks, for no apparent reason. I wish I could return it and get another one exactly the same, but the returning period has expired. I&#x27;ll have to get a more expensive one next time. At least I feel that the money I spent on this curling wand was worth the four weeks of great curls.</li>
    <li> Great curls and awesome price! Gets the job done. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Remington CI95AC/2 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Wand is better. The curls don&#x27;t look so weird as they do with the Revlon Curl Collection Bubble Curling Wand, Pink.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing! Whenever I used to curl my hair before, the curls in my hair would fall out by noon. When I received this in the mail, I was a little skeptical because I had never used a wand before, but once I used it, I was wonderfully surprised at how well it worked. I use it constantly now and I love how it the bubbles can let you style your hair with big curls or loose waves. The only thing I would strongly recommend is to always use the glove that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Omg this its fantastic . I done muy long hair in 5 min .</li>
    <li> I have used it 3 times since I received it and I truly have to say, I just love it! It hears up fast. the cord is very long and you easily move with it, the glove its a plus but I have not really used it because this wand its so easy to use. You will love ur hair, cant get enough of it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Makes beautiful beach waves.</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptical upon purchasing this clipless wand for my 11-year-old daughter but after just a few tries she has managed to learn to do it on her own. The results are a head full of pretty waves, not spiral curls, that actually last all day with hairspray in her very thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is amazing ! We used it for cheer competition when we curled our pony tails and not only did the curls look amazing on all of the girls no matter there hair type (short long thick thin didn&#x27;t matter) but they stayed over night which gives you an I was of how great it is ! Only a few needed to be touched up ! I strongly recommend it !</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  My daughter used this and her hair stayed curled for two days almost three.  She has super thick hair too.  Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand! My entire life I have never had curls that would hold. In the past I have spent 6 hours curling my hair (on multiple occasions) for the curls to fall out within an hour later. After watching a tutorial video on how to use this I was ecstatic! My hair looked amazing and the curls held for days! I would get so many compliments and I always tell ppl to go and buy this. It does take some practice to get the hang of a wand curling iron but I am now looking for a traditional wand for a traditional curl only because this gave me new hope. I&#x27;m still doubting something else could tip this tho!</li>
    <li> Received super quick, new in package and love what it did for my hair. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I used this! it curls beautifully! I love how the head settings go up to 400˚, so when I curl my hair, it only took about 5 seconds on each strand! Way faster, so now I can curl my hair before school without it taking 40 min!</li>
