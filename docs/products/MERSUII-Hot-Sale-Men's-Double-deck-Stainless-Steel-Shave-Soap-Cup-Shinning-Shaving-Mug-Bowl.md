      <li>and it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s a great value for the money.</li>
      <li>cup is a great size for my need.</li>
      <li>Very nice shaving soap bowl.  </li>

      <li>and he likes the size of it just fine.</li>
      <li>There is no way any shave soap could fit in here.</li>
      <li>My husband can&#x27;t even fit 1/4 sample bar of shave soap in this bowl.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done shaving, it rinses easily and quickly.</li>
      <li>It might be ideal for something else but not for holding a round of shave soap.</li>
      <li>Holds temperature very well and is easy to hold in one hand.</li>
      <li>It weighs nothing, feels unbelievably cheap, and to top it off, holds about 3oz total.</li>
      <li>I typically fill it with hot water and makes the right amount of a very smooth warm shaving lather</li>
      <li>Basic bowl, nothing special, works OK.</li>
      <li>It is just the right size, fits well in my hand.  </li>
      <li>It easily fits on the shelf in my medicine cabinet, yet provides ample room for a standard brush.</li>

      <li>you&#x27;ll notice how much sloshes out and it creates a bit of mess.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product took forever to get to me and is super duper tiny.</li>
      <li>SUPER DUPER TINY!</li>
      <li>this is decent with shaving</li>
      <li>of decent quality, however ensure you notice the size specs.</li>
      <li>Gets cold very fast, but shape is good.</li>
      <li>The only reason it gets 2 stars is because it&#x27;s machined well, and if you&#x27;ve got tiny hands and a tiny shave brush, this one would probably be fine for you.</li>

<li> This is a nice shaving bowl, but is a little too small for the shaving puck I bought - another half inch in diameter</li>

<li> Sadly, I thought I was getting a stainless steel shave soap cup - meaning a stainless steel cup that will hold my round of shave soap.</li>

<li> A total waste of money.</li>
<li> If you need something to hold a round of shave soap similar to Williams - this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
<li> Here upon my foray into wet shaving...i decided to buy a bowl for my shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> : squeeze dollop of cream into cup, wet brush, whip the cream with the brush in the cup, and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> other reason i gave it 3/5...</li>
<li> small enough to carry anywhere plus wont take up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so its a little messy each morning.</li>
<li> This cup is to small to hold a round of shave soap.</li>
<li> A bit small but holds temp well.</li>
<li> This thing is about the size of a small tea cup</li>
<li> were wrong and this bowl will not hold a standard sized disk of shave soap.  </li>
<li> DONT use a hard soap with this...just wont fit.&lt;br</li>
<li> The brush fits down inside, but there&#x27;s so little room from side to side that creating any foam without just sloshing all of the soap all over your sink is basically impossible.  </li>

    <li> This is a nice shaving bowl, but is a little too small for the shaving puck I bought - another half inch in diameter and it would be perfect. Still, it&#x27;s a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I love it better than the pyrex I was using!</li>
    <li> This cup is to small to hold a round of shave soap. If you need something to hold a round of shave soap similar to Williams - this isn&#x27;t it. It might be ideal for something else but not for holding a round of shave soap. Sadly, I thought I was getting a stainless steel shave soap cup - meaning a stainless steel cup that will hold my round of shave soap. This cup will not do that.</li>
    <li> This is essentially plastic. It weighs nothing, feels unbelievably cheap, and to top it off, holds about 3oz total. My shaving brush is about this size. Its a cheap, poor excuse for a shave soap cup. There is no way any shave soap could fit in here. SCAM</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I anticipated. The soap cake fills it up complete;y so its a little messy each morning.</li>
    <li> had to rely on a customer review for product dimensions, as that info was not furnished by the manufacturer.  Turns out, customer provided dimensions were wrong and this bowl will not hold a standard sized disk of shave soap.  Tried to return product, and was told I could not.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice little bowl. Holds temperature very well and is easy to hold in one hand. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Gets cold very fast, but shape is good. Light, good for travel, but not as pleasant to use as ceramic.</li>
    <li> A bit small but holds temp well.</li>
    <li> Here upon my foray into wet shaving...i decided to buy a bowl for my shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;I looked around and saw the MERSUII Double deck stainless steel mug/bowl&lt;br /&gt;the 1st thing i noticed when i got this from Amazon i was like..&lt;br /&gt;Whoa...this is small.&lt;br /&gt;(as you see from the picture,its tiny and i don&#x27;t have gorilla hands either)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now aesthetically it looks nice (part of the reason i gave it 3 stars)...but for its practical use,it&#x27;s too small.&lt;br /&gt;Once you lather up the soap ...you&#x27;ll notice how much sloshes out and it creates a bit of mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason i gave it 3/5...is i figured out the use of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A travel shave bowl....small enough to carry anywhere plus wont take up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now mind you...DONT use a hard soap with this...just wont fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but this is decent with shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you travel alot and use it as a travel shave bowl...but thats it</li>
    <li> of decent quality, however ensure you notice the size specs. This thing is about the size of a small tea cup</li>
    <li> This bowl is way smaller than I realized.  The brush fits down inside, but there&#x27;s so little room from side to side that creating any foam without just sloshing all of the soap all over your sink is basically impossible.  Also, this doesn&#x27;t hold heat as well as others have said.  All in all, this is a total waste of money for me. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because it&#x27;s machined well, and if you&#x27;ve got tiny hands and a tiny shave brush, this one would probably be fine for you.</li>
    <li> Basic bowl, nothing special, works OK.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaving soap bowl.  It is just the right size, fits well in my hand.  I typically fill it with hot water and makes the right amount of a very smooth warm shaving lather</li>
    <li> My shaving cream routine: squeeze dollop of cream into cup, wet brush, whip the cream with the brush in the cup, and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cup is a great size for my need. It easily fits on the shelf in my medicine cabinet, yet provides ample room for a standard brush. When I&#x27;m done shaving, it rinses easily and quickly. It does what I need without any problems.</li>
    <li> This product took forever to get to me and is super duper tiny. SUPER DUPER TINY! My husband can&#x27;t even fit 1/4 sample bar of shave soap in this bowl. We had a good laugh as he tried to hold it in his hand during his morning shave, but that is the only thing good I have to say. (I&#x27;ve included pics with a razor and votive candle for size comparison.) My daughter will be using this as a mixing bowl for her 18 inch doll. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it, Fits in had well and he likes the size of it just fine.</li>
