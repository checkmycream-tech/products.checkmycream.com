      <li>It is easy to apply and produces results quickly.</li>
      <li>So far I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several skinceutical products &amp; I have really liked all of them.  </li>

      <li>Once I ran out of it, I purchased a new one and it came with a golden color instead of dark brown</li>
      <li>Product was exactly the same as what I originally bought at the dermatologists office, only nearly half the price.  </li>
      <li>This serum has started to lighten my dark spots and smooth out some deep crows feet.</li>
      <li>a little costly, but worth it.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive combination skin, and live in a dry, harsh climate, and this serum is gentle enough to use every day.</li>

    <li> Excellent seller 100% Recommended</li>
    <li> Very good for the skin</li>
    <li> This product was a indication of my dermatologist, it will be my 1st time using this product, I saw some interview and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
    <li> Had this product recommended by my dermatologist as part of my anti-aging regimen. It is great and also helps me control my oily skin. It is easy to apply and produces results quickly. If I do not use for some days, I can notice a change on my skin.</li>
    <li> Did not see any results!  :(.  So I&#x27;m disappointed I spent the money on it!  Not recommending it.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin looks helthier immediately! Seems like she is happy! Perfect to use before the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several skinceutical products &amp; I have really liked all of them.  Just wish they were a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> wow after just 3 days I could see the benefit - now I don&#x27;t go a day without it.  a little costly, but worth it.</li>
    <li> So far I love it. My skin looks better than it did a month ago. My esthetician even commented on how good my skin looked.</li>
    <li> I love this brand! I&#x27;ve been using this every morning after I wash my face since I received it and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference. My skin is noticeably brighter and softer. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals Serum 10 AOX+ is the best C Vitamin! Really works! Even being expensive is worth! My dermatologist always recommends!</li>
    <li> great product for your skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a few days. I am not able to tell whether it has improved my appearance or not. Will use for awhile and see if I can tell a difference. I need to retain a youthful appearance since I try to be available as an extra in movies shot in Spokane.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks the serum turned yellow......waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (in addition to some other Skinceuticals products) for several months.  My skin is noticeably firmer, and has a glow.  My skin has been categorized by &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; by me esthetician.  This product does not irritate.  I use it as directed, after cleansing at night.  It has a smell I can&#x27;t really define, but it absorbs quickly and the scent does not linger.  It&#x27;s a nice introduction to the Skinceuticals &amp;#34;prevent&amp;#34; line.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly the same as what I originally bought at the dermatologists office, only nearly half the price.  I noticed a brightness to my face after 2-3 weeks of using 4 drops once a day in the morning.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Your skin will glow and look healthy.  I think there&#x27;s nothing better than Skinceutical products to put your best face forward!</li>
    <li> I dislike this product.  I see no results and it&#x27;s giving me blackheads !</li>
    <li> Had this prodduct recommended by my dermatologist as part of my anti-aging regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Not only it is great as that but also helps me control my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light texture, it is really easy to apply and produces results quickly - only downside is a strong medical smell.&lt;br /&gt;Use a scented SPF to disguise it! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year. Within two weeks, my skin looked noticeably younger and I started getting carded again (I&#x27;m mid-30s). When I&#x27;ve run out and stopped using it for awhile, my skin starts to look dull and aged. It also helps control oil and reduce acne. I have very sensitive combination skin, and live in a dry, harsh climate, and this serum is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
    <li> This serum has started to lighten my dark spots and smooth out some deep crows feet. I apply the serum directly to these areas and then to the rest of my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation from this product and  would recommend this serum without hesitation.</li>
    <li> The smell of this serum is terrible, it looks like expired while ago.  I hAve tried to use it for 2 days but it remains even in my hands&lt;br /&gt;Im going to try to return it. Also the color is really a dark orange nothing like this serum at all</li>
    <li> Mixed feelings. Last time I bought this, color was darker and texture was ticker. Used it every day for a year and loved it. Once I ran out of it, I purchased a new one and it came with a golden color instead of dark brown and it is not as tick as the previous purchase. Not sure yet what happened.</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful and timely delivery</li>
