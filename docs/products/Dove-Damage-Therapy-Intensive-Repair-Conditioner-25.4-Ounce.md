      <li>Pretty awesome!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry it, curl it, or style it in anyway, just have a good hair cut and use the Dove hair products and that brings out the best in my hair.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly inexpensive and accessible, this is by far the best detangling conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>

      <li>Most days I let my hair air-dry afterwards.</li>
      <li>conditioner smells wonderful from the moment you open it.</li>
      <li>I would have been better off not using any conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love dove hair care products.  </li>
      <li>Though not as shiny as it was with natural products, the difference is incredible.     </li>

      <li>After ironing, it looks even better.</li>
      <li>What a surprise to try a travel size of dove conditioner on a trip and discover that it works better than anything I have ever tried before.</li>

      <li>B001ET7KC2 Dove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Shampoo, Cucumber/Green Tea, 25.4-Fluid Ounces (750 ml)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know it if offers this many benefits for straight haired girls, but I highly recommend it, if for nothing else, then for its amazing detangling powers :)</li>
      <li>After I used it, my hear looks very shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>A great combination of destroying elements to test the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But with all the fun of summer, comes the dryness of the sun, pool and beach.</li>
      <li>Having tried every expensive conditioner I can find, from drugstores to beauty supply stores to department stores, amazing to find a CHEAP grocery-store conditioner is what works better than anything else.</li>
      <li>, I scrub my scalp with just water, I put loads of this conditioner on starting with the ends, and working my way up the hair, but avoiding the roots on the top of my head and around my part.</li>
      <li>Right after popping open the top and smelling the chemical stink of the new formula conditioner I poured some out in my hand and immediately noticed that the conditioner had also changed in texture or viscosity.</li>
      <li>a shampoo- now the comb slides through it very quickly and tangles simply slide out.</li>
      <li>It smooths down her fly-aways and makes her hair look nice and straight (instead of all over the place), just the way that she likes it.</li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
      <li>It just makes my hair really silky and manageable</li>
      <li>But I really haven&#x27;t noticed a change in the structure of my hair or instances of breakage, and I use it almost every day.</li>
      <li>would use Dove Intense Damage Therapy Conditioner once or twice-a-week.</li>
      <li>After a torturous morning of mowing my gigantic yard, I decided to try my sample of Dove Intense Damage Therapy Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have straight, shiny hair that waves when it is humid.</li>
      <li>Really softens hair and works well</li>
      <li>My hair is very prone to split ends, so I thought I would give this line a try.</li>
      <li>This Dove conditioner absorbs through all of my hair and has really helped keep it from becoming dry and frizzy all winter.</li>
      <li>Love this it is my favourite conditioner but with the small bottles here, I run out very fast.</li>
      <li>I have naturally thick, long beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>I had to ask a friend in high school to show me what a split end was because my hair never had split ends.</li>
      <li>My long hair was full of grass, bugs, sunscreen and sweat.  </li>
      <li>After letting it air dry, my hair is soft and the ends appear to be smooth.</li>
      <li>I would put this conditioner right up there with Biolage the slip is the same and your hair will thank you.</li>
      <li>noticed that on the new formula bottles there&#x27;s a little note on the front label near the top which reads \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; and \\&quot;Repairs at hair&#x27;s</li>
      <li>mother has a very sensitive scalp, and this doesn&#x27;t bother it.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair really soft.</li>
      <li>(all within a &#x27;natural&#x27; context) but all to no avail.</li>
      <li>I thought was a complete dud, but she insisted otherwise.</li>
      <li>My scalp became sensitive from yanking on all the knots.</li>
      <li>As far as hair care goes, I&#x27;ll be sticking with Dove from now on.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable and ultra conditioned.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After scrubbing my hair clean from the yard debris, I opened my little sample with my teeth.</li>
      <li>On the days I don use shampoo, I first get my hair all wet</li>
      <li>My hair is very thick and long and most conditioners don&#x27;t really leave all of it feeling soft and pliant.</li>
      <li>For a Dove hair care product I am pleasantly surprised at how rich and thick the conditioner is.</li>
      <li>I have hair that is long, just about to hit my natural waistline.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s one way that you can tell you have the awful new formula and not the great old one.</li>

<li> I have hair that is long, just about to hit my natural waistline.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s one way that you can tell you have the awful new formula and not the great old one.</li>
<li> I have also color treated my hair often, and use a flat iron and curling wand on a regular basis.</li>
<li> My hair is shiny and it brings out my slight natural wave.</li>
<li> My ends tend to get a little dry, but luckily I do not suffer from too much frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> After using this product, my hair was dry and brittle.</li>
<li> This is the cheapest product that she will use on her damaged, dry, color-treated hair.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, but I do condition every single day.</li>
<li> I have long (waist-length), thick hair that tends to be coarse and dry.</li>
<li> Now this new formula conditioner is thin and runny and leaves my hair feeling dry even when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
<li> So now I&#x27;m off to every drugstore and big box store that sells hair care products and buy up every bottle of the old formula because believe me, this new formula is so bad I never want to use it again.</li>
<li> /&gt;It does not weigh hair down and soothes the scalp and hair.</li>
<li> My only complaint is I find it leaves a heavy residue on my hair so in a day</li>
<li> This made my hair greasy, limp, and weighed down.</li>
<li> It also dried out her hair.</li>
<li> So for the past year I&#x27;ve slowly been changing my dirt-poor lifestyle to a &#x27;green&#x27; one.</li>
<li> Usually she dishes out the cash for salon products.</li>
<li> No more.</li>
<li> I love this product for my girls and my terribly tangly hair.</li>
<li> Which means that it tends to get frizzed-out and dull.</li>
<li> It just felt dirty and gross.</li>
<li> I have tried a million different conditioners, some of them very expensive.</li>
<li> even worse than the stink of Dove Intensive Repair is that the conditioner no longer works as well on my hair.</li>
<li> This conditioner is a secret gem.  </li>
<li> It has a new fragrance which is awful: a horribly sweetish chemical stink that trust me, you don&#x27;t want anywhere near your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;It controls frizz and leaves hair moisturized like the expensive salon brands without the 50 dollar price tag.&lt;br</li>
<li> That&#x27;s some bad conditioner for it to do something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Dove/Unilever changed the formula and that&#x27;s bad news.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this it is my favourite conditioner but with the small bottles here, I run out very fast. I was so delighted to be able to get these large ottles and have them delivered with no trouble at all yay!! Big thumbs p</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner.  No issues.  I think it is cheaper at local stores, but it was convenient to order online.</li>
    <li> My hair is chemically straightened. After using this product, my hair was dry and brittle. I would have been better off not using any conditioner. I&#x27;ll be throwing this out tonight!</li>
    <li> I have never written a product review on Amazon, but I HAD to for this conditioner.  Surprisingly inexpensive and accessible, this is by far the best detangling conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have curly hair, and I only wash it every 3-4 days, so as you can imagine, it gets severely tangled. It used to take me approx 15-20 minutes to run my fingers through it in the shower with old conditioner, but the dove is really amazing. It just makes my hair really silky and manageable and I love it.  I don&#x27;t know it if offers this many benefits for straight haired girls, but I highly recommend it, if for nothing else, then for its amazing detangling powers :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a secret gem.  I almost don&#x27;t want to tell people about it, it&#x27;s so good.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable and ultra conditioned.</li>
    <li> So for the past year I&#x27;ve slowly been changing my dirt-poor lifestyle to a &#x27;green&#x27; one. Which meant no-poo, SLS-free shampoo, and organic conditioners.     I have naturally thick, long beautiful hair. I had to ask a friend in high school to show me what a split end was because my hair never had split ends. When I switched my lifestyle, my hair started getting LOTS of split ends and tangled if I just looked at it, giving me a Medusa-like fashion. I was using oil treatments, detanglers, leave-in conditioners...(all within a &#x27;natural&#x27; context) but all to no avail. My scalp became sensitive from yanking on all the knots. I&#x27;d wake up in the morning and not even bother brushing my hair because of all the work just to detangle it!!    Finally I just gave in, ran to Wal-mart and bought my trusted Dove conditioner.     OH MAN!!! What a difference!! My hair is soft, COMPLETELY tangle-free, and smells delicious. Though not as shiny as it was with natural products, the difference is incredible.     As far as hair care goes, I&#x27;ll be sticking with Dove from now on.</li>
    <li> Really softens hair and works well</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner. My hair is very thick and long and most conditioners don&#x27;t really leave all of it feeling soft and pliant. This Dove conditioner absorbs through all of my hair and has really helped keep it from becoming dry and frizzy all winter.</li>
    <li> I got this conditioner because my hair is so damaged from heat and coloring that it&#x27;s full of split ends and brittle strands.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great. It makes my hair really soft. But I really haven&#x27;t noticed a change in the structure of my hair or instances of breakage, and I use it almost every day. That said, I think it works better than the run-of-the-mill conditioner in terms of softness and shine, it just doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;intensively repair\\&quot; as much as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Everyone has different hair, so shampoo and conditioners are very personal things. I have straight, shiny hair that waves when it is humid. My scalp is oily. I was very satisfied with the Dove Cool Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair is very prone to split ends, so I thought I would give this line a try. What a mistake!! This made my hair greasy, limp, and weighed down. It just felt dirty and gross. I tried it for a week and couldn&#x27;t stand it, so I gave it to my mother to try. To my surprise, the next day she was raving about this product. I thought was a complete dud, but she insisted otherwise. This is the cheapest product that she will use on her damaged, dry, color-treated hair. Usually she dishes out the cash for salon products. If she ever had to buy supermarket shampoo, she would get John Frieda and refuse anything else. If there was Bed Head, she would sometimes opt for that... but not anymore. She swears by this line now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has a very sensitive scalp, and this doesn&#x27;t bother it. The [[ASIN:B001ET7KC2 Dove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Shampoo, Cucumber/Green Tea, 25.4-Fluid Ounces (750 ml) (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B001ET7ERI Dove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Conditioner, 25.4 Ounce  (Pack of 2)]] made her scalp flakey. It also dried out her hair. But the damage therapy line does something miraculous for her hair. It smooths down her fly-aways and makes her hair look nice and straight (instead of all over the place), just the way that she likes it. After ironing, it looks even better. So on my mother&#x27;s behalf, I give this product five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: this conditioner is lump prone.</li>
    <li> For a Dove hair care product I am pleasantly surprised at how rich and thick the conditioner is. Of course I love the way it smells too. My only complaint is I find it leaves a heavy residue on my hair so in a day or so it appears greasy even though it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ve been using this every time I shower but I might limit its use to 1x/week to avoid the residue buildup it seems to create. Otherwise happy and I would buy again</li>
    <li> After a torturous morning of mowing my gigantic yard, I decided to try my sample of Dove Intense Damage Therapy Conditioner.  My long hair was full of grass, bugs, sunscreen and sweat.  A great combination of destroying elements to test the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, I use shampoo and conditioners for color-treated hair. But with all the fun of summer, comes the dryness of the sun, pool and beach. My ends tend to get a little dry, but luckily I do not suffer from too much frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After scrubbing my hair clean from the yard debris, I opened my little sample with my teeth. I don&#x27;t suggest you do that, it tastes awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner smells wonderful from the moment you open it. It is a pleasant scent, not overly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was easy to comb out after my shower. After letting it air dry, my hair is soft and the ends appear to be smooth. And it still smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use Dove Intense Damage Therapy Conditioner once or twice-a-week. I will continue to use shampoo for color-treated hair, because my red hair tends to fade fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a conditioner that smells great, eliminates frizzy ends and leaves your hair touchable, I would recommend Dove Intense Damage Therapy Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love dove hair care products.  They smell great and they always leave my hair feeling super soft and super clean.</li>
    <li> I totally ove this conditioner. Large size for A good price so I bought multiple.highly recommend this product from dove</li>
    <li> I have long (waist-length), thick hair that tends to be coarse and dry. Which means that it tends to get frizzed-out and dull. I have tried a million different conditioners, some of them very expensive. What a surprise to try a travel size of dove conditioner on a trip and discover that it works better than anything I have ever tried before. I use both the Dove Shampoo and the matching conditioner. It used to be a nightmare trying to comb my hair out after a shampoo- now the comb slides through it very quickly and tangles simply slide out. Having tried every expensive conditioner I can find, from drugstores to beauty supply stores to department stores, amazing to find a CHEAP grocery-store conditioner is what works better than anything else. My hair is shiny and it brings out my slight natural wave. People always ask me what I do to get my hair to look like it does- I don&#x27;t blow dry it, curl it, or style it in anyway, just have a good hair cut and use the Dove hair products and that brings out the best in my hair.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite hair product (both the shampoo and the conditioner) but not anymore. Dove/Unilever changed the formula and that&#x27;s bad news. It has a new fragrance which is awful: a horribly sweetish chemical stink that trust me, you don&#x27;t want anywhere near your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even worse than the stink of Dove Intensive Repair is that the conditioner no longer works as well on my hair. Right after popping open the top and smelling the chemical stink of the new formula conditioner I poured some out in my hand and immediately noticed that the conditioner had also changed in texture or viscosity. Intensive Repair used to be a wonderfully thick, creamy conditioner that clung to my wet hair and after rinsing it out left it silky smooth. No more. Now this new formula conditioner is thin and runny and leaves my hair feeling dry even when it&#x27;s wet. That&#x27;s some bad conditioner for it to do something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that on the new formula bottles there&#x27;s a little note on the front label near the top which reads \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; and \\&quot;Repairs at hair&#x27;s cellular levels\\&quot;. That&#x27;s one way that you can tell you have the awful new formula and not the great old one. So now I&#x27;m off to every drugstore and big box store that sells hair care products and buy up every bottle of the old formula because believe me, this new formula is so bad I never want to use it again.</li>
    <li> Smell very nice and the price is unbeatable.  After I used it, my hear looks very shiny and smooth.  I will recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace&lt;br /&gt;CT</li>
    <li> This conditioner is one of the best we have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It controls frizz and leaves hair moisturized like the expensive salon brands without the 50 dollar price tag.&lt;br /&gt;It does not weigh hair down and soothes the scalp and hair. I would put this conditioner right up there with Biolage the slip is the same and your hair will thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my girls and my terribly tangly hair. Smooths it out so there is minimal snagging/crying, even for my 4 year old. We have below-waist length hair. We&#x27;ll always have this on hand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, but I do condition every single day. I have hair that is long, just about to hit my natural waistline. I have also color treated my hair often, and use a flat iron and curling wand on a regular basis. After I started using this condition, my stylist was amazed. She said my hair looked and felt like virgin hair, and I didn&#x27;t need to even get a trim after months without having one, because I had no split ends at all! Pretty awesome! I shampoo twice a week, and condition every day. On the days I don use shampoo, I first get my hair all wet, I scrub my scalp with just water, I put loads of this conditioner on starting with the ends, and working my way up the hair, but avoiding the roots on the top of my head and around my part. I then take a dove bar soap and glide it over my hairline and part. I let all this soak on to my hair for the remainder of my shower and then rinse it out when is done with everything else. Most days I let my hair air-dry afterwards.</li>
