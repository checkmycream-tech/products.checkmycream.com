### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great item!</li>
      <li>Great price and great colors!</li>
      <li>and they always have great products at great prices!</li>
      <li>The colors were very nice.</li>
      <li>Nice pop of color on almond color skin!</li>
      <li>These stay on FAIRLY well but do bleed a bit when you lick your lips/</li>
      <li>These lipstains DO NOT look good at all.  </li>
      <li>You just have to keep renewing the wetness to keep your lips looking good.......</li>
      <li>Good for the price</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>but I have fallen in love with your cosmetic line!</li>
      <li>Oh and if you find that you like or already know your favorite kind of chap stick/lip gloss you can use that instead.</li>
      <li>It just comes off quite easily once I apply my lipstick!  </li>
      <li>They make great products at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The color of the tip is more the color of the stain.</li>
      <li>#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; situation because I usually love most E.l.f. products I have tried</li>
      <li>it feathered which I was sure</li>
      <li>The people I bought these for absolutely love them.</li>
      <li>I love e.l.f</li>
      <li>and I love the color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The quality actually is good for the price , totally not a waste !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cheap, but is in no way worth a penny.</li>
      <li>cos you&#x27;re cheap, like me.</li>
      <li>Try Cover Girls lip liquor, but remember that it only looks perfect when and as much as you apply the chap stick that goes with it.  </li>
      <li>stain is EXACTLY like a magic marker, and looks like it after application.</li>
      <li>looks good and does last</li>
      <li>The colors start out nice at application and the marker makes them easy to apply however as a stain it falls short.</li>
      <li>i love lipstains but when applying it is like rubbing a old marker against your lips and looks kinda watery...</li>
      <li>they make the lip kind a dry</li>
      <li>No one was able to wear the red.</li>
      <li>The pink is nice.</li>
      <li>I really want to like you,</li>
      <li>The pink is more of a summer color.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have as much of an issue with bleeding</li>
      <li>They are long lasting , I liked the colors.</li>
      <li>KoolAid mouth quickly ferments into \\&quot;wine mouth\\&quot;, giving the impression you&#x27;ve switched to the harder stuff, and that innocent manga party is totally over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve given one extra star to the cute packaging, and overall Elfin effort.</li>
      <li>When applied, it looks like you drew on your lips with marker and after the application, it complete dries your lips out.  </li>
      <li>I was so surprised.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;You are looking effin&#x27; ridiculous with this magic marker on your face, lady\\&quot;, I said to myself as I realized I&#x27;d basically Crayola&#x27;d my face, and you will,</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected when I placed my order.</li>
      <li>and although stays on they dry out fast plus</li>
      <li>Silly cartoon lips may look good to, I don&#x27;t know, Japanese Manga fetishists, or something.</li>
      <li>are yet another reason to stick with your good old fashioned lipstick, and pass on yet another disappointment from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to ruin the \\&quot;five star\\&quot; party, but it&#x27;s the truth.</li>
      <li>The tips of tge bryshes aew pretty much dried out.</li>

<li> formula is drying, and darkens in lines and dry skin mere minutes after application.</li>
<li> Not happy!</li>
<li> To me it just looks creepy, like I&#x27;ve been hitting up back-alley daycare centers for their leftover KoolAid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Stinks</li>
<li> the smell is bad. .</li>
<li> Balms are also powerless against said stain&#x27;s evil drying powers.</li>
<li> I really hated this product.  </li>
<li> Was very disappointed.</li>
<li> It is basically a marker, and feels horrible on the lips.  </li>
<li> It is the worst idea.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my lips very dry</li>
    <li> The colors start out nice at application and the marker makes them easy to apply however as a stain it falls short. It dried my lips, even wearing lip balm didn&#x27;t help. I didn&#x27;t have as much of an issue with bleeding but it does fade when in contact with liquids which would be an issue if you lick your lips. It also seemed to get darker the longer I wore it and it feathered which I was sure was something a lip stain shouldn&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; situation because I usually love most E.l.f. products I have tried but this was definitely not one of them.</li>
    <li> They are long lasting , I liked the colors. The quality actually is good for the price , totally not a waste !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes they make the lip kind a dry but all you need is to add some lip balm , I do this to all lipstains I use no matter what is the brand.</li>
    <li> i love lipstains but when applying it is like rubbing a old marker against your lips and looks kinda watery... i only gave it two stars because once done applying it looks good and does last</li>
    <li> You expect stain to stay on for an extended period of time. This is not the case for this product. It is gone within five minutes. Was very disappointed. The colors were very nice.</li>
    <li> Oh, Elf. I really want to like you, cos you&#x27;re cheap, like me. But alas, your prices really do reflect your quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stain is EXACTLY like a magic marker, and looks like it after application. Silly cartoon lips may look good to, I don&#x27;t know, Japanese Manga fetishists, or something. To me it just looks creepy, like I&#x27;ve been hitting up back-alley daycare centers for their leftover KoolAid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula is drying, and darkens in lines and dry skin mere minutes after application. KoolAid mouth quickly ferments into \\&quot;wine mouth\\&quot;, giving the impression you&#x27;ve switched to the harder stuff, and that innocent manga party is totally over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is uneven, even after exfoliation. Balms are also powerless against said stain&#x27;s evil drying powers. Sigh. \\&quot;You are looking effin&#x27; ridiculous with this magic marker on your face, lady\\&quot;, I said to myself as I realized I&#x27;d basically Crayola&#x27;d my face, and you will, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also! The stain runs when wet, so ghoulish dribbles down your chin (and on your teeth and tongue!) are yet another reason to stick with your good old fashioned lipstick, and pass on yet another disappointment from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to ruin the \\&quot;five star\\&quot; party, but it&#x27;s the truth. However, I&#x27;ve given one extra star to the cute packaging, and overall Elfin effort. (insert \\&quot;meh\\&quot; emoticon here)</li>
    <li> Great item! I recommend this to everyone! Great price and great colors! I love e.l.f. and they always have great products at great prices!</li>
    <li> After 2 or 3 uses, they dried out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I left my CoverGirl! I guess the Three Pack suckered me in. It says it lasts for hours, NO IT DOESN&#x27;T!! I use LipStains a lot, you have to let them dry before you eat, drink, ect. I let them dry, it still came off. Not happy!</li>
    <li> Even the most expensive stain looks like permanent marker, it is shaped, feels, and looks like a marker because it is a marker.It is the worst idea. It will show EVERY STINKIN LINE! Try Cover Girls lip liquor, but remember that it only looks perfect when and as much as you apply the chap stick that goes with it.  Oh and if you find that you like or already know your favorite kind of chap stick/lip gloss you can use that instead. You just have to keep renewing the wetness to keep your lips looking good....... soooo to tell you the real truth you will find the process retarded and end up going back to your favorite lipstick. Good-Luck!</li>
    <li> These lipstains DO NOT look good at all.  When applied, it looks like you drew on your lips with marker and after the application, it complete dries your lips out.  I would only recommend this as play makeup for kids.</li>
    <li> These lipstains do not budge! I was so surprised. Will buy again. The color of the tip is more the color of the stain. Nice pop of color on almond color skin!</li>
    <li> Stinks and although stays on they dry out fast plus the smell is bad. .</li>
    <li> They make great products at a very reasonable price. I have already used the red and plum. The pink is more of a summer color. Love it!</li>
    <li> These stay on FAIRLY well but do bleed a bit when you lick your lips/drink anything. I have not used the pink one or the dark red yet but I have used the cherry red and I love the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have yet to book my permanent lip liner appointment, and the dark one is the correct color I use to line my lips, but alas... It just comes off quite easily once I apply my lipstick!  No point in using it for me...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected when I placed my order. Good for the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I really hated this product.  It is basically a marker, and feels horrible on the lips.  It&#x27;s very cheap, but is in no way worth a penny.</li>
    <li> The tips of tge bryshes aew pretty much dried out. I only got about 3 uses out of each. If you have even rhe skighest of dry lips. The lip stain steetls there and make you look like your bleeding. Im a mua and i got them to use for photo shoots. No one was able to wear the red. The pink is nice.</li>
    <li> The people I bought these for absolutely love them. not only that but I have fallen in love with your cosmetic line! Thank you</li>
