      <li>wonderful for removing makeup.</li>

      <li>These are the best wipes I&#x27;ve used.</li>

      <li>Good product and great price.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love these wipes!  </li>
      <li>Love the smell!</li>
      <li>I love these wipes!  </li>
      <li>Kind of nauseating.  </li>
      <li>It works well and has a nice scent to boot.</li>
      <li>Effectively removes makeup.  </li>
      <li>I love this Aveeno product and the price is good.</li>
      <li>very easy to use, effective and unscented.  </li>
      <li>I like this one best so far.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I prefer the Calming wipes, since they are more moist.</li>
      <li>I love this cleaner.</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>The scent is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to grab and go for trips.</li>
      <li>My make-up comes off easily and my skins feels so moist afterwards that I no longer use a moisturizer before going to bed.</li>
      <li>Really strong scent that fills my bathroom</li>
      <li>I agree with others that there&#x27;s a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>I liked product very much and will buy again.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many other brands from the drug store and have never found one as good as these!</li>
      <li>It works well at first, but after a while caused my face to produce even more oil, and caused breakouts.</li>
      <li>I feel so fresh and so clean</li>
      <li>I love the way they smell and they are very moist in the package and not dried out like most face wipes.</li>
      <li>I clean my face with a washcloth first to remove some of my make-up, then use one wipe to get the rest of my make-up off and go to bed feeling clean and smelling fresh.  </li>
      <li>These are literally the BEST face wipes I have ever found, they always wipe off all my makeup without having to rub super hard and are super gentle on my eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m breaking out a little, and I&#x27;ve noticed that these wipes most likely aren&#x27;t great if you have an ongoing breakout.</li>
      <li>These handy mae-up wipes work well on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>the scent is so strong, and it&#x27;s not a scent that comes from anything natural.</li>
      <li>However, so far I am extremely satisfied with this gentle cleanser.  </li>
      <li>They gently remove dirt &amp; makeup,but moisturize after!  </li>
      <li>No weird reactions to.  </li>
      <li>but I barely notice it -- although my husband once mentioned that it smelled quite strong when I got in bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>OMG these wipes have such a strong smell that I have to wash it off immediately.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and have tried most of the competitors products.</li>
      <li>I really like these wipes.</li>
      <li>so you can control how much product you need with each usage.</li>
      <li>While this really doesn&#x27;t do much to help the planet, it assuages my guilt a</li>
      <li>I actually really like these BECAUSE of the scent.  </li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t wear much make up, then use a bottle of liquid make up remover with a cotton ball</li>
      <li>So, I end up wasting each wipe, not using much of it.</li>
      <li>do you really think I want to add pimples to the mix of things I need to address?&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes my life so much easier.  </li>
      <li>Very very pleased with these, and when it comes to face wipes I&#x27;d say it is very hard to do.  </li>
      <li>leaves skin very soft.</li>
      <li>( I only began to use a make-up remover because I started wearing more make-up due to my rosacea.)</li>
      <li>First of all, I&#x27;m writing this after using the product for only two months</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t work, they just smell LOUD.</li>
      <li>Even my daughter uses them, &amp; has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Because I have rosacea, I need a product that will not irritate my skin, and so far I have had no issues with the Aveeno exacerbating any redness or skin eruptions.</li>
      <li>If you wear a lot of make up on your eyes and stuff like foundations and powders on your face, then this would probably suit you, you would probably use each wipe completely.</li>
      <li>These remove makeup and leave your skin soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this Aveeno product and the price is good.</li>
    <li> Really strong scent that fills my bathroom and this is a problem for me. I don&#x27;t like my bathroom/house smelling like fake fragrance. It raises concern for me, being that I&#x27;m putting this stuff on my face and the scent is so strong, and it&#x27;s not a scent that comes from anything natural. I feel like I&#x27;m smearing febreze or glade all over my face, eyes and all over my bathroom. Kind of nauseating.  If you don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up do not get these, it&#x27;s a waste. The cloths/wipes are big and I usually only need like a corner of one single wipe but then I&#x27;m standing there wondering if it&#x27;s not hygienic to put it back into the packet to use the rest of the wipe another time. Seriously, I could re-use one wipe for an entire week. So, I end up wasting each wipe, not using much of it. If you wear a lot of make up on your eyes and stuff like foundations and powders on your face, then this would probably suit you, you would probably use each wipe completely. But if you don&#x27;t wear much make up, then use a bottle of liquid make up remover with a cotton ball so you can control how much product you need with each usage.</li>
    <li> The scent on these wipes was overpowering and I could not use them.  I ended up giving them away for a teenager to use.  Very disappointing for me</li>
    <li> I love this cleaner. Not only does it take my foundation makeup off it takes off all the black on my eyes. I love it...</li>
    <li> OMG these wipes have such a strong smell that I have to wash it off immediately.  I can&#x27;t believe that I have to get through six packages of them!  Never again.  It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t work, they just smell LOUD.</li>
    <li> Product is as described but the product makes my face break out. It works well at first, but after a while caused my face to produce even more oil, and caused breakouts. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love these wipes!  They gently remove dirt &amp; makeup,but moisturize after!  I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> If I&#x27;m buying a product that deals with the ravages of ageing.....wrinkles and age spots....do you really think I want to add pimples to the mix of things I need to address?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No....I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes made my face break out even if I washed my face shortly after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They leave a film on your face....weird for a product that says &amp;#34;no rinsing necessary&amp;#34;.  I agree with others that there&#x27;s a strong smell.  But the pimples were a deal breaker.  Into the trash....</li>
    <li> Love the smell! I feel so fresh and so clean</li>
    <li> Makes my life so much easier.  Hopefully  I will never run out again.</li>
    <li> The scent is overwhelming. I have used two and will get rid of the rest.</li>
    <li> Effectively removes makeup.  No weird reactions to.  Even my daughter uses them, &amp; has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These are literally the BEST face wipes I have ever found, they always wipe off all my makeup without having to rub super hard and are super gentle on my eyes. I love the way they smell and they are very moist in the package and not dried out like most face wipes. I have tried so many other brands from the drug store and have never found one as good as these! Not greasy what so ever and I never have skin issues, don&#x27;t even wash my face and just use these and my skin is flawless!</li>
    <li> I love these wipes!  I don&#x27;t find the scent overpowering.  I actually really like these BECAUSE of the scent.  I clean my face with a washcloth first to remove some of my make-up, then use one wipe to get the rest of my make-up off and go to bed feeling clean and smelling fresh.  These are the best wipes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I only wear sunscreen and very little Cc cream but these wipes burn my face skin so bad. 😭😭😭So bad.....like on fire. It does do the job though.</li>
    <li> These handy mae-up wipes work well on my dry skin. It is so easy to grab and go for trips.</li>
    <li> very easy to use, effective and unscented.  leaves skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It works well and has a nice scent to boot.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m writing this after using the product for only two months so my outlook may change.  However, so far I am extremely satisfied with this gentle cleanser.  My make-up comes off easily and my skins feels so moist afterwards that I no longer use a moisturizer before going to bed. Because I have rosacea, I need a product that will not irritate my skin, and so far I have had no issues with the Aveeno exacerbating any redness or skin eruptions. Others have complained about the odor but I barely notice it -- although my husband once mentioned that it smelled quite strong when I got in bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one who formerly only used a washcloth and soap to remove make-up, I felt a bit guilty about creating more unnecessary garbage with the wipes. ( I only began to use a make-up remover because I started wearing more make-up due to my rosacea.) To mitigate the waste problem I re-use each wipe twice by briefly wiping off my face with a wet washcloth first, and then using the Aveeno product.  I store the used wipe in a separate plastic baggie and throw it away after the second use.  While this really doesn&#x27;t do much to help the planet, it assuages my guilt a bit.&lt;br /&gt; my guilt a little bit.</li>
    <li> Surprised to read previous reviews. I liked product very much and will buy again. I have very dry skin and have tried most of the competitors products. I like this one best so far.</li>
    <li> I really like these wipes. I use them every night to take my make up off. However, I&#x27;m breaking out a little, and I&#x27;ve noticed that these wipes most likely aren&#x27;t great if you have an ongoing breakout. I&#x27;m not sure if they make the breakout worse, or if they just keep your breakout in limbo.. but I feel it&#x27;s somewhere in the middle with me.</li>
    <li> These remove makeup and leave your skin soft. I don&#x27;t understand how this got a low rating. I love them.</li>
    <li> wonderful for removing makeup.</li>
    <li> Good product and great price.  I prefer the Calming wipes, since they are more moist. But this is a great product.  Drier than I like.</li>
    <li> Very very pleased with these, and when it comes to face wipes I&#x27;d say it is very hard to do.  My number one pick is typically Garnier Fructis but these are definitely just as satisfactory.  I will repurchase without a doubt.</li>
    <li> This product stings my eyes!</li>
