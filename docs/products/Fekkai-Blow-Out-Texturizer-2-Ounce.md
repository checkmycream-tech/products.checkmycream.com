### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am really impressed.  </li>
      <li>The blowout went great!  </li>
      <li>I could get days out of it and my hair would look perfect.  </li>
      <li>I am really impressed.  </li>
      <li>It cleaned out of my hair incredibly easily.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
      <li>It blows out beautifully, but falls within an hour or two.</li>
      <li>I eventually found a really good hair spray in another brand, but I held a bit of a grudge against Fekkai, because it used to still be the best I had ever used before they changed it on</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or crunchy, and had a great smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(this is the one-star deduction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a great product.</li>
      <li>It also smells very good; a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>but oh my goodness does my hair smell amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving this!</li>
      <li>The best way for myself to describe this would be a love child between running water and hair gel.  </li>

      <li>If I don&#x27;t use a good shampoo that will give me volume, I look like I have almost no hair.  </li>
      <li>and I am very pleased with the volume, as well as the body that it imparted.  </li>
      <li>The product smells VERY nice; a fruity note that is not too strong but pleasant.</li>

      <li>liked this Texturizer and will use it again.  </li>
      <li>and I liked the fact that it wasn&#x27;t sticky to touch or leave a film on my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are some really nice positives:&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
      <li>I find you also have to use a good amount of this product for better results.  </li>
      <li>Its very easy to use and does not leave a greasy, weighted look to your hair.</li>
      <li>It went on very lightly</li>
      <li>Using the product was extremely easy, it went on without a hitch, smelled nice, and I could see a noticeable difference in volume after blow drying my hair.</li>
      <li>While it smells nice and is easy to use, the result was indistinguishable from using no product at all.</li>
      <li>This is a light and pleasantly scented product that is supposedly used at the roots and distributed to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Having used everything of this nature available for volume, I basically just applied this at the roots concentrating the product there.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes my weanie baby fine hair look AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>If your hair has more texture/body than that, I think your results might differ dramatically.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When all was said and done, I was pleased with the lift and body</li>
      <li>but my hair does look better when using than product than if I don&#x27;t use any products at all when blow-drying.</li>
      <li>LOVE the ocean type scent</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the ease of application and</li>
      <li>my hair more structured.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product really works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>They had my ultimate perfect hair spray that I and many friends used all of the time.  </li>
      <li>This is okay.  </li>
      <li>I put my finger tips at the roots and applied to the sides and top of my head.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or anything, it dries great and keeps my hair looking good all day long.</li>
      <li>In terms of volume, the results were limited at best, but it was still better than nothing.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m thinking this product might be better for those with fine hair)</li>
      <li>That puts this texturizer just below the top product that I have ever found to add volume to baby fine hair (referring to Powder Play).  </li>

      <li>It washes out easily too.  </li>
      <li>It washes out easily too.  </li>
      <li>It smells great and wasn&#x27;t greasy, which is a huge plus, my hair can look greasy quickly with too much product.</li>
      <li>This was an easy addition to my hair care routine.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that can be flyaway.  </li>
      <li>This seemed to be the perfect little addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sadly,  I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement in the volume of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t see how that is really done.  </li>
      <li>When using my straightening iron, I could HEAR the sound of something on my hair, an added friction.  </li>
      <li>So...despite those existing conditions I did notice some extra shine and floof to my hair, and my bangs let me do what I wanted them to do &#x3D; happy customer.</li>
      <li>I was happy to try this product, but it really didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
      <li>When applied to the hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling, but feels clean and light.  </li>
      <li>I love Fekkai  products and this one worked fairly well on my long thicker hair.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it will help keep volume throughout the day when the hot humid days of summer get here :)</li>
      <li>I have never used a texturizer before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how it worked.</li>
      <li>True confessions time:  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very beachy which I love.  </li>
      <li>Certainly not a bad product, depending on your hair type and style.  </li>
      <li>But it does provide a pleasant scent, provides some lift to my hair and isn’t sticky once dry.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am scent sensitive, so although this one may not seem too strong to some, it is too strong a scent for me</li>
      <li>Along with the right shampoo, this stuff adds an amazing dimension to hair that is usually flat and fine.  </li>
      <li>Along with the right shampoo, this stuff adds an amazing dimension to hair that is usually flat and fine.  </li>
      <li>I recently received this product and have been using it for a couple weeks now - I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a bit more volume and blow dry your hair regularly, this is a great product to try.</li>
      <li>This happens to me on rare occasions, that something triggers a headache.</li>
      <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>It washes out easily without leaving any type of residue or flakes, and smells decent.</li>
      <li>I did receive these products for complimentary testing purposes in all review materials.</li>
      <li>The tube is only 2 ounces!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to apply it before blow drying, which is the only reason I chose to review this product, because truthfully I don&#x27;t need one more hair on my head!  </li>
      <li>This is a tiny little bottle it does smell great:}</li>
      <li>I would say this almost takes my hair to the level that the Big and Sexy Powder Play takes my hair</li>

      <li>This product does exactly what it promises.  </li>
      <li>My hair was smooth, soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>It gave it just enough body and tamed most of my flyaways.</li>
      <li>I just followed the instructions and it totally lifted my fine and super straight hair!</li>
      <li>I guess the key to getting good results from the Fekkai Blowout is to use A LOT of it: a big, fat quarter size dollop.  </li>
      <li>This could be because my hair is also long and this would probably work better on shorter</li>
      <li>I have baby fine, super straight, grey hair.</li>
      <li>So only planning to use it on special occasions as of now!</li>
      <li>I use it a maximum of 5 minutes, but never in the Summer, when most times I just air dry my hair.  </li>
      <li>It’s also easy to comb out, which is a big plus.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is gel based and clear with a mild fragrance.  </li>
      <li>No dramatic increase in volume.</li>
      <li>My hair did remain somewhat soft with this blowout texturizer, but it was kind of dry and fuzzy feeling.  </li>
      <li>While the manufacturer recommended a product that I suspect sets the end result, I thought it worked very well without</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product lives up to the hype.  I have very thin hair and I am very pleased with the volume, as well as the body that it imparted.  I was worried that it would weigh my hair down, but there was no build up feel that some products can give.  It also smells very good; a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Got it from influenster as a sample.I was totally blank on how to use it or what to expect! I just followed the instructions and it totally lifted my fine and super straight hair! It gave body to my hair, which most of the time my hair fail to get from many products, used some before, but they were harsh for me and damaged my hair a lot. Since then I am not using much of styling products, but with this product I might get styles which my hair can hold for longer period of time, so yet to try that.&lt;br /&gt;But, I did not like the fact that after some hours my hair feel coarse and thats a turn off. So only planning to use it on special occasions as of now!</li>
    <li> I have thick, thick hair with a tendency towards waviness.  It blows out beautifully, but falls within an hour or two. So about a week or two ago I bought Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s volume blow out gel to try. It worked well, but brushing my hair later felt like I was pulling through tangles.  It wasn&#x27;t bad stuff, just harder to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, is essentially the same, and I like it better. Simply because after the blowout and the hairspray, a few hours later I still have volume AND I can brush through it to reshape.  It freshens up and shapes my hair to as if I just got the hair blown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, and only a little is needed for shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> The Fekkai Blow out Texturizer is a good, but not great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some really nice positives:&lt;br /&gt;-- It cleaned out of my hair incredibly easily.&lt;br /&gt;-- It didn&#x27;t leave any leftover residue on my straightener&lt;br /&gt;-- It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-- and it has a really nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly,  I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement in the volume of my hair.  There was a small amount, but not really enough to be that noteworthy, and especially not at the $20 MSRP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s not the end all solution to hair blow outs.</li>
    <li> I can see why this product is for people who are trying to add volume to their hair.  The tube is only 2 ounces!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to apply it before blow drying, which is the only reason I chose to review this product, because truthfully I don&#x27;t need one more hair on my head!  I&#x27;ve always had thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However my hair does need protection against the heat of my blow dryer, even tho I use it a maximum of 5 minutes, but never in the Summer, when most times I just air dry my hair.  It would take forever in cooler weather to totally dry my hair, which isn&#x27;t a problem in hotter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this product does help protect your hair from blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the ocean type scent, it&#x27;s very beachy which I love.  Not overwhelming either, like some products the scent can be too strong, but this scent isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> After shampooing my hair the other day I applied this Fekkai Blow Out Texurizer to my roots and set off to blow drying my hair in the usual manner.  I was pleased with the ease of application and the gel isn&#x27;t sticky or hard to distribute through my thick hair.  I use a round brush to straighten my hair and noticed a slight bit of tug, to the root area where the gel had been applied, when I pulled the brush through.  Not a big deal but made me notice that something was definitely at work on my roots to give them some body and lift.  When all was said and done, I was pleased with the lift and body my roots had... more so then normal from my other products.  Not sure if the product comes in a larger size but the 2oz tube will be perfect size for my travels.</li>
    <li> My wife has thin, straight, medium-length hair without a lot of volume. When using this product it seemed to give more volume, but nothing dramatic. You could wish for a little more volume. When applied to the hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling, but feels clean and light.  And despite the fact it gives a little volume it doesn&#x27;t give you that dry frizzy hair look. It feels normal, healthy and slightly lifted (when using a blow dryer and drying with head bent  down). The product smells VERY nice; a fruity note that is not too strong but pleasant. After using this product at home you feel like you&#x27;ve just walked out of the salon! By comparison, my wife has also used Fekkai&#x27;s &amp;#34;Full Blown Volume Lightweight Styling Whip&amp;#34;, and prefers this texturizer for the way it leaves your hair feeling cleaner, as well as the scent.</li>
    <li> I use all Fekkai products and was interest in trying out this texturizer as a I have fine hair that can be flyaway.  I also have some thick coarse white hairs mixed in which can be quite ugly sticking out from my hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions didn&#x27;t say how much to apply so I was cautious applying this, and ended up adding a little more halfway through.  I was a little put off by the gummy texture on my hands but my hair wasn&#x27;t gummy.  The blowout went great!  My hair was smooth, soft and shiny.  The white hairs stuck out a little but calmed down quickly with a little Fekkai PRX oil which I usually add anyway.  I thought it did add some needed texture and when my hair was dry I put just a little on the ends and it helped to make my hair more structured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this Texturizer and will use it again.  Fekkai recommends using their blow-out sealer after this--wonder how that would look?</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair less stiff and coated than any other gel or mousse I&#x27;ve tried and provides good body.  It is easy to apply. For my hair (generally about 5 inches length) I use about a half teaspoon on damp hair, concentrating on roots then spreading it.  I&#x27;m guessing this 2 ounce tube would last me 3 to 4 weeks.  Not real cheap, but the stuff from the salons is more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The smell I like - reminds me of some products from the salon, not flowery.&lt;br /&gt; The body lasts 24 hours for me. I dry with a diffuser to maximize waves and this works for me.  Will probably keep buying this.</li>
    <li> This is a light and pleasantly scented product that is supposedly used at the roots and distributed to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Having used everything of this nature available for volume, I basically just applied this at the roots concentrating the product there. I followed that up with blow drying on a cool setting, my head turned upside down. It worked like a charm. My silky straight hair was fuller  and loaded with volume as promised without being either ultra sticky or glue like. While the manufacturer recommended a product that I suspect sets the end result, I thought it worked very well without it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would prohibit me from using this product on an ongoing basis is the cost. This tube holds 2 oz and costs $18. While nice, I already use a salon product that essentially delivers the same results for less.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer:  I have REALLY fine, REALLY straight hair, so straight that heated rollers or iron give it a slight wave for about 5 minutes, less if it is humid.  If your hair has more texture/body than that, I think your results might differ dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product per directions, applying following towel-drying and without any other post-shower product.  It went on very lightly and I had high hopes, but, following the blow dry, my hair was just as flat and limp as usual, despite every blow dry trick I know to try to give it some lift.  When using my straightening iron, I could HEAR the sound of something on my hair, an added friction.  However, may hair didn&#x27;t look any different, and the one good thing about my hair, the silky, cold feel when you slip your hand through it, was gone.  So this did nothing for me, but I think if you had something to work with, it might.</li>
    <li> When I opened the shipping box I was startled at the tiny size of the Fekkai Blowout bottle.  It almost looked like a sample or travel size.  Given the price and the tiny size I figured the product must be super concentrated, so the first time I used just a tiny dab. (Note that the directions do not tell you how much to use.) After blow drying my hair I didn&#x27;t notice any increase in volume.  None.  My hair is shoulder length, and it is very thin, very limp, and has a tendency to curl.  After “styling” it looked just as limp and flat as if I had used nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I re-wet my hair, and the second time I applied a big dollop of the Fekkai Blowout product.  After styling my hair did looked a bit fuller and fluffier; it was also very soft, fresh smelling, and didn’t have that crunchy feel that my normal mousse gives my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess the key to getting good results from the Fekkai Blowout is to use A LOT of it: a big, fat quarter size dollop.  But given the size of the bottle, and the frequency that I wash my hair, I would have to buy this stuff by the case.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It really helps add volume to my hair during blow drying. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, at all, but keeps it soft.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin, straight, hair with some gray in it.  I was happy to try this product, but it really didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  It still seemed limp. After a couple of hours, I dampened my hair a little and applied some [[ASIN:B002RT4S1E Brocato Blonde Swell Fat Hair Cream (4 oz)]].  I started using Brocato&#x27;s Fat Hair Cream after my hairdresser recommended it, and will continue to use it.  The Fekkai Texturizer is also more expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few Fekkai products and have had very positive experiences, most recently with a creme for coarse hair, so I had high expectations prior to using this texturizer. I feel like I&#x27;m one of the few men in the world who will actually admit to blow drying his hair, so I was definitely up for trying to add some texture to my hair before blow drying. Using the product was extremely easy, it went on without a hitch, smelled nice, and I could see a noticeable difference in volume after blow drying my hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week or so and have gotten some nice compliments with a few people asking me if I had done something new with my hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a bit more volume and blow dry your hair regularly, this is a great product to try.</li>
    <li> True confessions time:  I have been mad at Fekkai brand for a while now.  They had my ultimate perfect hair spray that I and many friends used all of the time.  I could get days out of it and my hair would look perfect.  Then the formula changed and it stopped working.  That left me without a hair spray that worked on my impossibly baby fine hair.  I eventually found a really good hair spray in another brand, but I held a bit of a grudge against Fekkai, because it used to still be the best I had ever used before they changed it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had the opportunity to try out this blow out texturizer, I was determined to hate it.  After all, since that happened with the Fekkai hair spray, surely the other products were sub-standard now too, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did it to me again.  Fekkai brand made my hair do things that I wished for all my life.  This stuff makes my weanie baby fine hair look AMAZING.  It also lasts through sleeping on it too.  I just fluff it back up and Voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DID I USE THIS?&lt;br /&gt;My hair is tapered/layered and goes down to my shoulder blades, so it is pretty long.  When I put my hair in a pony tail, it is the size of a pencil- seriously.  If I don&#x27;t use a good shampoo that will give me volume, I look like I have almost no hair.  Because blow drying tends to make my hair worse, I have to let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my usual TIGI Superstar shampoo (which normally requires a mousse to keep the volume) and I left the mousse out.  When my hair was damp, I literally took a lentil sized drop of this clear gel and I rubbed my finger tips together gently to distribute product.  I put my finger tips at the roots and applied to the sides and top of my head.  I repeated the process for the back and crown of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used my fingers to work the product back up from the roots to the rest of my hair- not reapplying, but using what I applied at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DID THIS AFFECT MY HAIR?&lt;br /&gt;O.M.G.  I am serious.  I could not believe with AIR DRYING how this stuff took my hair and made it my dream hair- just like the hair spray used to.  It does not add waves to it per se, but it does inflate the volume to the Nth degree.  WOW.  My hair is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray it with Big Sexy Hair Spray and Play Harder and I can have my hair look the same level of fantastic for three days in a row.  I don&#x27;t experience greasiness or weight on my hair.  It also does not feel all silicone-ish like I thought it would from the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;Although this is expensive, for baby fine hair, a little goes a LONG way.  I get a lot of mileage out of one application and that makes me love this product despite my resolution to hate it.  I am really impressed.  Along with the right shampoo, this stuff adds an amazing dimension to hair that is usually flat and fine.  It washes out easily too.  I would say this almost takes my hair to the level that the Big and Sexy Powder Play takes my hair to- but not quite.  That puts this texturizer just below the top product that I have ever found to add volume to baby fine hair (referring to Powder Play).  This one by Fekkai is better in that it does not feel stiff, sticky, or like you want to wash it out.  FIVE GLOWING STARS.br /&gt;O.M.G.  I am serious.

    <li> Fekkai Blow Out Texturizer is simple to use.  I just put a small amount (dime size or less for my just below shoulder length hair) in my hair after towel drying it.  I didn&#x27;t worry about starting at the roots and combing out to the ends (as per directions).  I honestly don&#x27;t see how that is really done.  I just smeared both hands together and then ran my hands through all of my hair.  I then used a wide toothed comb to comb it through.  This is how I normally put on my styling product.  I do not like my hair to be stiff, crunchy, funky feeling, etc.  My hair did remain somewhat soft with this blowout texturizer, but it was kind of dry and fuzzy feeling.  It doesn&#x27;t really LOOK like that (maybe  a little bit), but it definitely feels like it.  I guess that is the part that gives it volume.  It definitely does give volume to my normally flattish hair.  I did have to put a little extra product in my hair after styling it because I don&#x27;t like the dry appearance (I use Tigi Catwalk Sleek Mystique Blow Out Balm as kind of an oil or shine enhancer before the final step of using hair spray. Using about half an extra pump was enough to correct the slightly dry appearance.  I also normally use the Tigi product before drying my hair  but haven&#x27;t since using the Fekkai blow out texturizer.  I think  I may try using a little of both next time.  Maybe that will still give the lift and volume of the Fekkai product and also the softness, detangling,  and shine of the Tigi product.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product and have been using it for a couple weeks now - I absolutely love it! I have super straight hair so typically don&#x27;t put anything in it when blowdrying, however, I feel like this is something I&#x27;ll always use. It gave it just enough body and tamed most of my flyaways. Additionally, I have pretty oily hair so am skeptical about putting in any extra products. This doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or anything, it dries great and keeps my hair looking good all day long. I would definitely recommend this product to people with all hair types.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.  I have fine, thin hair.  This gives me a look and feel of thick hair, yet is is soft, light and bouncy.  I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair so am always happy to try texturizing or volumizing products. Unfortunately, this product did neither for me. While it smells nice and is easy to use, the result was indistinguishable from using no product at all. I get much better results with other, less expensive blow out products.</li>
    <li> It does what it is designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am scent sensitive, so although this one may not seem too strong to some, it is too strong a scent for me (this is the one-star deduction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a great product.</li>
    <li> According to my wife, this product added some body and loft where she wanted it.  She says the effect wasn&#x27;t earth shaking, but noticeable.  I find that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so give it a try.  It may be just what you are looking for.  With the relatively high price, it&#x27;s doubtful whether she will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality product and smells terrific.  I have always had a ton of baby fine hair, but, after menopause, it started to thin out.  I really missed the volume.  This product really helps to bring that volume back.  Its very easy to use and does not leave a greasy, weighted look to your hair.</li>
    <li> My wife has very thin hair (and I have thinning, almost non-existent hair, so I left this one up to her) - and wasn&#x27;t very happy with this. She&#x27;s done some double blind tests with this and her normal products, asking me each day to provide feedback on how it looked. Turns out, this blow out texturizer has absolutely no impact on anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Works well to smooth her hair and make it less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;- Provides a normal amount of volume. It&#x27;s acceptable, not blowout level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- No dramatic increase in volume. Not much at all, really.&lt;br /&gt;- It takes a lot of product to do anything. At $7 an ounce, that&#x27;s a very pricy proposition.</li>
    <li> Certainly not a bad product, depending on your hair type and style.  The best way for myself to describe this would be a love child between running water and hair gel.  Hair gels tend to be &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; at times and give you too much of a wet look sometimes and water by itself is not always good to phase your hair, so this fits in between of those two common elements.  Fragrance is very fresh-smelling.  The hands don&#x27;t feel too greasy, but you&#x27;d probably still need to rinse your hands.  In terms of volume, the results were limited at best, but it was still better than nothing.  By using it about 3 times a week, it lasted me about a month.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product.  I have very thick hair already so I wouldn&#x27;t typically use a texturizer but since I had a sample I gave it a try.  This is okay.  I felt like it didn&#x27;t make much difference in my hair but that could be because I have such thick hair and don&#x27;t need more body.  This could work well for people with thinner hair.</li>
    <li> I have never used a texturizer before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how it worked. The directions on the back of the package were very self-explanatory and after using it I noticed my normally limp hair had some lift at the roots. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or crunchy, and had a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I did receive these products for complimentary testing purposes in all review materials.</li>
    <li> This was an easy addition to my hair care routine. I have fine, straight hair that usually looks pretty limp. After towel drying hair, I put a little of this in before blow drying and I think it made a difference in volume! It seemed to last all day. It smells great and wasn&#x27;t greasy, which is a huge plus, my hair can look greasy quickly with too much product. This seemed to be the perfect little addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Fekkai fan, and the Blow Out Texturizer I just added to my &#x27;must have&#x27; list. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s not super thick. Too much weight to calm the frizz makes it collapse like a black hole. The Blow Out Texturizer gives just enough silkiness to calm the frizzies without weighing hair down. I feel like I have a third again as much hair, it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention the scent? Heaven! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> As a fan of Fekkai products, I have to say that while I was not disappointed with this texturizer, I was not wowed either, and for $18 a small tube it really has to wow me for me to give it a 5-star rating. It is a good product that does what it promises- adds texture and volume to hair. It washes out easily without leaving any type of residue or flakes, and smells decent.</li>
    <li> My main reason for not liking this texturizer is I cannot handle the scent. It is really potent and the closed brand new container sitting on my bathroom counter scented the air there and in the adjoining room. I cannot name parts of the scent, it is a combination blend and really perfume-like. I note the product does not name the scent so I can&#x27;t know if other products by Fekkai are this same scent. Perhaps this is their signature scent? Anyhow it gave me a brutal headache. This happens to me on rare occasions, that something triggers a headache. In my line of work I use fragrance oils and essential oils and scent at high scent levels so not everything bothers me. If the scent is a good one I am happy to have it at a strong level.  However to have my hair eminating scent as if I were a room deodorizer is not a good thing. I&#x27;m in the camp of thinking that scent in our hair, body or perfume products should not be detected beyond the arm&#x27;s length &amp;#34;scent circle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just cannot use this. I rate it 2 stars &#x3D; I Don&#x27;t Like It.</li>
    <li> I love Fekkai  products and this one worked fairly well on my long thicker hair.  I didn&#x27;t get the volume that I thought I would, but I am use to that with the length and texture of my hair.  It is gel based and clear with a mild fragrance.  I put it on after towel drying my hair and then blow dried it.  It did add some lift to the roots and I liked the fact that it wasn&#x27;t sticky to touch or leave a film on my hair. It combs through easily and might give shorter, less thick hair more volume.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it promises.  It gave my thinning hair the volume I needed.  My only reservation is that normally I wash my hair only twice a week but with this product I felt it needed more frequent washing.  A small price to pay for the look of fuller hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and fine so this added some body, but it doesn’t last as long as I would like.  Usually my hair is great the first day, but some of the lift is gone the second day.  This could be because my hair is also long and this would probably work better on shorter styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not used to using any gel type products on my hair because I find them messy and hard to distribute, even in my thin hair.  I find you also have to use a good amount of this product for better results.  But it does provide a pleasant scent, provides some lift to my hair and isn’t sticky once dry.  It’s also easy to comb out, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this will be a bit pricey for my budget because it requires washing your hair more often than I usually do it, so you can apply this volumnizer.</li>
    <li> Great product really works. Keeps hair intact for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine, super straight, grey hair. Saying this product changed everything is not overstating the facts. Suddenly my hair has body, holds it&#x27;s simple style, and does not end up plastered to my head by the end of the day. I&#x27;m loving this!</li>
    <li> A little volume, but let my hair looking greasy:{  I love a little volume in the back of my hair and have used tons of products. This I put on just my crown and the next day just my crown looked and felt greasy. This I want to avoid at all costs. This is a tiny little bottle it does smell great:}</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on fussing with hair dryer and gels and whatnot (no one sees me except my coworkers and I&#x27;m not getting up an extra half hour just to style my hair for them). My bangs are a bear to control because of a cowlick, so it&#x27;s always a good sign if a product lets me make them do what I want them to do, and this product did. I&#x27;ve used this for several days now, and I do notice some fluffiness and shine to my 1) very thin and fine hair and 2) mostly gray at the scalp at the moment &#x3D; coarser texture. So...despite those existing conditions I did notice some extra shine and floof to my hair, and my bangs let me do what I wanted them to do &#x3D; happy customer. There is a slight scent to the product that may be an issue for the more sensitive consumers (like me), but it did dissipate fairly quickly and I didn&#x27;t find it a problem. The price point for this is a bit high for my wallet, but as always, YMMV.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve seen any additional texture or volume but oh my goodness does my hair smell amazing! I typically use Chi Silk Infusion when blow-drying and straightening my hair. Chi Silk Infusion also has a lovely scent but this Blow Out Texturizer just smells heavenly! I&#x27;ll probably use this when I&#x27;m blow-drying but not straightening my hair. Like I said I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional texture or volume (however, my hair is pretty thick to begin with so I&#x27;m thinking this product might be better for those with fine hair) but my hair does look better when using than product than if I don&#x27;t use any products at all when blow-drying. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will continue to use it. Maybe it will help keep volume throughout the day when the hot humid days of summer get here :)</li>
