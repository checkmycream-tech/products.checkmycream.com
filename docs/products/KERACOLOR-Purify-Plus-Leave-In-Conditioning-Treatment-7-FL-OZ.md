    <li> Ah-maze-ing!! I have a bottle in my bathroom and my gym bag, can&#x27;t shower without it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I think my hair is so healthy because of it! We have a lot of chlorine in our water and this neutralizes it. The first time I bought it was at a hair show and the did an experiment to show me how it neutralizes it. Only small issue is its thick so you have to shake well everytime or you will have to add liquid towards the end.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my beautician.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product it has leaped my hair tremendously and fast delivery as well;)</li>

    <li> Great for thicker hair.  Mine gets dry on the outside and this conditioner helps make it look healthier and flatter.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect the hair color.  A friend who is a stylist told me to try it and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
    <li> Our hairdresser just tried this on my 5-year-old, who loves to spend hours in the pool. Instantly, her hair went from brassy blonde to soft blonde with brown highlights (what I&#x27;d imagine her natural color is). It was fairly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This is just our first use so I&#x27;ll have to see how it works over a longer period of time. At first glance, though, it seems good. I&#x27;m going to buy some now to keep at home.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have Red hair (dyed) and well water, really bad combination.  Though we have two units to soften and clarify our water my hair fades fast and there is usually no shine.  My hairdresser found this product and asked me to try it.  OMGoodness it is fantastic.  I have only been using it for a little less than a week, my color is still beautiful and the best part my hair is so soft and shiny.  This product is worth its weight in gold in my book.  Spreading the word!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My stylist recommended this several months ago and I&#x27;m so glad I took her advice.  It makes my hair so soft and love the scent.  Just a couple of squirts on my hair is all that is needed-don&#x27;t overdo it or you will have droopy hair.  Decent price too.</li>
    <li> I have heavy iron in my water (which actually stains my hair a rust-color).  This product has done an excellent job of removing the deposits before they turn my blonde locks to red. It also is very nourishing and has improved the condition of my fine hair. I&#x27;m so much happier, and my stylist is, too!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have well water that makes my hair dry and frizzy. Now my hair is soft, shiny, tangle free and smells great.</li>
    <li> Works OK.  My stylist swears by it-but i just realized that the &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; i attributed to my colour treatments was actually this.  Will use this bottle, but never buy again.  (I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents, so this may be a non-issue for most people)</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome and leaves my hair very soft and no frizzies!  I towel dry my hair first and then apply and comb through</li>
    <li> I do not color my hair but did want something to help with the harsh chemicals in our tap water. The smell is ok. Not strong, not terrible. Can leave hair feeling kinda stiff. I probably will not order again.</li>
    <li> Love this leave-in conditioning treatment!</li>
