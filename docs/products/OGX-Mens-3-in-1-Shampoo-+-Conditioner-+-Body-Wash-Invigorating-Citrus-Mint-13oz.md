### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Organix products are great!  </li>
      <li>Perfect for the guys!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Smells great in bottle, but does not leave that fragrant scent on body.</li>
      <li>Great smell and all in one bottle.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my son to have in his college dorm - to save space, smell great, etc.  </li>
      <li>Have a great hair day!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells great (according to both of us) and isn&#x27;t \\&quot;girly\\&quot; (according to him).</li>
      <li>It is great for your hair and has a good minty smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the combo is not as good as the separate shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Good price for product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will say this, the mint and tee tree oil is not tingly on the scalp like some good salon shampoos.</li>
      <li>I have been using Organix for a good while because it is the healthiest shampoo and conditioner you can buy for 5 bucks</li>
      <li>Bought this as a gift he loved it</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s great to know I can order it here :)</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It smells great, made him feel clean, and didn&#x27;t cause him to break out (which sometimes is a problem for him).</li>
      <li>This 3 in 1 product is great for a swimmer to have in their swim team backpack for a quick shower after practice.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and I love the way it makes him smell.</li>
      <li>I love this body wash.  </li>
      <li>I love everything about the organix line.</li>
      <li>Love the smell</li>
      <li>they love it.</li>
      <li>Very clean and manly.</li>
      <li>I look forward to using this every morning, it smells kind of sweet and citrusy.</li>
      <li>Hope I am able to help someone out there who needs gluten free items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I only knocked one star off for not listing this ingredient because it really is a great product.</li>
      <li>and I feel clean but not</li>
      <li>Clean citrus smell and has no residue</li>
      <li>However, the tingle does not mean it&#x27;s a better clean.</li>
      <li>The normal Citrus Mint Shampoo lists the \\&quot;hydrolyzed wheat protein\\&quot; in the ingredients but the Organix website states that that line of products are not gluten free.</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo/wash with mild scent, although don&#x27;t expect that &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; sensation on your scalp, that some other mint shampoos provide.</li>
      <li>Great product overall however, and only gets 3 stars because of the price.</li>
      <li>the 3 in 1 IS gluten free after all, just not the other products in the Citrus Mint line. :-)</li>
      <li>but I like to have the clean fresh smell that still is masculine.</li>
      <li>He really likes it!</li>
      <li>It just cost a pretty bill.</li>
      <li>buy again  thanks !</li>
      <li>This is the first product we have found for men that has conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>Much better price than the only other sulfate free 3 in 1 that we have found for men; price is important since he uses a generous amount each day.</li>
      <li>Husband loves it and the scent - he is very sensitive to &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; and this one is just right.</li>
      <li>bought this to try out and realized that I paid way too much for it through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Smell is neutral not over powering or too much</li>
      <li>I genuinely appreciate the convenience of a 3-in-1, especially at the gym.</li>
      <li>just received a few more emails from Organix which brings my rating from a 4 star to a 5 star, they made a mistake with the information provided in the first email.</li>
      <li>To be clear, my review is about the OGX Mens 3 in 1</li>
      <li>(I have two young men in my house)</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Works well on my son&#x27;s curly hair and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>If you have long hair, get a different kind of Organix conditioner because you will go through half a bottle of conditioner with this</li>
      <li>&gt; -It lathers in the hair just fine, and you can still get away with using a small amount at a time.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
      <li>Upon removing the cap the bottle was only half full, poured out and measured to 8 fl ounces.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-I have added a little bit of Tea Tree Oil (essential oil) to the bottle to add a bit of the tingle to the scalp, and some extra benefits to skin and hair as well.(again, I suggest 100% pure) added to the shampoo will provide that tingle if that is what you&#x27;re wanting.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found ANY other product that works so well on my skin to keep it from breaking out (I have very sensitive skin)</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t found ANY other product that works so well on my skin to keep it from breaking out (I have very sensitive skin)</li>
<li> -There&#x27;s very very few synthetic ingredients, that (so far) have not been proven harmful to the skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> I bought this for my husband since he breaks out in a rash when he tries to use any product with sulfate.</li>
<li> &gt; -I have noticed that some of the reviews, seem to be of a few different versions of this OGX Organix product.  </li>
<li> Low lather rinses easily no need for separate conditioner each time I shampoo.  </li>
<li> ,slight mint is what I notice but is gone by the time I dry off.</li>
<li> Worked fine but might have had a bad batch of scent, there was zero smell.</li>
<li> I have to withdrawal my previous recommendation due to this change.</li>
<li> I was having trouble with some other products breaking me out, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
<li> &gt; -Over half of the ingredient list is made from plant</li>
<li> Turns out there is a hidden ingredient in this line of Organix - Wheat.</li>
<li> times it has been used as body wash, a small amount has been used, with plenty of lather as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> No more girly smelling hair for me!</li>
<li> sadly, this wash is no good for us...</li>
<li> I bought this for my boyfriend because I hated the smell of his other 3 in 1 shower product.</li>
<li> Also, the conditioner is very thin.</li>
<li> These product would cause a reaction to somebody that suffers from Celiac Disease.  </li>
<li> Well, I&#x27;ve been getting sick after spending time with him and couldn&#x27;t figure out why...</li>

    <li> Husband loves it and the scent - he is very sensitive to &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; and this one is just right.</li>
    <li> Good price for product. Smells great in bottle, but does not leave that fragrant scent on body.</li>
    <li> Worked fine but might have had a bad batch of scent, there was zero smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because I hated the smell of his other 3 in 1 shower product. It smells great, made him feel clean, and didn&#x27;t cause him to break out (which sometimes is a problem for him). Well, I&#x27;ve been getting sick after spending time with him and couldn&#x27;t figure out why... Turns out there is a hidden ingredient in this line of Organix - Wheat. I recently was diagnosed with Celiac Disease and cut out all gluten from my diet and body products, but didn&#x27;t think about the shampoo I got for him till recently. The normal Citrus Mint Shampoo lists the \\&quot;hydrolyzed wheat protein\\&quot; in the ingredients but the Organix website states that that line of products are not gluten free. I emailed the company and asked specifically about the 3 in 1 and here is their response:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for contacting us! Yes, our Citrus Mint and Biotin &amp; Collagen range DO contain gluten (hydrolyzed wheat protein).  These product would cause a reaction to somebody that suffers from Celiac Disease.  I hope this helps!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So sadly, this wash is no good for us... but I only knocked one star off for not listing this ingredient because it really is a great product. Hope I am able to help someone out there who needs gluten free items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;I just received a few more emails from Organix which brings my rating from a 4 star to a 5 star, they made a mistake with the information provided in the first email. Here is the final email I received from them:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for your patience.  This ingredient is not included in the 3-in-1.  The wheat protein is included as a hair conditioning agent, but is not used as a skin conditioning agent.  As the three in one is a 3-in-1 body wash, this ingredient is not used. Have a great hair day!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the 3 in 1 IS gluten free after all, just not the other products in the Citrus Mint line. :-)</li>
    <li> Perfect for the guys!!!!!!!!!! (I have two young men in my house) they love it.</li>
    <li> Organix products are great!  This 3 in 1 product is great for a swimmer to have in their swim team backpack for a quick shower after practice.  Works well on my son&#x27;s curly hair and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> -I have been searching forever for a shampoo and body wash in one for men that are not laden with chemicals and synthetics .&lt;br /&gt; -Over half of the ingredient list is made from plant oils.&lt;br /&gt; -There&#x27;s very very few synthetic ingredients, that (so far) have not been proven harmful to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;-There are a lot of shampoos, conditioners and soaps/body washes for women, but it took me forever to find something that worked well for men.&lt;br /&gt; -The smell has been approved by my husband and my son.&lt;br /&gt; -They have both stated that it gives them the same amount of \\&quot;clean\\&quot; as the chemical-laden shampoos and body washes.&lt;br /&gt; -It lathers in the hair just fine, and you can still get away with using a small amount at a time.&lt;br /&gt;-The times it has been used as body wash, a small amount has been used, with plenty of lather as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -I have noticed that some of the reviews, seem to be of a few different versions of this OGX Organix product.  To be clear, my review is about the OGX Mens 3 in 1 (shampoo + conditioner + body wash) Invigorating Citrus Mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I have added a little bit of Tea Tree Oil (essential oil) to the bottle to add a bit of the tingle to the scalp, and some extra benefits to skin and hair as well.(again, I suggest 100% pure) added to the shampoo will provide that tingle if that is what you&#x27;re wanting.  However, the tingle does not mean it&#x27;s a better clean.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.  Love the smell and I feel clean but not like I have some film left.</li>
    <li> the combo is not as good as the separate shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Clean citrus smell and has no residue</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and I love the way it makes him smell. Very clean and manly. I love everything about the organix line.</li>
    <li> I look forward to using this every morning, it smells kind of sweet and citrusy. I was having trouble with some other products breaking me out, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I genuinely appreciate the convenience of a 3-in-1, especially at the gym. I was getting this at WalMart, but they stopped carrying it at my local store so it&#x27;s great to know I can order it here :)</li>
    <li> bought this to try out and realized that I paid way too much for it through Amazon.  Can get this in some of our local stores for $5.00.  Great product overall however, and only gets 3 stars because of the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift he loved it&lt;br /&gt;Great brand &amp; price for what you get&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again  thanks !</li>
    <li> Product says it&#x27;s 13 fl ounces, only received 8 fl ounces. Upon removing the cap the bottle was only half full, poured out and measured to 8 fl ounces. No evidence of leakage in the box.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and works well. It just cost a pretty bill.</li>
    <li> I have been using Organix for a good while because it is the healthiest shampoo and conditioner you can buy for 5 bucks but this men&#x27;s formula just recently showed up at my local Wal-Mart. No more girly smelling hair for me! It is great for your hair and has a good minty smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, the mint and tee tree oil is not tingly on the scalp like some good salon shampoos. Also, the conditioner is very thin. If you have long hair, get a different kind of Organix conditioner because you will go through half a bottle of conditioner with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Organix seems to have changed the product, following the current trend of Men&#x27;s hair products being \\&quot;all in one.\\&quot; 2 in 1 shampoo is the same as Wash+Wax... it only does one of the two and doesn&#x27;t do it well. I have to withdrawal my previous recommendation due to this change. The Mint one is not girly and still comes seperately.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo/wash with mild scent, although don&#x27;t expect that &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; sensation on your scalp, that some other mint shampoos provide.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I haven&#x27;t found ANY other product that works so well on my skin to keep it from breaking out (I have very sensitive skin) but I like to have the clean fresh smell that still is masculine. I have ordered several of these just so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son to have in his college dorm - to save space, smell great, etc.  He really likes it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it. He won&#x27;t use anything else now. Great smell and all in one bottle.</li>
    <li> I got this for myself to keep in my gym bag.  Low lather rinses easily no need for separate conditioner each time I shampoo.  I have sensitive skin and I did not have any reaction.  Smell is neutral not over powering or too much,slight mint is what I notice but is gone by the time I dry off.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since he breaks out in a rash when he tries to use any product with sulfate. It smells great (according to both of us) and isn&#x27;t \\&quot;girly\\&quot; (according to him). Much better price than the only other sulfate free 3 in 1 that we have found for men; price is important since he uses a generous amount each day.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this. My boyfriend has been using my conditioner, and a lot of it. This is the first product we have found for men that has conditioner as well. He loves it.</li>
