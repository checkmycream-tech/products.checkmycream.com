      <li>It is not, however, very attractive hanging like that...</li>

      <li>Great Mirror !!</li>
      <li>in all, we are very happy with our purchase.</li>
      <li>The leds are very bright</li>
      <li>Great product, I always shave in the shower and the 2 LEDs are really bright and angled perfectly.</li>
      <li>I was happy with the service &amp; the quailty of this product.</li>
      <li>The clock is a great feature.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In summary, the idea is great --- use this product to increase your morning routine productivity.  </li>
      <li>This one works great.</li>
      <li>This product I am happy to say is both.</li>
      <li>how bright it us.</li>
      <li>, though the product is advertized as having a non-fog feature, after a month of use the mirror did indeed begin to fog-up and needs to be wiped in order to get a good image.</li>
      <li>If it is not in my hands when I purchase it, is it really good quality and will it work correctly?</li>
      <li>The light works great though!</li>
      <li>light didnt turn off, mirror wouldnt stick on shower wall, and mirror became foggy!!</li>
      <li>What more could I ask for!</li>
      <li>My son-in-law  just love it!</li>
      <li>Amazing toy for my husband.</li>
      <li>, you can&#x27;t see it because of acute blindness and impenetrable fog, but it does stay up on the shower wall; which, frankly, I did not expect.</li>
      <li>Word to the wise if you purchase this item, pay for the better shipping, buy the fogless spray, and hang it by the rope given in the kit.</li>
      <li>you will get a nice result.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my roomate as a Christmas gift and it looked really nice once it was taken out of it&#x27;s package.</li>
      <li>Good Luck :)</li>
      <li>additional features are nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, bulky, and most of all does not work!!</li>
      <li>On the plus side its very nice to have the light and clock at eye level.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>Clock doesn&#x27;t work, light is to bright, waiting for the mirror to fog up.</li>
      <li>The timed light is a LED and bright.</li>
      <li>they all work great the first year..</li>
      <li>I have to stoop a bit to see my face, but it&#x27;s still better than no mirror at all.</li>
      <li>Most products that I buy on the web</li>
      <li>and (hopefully) better lit one.</li>
      <li>: the number 8 more resembled a 9.</li>
      <li>My suggestion is by something better and save the 30 bucks on this one.</li>
      <li>This review echos most out there:  </li>
      <li>Likewise, the LCD clock is great for keeping tabs on valuable minutes while racing to get ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ok, could be brighter.  </li>
      <li>Eventually no amount of cleaning was able to make it a mirror, let alone a fogless one.  </li>
      <li>and it had much better lighting</li>
      <li>For $30, you can do much better elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I love this mirror</li>
      <li>Oh well, should have read the reviews better.</li>
      <li>The bright blue-white LED is nice in the early morning.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, there&#x27;s a towel bar in the shower, so I was able to hang the mirror by the shower stall clip.</li>
      <li>The product was easy to install.  </li>
      <li>There are several ways to hang this model, the clock is handy and the led light gives off a fair amount of light.</li>
      <li>My husband tied it to our shampoo rack and says it&#x27;s fine for him.  </li>
      <li>The mirror is fine - they all start to fog up regardless of claims - but I do not care for the light.  </li>
      <li>The light -</li>
      <li>The light works</li>
      <li>The light does not shut itself off.</li>
      <li>It is lighted and the light works, hence the 2 stars, as opposed to 1.  </li>
      <li>The light, however, seems to have a pinpoint focus and the brightness of an arc welder; rendering one sightless for the remainder of the shave.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it was shipping or just cheap craftsmanship.</li>
      <li>Also, additional source of light is always needed.</li>
      <li>LED light&#x27;s placement below the mirror doesn&#x27;t provide even illumination to the face, but it&#x27;s passable.</li>
      <li>The clock, though, has proven more useful than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mirror itself appears somewhat cheap as it is coated plastic instead of glass.  </li>
      <li>The light stays on for 5 minutes and auto shuts off.</li>
      <li>The LED light will not shed any light on your face unless you are shaving you Eye balls  </li>
      <li>Hubby doesnt use the clock or light.</li>
      <li>Even though you can&#x27;t see anything when trying to look in the mirror (because you&#x27;re blinded by the light)</li>
      <li>I use the mirror without the light</li>
      <li>However, the light is glaringly bright-in your eye, but not around the mirror (which will work for a minute or two if you spray it with water).  </li>
      <li>but fogless that&#x27;s a joke, light still works,</li>
      <li>However, right after the warranty ended most of the clock&#x27;s segments stopped working.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon</li>
      <li>It does get fogged and you have to constantly clean it.</li>
      <li>There is a warning in the instructions that tells you not to clean it with glass cleaner as it will ruin the fogless coating.  </li>
      <li>What they don&#x27;t tell you is that you cannot clean the thing, period.  </li>
      <li>I tried to clean it with the softest cloths and sponges that I could find, all of which scratched it beyond repair and did not remove the spots.  </li>
      <li>Also without the special soap the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror fogs up after about a month of use.</li>
      <li>Now it is not real complicated, but it does not fog up, holds my razor just fine and is easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect that it is going to replace adequate bathroom lighting.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend its a pretty cheap product</li>
      <li>One good thing is that  suction cups still hold it up as long as I press them in every week.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The led light that it has gives off a decent amount of light.</li>
      <li>I really like the light since it is on a 5 minute timer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other features make this product worth considering.  </li>
      <li>is worth considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price is right ...</li>
      <li>I removed my comment right when we hung up</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right, once you hit the button it stays on for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>But it shines right in my eyes and makes it hard to shave while squinting against the bright light.</li>
      <li>We loved our previous mirror like this.  </li>
      <li>Second, better directions are needed to restore the surface quality of the mirror.  </li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s almost blinding</li>
      <li>So make sure not to accidentally hit that button or you will be blinded for the next 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased this mirror for my husband several months ago and we have been pleased with it.</li>
      <li>This mirror fogged up the first time I used it and has done so faithfully every time since.</li>
      <li>The mirror does not fog no matter how hot the shower is.</li>
      <li>They add an anti-fog towelette to wipe it down when it does though, even better!</li>
      <li>I believe this one to be just as good as the more expensive models and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>And if you think the light it cool, it&#x27;s the most useless light ever.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced the fogging problem noted by other reviewers, but I keep the bathroom door open when I use the shower.</li>
      <li>This is pretty simple just take some hand soap on a washcloth and lightly scrub the surface.</li>
      <li>Third is that it scratches easily which I can&#x27;t figure out because I have never had anything on the surface except water.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although the product page does tell you that you need 3 AA batteries to operate the mirror, the batteries really only supply energy to the light feature.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is Chinese made low quality crap. It came with an old adhesion tape that lost its stick, and 3 suction cups. We mounted it in the shower, and it promptly fell off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Its not only Chinese and low quality, it was priced way out of line.&lt;br /&gt;It a $5 item, not $20!&lt;br /&gt;Run away from this!</li>
    <li> LED light works properly but the fogless part is not true. It does get fogged and you have to constantly clean it. the overall design is not bad with the time display and razor holder.</li>
    <li> Fogless it is not, it fogs up everyday. There was a ring in the middle that never clears even if I wipe the glass it&#x27;s constantly foggy. I would not recommend its a pretty cheap product but I should have known for $20</li>
    <li> I bought this for my roomate as a Christmas gift and it looked really nice once it was taken out of it&#x27;s package. A few things you should know about the mirror though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product page does tell you that you need 3 AA batteries to operate the mirror, the batteries really only supply energy to the light feature. In the same compartment where the batteries are stored, there is another compartment completely where a smaller watch type battery is needed to operate the time feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror did come with such a battery already in place, I later found out, but it was actually drained of it&#x27;s energy. I had to take the mirror to a watch store at my local mall in order to get a new one, in addition to the 3 AA batteries for the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that one month after all the mirror batteries were put in place and was put into use, the digital time feature began to lose some of it&#x27;s black markings. example: the number 8 more resembled a 9. I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the mirror already going through the newly installed battery&#x27;s entire power cell or if the item is defective. Either way, it&#x27;s not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, though the product is advertized as having a non-fog feature, after a month of use the mirror did indeed begin to fog-up and needs to be wiped in order to get a good image.</li>
    <li> Most products that I buy on the web I am a little leary of. If it is not in my hands when I purchase it, is it really good quality and will it work correctly? This product I am happy to say is both. Now it is not real complicated, but it does not fog up, holds my razor just fine and is easy to keep clean. What more could I ask for! So I recommend it.</li>
    <li> While the actual mirror on this product has not lived up to its claim, the Zadro LED lighted Fogless Mirror is worth considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with previous \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors basically lessened my expectations for this product.  Essentially, the concept is flawed as the mirrors don&#x27;t stay fogless.  Moreover, water spray makes using such mirrors relatively difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other features make this product worth considering.  The bright blue-white LED is nice in the early morning. Likewise, the LCD clock is great for keeping tabs on valuable minutes while racing to get ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself appears somewhat cheap as it is coated plastic instead of glass.  Other undesirable features include an all-to-brief automatic LED shutoff, which begins to dim in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the idea is great --- use this product to increase your morning routine productivity.  Unfortunately, the execution falls short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Bright Light&lt;br /&gt;Clock&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive Mirror&lt;br /&gt;Auto shutoff too rapid</li>
    <li> I got this for a wedding present.  First, like others have said the fog-less part only lasts for a week or so.  Next the thing constantly falls down to poor mount design.  Any slight bump and it drops.  Third is that it scratches easily which I can&#x27;t figure out because I have never had anything on the surface except water.  Fourth is the the back battery cover is not waterproof and corrosion quickly sets in.  My suggestion is by something better and save the 30 bucks on this one.</li>
    <li> This review echos most out there:  the mirror is fogless for about a week and then operates like every other mirror, the suction cups only adhere to glass otherwise fall off while you are at work, the clock stops working if it gets steamy.    Zadro makes a cheaper $20 model, or you could just buy a handheld for $5, some ski goggle fogless cleaner, and a shoe string for the same affect.    Having a mirror in the shower is helpful, but practical at $10-$20, not $40.</li>
    <li> the suction cups are situated so that we can&#x27;t use it on the tiles in our bathroom.  That plus our tiles have an uneven surface, so the cups don&#x27;t stick anyway.  My husband tied it to our shampoo rack and says it&#x27;s fine for him.  It is not, however, very attractive hanging like that...</li>
    <li> Sipley put the Item is JUNK.  Ill make it simple...  1. The thing fogs worse than the ones that dont advertise Fogless.  2. The LED light will not shed any light on your face unless you are shaving you Eye balls  it just blinds you.  3. The flimsy plastic razor holder will break off about a day after you get it.  After you buy it Dont say you where not warned. Good Luck :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my husband several months ago and we have been pleased with it. I will admit, that the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; part did not last. But in our experience, it never does. We have had a lot of success with rubbing a little bit of soap on it and then spraying it with the shower head. By doing that it will stay clear for the remainder of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional features are nice. There are several ways to hang this model, the clock is handy and the led light gives off a fair amount of light. I really like the light since it is on a 5 minute timer. I just push the button when I get into the shower and it keeps me from taking a shower that is too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The led light that it has gives off a decent amount of light. Don&#x27;t expect that it is going to replace adequate bathroom lighting. Our bathroom is very small and dark. This mirror gives off just enough light to see what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, we are very happy with our purchase.</li>
    <li> The mirror did come with a clock battery already in place, I later found out, but it was actually drained of it&#x27;s energy. I had to take the mirror to a watch store at my local mall in order to get a new one, in addition to the 3 AA batteries for the light.   Heads up..... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This mirror was horrible. It worked well for about a week then it had to be wiped down. Eventually no amount of cleaning was able to make it a mirror, let alone a fogless one.  Do yourself a favor and not buy this product.</li>
    <li> light didnt turn off, mirror wouldnt stick on shower wall, and mirror became foggy!!</li>
    <li> The fogless mirror worked at first, but after a few months it wasn&#x27;t so fogless anymore. The light works great though!</li>
    <li> Hi, bought this last year and I was very disappointed in the performance. It fogged up everytime and then it wouldn&#x27;t stay attached to the shower wall. It would fall at least once a week. Followed instructions, but no help. Doesn&#x27;t work as far as I&#x27;m concerned!    Thanks,  John W. Young</li>
    <li> This mirror fogged up the first time I used it and has done so faithfully every time since. The suction cups don&#x27;t work so the mirror regularly falls on the shower floor, usually in the middle of the night. The clock doesn&#x27;t work anymore...probably from the hits on the shower floor. This is all within six weeks after purchase. This deserves a \\&quot;0\\&quot; rating, is a total waste of time and money and is just a lousy product.</li>
    <li> I think it stayed fogless for two uses.  After that, it fogged up like any ordinary mirror - even with using the \\&quot;special glass cleaner\\&quot; it came with.  Too bad.  Total dissappointment.</li>
    <li> Wow how cool is this I can shower and shave at the same time and not worry about cutting my throat. I love this mirror I only wish I would have bought it years ago.</li>
    <li> First: I purchased a similar product at Sharper Image and it had much better lighting - it was spread around vs. pinpoint with this model.  The mirror went bad after 6 months - but as luck would have it SI dropped the item and thus no replacement parts (thanks guys). The offered up this one as a replacement.  The mirror is fine - they all start to fog up regardless of claims - but I do not care for the light.  Looking to replace with another and (hopefully) better lit one.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this package, I immediately noticed that the Zadro product box had been previously opened and torn. Also, the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror, even with regular usage of the special cleaning fluid, fogs.</li>
    <li> Clock doesn&#x27;t work, light is to bright, waiting for the mirror to fog up. Oh well, should have read the reviews better.</li>
    <li> I was excited about finally getting a mirror for the shower that wouldn&#x27;t fog and was lighted. Well, the mirror hasn&#x27;t fogged yet. But, cold weather hasn&#x27;t reached south Texas, yet, so the real test will come when I try to shave in a chilly shower enclosure. The light - well that&#x27;s another issue. The timed light is a LED and bright. But it shines right in my eyes and makes it hard to shave while squinting against the bright light. I use the mirror without the light so I&#x27;d give the rig a 50% rating overall.</li>
    <li> they all work great the first year.. but fogless that&#x27;s a joke, light still works,</li>
    <li> On the plus side its very nice to have the light and clock at eye level.&lt;br /&gt;On the minus the light doesn&#x27;t hit me where the older model did and its only fogless if you spray it with anti-fog solution.</li>
    <li> This was on of the less expensive fogless mirrors I found. The leds are very bright and I like the clock and razor holder. You will need to wash it about once a week to keep it working properly. This is pretty simple just take some hand soap on a washcloth and lightly scrub the surface. Its plastic so use a soft cloth to avoid scratches. I had it for about a year and still haven&#x27;t had to replace the batteries. I believe this one to be just as good as the more expensive models and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I finally bought a shower mirror.This one works great.The light stays on for 5 minutes and auto shuts off. It has a little razor holder on it and it doesn&#x27;t steam up! Great Mirror !!</li>
    <li> This mirror fogs up as bad or worse than any other mirror my husband has every used in the shower.</li>
    <li> Nothing else you could ask for out of an in shower mirror.  I shave my head every day, and I do it in the shower, so I&#x27;ve been through a lot of mirrors.  Definately the best one I&#x27;ve had.  Its been over a month and a half with no treatment to it and fog is just now starting to show up.  They add an anti-fog towelette to wipe it down when it does though, even better!</li>
    <li> While I did not have the battery problems mentioned by other reviewers, I also had problems with the mirror fogging within a month of use.  There appears to be a chemical coating on the plastic mirror that deteriorates over time.  Now it functions a just another mirror that must be wiped constantly if it&#x27;s used in the shower.  For $30, you can do much better elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Amazing toy for my husband. The mirror does not fog no matter how hot the shower is. I would recommend installing on the side wall of the shower if possible, easier to use and see. The clock is a great feature.</li>
    <li> The clock on this product does not work. The light does not shut itself off. These are both things the description said it should do. The only thing it does is stay semi-fogless. This is a rip off, do not buy.</li>
    <li> bought it and it worked for like a month. now it just sits in my room doing nothing. i am going to look for the company information and try to get my money back. if you are going to get a shower mirror pay a little more and get quality.</li>
    <li> This mirror losts it&#x27;s luster a month after use and start to fog up and 3 months after use I couldn&#x27;t see myself in it this is how bad this mirror is, I have used a $9.00 mirror that I bought from target it last copuple of years finaly I throw it away because the mildew on it, my advice don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of cr%p.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced the fogging problem noted by other reviewers, but I keep the bathroom door open when I use the shower. By the way, the anti-fogging wipe provided with the mirror uses isopropyl alcohol; a bottle of this and a soft cloth would work just as well and be much cheaper than buying replacement wipes from Zadro. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My big problem with the mirror was that the suction cups repeatedly lost their hold after a few minutes -- and this was on perfectly clean and dry tile (and yes, not on the grout). Fortunately, there&#x27;s a towel bar in the shower, so I was able to hang the mirror by the shower stall clip. I have to stoop a bit to see my face, but it&#x27;s still better than no mirror at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The LED light&#x27;s placement below the mirror doesn&#x27;t provide even illumination to the face, but it&#x27;s passable. The razor holder works fine for my standard disposable razor but is too small for a bulkier unit such as my wife&#x27;s Gillette Venus. The clock, though, has proven more useful than I anticipated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star for the non-functioning suction cups and one star for the LED and razor holder design flaws.</li>
    <li> Mirror was fogless for about a week.  Have to constantly wipe down the mirror while shaving even with the shower turned off.  What a piece of junk.  $30 for what????</li>
    <li> This mirror is amazingly cheap and low quality.  It feels cheap because it is entirely made of plastic, even the mirror.  The clock loses a few minutes per month, so I am constantly reseting it.  One of the LEDs failed after a month which is fine with me because when the mirror is placed so that I can see my face well, they are shining directly into my eyes.  As some other users have said, the mirror is fogless for a week or so.  There is a warning in the instructions that tells you not to clean it with glass cleaner as it will ruin the fogless coating.  What they don&#x27;t tell you is that you cannot clean the thing, period.  The plastic is very soft and therefore scratched by anything.  The included KFC quality wetnap is completely ineffective against hard water spots, and that is the only thing recommended for cleaning.  I tried to clean it with the softest cloths and sponges that I could find, all of which scratched it beyond repair and did not remove the spots.  In short, you pay $40 for a cracker jack quality mirror.  I am taking a few minutes to write this review just before I toss this thing in the trash.  Incidentally, this is the same mirror that is marketed by The Discovery Channel store and Brookstone.</li>
    <li> it works for a week. &lt;br /&gt;we should start a class action lawsuit against zadro.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The mirror did not work, the lights and clock did not work and I did contact the seller who told me to send it back but since the mirror had been taken out of the box and the box was totally messed up, I would have to get a new box and take it to the UPS place to send it which would have cost me about another $10 and quite frankly, it was just not worth the time nor the money.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for over a year now. It works well for first few months but, later, it starts to fog. Now, it is like any ordinary mirror and serves me more as a razor holder than a fog-less mirror. Also, additional source of light is always needed.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been through a bunch of these mirrors, this has been one of the worst.  After 1 month the mirror is no longer fogless and worse it collects water so that i can barely see my face when in the shower.  look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Not that much better than those selling for half as much or less. Hubby doesnt use the clock or light.</li>
    <li> FOGLESS- not true.  If I get a new one sent to me that works, ill change my review thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror for years and will continue to do so because I have learned to live with its flaws.  First, will someone in the manufacturing process STOP applying a quarter size round sticker (saying please remove protective cover) in the center of the mirror.  The application of the sticker has enough force to damage the surface and you will forever have to live with a quarter size defect in the center of the mirror.  Second, better directions are needed to restore the surface quality of the mirror.  It took me years to realize that applying a \\&quot;409\\&quot; like surface cleaner will restore it to almost \\&quot;new\\&quot; IF you let it DRY first.  You must also apply a little hand soap right as you are going use it and then quickly rinse ... you will get a nice result.  The price is right ... but WHY that sticker Zadro?  Just Google your product and you will see this as a repeated complaint for YEARS! Good grief!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend NOT purchasing this product. It&#x27;s cheap, bulky, and most of all does not work!! I ordered this because I wanted a shower mirror with a clock. The first one was completely defective- the clock would not even turn on. I then had it replaced with another. This time the clock worked in the beginning (except for the fact that the buttons only work when you press them with a hard object, they don&#x27;t work with your fingers which is stupid). However, after one day it started malfunctioning and the display was going in and out. Then it resets itself over and over. This is the worst product I have purchased on Amazon. And if you think the light it cool, it&#x27;s the most useless light ever. First, it&#x27;s almost blinding how bright it us. Second, YOU CAN&#x27;T TURN IT OFF! That&#x27;s right, once you hit the button it stays on for 5 minutes. So make sure not to accidentally hit that button or you will be blinded for the next 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a terrible waste of money. I never write reviews, but I&#x27;m so disgusted with this product that I felt obligated to let others know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> my son needs to stay out of my bathroom...</li>
    <li> We loved our previous mirror like this.  This one came as a magnifying mirror.  Not sure yet if I like it.</li>
    <li> Suction cups didn&#x27;t work, kept falling off after less than 1 day&lt;br /&gt;Clock didn&#x27;t work at all, even with the battery</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift. My son-in-law  just love it! I was happy with the service &amp; the quailty of this product. Pat</li>
    <li> Works as promised, light is a little funky and almost seems useless but it is still a great mirror for us shower shavers!</li>
    <li> Came to my house broken. Don&#x27;t know if it was shipping or just cheap craftsmanship. Clock stopped working after three days and suction cups never held with the added weight of the razor. Also without the special soap the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror fogs up after about a month of use. Word to the wise if you purchase this item, pay for the better shipping, buy the fogless spray, and hang it by the rope given in the kit.</li>
    <li> I installed this item with the double sided tape and it fell off the shower wall.  When it came down it broke off a small piece.</li>
    <li> The product was easy to install.  I used the suction cups provided. I have a fiberglass shower.  The light works Ok, could be brighter.  My shower is quite dark so the clock is hard to read.  I have had no trouble with the mirror fog up.  That part of the mirror is as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am on my second Zadro LED Lighted Fogless Mirror - Yes, customer service was decent and they sent me a new one. However, the initial problem was repeated plus some -- it fogs up despite following directions, using their spray, and using words I shouln&#x27;t repeat here. Additionally, the clock runs slow and one of the two lights is out after only a few months. One good thing is that  suction cups still hold it up as long as I press them in every week. This product has problems which make a mockery of its \\&quot;ZFogless\\&quot; claim. Save yourself the trouble -- don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas. I had seen it in magazines but it was expensive for this product, I thought. I was so excited to find it on Amazon and he just LOVES it. He shaves in the shower and the mirror never fogs. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain about it not being fogless because the only truly fogless mirrors are the ones that attach to the shower head and have water running through. However, right after the warranty ended most of the clock&#x27;s segments stopped working. Then one of the two LEDs. Also, razor holder will not hold Gillette&#x27;s Fusion. This was my first of two different Zadro mirrors. Both were junk.</li>
    <li> I recieved the mirror and the clock did not work. I left a negative review so someone called me and told me that if I removed my negative feedback then they would do an even exchange. I removed my comment right when we hung up and I have yet to receive a new mirror. Not happy.</li>
    <li> If, by fogless, the manufacturer actually meant, \\&quot;fogs up almost instantly,\\&quot; then they have correctly described this mirror. It is lighted and the light works, hence the 2 stars, as opposed to 1.  The light, however, seems to have a pinpoint focus and the brightness of an arc welder; rendering one sightless for the remainder of the shave.  The combination of extreme fog and scorched retinas does not make for an enjoyable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does stay up on the shower wall; thus, I&#x27;ll give credit where credit is due.  Mind you, you can&#x27;t see it because of acute blindness and impenetrable fog, but it does stay up on the shower wall; which, frankly, I did not expect.</li>
    <li> The suction on this mirror sometimes failed, causing the mirror to fall to the ground.  Fortunately the mirror is some sort of material that does not easily break.</li>
    <li> It does what is should do.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe we wasted this much money on this piece of junk. I wouldn&#x27;t be quite as upset if this were a $5 &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror-but it isn&#x27;t fogless and nothing helps that. But just as bad is that it is supposed to also have this light-which it does. However, the light is glaringly bright-in your eye, but not around the mirror (which will work for a minute or two if you spray it with water).  Making matters worse, the batteries seem to drain EVERY month and the mirror&#x27;s way of letting you know the batteries are dying is apparently to have the light turn itself on and off-but primarily ON until it is dead. Even though you can&#x27;t see anything when trying to look in the mirror (because you&#x27;re blinded by the light) it is extremely bright as a flashing strobe light in the wee hours of the morning-and apparently, the batteries have enough juice that this can go on for a few days! Argh.</li>
    <li> Great product, I always shave in the shower and the 2 LEDs are really bright and angled perfectly. The anti fog coating didn&#x27;t last too long, but I used a tiny bit of my Palmolive Shower Gel soap and that kept the condensation at bay.</li>
    <li> will not stay on the wall of shower and the clock is not working well</li>
