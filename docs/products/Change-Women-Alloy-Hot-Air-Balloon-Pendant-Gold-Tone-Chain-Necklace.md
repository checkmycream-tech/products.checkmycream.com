      <li>It appears nice overall, but honestly I probably could have done a better job with the paint and will probably end up doing some touch ups</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t perfectly &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; shaped (but what hot air balloon is?) and has an air bubble in the paint, but that isn&#x27;t bothering anyone, especially me!</li>

      <li>So here&#x27;s my quick list of pros &amp; cons for anyone still sitting on the fence:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>then I thought it would be other wise fine</li>
      <li>Just way to large for me to feel comfortable wearing it.</li>
      <li>Your not out anything and its definitely worth giving it a try.  </li>
      <li>This cute little pendant arrived way ahead of time, It is really eye catching.</li>
      <li>The colors on the hot air ballon necklace I got were much darker than the ones pictured and look as though they were painted with nail polish rather than the more classy touch of well-crafted jewelry.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this piece, it looks expensive and well made.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>Chain is a bit flimsy and short but the balloon is adorable.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Looks pretty though.</li>
      <li>: eye-catching piece, unique, moving parts, reasonable delivery time, decent chain that matches pendant, cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I will buy a second one</li>
      <li>Nice for little girls or teens.  </li>
      <li>PARTS, SOFT, PRETTY PASTELS, 36&amp;#34; CHAINS.3&#x27; BALLOON AND BASKET!&lt;br /&gt;ORDERED</li>
      <li>The colors are more dramatic on the actual product that in the photo (the photo looks more pastel).</li>
      <li>I love the size and the little clear rhinestone around the bottom of the balloon.  </li>
      <li>It looks exactly like the picture and came earlier than I thought.</li>
      <li>Received quickly and compliments are endless.  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised by the guality of this item.  </li>
      <li>I give it two stars because it came earlier than it said it would, but don&#x27;t expect much from a $1 necklace.</li>
      <li>I was excited because it looks just like the picture , but when I took it out , the chain had gotten stuck in the uneven slates in the balloon when I tried to get it out</li>
      <li>I hope mine doesn&#x27;t arrive broken though... :)</li>
      <li>A little large for my liking.</li>

<li> A little large for my liking.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s long enough to slip it over your head.</li>
<li> It comes with a long chain.  </li>
<li> (so no swapping unless you want to break the chain), may require a clear coat of nail polish to keep color from fading over time, paint is slightly uneven (but hardly noticeable from a distance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you like wearing sweaters with long necklaces, look no more and buy it.</li>
<li> The colours are slightly brighter than pictured, but they are pastel colours.</li>
<li> just a little heavy</li>
<li> just does not seem as though merchandise is checked before it leaves the warehouse , and even though it was inexpensive it was money that was wasted on something</li>
<li> it&#x27;s long and the basket is small and weirdly portioned but who cares !</li>
<li> Also, the photo makes it look like there are gems at the base of the balloon, and there are not.</li>

    <li> perfect gifts for games for a hot air baloon themed shower.  i was so haooy.  I wish that I had ordered more</li>
    <li> The paint was caked up at the bottom and the rhinestone had fallen off as soon as I got it. It is very very big. I give it two stars because it came earlier than it said it would, but don&#x27;t expect much from a $1 necklace.</li>
    <li> So cute I love it it&#x27;s long and the basket is small and weirdly portioned but who cares ! I know I dont</li>

    <li> it was a lot bigger then I thought it would be other wise fine and I can wear it just a little heavy</li>
    <li> I love the necklace itself , I waited a while for it to arrive , when it showed up I was excited because it looks just like the picture , but when I took it out , the chain had gotten stuck in the uneven slates in the balloon when I tried to get it out it broke and now is unwearable . bummed out because its cute . just does not seem as though merchandise is checked before it leaves the warehouse , and even though it was inexpensive it was money that was wasted on something , I was really excited about and loved.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS necklace.  It is perfect for sweaters.  It comes with a long chain.  I love the size and the little clear rhinestone around the bottom of the balloon.  Especially for the price.  Your not out anything and its definitely worth giving it a try.  I have got many compliments.  If you like wearing sweaters with long necklaces, look no more and buy it.</li>
    <li> These are nicely painted, dimensional pieces.  Nice for little girls or teens.  I was really surprised by the guality of this item.  perfect for inexpensive gift.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the whimsical quality of this charm. My daughter loves it and gets complimented with it. It&#x27;s a youthful piece.</li>
    <li> The colors on the hot air ballon necklace I got were much darker than the ones pictured and look as though they were painted with nail polish rather than the more classy touch of well-crafted jewelry. It appears nice overall, but honestly I probably could have done a better job with the paint and will probably end up doing some touch ups when it&#x27;s all said and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t, however, argue with the price. So here&#x27;s my quick list of pros &amp; cons for anyone still sitting on the fence:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: eye-catching piece, unique, moving parts, reasonable delivery time, decent chain that matches pendant, cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: chain is attached (so no swapping unless you want to break the chain), may require a clear coat of nail polish to keep color from fading over time, paint is slightly uneven (but hardly noticeable from a distance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good deal for the price, but don&#x27;t be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t come out looking exactly like the pictures</li>
    <li> A little large for my liking. Looks pretty though. Just way to large for me to feel comfortable wearing it.</li>
    <li> Different, elegant and good price for quality.  Definitely would recommend.  Received quickly and compliments are endless.  Good product, nice nice</li>
    <li> Great quality and craftsmanship for the price! I have had soo many compliments on this necklace....I love it so much that I will buy a second one if I can just to hang one on my rearview! FLoat ON!!</li>
    <li> Love this necklace. It&#x27;s so unique and I get compliments on it everytime I wear it. It looks exactly like the picture and came earlier than I thought.</li>
    <li> This cute little pendant arrived way ahead of time, It is really eye catching. It was packaged in bubble wrap and arrived in excellent condition. The colours are slightly brighter than pictured, but they are pastel colours. The chain doesn&#x27;t come with a clasp but it&#x27;s long enough to slip it over your head. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it, I love it!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this piece, it looks expensive and well made.  I hope I can Wear it for years to come.</li>
    <li> This air ballon necklace looks really good, really good design and good quality. Exactly what I wanted. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This necklace is the perfect addition to my jewelry box! It isn&#x27;t perfectly &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; shaped (but what hot air balloon is?) and has an air bubble in the paint, but that isn&#x27;t bothering anyone, especially me! I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT!....and it was soooo cheap, WHAT!?!?!?</li>
    <li> Chain is a bit flimsy and short but the balloon is adorable. The detailing on the balloon is awesome. Would probably buy again if chain was sturdier and longer.</li>
    <li> I cant wait until this arrives!!!!!!! My father chases hot air balloons so I am going to be happy when I get this! I hope mine doesn&#x27;t arrive broken though... :)</li>
    <li> Super cute looks jus like in the picture I just have to bu more from u guys awsome stuff likeee</li>
    <li> The colors are more dramatic on the actual product that in the photo (the photo looks more pastel). There is a blue, yellow, turquoise, soft pink. Also, the photo makes it look like there are gems at the base of the balloon, and there are not. I have only had this necklace for one day and have already had a lot of compliments on it. The necklace seems to be well made and doesn&#x27;t seem like its going to break. Overall, I would recommend this.</li>
