      <li>I like the fact that the brush locks for easy storage.</li>

      <li>Different kind of brush.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s not that easy to do, so make sure you section your hair in small portions and start with the areas of your head that have the most shrinkage.</li>
      <li>IT WAS COMING OUT RIGHT,.</li>
      <li>My hair gets very straight with this tool.</li>
      <li>I ended up using a regular boar bristle brush and got better results.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a nice pink color,</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Very nifty!</li>
      <li>Love this, really helps get naturally curly hair straight.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>Product broke first time my daughter used it.</li>
      <li>Works really well and gets my hair super straight.</li>
      <li>Idk if any of this really makes sense but if you were planning to use this how I just described I would get a tension comb instead because you lose less hair and it moves more freely.</li>
      <li>Gets hair pretty straight.</li>
      <li>This brush pretty much pulled my hair out.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use, requires no skill which is great for me - but the process is still tedious and takes way too long for me to do more than infrequently (but that&#x27;s on me, not the brush).&lt;br /&gt;(FYI, for the similarly clueless -</li>
      <li>Very helpful with blow drying my hair.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this straightening brush because I was not about to order the Conair Go Straight at $30.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Now my mom wants me to get her one</li>
      <li>I used to get the Conair Go Straight at CVS for $6.99</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>this really helps with blow drying my hair straight and eliminating frizz.  </li>
      <li>I have really frizzy hair</li>
      <li>I really hoped this would be it for me.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of using the brush; however, it seems a bit unpractical that the brush locks in place once it is closed.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for straightening either.</li>
      <li>Very flimsy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt much when it pulls</li>
      <li>I have very kinky coils (4a/4b), and this helps get my hair bone straight.</li>
      <li>I would comb my hair first then use this and chase it with the straightener to do my hair, but since it grips so tight it doesn&#x27;t move very freely</li>
      <li>but hopefully it will straighten my hair more quickly than usual.</li>
      <li>I had this one for 3 months with only special occasions use, and it broke.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> havent used it yet but im sure it will be good</li>
    <li> The brush is way to rough!!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Love the extras gets my hair super straight!</li>
    <li> Love it it works great and does not get stuck like i heard others say</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Think i had it for a year now maybe. Still works great.</li>
    <li> Now my mom wants me to get her one lol I love this strightning brush 🙆</li>
    <li> I saw a young lady on YouTube use it instead of flat ironing her hair. I decided to buy it and blow my natural 4c hair out. I love it it does add a layer of smoothness to the hair. I used John Freda smooth fixation on it and it worked like a charm. The brittles are hard but long as you don&#x27;t squeeze it hard then your hair should slide through with no clumps or tugging. I just need a product to keep it From reverting back to frizz after a few hours. If anybody knows let me know the secrete!!!!!</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS BRUSH BUT I HAVE ONLY USED IT ONCE &amp; MY HAIR CAME OUT GREAT!!!!!! IM GONNA KEEP PRATICING USING A BRUSH REALLY HELPS, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IM NOT PULLING HAIR OUT USING WITH A BLOW DRYER ;-D</li>
    <li> I really hoped this would be it for me. This brush pretty much pulled my hair out. I took a small section in the back of my 80% dry hair and used as directed and my hair was in the brush. Didn&#x27;t do much for straightening either. My hair was frizzy, but dry! Not what I expected at all. Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is coarse...idk. Good luck...</li>
    <li> Product broke first time my daughter used it.</li>
    <li> Use this brush to cut the time I straighten my hair in half! I run my chi after the brush (using one hand for each) and it prevents any kinks or tangles. Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Great for straightening my hair. It broke :( but it still works</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. Not only did this bush not do a good job of straightening it (I&#x27;m back to my paddle burst) but it also ripped out my hair. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. I used this brush when I flat iron my hair and it does wonders and it cuts the flat ironing process in half. It usually takes me about a hour or so to flat iron my complete head but with this wonderful brush it only took me 30-35 mind tops. RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> The brush is of very good quality. I fell that it will last for a long time.  The bristles are able to withstand high heat temperatures.</li>
    <li> This brush is definitely great if you are going to flat iron your hair. My tip however, is, make sure that your hair is as tangle free as possible as it can pull out your hair a little bit. It you are using this brush for the chase method and you feel as if it is pulling, stop, comb out that section with a fine tooth comb then continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s I have thick curly kinky textured hair (3c, 4a,4b)</li>
    <li> This was so pointless for me</li>
    <li> The Diane Straightening Brush worked wonders on my hair.  When I blew dry my hair is was as straight as if I had flat iron it.  I would recommend this brush for any hair type as I an transitioning from permed hair to natural.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> So far I have only used it with the blow drier but it works great. I will see the results later when I use the flat iron and update review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The brush is broken. At the hinge there is a break that occurred, I assume, from the brush opening quickly and with force. The plastic was not durable enough to handle it I guess. But it is still usable....I&#x27;m not sure for how much longer tho....</li>
    <li> I have very tight curls and I bought this because I thought it would help get my hair straighter when I decided to wear it like that. However, it grips my hair so tight I&#x27;m scared to use it because I feel like I&#x27;m going to lose too much hair. It doesn&#x27;t hurt much when it pulls but I do notice a lot of strands coming out. Maybe my hair is just weak, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. I would comb my hair first then use this and chase it with the straightener to do my hair, but since it grips so tight it doesn&#x27;t move very freely and that would cause even more damage because now my flat iron is on my hair for an extra long time. Idk if any of this really makes sense but if you were planning to use this how I just described I would get a tension comb instead because you lose less hair and it moves more freely.</li>
    <li> Do not like the material that the bristles are made of - they are not very smooth sliding (atleast not on my hair)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great tool for blow drying and flat ironing. I am African American 4b relaxed hair. Perfect for a silky texture. I also use silicon mix conditioning cream</li>
    <li> I love the idea of using the brush; however, it seems a bit unpractical that the brush locks in place once it is closed. I would prefer to hold it shut rather than opening it up for each application.</li>
    <li> Nice product for value and price. Takes time to get used to using. Different kind of brush. Gets hair pretty straight. Feels like it pulls on hair at times but maybe its how you handle it</li>
    <li> Works extremely well! I use it all the time while flat ironing my hair and or my weave! Only need one pass through</li>
    <li> Works well! This was a replacement for something my six year old broke.  I am happy with this product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The brush is really good, was easy blow dry my Hair and use the flat iron, the Hair was looking really good and soft... BUT after a couple of hours my Hair was looking so frizzing and I never has frizz!!! The idea is really good but not for me</li>
    <li> Just got  this today I use it on stepdaughter hair it came out great I will use on my hair  tomorrow for some medium long hair</li>
    <li> Very flimsy. It broke within a few uses</li>
    <li> Great! This Diane Straightening Brush will allow you to get a good clamp down on a section of hair so that you can pull it through while blowing dry. I got fabulous results because I sectioned off my hair and worked in a methodical manner. If you just randomly grab at hair yanking and pulling from one section to another you will not get the same results. If you take your time to work it right the professional results will appear faster and last longer! Make it full and straight or turn it under for a page boy effect, this tool is as good as the effort you put into it.</li>
    <li> I do not like this brush. The bristles are very hard and also stiff.. it was ripping my hair out of my head</li>
    <li> This product did a very nice job of helping to straighten my hair. I ended up just using this product to give my hair just a little bit of a straightening with my blow dryer and not my flat iron or any other hot tool that straightens hair, for now. It did a great job of pulling my hair and getting the &amp;#34;kinks&amp;#34; out so that it could blow dry straight. The bristles are defiantly on the harder side, which is what I wanted. so be aware of that when lookin to purchase this kind of product.</li>
    <li> This brush cuts my straightening time in half. I have really frizzy hair and when I use this it helps reduced frizzines.</li>
    <li> Just got it today and it&#x27;s a nice pink color, not what was I expecting but it&#x27;s still cute. The bristles are kinda hard but hopefully it will straighten my hair more quickly than usual.</li>
    <li> This brush was not good for thick, curly hair...</li>
    <li> Love this, really helps get naturally curly hair straight.</li>
    <li> Great straightening brush.</li>
    <li> Works really well and gets my hair super straight. I also use it when I do other people hair. Its a great product to have if you love to wear your hair bone straight</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH, ITS SO HANDY AND IT HELPS ME ALOT WITH STRAIGHTENING MY HAIR, IM NATURAL SO I NEEDED THIS REAL BAD CAUSE WHEN I FLAT IRON MY HAIR IT WAS COMING OUT RIGHT,. AND MY ENDS WOULD LOOK ALL FRIZZY, GLAD I PURCHASED THIS, EVERY NATURAL SHOULD OWN THIS..</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use this in tandem with my flat iron. It can give you a bit of static, but this has gotten my hair straighter than any other brush or comb I use with my flat iron. The bristles are hard, not a softer boar hair like bristle. You can only have so much hair in the brush at a time or it will negate the point of using it. I like the fact that the brush locks for easy storage. I have thick, natural, tightly coiled African American hair. I will say I do not like using this while blow drying, only  when my hair is dry.</li>
    <li> I love the brush!  I use it in my salon daily!  Makes straightening curly and wavy extensions easy! Love it!</li>
    <li> I owned one before and it lasted awhile until it was accidentally stepped on.&lt;br /&gt; I wanted the pink one this time but settled for the red and blask because it was a little cheaper. They sent me the pink one anyway! And my thick hair is a breeze to straighten!&lt;br /&gt; A must-have for anyone with wild hair!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This brush always locks when I close it as I am brushing. I struggle a lot with it, I cant brush comfortably when it locks each time!</li>
    <li> Very helpful with blow drying my hair.  My hair gets very straight with this tool.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, really good for curly thick hair. Extreme helpful when straightening or blow drying my hair</li>
    <li> i like the way it straightens my hair it dont give a strong press but it works for me  because i have afro  black hair but i cornrow my hair alot and i need it a little straight to get that length to braid i like to switch up from the comb nozzle on the blowdryer . i take that attachment off the dryer and use the diane straightening brush i like good price because in rite aide they charge $17.00</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my previous one for at least 6 years before it broke. I had this one for 3 months with only special occasions use, and it broke.</li>
    <li> Update June &#x27;16&lt;br /&gt;I still use this brush; however, I had to take off a star. The longer you use the brush, the more the color flakes off. I find myself using it a lot less now because of this. It&#x27;s pretty annoying to stop in pick out shiny pink flakes from your hair every few minutes. It still works well other than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have armpit length (stretched) natural hair with 4a-c coils all around my head. I used this to blow dry my hair straight and then used it in place of a comb for the chase method to flat iron. It was easy to use and it shortened a usually 3-4 hour procedure to a little over an hour. My hair looked like I had just walked out of the salon with a silk out. It even worked well on my little sisters texlaxed hair. I highly recommend this straightening brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent! I have very kinky coils (4a/4b), and this helps get my hair bone straight. It separates each strand of hair to allow proper application of the heat from the flat iron. My roots get extremely straight (people often ask if I&#x27;ve gotten a relaxer), the style lasts for a long time (saying a lot with this Georgian humidity!), and, best of all, it prevents scraggly ends. Straightening my hair has never been so easy!</li>
    <li> WITH A BLOW DRYER AND COCONUT OIL MY DAUGHTER HAIR WENT FROM FUZZY TO SILKY. I STILL NEED TO WORK ON HANDLING IT COUPLED WITH THE BLOW DRYER</li>
    <li> I love this brush, just using it while blowing drying it makes my hair bouncy and shiny, and using it with my flat iron makes my hair bone straight.love it.</li>
    <li> this really helps with blow drying my hair straight and eliminating frizz.  I liked it so much I got one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughters hair.  and I love it.  Use small parts when straightening hair</li>
    <li> AA female with 3c/4a hair. Straightened it far better than a blow dryer alone; however, it is more damaging too! I would suggest using this once in a while. Also, it&#x27;s not that easy to do, so make sure you section your hair in small portions and start with the areas of your head that have the most shrinkage. Overall, the product itself is superb. It&#x27;s the method itself that should be used sparingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m terrible at blow drying my hair straight  - this brush make it easy. It is very easy to use, requires no skill which is great for me - but the process is still tedious and takes way too long for me to do more than infrequently (but that&#x27;s on me, not the brush).&lt;br /&gt;(FYI, for the similarly clueless - you&#x27;re supposed to direct the blow dryer at the vents so that the hair in the grip dries straight).</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightening brush because I was not about to order the Conair Go Straight at $30.  That is absolutely ridiculous to charge that much for that brush.  I used to get the Conair Go Straight at CVS for $6.99 but for some reason, cannot find it anymore.  So when I was searching Amazon for the Conair, I was shocked at the price.  I found this one and purchased it.  It is ok.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the bristles come out.  This brush does not glide through the hair like the Conair one does but it will have to do because I will not pay $30 for a Conair brush.</li>
    <li> I thought it would help straighten my hair better, all it did was snag my hair. The bristles are rock hard, so if you have kinky, natural hair then  do not bother. I ended up using a regular boar bristle brush and got better results. Also, the construction of the brush is poor. The lock on the end makes it difficult to straighten hair. Just skip this and get a tension brush with softer bristles.</li>
    <li> Brush bristles are tight literally breaking and ripping my hair out.  I&#x27;m Afro-American not sure if this makes a difference (used when hair is straighten).  I&#x27;m not sure if this made for someone with extremely fine hair or extremely coarse hair.  Anyhoo, seems like something you would use on a horses mane.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Use with caution&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very nifty! Cut my flat ironing time down quite a bit. i also like that it&#x27;s black and pink and matches my flat iron!</li>
    <li> I love the idea. For my hair it made for a lot of static and did not&lt;br /&gt;work well for me. I have fine baby hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and probably&lt;br /&gt;would work better for another type of hair. I think the product is good!</li>
