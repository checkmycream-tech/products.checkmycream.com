      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Dual purpose massage cream from biotone and liked it a lot</li>

      <li>Packaging wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
      <li>I have no complaints except that it ran out quickly, so</li>
      <li>I first became familiar with this when my masseur here in the states used it.  </li>
      <li>I like to glide working my way into a deeper massage once the creme has been absorbed abit.</li>
      <li>The jar has a wide opening (as pictured) which gives it a good alternative.</li>

      <li>This product really helps with muscle pain.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I have not had good luck with the pump though once the lotion got down to half full.  </li>
      <li>First review;  Good spread-ability and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Was looking for something really moisturizing, but over the counter body butters work better than this and are alot less money.</li>
      <li>This is the only massage cream I&#x27;ve used that truely has no scent.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a little bit too watery, more like lotion than cream, and it dries away fast</li>
      <li>Decent lotion.</li>
      <li>This creme has a fragrance which is known to be toxic to humans.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a preservative that is highly toxic.</li>

      <li>This is like the cream the professional massage therapists use.</li>
      <li>I mostly have to reapply a lot which can be frustrating when giving a massage.</li>
      <li>It is easy on the skin, has little to no scent, and makes her hands and arms fatigue much less.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and rich and lasts for a long time.</li>
      <li>A little too much slip for a creme imo</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I personally prefer the dual purpose Biotone instead. This and the other was used at the massage school I went to and the dual purpose was used more because the consistency is a little thicker and creamier--A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bring this product with me when I travel and need a creme massage.  I first became familiar with this when my masseur here in the states used it.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and great for my skin.  Some of the products used in SE Asia cause a rash with me.  This creme is benign and conditions my skin beautifully.</li>
    <li> This cream has excellent glide and it checks up well for deep tissue work. It is slow absorbing as well, so it is cost efficient.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Really does wonders for my wife&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and the consistency of this massage cream. It sinks into the client&#x27;s skin. It provides glide for deep, effleurage strokes. Great product.</li>
    <li> Wife uses this all the time.  I like the way that the pump functions flawlessly.  Good for massages, too</li>
    <li> Decent lotion. Nothing fantastic.</li>
    <li> A little too much slip for a creme imo</li>
    <li> I love the creme and the smell. The price and the shape of the container not so much. It&#x27;s only 16 oz and the container is a short and fat.. I have to carry it around the table with me because it doesn&#x27;t fit in my handy dandy massage belt. Your better off buying 68 ounces for $46 then 16 ounces for $20. 16 ounces x 4 containers &#x3D; 64 ounces for $80. Just buy the 68 ounces for $46 you wont be mad about it! Now I just have to work on not using so much at a time. I like to glide working my way into a deeper massage once the creme has been absorbed abit.</li>
    <li> a must for any professional... !!</li>
    <li> This product really helps with muscle pain. It was recommended to me by my PT. He uses it on all his clients. Thank you Amazon for selling this product.</li>
    <li> Great hypoallergenic lotion for massage!  Glides easily and you don&#x27;t need a ton.</li>
    <li> stays moist through entire massage</li>
    <li> My Husband is a PT and he uses to help with my sore neck and arm muscles. Only complaint is the creme is slightly oily.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my beloved herbal select in a pump, only without the parabens  - this is too watery for my taste.</li>
    <li> This is the best massage cream I have ever used.  It is not greasy or oily.  A little amount goes a very long way.  It maintains its slipperiness well and you do not have to make repeat applications.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great massage cream. Sometimes the pump doesn&#x27;t do a great job getting the cream out. It&#x27;s easy to open the jar &amp; scoop out the cream by hand though. The jar has a wide opening (as pictured) which gives it a good alternative.</li>
    <li> IS EVERY THING A MASSAGE PRODUCT SHOULD BE.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Creme&amp;#34; is thin and watery.  First client reported an allergic reaction 24 hrs after session</li>
    <li> the cream it&#x27;s ok, no skin reaction yet and being using it for a week already everyday, it&#x27;s a little bit too watery, more like lotion than cream, and it dries away fast</li>
    <li> Love this in my massage work.</li>
    <li> First review;  Good spread-ability and a little goes a long way.  NO skin reaction on a highly sensitive person.  Followup review;  Dropped down to two starts as the skin reaction (itchy low level hives) resulted after I started using it several days in a rwo. If used on once every 3-4 days, no reaction.  Using 3 out of 4 days and starting getting area itching and breakout of low level (not large bumps) hives. If you have skin that is easily irritated, use caution with this product.</li>
    <li> Nothing in this cream to cause allergic reactions, goes on like cream but silky like oil and does not leave client all greasy at the end. The body just soaks it up. I have been using it for ten years and nothing else compares in my mind</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for those long massages. It is non-greasy and has long lasting moisture for smooth gliding across the skin. This is like the cream the professional massage therapists use. This cream is great and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but I keep coming back to Biotone Massage Cream.  I use it for Swedish and deep tissue massages, and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This creme is really good. It works well. The only problem is that I received a broken tub of creme.  It wasn&#x27;t packed well enough.</li>
    <li> I like the biotone lotion line... and I like the shorter tub and size of this bottle.  I have not had good luck with the pump though once the lotion got down to half full.  Maybe just this pump im not sure.  I will give it one more shot but will look elsewhere if I have the same issue</li>
    <li> This is not the same stuff I bought from the spa I went to. It has the same name but not the same at all. The smell is awful. It smells like mildew. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It works fine. I have no complaints except that it ran out quickly, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the 16oz size if you&#x27;re doing massage often.</li>
    <li> This creme has a fragrance which is known to be toxic to humans.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a preservative that is highly toxic. Stick to UNSCENTED NO PRESERVATIVE CREAMS AND OILS TO BE SAFE&lt;br /&gt;I HAD A REACTION TO BIOTONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the reactions to iodopropynyl butylcarbamate allergy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical allergic contact dermatitis may occur. It may take several days after exposure to the allergen for symptoms to appear. Typical symptoms include redness, swelling, itching, and fluid-filled blisters. Patients commonly present with a scattered generalized dermatitis or dermatitis affecting hands and arms.&lt;br /&gt;Another concern of iodopropynyl butylcarbamate is that it may have adverse effects on the immune system. It is also suspected to be an environmental toxin. Further research into these areas is necessary.</li>
    <li> perfect for massage work. I have worked for over 20 years in massage and this is the product my clients and I love because no fragrance and no stain</li>
    <li> lid was broken and cream coming out.</li>
    <li> Was looking for something really moisturizing, but over the counter body butters work better than this and are alot less money.</li>
    <li> I have chronic issues with back pain and muscle problems after a back injury.  My oldest daughter often will help me out with back massage as needed.  This stuff makes the job much easier on us both.  It is easy on the skin, has little to no scent, and makes her hands and arms fatigue much less.  She doesn&#x27;t have to work nearly as much using this product.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy slimy feel. I often just leave it on my skin when she&#x27;s done.  There is no odor or uncomfortable feel so I just let it be.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, not really the best cream I&#x27;ve used. I mostly have to reapply a lot which can be frustrating when giving a massage. Even with deep tissue work it dries out kind of fast. I&#x27;ve used the Dual purpose massage cream from biotone and liked it a lot but I ordered this because I was looking for something without almond oil in it for people with nut allergies. Will keep looking.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice lightweight easy glide cream that is great for lighter work like energy or Swedish, but would not recommend for Deep Conective Tissue or friction massage or Myofascial Release as it is quite slippery. Great for clients who don&#x27;t like fragrances.</li>
    <li> This is a really good massage cream. It works very well. Only problem is that I received a broken tub of cream. Packaging wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
    <li> Love this product and seller is fantastic</li>
    <li> This is the only massage cream I&#x27;ve used that truely has no scent. It&#x27;s a perfect product for sensitive skin, supreme workability, and best of all-a little goes a long way. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought this after my chiropractor&#x27;s office masseuse used it. Non greasy feel, you moisturized. Love the smooth feel and use it daily.</li>
    <li> I use it in my massage practice for both Swedish and deep tissue work. It&#x27;s thick and rich and lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t rub in to quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I always love Biotone products.  This is good for clients that have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! My massage therapist uses this in her shop. The smell is light and it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Been using this massage cream for years. Have sensitive skin &amp; have had no problem with this product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product glides across your skin.</li>
