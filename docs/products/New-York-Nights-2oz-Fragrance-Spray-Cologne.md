<li> Everything that I expected..</li>
<li> The base note of sandalwood and top notes of lavender..</li>
<li> If you are looking for this product, don&#x27;t be afraid if the package change the image, is the right one...</li>
<li> For an after shave that&#x27;s less than twenty bucks.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$$!!</li>
<li> If you purchased the Jordache Drakkar Noir No. 10 and thought it was horrible, you were right.  </li>
<li> Not the previous quality...looks like someone&#x27;s cutting corners somewhere!!</li>
<li> This smells nothing like the other ones I&#x27;ve purchased smells awful like I sprayed my son with a toxic insecticide!!</li>
