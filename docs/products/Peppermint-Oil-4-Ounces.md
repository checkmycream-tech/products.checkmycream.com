<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this peppermint oil six days ago.  I have lost eight pounds in six days.  I put a few drops in my water and drink peppermint water all day long.  I also rub grapefruit essential oil and lemon essential oil under my nose as an aromatherapy exercise to suppress appetite.  Drinking the peppermint oil causes my body to detox.  In the first three or four days of drinking the peppermint oil I had more acne and burped a lot by days three and four the burping subsided and my face is clear as a bell.  The best part is that I have no desire to graze on food all day as I was before.  I feel full and content.  I take a bite or two of my food and realize I don&#x27;t need the rest.  Every morning I wake up and get on the scale to be thrilled that the number is going down. This oil is extremely awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after I was told it deters mice. I sprayed some on the rug and near areas were mice were seen and I haven&#x27;t seen any since. It also smells great and the scent lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this at night in an atomizer or just put some on my wrist and take some deep breaths.  Peppermint is&lt;br /&gt;my favorite essential oil.  Put some on cotton balls in a drawer to keep the mice away, works as a deterrent.</li>
    <li> I use peppermint oil heavily in ths summer/sultry/humid months we have in the Bay Area when the silverfish, etc. come out. I put 5-6 dabs on a cotton ball or facial pad and set it on one of my pantry&#x27;s shelves.  Works great.  I find DEAD silverfish usually outside the door to the pantry. I&#x27;ve heard it works on mice, too. Knock on wood, none of THOSE yet.  I&#x27;ve begun to place more scented cotton balls around the house (where books and papers live) to save from the silverfish munching.  Gives a pleasant scent, too.  As ordered, and shipped well-packaged, no leakage, breakage, etc.  TERRIFIC product. ordered 2 -- one for a friend with creepy crawlies in Gold Country.</li>
    <li> I use this item on cotton balls in my camper to ward-off mice!  I use this in conjunction with other products, but feel it works!</li>
    <li> Recieved in a timely matter was wrapped very well.  Have not been able to use the product yet because of cleaning.  Would do business with again</li>
    <li> I purchase the PEPPERMINT OIL for the sole purpose of getting rid of Mice. It smells nice, but do no work. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I placed it in a burner, I put some in a spray bottle mixed with water, I placed it on cotton balls and placed them all around where I saw droppings. Nothing works, so don&#x27;t believe the story that it works.  It does not work.  Also quite costly to burn, and mop floors and place on cotton balls, just to get good smell in your home . I have tried everything.  These mice will not eat the food, will not touch the glue traps, will not touch the old fashion traps. They appear to be smarter than the people who make the food and the traps for them. Nothing works. They will destroy the toilet paper, but will not eat any brand of mice food we put down for them.</li>
    <li> I have been using the NOW peppermint oil for a couple years now, applying it to my front entrance door all year round as a great repellent for both mosquitoes, flies &amp; bees in summer, and mice &amp; spiders in winter, and so far it hasn&#x27;t let me down.  Just be sure you wear plastic gloves when you are applying it to protect your hands, then using either a cotton ball or paper towel, apply along the door baffle and the wood below it, all around the bottom sides of the door, then a little up on the bottom of the door (in summer, go higher and just douse a paper towel and rub lightly around the upper door too).

This is such a great, aromatic all-natural way to get rid of vermin, I wish I had known about it sooner but learned by googling it on the internet and reading websites &amp; testimonials.  Important: remember to reapply after it rains because it washes away.</li>
    <li> Bought this size to replace the 2oz. Oil is strong and smell last long after application. I use it on almost any and everything. As a cleanser, deodorizer.</li>
    <li> I purchased Peppermint Oil based on reports it would drive off rodents. It initially appeared to work but failed to continue to do so, even though it had been freshly applied. I guess the Nordic Gray&#x27;s got used to the product&#x27;s pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> Mice!  I was aghast.  I read where peppermint oil is a super deterrent to rodents.  I&#x27;ve got it in all my cabinets and have a nice smelling kitchen and no mice.  Of course, I did everything else imaginable to keep this situation from occurring again so I can&#x27;t swear to the peppermint being the answer to the problem, but it makes me feel good!</li>
    <li> I ordered the peppermint oil to help chase out mice.  I began to see improvement as soon as I started using it.  I would definitely recommend this oil to help get rid of mice!</li>
    <li> Like the product, has a pleasant peppermint smell, and was just right for the usage required of it.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I put cotton balls soaking with the peppermint oil all around the house where we had seen mice but they just pushed the cotton balls out of the way and came in. We caught them the old fashioined way with traps. :(</li>
    <li> I use this product to keep spiders away.  So far it has helped.  Found this on internet.  Will order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I HEARD THAT MICE DON&#x27;T LIKE PEPPERMINT WHICH IS FINE WITH ME, BECAUSE IT HAS MY WHOLE HOUSE ON ENTRANCE SPELLING LIKE A PACK OR SHALL I SAY SEVERAL PACKS OF GUM. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ALL OF THIS IS \\&quot;NO MORE MICKEY&#x27;S\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I hate it when you buy something and try to contact the company, only to have them TOTALLY ignore your requests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, Yahoo did come through and correct the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product but not the vendor</li>
    <li> i use a few drops in my moisturizer on my face a night and add a drop to my daily moisturizer. this stuff is strong, but amazing for your skin!</li>
    <li> It makes my house smell wonderful and I have not heard a bit of scratching at all. I am so pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I used it as a means to keep the mice away. Seems to be working great. Smells good too. Yes, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a month ago after reading up about peppermint oil and what it&#x27;s used for. I got it for mice, I&#x27;m aim arizona native now living in Baltimore and never had to deal with annoying mice. I placed about two drops on cotton balls and placed them around my home. After about a week i saw no mice nor traces of them. And my home smells so minty and fresh. It&#x27;s very strong though you only need a little. I plan on ordering more because I&#x27;m almost out.</li>
    <li> WOW...do I ever love this oil of Peppermint for candy mints. I also recently found out that peppermint repels mice. I buy it in the four ounce bottle, sprinkle some on a cotton ball and put into stored boxes in the garage and barn. Just be careful not to get any oil on painted or varnished surfaces. Your storage area will not only be more free of uninvited guests like mice but will smell like candy canes. Thanks for this NOW brand of peppermint, its nice. Shirley</li>
    <li> I bought this Peppermint Oil to control mice.  I mix this in a bit of  cheap cooking oil and soak cotton balls in it and place those around areas where we have seen evidence of mice. Mice hate the smell.  This oil has a strong fragrance which permeates the air when you open the cap.  Good stuff.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is good quality for the price, shipped very quickly and I will use this brand again. Strong scent!  I read that peppermint oil will work to repel mice from an outdoor shed.  I am sure It has much more pleasant uses, but I can endorse that it worked pretty well. It sure smells better than mothballs!!</li>
    <li> We use this in some of our massages.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing!!  The clients love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> The price was good, and it works beautifully to deter rodents. I cannot speak to any other attributes the oil may have.</li>
