      <li>The color was perfect.</li>
      <li>Its a beautiful color</li>
      <li>Pravana chromasilk is a great product.</li>
      <li>Perfect product, glad I found somewhere that I can buy it myself.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the pastel colors</li>
      <li>The pastels line is great for a first timer.</li>
      <li>Love these pastels.</li>
      <li>I have used many, many tubes of Pravana (vivids and pastels) and this lot of &amp;#34;Pretty in Pink&amp;#34; truly has no pigment.</li>
      <li>Make sure you follow the directions on the box.</li>
      <li>I did the application on the appropriate hair &#x27;canvas&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It was okay</li>
      <li>I love pravana</li>
      <li>More cotton candy colored than the color of the hair swatch</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll be able to use it to dilute a brighter color.</li>
      <li>Best pink I&#x27;ve used!</li>
      <li>and it was a huge mistake</li>
      <li>max wear time is 2wks using Pravana sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it&#x27;s easy to apply and, again, the color is great if you&#x27;re looking for a lighter shade of pink.</li>
      <li>true to color order two if u have lots of hair no need for conditoner on this one just the color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The swatch shown here is not an adequate representation of the color</li>
      <li>Faded too quickly.</li>
      <li>I had seen some youtube tutorials that used this color, and it&#x27;s nothing like the swatch in the color, but the color is still very pretty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all of the pastels (including pretty in pink) before with great results.</li>
      <li>so I could dye it fun colors over the summer.</li>
      <li>Pravana did it right.</li>
      <li>I previously used Pravana Chromasilk Vivids in blue, and it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>I have been buying this product for the past couple months and have had great results blending two tubes of this with conditioner and purple to get the shade I desire.</li>
      <li>Loved this color just as much as the other two I purchased.</li>
      <li>Pretty color when it stays.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, my highlights have lasted for 2 weeks now; I just need more Pravana for sometime in the next week or so.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I thought &amp;</li>
      <li>The color is not at all like the swatch but rather a nice muted pastel pink which was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I have mixed feelings about this dye.</li>
      <li>;) make SURE your hair is at a white or ashy color or this will turn an ornange color</li>
      <li>but this is the first time I habe ever haf any issues with pravana</li>
      <li>This is because, according to my hairdresser there are two formula - one is lighter and doesn&#x27;t work and one is darker and is absolutely perfect if you have a very light base.</li>
      <li>This is a true pastel pink- very muted and light.</li>
      <li>Second with sulfate free shampoo, faded after 3 washes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think that concoction took either, heh</li>
      <li>and it did absolutely nothing</li>
      <li>The color was not oxidized, I did not mix it with any developer (which the inside of the package states not to), so I really don&#x27;t know why the results were non existent.</li>
      <li>it is only going to work if your hair is incredibly light.</li>
      <li>so you know very well that there is no color coming off of it.</li>
      <li>I really like this color</li>
      <li>I have used many other colors before.</li>
      <li>Bought another tube from a professional beauty supply and it was much brighter!</li>
      <li>or if it&#x27;s this seller in particular but watch out because there truly is a difference.</li>
      <li>Price is decent.</li>
      <li>color went in and rinsed right back out.</li>
      <li>I ordered 3 of these thinking it would be the new formula</li>
      <li>my hair is certainly light enough, not nearly enough pigment.</li>
      <li>First faded after one wash wish regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t get it PURE white</li>
      <li>In order to get this to work I had to bleach my hair, tone it pure white</li>
      <li>I put this on today after the blue had completely faded out, and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Really, it comes out almost white &amp; does not develop into a deeper color, even after leaving it on for hours.</li>
      <li>I had been using Manic Panic Cupcake Pink dye, which I love, but I wanted to try the Pravana Pastels since I had used other colors in their Chromasilks Vivids line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be like me &amp; think that all of these other reviewers must not have gotten their hair light enough or were simply inept</li>
      <li>no pink stains on my skin or clothes (I was wearing an old white tshirt I planned on throwing out when I was done).</li>
      <li>I had  my hair professionally bleach blonde and this product didn&#x27;t set.</li>
      <li>This still wouldn&#x27;t stick in my near white hair.</li>
      <li>go get cotton candy pink by manic panic if you&#x27;re really looking to get this color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m naturally a bleachy blonde and this did NOTHING to my hair.</li>
      <li>the dye in the tube was so diluted that it was barely noticeable on my hair after leaving it sit for 4 hours.</li>
      <li>I saw no pink at all</li>
      <li>May last longer on natural hair.</li>
      <li>It was just too much work for very minimal results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so disappointed since I&#x27;ve been told such great things about this product.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m so disappointed since I&#x27;ve been told such great things about this product.</li>
<li> I would not recommend buying this product from anyone other than a professional supply.</li>
<li> but doesn&#x27;t want it to last to long.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t color my ordinary natural blonde hair, just my bleached-white highlights (</li>
<li> Putting pink on hair that&#x27;s been bleached to yellow is just going to make salmon.</li>
<li> Complete waste.</li>
<li> I mixed this with conditioner just to dilute it a little</li>
<li> Not even a hint of pink.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get the pastel pink</li>
<li> Granted, I didn&#x27;t bleach it, but it was so baby pink</li>
<li> Also i think the color gets prettier as it fades but my hair was toned to silver before i applied the pink</li>
<li> My natural color is like a dark dirty blonde, so I lightened it a bit first, but I was so disappointed, because I had done this just to dye it pink, and for it to only last 3 days, despite how much dye I had used (3 tubes).</li>
<li> Would recommend over other dyes.</li>
<li> My hairdresser has used this product on me twice - it worked once and didn&#x27;t work the other time.</li>
<li> You need to have very pale yellow whiteish hair</li>
<li> Didnt stick very well to bleached hair, and faded very quickly to a weird peach color.</li>
<li> Not worth your money.</li>
<li> No color washed down the drain....</li>
<li> but this dye has little to no pigment in it, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this particular seller or if Pravana has changed the formula, but something is seriously wrong with the pigmentation of this dye.</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> LAME do NOT waste your money with this one</li>
<li> Super disappointed.</li>
<li> The color was so pale</li>
<li> However, the past two times i purchased this product from this seller</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it lasted only about 3-4 days.</li>
<li> As a registered stylist I usually trust</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waist your money seriously.</li>
<li> Made my white hair have a bad flesh colored undertone.</li>
<li> Sad to have wasted my money, but you don&#x27;t need to make my mistake.</li>
<li> I even paid for same day shipping :(</li>
<li> This product was old or a very bad knock off.</li>

    <li> I initially tried this according to the instructions. I have white blonde hair. Nothing. Then For try two i left it on for four hours. Nothing. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s a pastel but this dye has little to no pigment in it, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I hate to pick &#x27;I hate it,&#x27; but let&#x27;s just say it did not change my hair color at all. Granted, I didn&#x27;t bleach it, but it was so baby pink I knew immediately it wouldn&#x27;t do anything. Instead I tried to use it to dilute my Pravana Vivids magenta. I don&#x27;t really think that concoction took either, heh</li>
    <li> My hairdresser has used this product on me twice - it worked once and didn&#x27;t work the other time. This is because, according to my hairdresser there are two formula - one is lighter and doesn&#x27;t work and one is darker and is absolutely perfect if you have a very light base. I ordered 3 of these thinking it would be the new formula and unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t....I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s random which one you get or if it&#x27;s this seller in particular but watch out because there truly is a difference.</li>
    <li> I have white hair and this did nothing to it. I&#x27;m so disappointed since I&#x27;ve been told such great things about this product. I emw</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be like me &amp; think that all of these other reviewers must not have gotten their hair light enough or were simply inept (I&#x27;m sorry I thought wrongly of you, fellow reviewers). My hair is a level 11 and this did nothing. I have used many, many tubes of Pravana (vivids and pastels) and this lot of &amp;#34;Pretty in Pink&amp;#34; truly has no pigment. Really, it comes out almost white &amp; does not develop into a deeper color, even after leaving it on for hours. I&#x27;ve used all of the pastels (including pretty in pink) before with great results. Sad to have wasted my money, but you don&#x27;t need to make my mistake. No filter on this photo, btw.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m naturally a bleachy blonde and this did NOTHING to my hair. Not even a hint of pink. Super disappointed. I even paid for same day shipping :(</li>
    <li> As a registered stylist I usually trust Pravana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by lightening my hair to a level 11. This still wouldn&#x27;t stick in my near white hair. I recommend their violet and magenta, but not the pastels at all.</li>
    <li> did not leave any color at all</li>
    <li> Not worth your money. It did nothing to my hair I saw no pink at all it looked like conditioner in a tube</li>
    <li> Worst color ever. Grabbed to random sections on level 10 hair. Left on for 10 extra minutes and it still did not grab. So faint it looks like a bleach job. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I really like this color but sadly it fading in one week. May last longer on natural hair. Price is decent.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stick to hair well at all. go get cotton candy pink by manic panic if you&#x27;re really looking to get this color.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Do not buy. I said DOES NOT WORK. I SAID DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Didnt stick very well to bleached hair, and faded very quickly to a weird peach color. Would recommend over other dyes.</li>
    <li> This product was old or a very bad knock off. The color was so pale it matched my bleached blonde hair. Bought another tube from a professional beauty supply and it was much brighter! I would not recommend buying this product from anyone other than a professional supply.</li>
    <li> Perfect product, glad I found somewhere that I can buy it myself.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with conditioner just to dilute it a little (it&#x27;s already pastel), applied it to my blonde hair, waited an hour, and it did nothing. I looked at my strands closely and the color hasn&#x27;t even binded into them. I then rinsed my hair and literally no color was left, except my hair was BRASSY ALL OVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Pravana chromasilk is a great product. I have used many other colors before. The pastels line is great for a first timer. Someone looking to try it but doesn&#x27;t want it to last to long. * max wear time is 2wks using Pravana sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. The Vivids line will last 4-6 wks</li>
    <li> Love these pastels. Pravana did it right.</li>
    <li> My hair was bleached to white before I put this color on. I left it on longer then recommended hoping the color would stick, but I should have known when squeezing the dye out of the tube that it wasn&#x27;t even going to tint my hair. Made my white hair have a bad flesh colored undertone. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Lasts through one shampoo and then fades dramatically.</li>
    <li> Loved this color just as much as the other two I purchased. I was very pleased with the pastel colors</li>
    <li> Faded too quickly. First faded after one wash wish regular shampoo. Second with sulfate free shampoo, faded after 3 washes.</li>
    <li> color went in and rinsed right back out. LAME do NOT waste your money with this one</li>
    <li> Last time I went to the salon I had my hairdresser bleach a section of my hair so I could dye it fun colors over the summer. I previously used Pravana Chromasilk Vivids in blue, and it worked perfectly. I put this on today after the blue had completely faded out, and it did absolutely nothing. I left it on for 45 minutes, checking at the 15 and 30 minute marks for change....nothing. It looked like conditioner when I washed it out. No color washed down the drain....no pink stains on my skin or clothes (I was wearing an old white tshirt I planned on throwing out when I was done). Complete waste.</li>
    <li> The color was perfect. Unfortunately, it lasted only about 3-4 days. I find that Manic Panic lasts a bit longer. On the plus side, it&#x27;s easy to apply and, again, the color is great if you&#x27;re looking for a lighter shade of pink.</li>
    <li> Best pink I&#x27;ve used! The color is not at all like the swatch but rather a nice muted pastel pink which was exactly what I wanted. Make sure you follow the directions on the box. Also i think the color gets prettier as it fades but my hair was toned to silver before i applied the pink so maybe that would be helpful to some of you. Putting pink on hair that&#x27;s been bleached to yellow is just going to make salmon.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for the past couple months and have had great results blending two tubes of this with conditioner and purple to get the shade I desire. However, the past two times i purchased this product from this seller the dye in the tube was so diluted that it was barely noticeable on my hair after leaving it sit for 4 hours. This is unacceptable, especially considering how obviously depigmented the tubes I&#x27;ve gotten have been. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this particular seller or if Pravana has changed the formula, but something is seriously wrong with the pigmentation of this dye.</li>
    <li> It was okay but the color didn&#x27;t stick like I thought it would.. You need to have very pale yellow whiteish hair</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get the pastel pink my hair is certainly light enough, not nearly enough pigment.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to to say it, but I hated this product- it did nothing to my hair- and my hair is bleached white. I had been using Manic Panic Cupcake Pink dye, which I love, but I wanted to try the Pravana Pastels since I had used other colors in their Chromasilks Vivids line.&lt;br /&gt;I waited until my pink was completely gone and my hair was white before I put this on and it did absolutely nothing but make my hair smell like hair dye. I have been a licensed cosmetologist since 1999 and I know I did the application on the appropriate hair &#x27;canvas&#x27;. The color was not oxidized, I did not mix it with any developer (which the inside of the package states not to), so I really don&#x27;t know why the results were non existent. I was just really disappointed with this product. Save your self the headache and chemical process and use a vegetable based line Manic Panic or Punky Colour instead of wasting any time or money on the Pravana Pastel line.</li>
    <li> In order to get this to work I had to bleach my hair, tone it pure white and then leave it in for several hours. If I didn&#x27;t get it PURE white it failed to stay at all. Pretty color when it stays. More cotton candy colored than the color of the hair swatch</li>
    <li> Its a beautiful color but this is the first time I habe ever haf any issues with pravana and it just didnt do what it was suppose to</li>
    <li> I had  my hair professionally bleach blonde and this product didn&#x27;t set. I left it in for 2 hours with a hair cap on.</li>
    <li> I feel so alone...and lucky!&lt;br /&gt;I adore this haircolor and this shade!  The first time I used it, I thought &amp;#34;This is just what I wanted!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The swatch shown here is not an adequate representation of the color--it&#x27;s not fuscia; it&#x27;s a soft, icy pink, a real pastel pink. It didn&#x27;t color my ordinary natural blonde hair, just my bleached-white highlights (which I&#x27;d planned).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my highlights have lasted for 2 weeks now; I just need more Pravana for sometime in the next week or so.</li>
    <li> true to color order two if u have lots of hair no need for conditoner on this one just the color. if you want to add conditioner you totally can just a tip from a hair stylist ;) make SURE your hair is at a white or ashy color or this will turn an ornange color</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THE PASTELS! There is no pigment in these dyes whatsoever! I ignored the reviews here and it was a huge mistake, they weren&#x27;t kidding. I tried it on nearly white hair and nothing happened at all.</li>
    <li> Did not color my hair at all, and I have nearly white hair. Terrible product, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any color at all..</li>
    <li> Color is not at all like the pictured swatch. This is a true pastel pink- very muted and light. it is only going to work if your hair is incredibly light. It&#x27;s not what I was looking for but I&#x27;ll be able to use it to dilute a brighter color.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I have mixed feelings about this dye. The color that came out was wonderful. I had seen some youtube tutorials that used this color, and it&#x27;s nothing like the swatch in the color, but the color is still very pretty. HOWEVER, the color only lasted about 3 days. My natural color is like a dark dirty blonde, so I lightened it a bit first, but I was so disappointed, because I had done this just to dye it pink, and for it to only last 3 days, despite how much dye I had used (3 tubes). Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be doing it again. It was just too much work for very minimal results.</li>
    <li> 0 stars......Don&#x27;t waist your money seriously. I should have read peoples comments before buying. I love pravana but this is one of there worst products. it looks the color of the Johnson Baby lotion so you know very well that there is no color coming off of it.</li>
    <li> it did not even stick to my hair</li>
</ol>
