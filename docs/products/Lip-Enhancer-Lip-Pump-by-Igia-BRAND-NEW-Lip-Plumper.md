### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>LOL.</li>
      <li>It has great suction and now I will never go without plump lips again.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with this device and can&#x27;t exist without it!  </li>
      <li>&quot; wouldn&#x27;t do anyone any good; it&#x27;s all trial and error.  </li>
      <li>Its made well and a good idea</li>
      <li>As another reviewer mentioned, it is very easy to bruise your lips with these pumps unless you have instructions to follow.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>If you need to, you can use it more often.  </li>
      <li>and I love the look that it has given my lips.</li>
      <li>There is a better design out there.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I just need more lessons.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>if im using it right can t seem to get a good suction,  going to try again</li>
      <li>It also has a strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>Glad to see this order wasn&#x27;t screwed up - don&#x27;t have time to play thinks - get it right on the dress!</li>
      <li>Make sure you take it easy the first couple of uses.</li>
      <li>This worked right out of the package!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get good suction with the bottom handle, so I just took it off and put one hand on the bottom and suck with my mouth to create the vacuum.</li>
      <li>I love this product and use it often particularly when going out.</li>
      <li>Just be gentle and pump lightly.</li>
      <li>Go to YouTube and watch video of talk show demonstration before using it so that you learn how to attach it with suction and don&#x27;t over do it at first.  </li>
      <li>Use it daily and you will be pleased.</li>
      <li>I will admit, I am a seasoned user</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>Finally a consumer friendly version of this product!</li>
      <li>This thing doesn&#x27;t even fit together snugly enough to creat suction!</li>
      <li>go with the real thing.  </li>
      <li>It will give an unusual sensation to your lips as they begin to respond to this suction \\&quot;pumping\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It really does work</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>You should really give it a try and follow the directions that you can find online.</li>
      <li>it covers my whole lower face</li>
      <li>First off, you must use some sort of cream or lotion around your lips so that you can get a tight, suction fit with this device.</li>
      <li>Once the results are achieved and you use this daily; you will have beautiful, full lips all the time (no need for expensive and regular injectables!)  </li>
      <li>so therefor it cannot create any suction as there are two huge air pockets on each side where lips should be if it where half the size.</li>
      <li>It should only be a mild bruise and use the lip pump only about twice a week until your lips have adjusted to this pressurized, \\&quot;expansion\\&quot; method of inflating the lips.  </li>
      <li>but wow who was this made for the joker?</li>
      <li>Bruising may occur; that&#x27;s only natural - and even occurs around injection points when collagen in professionally inserted into the line lip.  </li>
      <li>cheap and not effective.  </li>
      <li>Husband loves the plumped look and I love that they go back down for everyday look.</li>
      <li>I had slight bruising the first use, but didn&#x27;t realize I needed to work up to the totally plumped lips.</li>
      <li>PRESS the device up against your lips until you feel a \\&quot;fit\\&quot; forming; then gently begin to pull the \\&quot;pump\\&quot; back and forth towards and away from your lips while maintaining the tight, pressure around the lips (does this make sense?).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this because it was much less expensive than other ones on the market. It really does work and I love the look that it has given my lips. I am 48 and needed a little plumping as my lips have been thinning. Go onto youtube and type in how to use the Luscious Lips Plumper. This one doesn&#x27;t come with instructions. You have to lubricate the rubber band that is in the bottom half of the plumper or it won&#x27;t work. I didn&#x27;t know this until I went on youtube. Really works!</li>
    <li> workmanship was poorly designed.  It need another o-ring to help make  a tighter seal.  The effects are only temporary last only for about 1-2 hours.</li>
    <li> the lip enhancer arrived quickly, im not sure if im using it right can t seem to get a good suction,  going to try again</li>
    <li> This product Did not work at all, really was a waste of my money. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the buy.</li>
    <li> Did not work as described. Would not produce enough suction to plump lips. I would not recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy !!! Had 2 days and it broke !!. Paid 24 dollars for it and it&#x27;s junk . Would not buy . Save your money .</li>
    <li> cheap and not effective.  dropped mine and shattered into pieces.  not very impressed.  go with the real thing.  not this.</li>
    <li> Glad to see this order wasn&#x27;t screwed up - don&#x27;t have time to play thinks - get it right on the dress!</li>
    <li> This is a knock off and an infringement of our copyrighted and trademarked product, Luscious Lips Lip Pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not allow them to continue to CONFUSE THE BUYING PUBLIC. They have copied our words, our design, the color and have violated all rules of copyright and trademark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This act is a travesty!</li>
    <li> Its made well and a good idea but wow who was this made for the joker? Its so big (literally 4 inches wide) it covers my whole lower face so therefor it cannot create any suction as there are two huge air pockets on each side where lips should be if it where half the size. They really need to make these a realistic size and then maybe have at least 3 sizes to choose from starting at 2 inches wide and up.</li>
    <li> This does not seal properly to create suction. It is defective. I am returning it. I am very disappointed. I should not have purchased a generic version of this product. It also has a strong chemical smell. No instructions.</li>
    <li> I think that I have reviewed this before.  I love it but there were no directions.  Go to YouTube and watch video of talk show demonstration before using it so that you learn how to attach it with suction and don&#x27;t over do it at first.  Use it daily and you will be pleased. If you need to, you can use it more often.  Just be gentle and pump lightly.</li>
    <li> This design did not work for me. Impossible to get a &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; seal around lips to pull them out. There is a better design out there.</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t even fit together snugly enough to creat suction! I don&#x27;t know how these things can b tested before they r sold but the one I got is useless</li>
    <li> The lip pump that I received from this seller DOES NOT EVEN WORK (No suction effect on the lips), and did not come with any instructions OR sealed, as promised. As another reviewer mentioned, it is very easy to bruise your lips with these pumps unless you have instructions to follow.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with the purchase. Also, I believe this product is a knock off, and NOT Igia brand as stated in this posting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M LITERALLY GOING TO PUT THIS PUMP IN THE GARBAGE!!! ANYONE WANT TO BUY IT?? LOL.</li>
    <li> I have searched for a long time for an alternative to another more expensive product that I have had to replace yearly. Finally a consumer friendly version of this product! It really works. It has great suction and now I will never go without plump lips again. This worked right out of the package! I will admit, I am a seasoned user so I had no issues at all. If you find you are not getting suction, use one hand to hold at the very base firmly in place and the other hand to pull.</li>
    <li> You should really give it a try and follow the directions that you can find online. Would totally buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it often particularly when going out. It works and I usually will seal the deal by using a liquid lip plumper as well to follow up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  Yes, it is tricky to use and must be done properly in order for it to work.  \\&quot;Instructions\\&quot; wouldn&#x27;t do anyone any good; it&#x27;s all trial and error.  Once the results are achieved and you use this daily; you will have beautiful, full lips all the time (no need for expensive and regular injectables!)  First off, you must use some sort of cream or lotion around your lips so that you can get a tight, suction fit with this device. PRESS the device up against your lips until you feel a \\&quot;fit\\&quot; forming; then gently begin to pull the \\&quot;pump\\&quot; back and forth towards and away from your lips while maintaining the tight, pressure around the lips (does this make sense?).  It will give an unusual sensation to your lips as they begin to respond to this suction \\&quot;pumping\\&quot;.  Bruising may occur; that&#x27;s only natural - and even occurs around injection points when collagen in professionally inserted into the line lip.  Once your lips have \\&quot;adjusted\\&quot; to this procedure (after about 2 weeks of usage) the bruising will stop.  It should only be a mild bruise and use the lip pump only about twice a week until your lips have adjusted to this pressurized, \\&quot;expansion\\&quot; method of inflating the lips.  I am thrilled with this device and can&#x27;t exist without it!  Hope this review helps...</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get good suction with the bottom handle, so I just took it off and put one hand on the bottom and suck with my mouth to create the vacuum. It definitly works. Make sure you take it easy the first couple of uses. I had slight bruising the first use, but didn&#x27;t realize I needed to work up to the totally plumped lips. Husband loves the plumped look and I love that they go back down for everyday look.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what I am doing wrong but it works I just need more lessons. My friends want to know how to use it and they are anxiouse to try it themselves.</li>
    <li> Its very hard to actually make it work, but once you find a way its kind of painful, leaves bruises around lips, and it also only last about 10 mins.</li>
