      <li>Great, lightweight and fast!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
      <li>I bought Gelish brand foundation, top coat and neutralizer and OPI gel polish.  </li>
      <li>I used gellish polish with the foundation coat, polish, then top it off</li>
      <li>Used to take me an hour or more to do my nails</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t end up spending 3-4 times the amount on a nail lamp because this lamp gets the job done well at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if 2 min would cure them in this lamp.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They would look perfect but white lines/patches/mottled areas that were not on my nail before application or after</li>
      <li>I guess her thumb was positioned more towards the side of the lamp instead of</li>
      <li>so glad I decided to get the LED.  </li>

      <li>I love this lamp.</li>

      <li>I love being able to do this at home.</li>

      <li>favorite feature is the automatic sensor that knows when your hand is in there.  </li>
      <li>as well love the both of them  one for Shellac and one for Orly Fx Gel</li>
      <li>It works as described: 3 timers, automatically lights when your hand goes into the unit.  </li>
      <li>Love the three time settings.</li>
      <li>I chose this lamp because I&#x27;ve seen this brand before in a nail salon, so I researched it some more</li>

      <li>Fast, great light, easy to operate!</li>
      <li>This product works but it is not of great quality, but can&#x27;t expect high quality at this price.</li>
      <li>The light is bright and cures my nails quickly.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s easy to put all 5 fingers in without touching the sides.</li>
      <li>This has been wonderful to have such a lasting beautiful gel polish and the bonus is it lasts longer than you need.  </li>
      <li>now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Overall pleased with this purchase. I wanted an LED light that would cure one entire hand or foot (not messing with doing thumbs separately!) and this one easily fits the bill. Has done a good job on curing so far, though I&#x27;ve only had it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have noticed that the timer does keep cycling automatically sometimes. I will set it for 30 sec, it beeps when the time is over, but the light continues if the hand remains in the dryer for a split second after the beep. The light does turn off at the end of the cycle if no hand or foot is in the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a huge problem if you&#x27;re paying attention, but might be an issue for professional manicurists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will add that Thermal Spa had the best price on LED lamps--much less expensive than, say, OPI or Gelish versions, but TS works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: have used the dryer for several months now. Users will need to use the 60 second setting for any polish, no matter how light, for each layer, if they want the polish to stick for more than a day or two. otherwise, the polish will peel off within 2 days. Cure times for this light are longer than what I have read about for other LED lights.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this nail dryer because it is large enough to comfortably fit my whole hand without touching the sides and it dried the gel polish quickly, but the unit is defective so it doesn&#x27;t always turn off after the required number of seconds. Usually it would turn off on the 10 second setting, but it never turned off on the 60 second setting and the 30 second setting was hit or miss at least 50% of the time. I initially planned to return and order another just like it, but I decided to read the reviews for it and saw where someone had given it 4 stars in spite of their unit also having a defective timer. [Lesson learned: Don&#x27;t just look at how many stars an item has; check what people say about it too.] A second dryer with the same issue makes me think the odds of getting another defective unit are too high so I opted for another brand. Too bad, it would have been great otherwise.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this and after using it, I am very pleased. I wanted a quality product. It is sturdy and works very well. The only thing I was concerned with is that a lot of reviews said it turns back on after the timer goes off. But I think I figured this out! In the middle of the front, is the sensor. If your hand is in very far and covering the sensor when it goes off, it triggers it again. I didn&#x27;t have any problems when I only put my fingers in and made sure the sensor was between my fingers and not covered. It&#x27;s wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> As I was using the dryer at first was working properly. The light is supposed to switch on automatically when you put your hand in and should automatically turn off when the timer is done, but there seems to be some glitches because the light would not turn off when the timer was done. You can hear the click of when the timer is done but the light would just keep going.</li>
    <li> This is a good investment to save time and money by doing my gel manicures at home. The only problem with this product is that it often misses the mark with the timing feature. Instead of turning off at the 10, 30 or 60 second time frame it just keeps cycling through. It goes off for a millisecond and turns right back on.</li>
    <li> It works great!! I love it! I would reccomend this lamp to any body because its truly a great lamp.</li>
    <li> this is the first dryer I have bought so the only thing I have to compare to was my expectations.  I have used it 4 times now and LOVE it!  Its large enough to comfortably put my hand in the unit and I dont have small hands.  It works perfectly, you can change the settings with just a touch on top of the unit.  I use 10 seconds for the first two coats then up it to  30 seconds for the rest.  When you put your hand in, it automatically turns on which is great when your doing your own manicure or pedi.  I would totally buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great, lightweight and fast!</li>
    <li> Quickly dries the gel polish. Love the three time settings. Automatically shuts off when the time is up so there&#x27;s no guessing if you kept your hand in long enough or not.</li>
    <li> Good quality and perfect delivery time . It though to be useable to gel product but it isn&#x27;t. Only good for gel polish . The UV gel nails required a uv bulbs - 365 nm frequency spectrum - long wave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 2wks and so far I&#x27;m happy with the light. It cures well. The only minor issue is the automatic sensor is easily engaged if u move your hand while its under the light and the timer starts again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive way to do my own nails.  This nail dryer is easy to use and performs beautfully.  I would recommend this to all my money saving mommas</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, dries fast and works great with all my LED polish. I know some people complained about the timer not working and this lamp not shutting off right away or whatever but every time I have used this it has worked flawlessly. As long as you use this correctly then it should give you no problems!</li>
    <li> Love it very professional, I use it just for me.  Have a UV lamp as well love the both of them  one for Shellac and one for Orly Fx Gel</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to buy a nail lamp for the longest time because I despise going to the nail salon and I&#x27;ve always done my own manicures with regular polish. The LED lamp seemed the best way to go in my opinion since you don&#x27;t have to replace the bulb ever. I chose this lamp because I&#x27;ve seen this brand before in a nail salon, so I researched it some more and it turns out to be a decent lamp for the price. I&#x27;ve been using Gelish brand polish and it has been working great. I cure each coat for 90 seconds to 2 minutes depending on how thick the coat ends up being. This seems to be just the right amount of time because my polish stays perfect for about 2 weeks. I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t end up spending 3-4 times the amount on a nail lamp because this lamp gets the job done well at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> The settings are super easy to figure out and if you simply slide your hand in and out it works perfectly! I did my daughters nails and then mine, our nails cured perfectly! It&#x27;s very light so if you need to move around it&#x27;s not an issue. The light is extremely bright, I do not recommend looking in it when you are doing your nails (my daughter was facinated with that but I had to tell her to not stare inside of it while on). Arrived well packaged and quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this lamp. I did a lot of research on the UV vs LED lamps and I made the right choice by going with this one. Some of the reviews complained about this one turning on by itself or not shutting off when it was supposed to and I&#x27;ve had neither of these problems. I would reccomend this lamp for anyone that&#x27;s interested in at home gel manicures!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to gel polish and LED curing, and I&#x27;m very happy with this light and the small investment it represents. Works well, all nails seem to get equally exposed with all of the reflective surfaces inside. Seems sturdy. Only downside, and I saw others made this comment before I purchased: Sometimes when it goes off after the programmed amount of time, it comes right back on for another cycle. Happens more on the 10 second than 30 second program. Happens about 40% of the time.</li>
    <li> This has a ton of bulbs and works great. Plus, I&#x27;ve seen this used in nail salons. I&#x27;ve used it three times now and every time it has worked great.</li>
    <li> Is an excellent product!!! I love it. You can get in your hand perfectly and dry the enamel very fast.</li>
    <li> Fantastic value and works great.  I highly recommend this as it is just like the expensive salon lamps.&lt;br /&gt;5 Star product!</li>
    <li> works great and is fun to use.  Rather large size, but it&#x27;s easy to put all 5 fingers in without touching the sides.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently gone the way of gelish nail polish and decided that I could save myself some money and do my own nails.  I bought this LED nail dryer and some gelish polish ........ and from the first time I used them, my nails have looked like they were done in the salon.  This LED nail dryer is large enough for your whole hand to fit in, but I do my fingers first and my thumb separately.  You can set it for 10, 30, or 60 second drying time.  I do the base coat and 2 layers of gelish nail polish on the 30 second setting and for the top coat, I put my nails in the LED nail dryer for 60 seconds.  If I use a darker gelish nail polish, I put my nails in the LED nail dryer for 60 seconds for both coats/layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED nail dryer is also automatic ..... once you turn it on, all you have to do is insert your fingers and it automatically comes on and shuts off according to what setting you chose (10, 30,60 seconds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of the LED nail dryer is the equivalent of 2 nail salon visits ............ I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth out of it.  I can&#x27;t begin to add up how much money having my own LED nail dryer will save me .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second nail light from this company. I have been very satisfied with both. I can get my nails done so much faster with this one.</li>
    <li> We waited to review this until we had used it a few times because some of the reviews were not great. So far, so good for us. It has already paid for itself by saving us the cost of pedicures and if you follow all the steps, it will last until your nails have grown out enough that you really NEED to redo it. I love being able to do this at home.</li>
    <li> I initially started out with a UV light that was big enough for two hands to go in it at one time which was nice but i found that I usually did only one hand at a time anyway so having it extra large was useless. Plus my old light took up to 2min to cure the Gelish nail polish, which doesn&#x27;t seem long but the time adds up with each coat.&lt;br /&gt;So eventually I set out to find a new light that could cure a little quicker and I found this amazing product which is an LED light which is wayyy better then a UV light!! I could not be happier! It is built well, looks nice, is small enough to put away without a problem, and comes with three options for the timer: 10, 30, and 60 seconds. I use the Gelish nail polish and I always set my LED light to 30 seconds and my nails are perfectly cured EVERYTIME! It has saved me soooo much time! I also LOVE the fact this light has a sensor that when you put your hand into the machine the light automatically turns on to the time that you selected. One great thing about the sensor is that since you don&#x27;t have to touch the machine with wet nails to turn it on you dont end up ruining the top of the machine like I did with my last one that was covered with polish and scuffed up from alcohol. Also, when your done with the unit their is a master on/off switch on the back of the machine you you can leave it plugged in all the time if you choose to. If you refuse to pay $30 everytime you get your shellac nails done like I do then doing them yourself is the way to go and this light will make them perfect and do it quickly!!&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I also use the gel builders with this machine and it cures wonderfully each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 4/2/2015&lt;br /&gt;This little light is still going strong and I&#x27;m still loving it!! I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price.  It was larger than anticipated and has done a great job thus far on my nails. The only drawback I see are the bulbs. It does not appear that you can replace the bulbs??</li>
    <li> It works with light colors but dark ones don&#x27;t cure well. Thumbs have to be placed in separately or they don&#x27;t cure at all.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Works great!! Just as described. Very happy with my purchase. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this lamp if you ever use or plan to use builder or hard gels. I could not get good performance with either 30 seconds or up to 90 seconds with builder or hard gels. They would either fail the next day, cracking and peeling. Or there would be white lines in the polish a few hours after curing. They would look perfect but white lines/patches/mottled areas that were not on my nail before application or after were there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My application and prep is meticulous and confirmed correct with Gelish themselves in the steps that I take. So my problem is the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gelish hard gel is a 30 second cure in a 36 watt LED lamp, the time is 2 min in a UV lamp-while, I haven&#x27;t gone 2 min, I&#x27;ve stopped at 90 seconds (the max recommended by this lamp)-it does not perform like a regular LED lamp, more like a UV. I do not want a UV lamp, and do not want to go longer. I&#x27;m not even sure if 2 min would cure them in this lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...for regular Gelish soak off (not hard gel/file off), at 30 sec cure time (or as directed for your polish), I have had no issues and get a good 2 weeks of wear and they are on there good and hard to remove even with soaking with pure acetone for 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;So, I do know how to prep and apply, or I couldn&#x27;t get those results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF, you get this lamp-it may or may not work for you-even on soak off, regular gel nails and polish. So you are taking a gamble, be warned that if you ever go to hard gel nails, it won&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great Gel Nail Dryer for the money would recommend this dryer if your not sure you want to use Gel Nail Polish.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how large this unit was. Definitely fits your whole hand or foot. The only thing is it is not as quick to dry as I was hoping, it has settings for 10, 30, 60 and I find I have to do 2- 60 second sessions per hand for it to be dried and I also found that if I lifted my hand up closer to the lights it worked better. Just to much space between where your hand lays and the lights. I was trying to go the less expensive route and I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> This Thermal Spa LED light works great!  dries nails quickly and is easy to use.  I am very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I had only had my nails done twice at a salon with soak off polishes.  I had my doubts it was working the first time since it still seemed not dry after each Light session.  You need to wait until the last step when you wipe off with the cleanser for the hardened polish to be evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to do BOTH hands at the same time!  I simply apply to both hands and then stack and spread my fingers.  It works great because there is a wide opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have two concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: Skin damage long term from the lights - so I will wear my fingerless sun protection gloves with this in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: Light does come out of the wide opening and this light can damage your eyes.  I plan to take a folded piece of aluminum foil and tape to the top over the opening, making a flap like the top of the line Gelish until that costs much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the convenience and saving of doing my nails at home!!!  I have VERY thin nails that never help regular polish even one day.  This has been wonderful to have such a lasting beautiful gel polish and the bonus is it lasts longer than you need.  I generally redo every week and a half because the regrowth starts showing by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An product I ordered and enjoy to work with this are: VIP Beauty Shop 200 Pieces Nail Polish Foils with the cotton attached,  I have reused them 3 times and will do so until they fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Also took the remover  Super Nail Pure Acetone Polish Remover 235 Ml  and put it in a spray bottle as it is easy to spill.  Now I just give 1 -2 sprays onto the above foils that are preformed do to being reused.  I pop my fingers in and find I SAVE A LOT OF TIME as well as $$ by reusing them.</li>
    <li> I did A LOT of research on gel nail polish and LED lamps VS UV and realized I needed an LED...so glad I decided to get the LED.  This brand was the most economical for the size and wattage...I have used it twice and played with the automatic timer several times.  I works fine, cures gelish polish quickly, does my entire hand, including thumb all at once.  Fantastic  product!!!</li>
    <li> Started doing my own gel nails this year.  This is a great tool.  So fast and I like that it is not UV and hurting my hand.  I like that my whole hand fits.</li>
    <li> I have had this lamp for a few months now and it has been reliable. I own several brands of gel polish and have had no problems curing any of them. That said, I normally do my thumbs separately, but when I painted a co-workers nails, her thumb did not cure properly and the polish wiped off with alcohol. I guess her thumb was positioned more towards the side of the lamp instead of the top.&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY like that the lamp comes on automatically when you insert your hand/ foot. As another reviewer mentioned, just slide your hand out when finished (do not pick it up) to keep from activating the timer again. There is also a power button located on the back of the unit, so don&#x27;t forget to switch that on before you get started.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this.  I got it as a gift but I had researched the item before putting it on my birthday wishlist.  I read the review on how to use correctly and she is absolutely correct.  This does hold your whole hand easily and is nicer than some salons use.  The timer works perfectly.  If you put your hand back in immediately, the light will come back on for another 10, 30 or 60 seconds depending on what you had set it for.  I&#x27;ve only used it for dark colors since this is Fall  and you need to make sure you are using the gel cleanser to clean the tacky off your finish.  It cures beautifully.  My nails are gorgeous and it&#x27;s practically already paid for itself and I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
    <li> Bought this LED light to do at-home gel manicures. I used gellish polish with the foundation coat, polish, then top it off but each coat takes at least 2 minutes under the light. I was not able to use the recommended times on the box or on the gellish polish. It works, just takes much longer to fully dry the polish than it would at the salon. It also doesn&#x27;t have a fan.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my nail gal for her Christmas present.</li>
    <li> Works great and saves me money!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Granddaughter. She said she liked it. My nail person told me to get this kind  so picked from the reviews</li>
    <li> This gel dryer is a steal.  I hadn&#x27;t realized half the features it came with, and is very well designed.  I can fit an entire hand inside, and don&#x27;t have to waste time drying thumbnails separately.  It&#x27;s MUCH larger than I expected...which may be a downside for some.  I can easily fit my hand and whole wrist inside, or 1 1/5 hands if I was really pressed for time while drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature is the automatic sensor that knows when your hand is in there.  You simply press one of the button time selections at the beginning, and it stays selected; which means no more accidentally getting polish on the outside of a nail dryer and smudging up the buttons.  Really clever dryer for the $$.</li>
    <li> Not complete dry gel polish</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this LED lamp!  I&#x27;m new to doing gel nails at home and this is a must have for me!  Works exactly as advertised and the best part...it&#x27;s automatic!  You stick your hand in and it comes on.  It&#x27;s a little temperamental on the 10s setting, meaning sometimes it resets before I get my hand out, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this dryer, she uses it daily in a professional salon and it works great. Performance easily equals one costing several times more.</li>
    <li> Well priced, you can fit one whole hand including thumb, brand new and works great.</li>
    <li> I can do my own gel nails at home now!!  I got the OPI starter kit the same day. My nails look great and I am going to save so much $$$ over going to the nail salon. Took me 15-20 min to do a self-manicure and 4 gel coats (base coat, 2 color, and top coat).  This cures my OPI gel polish layers in only 30 seconds.  The LED technology is much better than regular UV lights that take 60 seconds or more to cure. It is a good size with reflective inner walls so your thumb does not have to cure separately. So far, it seems to be a sturdy and well-built machine.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve starting using this led light, I&#x27;ve had several clients return for gels chipping &amp; not lasting more than a week. Very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Fast, great light, easy to operate!</li>
    <li> Great purchase, I&#x27;ve been saving so much money doing my own nails. Mine has been working great i put it on 60 seconds for all the coats and my nails are done like a saloon.</li>
    <li> I love this LED lamp!!! Love love love it!!! Works awesome it is flawless. There is nothing wrong with the timer it works perfectly. It&#x27;s the person using it that&#x27;s not using it correctly. The timer has 3 settings, 10, 30, n 60 sec. Set the timer on what you want n SLIDE your hand in, keeping it laying flat on the bottom until your whole hand is in, the lamp will come on automatically as soon as you put your hand in. When the timer goes off DO NOT pick your hand up, keep it laying on the bottom and slide it out. This will keep the timer from resetting and coming back on. The timer sensor is located on the inside roof of the lamp at the entrance, so if you pick your hand up to take it out your getting into the sensor zone and that will reset the timer and it will come back on. When I need to cure for 2 to 3 minutes I set the timer on 60 and just lift the palm of my hand enough to reset the timer to go another 60 sec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the people who are saying that it doesn&#x27;t dry/cure their gel polish completely, they are either NOT curing it long enough and or they are not wiping the tacky residue off with either the gelish cleanser or alcohol wipe \\&quot;lint free\\&quot; DO NOT touch nails until you do that final step. You might think it will ruin your mani but it doesn&#x27;t, it sets it, and your nails are completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my manicure routine for gel polish n regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Remove all cuticles, I use Sally Hansen \\&quot;instant cuticle remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down. After applying this I soak my hands in some warm soapy water leaving the remover on for about 3-5 minutes n than I use a spoon metal cuticle pusher to push back my cuticles n remove the cuticle that has grown on my nail plate all the way around my nail, sides included  do not cut your cuticles or the skin around your nail plate, that&#x27;s what causes them to split and become callus. Should NEVER touch any of the skin around your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash hands good to remove all the cuticle remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I use my electric nail file/drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail n any remaining cuticle on the my nail plate only. This does not damage the nail plate n by using the E file it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail. I will NEVER use a block buffer or file on my nails ever again. Since giving up the buffer n file and using the E file only, my nails n the skin around my nail plate has never been healthier. There is a video on YouTube on how to do a proper manicure prep before applying gel polishes n regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Shape nails with a OPI crystal file, filing in one direction only. Do not file side to side this will only rip your nails and do not file the sides of your nails at all, this weakens the nails support causing them to break. Tips only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I use a brush or nail duster to remover the nail dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I apply 91% alcohol, let air dry than I use EZ flow nail primer being careful not to get any on the skin as it does burn, let air dry than I apply the gelish ph bond air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to gel polishes is very thin coats, keeping the foundation, color n top it off sealer off your skin if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it so alway check all nails good before curing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply a very THIN coat of gelish foundation, cure in LED lamp for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Take a dry paint brush that u would use for applying nail polish or makeup not the ones for removing the dust n wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture. I got this tip off the gelish web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Apply a very thin coat of the gel polish color you have picked out n cure for 1 minute, 2 minutes for dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Apply another coat of your color, again cure but I cure the second coat for 2 to 3 minutes depending on how dark it is, if u are gonna apply a 3rd coat only cure 2 mins n cure your 3rd coat 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer. I usually put 2 coats of this on curing the first coat 2 minutes n curing the second coat for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well and wipe each nail down good removing the tacky residue, never use anything cotton with your gels or regular polish it&#x27;s your worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.in cure but I cure the second coat for 2 to 3 minutes depending on how dark it is, if u are gonna apply a 3rd coat only cure 2 mins n cure your 3rd coat 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer. I usually put 2 coats of this on curing the first coat 2 minutes n curing the second coat for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well and wipe each nail down good removing the tacky residue, never use anything cotton with your gels or regular polish it&#x27;s your worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
    <li> Just as expected, this nail dryer is terrific.  It arrived sooner than expected, so I was able to try it out right away.  I bought Gelish brand foundation, top coat and neutralizer and OPI gel polish.  I decided to try the 10 second drying time recommended on the polish bottles, and it dried perfectly.  One more usage and it will have paid for itself.  Now I just have to get more practiced at manicuring my own hands!</li>
    <li> Used this about 10 times already.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I have the &amp;#34; Gel-ish&amp;#34; brand. Im  not sure how long I actually have to cure my nails for. Most of the time it ends up smudging maybe because its not drying properly. but overall a good product. I prefer this then paying 30-40 on a simple gel manicure at a nail salon, that uses harmful uv. LED is way better for your skin</li>
    <li> It works as described: 3 timers, automatically lights when your hand goes into the unit.  Larger than expected but so worth it; first light purchased elsewhere was very small, no timer and could only put 3 or 4 fingers in at a time.</li>
    <li> Once again it takes too long to ship! This product works but it is not of great quality, but can&#x27;t expect high quality at this price.</li>
    <li> The auto turn on is a bit sensitive, and you can turn it back on if you aren&#x27;t careful when you pull your hand out past the sensor. The light is bright and cures my nails quickly. It fits my whole hand no problem, and I am not a petite woman. I definitely recommend this light!</li>
    <li> It works perfect.I have got couple lamps before and wasn&#x27;t happy with results.But this one works fast and nice+just love it</li>
    <li> I have had this for a couple of months now. It works great. I love it.  I also love that you can get all of your nails in at one time I purchased a mini light before I got this one. I returned the mini and got this one and it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and had decided to buy this unit because it said it was 18watts. Well, it&#x27;s not, on the back of the machine is states that it is only 10watts. I&#x27;m highly disappointed. It does NOT cure gels at all. I&#x27;m sending this back with a big frown.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure in 30 seconds like it says it should. I have a lot of problems with it.</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift and have heard of no problems. I think she is very pleased. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon, and some nail blogs.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Love the auto timer and that I can put my entire hand or foot in to cure.  I had a OPI gel done in a salon and I think this is as good as the OPI LED light, and CHEAPER!  I love doing my nails, and even do my friends now.</li>
    <li> Fantastic unit. Very easy to use with great results</li>
    <li> Good size, works well, a friend has had the same model for 8 months with no problems.</li>
    <li> I had to come back again - I love my lamp.  If you have doubts about purchasing this one...wait no longer as it is excellent.</li>
    <li> Why would anyone use a UV lamp when they can buy a lamp like this and cure their gel polish in 30 seconds!  WHAT A TIME SAVER!  Used to take me an hour or more to do my nails and now I&#x27;m less than 30 minutes!  Just make sure your gel polish is LED compatible!  Great lamp at an amazing price!</li>
    <li> My wife loved her gift. It really works as advertised</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp and my polish begins to lift after a week. It&#x27;s only 10 watts and not a strong enough wattage for long lasting results. Do not buy!!</li>
