    <li> I love this brush…i saw it on the sigma website one day and had to order!!! I use it on my lower lid before I get to the crease…it deposits color very well because the bristles are stiff but still soft. It&#x27;s also perfect for a &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; eye!!! Love it!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Awesome brush for my wife.</li>
    <li> The sigma brushes are wonderful, the finishes of the shadows and application of blush and powder is fantastic. The brushes are very soft and fluffy. I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever brushes good, the best is even Sigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time. What is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love for the products of Sigma.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way, great seller,</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush!</li>
    <li> My favorite short shader.. so perfect and nice bristles.</li>
    <li> I just recently (last 3 months) began purchasing &amp; using Sigma brushes and I have yet to not love one of them! I have a very small eyelid and they are hooded, this brush allows me to really concentrate color on the lid and create a \\&quot;crease\\&quot; that I don&#x27;t normally have. It&#x27;s also great for smudging color on the upper &amp; lower lash lines. The bristles are packed tightly and the brush handle (as with all Sigma brushes) is easy to hold and easily apply your makeup. I love my Sigma brushes, this is my honest opinion, not for a gift, etc. I highly recommend them if you have never used decent makeup brushes and they&#x27;re very affordable!! Thanks Sigma &amp; Amazon :)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve bought many make up brushes over the years- this one is amazing - great quality for a decent price...the brush is very soft and defined so applying is easy and no extra eyeshadow falls on to your face. I will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional~am just learning more about how to use my cosmetics and developing techniques.  I have been following a YouTube site~Sigma brushes are used so I thought I would give them a try.  They work great for me.</li>
    <li> At first wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it but after getting more comfortable with it and learning how to better use it I really like this brush!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but this is my favorite brush. I love it for smoking my lower eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this to smudge eyeliner and have been happy with the result but at times it does feel a bit rough around the eye so I just make sure I&#x27;m extra gentle. Overall, don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra money for the brand name.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally receive my brushes. I ordered the \\&quot;Eye Kit\\&quot; and five additional brushes to have the full set of eye brushes. I ripped the box open to find all the brushes in a cute mesh bag with a drawstring and each brush was in its own little plastic sleeve, none of the bristles has been bent or crumpled at a quick glance. There was a little card that explained to first clean before use soooo I did. No shedding &amp; no dye flowed thur the soapy clear water :o). Once dry I went to apply my shadows with and the brush felt like silk in combination with my eye primer &amp; eye shadows. I got a little more excited and decided to do the foiling technique....OMG!!! FLAWLESS!!! I soon found myself using each and every brush. The brushes are not heavily weighted so they really felt comfortable &amp; easy to control unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m looking forward to passing the word about Sigma. I recommend these brushed to anyone who is looking for the perfect brushes at a affordable price - the next order will be the face brushes.</li>
    <li> This is the short eyeliner brush I have been looking for to apply those precise gel 60s cat eyes AND blend smoky niceness. Follow the cleaning instructions.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the fast shipment and quality of Sigma&#x27;s product(s). I will continue to shop with Sigma Beauty in the future.</li>
    <li> I would definently recommend this product to any of my friends. They are the best brushes and compariable to Mac but cheaper. Very good quality. Sigma brushes are the only brushes that I own and I love them. Very easy to clean and it makes a difference it the way my makeup looks.</li>
    <li> Great brush! A little prickly when you use the very tip, but easy to use the softer edges. Love Sigma brushes!</li>
    <li> Pinceau de qualité, look très haut de gamme à avoir absolument dans sa trousse à maquillage pour un maquillage parfait.</li>
    <li> Nice compact and firm bristles.  It does does a good job with packing on the product to the lid and crease.&lt;br /&gt;Overall not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> LOve it- no shedding- use to put on eyeshadow heavily.  It holds a lot. What else can be said? Nice</li>
    <li> This set was recommended to me by a professional make-up artist in the DC area.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  Description of contents and thier use included.</li>
    <li> This brand is really well made I love MAC and will start purchasing these brushes. It could be less stiff.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing .it places product beautifully</li>
    <li> If you have cheap  make-up brushes that you got in a large set and pouch, you probably don&#x27;t use half of them or you find that the bristles are rather poor quality and fall out easily, especially after a cleaning or two. Ditch these immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID have a cheap-o set that was way too overwhelming for me and there was no one brush that did anything for me well. After a total makeover by Merle Norman with amazing brushes and tools, I was convinced that the brushes make all the difference. This was the first brush I purchased for shading eye shadow on the brow bone and outer eye. It works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are full, dense and of great quality. There is no loss of bristles even after cleaning a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want your make-up to work for you -- especially if you have invested in good make-up, then get the proper tools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ditch the cheap, get the good.  Buy the good stuff!</li>
    <li> I like it for the most part, I think it applies cream shadows very well. It could be less stiff.</li>
    <li> It works don&#x27;t get me wrong but it&#x27;s a little rough ... Maybe I should&#x27;ve ordered the other one that sigma sells ....</li>
    <li> This brush has a few different uses for me. I can use to create a well defined crease line, smudge or color an eyeliner or just smudge the lower eyeliner. It&#x27;s precise and small enough to reach just the spot you want. Great brush!!</li>
    <li> Great price for a really nice brush perfect for blending out for smoky look or precision color in the crease.</li>
    <li> This is one of those brushes I use everyday. To place brow highlight, under eye shadow, and inner corner eye highlight. Can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s stubby and very condense so it deposits color nicely. I use it primarily to add color to the eyelids. This is also the perfect size to keep in your travel makeup kit.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are the best brushes I have found! They are soft to the touch and they don&#x27;t shed and the texture of the brushes don&#x27;t change with use. I have almost every Sigma brush they make and they are the best brushes ever. I wash and clean my brushes weekly and I never worry about the brushes becoming hard or having the bristles fall out. You never have to worry about bristles being left on your face when applying your makeup. Sigma is the only application brush I use. They are great!</li>
    <li> This brush is soft and does not shed! It looks to be a genuine Sigma brush. I use this with Laura Mercier&#x27;s concealer for cleaning up underneath my brows. No one else seems to do this but I find it&#x27;s so much easier than a tiny concealer brush!</li>
    <li> Sigmas brushes are well  worth the money.They&#x27;re soft and get the job done.They&#x27;re just as good as my Mac&lt;br /&gt;brushes.</li>
    <li> love this, would not buy a pricey brush of this type because this works fine.  picks up color well, has a firm texture and seems to be holding up well.</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Love Sigma brushes!  I have several sigma brushes, and love all of them!  This one is great for creating a smokey eye.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best for smudging eyeliner for a smokey affect or just to soften the line. It is very dense and firm which softens waterproof eyeliner that can be difficult to soften. It cleans easily and is very well made. A great price for it also.</li>
    <li> This brand is really well made I love MAC and will start purchasing these brushes. They work just as good as MAC and cheaper.</li>
    <li> This brush does a very good job smudging eyeshadow on my upper and lower lashline coz of its dense bristles. I&#x27;d use this over and over again. Plus it was neatly packaged. Well done Sigma and Amazon!</li>
    <li> The Sigma brushes are so soft and made of really nice quality materials.  They work well with both liquid makeup and powder makeup.</li>
    <li> Great for applying the Buxom Stay-There Waterproof eyeshadow.  The shadow has a sort of gel-like consistency and this brush blends it in just right.</li>
    <li> sigma sigma sigma always perfect quality!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It&#x27;s great for smuding, or lining the eyelas lines with shadow.  It&#x27;s not flimsy, but it isn&#x27;t rough on your eyelid.</li>
    <li> This is a great little shader/smudger brush. I used it this morning when I was smudging out my gunmetal gel eyeliner and it worked great. The bristles are tough enough to smudge but still soft enough for the eye area. I love Sigma brushes and this didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that the hair it coming off&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it&lt;br /&gt;Its still works you just have to be carefull</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, I am sure it could have many uses.  But I use it to define my brows and also to apply a powder eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I love Sigma brushes!</li>
    <li> I love Sigma brushes and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It does exactly the job it was designed to do.  Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap versions or imitations, go for the Sigma brushes every time.</li>
    <li> Not sure what makes this brush better than any I&#x27;ve used before.  Maybe the quality, the shape or the new kind of eyeliner powder I&#x27;m using with it (jes organics).</li>
    <li> This brush is great quality at an amazing price.  Will recommend this product, and similar products to everyone!  Will be purchasing similar products immediately!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It lives up to the hype from all of the other reviews. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my very favorite make up brushes. I use it to apply my eye shadow onto my very deep set eyes. It works beautifully. I then use a bit of a larger brush to blend. Sigma brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Love this brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the sigma brush. The Sigma E20 short shader brush is perfect to use for the outer V portion of the eyes to create concentrated smokey look. The bristles are soft and does not shed at all. Compared to my Mac, Stila, Bobbi Brown and Smashbox brushes this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> After reading the great reviews for this brush here and elsewhere online, I decided to purchase the Sigma E20 brush for smudging and blending eye liner. Fortunately this brush has more than delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is so effective at beautifully smudging and softening eye liner. It can be used on both upper and lower lids to smudge eye pencil, eye shadow and gel liner. The bristles are very tightly packed and stiff, yet still gentle. It&#x27;s important that any brush I use on my eye lids not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush will help to achieve the most beautiful soft, smoky eye. Great results every time! Well worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!! They are soft and apply the product amazingly, they are super soft and I cannot wait to buy more!!!</li>
    <li> I love Sigma brushes. This one did not disappoint. Very sturdy. I received this brush (and the other one I ordered) within just a few days. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Liked this right off the bat, it allows for greater precision and control when working the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; area for eyeshadow. It helps your shadow application be more defined, less muddy</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - build, blend be creative with applying make up on your eyes. I can&#x27;t compare it with any other brushes because I&#x27;ve never used brushes for my eyes before. But so far so good and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve made my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have quite a makeup collection!  I love Sigma brushes and this was does nor dissappoint!  I use it all the time to smudge on my lower lash line.  Definitely a must-have for your brush collection.</li>
    <li> This brush is a necessity! It can be used for applying eyeshadow on the lower lash line, smudging out an eyeliner, and for anything that requires precision. It is very stiff and packs on product as a result. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this sigma brush, own few sigma brushes, but the quality of this short shader brush is so crappy!  First the brush is so loose packed and also it sheds like crazy.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality brush for the price. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more</li>
    <li> i ordered this brush because chrisspy did a youtube makeup tutorial and used the sigma E20 specifically to smudge a little bit of eyeshadow over her eyeliner on the bottom lid. i bought this brush to fulfill that one purpose only (i haven&#x27;t tried it on any other part of my eye, even though the instructions said you can), so my review is just for that one use.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this brush. It&#x27;s perfect for smudging eyeliner and placing eyeshadow in the outer v. If you have hooded eyes I would strongly encourage you to get it. You will love it.</li>
    <li> Soft brisels, don&#x27;t shed, best brushes you can find, founds this brshes on a makeup tutorial by Camila cohelo. Love them</li>
    <li> This little eye shadow brush is perfect for the crease, and great for the price!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! This brush works great for lower lashes line. I love all of my Sigma brushes, very well made and do great jobs.</li>
    <li> This is another great brush from Sigma. This is great for the crease and also for applying powder over eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product. The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use</li>
    <li> I just bought it, and the handle is loose from the ferrule.</li>
    <li> Nice brush and quality.  Uses for blending in hard to reach places and eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I love Sigma, always have and always will. The quality is good and it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative to MAC. Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors. I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment. Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
