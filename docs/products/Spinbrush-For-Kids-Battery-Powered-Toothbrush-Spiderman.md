      <li>We ordered this a while ago, and while the brush is OK, it&#x27;s *</li>
      <li>The battery is ok but the toothbrush doesn´t work anyway.</li>
      <li>and now I probably won&#x27;t be able to return it.</li>
      <li>and I even more as I already had the toothbrush opened from its package</li>
      <li>is brushing more</li>
      <li>My son love it</li>
      <li>, it won&#x27;t stay on :)</li>
      <li>I bought this for my five years son and he love it, he start using immediately</li>
      <li>my toddlers love this</li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend you get your kid a powered toothbrush because they like to learn to brush a lot more when it is interesting to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad my Son didn&#x27;t see it first.</li>
      <li>kids choose this product because of the character and how unique the brush looks like.&lt;br /&gt;Yet</li>
      <li>I was going to purchase this exact brush last night, but after seeing it in person, then coming here to look at reviews, I&#x27;m happy I passed.</li>
      <li>I ordered this Toothbrush for my Son, because he loves Spiderman &amp; it looked really cool.</li>
      <li>My 3 year old was thrilled to find this spidey toothbrush in her stocking.</li>
      <li>He did think it was cool so</li>
      <li>Great for little kids because they can either press the button 0r</li>
      <li>picture shows spidey on some kind of circular platform in web-slinging pose (external but wrapped around the brush), and his head as the button.</li>
      <li>This one&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old loves it on auto control because he can handle it better without having to keep his finger on the button.</li>
      <li>To me it is well worth it if it means starting good oral hygiene habbits at a young age.</li>
      <li>The brush I received was exactly as the one pictured and is a good size for little hands.  </li>
      <li>The first one lasted about a month</li>
      <li>Have seen that model on Amazon as well, perhaps even for a little cheaper, but I had chose this one thinking that it would be more fun for the kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now my son wants to brush his teeth all of the time.</li>
      <li>the real products doesnt that that spiderman character or bottom head as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I always read reviews from Amazon, I really don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t read for this product.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I was very dissapointed with their performance.</li>
      <li>I thought that perhaps it was just a fluke, but then when the second one died in the first few weeks I decided that it must be something more than that.</li>
      <li>I don´t live in USA, so it is dificulty to change it..</li>
      <li>My 5 year old son loves brushing his teeth with this brush!</li>
      <li>decided to not buy it because it has to be replaced often enough that it seems to me that a higher end brush will be worth it for the long run.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After my checkup, my dentist was so surprised by my teeth that he now recommends this Spiderman brush to everyone.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>many complained about that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way less cool.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It looks cool, it appears to move rapidly at first, but after pressing the \\&quot;try me\\&quot; button for a few seconds, it seemed to bog down a bit.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My sons love to use this toothbrush and he likes the spiderman design of it.too bad Can&#x27;t replace the head.</li>
    <li> My toddler is always wanting to use my electric toothbrush.  So I got him this and it did the trick. He uses his instead now.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Cheaply made. Arrived with the power switch broken. My kid was very disappointed. Would not buy again. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 of the Spiderman Spinbrushes and both times I was very dissapointed with their performance. While they do encourage children to brush their teeth, the brushes do not last very long. The first one lasted about a month and then it died. I thought that perhaps it was just a fluke, but then when the second one died in the first few weeks I decided that it must be something more than that. Dissapointed in product and will be looking for an alternative for the next replacement.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old was thrilled to find this spidey toothbrush in her stocking. The product was as depicted, but the button is a &amp;#34;press on&amp;#34;.  She has trouble holding the button and brushing at the same time. So you may want to reconsider if purchasing for a toddler.</li>
    <li> Great for little kids because they can either press the button 0r lock it on automatic. My 4 year old loves it on auto control because he can handle it better without having to keep his finger on the button.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my five years son and he love it, he start using immediately and he now brush his teeth with joy.</li>
    <li> My little boy loves it, thank you!</li>
    <li> Great brush. My son love it</li>
    <li> I always read reviews from Amazon, I really don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t read for this product. When the item arrived it had nothing to do with what I ordered; as I went ahead and read the reviews I saw many complained about that. My son was upset and I even more as I already had the toothbrush opened from its package and now I probably won&#x27;t be able to return it. I didn&#x27;t contact the seller but I find it at least odd that other people have had the same issue.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old son loves brushing his teeth with this brush!</li>
    <li> Did not receive the model in the picture.  The picture portrays a 3-D Spiderman, with a face as the button.  Received a version that was not 3-D, but instead a sticker of Spiderman.  The button was a simple red button. Have seen that model on Amazon as well, perhaps even for a little cheaper, but I had chose this one thinking that it would be more fun for the kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, battery died immediately.  Went with 2 stars instead of 1 since, once the battery was replaced, it does indeed spin and do the intended task of brushing teeth.</li>
    <li> My son (3yrs) loves this brush and now loves brushing his teeth.  The brush I received was exactly as the one pictured and is a good size for little hands.  The battery can be removed and replaced if necessary but the brush head can not.  Although, for the price of this thing I can just replace it when the brush wears out.  To me it is well worth it if it means starting good oral hygiene habbits at a young age.</li>
    <li> Me cuesta mucho ser disciplinada y enseñarles a mis hijos a tener buenos habitos de higiene.   Definitivamente lo aprenden por repeticion (hay que estar atras y atras).   Me encanta la idea que se divierta lavandose los dientes.   Le encanta su cepillo y eso es lo mas importante.</li>
    <li> Now my son wants to brush his teeth all of the time.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I expected it to last quite awhile! I understood that the toothbrush head wasn&#x27;t replaceable- no worries. But the battery died before the head did! So now my kids are stuck with a toothbrush that is about a pound without even having the motor function! Will *not* be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> My grandson loves Spiderman and now I can get him to brush his teeth with no problem since he thinks Spiderman is helping him!</li>
    <li> The product in the picture has nothing to do with what i have received.&lt;br /&gt;My kids choose this product because of the character and how unique the brush looks like.&lt;br /&gt;Yet the real products doesnt that that spiderman character or bottom head as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy it.</li>
    <li> Does not look as pictured, but my son loves it !! The pic is misleading....</li>
    <li> It may be difficult to rate this as my grandson if using it.  He did think it was cool so is brushing more</li>
    <li> This one&#x27;s pretty cool. It has a mode that you have to hold it down to activate, so I don&#x27;t care if my son runs away with it, it won&#x27;t stay on :)</li>
    <li> my toddlers love this, I highly recommend you get your kid a powered toothbrush because they like to learn to brush a lot more when it is interesting to use.</li>
    <li> I received it, put the battery and nothing happened. The battery is ok but the toothbrush doesn´t work anyway. I don´t live in USA, so it is dificulty to change it..</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my great grandson.  I am sure he loved it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Toothbrush for my Son, because he loves Spiderman &amp; it looked really cool. I received it quicker than I thought but it is not what is in the picture. It&#x27;s wack. I&#x27;m glad my Son didn&#x27;t see it first. I still have time to return it.</li>
    <li> We ordered this a while ago, and while the brush is OK, it&#x27;s *very* different than what was pictured. It&#x27;s way less cool. The brush is the standard non-contoured shape with a picture of Spider Man on it. We&#x27;d never have ordered it if we&#x27;d known that -- there are cooler brushes around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting an \\&quot;electric\\&quot; brush for my son. I ALMOST purchased this last night at the local mart, it is only $5.00 there. before taxes.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to not buy it because it has to be replaced often enough that it seems to me that a higher end brush will be worth it for the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks cool, it appears to move rapidly at first, but after pressing the \\&quot;try me\\&quot; button for a few seconds, it seemed to bog down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry for the 3 star review, because I did not use it. I was going to purchase this exact brush last night, but after seeing it in person, then coming here to look at reviews, I&#x27;m happy I passed.</li>
    <li> Son loves it.  Teacher recommended</li>
    <li> picture shows spidey on some kind of circular platform in web-slinging pose (external but wrapped around the brush), and his head as the button. the one we received doesn&#x27;t have this spidey at all and has the spider logo as the button.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. Gets in all the spots that regular brushes could never even touch. It&#x27;s as if Spiderman himself is in my mouth! After my checkup, my dentist was so surprised by my teeth that he now recommends this Spiderman brush to everyone. Hopefully now everyone will have Spiderman in their mouths! Thanks Spidey :B</li>
