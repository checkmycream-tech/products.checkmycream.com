      <li>I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of astringents but this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It is so cheap, but the salicylic acid is so effective without being overly drying.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I keep this near the baby wipes (not for baby!), but a squirt on a wipe is excellent for hitting oily patches, and even for a quick spritz if I feel in need of freshening up between showers.  </li>
      <li>Best astringent on the market!&lt;br /&gt;The cost is a bit higher than you may see at a local drugstore but amazing product.</li>
      <li>If used twice a day over affected areas it works great for adult acne.  </li>
      <li>The smell could be strong for some people, but is otherwise fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>One day I was spending some free time at Target</li>
      <li>have spent years as well as hundreds of dollars trying to find the ideal acne treatment for me.</li>
      <li>pimple prone skin blemish free.</li>
      <li>If I use this with an exfoliating sponge every day I am virtually breakout free.</li>
      <li>you have light acne or just want something to give you a clean feeling, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to pick some of this up and give it a try.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this for breakouts.</li>
      <li>It makes my face feel clean and helps with acne.</li>
      <li>It also works great for other body parts that might get a breakout or two.</li>
      <li>The Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst face wash seems to make my skin the most oily, so</li>
      <li>and I saw this product in a 3-step package (paired with the face cleaner and moisturizers by the same brand) on sale for a nice discount, and I figured I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think the 5 minutes of burning is worth it.</li>
      <li>Alcohol seems the way to go, and this one works pretty good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i swear my roommate stole my most recent order before i could get to it.</li>
      <li>you have first</li>
      <li>Product came promptly, was as expected, nicely packed.  </li>
      <li>I resort to other cleaning methods now, fancy face masks, trendy beaded moisturizing cleansers,</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel super clean, i can only assume its some</li>
      <li>I have been using Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Astringent since my early teen/pre-teen years, and never realized exactly how much it helps until I stopped using it about a year ago.</li>
      <li>Contains too much alcohol.</li>
      <li>Put it on with cotton squares and really soak it into your skin at night.</li>
      <li>I am very diligent about my skin (I&#x27;m 74 y.o.)</li>
      <li>I recommend applying it with a cotton ball as it is very runny.</li>
      <li>so I really don&#x27;t use it often anymore.</li>
      <li>i wonder how she used up that much so fast.</li>
      <li>It all works very well on my face.</li>
      <li>After it dries I put on the Clean and Clear Dual Action moisturizer and go to bed.</li>
      <li>okay, maybe not perfectly- but better than some of the things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Cleans face and neck great and  does  not sting --- I use it at least twice daily so buy in bulk</li>
      <li>Probably not since high school.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend</li>
      <li>Be sure to bring back the PH level of your skin as an astringent will dry out your skin too much and start to wrinkle before time.  </li>
      <li>Not until Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent!  </li>
      <li>you are looking to cure yourself of a long time problem, this is not the solution, but if you have a temporary issue, this will fix you right up!</li>
      <li>I mean the smell isn&#x27;t amazing or anything</li>
      <li>I live in S. Florida and have suffered breakouts continuously ever since I moved from the Northeast where I NEVER had a problem with my skin.</li>
      <li>you just have a bit of a breakout but generally good skin, this will take those suckers out in no time, and it leaves your skin feeling fresh and tight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Bigger or swollen pimples will go down in size pretty quickly if you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get rid of acne or pimples completely, but it does help quite a bit.</li>
      <li>I have oily, sensitive skin</li>
      <li>You can indeed use it for that, though it won&#x27;t get it completely off.</li>
      <li>because I have sensitive skin or what</li>
      <li>I have been using this for about a month now and while my oiliness is not gone, the redness has completely disappeared and the blemishes are significantly smaller.</li>
      <li>When I use some other types of acne washes, my skin can become really oily.</li>
      <li>I would have a new breakout every single day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A nice refreshing way to end your cleaning routine. Makes my face feel super clean, i can only assume its some what doing what it claims. SLight dryness of the face but i have a routine like Patrick Bateman in AMerican Psycho so i do alright.</li>
    <li> Works and slightly burns.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after using an acne cleanser.</li>
    <li> Best astringent on the market!&lt;br /&gt;The cost is a bit higher than you may see at a local drugstore but amazing product. Put it on with cotton squares and really soak it into your skin at night. Do not put lotions on your face after you put this on because lotions will clog your pores.</li>
    <li> Contains too much alcohol. You can just smell it when you&#x27;re applying it onto your face. Stings my face and makes my eyes water. Too drying for my face and I have oily to combination skin.  Leaves my skin feeling tight and drying. The step 1 foaming face wash that complements with this toner is already a little drying on my face. Along with this toner, my face will feel like a raisin. I&#x27;ve used half of the bottle and gave it to my mom who have the oily-est skin ever and she even says that it was too drying and stings her face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Astringent since my early teen/pre-teen years, and never realized exactly how much it helps until I stopped using it about a year ago. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of acne or pimples completely, but it does help quite a bit. Bigger or swollen pimples will go down in size pretty quickly if you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin. When I use some other types of acne washes, my skin can become really oily. This astringent actually dries out your skin, so if you use it you will get some bothersome facial peeling.  Definitely use a facial lotion with it! The Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst face wash seems to make my skin the most oily, so I figure I&#x27;ll try using this with that and see if they even each other out to make my skin less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it works okay, maybe not perfectly- but better than some of the things I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a nice addition to another cleaner you are using for spot treatments or to help get off some troublesome make up. That being said- it is very potent. For an example, when I was a teenager one of my friends told me you can use this to remove permanent marker from your skin. You can indeed use it for that, though it won&#x27;t get it completely off. (Magic eraser works much better! (&#x3D; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have light acne or just want something to give you a clean feeling, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to pick some of this up and give it a try. I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction to it besides peeling/dry skin, which is more than I can say for some acne products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of astringents but this is my favorite. Will never buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Works great</li>
    <li> I like this toner a lot. I also bought the cleanser and moisturizer that goes with it. It all works very well on my face. I have oily, sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. It makes my face feel clean and helps with acne.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for breakouts. Thankfully, those have diminished (so I guess it works well!) so I really don&#x27;t use it often anymore. If I notice that my face is breaking out, I&#x27;ll use it once or twice and it usually takes care of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat combination skin, so it does dry out your face a lot. Just beware and moisturize well between uses.</li>
    <li> If used twice a day over affected areas it works great for adult acne.  I&#x27;m a mid century guy who breaks out on my nose and around my mouth and this stuff prevents almost all breakouts.  It&#x27;s an exfoliator with 2% Salicylic acid...that&#x27;s why it works.  It also has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Very good my product arrived a good time</li>
    <li> This product is amazing on skin. I mean the smell isn&#x27;t amazing or anything but thats not a big issue. The only bad thing is that the product stings really really bad on skin. I don&#x27;t know if its because I have sensitive skin or what but it stings. But, considering how good my skin looks after and how well this does on pimples I think the 5 minutes of burning is worth it. It works best if you pop whatever blackhead or pimple you have first then just put this on. It dries on its own. Be careful though because it&#x27;ll sting hella bad then too. After it dries I put on the Clean and Clear Dual Action moisturizer and go to bed. Also I&#x27;ve noticed that after I pop a pimple,  if I put this on there usually I have no scarring which is great!&lt;br /&gt;So yeah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Great on Pimples&lt;br /&gt;  Prevents Scarring&lt;br /&gt;  Works Basically Overnight&lt;br /&gt;  Not that Costly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: STINGS!!&lt;br /&gt;  Smells Like Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I helped! :D</li>
    <li> I have an oily T-zone, and have been trying to find a good astringent for quite some time. Scrubs, facials, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it, and it&#x27;s always failed. Alcohol seems the way to go, and this one works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just have a bit of a breakout but generally good skin, this will take those suckers out in no time, and it leaves your skin feeling fresh and tight. However, if you have a problem area like me, this will only minimize the problem and make it a little less terrible. I have a smattering of blemishes across my forehead which are normally very red with flaky spots. With one days use of this (I used it three times a day; morning, afternoon, and before bed) the redness was already gone and the flaky spots had disappeared! I have been using this for about a month now and while my oiliness is not gone, the redness has completely disappeared and the blemishes are significantly smaller. As for pimples that have just popped up due to stress or sweat, this gets rid of them within one to three days, depending on severity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to cure yourself of a long time problem, this is not the solution, but if you have a temporary issue, this will fix you right up!</li>
    <li> I live in S. Florida and have suffered breakouts continuously ever since I moved from the Northeast where I NEVER had a problem with my skin. Ever!  Here in the south there is a lot of mold and bacteria which if you have a bad habit of touching your face (like me) , - undoubtedly you will have a breakout.  I am very diligent about my skin (I&#x27;m 74 y.o.) and  No amount of cleansers was preventing breakouts: facials, mud packs, peels, etc. all were failing.  Not until Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent!  I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout ever since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT! Be sure to bring back the PH level of your skin as an astringent will dry out your skin too much and start to wrinkle before time.  After cleansing do the following:  prepare an equal amount of witch hazel and bottled lemon juice and put it in a plastic squeeze bottle.  Then soak a cotton ball with it and apply it all over your face and neck..  Then apply Watts 100% Hyralonic Acid Solution to your face and neck;  then apply a Vitamin C serum, following up with a Retinol A cream.  Voila!  My 74 y.o. skin looks radiant.  Do this 2x a day and your skin will glow.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but will dry out your skin so use lotion after use.  Great price for what it provides  Highly Recommend</li>
    <li> Cleans face and neck great and  does  not sting --- I use it at least twice daily so buy in bulk</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used this stuff. Probably not since high school. I resort to other cleaning methods now, fancy face masks, trendy beaded moisturizing cleansers, ultra brightening makeup cloths etc. But the truth is when I wake up and my nose and chin feel greasy, sometimes I just want to swipe and go. It also works great for other body parts that might get a breakout or two. Good formula, cleans grease, doesn&#x27;t over-dry, doesn&#x27;t smell too strong. I like it.</li>
    <li> I started using this instead of TendSkin for the ingrown hairs on my legs and I haven&#x27;t gone back since. It is so cheap, but the salicylic acid is so effective without being overly drying. I recommend applying it with a cotton ball as it is very runny.</li>
    <li> Great price and kept my summer oily prone , pimple prone skin blemish free.</li>
    <li> Oh. My. God. This is the best product ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Doesn’t sting&lt;br /&gt;• Cleans deep within the pores&lt;br /&gt;• Clears up acne and prevents future breakouts&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• The smell could be strong for some people, but is otherwise fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent years as well as hundreds of dollars trying to find the ideal acne treatment for me. I had cystic acne as well as massive scarring and hyperpigmentation. I would have a new breakout every single day. I tried drugstore brands, high-end brands, as well as sulfur-infused formulas, everything on the market but nothing worked. One day I was spending some free time at Target and I saw this product in a 3-step package (paired with the face cleaner and moisturizers by the same brand) on sale for a nice discount, and I figured I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did. This is the best acne treatment out there. If I use this with an exfoliating sponge every day I am virtually breakout free. I realize that everyone’s skin is different but for me this is THE product. It is even working to cease my scars and hyperpigmentation. I have serious results with this product and recommend it for people with combination and oily skin, at least to try.</li>
    <li> but i swear my roommate stole my most recent order before i could get to it. i wonder how she used up that much so fast.</li>
    <li> I keep this near the baby wipes (not for baby!), but a squirt on a wipe is excellent for hitting oily patches, and even for a quick spritz if I feel in need of freshening up between showers.  Product came promptly, was as expected, nicely packed.  Plus, it does not have the witch hazel scent others had, which, frankly smelled like men&#x27;s aftershave to me, a smell I did not feel enhanced my feminine aura.</li>
