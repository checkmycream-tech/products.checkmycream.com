      <li>/&gt;Not as pleased for the money.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would be wasting another $20 just like I had so many times before.</li>
      <li>Oil of Olay has been pretty good for me over the years.</li>
      <li>But, as far as moisturizing goes, it is great.</li>
      <li>easy wen you eat or drink.</li>
      <li>I will continue to see if I can find more because this is such a great product.</li>
      <li>I would strongly reccommend this product.</li>
      <li>Fine product.</li>
      <li>Most of my normal shopping stops no longer carried this product so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and at 70</li>
      <li>It keeps my lips moist &amp; smooth &amp; I can still use lip gloss over it.</li>
      <li>a significant difference.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to see this lip product come out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a great product, I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to trust my friend&#x27;s recommendation!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for dry lips.</li>
      <li>, they need to be special care all the time...</li>
      <li>I purchased this product previously from a store and loved it!.  </li>
      <li>She says that she can&#x27;t apply lipstick without it because she has &amp;#34;old lips, and lipsticks and lip liners don&#x27;t write on them.&amp;#34; Well, she happens to have beautiful lips that look far from old,  regardless of her age.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and it does a good job.  </li>
      <li>As far as getting rid of fine lines, I have not noticed a difference, but did not have many to begin with.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly at night because I tend to sleep with my mouth open and this helps to keep my lips from becoming so chapped.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to like it, to be quite honest, because it costs waaaaay too much in the stores where I live.  </li>
      <li>but using it overnight certainly makes my lips soft and prevents any kind of chapping.  </li>
      <li>And after just a few days, they looked great too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recently I only use the Olay lip treatment after lightly covering foundation on my lips... not any more use channel lip gloss.</li>
      <li>A great product, best in the market compared to other expensive treatments.  </li>
      <li>The product is all right as a lip gloss</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a huge improvement, but my normally dry lips are definitely more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I use many others and really like them but would not waste money on this one.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and no mess.  </li>
      <li>more like it did when I was younger.</li>
      <li>In fact, I bought my first lip treatment at a drugstore.</li>
      <li>My mom has been using this product since it first came out</li>
      <li>Until the size/shape/quantity improve, I will probably spend my 20 bucks on something higher quality.  </li>
      <li>I love oil of olay but this product falls short of their quality.</li>
      <li>The Olay product not only didn&#x27;t fill out any lines, but actually dried out my lips incredibly and made them crack.  </li>
      <li>First time purchasing this product, &amp; MUCH cheaper here, compared to stores, where you will pay close to $20-$23.</li>
      <li>It makes your lips super soft and leaves a shiny tint to them.</li>
      <li>Within in one week my lips were softer smother and fine line starting to diminish.  </li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I tried their skin and eye Regenerist lines and really like them.  </li>
      <li>Winter is very drying on my skin and this helps moisturize my lips while I sleep.</li>
      <li>I find that I am not using lip balm quite as much.  </li>
      <li>It also helps my lips to feel much smoother.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use it much because of this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and am really noticing a difference.</li>
      <li>but nothing seemed to really work.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really see it improved.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize any better than your typical chapstick would.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many products and much more expensive products, none of which compared to the quality of this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a loyal Olay user and it&#x27;s the only brand of products I use for skin care...</li>
      <li>This is amazing and suddenly hard to find.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have been using it for a few years.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily, no slick or sticky feel yet</li>
      <li>It keeps lips soft, smooth and it fights the little lines we get around our mouth as we age.</li>
      <li>It promises to clear up the wrinkles which it doesn&#x27;t of course</li>
      <li>I was quite surprised</li>
      <li>I am 41 years old.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any changes right away and then suddenly they were gone, totally gone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great for lip lines.  I am having a hard time finding it in the store.  I sure hope they are not discontinuing.</li>
    <li> I use it for chap stick, only thing is it comes off easy wen you eat or drink. it is very smooth.</li>
    <li> I wish this product was about $10 cheaper.  I&#x27;ve been using this lip treatment for almost 3 weeks and I really like it.  I haven&#x27;t seen a huge improvement, but my normally dry lips are definitely more moisturized.  I usually put this on after my facial routine right before bed... and whenever else I can think to put it on.  I think it also makes a nice gift to give someone who&#x27;s into these type of products.  It&#x27;s pricey, but nice.</li>
    <li> This product made my lips very dry and cracked.  I usually use Burt&#x27;s Bee balm to keep my lips hydrated.  The Olay product not only didn&#x27;t fill out any lines, but actually dried out my lips incredibly and made them crack.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone.   I tried their skin and eye Regenerist lines and really like them.  I was hoping this would work as the skin care line was highly rated by Consumer Reports, but alas, it didn&#x27;t.  It actually made things worse and at $6, a tube, I would save my money and buy three tubes of Burt&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful about this product. Oil of Olay has been pretty good for me over the years. But I agree with some of the other reviewers. Far from \\&quot;filling out lines\\&quot; and moisturizing my lips, this product has actually dried out my lips (a lot!) and done nothing for lines. Don&#x27;t get how Olay can make these claims, because I see zero of the results they promise. A very expensive, very disappointing product.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to many things and this product works for me. No perfume. It keeps lips soft, smooth and it fights the little lines we get around our mouth as we age.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and it does a good job.  However, I do not believe the results justify the excessive price that is charged.</li>
    <li> I was hoping the lip treatment will minimize the lines on my lip but I don&#x27;t really see it improved. Could be just me. But I won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> My lips are a little bit thick... people  say they look sexy like Angelina Jolie&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;However, they need to be special care all the time... I have used the Olay lip treatment last for 4~5yrs day and night.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I only use the Olay lip treatment after lightly covering foundation on my lips... not any more use channel lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I recently found out that Olay has discontinued this item and was so very happy to be able to find 2 through Amazon.  I will continue to see if I can find more because this is such a great product.</li>
    <li> A great product, best in the market compared to other expensive treatments.  Instant moisturising and results that last for hours.  Addiction has happened can&#x27;t use any other lip product.</li>
    <li> I love Olay&#x27;s lip treatment. Winter is very drying on my skin and this helps moisturize my lips while I sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a loyal Olay user and it&#x27;s the only brand of products I use for skin care...so I was excited to see this lip product come out. I was disappointed after using it, it cakes up and leaves that white line on your inner lip and in the corner of your mouth.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in using it and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize any better than your typical chapstick would.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again, it&#x27;s very very overpriced and not worth it.</li>
    <li> My lip lines are diminished and my lips are hydrated.  I find that I am not using lip balm quite as much.  I compare prices on everything I purchase.  The price with AmericaRX is excellent!  Even Wal-Mart can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for a few years. I never buy it at the drugstore because it&#x27;s about $20-$25 depending where you go. So I order it here and get it for about $14-$16 usually...what is with the doubling and even tripling of the price? Is it being discontinued? What the heck?</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but made my lips feel weird. I didn&#x27;t use it much because of this. Hit or miss.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and no mess.  Goes on easily, no slick or sticky feel yet it looks natural and w/ a slight shine. My lips appear fuller and I&#x27;m impressed w/ the results that I&#x27;ve had in the past 2 weeks of use.  This will definetly be part of my routine from now on.  Fine product.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product.  I&#x27;ve tried others and this is the best that I&#x27;ve tried of this type of product</li>
    <li> great product - wish Olay didn&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this lip treatment. My lips tend to be very dry and I am always looking for something new to try for that problem. This product actually made my lips even drier and redder. It feels great going on but after that it is downhill. I normally love the Olay Regenerist line of products and that is why I thought this was going to be great. Sorry to say, but the Anti Aging lip treatment just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> I was quite surprised when I first used this--there is an unpleasant taste and smell that last about a 1/2 hour after application. On the other hand, my lips feel smoother and a little more plump. I will be looking for a product with similar results and no odor when this is gone.</li>
    <li> It promises to clear up the wrinkles which it doesn&#x27;t of course but using it overnight certainly makes my lips soft and prevents any kind of chapping.  I don&#x27;t use it under or over lipstick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now.  As long as I keep using it my lips don&#x27;t dry out like they used to.</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old. Recently I&#x27;d begun to notice that the little vertical creases around my upper lips were really starting to look deep and severe. My upper lip in general was looking thinner. I know some of this is hereditary - I remember my mom&#x27;s lips looked just like this. But, like us all, I wondered if there was something I could do. I&#x27;m very skeptical of all the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; wrinkle creams out there, but I&#x27;ve been happy with some other Olay products so figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and am really noticing a difference. I keep it in my purse and apply throughout the day, using as a regular lip balm / lip gloss (I don&#x27;t wear lipstick). In terms of gloss, I like the way it looks - natural and moist rather than slick and shiny. It feels fine, similar to other lip balms, with just a tiny hint of tingle. I have been applying this on my lips and also just beyond the lipline as well. Those sharp lines around my lips have really softened - they haven&#x27;t gone away, but they are softer and my upper lip looks a little more plump and natural than it did before, more like it did when I was younger. The lines are less noticeable due to the plumping of the lip itself and the softening of the lines along the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer in this product and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!! I&#x27;m always looking for new lip treatments and even with this price I&#x27;m on my second order. It makes your lips super soft and leaves a shiny tint to them. You can wear it day or night. I wouldn&#x27;t say it pairs well with lipstick though. Maybe if you put it over?</li>
    <li> Although trying to find another one is proving to be quite difficult.  I keep trying to find another source for it, but I can&#x27;t find one. (at least not that inexpensive)</li>
    <li> It makes my lips feel softer and fuller. I don&#x27;t think it makes them look any fuller. It helps soften the lines around my mouth.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years. It keeps my lips moist &amp; smooth &amp; I can still use lip gloss over it. I hope Olay is still going to make this product or replace it with something that works equally well...it is getting impossible to find in the stores so I ordered from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product previously from a store and loved it!.  Since I could not find it at a store so I ordered .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as pleased for the money.  Still works.</li>
    <li> I saw no improvement or any difference as in before and after use  I would purchase this again, nor would I recommend</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  As we age our lips begin to thin out until it looks like we don&#x27;t even have an upper lip. This lip treatment is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t make you lips burn or tingle. It goes on smooth and at 70+ I still have my lips. I do still use my regular lip balm in addition to this, but without Olay lip treatment I start having my lips shrink away. I don&#x27;t plan on stopping it soon. Hopefully they will continue to manufacture it. I would hate to be without it.</li>
    <li> As far as I can see it is just a glorified lip gloss and not a very good one.  I used it but saw no great improvements.  Definitely not as good as other Olay products.  I use many others and really like them but would not waste money on this one.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that keeps my lips hydrated, not just coated. I don&#x27;t understand why Olay discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I was addicted to Neutrogena lip plumping treatment until it was discontinued.  This is no comparison.  My lips are still dry, the product is gone already (lasted only a few weeks with twice daily application), and the whole stick has broken off several times.  Yuck.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and suddenly hard to find. I had all kinds of vertical lines and started using this. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes right away and then suddenly they were gone, totally gone. I use it every night before I go to bed. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have very dry lips and have tried everything but nothing seemed to really work. A friend recommended this to me and I have to admit, I was skeptical. I thought I would be wasting another $20 just like I had so many times before. I&#x27;ve been using the product for three days now and the difference is incredible. The not-so-fine lines are dissapearing, my lips feel softer and for once, aren&#x27;t peeling! The product isn&#x27;t greasy, and actually feels as if it&#x27;s penetrating your lips, not just coating them. It&#x27;s really a great product, I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to trust my friend&#x27;s recommendation!</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> The product is all right as a lip gloss but I am underwhelmed for its use as an anti-aging lip treatment.  It is possible that since this product has been discontinued by Olay, it may have lost its potency.  For the cost, there are many other current products out there for much less or the same dollar amount.</li>
    <li> I use this Olay lip as my lip moisturizer/balm because it&#x27;s light and comfortable, and it keeps my lips feeling good. While it&#x27;s a bit expensive for everyday use, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just sorry I cannot seem to find it in the stores anymore.  I use it everyday.  It&#x27;s a nice product.  I don&#x27;t really know how long it lasts though after an application.  I think it works for at least 2-3 hours.</li>
    <li> First time purchasing this product, &amp; MUCH cheaper here, compared to stores, where you will pay close to $20-$23. I have been trying for the last year to find a lib balm that actually works, &amp; this does. As far as getting rid of fine lines, I have not noticed a difference, but did not have many to begin with. But, as far as moisturizing goes, it is great. My lips stopped cracking, peeling, and feeling sore all the time. The only downside, is it does not last long at all. I have had it for about 3 weeks, &amp; it is almost gone(and I stopped using it 3-4 times a day &amp; cut back to 1-2/day after I noticed how little actually comes in the tube). It actually stays on the majority of the night, &amp; I don&#x27;t wake up with dry lips.. it&#x27;s actually still on my lips.</li>
    <li> product is no different then putting chap stick on your face!  It does nothing.  I should have requested a refund.</li>
    <li> Works so good I am reordering.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best product I&#x27;ve found for my lips!  I&#x27;d begun to get those dreaded age lines on my lips and above the lips, and this product has almost completely gotten rid of those on my lips. All that&#x27;s left is a small line on my upper and a small one on my lower...a significant difference.  I&#x27;m sold!!! In fact, I bought my first lip treatment at a drugstore. Since I&#x27;m now having troubles finding it in stores, I&#x27;m stocking up online.&lt;br /&gt;Oil of Olay, do NOT get rid of this product!!!  People just need to discover it!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product helps my lips to feel. I use it mostly at night because I tend to sleep with my mouth open and this helps to keep my lips from becoming so chapped. It also helps my lips to feel much smoother.</li>
    <li> I put this on at night after I wash my face.  When I wake up in the morning, my lips feel like silk. This is very nice stuff! It&#x27;s getting hard to find in stores.  Buy it up while you can!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My lips feel great as soon as I put it on. And after just a few days, they looked great too. No more cracked, dry lips. My lips look fuller and feel better.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years as a nighttime treatment.  Most of my normal shopping stops no longer carried this product so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is a totally waste of money....</li>
    <li> i would not recommend this product, it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do.  Save your $$ don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> ever searching for the product that will work. this one hasn&#x27;t yet. I&#x27;ll give it longer then the promised 2 weeks and see what happens</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and Olay seems to have stopped producing it.  I found it online.  The price was exhorbitant, but I love the product.</li>
    <li> This product works well.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  I have sensitive skin, but this didn&#x27;t create any problems, despite the slight tingling I felt the first few applications.  I didn&#x27;t want to like it, to be quite honest, because it costs waaaaay too much in the stores where I live.  But I liked the way it made my lips feel.  I applied it am/pm, and my lips stayed dry and felt protected all day long.  There was no plumping action (unfortunately), and the creases were still visible, but they were MUCH less obvious than before.  When I ran out 3 weeks ago, I refused to buy more, for the reasons I list below.  Today, I noticed how dried out and creased my lips have become.  (((sigh)))  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m looking around for another product, because I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay so much for such a cheap product...  The tube it comes in is cheap, the stick of product is too thin, doesn&#x27;t dispense well, and ends up breaking off and/or squishing around inside the tube.  Plus, there&#x27;s not enough of it.  I&#x27;m sorry, olay, but there&#x27;s nothing in this product that warrants such a high price tag-- it&#x27;s just your microsculpting face cream with a little vaseline thrown in it-- so GIVE US A BIGGER/THICKER STICK!  Please.  Until the size/shape/quantity improve, I will probably spend my 20 bucks on something higher quality.  Update: the Philosophy eye/lip cream tube is pure miracles and works even better than this did, for less, and with much less waste.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for dry lips.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I have found to truly moisturize my lips and keep them feeling great!  Really hard to find in stores though! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this product since it first came out and she loves it. She says that she can&#x27;t apply lipstick without it because she has &amp;#34;old lips, and lipsticks and lip liners don&#x27;t write on them.&amp;#34; Well, she happens to have beautiful lips that look far from old,  regardless of her age. Anyway, she has tried other products from higher end brands and she still swears by this product.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY MOM WHO CANT FIND IT IN RETAIL STORES ANYMORE. LOVES IT GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it is very disappointing that Olay has discontinued it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product.Product exceded my expectations. Within in one week my lips were softer smother and fine line starting to diminish.  I have tried many products and much more expensive products, none of which compared to the quality of this product. What has impressed me most, was how quickly this product started working. I would strongly reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love oil of olay but this product falls short of their quality. It was a complete waste of money.</li>
