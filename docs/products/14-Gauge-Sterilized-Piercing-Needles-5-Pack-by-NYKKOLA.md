<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They were clean, packaged nice, and worked great for my ears! Went through smoothly and barely tugged! I suggest these!</li>
    <li> These were very sharp and did not cause much pain when used to pierce the belly buttons of 3 people.</li>
    <li> I got these about a week after I ordered them. The needles were bagged and sealed nicely, in individual packages. I used one to pierce my cartilage. The needle was super sharp, so I felt only a little pinch, and because it&#x27;s a hollow needle, I was able to put my earring in easily. I can&#x27;t wait to use the other four!</li>
    <li> These made it very easy for me to do my own piercings at home. Way cheaper than a piercing parlor.</li>
    <li> Never buy from this company. I Ordered this product over a month ago and they will not respond to any of my e-mails and have no phone number listed. All this company is is a hassle.</li>
    <li> I got the 14 gauge and the 16 gauge needles, The 3 piercings ive done so far have worked great!</li>
    <li> These needles are great.  I used these to do a smiley piercing and a septum piercing. They&#x27;re very sharp, making the process almost painless.</li>
    <li> These needles are fantastic for any type of piercing as long as  you use them responsibly of course,  definitively do recommend! Also super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I ordered these and didnt know what to expect with them being so cheep. I absolutely love these and would definantly use them again. They helped reduce the pain of the piercing area and worked great.</li>
    <li> item as described, individualy wrapped and sharp. fast shipping</li>
    <li> I loved it so much . Came before the estimated delivery . They came in little packages and when I used it, it didn&#x27;t hurt one bit !!! I will definitely buy again if I need more</li>
    <li> This product arrive really fast.I pierce my ear and I thought I was going to get infected,but I was wrong.The needles work fine.I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> they got here very late, and i was very disappointed. but the needles were sharp and they worked well so its ok.</li>
    <li> They came faster than expected and really sharp so I had no pain ! I did my friends belly button and it went right through, I will be ordering from the again</li>
    <li> The needles worked great, they are razor sharp, pierced through my nose cartlidge easily and quickly. The package arrived very quickly too. Needless to say, Im happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> iv been waiting for over a month and i still havent recieved this product!! never order from this company! just avoid it! they dont return any emails either!!! just avoid this company!!!</li>
    <li> needles are very sharp pierces skin easily in small plastic packaging clean i have used them to pierce 3 lip rings and one belly button</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy piercing equipment online. When they say it&#x27;s sterilized it really isn&#x27;t sterilized. Back when I first started off doing piercing I made that mistake and every needle I got offline made people get infections and I was top of the line sterol.</li>
    <li> Perfect needles and sterile</li>
    <li> THEY WERE EXCELLENT,EASY TO USE,AND VERY STERILE.NO INFECTION.IT&#x27;S NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE BY YOURSELF. AND VERY CLEAN.</li>
    <li> well i got needles. they got THAT right. i also ordered a barbell from them. but they got the needle size WRONG. i ordered a set of 14g needles. but i got 16g. and now the barbell is bigger than the needle. how am i supposed to pierce anyone? i am definitely not satisfied.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these they are amazing slices through skin so smooth and fast no troubles perfectly clean I was personally happy about it</li>
    <li> When they arrived a lot of them were already open!</li>
    <li> Brand new and perfect for a 14g piercing. Came two days early. I&#x27;ve bought a lot of piercing needles before and this pack is just as good.</li>
    <li> I will deffinatly be buying more of these when I run out! I have pierced my hip and belly button with just these needles, and they were so sharp I didn&#x27;t need a clamp. they went right through. I love these needles, such a good price too!</li>
    <li> these needles did not fit. I ordered them to pierce my belly button and the size was too small. the ring did not fit within the hollow point of the needle like it was supposed to. This was supposed to be the right size but they are to small. i did not figure this out until the needle was already through my skin so i was not able to get the ring in and complete the piercing. now i will just have a scar..</li>
    <li> they were exactly as described in teh descriotion. i would recomend this product to someone. thank you for the great buy</li>
    <li> Arizona Tattoo Supply is a super legit company, with fair prices, quality product, and on time shipping. When i order piercing products, i make sure that i go out of my way to order from them. This company will have my business will again.&lt;br /&gt;14 Gauge needles were superb. They got the Job done. I never worry about dirty needles when there from Arizona Tattoo Supply.</li>
    <li> It was painless since the needles were so sharp! Would buy from this seller again if I needed to.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is searching for easy to use, inexpensive and sharp piercing needles. Definitely good quality, shipping was fast, and overall a great product!</li>
    <li> Very sharp, came early, sterile, and I will definitely buy them again. Great quality for such a cheap price</li>
    <li> I had got this to pierce my navel, and it had worked perfect. I ordered these on a Wednesday, they had arrived Friday. So, the shipping was quite excellent. Also, the needle quality was great! They are extremely sharp and painless.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these piercing needles.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Five 14g piercing needles. They all came individually wrapped in separate bags with the seal that they were sterilized with the gas. I&#x27;m super happy with buying from them. It was a great price and they came super fast without any problems. I will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a gret price!</li>
    <li> The needles arrived very quickly and were very sharp, each came in it&#x27;s own bag, they worked great!!! I would deff buy them again,</li>
    <li> I did my first piercings with these on my own. My ears didn&#x27;t get infected. They needles are super sharp. I let them sit in alcohol overnight and then rinsed them with more alcohol and water the next day before I did my piercings. I saved money and time. They don&#x27;t hurt too much since they&#x27;re sooooo sharp. Worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Everything was as described, needles work GREAT! Have had many happy customers. Would recommend this to everyone looking to pierce their Navel.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to start gauging my ears and I needed to repierce one of them so instead of being ghetto and using a sewing needle I decided to spend the money and get proper piercing needles, which is a decision I do not regret. The needles are sharp and allowed me to easily repierce my ear, but be carefuly because I ended up stabbing one of my fingers getting it out of the package. Either way, for the price they&#x27;re a pretty good buy.</li>
    <li> They work really great i have pierced stuff with them and they are perfect to use . I have used all of them and considering buying more</li>
    <li> I bought these in order to pierce my navel and they worked perfectly. They come in separate packaging so it&#x27;s always a sterile needle before you pierce anything. With belly button piercings, it usually takes a little work if you dont go to a shop, but these went right through the flesh in a snap. I have a really low pain tolerance but the needle went through so fast i didnt even feel it. Shipping was super fast and i got them within 3 days. I definitely recommend buying these.</li>
    <li> I liked  the product, I have used these before and was happy the way things turned out. I would go here again when need more. Thank You</li>
    <li> This is a great buy. The needles are sharp and go right through without any struggle. If you need needles, get these!</li>
    <li> Did it&#x27;s job with enough for if you drop one and don&#x27;t feel comfortable just cleaning it. . . .</li>
    <li> I was super stoked when I got these EARLY! High five for that. They are so ridiculously sharp it&#x27;s incredible. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Pierced my belly button!!(:</li>
    <li> I pierced the third hole in my lobe a couple months ago, works like a charm, a lot of blood but that&#x27;s only to be expected. I have had no sign of infection. These needles are very sterile.</li>
    <li> havent used it yet but they look pretty good</li>
    <li> Sooo These Needles were great ... I pierced my belly button like 5 months ago never got infected. worked like a charm . I hope to be piercing  something new !!</li>
    <li> these needles came very well packaged and professionally done too. Each needle was seperate from the others with a tiny ball of cotton to protect the sharp tips. I pierced my own septum with one and while I do not codone self-piercing, it went very well. The needle was sterile as promised, 6 months later and my piercing is healthy, clean, and was NEVER infected. Very good product!</li>
    <li> I got them on time and they were perfect. No dents or bends. Very sharp and made piercing almost pain free. Will buy from again.</li>
    <li> The quality of these needles where great! Very organized packing and fast shipping! And of corse don&#x27;t forget the great price for these babies! Will Sertenly order again!</li>
    <li> Me and my friend ordered them about a month ago, to pierce our belly buttons. But if you&#x27;re using these to do that too, then MAKE SURE YOU BUY CLAMPS. I used clamps, and mine is basically perfect. My friend didn&#x27;t, and hers is like, too close to the edge, and it&#x27;s crooked. Anyways, they come in a little tiny bag type deal, and allyou gotta do is pop&#x27;em throughh! It did hurt a little bit, like while I was putting it through, but then afterwards,  after I finished, it was WAY worth it, bc it hurts 10x more while you&#x27;re putting it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY reccomend this product. ^-^</li>
    <li> These are awesome they really do come clean unlike someothers I ave bought in the past and did not use because they came dirty and that&#x27;s just gross so yeah anyways these are great I pierced my navel, septum, ears rook and industrial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are awesome buy these and poke your self don&#x27;t pay 20 or more dollars at a piercer for nothing</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly to pierce my septum, came clean and steril. The needles were sharp and came in easy packaging, plus it arrived on time! Very happy with this prodcut!</li>
    <li> So I bought these so I could pierce my tongue and belly button. I did do my tongue and it went through so quick and didn&#x27;t hurt!! I still have to do my belly button but I would suggest these. they&#x27;re completely sterilized and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price!! :) I will definitely be buying more soon!!! :)</li>
    <li> sharp . No pain at all.</li>
    <li> i bought this for a friend as a gift. she loved them and used them all up pretty fast so i guess they were everything she needed for piercings</li>
    <li> I did my top and bottom navel didn&#x27;t hurt really went right through with out a problem its awesome if your looking for something awesome gets these!</li>
    <li> not very sharp i had to struggle to pierce my wifes naval safety ends are paper they do not stay on very well this can be hazardous once the pierce is penetrated risk of stabbing yourself</li>
    <li> Quick service,good quality product, quick, precise communication. Overall an excellent purchase and buying experience , will use again in the future.</li>
    <li> Item was As described! stamped  Steril, individual packed. Very sharp! Went through with ease! I used to reopen lmy abret!</li>
    <li> I was able to pierce two sets of ears and a belly button with these needles and it worked flawlessly every time. Great quality for a great price. Will definitely be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Great needles it ended up coming with ten needle instead of five love them I pierce ears a belly button.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment, good price. I haven&#x27;t gotten to use one yet, but they appear very sharp and to be just the right size. Very excited to use these!</li>
    <li> Great for at home piercing! I did my tongue web and my Monroe! Just debating on what to do next! Love them!</li>
    <li> It was completely the wrong product</li>
    <li> I still havent received this package its been like a month already.... I hope i get this soon and didnt get ripped off.</li>
    <li> My first home piercing and it went great. Nothing to complain about. Sharp, clean and cheap needles, what more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> The piercing needles were great they go in nice and fast. I managed to pierce my friends ears without an infection. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are good for piercing belly button or other areas that require a larger hole...&lt;br /&gt;The lower the gauge the larger the needle (backwards than you would think, the&lt;br /&gt;same as needle sizes used by medical staff.  Was very easy to use.  you do need&lt;br /&gt;a clamp however, if you dont have one, may want to get a kit.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. No complaints. I turned out to be more of a wimp than I thought and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pierce... well, myself.</li>
    <li> I peirce a lot of peoples belly buttons, and i have to say that these are the most sterile, sharp and clean needles i have ever used. Highly recommend. Good quality for the price too!!</li>
    <li> I periced my own lip with them it didnt hurt didnt get a infection and they are super sharp so be careful I sliced my thumb open with one trying to open it.</li>
    <li> even though i sterilized them really good on a few of my piercings i go slight infections but they go through the skin good.</li>
    <li> I used these to pierce my navel. I really like the quality and they were VERY VERY sharp. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I do all my own piercings. Used this to pierce my monroe and my lip, and it was perfect. A LOT less painful than using a safety pin. Very easy to put jewelry in. Great buy, I recommend it to anyone who plans to do a piercing. Makes life a lot easier.</li>
    <li> So, I was bad, and decided I wanted to pierce my navel myself because I couldnt afford the $80 in a shop. I looked up what I needed, watched plenty of videos, and ordered these babies and well, they worked great! Those things were so sharp I barely touched my skin and it started bleeding, I didnt even feel it! They worked, and seem to be sterilized as stated because I havent gotten an infection yet and its been 3wks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that are dumb like me, just a warning, I am the strongest person ever when it comes to seeing blood, needles, gore, whatever. I assist nurses that have come to my house and cut open my grandpas ankle right infront of me. I dont mind getting IV&#x27;s or shots or anything and well, I thought I would have no problem whatsoever poking a needle through myself... I was fine until I saw the needle come up through the skin of my belly. I didnt feel any pain, but as soon as I saw the needle for some reason I nearly blacked out. And no joke, I have NEVER blacked out before. SO if I could do this over again, knowing that I for some reason cant handle poking a needle through myself,  I probably wouldnt have done it myself. Oh, and I have a very high tolerance for pain so it may have been painless to me, but it might be painful to you!</li>
    <li> perfect they where so sharp I did my tongue theywent right through an they made it painless</li>
    <li> These took a little longer to arrive because they were coming from so far away. I didn&#x27;t get the chance to use them right away because of personal issues, but when i did use it, they worked beautifully. Couldn&#x27;t have been happier.</li>
    <li> Great!!  My bf piereced my eye brow and it went right through. Painless....</li>
    <li> These needles worked great on my nipples. Eliminated most pain due to the sharpness. Very sterile, all needles in seperate little plastic pouches with a plastic protector on the tip. Great guide to thread in barbells. Made my piercing quick and easy and will definitely buy again! Oh, and outstanding shipping. Recieved them very quickly and the customer service was phenomenal. Highly reccommend!</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised pierced my lobes with them, razor sharp, no infection (though i washed them and heated them with a flame before hand)</li>
    <li> No complaints, very sharp, and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The needles weren&#x27;t as sharp as they should have been.  Used one to pierce my tongue and the piercer said he never had such a hard time pushing a needle through,  it hurt worse than it should have.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Came on time and is exactly what I paid for. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal! The needles are exactly what the description said; razor sharp.</li>
    <li> great for piercings! The fact that the needles come packaged lets my clients feel safe when they see them before I pierce.</li>
    <li> The small quantity made it easy to order as a sample to determine their quality. They are as described and make DIY piercing safer. Very helpful and convenient.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order mine from Arizona Tattoo Supply but from SS Body Jewelry &amp; Tattoo supply I ordered them on Thursday and got them Monday. They&#x27;re very sharp and go through easily I didn&#x27;t have any problem with sterilization they were each in little sealed packets. Great buy if you&#x27;re looking to do piercings!</li>
    <li> Me trying to pierce my own lip with simply a needle, and no clamps or sterilization, or aftercare was a very bad call on my part. But it is exactly what it states 5 sterilized piercing needles.</li>
    <li> These needles are sharp and easy to use. Quick way to get a piercing just look at them before you use them. Recommend.</li>
    <li> i order this to do a self belly button piercing &amp; let me say that it came way earlier than expected an the needles are perfect for belly button piercing its so sharp it went straight in with out any pain , my belly button never swelled up or  had a problem healing its like its not evan there i would recommend this to EVERYONE !</li>
    <li> So I pierced my belly button by myself and the needle was so sharp that it was really easy. I&#x27;m really happy with my piercing. The shipping was really fast too, I got the package after like 3-4 days!</li>
    <li> I am using this for a belly button piercing. These are great because they are effortless and painless. Remeber its a one time use for your safety but if your going to do it this is an excellent and safe product as I have found out myself.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really sharp and it went in smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;✔Good Price.&lt;br /&gt;✔Arrived On Time</li>

    <li> wow this was great. it worked like magic. it barely even hurt if you do it correctly. highly recommended. go for it!!!</li>
    <li> just what I asked for, 5 needles, all individually packaged. Exactly as described in the picture and in the description.</li>
    <li> they got here in like a week and i loved how they came in an envelope in the mail instead of a box</li>
    <li> Used These To Pierce My Own Septum, And They Were Amazing. ! Very Sharp So It Made The Piercing Very Quick And Almost Painless.. I Also Used These To Pierce My Friends Septum And They Worked Perfectly.. Each Comes In Separate And Sterile Packaging So You Dont Need To Worry About Infection...</li>
    <li> very good deal and showed up on time and was all there and no damage :-)&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering more for sure&lt;br /&gt;thanx guys</li>
    <li> These needles are sharp and pierce well with little to no resistance ... I would have rated it 5 out of , but because  the packages the needles come in do not have a oxygen indicator that shows if the package is been Unsterilized do to puncture of the needle in the packaging.. They can not be used with out having to sterilize them first witch is kind of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;But over ll they are good quality and at a good price..</li>
    <li> work great peirced my belly button with it :)</li>
    <li> Super sharp! Great quality very sterile but i sterilized it again just to be sure. Overall amazing needles will be buying these again soon.</li>
    <li> Amazing I will definitely buy these again. Very sharp and they work amazing.</li>
    <li> made for perfect piercings everytime. my husband is a piercer and hes good at his craft, but we have gotten poor quality before and it makes for an all around bad time.these are good quality and i have very happy metal filed ears now.</li>
    <li> i pierced mine, and a few other belly buttons with these and they were clean and worked great.. I would defiantly use them again</li>
    <li> They got the job done!! I used it to pierce my belly button. They came quick. I got 4 extra needles now, trying to decide what my next piercing is.</li>
