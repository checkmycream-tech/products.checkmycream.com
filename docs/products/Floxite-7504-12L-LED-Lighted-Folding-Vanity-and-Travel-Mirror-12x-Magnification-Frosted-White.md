      <li>However, it would have been perfect if an electric power cord was included in the product since it is operable by battery or electricity.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly for me</li>
      <li>I AM VERY PLEASED!</li>
      <li>Just what I was looking for, great for travel.</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I am quite happy with it.</li>
      <li>This mirror is great for traveling.</li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>Great folding mirror, good magnification.  </li>
      <li>Nice size for travel.</li>
      <li>Love the folding arm and it</li>
      <li>I saw a lighted mirror at a department store, but was 4 times the price, glad I found this one.</li>
      <li>but for my suitcase it will be ok.</li>
      <li>It would be great even if I wasn&#x27;t older .  </li>
      <li>I am older and this lighted magnified mirror is great.</li>
      <li>so keep a good supply at hand if you want to keep the lights as bright as possible.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the mirror was fine for a 12x, the size was fine, and it seemed sturdy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it once at home and the lighting was good and didn&#x27;t seem to get burning hot after being on for several minutes.</li>
      <li>The pivot joint rotates easier than the old one; I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good thing or not - if it doesn&#x27;t break, I guess it will be a good thing.</li>
      <li>The regular mirror is fine but the magnifying side is too strong.</li>
      <li>I like that the height is adjustable rather than just on a straight stand.  </li>
      <li>I appreciated that I was granted permission by the seller to return it.</li>
      <li>The lights seem to be a little more yellow than in the old one, but they are okay for my purposes.</li>
      <li>The size seems just right for not taking up too much room in the suitcase and yet large enough to allow me to put my makeup on well when on the road.</li>
      <li>One thing I like about this new one better is that the magnifying mirror seems to have less distortion than my old one.</li>
      <li>The only thing I think that would improve it is if it had a few more lights around the face.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>the lights actually prevent you from seeing a clear view of the mirror.</li>
      <li>The only down-side is that it eats battery&#x27;s alive</li>
      <li>the 15x is just a little too much.  </li>

    <li> Just what I was looking for, great for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for traveling because I the Floxite brand.  I like the lights and the adjustable arm but the mirror is very small and the 15x is just a little too much.  I should have ordered the 10x and a larger diameter like my other makeup mirror  but for my suitcase it will be ok.</li>
    <li> The regular mirror is fine but the magnifying side is too strong. Also the lights are poorly placed. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for me</li>
    <li> Lights are not bright enough, and there is a central shadow!  I can take it on trips in a pinch, but will not use it for everyday.</li>
    <li> It looks like it will do the job. I haven&#x27;t yet traveled and used it.The size seems just right for not taking up too much room in the suitcase and yet large enough to allow me to put my makeup on well when on the road. I&#x27;ve used it once at home and the lighting was good and didn&#x27;t seem to get burning hot after being on for several minutes. This is replacing a larger square 4 bulb mirror I&#x27;ve been carrying around. I hate how much time it takes for that one to cool off enough to pack it again. It&#x27;s bigger and heavier than this one.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great for traveling. I am quite happy with it. The only thing I think that would improve it is if it had a few more lights around the face. It is a bit dim, and that makes it tough to see when using tweezers.</li>
    <li> Great folding mirror, good magnification.  I like that the height is adjustable rather than just on a straight stand.  Also can be used with batteries or plug in but that cord has to be purchased separately.</li>
    <li> I had a folding mirror like this before, which I used for several years, but the pivot joint broke when I twisted it the wrong way. So, I ordered this as a replacement. The lights seem to be a little more yellow than in the old one, but they are okay for my purposes. The pivot joint rotates easier than the old one; I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good thing or not - if it doesn&#x27;t break, I guess it will be a good thing. One thing I like about this new one better is that the magnifying mirror seems to have less distortion than my old one. All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am older and this lighted magnified mirror is great. It would be great even if I wasn&#x27;t older .  It folds away, so you don&#x27;t have to have it out all the time. I saw a lighted mirror at a department store, but was 4 times the price, glad I found this one.</li>
    <li> Product worked as expected.  However, it would have been perfect if an electric power cord was included in the product since it is operable by battery or electricity.</li>
    <li> This folding Vanity mirror has all the features my wife was looking for in a travel mirror.  The only down-side is that it eats battery&#x27;s alive so keep a good supply at hand if you want to keep the lights as bright as possible.</li>
    <li> the lights actually prevent you from seeing a clear view of the mirror. Not happy with this product</li>
    <li> Great. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I returned the mirror because the lighting was not continuous around the mirror; the lights were placed at points around the mirror. Therefore, the lighting was not adequate for me. Otherwise, the mirror was fine for a 12x, the size was fine, and it seemed sturdy. I appreciated that I was granted permission by the seller to return it.</li>
    <li> Nice size for travel. Wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  It isn&#x27;t too small or too big.  Love the folding arm and it&lt;br /&gt;can adjust in a lot of ways  I AM VERY PLEASED!</li>
