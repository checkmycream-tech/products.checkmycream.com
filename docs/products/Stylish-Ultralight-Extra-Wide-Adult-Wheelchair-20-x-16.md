      <li>Great wheelchair for the price.  </li>
      <li>Great Purchase</li>
      <li>The leg parts are great as they are padded.</li>
      <li>I took it on a cruise to Alaska, it was great.</li>
      <li>I now have a bitof piece-of -mind knowing if we need a good wheelchair we have one.</li>
      <li>It is really a good looking chair.  </li>
      <li>The chair was of good quality</li>
      <li>Very pleased with purchase.</li>
      <li>We are very pleased with our order.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of adjustments to make in order to fit the rider, but once done it is great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice wheelchair.  </li>
      <li>Lot of nice people out there that helped.</li>
      <li>It also is very easy to operate if you are manuovering yourself.</li>
      <li>Again the chair itself, sans belt and anti-tippers, is a very good chair and has worked very well.  </li>
      <li>I sat in it almost eight hours a day for a month and this wheelchair was great, easy to use and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Since he should be able to transition out of a wheelchair in about two months, we are not worried about it    </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Stylish, Ultra-Light,</li>
      <li>It releases on its own &amp; folds up - bringing the armrests &amp; wheels together in one smooth motion.  </li>
      <li>She says that she has more freedom and greater mobility since using it.</li>
      <li>So, when she sat in this chair (that I didn&#x27;t have to disassemble to shorten), she was pleased.</li>
      <li>Buy what you need and spend more if you must.</li>
      <li>A wheelchair would have been great in this instance where I had to steady him</li>
      <li>Happy to report a high grade for this chair.</li>
      <li>first I thought it was a good wheelchair for the price.  </li>
      <li>and we are sure it will do the job we intend it for (6 weeks of post-surgery light use).  </li>
      <li>This chair would probably be a better fit for a person that was not over 6 ft tall.  </li>
      <li>but the wider seat is a better fit.</li>
      <li>I really can not recommend this chair, though the chair itself is a good one - sturdy, and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wheels come off and on easily if you&#x27;d need to remove them for loading or storage or to replace.</li>
      <li>You can roll &amp; turn this chair easily, even when it&#x27;s folded.</li>
      <li>, the hubcaps fall off easily.  </li>
      <li>Folding it up is supper easy and being in my 50&#x27;s the weight of lifting the chair into the car was a concern.</li>
      <li>my assistant says it is easy to push.</li>
      <li>The wheelchair is SO easy to use and assemble.</li>
      <li>Easy for someone to push, and it&#x27;s quite comfortable.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s light in weight and easy to collapsed and lift into a car trunk for travel.</li>
      <li>but it seems perfectly good, brand new, sturdy, well made, light,</li>
      <li>Smooth ride.  </li>
      <li>i am so happy we can adjust them, as i have short legs.</li>
      <li>With its strategic design, the user can comfortably wheel around through store aisles, in handicapstalls, etc without getting snagged or stopped up (even when using arms to propel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mom does not feel secure when she goes to sit in this model.</li>
      <li>the seat widths available.  </li>
      <li>Not as smooth as invacare models.</li>
      <li>This is light yet sturdy.</li>
      <li>, he has found it quite comfortable during hours of extended sitting.    </li>
      <li>Looking at the stats of this wheelchair from a loving care-givers&#x27; perspective, I liked the fact that it&#x27;s got a wider-than-normal seat &amp; full range of functions - plus can still fold relatively flat (to fit in the trunk of my car or to tuck away in a closet when not in use).</li>
      <li>also being able to put the leg parts up and down is great.</li>
      <li>He has recently started back to work and finds it best to spend most of the time in the wheelchair.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to assemble/take apart, lightweight, nice-looking, comfortable and very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>This Wheelchair is very durable, very well put together and very easy to push.</li>
      <li>It is great for heavy people like me.</li>
      <li>This is a really stable and comfortable chair.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am satisfied with both the quality of this chair - and the fact that it is comfortable for the person who will be using it.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am satisfied with both the quality of this chair - and the fact that it is comfortable for the person who will be using it.</li>
      <li>and before I could get it fixed, it ripped the top part where the backing wraps around the chair and is held on with a grommet.  </li>
      <li>If your loved one needs to hold on to arms to sit/stand, I would recommend full arms rather than this model that has half arms.</li>
      <li>After 2 weeks I got the right legs but no anti-tippers.</li>
      <li>Luckily I was able to find them and put them back on.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a nice looking chair at a reasonable price that does the job and which I would not hesitate recommending.  </li>
      <li>my back is very comfortable as it is padded and the seat also.</li>
      <li>The positive aspect is that he can roll right up close to just about any desk or table.  </li>
      <li>Lightweight and able to be carried short distances if needed.</li>
      <li>I read several reviews about this chair before buying and have been pleased with the construction</li>
      <li>Firstly, the materials OVERALL (from the metal frame &amp; plastic parts to the fabrics of the seat and leg-rests) are ALL top quality.</li>
      <li>This chair fits the bill exactly.  </li>
      <li>This one I can handle by my self, which makes me more independent.  </li>
      <li>All ok but different brand.</li>
      <li>This chair is more than up to the task of  occasionally daily use for transportation.  </li>
      <li>This is a good wheelchair, but not what you would call \\&quot;heavy</li>
      <li>The wheelchair was delivered very quick, came completely put to gather ready for use.</li>
      <li>There are MANY positive aspects that you just won&#x27;t find in lesser models.</li>
      <li>If you need a full-time wheelchair I&#x27;m sure you would be looking at custom fit or more expensive options.  </li>
      <li>This chair easily goes in &amp; out of my trunk - or the backseat of my (mid-sized) without a big hassle, although the foot rests must be removed first.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He is a large man (6&#x27;2\\&quot;, 220</li>
      <li>I love the wider size, it makes it extra comfortable to sit in for long periods of time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough for the rider to maneuver manually - without draining too much energy.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good chair for a bigger person (20inch wide seat and 300lb capacity) at a reasonable price</li>
      <li>The extra width of the chair allowed him to sit comfortably.  </li>
      <li>It appears sturdy and handles very well.</li>
      <li>This chair has really be thought out.</li>
      <li>We needed the attachment that would lift the leg from sitting position up straight like in the picture.  </li>
      <li>I really like this wheelchair.</li>
      <li>Very easy to manuver even in tight spaces.</li>
      <li>The side bars to the seat will frequently not fall into the support making it easy to fall.</li>
      <li>The weight capacity was higher than most chairs we looked at for similar price and came with more features than other chairs of similar price.</li>
      <li>The material that the seat and back are made of is very substantial and the seat is very comfortable, even for long trips.</li>
      <li>x 16\\&quot; size would be far more comfortable and practical - especially considering that we&#x27;ll potentially be using it long</li>
      <li>I bought it due to surgery on my foot and found it easy to use.  </li>
      <li>So just like my crutches and cane that I keep in my closet for those days when my old Judo injury causes my knee to go out, or my husband has another bout with dizziness, we&#x27;re ready.</li>
      <li>We wanted the wider seat because my seat is wide and I measured my office chart for what was comfortable.</li>
      <li>In addition the black plugs at the top of the front wheel housing come have popped off several times, the first one when I took it on the airplane.  </li>
      <li>If I want to continue to use it, I need to make sure my leg isn&#x27;t anywhere close to the wheel, but that is not easy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this in early September and by mid-October the anti-tippers and belt STILL had not gotten to me (despite 2 separate phone calls, and being assured they were on the way).  As of the beginning of November still not here.  If you need the anti-tippers (ie. if you have no one to help push you EVERY time) I really can not recommend this chair, though the chair itself is a good one - sturdy, and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update: As of the beginning of June 2012, we still have not received the belt and anti-tippers.  Again the chair itself, sans belt and anti-tippers, is a very good chair and has worked very well.  Still would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Great wheelchair for the price.  I bought it due to surgery on my foot and found it easy to use.  I needed to get around in my school building after my surgery.  I sat in it almost eight hours a day for a month and this wheelchair was great, easy to use and comfortable.</li>
    <li> This wheel chair was purchased for my 88 year old uncle. The one the VA gave him wasn&#x27;t wide enough and it didn&#x27;t fit. He is a large man (6&#x27;2\\&quot;, 220 lbs.)The extra width plus the leg supports and the ability to raise the leg supports has mad a huge difference for him.</li>
    <li> Be careful when opening this wheelchair. The side bars to the seat will frequently not fall into the support making it easy to fall. Not as smooth as invacare models. Is wide enough to accomodate my larger mother. Heavier than expected. If your loved one needs to hold on to arms to sit/stand, I would recommend full arms rather than this model that has half arms. Mom does not feel secure when she goes to sit in this model.</li>
    <li> Outsanding wheelchair as it is alot lighter then my old chair.  This one I can handle by my self, which makes me more independent.  It is really a good looking chair.  I took it on a cruise to Alaska, it was great. Thank you Amazon for helping me find the perfect wheelchair.</li>
    <li> I got this wheelchair for my son, who needs it for going to the hospital.  It is easy to assemble/take apart, lightweight, nice-looking, comfortable and very sturdy.  I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a good wheelchair, but not what you would call \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot;.  Maximum weight is 300 pounds, so don&#x27;t push the limits. It will get the job done and is built well. Lightweight and able to be carried short distances if needed. I recommend it, but do not put a 350 pouind person in a 300 pound chair. Buy what you need and spend more if you must.</li>
    <li> This review has the caveat that it covers the wheelchair that EVA Medical Groups LLC sometimes substitutes for the Everest and Jennings model listed.  I say sometimes because I see from another review that mine was not an isolated incident. The only complaint I have is that the substitute did not come with the anti-tippers advertised (but Amazon quickly and professionally made an adjustment once I calmly explained what had happened.)  The other features were identical to the those advertised for the E&amp;J model and otherwise appear to be almost identical products.    The chair was bought for my adult son who had extensive foot reconstruction surgery following an accident.   He is 6 ft 3 in tall and weighs about 325 lbs.   The extra width of the chair allowed him to sit comfortably.  He has recently started back to work and finds it best to spend most of the time in the wheelchair.  This wheelchair has arms that hinge up and out of the way.  This feature has both a pro and con.  The positive aspect is that he can roll right up close to just about any desk or table.  The negative aspect is that the latch mechanisms for the arms are rather loose, coming unlatched frequently when trying to lift the chair by the arms and into a vehicle.    At 325 lbs, he his slightly over the chair&#x27;s rating but after eight weeks of constant use, there has been no mechanical component showing undue strain because of weight.  At his height, the range of adjustment on the legs was not long enough.   We had to rig on some metal stock for extra length and then move move both leg pads to the same side so it could adequately support his injured (and long) leg in a horizontal position. This chair would probably be a better fit for a person that was not over 6 ft tall.  Other than that modification, he has found it quite comfortable during hours of extended sitting.    One other downside is that this chair was obviously not built (or advertised) for both constant and long-term use. That is probablya trade-off for the lighter weight.  This chair is more than up to the task of  occasionally daily use for transportation.  As I said above, there has been no mechanical complaint except for the arm latch design.   However the fabric is beginning to show some very slight strain at the seams.  Once again, my son is slightly above the weight limit and he uses this as his main chair at work.  Since he should be able to transition out of a wheelchair in about two months, we are not worried about it    Overall, it is a nice looking chair at a reasonable price that does the job and which I would not hesitate recommending.  I still have to wonder, however, if there are any quality differences between this chair and the one I actually placed the order for.</li>
    <li> All ok but different brand. May be comparable but not a regular buyer of chairs. This item was not the advertised item .</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT EVEREST AND JENNINGS AS ADVERTISED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was a good wheelchair for the price.  I didn&#x27;t like the feature that the arm lifts, but I knew it was that way when I bought it, and I chose to buy it anyway.  Also, the material that the back and seat are made of a fabric; it is cooler than vinyl but also subject to soiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, within a year, the stitching on the back came unraveled.  Because of this the back separated from the chair and before I could get it fixed, it ripped the top part where the backing wraps around the chair and is held on with a grommet.  Then I used it with the back flapping thinking I would soon take it in and get the back sewn.  However, before I did this, one of the side panels broke loose and started flapping against the wheel.  At this point I considered it junk not worth repairing.  I continued to use it just around the house and the flapping panel broke all together.  So now it has one wheel exposed.  If I want to continue to use it, I need to make sure my leg isn&#x27;t anywhere close to the wheel, but that is not easy. I plan to dispose of it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hubcaps fall off easily.  In addition the black plugs at the top of the front wheel housing come have popped off several times, the first one when I took it on the airplane.  Luckily I was able to find them and put them back on.</li>
    <li> Being a heavy woman whose ability to walk long distances is over. I needed something to get around on trips that would not give my poor husband too much grief.  This is just what I needed. I would recommend it to any one needing similar transportation.</li>
    <li> This Wheelchair is very durable, very well put together and very easy to push. It also is very easy to operate if you are manuovering yourself. The material that the seat and back are made of is very substantial and the seat is very comfortable, even for long trips. I like that the arms swing away and that the legs raise up, if you want them to, you can also take them off if you don&#x27;t want to use them at all. I would definately recommend this chair to anyone wanting to buy one. I love the wider size, it makes it extra comfortable to sit in for long periods of time. Great Purchase</li>
    <li> We received this item on time. I am sorry to say the packaging was substandard and the box was falling apart. The chair was of good quality but we had to return it due to the size being wrong. Our fault not there&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I needed a little bit wider chair, and not too expensive.  This chair fits the bill exactly.  Easy for someone to push, and it&#x27;s quite comfortable.  Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with our order. The chair is lightweight, comes with features like swing away arm rests and leg rests. It&#x27;s durable construction. Very easy to manuver even in tight spaces. The arm rests are paded as are the leg rests. We bought this for &amp;#34;just-in-case needed&amp;#34; after I had a leg injury and using crutches was difficult at times not to mention also tiring and recently my large husband had a case of Vertigo and could barely stand up. A wheelchair would have been great in this instance where I had to steady him so he wouldn&#x27;t fall on the way to the car and then to the doctor. We also have elderly parents and wanted the flexibility of having a wheelchair if they visted. The weight capacity was higher than most chairs we looked at for similar price and came with more features than other chairs of similar price. Only the leg rests have to be attached and that is extremely simple. It has  a roll back feature so if the chair gets tipped backwards it won&#x27;t fall back all the way..also not standard on other chairs we looked at. The wheels come off and on easily if you&#x27;d need to remove them for loading or storage or to replace. This chair has really be thought out. Comes with a wrench-like tool to use on the chair and an instruction manuel. Even the pocked on the back of the chair is not on all chairs we considered. Folding it up is supper easy and being in my 50&#x27;s the weight of lifting the chair into the car was a concern. This is light yet sturdy. We wanted the wider seat because my seat is wide and I measured my office chart for what was comfortable. My husband is a large although not wide person but the wider seat is a better fit. You don&#x27;t want the sides of the chair pinching on your hips or thighs if you have to be stuck in the chair for awhile.  Only one door in our home will not accomidate the chair but all others will and we&#x27;re talking about narrow hallways and tight corners we could maneuver through when trying out the chair. I now have a bitof piece-of -mind knowing if we need a good wheelchair we have one. So just like my crutches and cane that I keep in my closet for those days when my old Judo injury causes my knee to go out, or my husband has another bout with dizziness, we&#x27;re ready.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wheel chair when mine broke unexpectedly.  It gave me everything I needed at a wonderful price.  And for once the seat is big enough.</li>
    <li> I ordered a Wheelchair on 2/19/09 and I received it on 2/24/09. It was not the Wheelchair that Amazon had on the web site. They shipped the wrong legs and no anti-tippers. After 2 weeks I got the right legs but no anti-tippers. Than they shipped the wrong ones and a week latter I git another set of Anti-tippers and they were the wrong ones also. I called them on 3/19/09 and was told that they send me a new Wheelchair with all the wright parts and I have to pack up the old one with all of the wrong parts and send it abck to them when I get the paper work. A the last thing they have dropped the price $40.00. We will see how long it takes to get this done.</li>
    <li> Limited mobility not only affects the patient, but also the immediate family and/or care provider. Looking at the stats of this wheelchair from a loving care-givers&#x27; perspective, I liked the fact that it&#x27;s got a wider-than-normal seat &amp; full range of functions - plus can still fold relatively flat (to fit in the trunk of my car or to tuck away in a closet when not in use). It&#x27;s extremely portable - while still providing the large wheels with grips in the back so the user can \\&quot;wheel\\&quot; themselves around - all in under 35 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;Stylish, Ultra-Light, Extra Wide\\&quot; wheelchair really IS everything it claims to be. (The brand of the chair we received is \\&quot;Everest &amp; Jennings\\&quot;.) Amazon has an extensive selection of wheelchairs. From portable, non-electric fold-up models... to reclining king-sized luxury rigs - they are priced starting at around $100 for the bare minimum and can reach upwards of a couple thousand bucks. After renting an 18\\&quot; standard wheelchair, and then living with a lightweight \\&quot;travel\\&quot; chair for a month, we decided that this 20\\&quot; x 16\\&quot; size would be far more comfortable and practical - especially considering that we&#x27;ll potentially be using it long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came time to purchase this model vs. a standard 18\\&quot; version (for $150 less)... we spent a little more, in hopes of getting higher quality (and an extra 2\\&quot; of seat width).  After living with it and taking it on many outings - over the past several months - it is clear that this specific wheelchair WAS worth the extra hundred and fifty bucks. There are MANY positive aspects that you just won&#x27;t find in lesser models. Firstly, the materials OVERALL (from the metal frame &amp; plastic parts to the fabrics of the seat and leg-rests) are ALL top quality. Despite weighing in at only 33lbs, this wheelchair is STURDY and gives a secure feeling when sitting or rolling around (due in  part to the slightly wider wheel base, I believe). Here are a few other perks that you just won&#x27;t find in the less expensive \\&quot;standard\\&quot; (18\\&quot;) sized models:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The arm-rests are not only padded... they also fold back without much exertion - to allow the chair to be rolled all the way up to a desk or a dinner table.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s light enough for the rider to maneuver manually - without draining too much energy.&lt;br /&gt;* The detachable foot/leg rests are padded as well - and also adjustable. You can elevate one or both legs at varying angles depending on your desired position. They also have &#x60;extension&#x27; movement so you can make them longer or shorter based on leg length.&lt;br /&gt;* The seat &#x60;locks&#x27; itself down to a static position when fully open.  By pulling the arms of the chair apart from each other - and then pushing down on both sides of the seat... It makes an audible click - which means that the chair will not fold up on you as you sit in it.&lt;br /&gt;* Both the seat cushion AND the seat back are pliable - but also offer a thick internal padding. It gives the feeling of sitting in a firm, yet comfy chair - rather than a flimsy piece of canvas - or some hard, uncomfortable plastic.&lt;br /&gt;* To close the chair (from its &#x60;locked&#x27; sitting position) you simply pull up on the middle of the seat with both hands. It releases on its own &amp; folds up - bringing the armrests &amp; wheels together in one smooth motion.  This chair easily goes in &amp; out of my trunk - or the backseat of my (mid-sized) without a big hassle, although the foot rests must be removed first.&lt;br /&gt;* You can roll &amp; turn this chair easily, even when it&#x27;s folded. Larger than normal front wheels &amp; castors REALLY make navigating in smaller spaces FEASABLE - whether someone is pushing the chair from behind, or you are &#x60;wheeling around&#x27; under your own power.&lt;br /&gt;* I was concerned that the &#x60;wider&#x27; width of this chair would not fit through some types of smaller interior doors or narrow hallways, etc. That is not the case at all. With its strategic design, the user can comfortably wheel around through store aisles, in handicapstalls, etc without getting snagged or stopped up (even when using arms to propel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the MAJOR components (i.e. frame, axles, arm &amp; leg rests, front and back wheels, etc) are seemingly well made. The black fabric of the seat &amp; back cushion is comfortable, durable and so far... low-maintenance; it even has a large pocket in the back for paperwork, small items, etc.  There was some concern over the &#x60;anti-tippers&#x27; (which prevent the wheelchair from falling backwards while going up an incline) being too short. But, no worries... even those are extendable and can be raised or lowered based your personal requirements (with a basic screwdriver). Overall, I am satisfied with both the quality of this chair - and the fact that it is comfortable for the person who will be using it. We both agree that this specific model is worth the extra cash. Whether it&#x27;s temporary or permanent, this wheelchair has provided flexibility, comfort and piece-of-mind.stalls, etc without getting snagged or stopped up (even when using arms to propel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the MAJOR components (i.e. frame, axles, arm &amp; leg rests, front and back wheels, etc) are seemingly well made.

    <li> The wheelchair was delivered very quick, came completely put to gather ready for use. The only problem I have with the chair is it was advertised with a 300 lb. rating but on the frame of the chair the sticker reads 250 lbs. We will see by future use if that 50 lb. difference will make a difference.</li>
    <li> Well packed and delivered.  This is a really stable and comfortable chair.  There are a lot of adjustments to make in order to fit the rider, but once done it is great.  Great maneuverability and sturdiness.  Smooth ride.  A little heavy, but what do you expect for a good quality chair.</li>
    <li> We purchased this wheelchair after my husband had leg surgery.  It is perfect for the job.  Not too heavy or bulky for a 105lb woman to put into a car alone, yet sturdy enough for a 6ft, 220lb man to ride in.  Yes, it is not the advertized brand but it seems perfectly good, brand new, sturdy, well made, light, and we are sure it will do the job we intend it for (6 weeks of post-surgery light use).  If you need a full-time wheelchair I&#x27;m sure you would be looking at custom fit or more expensive options.  The leg support could be longer for a 6ft tall man and they say to \\&quot;see a dealer\\&quot; to raise the seat, though it comes with a tool to do it (but no instructions for that).  Other than that, the minimal assembly was very simple.  I would definitely recommend this for somebody looking for temporary or occasional use - cheaper than renting and an investment if there are chances of needing it again....&lt;br /&gt;Note the seat widths available.  We got a 20\\&quot; for a 220lb 6ft man and it is quite roomy enough.</li>
    <li> I really like this wheelchair. It is great for heavy people like me. The leg parts are great as they are padded. i have a problem with my legs, so i need this padding. also being able to put the leg parts up and down is great. i am so happy we can adjust them, as i have short legs. my assistant says it is easy to push. my back is very comfortable as it is padded and the seat also.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother who was being over-billed for the wheel-chair provided by the hospital. I&#x27;m very impressed with the anti-tipping mechanism which the other, more expensive wheel chair did not have, which makes it impossible to fall backwards and konk your head on the ground. It comes set up for a taller person and you can lower it with the included tool. Fortunately mom is tall and her previous chair came set up for a shorter person and her knees hurt pushing herself around with her feet. So, when she sat in this chair (that I didn&#x27;t have to disassemble to shorten), she was pleased. The materials are not of the highest grade--but you get what you pay for. This chair has canvas seat and back whereas the previous one had a leather-like vinyl, and the metal is not chromed but the price for the wheel chair she had was $200 more to purchase. So, all in all it&#x27;s a good chair for a bigger person (20inch wide seat and 300lb capacity) at a reasonable price (if you want the leg attachments with pads as shown.)</li>
    <li> Delivery was great. We did have a problem with the leg attachments.  We needed the attachment that would lift the leg from sitting position up straight like in the picture.  We bought this wheelchair back in August 2012?  The pictured wheelchair was what we needed.  The description on the ad was the problem.  So we called the company that sold it and they couldn&#x27;t help.  So we called the company that made it and they called the company that sold it.  And they straightened it out between themselves with a conference call that included me.  So they did finally  send the correct attachments and now all is well.  It&#x27;s a nice wheelchair.  It had to roll on gravel driveways and in different situations, but it did handle them well.  But it is kinda heavy for me to put in the car by myself  But I did when I had to.  Lot of nice people out there that helped. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair is SO easy to use and assemble. All I needed to do was hook the foot attachments. I definitely gets me to where I&#x27;m going to.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Mother&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> My wife has a sever ankle sprain that will require a prolonged period off her feet. I read several reviews about this chair before buying and have been pleased with the construction, it&#x27;s light in weight and easy to collapsed and lift into a car trunk for travel. We appreciate the slightly wider size of the chair even though my wife is rather petite. It appears sturdy and handles very well. There are other heavier and cheaper wheelchairs out there, buy I consider this an excellent value.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom who has trouble moving around. She loves it. She says that she has more freedom and greater mobility since using it.</li>
    <li> Put the new chair to the test last week: doctor&#x27;s appointment for my wife in a snowstorm and me with a hard cast on my right hand after thumb surgery---chair easy to remove from car, unfold, and footrests fast to attach and detach. Happy to report a high grade for this chair.</li>
