### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So Happy!!</li>
      <li>If this happens its excellent</li>
      <li>but that has not happened with this product so i am happy with that.</li>
      <li>cause I could feel it did a great job of moisturizing all by itself.</li>
      <li>Keep in the refrigerator as suggested - works great.</li>
      <li>think I&#x27;ll skip this product and just use a good sun block and moisturizer....</li>
      <li>I love using this product!  </li>
      <li>Bottle came as seen in the picture, and also was nice that the cap was secured with a film tape.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this serum, but I liked the ingredients</li>
      <li>At night  I use a bit more to make kind of like a mask.  </li>
      <li>Makes your skin very smooth and kills a ton of wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I love this serum.</li>
      <li>I like this serum better than others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Works better than any product i have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I have continued to do this more</li>
      <li>Product is moisturizing and refreshing.</li>
      <li>and you still need to use a moisturizer on top of this product for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is interesting and the verdict is still out.  </li>
      <li>Not quite sure how well</li>
      <li>Big difference works great.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and feels light, not greasy.</li>
      <li>It looked smooth and feels silky.  </li>
      <li>The first time I put this on, I thought ok this is like all the others I have used</li>
      <li>Firming and refreshing - highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Has a great texture which works well with other ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Also, my face firmed up tremendously because my wrinkles were reduced.</li>
      <li>Overall, very pleased with the purchase and the quality of the serum.</li>
      <li>The texture is really nice and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t dry like a layer on my face</li>
      <li>I rarely wear make up</li>
      <li>My hands looked SO much better the following morning.  </li>
      <li>this is working seems pretty sticky.</li>
      <li>This serum is clear and scentless, applied it to my face and it absorbed quickly, could tell that it moisturized my skin where I applied it.</li>
      <li>have noticed that my face, neck and hands look brighter and have a better texture despite the dry winter weather.  </li>
      <li>Have a large sunspot on my face that required coverup and then foundation and the spot was still visible.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite, just not what I expected</li>
      <li>But after about 3 weeks, I really noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Did more than I expected.</li>
      <li>If you apply too much it will feel like a mask or really gooey on the skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on a bit thick and feels kind of sticky if you use to much</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin looks more vibrant and small fine lines I&#x27;ve had are less visible, this vitamin c serum really gets the job done!</li>
      <li>far, I really like this product,</li>
      <li>I am 50 years old, and I have tried more than a few</li>
      <li>So far it looks like its been helping with my hyper-pigmentation from acne and sun spots.</li>
      <li>This serum has lightened this spot so foundation completely covers it up.</li>
      <li>Worse, the product did nothing for my skin, doesn&#x27;t get absorbed, sat on my skin like egg wash and actually made it more wrinkled.</li>
      <li>I went for this new product simply because it contained an additional vitamin.</li>
      <li>The dry winter weather has really been drying out my hands.  </li>
      <li>My pores have gotten smaller and my facial contours are definitely much firmer.</li>
      <li>(and I have used practically every major brand).  </li>
      <li>But if you apply a small amount it will soak right in.  </li>
      <li>At night I let it get a little gooey since my skin has really benefited from this amount at night.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It brightens my skin and adds a little shine, but not too much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I gave this as a gift to a friend and she adores it.  She said she has noticed a difference in facial smoothness since using it.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure how well this is working seems pretty sticky.</li>
    <li> Works better than any product i have ever tried. I am 50 years old, and I have tried more than a few</li>
    <li> I use this in my face serum mixtures.  Has a great texture which works well with other ingredients.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The texture is really nice and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t dry like a layer on my face and I can feel that it absorbs well. My pores have gotten smaller and my facial contours are definitely much firmer. My skin looks more vibrant and small fine lines I&#x27;ve had are less visible, this vitamin c serum really gets the job done! Used it once in the morning and once at night everyday, didn&#x27;t even have to put moisturizer over it cause I could feel it did a great job of moisturizing all by itself.</li>
    <li> It is interesting and the verdict is still out.  I&#x27;ve yet to see any visible difference. I plan to continue the regimen because some things just take a little longer to show up than others. For me that is usually the case.</li>
    <li> I tried the anti aging serum for one week. I applied it once a day. After a few days, I noticed the sagging around my eyes improved dramatically. Also, my face firmed up tremendously because my wrinkles were reduced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not sure that I see a difference using this product? Maybe it&#x27;s helping my skin maybe not?&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a bit thick and feels kind of sticky if you use to much and you still need to use a moisturizer on top of this product for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll skip this product and just use a good sun block and moisturizer....</li>
    <li> This serum is clear and scentless, applied it to my face and it absorbed quickly, could tell that it moisturized my skin where I applied it. Also could feel that it helped firm up the area I applied as well. So far it looks like its been helping with my hyper-pigmentation from acne and sun spots. Bottle came as seen in the picture, and also was nice that the cap was secured with a film tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I really like this product, can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects on my skin that has a bit of sun damage from playing golf.</li>
    <li> It arrived before estimated date, packaged well and with a tamper proof seal.  Other purchasers of this product state no smell, however,  I do experience an oder that is alittle unpleasant upon application, but disappears quickly.  I have been using it for approx 2wks.  I can not really comment as of yet.  I know miracles do not happen over night.  I use it 2x a day.  In the morning I use a tiny amount because it can be alittle gooey.  At night  I use a bit more to make kind of like a mask.  I do have sensative skin and practically everything makes me break out but that has not happened with this product so i am happy with that.</li>
    <li> No miracle...just takes time to improve skin.  I thought the serum would help brown spots, but nothing noticeable has happened to mine.  This serum does help improve the facial texture.  Like I said, just takes time.</li>
    <li> I like this serum better than others that I&#x27;ve tried. It goes on smoothly and feels light, not greasy. I believe it gives my skin a softer and shinier glow.</li>
    <li> Firming and refreshing - highly recommend it! Keep in the refrigerator as suggested - works great.</li>
    <li> Did more than I expected. Have a large sunspot on my face that required coverup and then foundation and the spot was still visible. This serum has lightened this spot so foundation completely covers it up. So Happy!!</li>
    <li> Product is moisturizing and refreshing. Still waiting to see if skin tightens and the darks spots fade. If this happens its excellent</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it made a difference.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite, just not what I expected</li>
    <li> Big difference works great. Been using it for a few months but this stuff does work. Makes your skin very smooth and kills a ton of wrinkles. Especially the ones around your eyes.</li>
    <li> The first time I put this on, I thought ok this is like all the others I have used (and I have used practically every major brand).  But after about 3 weeks, I really noticed a difference in my skin.  It looked smooth and feels silky.  I love this serum. Just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I went for this new product simply because it contained an additional vitamin. I was skeptical of the product when it arrived(poor packaging, labeling, as if it had been put together in a hurry!) Worse, the product did nothing for my skin, doesn&#x27;t get absorbed, sat on my skin like egg wash and actually made it more wrinkled. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> I love using this product!  It has been a few weeks since I started to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply in the morning after washing and toner.  It requires a very small amount and soaks right into the skin.  Then I apply my daytime moisturizer and eye cream.  My makeup stays on and has not been affected by this additional product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also apply at night.  At night time I apply a slightly thicker amount before putting on my night cream.  I have also applied it to my hands before going to sleep. The dry winter weather has really been drying out my hands.  My hands looked SO much better the following morning.  I have continued to do this more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my face, neck and hands look brighter and have a better texture despite the dry winter weather.  I will continue to use this.  I highly recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a few comments about how thick it is. This is a serum and a little goes a long way.  If you apply too much it will feel like a mask or really gooey on the skin.  But if you apply a small amount it will soak right in.  At night I let it get a little gooey since my skin has really benefited from this amount at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stored this in the fridge.</li>
    <li> skin feels like silk after using</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this serum, but I liked the ingredients so I gave it a try. It is an amber colored liquid that is a bit thick and has a sticky quality. Once applied, I can feel the tightening of my skin and for a few minutes it is tacky to the touch. Once it adsorbs, I like the look and feel of this serum. It brightens my skin and adds a little shine, but not too much. I rarely wear make up so this makes me feel like I have added a layer of protection to my skin. Overall, very pleased with the purchase and the quality of the serum.</li>
