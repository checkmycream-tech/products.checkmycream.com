      <li>I love these brushes.</li>

      <li>This is too cute but best of all super soft.</li>

      <li>Great, soft, easy to apply brushes.</li>
      <li>I love how these brushes are so soft and so cute :)</li>
      <li>Worth the price :)</li>
      <li>Clean easily.</li>
      <li>However, I feel like there should be one more to make this set worth the price paid.  </li>
      <li>These small brush set is the best on the go set to carry in your purse.</li>
      <li>Nice packaging, soft but also pretty dense.</li>
      <li>I love how soft these brushes are!</li>
      <li>Had to laugh, but these brushes really are amazingly soft and cute!  </li>
      <li>so I have nothing to compare against, but these are just right for me.  </li>
      <li>My first ever set of shadow brushes</li>
      <li>I love the solid tin container they come it.</li>
      <li>These brushes are inexpensive and great.&lt;br /&gt;~The smallest brush is a lining/smudging brush and is curved around the middle, which gives me more control when lining my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;~The</li>
      <li>, sometimes I don&#x27;t always feel that these always do exactly what I want them for.</li>
      <li>&amp; I think the price is pretty reasonable.</li>
      <li>Would have been nice if they were a little cheaper.</li>
      <li>And they really do the job.  </li>
      <li>Bought these for travel as they won&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
      <li>However, the products that are sold here work very well.</li>
      <li>All three brushes are very useful, especially the crease brush.</li>
      <li>If you have first class cosmetics, you need first class brushes, and this are definitely it...</li>
      <li>The brushes are very soft and work very well.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>but some of this on your website is high</li>
      <li>They were unbelievably soft and I&#x27;d certainly try them if I used make-up brushes.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; brush is a little more flimsy than what I wish it was.....</li>
      <li>The lining brush is best used with loose powder, unless you don&#x27;t mind wetting the brush and then lining your eyes a lot because the pressed powder is difficult to pick up.</li>
      <li>Really soft like a teddy bears fur !</li>
      <li>Love the small cylindrical holder, size of brushes, soft bristles, etc.  </li>
      <li>So soft ..</li>
      <li>So soft and blend so well.</li>
      <li>Faced Brushes, all of them are by far my favorites.</li>

    <li> Bought these for travel as they won&#x27;t take up much room. These three cover all the different brushes I need without having to bring several with me. I love the solid tin container they come it. Provides protection from getting smooshed in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> These brushes didn&#x27;t hold up. The largest one broke off the same day I received them. Wouldn&#x27;t buy them again I think they are poorly made.</li>
    <li> Had to laugh, but these brushes really are amazingly soft and cute!  And they really do the job.  Each one is labeled (for the seriously forgetful people like me).  Now I have to purchase a set for my daughter (she thinks I&#x27;m way cool! :)</li>

    <li> The brushes are very soft and work very well. I would buy them all over again. They also come in a pink tin container to keep them all together.</li>
    <li> The packaging is great.  The brushes you receive are also very good.  However, I feel like there should be one more to make this set worth the price paid.  The &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; brush is a little more flimsy than what I wish it was.....but it is still a good brush.</li>
    <li> They do the job and they haven&#x27;t fallen apart after washings. Would have been nice if they were a little cheaper.</li>

    <li> Just purchased these. These brushes work extremely well and holds the pigment very well. Love these brushes! I want to purchase every brush this brand carries.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Worth the price :)</li>
    <li> Love the brushes.  I wanted to get these for about 3 years, but couldn&#x27;t imagine i would like them the way i do, so i didn&#x27;t want to spend the money.  I finally gave in, and I LOVE them!!!</li>
