### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This perfume is a wonderful mix of Coach Poppy and Poppy Flower scents.</li>
      <li>Preferred Fragrance continues to please me with their awesome perfume impressions.</li>
      <li>The best part is my perfume snob friend cant tell the difference when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
      <li>But, as soon as I put some on, I loved it!</li>
      <li>Even though I was not fond of the smeel, I gave it to a friend, and she loves it so still a great product.</li>
      <li>Nice!</li>
      <li>good sized bottle  </li>
      <li>Smells good.  </li>
      <li>good price  </li>
      <li>thank you  and good by</li>
      <li>very satisfied</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>love it..very affordable!</li>
      <li>Would recommend if looking for a nice perfume but at a lower cost.</li>
      <li>The box and bottle are adorable, and the perfume is amazing.</li>
      <li>Strong smell of poppy&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>lol Smells almost exactly like \\&quot;Coach Poppy\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>So this spray is just OK.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I LOVE this smell.  </li>
      <li>Will be buying more for the price.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this perfume as soon as it arrived.</li>
      <li>A very sweet, inexpensive gift.</li>
      <li>ALTHOUGH THIS PERFUME IS A CHEAP REPLICA OF COACH POPPY AND SMELLS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF COACH POPPY FLOWER,  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I like both of the Poppy perfumes, so I really enjoy this &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; of the two in Touch Popular.</li>
      <li>I JUST WISH IT SMELLED MORE LIKE COACH&#x27;S ORIGINAL POPPY.....</li>
      <li>I compared this &amp;#34;Touch Popular&amp;#34;  perfume to them, and it smells like a mix of both, but leans more toward Poppy Flower than the original Poppy.</li>
      <li>It should have smelled clean and refreshing, but to my easily irritated nose, all it gave me was a severe sinus headache.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to find</li>
      <li>For as cheap as this is I&#x27;m not complaining since I do like the smell</li>
      <li>It was cloying and cheap smelling.</li>
      <li>This scent first of all, is lovely.  </li>
      <li>I am a Coach poppy blossom fan but had never tried the original poppy.  </li>
      <li>I was not keen on the idea of spending so much for the name brand until sure, so this was an inbetween.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and lasts a while, would highly recommend to anybody that enjoyed the Coach perfumes, especially those on a budget.</li>
      <li>I said, it might be fine for most, but if sharp, clean, air-ish scents irritate you, it&#x27;s better if you skip this one.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and floral.</li>
      <li>its fresh and light but for me has lasted much longer</li>
      <li>love the bottle and the smell makes me want to get the real thing , smell don&#x27;t last long but smell really good , worth the money</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how close it smells to the real thing!</li>
      <li>Instead it smells exactly like Coach Poppy Flower.</li>
      <li>Did not smell as much like Poppy as I would have liked, but for the price I guess I expected too much.</li>
      <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t last long but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>and like i said the price was reasonable</li>
      <li>Not to mention, it&#x27;s WAY easier on my wallet than buying the real deal.</li>
      <li>jSmells like the real coach Poppy  product  </li>
      <li>I really like how this smells, however it doesn&#x27;t smell like Poppy at all.</li>
      <li>The perfume is not exactly Coach smelling, but very sweet and similar enough I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, bottle was very similar to the real thing.</li>
      <li>I really like it so far.</li>
      <li>In my opinion this smelled nothing like Poppy--it smells more like a heavy floral air freshener.</li>
      <li>It is strong enough to last through the day.</li>
      <li>As long as you don&#x27;t put on too much, it&#x27;s not overwhelming, and it&#x27;s a very unique perfume!</li>
      <li>When I first got this product, I was a little worried because just smelling it, it was kind of odd.</li>
      <li>It smells almost exactly like it and it stays on for a very long time!  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have super high expectations because of the price and some of the other reviews, but was gladly proven wrong.</li>
      <li>a very SHARP POWERFUL ONE.  </li>
      <li>(I know, weird description, but I&#x27;m trying to get the idea across to people like me who do not have as much experience with perfume and can pick out each and every note in one squirt :) )</li>
      <li>mine barely smells like anything at all.  </li>
      <li>I cant even use it, shipping was fast but not worth the money when I cant even use it</li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t last long at all, and the smell is alright.  </li>
<li> then I expected.  </li>
<li> It smells kinda like fabric softener mixed with cut grass and a dried wildflower sachet rolled into one.</li>
<li> It has a strong unpleasant scent, almost like a flower that was just picked out of the garden.</li>
<li> Not only does it have a strong unpleasant flower smell, but it has a strong alcohol smell which is just sickening</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not something you notice from sniffing the nozzle of the bottle, it has to break down on your skin for it to come through.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
<li> This I purchased, because I found a little fift set of lotion, and roller perfume of $1.00 at Christmas.  </li>
<li> IT&#x27;S WORKS SO UNBELIEVABLY NICER WITH MY BODY CHEMISTRY.</li>
<li> Maybe i got a weak one</li>
<li> Not happy at all , the sprayer will not work</li>
<li> im very unhappy .</li>
<li> I HATE IT!!!!</li>
<li> this was the worst smelling perfume I have ever had.</li>

    <li> Like the price! This I purchased, because I found a little fift set of lotion, and roller perfume of $1.00 at Christmas.  Then went on line and found it for sale in larger form. Nice!</li>
    <li> In my opinion this smelled nothing like Poppy--it smells more like a heavy floral air freshener. It was cloying and cheap smelling.</li>
    <li> love it..very affordable! i would definatly order this again.It was easy to find and like i said the price was reasonable</li>
    <li> I HATE IT!!!! this was the worst smelling perfume I have ever had. It has a strong unpleasant scent, almost like a flower that was just picked out of the garden. Not only does it have a strong unpleasant flower smell, but it has a strong alcohol smell which is just sickening, I AM SOOO DISSAPOINTED!</li>
    <li> I have a magazine with a scratch n sniff page, that has Coach Poppy, &amp; Coach Poppy flower on it. I compared this &amp;#34;Touch Popular&amp;#34;  perfume to them, and it smells like a mix of both, but leans more toward Poppy Flower than the original Poppy. Preferred fragrance also makes an impression of Poppy Flower, which I haven&#x27;t smelled yet, so I wonder which Poppy it smells like? Luckily, I like both of the Poppy perfumes, so I really enjoy this &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; of the two in Touch Popular. Not to mention, it&#x27;s WAY easier on my wallet than buying the real deal. Preferred Fragrance continues to please me with their awesome perfume impressions. :)</li>
    <li> It smells almost exactly like it and it stays on for a very long time!  I really like it so far.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this perfume as soon as it arrived. The box and bottle are adorable, and the perfume is amazing. It smells fresh and floral. A very sweet, inexpensive gift. I will be buying this again.</li>

    <li> This scent first of all, is lovely.  It smells kinda like fabric softener mixed with cut grass and a dried wildflower sachet rolled into one. (I know, weird description, but I&#x27;m trying to get the idea across to people like me who do not have as much experience with perfume and can pick out each and every note in one squirt :) )&lt;br /&gt;  The problem is: as soon as I sprayed this on my skin, a somewhat &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;airy&amp;#34; smell started to seep through....a very SHARP POWERFUL ONE.  It should have smelled clean and refreshing, but to my easily irritated nose, all it gave me was a severe sinus headache.  I ended up having to sell it to a friend at work.  It&#x27;s not something you notice from sniffing the nozzle of the bottle, it has to break down on your skin for it to come through.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it might be fine for most, but if sharp, clean, air-ish scents irritate you, it&#x27;s better if you skip this one.</li>
    <li> So this spray is just OK.  It doesn&#x27;t last long at all, and the smell is alright.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> jSmells like the real coach Poppy  product  good sized bottle  I would buy it again  good price  thank you  and good by</li>
    <li> Did not smell as much like Poppy as I would have liked, but for the price I guess I expected too much.</li>
    <li> Before ordering i had read a lot of reviews saying this smelled alot like Coach Poppy. mine barely smells like anything at all.  Maybe i got a weak one</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, bottle was very similar to the real thing. Packaging was as suspected. Would recommend if looking for a nice perfume but at a lower cost.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how close it smells to the real thing! I wear it all the time and I get compliments on it all the time. Strong smell of poppy&#x27;s! I got mine for $5 on sale... Hmmm $45 or $5? lol Smells almost exactly like \\&quot;Coach Poppy\\&quot;. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like how this smells, however it doesn&#x27;t smell like Poppy at all. Instead it smells exactly like Coach Poppy Flower. For as cheap as this is I&#x27;m not complaining since I do like the smell but the title is a bit misleading.</li>
    <li> ALTHOUGH THIS PERFUME IS A CHEAP REPLICA OF COACH POPPY AND SMELLS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF COACH POPPY FLOWER,  IT&#x27;S WORKS SO UNBELIEVABLY NICER WITH MY BODY CHEMISTRY. I JUST WISH IT SMELLED MORE LIKE COACH&#x27;S ORIGINAL POPPY.....ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE..I&#x27;D CONSIDER BUYING IT AGAIN.</li>
