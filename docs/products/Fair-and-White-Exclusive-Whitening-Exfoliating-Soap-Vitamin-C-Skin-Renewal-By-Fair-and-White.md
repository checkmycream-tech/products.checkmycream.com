<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Arrived on time .pleased.</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent. The smile is super good. I have been using it for 4 years. It is expensive a local store thanks Amazon&#x27;s for putting in at a cheap price here. DO NOT THINK TWICE this soap is very good for any type of skin. I remmamded this to my friends we all have different skin color and texture yet we all love this soap</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. It helps keep your color and doesn&#x27;t smell very strong. My skin is slightly lighter and definitely cleared dark marks on my face, which is why I got this soap in the first place. It&#x27;s not an over night miracle soap and as long as you keep using it it will work.</li>
    <li> This product is good.. It has cleaned my face just in a week when I started using it. My friends been asking me what I am using on my face.. I am so proud to tell everyone about this product.</li>
    <li> This soap is just ok and it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> My overall rating is fair. Not the best soap I&#x27;ve used for cleaning clearing up the skin . I found the soap to burn my skin after a few washing. Of course as you know the skin adapts very easily after a week no more burning sensation.Would not recommend as I&#x27;ve used better</li>
    <li> didnt work for me though but i like the smell</li>
    <li> I FEEL THAT SOAP DOES NOT DO MUCH FOR ME , IT DOES NOT LIGTHNING MY SKIN THE WAY IT SUPPOSE TO</li>
    <li> Worst product ever. Doesn&#x27;t do what it have claimed to do. Not only that it leaves a gritty feeling afterwards but it makes you smell so bad. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I loved it, but loved the blue one more :)</li>
    <li> Very nice works great on my skin amazing smell definitely would reorder</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bars, I am almost done with the second bar, I am yet to see any effect. It&#x27;s no different from a normal toilet soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is big. It smells good and fresh. I don&#x27;t know about the exfoliating effect but I can tell it has the apricots on it. I cannot tell for sure if the brightening effect works for me, as I am not even halfway done with it, it probably will be using this soap for more than two more months or maybe even three.</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me and very pricey. My face was in the worst shape with acne with scars and blemishes. It may work for someone with less complex skin. I wasn&#x27;t looking for the benefit of brighter skin complexion so much and I didn&#x27;t see it doing that either if you ask me. It sure did not even my tone or improve my skin complexion. It even irritated my skin but then again I was on acne meds as well. Take you chance but did nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this soap because my skin is so smooth and soft. I have noticed a change in my complexion, my skin looks flawless. I recommend this soap to anyone who has discoloration issues, blemishes and blotchiness.</li>
    <li> Great and immediate results.  Exellent product for discoloring skins.  Totally satified with this soap and highly recommend it. A must purchase!</li>
    <li> I love  this product it&#x27;s  amazing  I&#x27;ve  been  using  this  soap now over 3 months  and it&#x27;s taking away  almost  all  of the discoloration  on.  my face</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of brightening soaps and this by far is one if the best. It brightened up my acne scars a lot in just a short period of time. I may start using it on my body soon. This soap wakes my face up in the morning and I love the fact that it has vitamin c in it! I will be ordering this soap again. Oh, and not to mention that the bar is Huge! It will last awhile for sure.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 3 months now. It exfoliates really well. The size of the soap also makes it last long. Good product</li>
    <li> Very nice because it&#x27;s mile and soften my skin</li>
    <li> delivering on time i will order agin</li>
    <li> Love ﻿the fragrance and the aftermath of its texture on my skin.its lather is cool and it also last long.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.... Good at controlling break outs and does lighten your skin</li>
    <li> Refreshing and with c vitamin I feel that my body looks really bright.. Thanks..</li>
    <li> Not really sure if it works. I used it with the cream saw little effect.i can&#x27;t recommend this to any body.</li>
    <li> Just received cream and soap about one week ago, i am quite please with result so far.</li>
    <li> This soap is fine, but it is SOAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up trying to use it on my face and used it on my body only.</li>
    <li> This soap leave your skin feeling smooth, only been using it for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Dries out the skin fairly easily. If your not a fan of oranges, do not consider this soap as it will make you smell like oranges. Does not lighten the skin, but dries and tightens it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this unless you have naturally very oily skin.</li>
