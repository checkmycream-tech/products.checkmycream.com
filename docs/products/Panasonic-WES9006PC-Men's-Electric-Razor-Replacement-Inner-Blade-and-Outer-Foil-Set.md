      <li>This is the best investment you&#x27;ll make to prolong the life of your shaver.</li>
      <li>Excellent foil &amp; cutter for Panasonic&#x27;s linear series shavers.</li>

      <li>Great price for these items that are quite costly</li>
      <li>I am impressed with this razor and the new heads are perfect.  </li>
      <li>this fit perfectly on my shaver, made it quieter, and shave a lot closer than it had</li>
      <li>My shaver, a Panasonic ES8152, isn&#x27;t mentioned on the WES9006PC packaging, but the screen assembly and blades fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>The razor does an excellent job of shaving....quite close and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Best price and free shipping</li>
      <li>I find the ES8095 superior to all.</li>
      <li>The outer foil will fit perfectly and the blades will work, but they will not \\&quot;snap\\&quot; into place.  </li>
      <li>But even then, compared to what people pay for those refills for their fancy Mach 7 Nitro Nuclear Fission razors, I think we&#x27;re getting a good deal.</li>
      <li>I had forgotten how good it can be.</li>
      <li>If it was cheaper, I would replace them more often!</li>
      <li>I absolutley love my linear ES8092!  </li>
      <li>Helps you remember what you liked about your shaver.  </li>
      <li>If you own the ES8168S, ES8168, ES8167, ES8164, ES8163, ES8162, ES8807, or ES8161, the correct part number you need is the WES9065PC</li>
      <li>And the new blade works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Dealing with Amazon was quick and easy and I got a very good price.</li>
      <li>The Panasonic shaver is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>Makes my electric razor perform almost as good as did originally when it&lt;</li>
      <li>I find the shave isn&#x27;t nearly as good as with the original design.</li>
      <li>Though this kit is not listed as a replacement for that particular razor, the parts fit perfectly and are seemingly identical.</li>
      <li>Have used several of these over the years of having the shaver and each one has performed perfectly</li>
      <li>Seems ok.</li>
      <li>I got these about a week ago and changing the foil and blades introduced a notable improvement in the performance of the razor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy 1 or 2 more before this item becomes unavailable.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I always get a better shave as soon as I replace them too.</li>
      <li>most of the time.  </li>
      <li>also have a top of the line Braun electric with an automatic bath cleaner that needs to be refilled almost every month.</li>
      <li>As others have noted, this part is not compatable with many of the Razors Amazon claims it is.    </li>
      <li>I love the panasonic razor.</li>
      <li>We paid about $150 for his shaver more than 6 years ago</li>
      <li>I have now ordered both the Norelco replacement floating heads and the Panasonic replacement heads and screen (after maybe 15 years or more).</li>
      <li>This was a really worthwhile purchase.</li>
      <li>what is not to love?</li>
      <li>It really is great to restore the shaver to new condition.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I was able to find it now a decade after my original purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although it did improve the razor&#x27;s performance, I think the razor had been dropped too many times and this was the primary cause</li>
      <li>Most sites do not indicate that the WES9006PC can be a replacement for the model ES8152, but the two components fit just fine.  </li>
      <li>Easy to replace.  </li>
      <li>All was easy on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Despite other reviewer comments, this was a perfect fit for an ES8092.  </li>
      <li>Your shaver will be almost as good as new.  </li>
      <li>It is almost as good as new now.</li>
      <li>The outer foil was fine.</li>
      <li>The product was recived in fine fashion.</li>
      <li>Your price is cheap</li>
      <li>HAVING TRIED A NORELCO I FOUND THIS TO BE SO FAR SUPERIOR</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and great price and absolutely will buy here again.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice to put on a brand new foil and cutter because it shaves so easily and close.  </li>
      <li>I suppose it would be cheaper than buying them seperately, but it is a huge hassle to clean the blades, or</li>
      <li>my Panasonic shaver had originally given me.  </li>
      <li>I wonder if it matches the quality of the original.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s original equipment.</li>
      <li>Keep it clean and replace these heads every six months</li>
      <li>I just kept it clean and rotated the blades around.</li>
      <li>The only thing I wonder is how Panasonic&#x27;s own website can try to charge this at $60 when Amazon has it for more than 30% off that.</li>
      <li>The shaver was much quieter with the new blades and foil, as well as being more effective.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need to cut myself any more with a straight razor.  </li>
      <li>fit, look and feel EXACTLY like the original.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure they still made replacement parts, because it was an older shaver.  </li>
      <li>I had forgotten how quick and close a shave</li>
      <li>I kept my original shaver docs and found the right number.</li>
      <li>Each time, I struggle paying the $$, but then realize that I don&#x27;t have to buy replacement blades for a standard razor and 1+ years of use is a pretty good deal.  </li>
      <li>The new blades hold more securely than the old ones that used to fall off easily.    </li>
      <li>Good product free shipping and about 40% less than on the Panasonic site.</li>
      <li>My Panasonic shaver now runs much smoother, quieter, and the shave is close and smooth.</li>
      <li>So far I am really pleased with the Panasonic after all these years.</li>
      <li>And trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>I rarely use a shave gel or cream, and I still get a fast and smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Other than that, this one was a very good replacement for my old shaver.</li>
      <li>This may sound like an Ebay buyer&#x27;s comment, but the shipping was great, 3 business days, with serious overkill on packing.</li>
      <li>I hope you should get right one.</li>
      <li>Put it in the charger and it charged &amp; fired right up.  </li>
      <li>If you look at it another way, this is a cheap way to avoid buying a brand new shaver!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it at first, but after 2 years my face was becoming tender from using the Panasonic razor.&lt;br /&gt;After replacing the 3 items in this package, the razor is like new.</li>
      <li>These replacements work fine and give a shave like a brand new razor.</li>
      <li>Strange thing is, Panasonic&#x27;s own website takes you to this WES9006PC as a replacement foil &amp; blade kit for ES8152, but on the product itself model 8152 is not listed.  </li>
      <li>They are quite easy to install, and make your razor function pretty much as new.</li>
      <li>Runs more quietly also.  </li>
      <li>I will come back and give it a fifth star  if it works more than  the 3 weeks the Norelco worked ( but then stopped working meaning</li>
      <li>Seems to be an exact replacement for an ES8152 shaver although it&#x27;s not mentioned on the packaging.</li>
      <li>The product is exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You get exactly what you paid for.  </li>
      <li>With sharp blades, it is a very smooth, comfortable shave...and much faster than using a blade.  </li>
      <li>Within an instant my husband was thrilled and said it feels like he&#x27;s using a brand new shaver.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used several of these over the years of having the shaver and each one has performed perfectly</li>
    <li> My shaver, a Panasonic ES8152, isn&#x27;t mentioned on the WES9006PC packaging, but the screen assembly and blades fit perfectly. The new blades hold more securely than the old ones that used to fall off easily.    The old screen and blades were the originals from about five years ago. The change was so gradual that I didn&#x27;t realize how much they had worn.    The shaver is so quiet now and feels so much smoother on my skin that it didn&#x27;t seem like it could possibly be cutting my whiskers. However, it shaves closer than ever and with no irritation, especially when I use it wet with a little shaving oil. This was a really worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> These are the factory standard foil and cutter blocks for the Panasonic shaver.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver for 4-6 years and replace the cutters and foil every... eh, not quite as often as I am supposed to. It works well--decent even shave with no razor burn. I DO have to pass over some areas a handful of times (and touch up under the chin/neck with a blade), but don&#x27;t end up with road rash like I used to from my former shaver.</li>
    <li> I absolutley love my linear ES8092!  I use my shaver to shave my face as well as my head so I am very hard on the blades.  I decided after a year of use it was time to get new blades and WOW!  The shaver performs like new again!</li>
    <li> It is a great disappointment with Amazon when it pushed to sell a product, WES9006PC replacement inner blade and outer foil combination for pro curve linear shavers without indicating that they are not compatible with the Panasonic ES8162S Pro Curve Elite Convex Wet/Dry shaver I purchased. Amazon displaced those two products next to each other as though if I made a purchase those products together I would save money. Now I was forced to buy one more shaver that would be compatible with WES9006PC replacement.     &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> brought my Panasonic shaver back to new, BUT I have had problems with geting \\&quot;pimples\\&quot; if I do not clean it enough, and then still sometimes anyway.  After reading about the new shavers that come with a cleaning/drying stand I decided to soak it in 90% isopropanol after each use and then dry it off with a hair dryer (~1 min blades/foil head), solved the problem, no more pimples on my face.</li>
    <li> As others have noted, this part is not compatable with many of the Razors Amazon claims it is.    If you own the ES8168S, ES8168, ES8167, ES8164, ES8163, ES8162, ES8807, or ES8161, the correct part number you need is the WES9065PC</li>
    <li> The blades arrived within a couple of days and they save   Me from having to purchase a new razor.  They work great!</li>
    <li> Despite other reviewer comments, this was a perfect fit for an ES8092.  The shaver was much quieter with the new blades and foil, as well as being more effective.</li>
    <li> Like a brand new razor, showed up in a few days works great. I like to replace every six months to keep the cutting clean</li>
    <li> Product was New and as described.I wasn&#x27;t sure they still made replacement parts, because it was an older shaver.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> So these are just needed to keep using the product not too much to say. other than lower the price I can nearly buy a new razor at this price!</li>
    <li> This was a good upgrade but it still is too expensive. If it was cheaper, I would replace them more often!</li>
    <li> Very good replacement kit. It would be nice if you could buy it for a little less because I think $30 is too much for the replacement while you can find the new shaver on sale for $60. Other than that, this one was a very good replacement for my old shaver.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades restored my shaver to like new performance and they were a breeze to intstall.</li>
    <li> Just got this replacement kit for my ES8152NC. Though this kit is not listed as a replacement for that particular razor, the parts fit perfectly and are seemingly identical. Unfortunately for me, Amazon lowered their already competitive price $6 a week after I bought this kit.. so I bought another one.. Ha..    It really is great to restore the shaver to new condition. I had been using another razor to supplement this one as it dulled. Now, I really won&#x27;t need to do that... and I have another kit waiting for next year... All is well on the shaving front now.</li>
    <li> I used this razor on my legs. the replacement guards and blades are too much money. I&#x27;ll probably be looking into the NONO hair remover by seporia.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PANASONIC RAZOR ABOUT A YEAR AGO FROM AMAZON AFTER HAVING TRIED A NORELCO I FOUND THIS TO BE SO FAR SUPERIOR TO THE NORELCO OR TO THE BRAUN THAT I HAD BEFORE THERE WAS NO COMPARISON.   PURCHASING THE REPLACEMENT FOIL AND SHAVERS HAS MADE IT JUST LIKE THE DAY I BOUGHT IT, BEST SHAVE EVER.</li>
    <li> As has been mentioned in other reviews, this product will work with an ES8152.  When I swapped the parts on mine the sound when from a loud VRRRRRRMMM to a quiet bzzzzz, and the shave was much improved.  This is one of those things where you can hardly tell it is wearing out, but when you swap in the new parts you&#x27;ll know it immediately, especially if you haven&#x27;t changed the parts in 2+ years like I had.  The only thing I wonder is how Panasonic&#x27;s own website can try to charge this at $60 when Amazon has it for more than 30% off that.</li>
    <li> I have used blades, Norelco electric, Remington electric, Braun electric, and Panasonic WET/DRY shaver ES8095 in that order. I find the ES8095 superior to all. Quality of shave is excellent. Cleaning/maintenance is simple and quick. WES9006PC replacement cutter blades and foil every year or two years provides new quality shaving with insignificant degradation of shave quality in the interim. Replacement cost equates to ten cents or 5 cents per shave respectively based on one or two year replacement with unit cost of $35.50.</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you paid for.  A replacement blade &amp; a replacement foil.  They are quite easy to install, and make your razor function pretty much as new.</li>
    <li> Take a look at the photo of the cutter.  Panasonic changed the design so it&#x27;s not made up from a series of individual cutting disks.  Now it&#x27;s just a piece of steel stamped with slots.  I find the shave isn&#x27;t nearly as good as with the original design.</li>
    <li> Makes my electric razor perform almost as good as did originally when it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggest annual replacement or whenever it drags, even after cleaning.,</li>
    <li> This is my second replacement order for the blades and foil.  Each time, I struggle paying the $$, but then realize that I don&#x27;t have to buy replacement blades for a standard razor and 1+ years of use is a pretty good deal.  BTW, each time I&#x27;ve replaced the blades it was due to dropping the shaver!  It only takes one use after replacing to realize why you should regularly change the blades--you fall in love with the shaver all over again.  If you look at it another way, this is a cheap way to avoid buying a brand new shaver!</li>
    <li> The product was recived in fine fashion. The item was the same thing I would have paid quite a bit more for at some other place. The only thing different was one of the blades was out of its original posiion in the package. No problem though.</li>
    <li> I waited too long to replace the foil head and cutters. My Panasonic shaver now runs much smoother, quieter, and the shave is close and smooth. Just like when it was new. Oh, and best price was with Amazon.</li>
    <li> Changing out the outer foil and blades was a breeze. Though my morning shave wasn&#x27;t bad, with the new blades in place, it is great. I rarely use a shave gel or cream, and I still get a fast and smooth shave. I had forgotten how good it can be. Just like having a new shaver again.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used...long lasting easy to clean and it stay&#x27;s sharp...</li>
    <li> Dealing with Amazon was quick and easy and I got a very good price.</li>
    <li> This item completely refurbished my ES8092. I have owned it for over 5 years and had never replaced the blades or foil. I just kept it clean and rotated the blades around. Now it runs quietly and it is like having a brand new razor. I would buy again. Good product free shipping and about 40% less than on the Panasonic site.</li>
    <li> My husband had this Panasonic razor for quite a few years and replacement blades and foils are needed from time to time.  The razor does an excellent job of shaving....quite close and smooth.  These replacements work fine and give a shave like a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> I got these about a week ago and changing the foil and blades introduced a notable improvement in the performance of the razor. It is almost as good as new now.</li>
    <li> Excellent foil &amp; cutter for Panasonic&#x27;s linear series shavers. This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve used.  Foil &amp; cutter work extremely well &amp; fast.  Shave takes about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten how quick and close a shave my Panasonic shaver had originally given me.  Putting these replacements on was like getting a brand new shaver.  And it&#x27;s even quieter now too.</li>
    <li> This is my second combo replacement, the first having suffered my toddler&#x27;s wrath (amusement?). It&#x27;s original equipment. One note, however, my shaver (model ES8152) is older than the ones listed for ordering. I kept my original shaver docs and found the right number. Shaver works just like new, and it has some deluxe features you get now for big $$$.    This may sound like an Ebay buyer&#x27;s comment, but the shipping was great, 3 business days, with serious overkill on packing.</li>
    <li> Product was ordered based on the reviews posted. My shaver&#x27;s performance is 100% improved!! Should have done sooner. Thanks</li>
    <li> Panasonic WES9006PC Replacement Inner Blade and Outer Foil Combination for Pro Curve Linear Shavers     The head had damage. I was not satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Good razor but blades don&#x27;t last long enough and are expensive.</li>
    <li> Replacing the inner blade and outer foil on my Panasonic shaver made ALL the difference.  I didn&#x27;t realize why, but finally noticed that the shaver wasn&#x27;t working well.  After replacing the blade and foil, it takes a fraction of the time and produces a much smoother shave.</li>
    <li> My shaver works like it was brand new again. The blade and foil are a little spendy though, because your lucky if you can a full year&#x27;s use out of them.</li>
    <li> This replacement cutter set makes your shaver like new again for a third the price of a new one.  Helps you remember what you liked about your shaver.  Manufacturer recommended duration is two years but I change mine every year for the new shaver feel.</li>
    <li> I love the panasonic razor. I have been using it for the last years. I change the blades once a year. It still works very well.</li>
    <li> You really need to replace the foil and blade for these Panasonic rasors about once a year or so. They degrade slowly so you almost don&#x27;t realize how dull it can be.  With the replacement its like new again.</li>
    <li> The blade and foil combination is the least expensive way to go to replace both of these parts. &lt;br /&gt;They fit, look and feel EXACTLY like the original.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of value in replacing shaver blade, and ability to find compatible replacements. All was easy on Amazon. And the new blade works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> The replacement item for my razor restored it to \\&quot;like new\\&quot; condition. Shave is once again excellent. Next time, I will not wait so long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Panasonic electric shaver for nearly 3 years now.  After about 2 years, the blades need to be replaced.  And trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.  With sharp blades, it is a very smooth, comfortable shave...and much faster than using a blade.  The Panasonic shaver is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  It blows Norelco and Remington out of the water!  If it should ever break or get lost for some reason, I&#x27;d buy another one in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I forgot what I was missing.  I be getting one of these every year.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried replacing the inner blades on my Panasonic ES8092.  These replacement blades do not fit securely on the shaver like the original blades did.  They&#x27;re always crooked and can&#x27;t stay straight.  When you turn on the shaver, you can hear the blades improperly hitting the outer foil.  Either mine were defective, or they&#x27;re just not compatible with model ES8092.  The outer foil was fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice to put on a brand new foil and cutter because it shaves so easily and close.  I get about one year of use and then I have to purchase a replacement again.  They are ridiculously expensive so sometimes I just buy a new one for just a few dollars more.  I have tried all other brands of electric shavers (Braun, Remington) and nothing beats at Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have used this Panasonic razor for years and these replacement blades and foil have always brought the performance of my razor back to \\&quot;like new.\\&quot;  I buy one set a year.  Those with thick beards may need one more often.</li>
    <li> This was for my husband - he raves about it!</li>
    <li> This package did the job for me.  After installing on my ES8092 shaver, the shaver worked like brand new again.</li>
    <li> Makes your razor operate like new.</li>
    <li> My razor is like new again and runs much more quiet. And I get such a closer shave now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these replacement parts for almost 10 years and they have never let me down. I&#x27;d continue to buy them if my wife didn&#x27;t just gift me a replacement Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Your shaver will be almost as good as new.  Shaves closer and faster, and charges last longer, apparently since the blades aren&#x27;t thrashing around as much.  Runs more quietly also.  Cons:  Not cheap, but you get what you pay for.  Note:  Seems to be an exact replacement for an ES8152 shaver although it&#x27;s not mentioned on the packaging.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would use the electric razor as much as I have - but I have not used regular blades in over a year.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic ES8092 for a decade now. wow. Anyways, this replacement kit has mad it like brand new!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about any  of the other shaver models, but this fit perfectly on my shaver, made it quieter, and shave a lot closer than it had I&#x27;ll probably buy 1 or 2 more before this item becomes unavailable. I&#x27;m just glad I was able to find it now a decade after my original purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the breaking in period where my face felt a little razor burned for about a week.</li>
    <li> By the way this product is the replacement blade for the 8152 model as well, even though the description fails to include it.  This is the best investment you&#x27;ll make to prolong the life of your shaver. With a new foil and blades, the machine feels like new again.  It&#x27;s quieter, less vibrations, shorter shaving time, and prolongs the charge.  Should have bought this months ago when my shaving time seemed to double.  Beats buying disposable blades, especially since the fancier ones would cost you around a $100/year.  Spend the $40 bucks and your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> Most sites do not indicate that the WES9006PC can be a replacement for the model ES8152, but the two components fit just fine.  If you look at the two  parts -- the  blades and the foil, individually, the replacements are listed for that model but this kit isn&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s a way of saving money.</li>
    <li> This item is NOT for ES8152, as reported in other postings for this product.  The outer foil will fit perfectly and the blades will work, but they will not \\&quot;snap\\&quot; into place.  So if you take off the foil head for cleaning, the blades will fall out.  You have to look very closely (with a magnifier) to see the difference between the blades.  Strange thing is, Panasonic&#x27;s own website takes you to this WES9006PC as a replacement foil &amp; blade kit for ES8152, but on the product itself model 8152 is not listed.  I suppose it would be cheaper than buying them seperately, but it is a huge hassle to clean the blades, or even empty out the head after shaving.</li>
    <li> Your price is cheap but I can&#x27;t use, because it is defective. I returned this one. Also I had same experience with WES9006PC when I bought at the end of 2007 with price of 45.98 from you - I couldn&#x27;t use blade either. I attached the blade when I return new one to you a month ago. I hope you should get right one. I am not sure if I can get WES9006PC from you in the future. Anyway I have new one from other site with price of 54.98 and have no problem.    Thanks,</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not completely happy with the electric shaver that it goes with &amp; would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> When my father passed away 8 years ago I got his ES8092 Panasonic Shaver. At one point I got new inner blades for it, and it did not really seem to perform any differently, and I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect from it anyway. Well, now that I finally got it together to buy a &#x27;Replacement Inner Blade and Outer Foil Combination&#x27;, I am absolutely blown away by the results. The shaver is so much quieter, and smoother running, not to mention how quickly, and closely it shaves my beard, which I am figuring is about an average beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it at all, just buy this kit! You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have now ordered both the Norelco replacement floating heads and the Panasonic replacement heads and screen (after maybe 15 years or more). The Panasonic works like a charm . I will come back and give it a fifth star  if it works more than  the 3 weeks the Norelco worked ( but then stopped working meaning no more Norelco close shaves). So far I am really pleased with the Panasonic after all these years. I simply can not believe how smoooth quick and close a shave I get with it.</li>
    <li> Worked as it should.  Great price for these items that are quite costly most of the time.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I took out my old Panasonic razor after two years of non use because I needed new blades.  Put it in the charger and it charged &amp; fired right up.  I am impressed with this razor and the new heads are perfect.  Don&#x27;t need to cut myself any more with a straight razor.  I highly recommend new blades for your old Panasonic razor.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! My electric shaver is once again like new.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm in my OLD Panasonic razor that needs a freshening up.  Best price and free shipping what is not to love?</li>
    <li> The Replacement Blades &amp; Foils for My Panasonic Razor made it work like brand new and at a fraction of the cost of a new razor.  Why buiy a new razor when you can make it work like a new razor.</li>
    <li> I went too long without replacing the blades and foil on my shaver.  Shaving was getting to be a real chore.  But replacing these was like getting a whole new shaver!  It sounded and felt different, and I could feel I was getting a much closer shave.  The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that after a month or so of use, I have noticed the blades have already dulled a bit.  I may start replacing mine every 6 months or so.  But even then, compared to what people pay for those refills for their fancy Mach 7 Nitro Nuclear Fission razors, I think we&#x27;re getting a good deal.</li>
    <li> The comb and shaving blades do the job they were manufactured to do.  They give me a close shave without irritation.  I have had this shaver for a few years and this is third time I&#x27;ve replaced these items. This is the best electric shaver I have owned. It&#x27;s more expensive than many others but, as the saying goes, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it at first, but after 2 years my face was becoming tender from using the Panasonic razor.&lt;br /&gt;After replacing the 3 items in this package, the razor is like new. Shaves are closer than ever and with less irratation.&lt;br /&gt;I also have a top of the line Braun electric with an automatic bath cleaner that needs to be refilled almost every month. The Panasonic with new blades does a better job; especially if you lather up with a bit of shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Unless the shaver is damaged, you can get the same results after the first year of use,by just replacing the inner blade as Panasonic recommends, once a year. They recommend that the outer foil be replaced every two years.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great price and absolutely will buy here again.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item at least six times previously and every time it exactly as described.  My Panasonic shaver is like new again.</li>
    <li> Although it did improve the razor&#x27;s performance, I think the razor had been dropped too many times and this was the primary cause for it&#x27;s decreased performance.  By decreased performance, I mean that the razor was causing razor burn and/or outright cuts in my skin.  Trying to adjust closeness didn&#x27;t help.  That said, this was still the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I upgraded to the newest Panasonic razor, and it was very disappointing in comparison.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon, I looked for these parts locally and could not find them. My old made in Japan razor needed these made in Japan parts to keep it alive. Seems many only want to sell you a new made in China version of this razor for a price that&#x27;s higher than it should be.</li>
    <li> worked for years great product</li>
    <li> Still a very good product, in my opinion.  Easy to replace.  This is used on a wet and dry shaver that I&#x27;ve used for a very long time. And it still works well.  Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> Seems ok. I wonder if it matches the quality of the original.</li>
    <li> Within an instant my husband was thrilled and said it feels like he&#x27;s using a brand new shaver. We paid about $150 for his shaver more than 6 years ago so this is a minimal investment to shave with a like-new device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Panasonic razor for over 7 years I think now and it still works great.  Keep it clean and replace these heads every six months and it just keeps on going.  I have found the quality of the replacement heads to be the same over all these years.  I always get a better shave as soon as I replace them too.</li>
