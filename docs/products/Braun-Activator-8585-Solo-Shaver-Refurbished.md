      <li>The Braun Activator 8585 Solo Shaver, factory reconditioned, is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>For the time being I believe the Braun 8585 is probably the best value for an electric shaver on the market.</li>
      <li>This is the best foil shaver.</li>
      <li>: This is a truly excellent shaver.</li>
      <li>If you need the best and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot, this is the one.</li>
      <li>At $69 an excellent value.</li>
      <li>The cutter was in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>I saw this incredible offer.</li>
      <li>The razar performs flawlessly and that is good for a guy who hasn&#x27;t shaved in 30 years and had forgotten how.  </li>
      <li>After researching on line I found great reviews of teh Braun Activator.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>Great product, no broblems, works great - can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>Great purchase</li>
      <li>In this situation the pop up trimmer works great to shorten the hair before you do a close foil shave.  </li>
      <li>and tips:  Best shaver on the market, shave is close and easy on the face.  </li>
      <li>that I&#x27;m delighted that I&#x27;ve switched.</li>
      <li>Purchase a Good Remington, wouldn&#x27;t use it, it pinched.  </li>
      <li>Without the station this is still the best shaver available.</li>
      <li>This model 8585 succeeds my 7000 series after the clipper got defective.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this razor.</li>
      <li>YOUR FACE IS THE BETTER THE SHAVE!  </li>
      <li>Item was exactly as described and all items were included and in perfect shape.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just too good a price for an outstanding electric shaver.</li>
      <li>sure this is a good deal and all.....</li>
      <li>The station is available seperately on a very popular auction site for about $40, so you will have the option.</li>
      <li>So, now I&#x27;m hesitant to try any more of the top of the line Brauns, even though they get good ratings.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best electric shaver ever made.</li>
      <li>My rotary 8400 series also takes work and still isn&#x27;t the shave I want, but it offers the best tradeoff of closeness, ease, and time.  </li>
      <li>, you understand that you have an \\&quot;extra\\&quot; shaver for free!</li>
      <li>Foil shavers are often better then rotary shavers for shaving the beard and moustache area of the face, which is where almost everyone uses them and it is what they are designed for.</li>
      <li>The 8585 may be slightly better on the neck area.  </li>
      <li>you consider that about $40 for blade and knives + about $20 for the cord are already MORE then the price you pay</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what a factory recnditioned shaver was</li>
      <li>/&gt;Therefore I have a 8995, and now you better listen to me: &lt;</li>
      <li>I would have been confident to go through a Marine Corps inspection having used this 8585.</li>
      <li>had now 6 Braun (all still WORKING!), and I changed just to get the latest models.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for another great and pleasing purchase.</li>
      <li>I decided to replace it with this after reading many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After using the 3612, without pinching and it doesn&#x27;t leave a rash, I decided to get a better one.  </li>
      <li>more?</li>
      <li>I saved quite a bit of money and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of the purchase.</li>
      <li>The 3612 is an inexpensive shaver, however, I was unwilling to spend more for an electic shaver at that time because they have never worked for me.  </li>
      <li>bought the braun, thought it would be better than the remington that I was replacing.</li>
      <li>if you need a shaver to shave your body, or a curved area like a head or kneecap, then rotary is much better.</li>
      <li>The razor seems bulkier than the 7526 probably because it doesn&#x27;t have as good a grip (the 8585 does not have as much rubber grip on it).  </li>
      <li>The Braun shaver is comfortable, quiet, and has very good run time on each charge.</li>
      <li>Self cleaning is a bonus, and when on road trips I can get a week out of one charge easily.</li>
      <li>Best electric shaver on the market but only marginally better than the much cheaper Braun 7526.</li>
      <li>I have compared prices and this is a SUPER BUY!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, and the battery lasts and lasts.  </li>
      <li>cord/battery charger, a brush and a cheap case.</li>
      <li>perhaps they filled their landfills.</li>
      <li>The shaver does leave a smooth finish.</li>
      <li>So, I bought another Braun traveler (rounded ends), and it wasn&#x27;t as good as the old one (squared ends).  </li>
      <li>(read the reviews for the \\&quot;new\\&quot; 8585 for more information) except for the area right under the nose.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying DE now, and it is very good, though still not what I expected (low cost, excellent shave, not excessive work).  </li>
      <li>I take the foil off after every shave and tap it in the sink then lightly use the brush to clean the foil.  </li>
      <li>The 8585 has a good look about it, looking slightly more modern than my old 6520.  </li>
      <li>One nice improvement in the new Braun is that the power cord clicks into the bottom of the razor.  </li>
      <li>Just spray alcohol on the blades and foil when you want to clean them.</li>
      <li>but u dont get the renew and clean charger thing.  </li>
      <li>Keep the head clean to extend cutter life.  </li>
      <li>I have had this shaver a month now and just clean it manually after every shave.</li>
      <li>It might remember to pull a brush out in clean of foil every six months or so.</li>
      <li>The Braun 8585 feels comfortable in the hand and the face and shaves quickly and fairly close without taking multiple passes.</li>
      <li>It also has a full two-year warranty</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the type to buy anything that is used or \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot;, but I really needed a good shaver, and a brand new one was not in my budget.</li>
      <li>Put some in your hands and rub it on the face being sure to rub it in against the grain of your hair in order to raise the hair up (particularly on the neck).  </li>
      <li>satisfied and highly recommend this shaver.</li>
      <li>Overall, very pleased.</li>
      <li>It felt like the 8585 needed fewer strokes and caught the hair better in its new improved shaving foil.  </li>
      <li>Also the reconditioned model I received was not in as good a condition as I had expected.  </li>
      <li>:  Not as good as I had expected when compared to the Braun 7526.  </li>
      <li>Fully recommend this razor as it does a much better job than my old rotary wisker rippers.  </li>
      <li>So, I decided to try this one expecting it to be at least as good or better than the traveler, plus changeable blades, but that was not the case.  </li>
      <li>Foil shavers will pass right over longer softer body hairs without doing a thing to them, whereas a rotary will remove that hair.</li>
      <li>I may end up purchasing it though after reading how it works as it seems like it would really keep the razor clean.</li>
      <li>I have been using electrics my entire life and there has never been one better.</li>
      <li>The only thing is, it is time to replace its blades and that cost more than I want to spend.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers since the first models in the &#x27;60&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>The shaver provides a very close, smooth shave and it is quite an improvement from my old Braun.</li>
      <li>The price is high and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>other nice improvement with this Braun is that the mustache trimmer comes straight out at a 90° angle from the trimmer body.  </li>
      <li>After purchasing the highly rated Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve I returned it for this Braun 8585 solo and believe I made the right choice.</li>
      <li>My old Norelco lasted forever and in fact it still works, but I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly electric shavers are improving.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m waiting for a laser razor that will blast it all in a quick complete scan.</li>
      <li>All in all, I like this shaver very much, but it took more getting used to than my other one.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t loose more time and buy it before</li>
      <li>BUT, it&#x27;s so much quieter and smoother</li>
      <li>It works very well on my face.</li>
      <li>The new Norelcos are more quiet sure, but you sacrifice a close shave for a very slight difference in \\&quot;noise\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The 8585 seems like it will clean in a similar fashion, so to me the cleaning unit is somewhat superfluous.  </li>

    <li> The Braun shaver is comfortable, quiet, and has very good run time on each charge.</li>
    <li> Great product, no broblems, works great - can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m not the type to buy anything that is used or \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot;, but I really needed a good shaver, and a brand new one was not in my budget. so I settled for this one -only to find that I was not settling at all!</li>
    <li> bought the braun, thought it would be better than the remington that I was replacing. I was so wrong, takes twice as long to shave as it use too. The shaver does leave a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> This Refurbished Braun shaver was flawless on arrival.  No scratches, dings or dents.  Item was exactly as described and all items were included and in perfect shape.  The razar performs flawlessly and that is good for a guy who hasn&#x27;t shaved in 30 years and had forgotten how.  I have compared prices and this is a SUPER BUY!  Thanks Amazon for another great and pleasing purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers since the first models in the &#x27;60&#x27;s. This model 8585 succeeds my 7000 series after the clipper got defective. Though almost identical the 8585 is somewhat quieter while the shave is definitely smoother with the new foil. At $69 an excellent value.</li>
    <li> I agree with Ronald Arden&#x27;s review.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to shave any closer than my old Flex Integral 5614.  But...It&#x27;s faster shaving, quieter, and seems like a faster motor.  I like the price of the refurbished model.  No cleaning stand, but who cares?  Battery seems to last forever.  Also, the trimmer is a big improvement compared to my old shaver.  Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> After using my Braun 8585 shaver for a month I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave any closer than my elderly Braun 6520. BUT, it&#x27;s so much quieter and smoother that I&#x27;m delighted that I&#x27;ve switched. I actually went back for a few days to the veteran Braun and tried again but the assault on my ears was suddenly intolerable -- it was no contest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It feels as though you are shaving with velvet -- and that&#x27;s smooooth! I guess it&#x27;s a case of not just shaving - but shaving in style.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what a factory recnditioned shaver was so I inspected it closely upon delivery.  Except for a sticker (removable) that identified it as reconditioned, wouldn&#x27;t have known that it wasn&#x27;t a new unit.  No evidence of use, no scratches, no discolorations...nothing.  It shaves well (read the reviews for the \\&quot;new\\&quot; 8585 for more information) except for the area right under the nose.  This reconditioned shaver is not offered with the cleaning system so manual cleaning will be required (my son gave me his cleaning system and I must admit I have gotten spoiled...just drop the shaver into the cleaning unit after each use, press a button and the shaver head is cleaned automatically for the next use).  If I didn&#x27;t have the cleaning system, here&#x27;s what I would do: buy an ultrasonic cleaner ($25 on sale at Harbor Freight), fill with hot water, add a few drops of dishwasher detergent, insert the foil and cutting head (keeping them physically separated) and turn on for 3 minutes.  Rinse, dry and reassemble onto the shaver body.  Repeat every week or so.</li>
    <li> After six years of constant use, my Braun 6520 finally stopped working.  In searching for a replacement, I came across this factory reconditioned model. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fact that this is a refurbished model is of no consequence to me.  It came in excellent working order with no scratches or defects.  It also has a full two-year warranty so it might as well be brand-new. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In comparison to my older Braun 6520, this model is an upgrade.  The 8585 has a good look about it, looking slightly more modern than my old 6520.  The 8585&#x27;s slider button is of a better designed as it is recessed, unlike my previous Braun.  One nice improvement in the new Braun is that the power cord clicks into the bottom of the razor.  On my old Braun, the cord was held in place by friction only and tended to slip out during corded shaving.  The 8585, gratefully, does not suffer from the same problem.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun changed the foil release button style for the new 8585.  It no longer sticks out from the body of the razor, giving it a cleaner look.  On my old 6520, the foil would release directly after pushing the button.  On the new Braun, one still has to tug upward on the foil to disengage it from the shave her head after pushing the button.  While this would preclude someone from accidentally dropping the foil, I never had that problem so the extra step seems unnecessary but is of no real inconvenience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8585 shaves a little bit better and an ever so slightly closer than my old Braun.  It felt like the 8585 needed fewer strokes and caught the hair better in its new improved shaving foil.  I noticed a definite improvement in the shaving of my chin area. The lower neck area however was still a slight problem. My old Braun rated an eight out of 10 whereas this one would rate a nine. There is only a slight difference between a Braun 8585 shaver and the newest blade razor (that orange one).  Unless you&#x27;re pushing down and pulling against the grain, there is virtually no difference.  I would have been confident to go through a Marine Corps inspection having used this 8585. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The other nice improvement with this Braun is that the mustache trimmer comes straight out at a 90° angle from the trimmer body.  My old Braun angled down slightly making it harder to see where you were actually trimming.  Though the trimming head is slightly smaller on the 8585, I find that&#x27;s actually a benefit as I feel like I have better control and can definitely see where I&#x27;m trimming much clearer than before.  It&#x27;s a small yet noticeable and appreciated improvement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As stated in an earlier review, one can easily obtain the cleaning station online either from Braun or other sources. For six years all I ever did was remove the shaving foil, turn on the razor, and bang it against the sink a few times to dislodge the hairs.  It might remember to pull a brush out in clean of foil every six months or so. The 8585 seems like it will clean in a similar fashion, so to me the cleaning unit is somewhat superfluous.  I may end up purchasing it though after reading how it works as it seems like it would really keep the razor clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with the razor and ecstatic over the price.  I can&#x27;t see anyone paying retail for this.  It&#x27;s just too good a price for an outstanding electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Having had 2 of the rotary brand shavers, I felt it was time for a change.  After researching on line I found great reviews of teh Braun Activator.  Got the reconditioned as I use a normal razor during the week and the electric for convenience on weekends and traveling. Didn&#x27;t get the dunk tank but cleaning the head is a snap.  Fully recommend this razor as it does a much better job than my old rotary wisker rippers.  Cleaner smoother when done and no pain.</li>
    <li> The refurbished shaver was in superb condition, just like a brand-new, factory product. Hard to tell it had been ever used. I saved quite a bit of money and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of the purchase. The shaver provides a very close, smooth shave and it is quite an improvement from my old Braun.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the best electric shaver I have ever owned. I have one of those rough, fast growing, thick beards and this shaver gives me a shave that is as close as any wet razer. Self cleaning is a bonus, and when on road trips I can get a week out of one charge easily. Great purchase</li>
    <li> My last Braun foil razor was over 6 years old, and the battery wasn&#x27;t lasting long. I decided to replace it with this after reading many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great--the charge lasts a long time (a few weeks of shaves for me). It works very well on my face. I&#x27;m extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as it being refurbished--it&#x27;s virtually unnoticed. You get a new battery, a new blade, a new foil, and the rest is meticulously cleaned and renewed. It&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal both figuratively and literally. This is by far the best electric shaver ever made. I have been using electrics my entire life and there has never been one better. The price is high and it&#x27;s worth it. It is 10 times the shaver a remington, panasonic, norelco or even previous generation braun have ever been. Read the reviews everywhere, you&#x27;ll see this is the consensus. I bought this one (the solo) without the cleaning station. Without the station this is still the best shaver available. The station is available seperately on a very popular auction site for about $40, so you will have the option. You can save about $50 buying this way and still have the 2 year warranty and the station. I have had this shaver a month now and just clean it manually after every shave. It&#x27;s great. If you need the best and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot, this is the one.</li>
    <li> The Braun Activator 8585 Solo Shaver, factory reconditioned, is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  Other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried in the past either gave me a rash on the neck area or just didn&#x27;t give me a close enough shave.  I&#x27;m 100? satisfied and highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using another Braun Shaver, a Braun 3612.  The 3612 is an inexpensive shaver, however, I was unwilling to spend more for an electic shaver at that time because they have never worked for me.  I have bought, in the past, the Premimum Norelco, didn&#x27;t work for me, always left a rash.  Purchase a Good Remington, wouldn&#x27;t use it, it pinched.  After using the 3612, without pinching and it doesn&#x27;t leave a rash, I decided to get a better one.  Bought this one, and now the 3612 is for travel.  I did well.      By the way, when I don&#x27;t use an Electric Shaver, I use a mug and brush, and I spent $100.00 for the mug and double bladed shaver.  I don&#x27;t use disposibles, too much waste, landfills and money.  The double blade is made in Germany... They been around a little longer...perhaps they filled their landfills.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t change from Braun back to any rotary system. &lt;br /&gt;The Braun doesn&#x27;t give you any pain. &lt;br /&gt;I had now 6 Braun (all still WORKING!), and I changed just to get the latest models. &lt;br /&gt;Therefore I have a 8995, and now you better listen to me: &lt;br /&gt;I bought the spare blades and knives in Wal-Mart at $36+vat...!!! &lt;br /&gt;Then I saw this incredible offer. &lt;br /&gt;The 8585 is very similar (only cheaper body without gadgets like lcd display, etc.), AND uses the SAME blade and knives of 8995 (which are NOT the same of the serial 7000; this 8000 has an improved design of blade, a different inner part of the blade itself, and similar or same knives of 7000). &lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve got? &lt;br /&gt;A 8585 wick looks NEW, and HAS NEW BLADES AND KNIVES. &lt;br /&gt;A cord/battery charger, a brush and a cheap case. &lt;br /&gt;If you consider that about $40 for blade and knives + about $20 for the cord are already MORE then the price you pay, you understand that you have an \\&quot;extra\\&quot; shaver for free! &lt;br /&gt;Some  more? &lt;br /&gt;YES: you can recharge it in the cleaning base of any 8000 (like my 8995), you can exchange their cords (The other one I have has an European cord), and you can use it either for travelling or spare parts as you wish, but you will NEVER regret this shopping. &lt;br /&gt;Last but not least: if you never tried a Braun shaver, this is your opportunity. At this price you can shave for approx 18 months (average life of blade and/or knives, but for my experience goes from 11 to 24 months). &lt;br /&gt;The battery runs for 10-12 days before you need to recharge it; cleaning is very easy (if you don&#x27;t have the self-cleaning base, which does EVERYTHING automatically). &lt;br /&gt;What else do you want? Don&#x27;t loose more time and buy it before is too late, and consider even a VERY nice present for some friend (don&#x27;t consider your girlfriend for that!), father, ... &lt;br /&gt;TRUST me: ALL my old Braun are still working, and I am 52, so the eldest is a piece of museum now. &lt;br /&gt;Do NOT compare the quality of Braunshavers with the poor quality of the Braun electric toothbrush which socks!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for several years now.  No other electric shavers even come close, they have no competition.  It may take you awhile to learn how to shave with it, then it is a snap.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros and tips:  Best shaver on the market, shave is close and easy on the face.  I have sensitive skin and coarse hair and this thing just knocks it out.  It will not pull hairs like other electric razors do.  I frequently let my facial hair grow long.  In this situation the pop up trimmer works great to shorten the hair before you do a close foil shave.  The trimmer will not pull your hair.  Some people will moan about shaving the neck area, they need to read the manual and learn how to use the shaver properly.  Occasionally I use the pop up trimmer to get hairs I miss on the neck.  THE DRYER YOUR FACE IS THE BETTER THE SHAVE!  Do not wash your face before shaving.  It also help if you use Lectric Shave.  Put some in your hands and rub it on the face being sure to rub it in against the grain of your hair in order to raise the hair up (particularly on the neck).  Take a hair dryer on cool setting and blow dry your face for 30 seconds or less, then shave.  You will likely want to change the foil and cutter block every six months (even though they say 18).  If you replace the foil and cutter after 6 months you will be very surprised at the improvement in the shave.  Keep the head clean to extend cutter life.  I take the foil off after every shave and tap it in the sink then lightly use the brush to clean the foil.  Every now and then I will spray some alcohol on the cutter.  The cutter was in excellent condition.  You will want to inspect it carefully since these are reconditioned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not as good as I had expected when compared to the Braun 7526.  It is quieter than the 7526.  The 8585 may be slightly better on the neck area.  The cutter is the same as the 7526, only the foil changed, everything else is identical to the 7526 except the cover.  The 8000 series foil will not fit on the 7526.  The razor seems bulkier than the 7526 probably because it doesn&#x27;t have as good a grip (the 8585 does not have as much rubber grip on it).  Also the reconditioned model I received was not in as good a condition as I had expected.  It required some cleaning and the writing on the back was almost completely worn off.  Of course this did not affect the shave.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Best electric shaver on the market but only marginally better than the much cheaper Braun 7526.</li>
    <li> I bought this refurbished razor rather than repair my previous one. I am very pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> There are two main types of shaver, foil and rotary. This is the best foil shaver. Foil shavers are often better then rotary shavers for shaving the beard and moustache area of the face, which is where almost everyone uses them and it is what they are designed for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But if you need a shaver to shave your body, or a curved area like a head or kneecap, then rotary is much better. Foil shavers will pass right over longer softer body hairs without doing a thing to them, whereas a rotary will remove that hair. But any loose skin will need to be stretched to avoid nicks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This foil shaver gives a beard shave as well as any shaver ever made. It is superb. You do not need the accessory stand that cleans the shaver. Just spray alcohol on the blades and foil when you want to clean them. The cleaning station is a silly gimmick. Buy it solo and factory reconditioned on Amazon to save big. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One tip, no matter what type of shaver you use, do not press it into the skin. The lightest touch will shave you better than a hard press. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Summary: This is a truly excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick beard with hair that grows in odd directions on my neck (problem area). This was too rough and powerful and if i pushed too hard it would burn my skin. With the norelco xl i could at least push as hard as i wanted too. I know it sounds odd, but this was way too powerful for my beard. I tried to switch to this from the norelco quadra action, but i ended up returning this for the norelco xl.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the highly rated Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve I returned it for this Braun 8585 solo and believe I made the right choice. I&#x27;ve had over the years 2 Norelcos and this is my 3rd Braun. My old Norelco lasted forever and in fact it still works, but I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly electric shavers are improving. My previous Braun still works as well, but by comparison the new Braun shaves faster, holds a charge longer and shaves about as close as you can possibly expect to shave with an electric shaver. The Panasonic by comparison doesn&#x27;t even come close to the Braun -- not even my 7000 series Braun.     I&#x27;ve seen other reviews stating the shaver is loud, but this shaver is 10 times as quiet as my 7000 series Braun and every bit as quiet or perhaps more quiet than the Pansonic that I returned. The new Norelcos are more quiet sure, but you sacrifice a close shave for a very slight difference in \\&quot;noise\\&quot;. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone calling the Braun 8585 a noisy shaver by any stretch of the imagination.    The Panasonic shaved decent, but was awkward to handle and it took a long time to get a reasonably close shave. The Braun 8585 feels comfortable in the hand and the face and shaves quickly and fairly close without taking multiple passes. I think my old 7000 series Braun did shave a bit closer, but it took a lot longer to do so and is much noisier that the Braun 8585.    For the time being I believe the Braun 8585 is probably the best value for an electric shaver on the market.</li>
    <li> sure this is a good deal and all.....but u dont get the renew and clean charger thing.  I guess if all you want is the shaver, then this is for u, but you cant buy the stand alone charger anywhere and thats just disappointing.  The razor itself is in new condition and I cant find a thing wrong with it.....just a little mad that it didnt come with the set.  I guess I should have read everything.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and the battery lasts and lasts.  Shaves are quick, but closeness takes a little longer.  Be careful not to press this shaver too hard against your face or it might leave some shaver abrasion.  All in all, I like this shaver very much, but it took more getting used to than my other one.</li>
    <li> Bought this recently on amazon.  I have had Braun electric razors for several years now.   Prior to this I had the Braun 7526.   For whatever reason, I don&#x27;t know if its the new foil on the 8585, but this razor just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my previous Braun.   I am actually going back to my old one.   Not sure what the design flaw is, but definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a review of a purchase from several years ago.  I had a Braun traveler ($10-15 older square end model) and it was one of my closest shaving razors between my rotary, cartridge, and double-edged (DE).  So, I decided to try this one expecting it to be at least as good or better than the traveler, plus changeable blades, but that was not the case.  I think the holes are just a bit small for my hair diameter.  I think the traveler and my rotary have bigger holes.  So, I bought another Braun traveler (rounded ends), and it wasn&#x27;t as good as the old one (squared ends).  So, now I&#x27;m hesitant to try any more of the top of the line Brauns, even though they get good ratings.  All razors take work to get as close as I want.  I&#x27;ve been trying DE now, and it is very good, though still not what I expected (low cost, excellent shave, not excessive work).  My rotary 8400 series also takes work and still isn&#x27;t the shave I want, but it offers the best tradeoff of closeness, ease, and time.  The only thing is, it is time to replace its blades and that cost more than I want to spend.  The quest continues.  I&#x27;m waiting for a laser razor that will blast it all in a quick complete scan.</li>
