      <li>In fact, I have a wonderful naturally flawless look!</li>
      <li>Loved this!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfectly between a matte and a dewy finish.</li>
      <li>And the seller was awesome</li>
      <li>I loved this stuff!</li>
      <li>I purchased this foundation after hearing lost of great things about the brand Make Up Forever.</li>
      <li>I look great.</li>
      <li>and it was great, but she might have done something else along with it</li>
      <li>The foundation was a bit darker than I relised when I recieved it, but it blends in great and should match my summer tone as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The pump works great and doesn&#x27;t flood my face sponge when I&#x27;m applying it.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous foundation</li>
      <li>It is not noticeable and, for me, is the perfect light color.  </li>
      <li>If you have acne scars like me, you&#x27;ll probably also need a good stick concealer.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, we switched and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>Very cute, good cover, I recomenned</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love how this makeup covers and lasts throughout the day!  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really think it covers the best.</li>
      <li>Nice texture and has never made me break out.</li>
      <li>The foundation sets nicely and makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
      <li>I used to rely on Sephora to purchase it and am so thrilled that I found it Prime-eligible on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The lightest layer covers all imperfections so nicely.</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing makeup ever.</li>
      <li>This is by far one of if not the best foundations I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
      <li>My shade: 120 Soft Sand (is my perfect shade)</li>
      <li>Its a nice bottle, feels pretty good</li>
      <li>If you have been looking for that perfect t foundation look no further r, BUT IT !!!!</li>
      <li>, it covers most of my blemishes.</li>
      <li>I also bought 125 since I sometimes have a darker complexion when I&#x27;m more tanned.</li>
      <li>This is definitely the best makeup I have used..  </li>
      <li>It really matches me skin tone great though.</li>
      <li>This product is okay.</li>
      <li>, I love it though.</li>
      <li>Love it and will continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>Love the coverage, I just wish it was more affordable for everyone out there</li>
      <li>I Love this product and would repurchase it.</li>
      <li>+ I love that it&#x27;s a pump  -</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>After using this foundation for the first time I got about 5 compliments in one day on how good my skin looked.</li>
      <li>Easy to use  </li>
      <li>Love this full coverage foundation</li>
      <li>I found the foundation to be really light, and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This is by far, my most favorite foundation!</li>
      <li>this one is very light, I always need to mix it with a darker foundation to make it right for my face</li>
      <li>+ Smooth  </li>
      <li>but my sis-in-law had it and said it was too light for her.  </li>
      <li>Goes on really smooth</li>
      <li>This goes on smoothly and stays all days.  </li>
      <li>Other than that this is a great foundation, it feels very light weight its almost like if you are not wearing any makeup at all.</li>
      <li>Full coverage</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many makeups, I like this one it seems to cover and blend with my under eye concealer very well.</li>
      <li>true colors</li>
      <li>Anyways its not that great, just as good as regular other foundations.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly and coverage is fantastic but not heavy!!!</li>
      <li>High quality product, have never used such a great quality products</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because this foundation is said to be medium to full coverage, and I think its more light to medium.</li>
      <li>The price was great and the results are fabulous I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone for its fresh appearance</li>
      <li>It is just the right coverage for my face.  </li>
      <li>The shade #120 matches my skin pretty well</li>
      <li>I bought a tone that matches up pretty well with my winter skin tone</li>
      <li>It goes on really smooth and it barely looks like I have any makeup on at all.</li>
      <li>This 120 shade is great for those of us with a slight yellow undertone and medium-fair skin.</li>
      <li>It covers very well.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
      <li>The foundation was very water</li>
      <li>I will probably buy this from now on as part of my main make up routine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more than $20 more expensive here.</li>
      <li>Forever&#x27;s foundation covered really well, and light enough that applying a second layer to really cover the redness didn&#x27;t make me look like I had caked anything on my skin.</li>
      <li>I really like the natural finish this foundation gives me.</li>
      <li>(I refuse to damage my skin from purposely tanning, I have the normal winter to summer change in tone).</li>
      <li>Great coverage for scars, dark spots, redness, etc with no clumpy or heavy feel.</li>
      <li>My new makeup.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s buildable and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>I crossed over to using natural products (Perricone, Hauschka)</li>
      <li>but they just can&#x27;t compete with the coverage and natural finish.</li>
      <li>I on the other hand had Mac makeup that was a few shades darker than my own skin</li>
      <li>I use a moisturizer underneath and then just a little amount gives my skin just enough coverage to give me a smooth look.</li>
      <li>foundation is not oily and dries quickly which allows for other layers of makeup to be added almost instantly after applicaction.</li>
      <li>I think it would help with the price (half the size half the price :)  </li>
      <li>I have in the last couple of month started to develop cystic acne (hormonal changes at my age), and no other foundation I used gave me the coverage I needed with out looking completely caked on.</li>
      <li>so you have to be careful not to pump too much out.</li>
      <li>I only paid $43 because I got it from the Sephora website directly.  </li>
      <li>Definitely recommend this to any looking for a light-medium coverage foundation with a natural finish.</li>
      <li>I have been using the HD clear powder for a long time...decided to try this.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this foundation to someone that has tried to cover blemishes or redness with other things that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worth the price and usually lasts me 4-5 months if I use it daily.</li>

    <li> Very cute, good cover, I recomenned</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I also bought 125 since I sometimes have a darker complexion when I&#x27;m more tanned. Its a nice bottle, feels pretty good but I don&#x27;t really think it covers the best. It really matches me skin tone great though. If you have acne scars like me, you&#x27;ll probably also need a good stick concealer.</li>
    <li> + Smooth  + A little goes a long way  + Easy to use  ++ I love that it&#x27;s a pump  - Pricey    I don&#x27;t use makeup every day, so I wished they had a bottle that was half the size. I think it would help with the price (half the size half the price :)  I Love this product and would repurchase it. It&#x27;s a staple in my makeup bag!    For Reference~  My skin: Asian, Medium-fair skin, Slight yellow undertone  My shade: 120 Soft Sand (is my perfect shade)</li>
    <li> I had a wedding last August and I went to a make up artist to get my face done. She used this brand of make up and it was great, but she might have done something else along with it bc this wasn&#x27;t even as close as good.&lt;br /&gt;Also this one is very light, I always need to mix it with a darker foundation to make it right for my face but that is my fault for choosing it wrong. Anyways its not that great, just as good as regular other foundations.</li>
    <li> Love the coverage, I just wish it was more affordable for everyone out there, I love it though. I use (120)</li>
    <li> This is the greatest foundation. I used to rely on Sephora to purchase it and am so thrilled that I found it Prime-eligible on Amazon. It truly does airbrush your complexion, especially in photographs.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know about this makeup but my sis-in-law had it and said it was too light for her.  I on the other hand had Mac makeup that was a few shades darker than my own skin and when I applied you could see where the makeup ended.  Anyhow, we switched and I loved it.  She had very little left so I bought it another.  Goes on really smooth and I don&#x27;t need to apply powder because it&#x27;s oil-free.  My new makeup.  I only paid $43 because I got it from the Sephora website directly.  It&#x27;s more than $20 more expensive here.</li>
    <li> Love this full coverage foundation</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff! This is by far, my most favorite foundation! Too bad its so expensive but in my opinion, I think its worth it!</li>
    <li> I can never go back to another foundation... This is definitely the best makeup I have used..  Full coverage but doesn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
    <li> This goes on smoothly and stays all days.  It is not noticeable and, for me, is the perfect light color.  This is my second bottle of it but a little goes a very long way so it lasts a year or so for me.  I apply every morning.</li>
    <li> High quality product, have never used such a great quality products</li>
    <li> Loved this!!! And the seller was awesome</li>
    <li> I have been using the HD clear powder for a long time...decided to try this.  I love it.  A little goes a long way..but it gives your skin a dewy look....I did find that I need to use a moisture under it....so I use a sun screen moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this foundation after hearing lost of great things about the brand Make Up Forever. I found the foundation to be really light, and easy to apply. It covers very well. I have in the last couple of month started to develop cystic acne (hormonal changes at my age), and no other foundation I used gave me the coverage I needed with out looking completely caked on. Make Up Forever&#x27;s foundation covered really well, and light enough that applying a second layer to really cover the redness didn&#x27;t make me look like I had caked anything on my skin. In fact, I have a wonderful naturally flawless look! The foundation was very water so you have to be careful not to pump too much out. A little goes a very long way. The foundation sets nicely and makes my skin feel like silk. I expect this foundation to last me quite a while considering that it&#x27;s so thin and you don&#x27;t need much at all. I would highly recommend this foundation to someone that has tried to cover blemishes or redness with other things that didn&#x27;t work. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years.  It is just the right coverage for my face.  I use a moisturizer underneath and then just a little amount gives my skin just enough coverage to give me a smooth look.</li>
    <li> After trying this foundation, I don&#x27;t think I will ever try another foundation again. It goes on really smooth and it barely looks like I have any makeup on at all. Not only that, it covers most of my blemishes. After using this foundation for the first time I got about 5 compliments in one day on how good my skin looked. It truly is a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many makeups, I like this one it seems to cover and blend with my under eye concealer very well. I bought a tone that matches up pretty well with my winter skin tone (I refuse to damage my skin from purposely tanning, I have the normal winter to summer change in tone). The foundation was a bit darker than I relised when I recieved it, but it blends in great and should match my summer tone as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation is not oily and dries quickly which allows for other layers of makeup to be added almost instantly after applicaction. The pump works great and doesn&#x27;t flood my face sponge when I&#x27;m applying it. I will probably buy this from now on as part of my main make up routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for 4 stars is the price and availablity. It&#x27;s a little steep and I can&#x27;t find this just anywhere so it&#x27;s a bit of a hassel to order and wait for. :(</li>
    <li> Been using this for years... Gorgeous foundation that&#x27;s buildable and looks very natural. Would recommend to anyone for its fresh appearance</li>
    <li> I love how this makeup covers and lasts throughout the day!  I definitely would recommend this makeup to others. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of if not the best foundations I&#x27;ve ever used!  The price was great and the results are fabulous I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and my skin looks flawless with this product</li>
    <li> Love it and will continue to use it.  Wld recommend to anyone.  my portraits does not lie.  I look great.</li>
    <li> I really like the natural finish this foundation gives me. The shade #120 matches my skin pretty well, I finally found a foundation that doesn&#x27;t look too pink on me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because this foundation is said to be medium to full coverage, and I think its more light to medium. Other than that this is a great foundation, it feels very light weight its almost like if you are not wearing any makeup at all. Definitely recommend this to any looking for a light-medium coverage foundation with a natural finish.</li>
    <li> Para mi que soy mac nc25 , la 120 esta perfecta,  tiene una cobertura mediana y deja un brillo muy especial, muy buena</li>
    <li> Great coverage for scars, dark spots, redness, etc with no clumpy or heavy feel. Nice texture and has never made me break out. Especially good for pictures. true colors, no shine</li>
    <li> Makeup For Ever HD us the ONLY foundation  you will ever use again !!! Once you try it will not believe how your face looks.  It goes on so smoothly and coverage is fantastic but not heavy!!! Wonderful company to work with. Makeup arrived before scheduled date.  I will use them again as a priority !!!!  If you have been looking for that perfect t foundation look no further r, BUT IT !!!!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing makeup ever. The lightest layer covers all imperfections so nicely. I have blemish-prone skin and this, if anything, seems to make my skin softer and calmer when I take it off. I also dislike having to use powder to set makeup, and this doesn&#x27;t run or smear-- no need for powder for me. Yay! It&#x27;s perfectly between a matte and a dewy finish. What can I say, it&#x27;s brilliant! This 120 shade is great for those of us with a slight yellow undertone and medium-fair skin. I crossed over to using natural products (Perricone, Hauschka) a year ago or so, but they just can&#x27;t compete with the coverage and natural finish. Try it!! It&#x27;s so worth the price and usually lasts me 4-5 months if I use it daily.</li>
